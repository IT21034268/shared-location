3,"Sure, it was an interesting read, but...","I wish Wills would write (say that 5X fast) separate books on (a) Wayne's popularity; (b) his life; (c) his movies; and (d) John Ford, Howard Hawks, Harry Carey, Yak Canutt, et al., etc. John Wayne has a supporting role in this book. It's good reading, don't get me wrong, but Wills doesn't nail his thesis on the head. He's more comfortable writing about John Ford's personality than the nature of celebrity in America. So really, we don't need to be told the obvious: John Wayne is still popular because he was so stinkin' good at what he did. Period. To Wills: I like Wagner's music, but I probably wouldn't like Wagner himself. So what. Wayne was a movie actor and did his job well; I enjoy his movies. Full stop. I'd recommend reading this book, though, until the definitive study of Wayne's films comes along."
3,"Long on movie-making, short on America","Anyone seriously interested in John Wayne's position as America's icon needs to read this book, which is filled with information about the making of his films and the evolution of his career.But for the rest of us, the book doesn't come into focus until its conclusion, which, while thought-provoking, comes as an anticlimax. Only at the end does Wills discuss the relationship of Wayne's dominant screen persona with America's self-image. Up till then it's mostly movie-making. All of Wayne's key films are discussed, but almost always with the emphasis on who did what and how. Wills approaches the meaning of the individual films with surprising diffidence for a tough-minded political commentator.Straightforward and fair-minded though it is, ""John Wayne's America"" doesn't fulfill the promise of its title."
3,Lots of Backgound,"John Wayne's America is based on the figure John Wayne. Garry Wills has put so much backgound into this book that it really blowns u away. Not in a bad but the reading of some 300 pages with discriptions of just about everything kinda gets boing after a while. I grew up watching John Wayne with my father and the way that Garry Wills describes him is not what I would picture the duke as being. The book was good though to pass the winter of kansas by. So I'm sure that a more experienced read would come to say that my review was false. However, this is an opinion review and that was my opinion of this book. Garry Wills is a good writer he just doesn't show his best work in this book."
1,WAY TOO SENSITIVE,i got this item for long car trips to the greandparents house & hockey road trips. it skips back to the main menu if touched. also starts playing when standing up but then skips back to start/main menu as well. a waste of $$$
1,Don't Buy this player,"I purchased this dvd player just before christmas-One week after using it, I started to have problems. The battery would not charge. I have to turn it on and off several times inorder to get the controls to work. When I called coby, they said I had to ship it back. But I have to pay for shipping, plus enclose a money order for 18.00 for return shipping and proccessing fees. I will never buy a coby product again. Save yourself headaches and dont buy it."
1,Absurd conspiracy theories. . .,". . .from an author (Balsiger) whose own ""unbiasedness"" has been repeatedly called into question -- not only by skeptics, but by fellow Christians as well.Don't bother."
1,Bad!,"This DVD player did not work well for me. The motor that drives the carousel is very weak and even when it worked it barely moved the tray at all then finally just quit totally.I think if you are going to spend this kind of money - not much, that is - on a DVD player, you should buy a single drive type rather than a spinner. There is just not enough quality in this thing to make it work effectively, its more of a hassle than its worth. Try getting an Apex single player if you are cheap like me and just want something that works."
2,"Interesting, But...","I enjoy reading diaries, especially from the past, and gaining more insight into people's thoughts and feelings. While I didn't dislike Helen Jacobus Apte as much as some other reviewers did, I did think that her diary was a trifle boring. I found myself skimming through parts of it, although it did give a fairly good picture of Southern life in that time period. Overall, I'd say this book was a mild disappointment."
1,"Product Fine, Delivery Service Rude","Amazon.com has subcontracted large product delivery duties to local ""last-mile"" shippers. They were uncooperative with respect to scheduling delivery (rigid time windows) and the driver would not place the product where my wife (who just had a baby by C-section) asked (""we only have to get it through the door, lady). Amazon was not responsive to my complaints about the scheduling difficulties and told me I could cancel the order but would have to pay shipping charges. I guess books are a little easier to ship. Next time CIRCUIT CITY OR BEST BUY."
1,not the best tool for me!,"I requested this for Christmas, thinking that it would help with organizing the busy life of working Mom by helping to remember those 'little things' that my 'pre-menopausal brain' tends to quickly forget. --- DON'T BOTHER!!! The recorded message comes out more garbled than a teenager's language, (Which, eerily enough, I am beggining to understand!) And, as an added bonus, the small flashlight didn't work. The darn thing cost $9.99, and shipping costs (here and back) cost close to $12.-! Don't buy this!!"
4,Project Games,"Coyle gave a great story. He was very descriptive. His writing had the affect to make me able to visualize every character and setting. I've spent time in the projects on many occasions' with friends who stay there and I see these things all the time, except children are growing more love for basketball and football. Yet they still show the heart on the court and gridiron as they did in this story in the diamond."
4,Not Great,"Not great, but good. However there are a few really good songs on this double album. Unfortunately you will probably skip through most of it. Enough said."
3,relaxing story,"I have read many of the McComber books, this one is clean, interesting, relaxing..I read a second one but haven't had time to read more of them. I'm enjoying my Kindle. :-)"
5,Color Management for Photographers,"Congratulation to the author. One of the best technical book I have ever read. Scientifically precise, very informative, relatively easy to understand. Some minor changes in the editing could further increase it's value."
3,I'm Calling It 'Decent',"This surprised me. I thought it was going to be garbage. Thankfully, it wasn't. As someone has said previously, it takes bits from The Omen, Rosemary's Baby, and I would add The Wicker Man. So, it isn't too original. The acting, though, is quite good, especially Laura Harris, who has an uncanny resemblance to Jennie Garth. To the person who said they couldn't believe they'd wasted two hours on this -- you overslept, 'cause the movie is only 89 minutes long."
2,Excellent Printer - LOUSY software!,"The C6180 is an awsome AIO printer/scanner/fax etc, the print results and scan quality are outstanding. I think the prices for the (6) ink cartridges are fair, in that you only have to replace the color you have run out of... but it may run you $70 + to replace all of them!The HP software has more bugs than a tropical rain forest.....It's just awful, bloated and certainly not 'Noob' friendly.... common errors seen are on start up and close down causing OS to freeze and lock (Win XP). I have installed it on 3 PC's in my home (also a lengthy affair - akin to doing a fresh install of Windows....!) and they all behave badly now, so not an isolated case. I can't vouch for the friendliness it shares with Apples OSx (I would guess it may be better going by the number of Apple promo's bundled within the box...).Summary - GREAT Printer - Software Sucks"
1,C6180 GARBAGE,"I almost never write reviews, but in this case I have to say something.I am an electrical engineer. I know technology. But boy, did I ever make a mistake buying this HP printer. Nothing like the reliability of my old HP 2100 LaserJet.This is the worst designed piece of junk I have ever used. Do not buy this printer!! Do not accept it as a gift!!It is S..L..O..W! It takes many minutes to turn on and configure itself for a simple scan or print job. It is almost laughable, except that it isn't.If a cartridge is low on ink, it is difficult to override to just print in black. Obviously, a machine designed to try to force you to buy more and more expensive ink cartridges. Also, the ink level sensors are touchy, and it will tell you that a cartridge is low or empty when it isn't. Then nothing will print. Until you buy more ink!HP Photosmart C6180 All-in-One Printer, Fax, Scanner, and Copier"
2,HP Junk,"I have had numerous HP AIOs and my last one, a psc2400 was great. It got fried by lightning last summer and I purchased this one in a rush, basically because it had a document feeder and it was an HP. It constantly thrashes around adjusting itself and is very slow to copy and print. I have a wireless connection and have been on the phone with HP tech on 2 occaisions because of what is basically a software problem. The last time they installed a patch that prevents ""sudden uninstall "" of the software, which was only one of my problems. It also would not print to the spooler, which also required new software. I have had printers since 1984 and this is the worst. HP stopped making this machine after a short time, and has another almost identical unit with a differen model number. Stay away from this printer, even though now they are almost free."
1,Worst printer I have ever owned,"Bought this for the multi-function capability. I did like the way it produced pdf's directly from the scanner, however had numerous problems with the software.As a printer the quality was fine, it just uses a lot of ink (if you skimp and try and make the cartridge's last a long time they ""expire"" and need to be replaced whether they are full or not).About a week ago I started getting the message that the ink pump was not working, now it is stuck in a powercycling loop (tries to start, shuts down, tries to start, shuts down, etc).Customer service has been less than helpful to put it nicely.In under a year of very light home use, it is now nothing but a large paperweight that makes printer startup noises over and over if plugged in."
1,Piece of junk,"HP should be ashamed to put out such a piece of garbage. This rattling, shaking, vibrating, raucously loud machine is not even fit as a toy for a 2 year old, never mind as an important addition to any home office. If it only had more blinking lights, this plastic box would entertain more toddlers than Elmo. Meanwhile it will frustrate the heck out of any person looking for a quality all in one. Save your money and buy a Canon or Epson. HP used to make quality goods, no more. Price comes first, quality a far far second. If you want an expensive gag gift as a joke, go ahead and buy it."
1,JUST A SCAM TO SELL MORE INK!!!,"I will never buy another HP after owning this printer for a few years.It has 5 separate ink cartridges that are virtually guaranteed to either be empty or EXPIRED at any given time!I think I've printed in color maybe a dozen times since I've owned it, and the whole machine refuses to function if there is an empty or expired cartridge. It is coupled with the worlds SMALLEST paper tray, so if by some miracle all 5 cartridges are full, and not expired, then guaranteed it'll be out of paper!!Every single time I have to use it, I contemplate taking it out to pasture and beating it to oblivion with s baseball bat, office space style. When I do, rest assured I WILL NOT BE REPLACING IT WITH ANOTHER HP!!! It's no wonder they are losing customers left and right. This level of ink sales greed has crossed the line!!!"
2,Good Printer/ Bad Scanner/ Terrible Software/ Awful Customer Support,"The scanner is pathetic. Quality of scans is much worse than my Epson 2400. Software is not very well designed. Customer support promises to call you back in two hours and never does. Online support addresses the wrong problem. Printer and copier however are pretty good. Wireless was surprisingly easy to set up. If you want a printer and copier, this is OK. If you want high quality scans, cross this one off of the list."
3,Check the scanning!!!,"People,I went to a local store to check out this printer along with a Canon. This printer looked great until we made a copy of a 5x7 photo. The original had beautiful blues and yellows. The copy that was printed dulled the colors and was lifeless. It was very disappointing. A HP rep was there and he said something was wrong with it... But a C7180 did the same thing! The Canon mp830 looked great. I am an HP fan, and hope they can correct this. :-("
2,"Works, but... ech","This unit replaced my old AIO 7410, which I LOVED. This one just feels cheap. The construction is cheap, parts are loose, and it feels like a child's toy, not an office tool. Given the choice, I would not buy another one."
4,HP All-in-One Printer,"Works very well. Has a small footprint. There are alot of printer cartridges to regulate & replace. Have not tried the fax function yet. Does not print as fast as advertised & makes alot of weird noises. Overall, it does the job I need it to do very well; and I like the HP programs that let one use scan & other functions very well. I am happy with my purchase. I haven't tried the photo function yet. Hope this helps:)"
3,Moments of greatness,"There are so many good tracks here, but the whole album lacks cohesiveness which i think is important for this type of music. The songs here show little resemblence to what they inspired (Gabriel's wonderful Passion) and they have a much more earthy feel to them, 'Yorky' and 'Tejbeit Ethiopian Bar Song' being prime examples with such a fresh flavour to them, even after repeated listening. Yet whilst taken at their own merit, it still has the feel of a compilation, and it's perhaps best to look at the album as a taster record for each artist. Whilst it in no way compares to Passion proper, it is still a welcome addition to any music collection, and avoids the uneasy 'fusion' flaw that dogs too many Realworld releases."
4,Light-hearted and lots of fun.,See Alec Baldwin and Kim Basinger on screen together for the first time in a comical and heart-warming rendition of the classic boy-meets-girl story - with an enormous twist! The plot is brilliantly funny and the supporting cast includes Paul Reiser. Kim and Alec are superb together - great actors. The Marrying Man is a definite Must See!
3,a fairly entertaining comedy,"This is quite an entertaining movie about a millionaire who gave up everything he own for the only woman he loved. The ending is quite predictable. With an outstanding supporting cast, including Paul Reiser, and ofcourse the sizzling chemistry between Baldwin and Basingser."
3,One of their best,"I've outgrown this band, but when I was still listening I thought this one , Look Now... and A Better Version... were their best. The Atlantic cd is also good. Skip the demo and the live cd. Can't speak for the new stuff, but I liked the singer (and the band) better before her makeover."
1,Save a few bucks,"I have to agree, beautiful illustration, but P.S. everyone...MADONNA IS NOT THE ARTIST...kudos go to Ms. Long. Seems lately any celebrity can 'write' a story, find a great illustrator and they have this amazing piece of children's literature. Purchase some Roald Dahl."
4,"Brilliant Art, Wise Message, Okay Storytelling","I picked this one up because I'm a Madonna fan, and I really enjoyed her storytelling in the first book ""The English Roses"". Also I'd seen the cover art and was just blown away by its beauty. Loren Long creates a world that's equal parts Norman Rockwell and Edward Hopper, but it's as though you're looking at it reflected onto a fun house mirror, with slightly distorted shapes and proportions. The illustrations are, quite simply, beautiful works of art. The story itself is an important one about the power of words and the way in which gossip spreads like a virus. A simple story, and a rather good one for children to learn early. What I missed here was the charm and sense of playfulness Madonna exhibited in her first children's book. Nevertheless, I highly recommend this book. Young children, I'd say ages 4-9, should really enjoy this, and be enchanted by Long's pictures."
1,children are not stupid,"a publisher with any inegrity would never have taken on this bad book. or the first one. i would bet if this had been done by anybody else, it would never have been published.i think the artwork is horrible, anorexix children and a lot of cheesey-nees throughout. this is just a matter of taste of course, but i also don't understand why any illustrator with a reputation would have taken on this daft book and have their name forever connected to this."
1,I loved when she said she wanted to give,I am glad she included it in her books. It is a lesson we want to teach all of our children.
4,Why pay 50$+?,"So i bought these speakers just for playing music with my ipod. Thats what it did. If you put it to loud the sound quality goes bad but you can just lower it a bit a it sounds great! Don't spend 45+ to paly your music when these can do the same.Pros: Small, loud, good sound quality.Cons: The way the soung jack wire was put makes it not as neat as how the picture looks."
3,Folding speakers ok!,"I guess you get what you pay for,lol! I only paid seven bucks for them,but I thought they would be a bit louder and the built-in cord is too short,it just barely fits on the stand that comes with it.Other than that it arrived pretty quick.I'm ok with it,but I am looking for a louder portable speaker dock."
2,ummmmm.....crap.,should of know by the price and reviews. got it in the mail. cheap. didnt work on the get go and then all of the sudden it did. my god...the sound coming out of this thing is sad. no really. two stars because i should of known better.
2,Well..,"This is one of the worst products I've ever bought. Where should I start?1. It sounded good the first day. However, now it makes a terribly loud feedback/clicking noise.2. One of the most important thing for a portable speaker is its ability to be...portable. Battery power does not work on mine.3. It's also rather poorly designed, and with no instructions, it is a bit hard to figure out.I recommend this to no one."
5,Perfect for the price,This little gadget exceeded expectations it was actually louder than i expected the only bad thing was how short the cords are if your like me and like skipping songs than it would piss u off once ina blue but if u let it play hey is pefect for you
3,Insten Folding Speaker,In view of the price I wasn't disappointed. However the sound quality is entirely consistent with the cost of the unit.
1,sound quality is below average.,"it does not look like the one on the picture.1. no brand, no manufacture, no brochure ot anything. should be a OEM thing.2. quality is very bad materials, connection and esp. the sound."
2,Not quite good enough - even for the price.,"I was going to give these speakers high marks just because they're speakers, they work, and they're ridiculously cheap.But for just a few more dollars you could have a nice speaker like theAltec Lansing Music Speakeror for a few more bucks, theAltec Lansing iM-237 Orbit Ultraportable Speaker for MP3 Players (Silver), which I just bought and it sounds phenomenal for such a small battery-powered speaker.Getting back to these, they have a nice little setup, though the audio cable is a bit too short. The speakers fold open for decent stereo separation. But you may find yourself maxing out the volume, as these aren't very loud - then again, you probably wouldn't be looking at small portal speakers if you needed to fill a room with music.The sounds is very tinny and it sounds like...well, cheap speakers. They'll do in a pinch but you'd be better off spending a few bucks more for something else."
3,Not Loud Enough Even on Max. - But You Get What You Pay For,"Only paid $2 + s/h, so can't expect too much.They work ok, but not loud at all even on maximum volume.But, small and portable as desired."
2,didn't last,"good while they worked (about 6 months), but used lots of batteries and didn't work with the A/C adapter I got to use with it."
2,Meh,I didn't even use it that much because it was just ok. Not very loud at all. I ended up selling my old ipod & I gave this as a free gift with it.
3,SL,Works fine but is a bit cumbersome to attach and carry around. I've since bought one that has a soft case with external speakers. Much better.
3,tiny speakers,"I like to listen to books I've downloaded onto my iPod in my car, but hate the in-and-out of using FM stations when driving. I open my console, pop iPod into the little speaker system, turn it on, and I'm ready to roll. A bit tinny sounding when the volume is up (on the freeway), but hey - they cost next-to-nothing. I'm happy enough for the price."
3,Not very loud,These speakers are ok if you only want to listen by yourself in a small room. The speakers do not producer very loud or high quality of sound.
2,What do you expect for 5?,I read the reviews and thought to myself if it is a POS then I only lost 5 dollars. I did.The construction of the product is not bad and it is simple to use. The sound however was worse than my blown speakers in my JBL.Sometimes you can hear the vocals to the song sometimes you can't. It very spotty. Neat little gadget but not for any sort of good sound.Hope this helps.
1,Worthless!,Worthless junk! I could barely hear the tinny sounds coming out with volume set at highest level. Don't waste your five bucks- get a burger instead!
1,Don't waste your money,"First off, product you receive is not labeled Insten like the one in the picture, which leads me to believe it is not the same product as pictured. These speakers are worse than horrible. I thought with the cheap price it would be worth trying since the reviews are either good or bad. But don't waste your time or money."
5,NOT discontinued - coming out Sept 8 as planned,"don't know why it says (today anyway, sept 5) item discontinued - it is not, this is a mix up on Amazon's part, this is coming out on sept 8 as advertised!"
2,"Vague, poorly organized","The book (5/ed) has a poor and loose structure, and even with plenty of (vague) discussion, it fails at teaching. The material is at a high level (senior or preferably above actually), but that's not my problem with this book. Rather, my concern is the lack of clarity and ability to click with the reader, especially in the first seven or eigth chapters, where fundamentals are covered.There are excellent alternatives, though, on control systems, most notably N. Nise (currently in 5th ed.) and, to some extent, K. Ogata."
1,Sucks,Well first off the book does not do a good job of providing sufficient examples on how to do things. On top of that the solution manual you can get online through those 2 ppl that are selling it is useless. It has all the problems worked out wrong...just my luck!
1,Defective tape,"This movie is defective and skips. It starts off showing video stops. Skips..not good!! How do I go about getting refund or another movie. Had family over to view Obama interview, very disappointed!! Didn't want to give it any stars at all."
3,Functional but perfunctory if not dull.,"I ordered this book expecting pictures, charts, and simple lists of the things I need to do to make things work on the run. Instead, I'm finding as much prose as in the ""Dummies"" series, but the style is so flat, static, and detached that it's less engaging and helpful than the ""Dummies"" book by David Pogue or ""My Imac"" by Gore et. al. A computer like the Imac deserves a style as zesty, colorful, inviting as its subject. This may be my newest book on the Imac, but it's my last choice of texts."
3,tactful handling of an uneventful subject matter,Not a great book for chess enthusiasts concerned about Anand's games..yet it sheds some light on this Super-genius's life as a `human' which normally today's GM's have no touch. Humorous setting makes it a fun for collectors of Biographies..Not at all a bore but not for a serious chess player.Book is good but the price isn't !
5,Good work!,"A very good, but unfortunately a very forgotten album too! Nothing like their first thrash albums really, has a lot of references to Alice In Chains I think, but you can still count this a as a thrash album with many heavy metal influences.Warren Conditi really does shine on this album, and it's a pity he didn't sing on Cult of One as well! Best tracks are Left Unsaid, Lack of Contrition, title song and perhaps the best, epic Strangeface, which could originally be written by Deep Purple or some other 70's legend.The production could be a bit fatter to my taste, but this does top it's predecessor in every possible way!"
5,Captivating,Being of Polish extraction this book appealed to me like no other. I felt I was right there with him whilst he was in the middle of all this carnageHighly recommend!
5,Truly extraordinary book.,I read this book in the 60's & never for got it. Gave it to my 16 yr old grandson for Christams. He is a history bufff. Can't wait until he finnishes it.
1,Surprising Disappointment,"I was surprisingly disappointed with the design and function of this product having long enjoyed a much earlier model of Panasonic CD player (SL-S260) for many years. The Panasonic SL-SX420 model referenced-above has hard-to-use diminutive function buttons; its round discus-shape is hard to hold onto while walking; one has to open the lid, remove the CD (more handling near the laser lens) just to change out the batteries; and its maximum volume (""25"") seems artificially low (must be the tort lawyers input here). In general, I'd take a pass on this model."
2,OK but not great,"I've had my unit about six months. The cost is low, and the anti-skip works good. But my biggest complaint is with the volume. Full volume on this unit might be 3/4 volume on other units. I always have mine on full volume, and it's not what I'd consider loud. Lately, mine is having problems playing MP-3's. I'm not sure if the problem is with my MP-3's or this unit, but I'm going to buy a new (different) unit."
3,accepetable,"I would really have liked if the CD went acording to the levels and order of exercises for Vaganova Syllabus. The adagio snd petits battments were too fast, and it is missing a grand adagio. Other then those few problems it is quite good, and the music sounds the way each movement is suppose to be done which is wonderful."
3,Good movie.,"I really enjoyed the movies but the picture was too blown up to fit my 37"" TV screen. I would of preferred the full screen ratio version better even though it would not of filled the whole screen. So if you have a wide screen TV 32"" and above don't buy the ratio: 1:33.1 or it does look too blown up. Again, the movie was really good."
4,Don't pay what this seller is selling it for!!,"This is a great track. However, this person wants almost $80!! Are you kidding. I bought it at Toys R Us for like $12-13 dollars last winter. What a joke!!!"
3,Great Band... Bad songs...,"This album hides amazing musicianship behind over-production and bad songs. When you listen, you feel the band just below the surface trying to find space and ""really"" perform. But even talented musicians can't make bad songs sound good. The album will grow on you after you listen 100+ times... but music shouldn't be this much work. Like so many people have said, the album sounds like it was written in 10 or 11 days... I hear that the album was called ""Everyday"" because DMB needed to write one song everyday. We are ready for a better DMB album. Real depth can be heard on the DMB - ""Lillywhite"" CD... Lillwhite was not officially released but can be found on-line in MP3 format. One listen, and you are home - the best DMB since ""Under the Table"". Releasing ""Everyday"" and hiding ""Lillywhite"" was a crime. Or is there some master plan to release ""Lillywhite"" after we've wasted our money on ""Everyday."""
3,"What's there is good, but there's something missing.","If you're expecting the kind of music that you could imagine yourself listening to with a small gathering at a live performance, this is not it. This is the most ""studio"" sounding of all the albums for sure. There are, however, some highlights, such as So Right and Angel, and of course the radio singles.DMB's three strong points are its songs, its style, and its incredible instrumental talent. This album has the first two, but instrumental talent is definitely eclipsed. Before These Crowded Streets remains my favorite album because it has strong examples of all three. You can enjoy Dave's vocals and the pensive songs just as much on this album, but if you're familiar with their earlier work, you'll know what's missing."
2,DAVE MATTHEWS : What happend?,"I SAW DAVE MATTHEWS THE FIRST TIME IN 1993. I WAS 14 YEARS OLD AND I WAS HOOKED, AS A DEDICATED FAN THROUGHOUT THE YEARS I HAVE BEEN WAITING FOR THIS ALBUM, ONLY 2 BE CRUSHED! I DISLIKE THIS DISC AND THE STYLE OF MUSIC PLAYED ON IT. RED ROCKS IS DMB THIS ALBUM IS A 1.5 on my grading scale."
1,not good,"bad very bad i suppose they have been smoking too much of the funny stuff? he does say ""i did it"""
5,cool,"Yea, it is different, and it's obvious there's a new producer with this one. But I don't care. It has voice and it has soul and dammit it has electric guitar. The songs still make you want to get up and dance around with your arms waving and your eyes closed and your feet doing something unexplainable. Buy it. It's good."
4,Give this a chance!,"Yes, it is not the typical DMB album, but it is still great. I see alot of fans putting this down, and am upset by that. I live here in Charlottesville, where the band is from, and from what I am hearing, there may not have been much more DMB if they did not make some changes. So, as this is not the old DMB with their 10 minutes jams, it is still them and still great. I am an old fan, and will stay with them through their transitions, which is what every true DMB fan should do!!"
2,Thoroughly Boring and Blah,"I was excited when I heard that DMB was coming out with a new album. I went out and got it right away. Now I cant even stand to listen to over half of the songs. Before These Crowded Streets was a little letdown, but still very good. This is boring, uninspired, rehash, resting on laurels album.There are a couple of good tunes in there, but nothing to buy this album for. If you are in question, pass this one up. I found U2's and David Gray's albums walked all over this one. I hope they can do better next time."
4,slightly dissapointed,"ok so i love the new departure... it took a little warming up to, but i am hooked....i think that these new songs are going to be great improv jam sessions with a lot of energy in the summer tour... anyway to conclude, definately *buy this*, it is a must for any dave fan!"
2,Not up to par,"When I first got this disc several months ago, I hated it. But, sometimes things grow on you and you learn to appreciate qualities that you didn't pick up on initially. That has not happened here, in fact, I may actually dislike it even more now. Bottom line is that the disc feels like it was pulled together in a week with drab and uninspiring songwriting. I've always felt that DMB's first three major label records were excellent, but this one is a big disappointment."
3,I like it,"I am not a hard core music junkie and it's not my favorite album but its good. Good enough for me to buy and I don't buy a lot of music. I, however, also own some of their other albums and this is not their best work as a band I really like their sound."
2,I'M SO DISAPOINTED,"FOR ME BEING AN VERY DIVERSE MUSIC FAN[AND LONG TIME DMB FAN],I was very disapointed with EVERYDAY.Where's the rawness andjazzy vibe of BEFORE THESE CROWDED STREETS? And what's up withthe synthizers,pop sappiness,and blandness.Glen Ballard[EVERYDAY's mastermind] may work well with average-soundingartists like Alanis Morrisette.But Dave Matthews' moan,Tinsley'svoilin,and Carter Beauford's precise drums are all the ""production"" they need.""The Space Between"" is bland andpop but it is pretty and grows on you.My favorites on this albumare ""Mother Father"" and the title track.That's when I actuallyheard the real Dave Matthews Band become the Dave Matthews Bandagain.EVERYDAY isn't horrid but it is a disapointment to a lot ofDMB's fans!"
4,I listen to it Everyday,"Upon first placing the cd into my stero i was very exicted. after listening to it once i thought to myself, not so great. not until listening to all the tracks did i realive it's true potental. Now i listen o it all the time. It is by far DMB's most diverse album yet. All different songs are here. ballades to rock(and So right reminds me of Say goodbye). i could not give this 5 stars because there are better albums of his and if you had to choose between this or a live album, i would go for the live one. this does by no means make it a bad cd. it has to be gotten use to for anyone to enjoy it, i.e. i never really liked What you are, but now its one of my favs. this IS worth your money even if you only listen to it for a while. the different beats can satisfy anyone, for the die hard fan to a newbie. i strongly recomend this album to anyone who likes a change."
2,What happened to DMB?,"Overproduced is putting it lightly. Gone is the grassroots, guitar-based music that the DMB has always done best, replaced by some Alanis Morrisette-sounding emo-pop (no surprise, given the new producer). After the adventuresome 'Before These Crowded Streets', I expected even further explorations in musicianship from the group. Instead, it appears that Glen Ballard inspired DMB to produce an album almost completely without substance. The group doesn't even have a keyboard player, yet from listening to 'Everyday', one would think that the band is centered around a synthesizer. Down with Ballard!"
5,Must Own This CD If You Like DMB,"All of you out there who didn't like this CD because you think Dave sold out or because the instruments are electric don't have a clue what good music is. I read this review by some guy who thinks he knows that Dave Matthews and the rest of the band are trying to appeal to select age groups with this CD. ""Everyday"" is for anyone who likes good music, because that is exactly what is on the CD. This CD is great and is definitely a must have for any DMB fan. I am a big Dave Matthews Band and I followed them around on their 2000 summer tour from Boston to Connecticut to the Carolinas and they were unbelievable. If you like their other studio releases (Crash, Under The Table and Dreaming, Before These Crowded Streets) then you will love this one, GUARANTEED! GET THIS CD!"
4,"finally, no overplaying","it's a good album. no, really. the best part, I feel, is how the band plays ""down"". what I mean by this is that they don't overplay, in particular the drummer. there isn't a fill every two seconds. it's really trimmed and straight yet not at all diminished as far as thought and creativity are concerned."
2,What happened Dave?,"Very disappointing. Starts out spunky, but fades quickly into mediocrity. Perhaps new fans may enjoy it, but those of us familiar with everything before Crash should probably avoid this. Also, I was VERY disappointed that Grey Street didn't make the cut. Shame on you Dave!"
5,What an album!,"As a Scottish person, we don't hear much of the Dave Matthews Band in Scotland so this purchase was a stab in the dark. However, it paid off. Dave Matthews combines the sound of the Counting Crows with a band that likes to rock. This album is so easy to listen to. Every song on it makes me more likely to buy the old stuff of Dave Matthews and find out where it came from. The 3 best songs on this album are ""Everyday"", ""The space between"" and ""Fool to think"". A must buy by far."
2,Glen Ballard = menace to society,"The songs themselves on this record are pretty decent. My problem is with the god awful production and final mix. Glen Ballard has away of compressing instruments into the ""wall of noise"" syndrome. Everything just blends together into sonic mush at maximum volume. It's nearly impossible to make out the saxaphone or violin here. Mix engineer Chris Lord-Alge bleeds out any dynamics, making this record sound flat, abnoxiously loud, overproduced, and just plain terible.I think Ballard and rock bands using acoustic instruments don't mix. Anyone here remember the Van Halen songs with Diamond Dave back on the greatest hits album? Listen to tracks and compare them to ones produced by Ted Templeton. Ballard ruins those tunes the same way he does Dave Matthews.Hey Glen, go back to your little girlfriend Alanis and stop destroying good bands."
3,Where's the soul?,"I'm a little disappointed with this album. It is undeniable that Dave Matthews can write lyrics. It is absolutely true that the band, as an ensemble, and as individuals, is extraordinarily talented. There is no question that this band has soul. However, this album does not reflect these characteristics nearly as well as previous albums. None of the songs are over five minutes long, I assume so they could be played on radio without being cut off. You hardly hear Boyd or LeRoi at all. Dave's singing is outstanding as usual, but it feels as if he's been muted a bit. I think the influence of Glen Ballard is significantly obvious here and I do believe it is for the worse. I'm praying their next album will strive to return to the more organic and soulful sounds of Before These Crowded Streets and Crash."
2,Weak at best,"Dave's weakest stuff to date. I played it for a week at most and haven't played it again. I am sure the songs sound great live but as far as the CD goes there is nothing here that is outstanding except maybe ""Angel."" Mediocre comes to mind as well."
3,A Satisfactory Introduction,"As an infantile fan of DMB, ""Everyday"" has been a good introduction into his realm. Aside from hearing ""I Did It"" and ""The Space Between"" on the radio from time to time, I had never given Dave any thought. But then one day I was walking down the aisle of Media Play, looking for some feel good music that I thought I could jive well too, I came across ""Everday"". I figured why not!? I had heard good things about DMB. After listening to the album I was pleasantly surprised at what I heard. The deep, rough vocals provided by Dave Matthews soothed my soul more than anything else out there on the popular music market. Recently, I have begun downloading songs from older albums of DMB and am really enjoying what I am finding. The older stuff seems to be a little bit better than ""Everyday"" provided, but it is an overall good indroduction piece. I am looking forward to buying/downloading the older albums."
4,Great album - but needs listening to a few times,Got this CD in 2001. At first it was a difficult listen - I thought I had wasted my cash again (The space between was/is good though.Then one day I put the CD in the car and forced myself to listen - well it was the only CD I had in the car and the radio was driving me nuts. By the time I was on the 3rd play I was hooked.Angel is particularly good. Now it is one of my regularCD's
1,This album makes me angry.,"I'm listening to it for the second time. I've had it for a month now. It's awful. It makes my ears bleed. I just listened to Before These Crowded Streets, by most accounts not Dave and Co.'s best album, but it was one of mine. The contrast is unbelievable. One album has music on it. The other is a collection of four minute pop songs, which wouldn't be so bad, except that there is a glaring lack of emotion from a band/artist that is best known for its emotionally captivating albums and performances. I've never cared for brand-name producers like Glen Ballard, and this is exactly why...all sonic perfection, and no heart. It's fine when he does this to Alanis Morrissette (who cares?), but for a fine musical ensemble like the DMB to succumb to his hollow ways is the most unfortunate thing to happen to music in years. Don't waste your money."
1,Forget the hype,Boy some people will buy anything. Besides the fact that DM can't sing and there are no memorable melodies on this disc some will insist that this is just wonderful. At least in the past there was some unusual instrumention and musicianship going on. This is just a stab at top 40 ala Alanis (whom Ballard also produced). 5 years from now you will be embarrassed to admit that you have this in your collection.
1,Disappointing,"Most of their tracks are not so catchy, its amazing to know a band that'll come up with a track as good as ""Satellite & Space between"" wouldnt have much more nice tracks."
1,Over exposed,"Another band gets into the spot light, signs a big record deal and pushes out the CDs, cuase the record company's gotta make their money.Shoulda known it was over with all the live albums......how much DMB do we really need?PS I tried to give this no stars, but they wouldn't let me.."
2,Ants Marching... in the Wrong Direction,"Okay, I took everyone's advice and listened to the album more than once - I've now listened to it about a dozen times. I've got news for you. It still blows.Dave - next time you have a cerebral meltdown, do us all a favour and just release another live album. We were all much happier then.In the meantime, I'll keep clicking my heels and hoping that this was all just a bad dream."
1,"""He did it"" (Sell Out)","Not to say that DMB hadn't sold out before, but I really don't know what Dave was thinking by putting out this album. His music has definitely been lacking the chemistry that he once had in the past... I don't know what DMB intended to do except sell records when he got himself a new producer famous for making hits and cut a song and video of ""I did it"" that fits perfectly into the TRL scene. If this is the way the band was starting out and wanted to get it's break and get it's music out there with a pop sound it would be almost understandable. But as is, the band was and is so accomplished to the fan base that it's mindblowing to comprehend why he would do something like this. They have dissapointed so many with this crap. I can say that DMB was my favorite band, and now I can't say I feel the same way. I just lost a lot of respect.If you wanna hear catchy music, buy it. If you don't think you'd like a TRL version of Dave don't."
1,Dave lets us down,This is a really disappointing CD. There's barely 1 track that I actually enjoy a little bit. Unlike under the table or crash the hit song [was no good]. And it's quite obvious that it was produced by Alanis Morissette's producer; it's completely different. I just didn't get the feal of all the rest of Dave's albums. That's why I give it only one star. Because compaired to all the other Dave CDs it's garbage.
3,OK a lil disapointed,This CD is OK. Its good especially I did It and Space Between. Its good 4 DMB fans and alternative/light rock listeners. If you like Dido or some kind of music like that than you should buy this. :PHey look @ my wishlist n buy me somethin lol
3,It's different that's for sure...,"The cd isn't as bad as some people say but it's definitely not a DMB album in my opinion. It really sounds more like just a Dave solo album, the tunes are more upbeat, musically and lyrically. The music isn't so bad though the jams are cut so short by Ballard's over production and though i'm not a fan of dave on the electric, it's not the main problem. the main problem is the lyrics. they don't mean anything, they're not in the same ballpark as any of his other songs. if you're a dave fan it's a cd to own, and if you aren't but you like this, listen to his other stuff and make the decision for yourself. also, if you like peter gabriel this just might be it for you...."
4,I really liked it,"I enjoy all the DMB albums and this one is no different. I liked hearing the guys take a different approach and think they hit on some very good material. It's not my favorite DMB album and some of the songs aren't very interesting... but other songs are fantastic and I hold this album as just as 'important' as any other, in its own unique way. It's a strong whole with some real nice songs and a brand new sound."
1,Second thoughts,"In March I gave this CD 3 stars, trying to be optimistic and loyal to a band I love. I realize I haven't listened to this CD since April. Why? Because I just don't like it. It didn't grow on me. I never started humming the tunes idly at work, fuggedaboudit! I hope the new tunes will be good in concert this summer(looking forward to Hartford)From what I've seen of the set lists they're playing a lot of the Everyday tunes, which I can understand. If I could pick some Everday songs for the sets I see, it would probably be So Right and Everyday. Maybe after I see some Everyday songs live, I'll change my mind."
3,"Perfectly satisfying, but not as unique as other Dave CD's","Although perfectly satisfying and an all-around solid album, Everyday fails to show the musical artistry Dave demonstrated in previous releases such as Crash and BTCS. The new electric guitar ends up sounding monotone and doesn't allow for the band to showcase their real talent. In fact, the material is entirely different than the original songs on Remember Two Things and Recently, and isn't as unique as BTCS or Live at Luther College. It sounds more like U2 and Semisonic. While this is a good album, it is too much like pop music, so I would recommend it for casual listeners but not hard-core Dave fans. Highlights are ""The Space Between,"" ""Everyday,"" and ""If I Had It All."""
4,Shiny,"A lot of people don't like this CD because it's not ""true"" to the DMB ""vision"". I've been a DMB fan for about 8 years, so I can relate. The new CD is indeed a bit slick. Still, I enjoy it. It's something I can listen to once or twice a week and still love. However, if I was forced to listen to it all day everyday (pun intended), I'd go insane. I am hoping DMB changes directions on the new CD coming out soon."
3,Definetly not the best,"DMB messed up a reputation of original music. This cd is way to pop-like. The Space Between was a hit, but it is not a good song.I used to think it was good, but then I bought other DMB cd's and compared them to Everyday. The songs were all-new. The album was hyped. But it wasn't good at all. I don't like it, but maybe you will. Buy it, I always like someone who supports Dave Matthews Band."
5,They amaze us everyday,"With the album Everyday the Dave Matthews Band has taken a leap of faith, and landed squarely on their feet. At first listen I was a bit taken back, the electric guitar and lack of Boyd in the album is a bit hard to get used to at first, but once you get past what you are expecting to hear, what you do hear is amazing. The lyrics are amazing and I think this is the best DMB album yet. I can't wait to hear them play it live. I hope this finds you feeling healthy"
2,Dave Matthews sinks into the Power Pop Of Glen Ballard,"Ok first, I'm a HUGE DMB fan. From the first notes of ""Remember Two Things"" I was hooked. This is the most disappointing album of DMB's career. My biggest question is ""Where's the Band?"" Unlike other albums,this disc focuses more on Dave's Voice than the band. I think there are maybe 3 tracks with sax on it. That's a sad state of affairs. Sure Dave hasn't had too many radio hits, but the label should have let the band continue their journey other than looking for ""Snappy, Upbeat"" Songs. So Dave please release the album that RCA made you scrap and bring Steve Lillywhite back. Or at least get a producer such as Daniel Lanois that has a more proven track record. Sure Alanis' ""Jagged Little Pill"" is a great disc, but ever hear Paula Abdul's ""Forever Your Girl"" or The Wilson Phillips album? I rest my case."
5,Buy it and listen to it EVERYDAY,"Being a hardcore Dave Matthews fan for years, the switching of producers from Lillywhite to Ballard disappointed me greatly. I didnt understand the logic behind departing from the producer that helped Dave with his unmistakable and irresistable sound. At first, this album is a little bit hard to digest. The sound is undeniably different, but the more I listened to it the more I realized that it's a musical progression, not a deviation. The same classic Dave sound is still there. If you didnt like the commercialized first single ""I Did It"", don't worry. All the rest of the tracks on the album are extremely impressive (So Right, The Space Between, Angel and Fool to Think). Buy this album... you wont be let down ... and you'll be able to sing along to some great tracks during Summer Tour 2001!"
2,Pretty much a miss,"Picked it up at Tower the other day ($9.99),because I like the DMB and now I see you can pick it up at Amazon for a $1.36.At that cheap of a price,that should pretty much clue you in that something was up.Not a very good outing(bad production).Murky.fuzzy.lacking in general fidelity.It sounds as if it were dubbed to death.Were these guys even together in the same recording studio ?DMB is a ""jam"" band, and this album just sounds as if that magical element is missing.When I listen to other DMB albums,it sounds(and feels)like everybody is having a good time.Kind of wooden and by the numbers on this one.When DMB is on ,they are as good as it gets,but when they are off...I wanted to pick up the newer DMB,but since Sony pulled the DRM incident,that album will not be on my playlist ANYTIME soon."
2,Every great band has 1 very forgettable effort,"This is the one everyone will forget about or joke about 10 years from now. I'm a BMD junkie and would find a Backstreet Boys cover by the band to be great. I was shocked to find myself disinterested in Everyday after the second listen with the exception of a couple songs. If you are a fan of DMB's music you won't like this effort. The lyrics sound very thoughtless as if they were rushed when they were composed. The music doesn't sound much like anything they've played before. It sounds like this is their producer's music and not the band's music. I've listened to this CD 3 times through and find 2 good songs, 2 ok songs, and 8 ""skip"" songs. Everyday will definately be on the bottom of a large pile of great Dave Matthews CD's I own. It'll be pulled out to listen to a paticular song or 2 but not to be played completely through."
2,Everyday is to DMB what Coda was to Zeppelin,"Although this album has a number of catchy tunes, I hope this will be a momentary departure from DMB's unique sound. While there is a little of Dave still left in ""Everyday,"" it's very disappointing that there is minimal sax and violin. Although we hear that the live versions will make up for this, I wouldn't mind having a taste of that jamming in my living room or in my truck. Decent album, but not noteworthy in comparison to past works."
2,2 words.....,"Big Disappointment. I've been a fan since the beginning, and have always had a little trouble getting accustomed to new albums. There is always something different with each new album, but it was still Dave. This is not Dave.. this is every other annoying rock band. This is the kind of garbage you hear on that one radio station that sounds like the same song playing over and over again."
1,It's terrible,"Sorry, I need to agree with the earlier review. This is just an awful album - the band has sold out. So much for the great eclectic mix of music - they are now officially commercialized pop junk."
3,it aint THAT bad!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!1,"This is not DMBs best album. It's not their worst. I am only 13 years old, so maybe no one cares about my opinion, but COME ON. ""I Did It"" and ""The Space Between"" are great songs. The rest of the songs on the album aren't awesome, but they're not that bad. I would reccomend this album to anyone who likes DMB and is willing to accept a change in their music."
3,Different Steps,"While 'Everyday' at first glance is not the same CD that 'Before These Crowded Streets' was, neither was 'Before These Crowded Streets' to 'Crash'. The Dave Matthews Band has been an evolving phenomenon since their inception. I was disappointed not to find the raw emotion of 'Before These Crowded Streets' on 'Everyday', there are no songs like 'Halloween' that really make one's blood start pumping, but the message is the same. Overall, this CD is a bit of a letdown from previous studio sessions, but fans have been spoiled by the wealth of great songs that have been put out. 'Everyday' is a solid album, but I would not recommend it to someone looking to become involved in the Dave Matthews Band experience."
2,Thumbs down with 4 minutes pithy songs,"Dave Matthews Band is far better than what this CD represents. This is such a let down compared to the bands 1998 studio release. If your a true fan, forget this album exists and buy the concert DVD that was release late last year."
2,Generic ho-hum fantasy,"Low-grade Tolkien imitation. Feeble attempt at pretending to be some sort of pre-history epic. Laughable try at coming up with fantasy languages and names. Perhaps about the same level as David Eddings, a tad better than the D&D novel factories."
4,The name says it all,"This encyclopaedia is thorough in the range of established and classic typestyles. Most contain some information as to its origin, unique qualities, and applications, making this more than just a specimen book."
5,A Great Book!,"This is a valuable reference work with the type faces very well organized. If you are interested in type face design and the history of type, this book is a must!"
3,Rosario,"I wish I could heard more spanish flamenco flavor in this album, just like in the previous ones."
2,Feather in the Wind Too Politically Correct,"I was disappointed in this book. On top of weaknesses pointed out by other reviewers..., the book's Political Correctness got predictable and boring. The heroine blames Whites for the massacre of an Indian tribe, but nothing is said about the massacres American Indians performed on each other. The heroine has a black friend and a Jewish friend and a grandfather ""Pappy"" and Mom and Dad who are simplistic caricatures. Her dog Max is almost interesting but mostly he just has to be walked at times convenient for seeing The Ghost. All in all: no edge, just bland."
4,My budgie likes!,"I picked up this ring chain when I first got my budgie. I had seen the birds at the store playing with/in it, so I thought it would be a good choice. It's not his favorite toy, but it's in the top three, whether he's swinging on or climbing through the rings, or just ringing the bell. A great pick to start out your cage."
3,Somewhat intesting movie but loses direction midway.,"This movie is an interesting but inaccurate take on the user car sales industry. The sales techniques discussed in this movie are sure to shut down any business. However, this movie has some redeeming features in terms of it being truly funny at times. I would say that the first half of this movie is quite good, the latter half which diverges from the car salesman theme is what wrecks the movie. Who needs a mini crime story inside a user car story?"
2,UGHH!!!,"I just could not get into this book. I tried repeatedly and everytime I got over one irritation, I'd read another page and get frustrated all over again. Everyone in the story changed so much and all in the beginning, too confusing. I will also pass on this series. Read at your own risk."
5,are ye all nuts,"i love this album!!! cherub rock is one of the pumpkins greatest songs and pissant is one hell of a scorching rock song. french movie theme is ok, quite light and almost belongs at the end of a move during credits. you can hear it on viephora too. as much as some fo my fellow reviewers think this is one to pass, i say this album is by far worth your $$$$$."
2,"Too long, scholarly and dense for the casual Dinesen fan","I bought this because I love the movie ""Out of Africa"" and wanted to learn more about this fascinating woman. Ms. Thurman has obviously done years of research. But I am just not interested in this level of detail and minutia about EVERY single member of Dinesen's family, every acquaintance, every meal she ate and dress she wore. I skimmed the first 100 pages or so to get to her marriage to Bror and the move to Africa. Then I found myself still skimming because there was nothing of interest that I didn't already know from the movie. Finally gave up about halfway through. Maybe it was just the wrong book for me."
1,Almost meaningless,"This book seemed meaningless to me. As others have noted, it is basically a very long sequence of rather poor line drawings and very little else. Very few low quality pictures are included; that is a pity because they could help provide some inspiration or guide your design. And fairly little know-how information is provided for do-it-yourself folks - the author recommends using professional installers. For most people, cabinet manufacturer websites and/or a visit to your local Home Depot or Lowe's kitchen design center will be much more useful than this book."
4,2nd book of the Griffin Series,This novel is the story of Zachary the youngest brother of the Griffin family. He finds himself at a house full of six unmarried daughters all trying to find themselves a husband - all but one! Caroline just wants to paint his portrait and leave the country side to study art. This historical novel has some wonderful funny moments and great love scenes. I can't for the next novel on the Griffin family.
4,braid,"braid are reuniting for a tour this summer. this album is really good. i can't wait to see them play the songs live. also get movie music vol. 1, which is probably even a little better. braid are coming back!"
5,Loved it,Loved this book. One of her best.anyone that likes a good story will love it. Very hard to put down.
3,promise unfulfilled,"I have every previous album by this band and bought it expecting something up to the level of _Year of the Dog_ or _The Half Tail._ Though not bad, it doesn't live up to its promise. The drumming is unimaginative, and the Eaglesham brothers, whose playing (I now realize) propelled the band are not in evidence. Not bad in and of itself, but not up to the precendent set by its predecessors."
2,Disappointed,"I first heard of Wolfstone when I attended a folk festival some years ago. I was very impressed by their melodic folk rock, so when I heard of their new CD ""Strange Place"" I was really looking forward to it. But after listening to the CD the first time I was very disappointed. It rather sounds like boring pop with a celtic influence, not like the lively Wolfstone tunes I expected. All in all, it's a rather poor Album, I cannot recommend it."
4,Well done Robbie!,"If you haven't heard Robbie before, this album is perhaps going to disappoint you. However if you are already a fan of Robbie and know everything about his ups and downs in his music career, you'll love it.This man has so many faces; he now comes up with an album which is kind of an experience of sorts. It is a sort of travel from evil to divine. Needless to say Robbie sounds a bit philosophical and has certainly matured not just as a singer but also as a songwriter. His association with Duffy has certainly worked wonders for him and may be this album will be the turning point of his once glorious career.As far as the songs are concerned, they are good and really good. While some songs could have been a bit more ""decent"" (in all senses of the word), I guess fans won't complain, coz this man's ultimately the ""greatest entertainer""!Most certainly a must have for all Robbie fans. You must experience the reserruction this man is undergoing!"
4,"Escapology, Volume II","First of all, the single TRIPPING is one of the best singles Robbie ever made. So we could expect a very good album, written with a new partner. Instead of that, we get a carbon-copy of his previous album, ESCAPOLOGY. It's really the same type of contemporary pop/rock music with the same old ballads he should avoid now.I hope someday he makes another SING WHEN YOU'RE WINNING type of album (his best so far - with more pop music than rock music)but for the moment Robbie has decided to stick with his rock and roll style.It seems a bit dated by moment (seems like it was recorded in the eighties)but overall this is a good album by the world's biggest pop music record-seller."
2,"Cheeky, chirpy and still over here","Stokes' favourite son belts out another hit album. Sadly there is nothing original here, just another mish-mash of pop tunes that could have been done by any X Factor wannabee. In fact it may be fair to say that Mr Williams has done very little since 'Let Me Entertain You' and perhaps now might be the time to call it a day, especially as he's struggling to get anyone in the U.S. to notice him! He obviously has talent but why he insists on releasing formulaic albums such as this one is beyond me. I've given this two stars simply for the fact the cd makes a useful coaster for my coffee mug!"
3,3rd League,"Sorry, this CD may be quite nice from a nostalgic point of view; if you are in the mood, that's o.k. If not, it sounds simply dated. The songs are rather limited. Nothing next to a real high quality Doors-type band of this time like The Fate, Sgt.Death (1969)."
3,A Solid Effort!,"To help you become a better leader as an executive, Alan Downs teaches you how to get through your fears and trust your own talents. He focuses on how to gain the confidence to be yourself. After that, your goal should be to bring passion to whatever you do. While many of these ideas will be familiar to readers of self-help literature, Downs does a good job of adding a unique spin with his examples of classic and present-day stories that illustrate long-held fears. He organizes his material in an effective, easy-to-read way and suggests that overcoming fears is only a step on the road to self-confidence. This leaves the reader with plenty to chew on, marking this book as a better than average self-help guide and earning it a recommendation in this category from us [...]."
1,Worst Company EVER to deal with!,"Unfortunately I cannot give a 0 or negative rating, since this is my worst experience ever with an online retailer!Got a defective cover. When I went to contact them, they do NOT provide a number to call (only e-mail). To date they have ignored 30+ e-mails! The one and only response, simply told me to buy another cover!I would beg you to steer clear of this company, at any cost!Furthermore, the cover is increadibly overpriced! Save your money! Buy a better cover with a company who gives a crap! (maybe directly from Cowon?)Clearly zcover does not have a bit of concern over their customers."
2,Poor Product Life Cycle,"I purchased this product with my X5L 30GB; it protects the device very well, however the thinnest part of the cover is on the back were the belt clip is mounted, this resulted in a failure in the rear area regarding the belt clip. This occurred after about 6-8 months of use."
1,"Some cancers disappear untreated, study finds","There are many people who cure (themselves) from cancer (and other diseases, for that matter). A few things they all seem to have in common:They take responsibility for their health/sickness away from doctors or anyone else.They get rid of negative feelings (like anger, grudge, helplessness and, most of all, by doing this, FEAR). In other words, they CHANGE their lifestyle (most of the time they also take control of what they eat - which is where this book comes in handy).But most important (togheter with finding peace of mind):They give their body TIME TO HEAL ITSELF![...]Hope this will be of help for a few people."
1,Dull and predictable,"If you're looking for a good ghost flick, keep looking this isn't it. The acting is subpar, the plot is uninteresting and the quality was nothing special either."
3,Cheap and good but leaves a eternal sweet taste after having it,"I have been trying various whey protein products lately and I recently order this item.This product is very reasonably priced, and mixes well with water but leaves a eternal sweet taste (kind of not very good) even hours after having it .. that part I really am not comfortable with."
5,"Mocha, mocha, mocha!","Love this cafe mocha! On a scale of 1 to 10, I will give it a 9. I use 2 TBSP of this whey protein in a blender with 6 oz of milk and 2 TBSP of a drink mix powder from Hills brothers called double mocha. I add a handful of ice and blend until really creamy. My kids and I love these ""icy mochas"".......and they are healthy...not like the one's at paneras or McDonalds. Can't say the same about my FIRST flavor,""Rich Chocolate"". I have a trainer that loves this protein brand, so I thought I would give it a try. (I love chocolate and I thought it would be my safest bet.) I thought the flavor of rich chocolate was dreadful. Many times I felt like I had to choke it down. I was determined not to throw it away and get through my 5 lb container! I don't know why, but I decided to give another flavor a try....but in a 2 lb size. To my suprise, the mocha is really good. Now I am encourage to try another flavor. What is another good flavor to try?"
1,Shoddy product with misleading item description,"When buying whey there are two notable criteria to be mindful of: no fructose, which increases insulin resistance, and no soy, which, apart from posing an allergy problem for many also contains estrogenic isoflavones (soy lecithin is a reasonable exception since it's used in minute quantities as an emulsifier, though egg lecithin would be preferable). I placed an order for the Pina Colada flavor upon reading the favorable ingredients list in Amazon's description. Surprise! It contains soybean oil. It's also not eligible for a return, despite being unopened. I feel duped and now I'm out $40. Am I going to wither into the opposite gender from eating soy? No. Should I be able to choose what I put in my body and feel confident that what I'm buying online is representative of the actual item? Hell yes."
2,Disappointing Taste,"I found the flavor of this product to be so off-putting that I didn't want to use it. Even when you open the lid, the smell of the dry powder is awful. However, my mother liked it better than the protein powder she was using, so I gave it to her. It could be just a matter of individual taste."
1,my order never receive!!!,"i make an order for this item on 6th of september with 2 days shipping, till this comment made i did not receive my package yet, and there nor respond from the seller!"
4,Whey,"Tastes good, price is fair. Comes with a scoop. This Whey makes me bloated, but not as bad as some others."
5,Best brand I've tried yet,"It appears to me that the majority of people rating fewer than 4 or 5 stars here are doing so because of the taste of this product, which is highly subjective as I found it to actually be the tastiest whey product I have tried even amongst others of this same brand (Dymatize). This is a ""pure"" protein product - no carbs, no fillers, minimal fat and cholesterol, added glutamine and other amino acids and all at a terrific price (around $36 USD at the time of this writing for the subscription). To boot, I have found that this brand digests much easier than other wheys I have used - and I have been using protein supplements on and off for about 10 years now. No gas, no bloating - makes a stomach (and those around you) happy :-)."
2,"Bearable to chug, but horrible aftertaste","For the last couple years I have been primarily sticking to ON brand proteins. That is the basis for my comparison when I say this tastes very gritty in a shaker cup, and is only slightly better when mixed with a hand blender. Now for the fact that this particular flavor (cafe mocha) really tastes like garbage. I'm actually kind of impressed that they captured the essence of garbage so well that I kind of want to raid the cats litter box to get the taste out of my mouth.I did do my research before I purchased this product. I looked here as well as many other websites, and saw mostly favorable reviews for this. If you look at bodybuilding.com they actually have people rate the taste of products on a 1-10 scale and this was receiving mostly 9s and 10s. Maybe I got a bad batch, but I will never buy this particular product again."
4,Managing human resources,"Book came in a timely manor and was in great condition, it looked just like the picture...just what I wanted"
2,History Lite -,"The author's style is a bit too casual - perhaps appeals to some but not to me. Apparently, it's important to be edgy today. The book is less like reading history and more like reading a gossipy, tell-all.Also, the author's bias permeates the book - you never have to guess which historical character he likes or dislikes. Everitt blithely impugn Caesar's (and Anthony's) sexuality, based on no real historical evidence, but it does add a salacious element.Everitt does manage to convey a good amount of information, but it is too bad that Adrian Goldsworthy hadn't written a book on Augustus."
5,Definitely 5 stars,"Everitt's writing style makes a difficult subject exceptionally readable. I like his clarity as to what are known historical facts, what are probabilities and those events which are likely rumor. This book is a page-turner."
3,Interesting but slow,"The book has a great amount of detail about Augustus' life. You will clearly understand this era of Roman history. The first part of the book with Julius Caesar and Marc Antony move quickly with interest. After Antony is killed, things slow down. In general I got out of the book what I wanted, but would have liked it to be more fast moving."
5,Amazing!,"This biography is a masterpiece, suitable for long lovers of Rome and its rulers or for those that are just courious on the life of one of the gratestest rulers ever born.Augustus: The Life of Rome's First Emperor, describes the man, but also all its sourrindings and creations. It shows how a political mastermind, a bit of luck and an ever present desire to build a better Rome mixed to frame one of the most important times of humankind. Times that are still present, wheter we know it or not, in our daily lives, in our language and in our political and law systems.I recommend this book to all of those that want an historical ride full of adventure, conspiracy and lessons for their daily lives."
5,If you fly fish this is 4u,Like anything i like to do i never have enough time its always something but when i find the time to fish i have to like what im using.

2,He went too far,Michael Crichton again writes cautionary tale about Tech (Nano-bots instead of Dinos this time) pushed too far. Predictably it lashes out and must be thwarted by the protagonist. He is writing same old plotline with the same stock cardboard characters. Still he places just enough background and science information to make it passable until the last half of the book. Then he jumps over the line of willing suspension of disbelief and is then relegated to silliness. This same book written with a more subtle hand could have been chilling. He makes nano-bots into a large visible menace. My only thought is he was trying to write the book to be a movie. It might be a great visual but it ruined the book.
2,"Makes For A Good ""B"" Movie","The first chapter or two are pretty engaging, and the theme is intriguing. But by the time the book gets to it's conclusion, it's pretty easy to see threads of Aliens, The Thing, and even B-movie Screamers running through the conclusion of this book. Although it'd make for an enjoyable horror or sci-fi B-movie, the last third of the book is pretty formulaic, and doesn't measure up to the hype of the premise, or the author behind it."
3,Conceptually interesting. Weak plot though.,"Unfortunately, Crichton's books fall into 2 categories. (1) A brilliant lesson in the chosen field (eg. nanotechnology, creating dinosaurs)and a gripping read. Or (2) a brilliant lesson in the chosen field in the absence of a real plot.Unfortunately 'Prey' falls into the latter category. I won't rehash the plot, but basically this novel suffers from information over-kill at the expense of character development and the formulation of events. Crichton's ability to cram so much difficult information into a book is simply astounding. And that he can make it so easily digestible to a wide audience is even more remarkable. However, I was left with the feeling that I had just read an interesting text book rather than a work of fiction.Not bad, but he has done better."
2,Nano Thrills,"The story was pacy and it was thrilling in parts. However, it became very predictable and I could easily stay a step ahead of the story without even trying much. I was disappointed."
2,ROBOT DANCE,"You may turn the pages, but you will not care about either the robotlike heroine or hero in this mechanical dance of a novel. The hero, if you can call him that, is more concerned with the price of diapers and feeding the baby than he is that his wife has become a stranger who slaps the baby.When the story finally progresses from shopping and changing diapers to fighting the little monsters, the plot loses all originality and becomes a cut and paste from other books and film. Sad.That this is what passes for popular bestselling fiction is a good reason not to read it."
2,"Well-written, but too predictable","Michael Crichton is one of the best popular writers today. I don't think that's debatable. That fact makes Prey all the more disappointing. In it, Crichton relies too heavily on his page-turning style of writing (similar to Harlan Coben) and abandons what made him a must-read - a plot people believe. Maybe he's a victim of his success. Regardless, the characters here are shallow and undeveloped and the ""horrifying"" nanobots are really more of a joke than a threat. Anyone could predict the end if they're paying attention in the first couple of chapters. Unfortunately, you have to read 350 or so pages to confirm that assumption."
1,A once-enjoyable writer now produces self-parodies,"Crichton's downhill slide as a writer, it could be argued, dates from the sequel to Jurassic Park. That dreadful book was obviously intended as a basis for a screenplay. Since then, Crichton seems to have been going through the motions. In ""Prey"" we're given unformed characters, an absurd plot, and -- most disappointing of all for a Crichton fan -- boring science. Is the writer getting old, or does he care only about the money? My impression is neither: He just seems bored. And so will you be, if you read this book."
1,"Good movie, bad book","The story starts out only describing one character in detail and ends the same way. This thin book reads the same, no depth. I do think that can be produced into a great movie, if they take the Crichton name and the book title, add some action and great special effects. But, as a book it was lacking in all important aspects, plot, character development and flow."
4,"A great novel, ruined by its ending","This is one of those books that can receive the cliched comment, ""Once you pick this book up, you won't want to put it down."" While this is true for most of the book, the ending becomes quite far-fetched (even for a Crichton sci-fi) and is ultimately predictable. It follows his tried-and-true formula to a fault.What I found quite pleasant was that this novel was written in the first person, giving it an interesting twist. As usual, the characters seems real, and the story comes to life.All-in-all, this is a good book, but should have had some more work done to it before its release."
2,New concept but misses the mark,This book has the trademark twists and turns you expect from Crichton but I was not impressed. He could have done better.
3,"good, but repetitive","i read this book, and thought that it was fairly dectn. my problem with it was that it kept on repeting itself. the same scenes seemed to happen again and again. now, if you have never read any of mr. crichtons books before, then you would most likely give it 4-5 stars, but it would be confused out of your mind. all those who are familiar with crichtons writing style would give this an average rating. in order to understand this book more, then read some of his other works such as ""The Andromeda Strain"", because this is one of his most comple pieces. also, ""Prey"" contains very strong language, and some disturbing scenes. my advice: get it from the library, its not worth $..."
2,Dissapointing to me,"I came to this book with high expectations from Jurassic Park, Disclosure, and Timeline (which was a better book than movie). I was dissapointed by this book, I expected it to be better than it was. It is readable, but I did not get a good feel for the characters and the storyline, while interesting on the surface, suffers from what is best described as ""limp"" telling. It just didn't grab me as most good books do. I can't say that it will do the same for you, but this is my opinion."
4,Good Scary,"Another Scary story by the master of make believe, with just a shread of possibility.I liked the fast movement of the story and the way I pictured the layout in my mind. I could all but hear the sound of the swarms and the danger of the characters in the warehouse."
3,"A fun plot, but the writing style is kind of wooden","I read this novel because my son read it and like it. The plot is clever, and has some interesting science, but the writing style is labored and not very elegant"
2,It takes years of practice to write this bad....,"I love Michael Crichton books. I mean, who doesn't right? This book is not up to par at all compared to his other works. I felt like this book had an excellent premise and could have gone the distance. The beginning was very good and I thought it had promise. All of a sudden, when you get about half way through chapter two, you come to realize your error. This book is just cheesy. If I wanted to watch b flicks on the Syfy channel I would be doing that instead of reading a book. It is hard to believe this is out of the same mind that brought us such books as Jurassic Park and Congo. I might have to start reading the book previews before buying if this becomes a pattern. UGH."
4,A book not unlike a spell,"What makes a book great IMO is when the story keeps you so completely hooked, you are unable to put it down until you've finally finished it in the wee hours of the morning. Prey met that criteria for me. Sure it wasn't perfect. The store became increasingly implausible and fantastic, some of the characters nothing but props, and I sure didn't like how they got ""rid"" of his wife so he could end up with the Luan (or whatever her name was) - hence 4, rather than 5 stars. Nevertheless, a fantastic read. I highly recommend it."
2,Inaccuracies in the text.,"Michael Crichton's book contains two errors. On page 42 in the large print edition it is stated: ""We entered a vein, so the red cells are not oxygenated."" The pulmonary veins contain oxygenated blood. Not all veins are low in oxygen. Also, on the same page it is written: ""We're coming to the right atrium, and we should see the mitral valve."" Correction: The mitral valve is located between the Left Atrium and the Left Ventricle."
3,frustrating rehash...,"a shame. i had great hopes for this book, the possibilities for the story were endless...and all he did was make ""prey"" a nano-tech version of his ""jurassic park"" he wrote more than 10 years ago (replacing the ""smart"" raptors for the ""smart"" nanobots), or even worse, the cheesy ""tremors."" and, as a few reviewers noted, even ""star trek-tng"" did this exact same storyline, sans the wife's-maybe-cheating subplot, thankfully.really frustrating to see one of my favorite authors crash and burn like this. but i can't give ""prey"" 1 star - his pacing and his dialogue is still many levels above other ""action"" authors who continue to dump out a book each year. that alone is worth 3 stars. i just wished it was more..."
3,watch for the movie,"While not an example of Crichton's best work, this one is still an enjoyable read.The theme is already a bit over-done: technology gone awry in the hands of unscrupulous techno-masters, but this one appears to be destined for a movie contract."
3,Not his best,"The story's okay; not bad, not great either, definitely not his best. It starts slowly, graduates in the second third, and then it keeps the pace till the end, which doesn't bring any big surprises though; not for an observant reader anyway. The author made several mistakes when explaining software related topics. For example, the passage about recursive algorithms is not exactly correct, and the one code example he used is so bad it made me think Crichton's software advisor had to work for Apple, part-time at least.The book reads more like a movie script than a novel. I think there's a great movie potential in this book. Actually, this could be the first movie based on a Crichton's novel that could be better then the original. I hope so.Don't let these negative comments of mine to dissuade you from reading this novel. It's still a Michael Crichton, after all. Chances are if you liked his other novels you will probably enjoy Prey as well."
3,Not his best work,"I wasn't terribly impressed with Crichton's latest offering. While I read the Andromeda Strain cover to cover in one setting, I found Prey to be a whole lot of hype with very little payoff."
1,Nano-Wordprocessors,"I think Michael Crichton would like to have swarms of Nano-Wordprocessors churn out his books for him. They could search the world's encyclopedia's and randomly pick subjects for books, much the way he does now, except faster. Note to aspiring writers - before you sit down and write that novel you've dreamed of, check with the Crichton Book Factory, he's probably beat you to it."
4,"Artificial intelligence, evolution, and nanotech","Indeed it is a scary thought: killer nanoparticles that swarm and devour anybody in its path. The novel is about nanotechnology, but it deals also with the evolution of atom-sized robots and the computer intelligence that drives them. The word ""Prey"", which the book is titled, refers to the program that gives the killer swarm its instructions.It is a really good read. Crichton has a way of weaving together science fiction and the terrifying consequences of science's alleged misuse into a really good story.If you are totally new to nanotechnology, ""Prey"" is a good, albeit fictitious, introduction.Another winner from Michael Crichton."
4,Prey,An excellent sci-fi that holds your attention. I wonder why this book hasn't been made into a movie...
3,plot advances only in nano-increments,"I had only read one other Crichton novel, Sphere, which I did not enjoy very much, but I thought I'd give MC another chance. While I enjoyed Prey much more, it was far from thrilling. It was entertaining and chock full of well-researched info, but the snails pace was a downer. Jacks adventures in house hubbying was not why I was reading the book. Also, his ignorance of his wifes behavior was totally unbelievable. It was clear what was going on to the reader, but no matter how burdened Jack was by his domestic demands, he could surely have put two and two together. I overlooked this recurring flaw and pressed on, and was relieved as the plot eventually picked up some steam and ended well. The main thing I got from this book is that I will never read Crichton again. I'll just watch the movies."
3,A high school kid could have written this,"The science behind this is really interesting. It makes my mind soar considering all the possibilities that the technology discussed in this book evokes.However, the plot was predictable, except for a few silly surprises that seemed to have no relationship with the rest of the story - like one of the characters has a car accident for no particular reason.The relationship of the husband and wife depicted in this story is thin, predictable, and boring.Overall the book has a cool premise and a silly plot."
2,The Author 'worked' hard on this one,"Crichton labored through this novel. He seems to relate well to the hero of the tale Jack Forman (Foreman?? One who supervises work. The way Crichton does here)A good Crichton novel is one in which you can tell he is in love/fascination with the subject matter. I get the feeling he was somewhat interested in this and had to get a book out the door after his last ""Travel Guide."" Its good, don't get me wrong. But compared to Rising Sun, Timeline, or the Great Train Robbery, Prey comes off as work...hard work. The story has a lot of build up and seems to end abruptly. Just because he gets together a voluminous amount of information...doesn't mean it swarms together with some sort of collective intelligence and creates a great story. Just like in his ""Swarm"" emotion or lack there of counts for a lot."
2,Just couldn't get into it.,"I really enjoy most of M.C.'s works, but I just couldn't get into this book. It definately presents some interesting theories but I found myself disconnected from the story."
2,Preposterous failure of imagination,"The subject is fascinating and I believe Crichton is right in fearing the technology may go terribly wrong in the future. But I was ultimately unable to suspend disbelief in the last quarter of the book when Crichton totally left the realm of the possible and indulged, for wont of honest imagination, in utter fantasy.His bot swarm development and activity make anything in ""Jurassic Park"" seem like the hardest of proven science by comparison, and it was far-fetched and belied a half-baked understanding of the biologically possible.I was terminally disenthralled with this book and with Crichton as a serious writer. My respect for his work has been badly shaken by his indulgence in fantasy to make this novel work. It was JUST TOO MUCH!Please, somebody, do this subject justice and produce a credible work of future fiction. Crichton has badly failed the subject."
3,Simple Review,"I'll keep this simple: The journey is much more interesting then the destination. This book has a facinating premise, more character development then the average Crichton novel, and is facinating for the first 400 pages. However, the climax of the novel, is a letdown. Chichton seems so intent on ""blowing us away"" that he opts for a silly, cheap plot twist that is telegraphed in the first 50 pages (I kept hoping Crichton was teasing and had something more interesting planned). I like the book; I just wish that it had lived up to the promise of the first half of the novel."
3,Believe the hype,"A little slow getting started, like a roller coaster, then hang on. Get in line for your movie tickets. A fast, educational thrill ride."
3,Blended Score,"If your going to try an read this book, I would give it a 2. But as a book on tape it's a 4. Why the difference, it's easy I would never read through ALL the explanations of the technilogy, but listening to it on tape requires no thought. It just sort of flows.Interesting story. Main character is a bit card board, but in all well worth the LISTENING to."
2,Better Get Your PHD Before Reading This One,"I read Jurrasic Park with great enthusiasm. I'm no scientific genius but I could easily follow the science in the plot, which made the book very enjoyable. Not so with this one. The science in the beginning seems like it could be comprehensible to a knowledgable person. However as the novel goes on, it begins to wheel completely out of control, and in the concluding sections just gives way to slam-bang action. Mr Crichton seems to have no consideration for the familiarity of the reader with the scientific aspect of this story. A dissapointment to me."
1,Don't feel threatened.,"Horror and suspense authors can relax; this book just did not instill fear the way one would expect from author Michael Crichton. It is difficult to feel the sense of reality that is so necessary for a good suspense novel, as tiny nanoparticles of some experiment escape from a quiet lab in the Nevada Desert. These nanoparticles take on life like qualities and chase people around sucking the life out of them. Continually evolving, they change both shape and Modus Operandi with every turn of the page, leaving the reader not quite willing to submit to the usual spine tingler. I read this book in 2 days and could have read it in one if I had pushed it, but it just bored me. I also had the ""twist"" figured out long before the ending."
4,Anthropophagous......feeding on human flesh,"Creighton's, ""Prey,"" is an intriguing and suspenseful novel with a technological edge that will keep you riveted throughout the book. The storyline is represented by nanotechnology (micro-robots) with a shrewd adeptness to form anthropomorphically in subterfuge and to exploit its code-enhanced erudition through artificial-distributed intelligence.The main characters are developed entirely with a rich plot surrounded by a scientific experiment that goes awry. ""Prey"" is a great title for this book, as the nanotechnology gains life through its `realistic' experiences as a hunter and hunted.I would recommend this book. It is an easy-to-read, captivating, and mind-provoking novel."
5,Two Thumbs Up!!!!!!,"Michael Crichton did his best when he wrote this one. Jack Forman is a software engineer, currently unemployed. He quickly get stuck right into his wife's world when he's hired to Xymos Tech's desert facility. I can't tell you any more, it'd give too much away. But this book is worth the money. It's like a combo of sci fi/thriller/horror/great human relasionship book all rolled into one. If you liked Crichton's other books, you'll love this one!!! I think anyone who's old enough to understand some of it will totaly love it. One word of caution: not for younger children, hard to understand in vocabulary. Also, some language is inappropriate. However, anyone who can read well will enjoy it and totaly love it!!!! GET THIS BOOK!!!!!"
2,Disappointing.,"The science is wrong, the contrived humanization is unbelievably tedious, and the characters are stale. Michael Crichton shows once again how little he knows about yet another branch of science, and how, in his ignorance, his approach is one of fear and paranoia. Hooray."
4,Nano Technology is Cool,The book makes one shudder at the thought of Nano Technology. Even though this is a cool technology that will make our lives far more eventful... rather like living in Star Trek era....Mr. Chichton used his suspense to the ultimate limit in this book and makes it quite difficult to put the book down. He has a knack to discuss and explain high end technologies in simple and easy terms that are easily comprehensible by an average joe ...I cannot wait for his next title to come out ....
4,Unknown Treasure,"I'm surprised this story hasn't been turned into a movie....yet.The story is incredibly interesting. The concept is chilling and looming.On a scale from one to ten on readability it would get a nine. It was tedious at times.The style of writing make this book suspenseful, however, I found the characters to be horribly boring. I can't remember what any of the characters looked like, and I didn't feel anything for them at any point while reading this book.Also this book was not inspiring - but then again, I doubt a fast-read would be. I didn't remember any ideas from this book. In fact, I soon forgot about this book. It's a fun ride while you are on, but looking back, it wasn't very fruitful."
4,Nanoscare,"Red Herring magazine predicted a nanotech backlash as a top ten trend for 2003. Allusions were made to Jurassic Park, and its associated scare. Why not visit Foresight Institute's website, and their guidelines for safe development of nanotech/nanoscale science? David Forrest wrote some guidelines back in 1988 and is associated with IMM. Why throw away the upside? Work to limit the downside and maximize the upside. Enjoy the book, inform yourself with Foresight's mission, and try and limit Red Herring's prediction. Have fun, because its going to be a rather long haul to robust commercializtion."
2,One of the worst Crichton's I've read,"The Premise of this book is very tempting, When we move into new technology (Nanotechnology) we believe that we are in total control of these developing technologies and that nothing can go wrong. Yet many times some thing does, some time with a disastrous outcome.With this book how ever Mr. Crichton goes to great pains to make sure that even the simplest reader will easily be able to predict the ending. He does this so often that it becomes obvious that there is a suprise ending comming straight out of left field.It seams that Mr. Crichton was rushed on this book and just wanted to get it done."
1,Totally Implausible Drivel,This plot was so far off the beaten path that not even the writing skills of Michael Crichton could make it work for me. As a follow-on to novels like Jurassic Park and The Andromeda Strain this book was a huge disappointment with a plot as elusive as the nanobot cloud it attempts to captivate the reader with. I would recommend waiting until it is available at the library; don't waste your money.
2,Recipe for a Chrichton thriller,"Ingredients:Pioneering scientist on the cutting edge.Potential for big profits on new technology.Combine ingredients. Apply nature's surprising complexity, complete with many interesting but preachy tangents. When things begin to go horribly wrong, mix in male protagonist with scientific background and high virtue.After 350 pages, a few characters will be killed off but the hero will escape in a helicopter after eradicating the man-made atrocity."
2,Too political,"I've watched other Katt Williams shows and enjoyed them, even though the language is ""rough"". This one was not as interesting to me."
3,"Not Really Bad, But Could've Been Better...","...while I certainly wouldn't give this one (1) star, I don't think it deserved a five (5) star rating either. Kat Williams is funny. Don't get it twisted but, knowing what I do know he (and Mike Epps who like a lot) just need more experience as far as stand-up routines go. Both of these cat's have to talent to push the boundaries of black comedy even further. I'd love to see that. Unfortunately, too many newer comics have simply recycled old cliche's and updated older jokes from the 80's and 90's. Peace."
5,THE HOTTEST MAN IN COMEDY,"This KATT, lol, is on fire... He is HILLARIOUS and his calm demeanor is extremely appealing... He has a very unique comedy style, EFFORTLESS!!!! He pulls laugh after laugh after laugh... It's hard to REVIEW comedians b/c everyone has a different take on what ""FUNNY"" is but I'll say this - if this KATT does not make you LAUGH - U are not ALIVE ON THE INSIDE!!! Cuz anyone who's breathing will find laughs in his comedy style and content... and PIMP-INSPIRED Style and Attitude!! Very much a man made to make others laugh and he blazes the show from BEGINNING TO END - NO FILLER JOKES!!! even the simplest things said by him, are 10 times as funny as they would be coming from someone else.... So - if U wanna gather around, w/some friends, have some drinks, chill and have a REAL GOOD time - A Night AIN'T a Nite without a Katt Williams Invite!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!"
1,Never got it...,"I ordered this from a site linked to amazon, paid for it and everything and it was never sent to me."
1,Worthless presentation of a great film!,"I consider Charley Varrick Don Siegel's masterpiece and one of the very bestAmerican films of the '70s (and that's saying something), but Universal'spathetic DVD release is an utter insult to the film and its fans.I have written Universal to complain, and urge others to do the same.Needless to say, I will not be purchasing."
4,"""With God as my waitress,"" this is a laugh-out-loud funny season!","Season 5 starts with a special two-part crossover, featuring Ron Howard and Henry Winkler from Happy Days. These laughs are followed with numerous other memorable episodes, including ""You're in the Army Now,"" a two-parter guest starring Vicki Lawrence as an obnoxious sargeant when the girls are forced to leave Shotz and decide the Army might be a career option. There's also the annual Shotz Talent Show episode, full of bizarre talents, and of course, Squiggy's malapropisms, as when he dubs the Civil War ""Silverware.""Not all episodes are slapstick and fun, however. Several are more poignant, tackling deeper issues, such as ""What Do You Do With a Drunken Sailor"" where Shirley is forced to confront the fact that her beloved older brother is an alcoholic. There's also ""The Wedding,"" where the girls' landlord Edna Babish marries Laverne's father Frank.For guaranteed laughs, don't miss this DVD set!"
3,This season lacked alot of appeal and reality of the first three seasons,I am sorry but this was the worst season of Laverne and Shirley ever. There were so many boring episodes its was not even funny.The slapstick is really getting ridiculous.The cross over Happy Days episode was the worst quality you could put on dvd very washed out and fade colors.The Fonze and Richie in a cow suit please and the stupid fight scenes were dumb.This will be the last l and S dvd I will buy up to season four is fun but after that its just repetitious and childish.I found my self fast forwarding most of these boring episodes.
2,Wouldn't buy again,"I've been using this seat since my 8 month old was born and can't stand it. He's small so he's still got a few pounds to go until we move him to a bigger seat. I can't wait! The handle gets stuck on the sunshade every time you move it up or down. The handle release is akward and very hard to squeeze. The buckle is also very akward to get buckled especially with a squirmy baby (although I suppose any seat is hard to buckle when they're squirming). You have to fit together two small pieces and get them simultaneously clipped into the buckle. It's not easy. The only pros...I do like the triangular handle, it gives you many carrying options, nice fabric, and the built in level. Also it has gotten good safety reviews. In retrospect, we should've gone with the Graco Snugride. Easier to use, a little cheaper, and got equal or better saftey ratings. If we decide to have another baby, we definitely won't be using this seat."
2,handle,"I have 3 kids and I got this car seat for my youngest, cause it was cute. Overall, it is good, nice fabric, easy to clean, and it is pretty light compared to others. The latches on the handle to release it are very difficult to push. If you pull muscles easy, like I do, I do not recommend it. It is seriously very stiff, even my friends pointed that out right away. And also the straps that hold baby in seat are rather short so it does not last the first years, I had to get a new one when my daughter was 6 months old, she would not fit in it with a sweatshirt or jacket on."
5,Making Wild Wines and Meads,"Very informative. Gives step by step instructions for wines, meads, wine coolers and wine punches. Well worth having."
5,Making Wild Wines and Meads,this book was like brand new for a fraction of the cost. In the future I will consider using the same customer. Also I was pleased with shipping of the book. Cheap and fast enough.
4,Marijuana inc: Inside America's Pot Industry,"I think this is a very interesting book on America's Pot Industry in the USA. It tells all about it,"
3,Pretty good radio,I received one of these as a Christmas gift. The sound is good. The things I do not like about it are that the presets are erased if you unplug the radio and the remote does not have a volume control. I use this radio outside when I work in the yard or if I am working out which makes the remote volume control more important to me. It's a great radio if you have no plans to move it from where it sits.
2,Depends on what you are looking for...,"It is true that these boards come warped from the factory - concave on the cutting side. I found that heating up the board on the cutting side with hot running water makes it expand and actually invert the warp, but it switches back when cooled. Probably due to the different parts being fused together to make the single board. This makes cutting difficult in two ways:1) with a concave cutting surface, long flat knives (such as slicers or bread knives) won't cut all the way through to the board in the middle2) The non-slip surface is only touching in the center, and the board pivots easily on the counter topAdditionally, the board does cut very easily with sharp knives, and it appears impossible to get food staining out of the cuts.Bright side is that placing in the dishwasher doesn't make the warping any worse."
4,oem,great all around tire with foam inserts included. product was perfect but the install sucked. tires held up the first time til i hit metal on the tire.
3,A familiar lullaby,"Nothing chaps my hide like reviewers who spend more time insulting other people's opinions than reviewing the book or challenging the specific points the person brought up. So I won't be one. I didn't hate this book like some did. I didn't love it, either, probably because I read this Harlequin Intrique before. First when it was called WINTER'S EDGE by Anne Stuart in number 329. Then it was called THE OTHER LAURA by Sheryl Lynn in number 367. A woman is in a car ""accident."" She loses her memory, can't remember her husband and somebody wants to kill her. Pretty much the same idea. Only the minor details changed. I only noticed cause I bought a bunch of Intriques at a book sale a couple months ago, and those were in it. I could have been bored with the story by the third time, but I don't this book was as good as those. Sexy heroes. Big surprises. Heart-pounding romance. None of those here. Anyone who wants to read this story should find those books. They were better than this one."
2,Difficult reading for the amount of information,"I am a big fan of Ralph Kimball's data warehouse books. I was looking for a similar book for operational data stores, and had hoped this would be it. I was disappointed. There is a good bit of information in this book, but it is not written with the clarity of Kimball's books. The biggest disappointment though is the lack of real examples of ODS data models. I expect examples to be less ""definitive"" for an ODS than for a DW, nevertheless I desire something more tangible than what is presented in this book."
5,Hedonism in Jamaica has some sexy girls in this video.,"I read some Amazon.com reviews of this video, and I had to have it when I saw Eurasian sexpots Kat Oberle and Genevieve Michelle (Gurchak) were on it. They don't disappoint me in it, and some other girls are sexy too, e.g. Monica Mendes. Overall, this is one of the sexiest ""Playboy Videos"" I have seen, so it is a Must Have for me."
4,Good CD,Sheila Chandra is a good artist that hasn't got her due. Her vocal skills are comparable to Enya and yet she is nowhere to be found on the airwaves...even on world music and alternative stations.This is a good CD but I liked her other CDs like Quiet and Zen Kiss better.
2,Abysmal Transfer,"The reviews of the actual movies have already been mentioned by other reviewers. I just wanted to mentioned that you definitely will not be seeing any of these movies on TCM (Turner Classic Movies), UNLESS the film and transfer quality has been worked over by the wizards that digitally improve the quality. As they stand now in this boxed set the quality of the films and the transfer of the films many times is abysmal. I would strongly advise renting this from your local library rather than putting out hard earned cash for these movies. And, yes, Robert Mitchum is in one of these movies, but it is such bad quality and he is in it so infrequently that it is a shame."
2,poor video quality,"A lousy picture on most of the movies. Not remastered or enhanced. With my 65"" it was just a blury mess and certainly not worth anything to anyone. It looked like an old old silent movie!"
2,"Blab, Blab, Blab","The movie selections included in this collection are OK, but over all disapointing. Information that was provided regarding the actual content was vague. One movie listed on the box was not included in the movies sent. The picture on the box shown on this review does not match the box I ordered."
4,A practical book,"The sub-title 'A tourist guide' describes exactly what this is. It's very practical, with information on what clothes to take, how to rent a car, tipping, visas, places of interest and places to stay. I've not (yet) been to Eritrea, but there is plenty of useful information here plus a little general background on history and culture."
4,Love it. WAY better than more expensive ones...,"I had the Eddie Bauer ITS Travel System - Laurelhurst and returned it because the carseat base was unsafe. (read the reviews on that!!) Anyway the base on this one rules!! Its easy to put the seat in and out. Also the stroller is great. I read reviews that said the sunshade gets loose and stuff... (on the other model with different colors) but- I say ""so what?"" to that. (It has not happened to me, but this is such a SAFE seat-- take the sunvisor off if it annoys you!)I really love the system. Oh yeah, and the killer was it was 70$ LESS than the travel system I returned. Yahoo!"
2,A Hot Mess!!,"Laaawwwwdd, what was that I just watched. All that money Master P has and he has to release this low budget movie. The acting was atrocious to no end. Why don't Silkk the Shocker just give up on acting all together as long with his rap game.The two stars were given because the story was good, but the acting just didn't do its justice.I think Master P should know better!!!Later!!!!"
1,You've got to be kidding!!!,"The first Bout It, for a low budget movie was outstanding and innovative. It was gritty and poignantly real. In the Still Bout It, I don't know what the H@*L they were doing. The movie was simply atrocious! I was so disappointed in the movie that I wanted to throw it out of a window. I am a big supporter of Master P and the No Limit family however, he needs to stick to music or come real next time on the movie tip. Don't waste your money!"
3,"Ok, but certainly not sturdy","We bought this door so we could put the litter box in the garage to keep it out of reach of our puppy. It worked for the past year or so, and the dogs also love to put their heads through to see us leaving and coming home. It worked well for our purpose, except after about 8 months of heavy daily use, the magnetic strip that keeps the door from flapping broke clean off and the 4-way lock quickly jammed. We don't us it, so it's no big deal, but the door swinging back and forth sure is annoying!Also large cat breeds like Maine Coons may have some trouble with this. Our cats are large DSHs and have a hard time squeezing through. In the beginning this led to some difficulty to teaching them to use it."
2,Maybe next time,"I don't understand how anyone could like this book. The best thing about it -- the hard-boiled atmosphere -- seems derived from all the obvious sources (Hammett, Ellroy, etc). Its loaded with cliches about the Irish and Irish Americans. It reads more like a comic book than a novel. Has American crime fiction really gotten this bad?"
5,A great soundtrack,This soundtrack is wonderful - filled with older music that mostly has long been forgotten. I would recommend it to anyone who appreciates all genres of music.
1,A scooby-Doo fan!,"I bought this video to complete my Scooby Doo collection, but I should never have bouhgt it.Theres only about 20 minutes showing Scooby and Shaggy the rest of the Movie is just plain boring."
1,Poorly written...not the usual witty humor,"I bought this thinking my 5yo son would love it, as he loves all things Scooby Doo. Well, Scooby and Shaggy are in it, but not very much. Also the Arabian characters all sounded American, and the khalif was a whiny little white boy with glasses...who thought that was appropriate??? And after watching 20 minutes and seeing none of the rest of the gang, no mysteries or puzzles to solve, my 5yo asked to turn it off. That was a first. And I had to agree with him...this movie is just plain boring, and certainly not respectful of the culture."
5,interesting,"has a lot of great information, despite it being loaded with people ive never hear of. it does a great job of following the monarchs through time and giving a few details for each."
1,falling apart,"Easy to put together, but one of the screws broke and after multiple calls and emails, I still can't get a replacement screw. With just the one screw missing, the bench is constantly falling apart and is completely unsafe around children. I wish I never bought this!"
4,Good book,"This play is interesting, especially if you've read Hamlet. It is confusing at times, and sometimes difficult to follow the plot action, but it's a good read."
4,Rosencrantz & Gildenstern Are Dead,"Great piece of writing, especially since it borrows characters from the greatest playwright in English literature. Shakespeare's characters fare marginally better under Stoppard's pen, or possibly more so when you consider that the guys are DEAD!!!"
4,Charming,"I bought this after reading Hamlet at school. I am a weird one and I developed an obsession for rosencrantz and guildenstern so you can imagine how thrilled I was to get this book. However, it resembles Waiting for Godot a LOT, and Waiting for Godot is the superior of the two, so if you only want one Theater of the Absurd, go for Godot...unless you have an unexplainable R & G obssesion like me! Lol."
1,Doesn't Play,Video doesn't play on my Sony tv. Never had a problem before with any other rentals. Amazon policy is no refunds on digital rentals. Nice customer service. :(
3,may be okay for beginners but...,"The borders on every page are wide sometimes 2 1/2 to 3 inches top bottom and sides, big empty spaces, the instruction photos are huge; some photos are so big they're inadequate to show you what the end item looks like. Seems to me the book is full of ""fluff"". If it had normal borders and normal sized adequate photos the book would be half the size."
2,Code Name: Blondie,"Have enjoyed all of Christina Skyes books, this one just not as good. Maybe it was just me but the story line was just not there for me. Everything happens in a very short 48 hours."
3,Fraternity Humor,"The humor is cras and crude, but eveything is well done. All of the actors do an excellent job -- several local to the area."
5,This book is a GREAT parenting tool!!!,I highly value this book and feel it's not only been helpful within my own home but also recommend this book to my clients. This book provides very meaningful and memorable ways to interact with and to teach your child. I recommend this book most highly!
1,Don't believe the hype,"I was so disappointed in this book after reading the reviews. The characters were so ""boring"" and so not exciting. The storyline was really predictable and so obvious. This was a boring read."
2,Found myself skimming...,"I've read several Suzanne Enoch books -- this is not one of her best. I was just kind of bored with it. The main characters were likeable enough, but the story never really draws you in, and after a while it gets rather tedious. Try reading Dare's story in ""The Rake"" and the other two ""Lessons in Love"" books by Enoch for a much better respresentation of her writing."
5,Bolly-bolly-bolly,"As a fan of both Jane Austen novels and Bollywood films, I adored the film ""Bride and Prejudice."" The music from this film is delightful, carrying me cheerfully through rush hour traffic. The percussive nature of the music sticks in the mind long after the music stops playing. ""No life, without wife... oh yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah..."""
5,Hilarious Creovation,"This book is so true to corporate life. Martin Lukes is an egotistical suck up working for a bunch of the same. I love the way the author manages to characterize using a few short words in an email. For example we know Keri Tartt only from Martin's emails until the very end. When Ms. Kellaway shares with us the farewell and thank you email from Keri to her coworkers, we learn that--as we suspected--Ms. Tartt is not the very special love goddess of Martin's dreams, but is actually an airheaded bit of fluff.I love this book and I highly recommend it, especially to those in corporations everywhere who simply don't get the humor. Read it. Read it again. And if you still don't get it, take a good look at yourself in the mirror and be careful you don't lose your Blackberry."
5,Music at Matt Molloy's,"This is a great album for anyone who enjoys celtic, irish, bluegrassy, or something similar. I heard about it from a friend who loves celtic music. It is a live recording done at Matt Molloy's pub in Dublin. Good quality music all around, especially the amazing irish flute playing of Matt himself. There's a good mix of energetic and also slow, more mellow songs which give the album a well rounded appeal. I also recommend John Whelan's ""Celtic Fire"", Lunasa's ""the merry sisters of fate"", Solas's ""Sunny spells and scattered showers"", and the Chieftains' ""boil the breakfast early""."
3,Young Katherine as a Queen,"This is not Hepburn's finest film, nor is it the best Queen Mary movie. However, it does feature one of Hollywood's strongest women playing the part of one of history's strongest queens. This match makes an otherwise ordinary costume drama a must-see."
1,Not as pictures and RUSTED!,"I received the knives and they arrived RUSTED in the package. They are also flimsy and very thin. To top it off, the picture shown is NOT the picture of the actual item. The actual knives are SERRATED, not the flat blade that the picture shows. I'm retuning these and buying what the actual picture is for, for the Chicago Cutlery FORUM steak knives."
5,Beautiful,"This cd is so beautiful, as in the title of this review. The atmospheres that Bill Frisell creates is amazing. And it's so innovative combining the country lap steel with the horns. I would say this is a must-have in your collection because it adds another dimension to it. If your still not sure, Down Beat gave it 5 stars too, i think."
4,Does what its supposed to do,"Does what its supposed to do; I use this primarily as insurance for my prized Panny 54"" flatscreen. I think that the picture has improved a little since I hooked it up, but the improvement is small. I'll upgrade to a better unit later on."
3,Not Labled Right!,"I bought this set for my daughter. The actual product plays well, but It is only the first season. I've done some research and found that a lot of the episodes that I remember were in the second season. The one I was most interested in was when they went to Shangrila(not sure how to spell it). I figured that they would be in season three, which starts with The Stingers and goes to A Father Should Be where they find Ba Nee's father and he takes her home, the end of the whole series. I should have saved time by buying the whole series in one purchase."
5,"Watch out Barbie, cuz' Jem is here to stay!","Jem has always been my all-time favourite cartoon series.Powerpuff girls and Kim Possible can't even hold a candle next to the outrageous Jem and the Holograms!This DVD set has everthing you could ever ask for! Exclusive interviews with Christy Marx (the creator of Jem!), Samantha Newark (voice of Jem!), excerpts from the Jem Bible (a must read for all die-hard Jem fans!) and even a special 'play songs' feature, where you can keep on playing the Jem videos whenever you like! Wooohooo!The Jem episodes from this DVD which I highly recommend are:~Starbright - 1 - Falling Star~Starbright - 2 - Colliding Star~ Starbright - 3 - Rising Star~In Search of the Stolen Album~Glitter 'N Gold~Hot Time in Hawaii"
5,this is so truly outrageos,I am 14 years old and the first time I watched jem I was about 5 or 6 years old my mom bought a jem video for me when we were grocery shopping it had 2 episodes culture clash and race at the indie 500 I know what you jem fans are thinkin those two shows are like 5 episodes apart (...) well anyways I am just showin all you older jem fans that this generation does appraise the 80's galore and that I am probably going to buy this today because I have never seen any other episodes besides the ones I have I so can't wait to get this.
1,WHAT? JEM IS OUT ON DVD!,"Right now I'm really getting annoyed. Fair enough this DVD is probobaly worth more than one star, but I'm not going to buy it.What are all you companies playing at. There were so many 80's cartoons, and so many of them were better than this. Get Captain N out, get Thundercats out, get the original Ninja Turtles out, get the original Inspector Gadget out, get Wowser out, get Galaxy High out, get Sharky and George out, get The Real Ghostbusters out!There are a whole bunch more that deserve a DVD release far more than Jem does, so what are you waiting for.If you agree with me then please click yes rather than just passing by, that way the DVD companies might wake up and start releasing the good stuff.P.SNo offence to all those Jem fans out there. I like Jem, It's just that there are so many better 80's cartoons out there that I am itching to get hold of."
4,Please read!,"I have been a HUGE fan of Jem since i was a little girl and that was 23 years ago. I taped the episodes off tv when they first aired but alas the quality wasnt very good, so i was really excited when i found out that it was coming to DVD (the videos are difficult to locate in themselves) But i was amazed at the somewhat steep price listed to buy these products. I found both Jem season 1 & 2 as well as Jem season 3 at Best buy for considerably less than what this site is offering. So while i respect amazon.ca and HMV.. i would urge poor students like myself to shop around first. Thanks and i hope this helps."
4,Great workbook and resource!,"I was looking for a science workbook that: provided a lot of hands on activities, quality worksheets, and covered a variety of age appropriate science topics. This book provided exactly that. If you are looking for a textbook, then this is not for you, but if you are looking for a good scope and sequence for a 5th/6th grade science curriculum, and want quality information and worksheets that springboard into opportunities to learn more about the topics through additional resources (library books,) then this is absolutely worth every penny. I love it, it is exactly what I was looking for."
4,Great stand a lone book for home schoolers,This is a great stand a lone book for homeschooling families. It is affordable and full of great information. I did add to it by visiting websites and the library.
1,33 minutes - - Not worth it - -,It's advertised as 210 minutes recording and its the worst playback I have heard (in LP mode). I uploaded the recording to my computer and realized I have just wasted [my money]. SP mode is no better. I could not hear the teacher speak on playback and I think it would have worked if I literally put the mic to his face (sat in front of the class buy the way). In HQ mode I have tested and works great but only 33 minutes of recording. Horrible. .. . STAY AWAY!!!
1,Extremely poor service,"The ""stop"" button failed after about two months of moderate use; I took it to the indicated repair place, they took 3 weeks to decide they couldn't fix it, gave me an address to ship it to for warranty repair, two months later Panasonic said they could fix it for nearly the price of the unit. I wrote back pointing out that it was under warranty, they didn't respond, just shipped back the broken unit.I'll never buy from Panasonic again.The device was okay while it worked. Of course the ""LP"" mode is completely unusable, apparently true for most devices of this class (why do they bother?)."
2,Just an advertisement for Hulk merchandise,"Whereas the other Marvel Encyclopedias act like updated versions of the old Handbook to the Marvel Universe and gives entries about the different characters of the Marvel Universe, this book is more of an advertisement looking to sell Hulk merchandise to any curious individual looking for more Hulk stuff after seeing the upcoming movie. The book's author spends time telling us just how great a director Ang Lee is and how each actor in the movie is the best actor ever and how the Hulk himself is the best comic character of all. With only a few interesting notes(a full color reprint of The Incredible Hulk no. 1, some behind the scenes photos of the old Hulk TV show, and some pics from the upcoming movie) and spending most of the time it ends up making fun of comics, this book is recommended for only the most avid of Hulk fans."
1,This is an Encyclopedia?,"After finishing the first chapter, I knew I had just thrown away $.... You'd think the Hulk was invented by Axel Alonzo and Bruce Jones. What about the other four decades? Garbage. It never gets better.You've been warned."
3,"A great overview of the Hulk, but NOT an encyclopedia","First of all, this book is probably a great buy for Hulk fans if you want some background on the Hulk in comics, TV, animation, and the new movie. It also includes three comic stories- the first Hulk story, a sample issue of the current series, and the issue of the Ultimates with the Hulk. However, anyone looking for a repeat of the terrific X-Men Encyclopedia, or even the mediocre Marvel Encyclopedia Vol. 1, will be disappointed, as there is VERY little encyclopedic information. (One reason I think it's a bit unfair that it's shrinkwrapped- in stores, you can't tell what you're getting.) The Hulk Ultimate Guide by Tom DeFalco is MUCH better for that."
3,Advertisement Book,"This book will not teach you anything about animatronics, it's purpose is to show businesses how to use animatronics as an edge to lure in customers. It has lots of nice pictures, but will NOT teach you a single thing about the mechanics, fabrication, or electronics of an animatronic. If you want to use animatronics to sell a product but are not planning on building it, buy this book, but if you are planning on building it, strictly avoid this book. The books title should not be animatronics, it should be called propaganda with animatronics."
5,a cracking book,Mike Bell has done the gardening world an enormous service with this book.It has been hard to find practical solid info on bamboos-perplexing nomenclature and tales of rampant invasive behaviour have left many cautious and perplexed. This work provides clear practical guidance and is beautifully illustrated.Useful for beginners and comprehensive enough to be an essential purchase for all enthusiasts.
3,"""Diluted Qawalli""","If you're looking for some real, pure Nusrat, search elsewhere.Most of the songs are Michael Brooks experiments. I only liked one song,his classic: Mustt Mustt.If you want to hear some real Qawwali, Shahbazz and Shahen-Shah and better choices for you."
2,dissapointed,"the test patterns stink for calibration,i like avia or avia 2 for this.it is a good learning video though."
3,Not as helpful as I expected.,This calibration disk is the first I have ever used. I purchased a Panasonic plasma and decided to calibrate it with this. It has a few test for picture quality but not nearly as many as I would have expected. I guess it was worth it. I got it for $11 with shipping so if you can get it that cheap I would recommend it. A little to advanced for me though.
2,Way too technical for the average user,"I recommend that the average HD user NOT purchase this item. On the front of the package it claims ""Easy to use HD set-up toolkit."" That couldn't be the furthest thing from the truth. You'll be way over your head in technical jargon and explanations that are completely useless to the basic user wanting to calibrate their HDTV. This disc features a horrible menu system that is confusing to navigate and understand. It took me awhile to figure out where to go to calibrate my set without hearing the lecture about the evolution of HD. The narrator will talk FOREVER about what adjustments you'll eventually have to make but you'll never know when exactly to make those adjustments. I advise you to stay away from this calibration disc unless you're a professional audio/video engineer with a Masters degree. Because only then would you be able to make sense of this confusing mess."
2,quite poor communication and absorbed,"Let me start by saying that I have a BFA in film and I work as a director in the film industry for a decade now. I understand 95% of what Joe is talking about. But man... did he show anyone his final cut before he went to press?It DID help me get better contrast, but the color section is so poorly narrated. you'll just get confused. There is NO explanation on HOW to use the color gels. what is the right configuration? or wrong one? especially for red and green.If you go to his website, you'll find that there is NO phone number, NO email and NO support available! Perhaps he was overwhelmed with all the incoming questions that his video raises? but fails to answer?This has the capacity a GREAT video... but only if there was someone more caring about the viewers experience... and not so self absorbed in jargon that really doesn't apply to the end result: A BETTER LOOKING PICTURE"
3,Good product,"Worked as advertised, I find the navigation of the menus to be a bit clunky, other than that very helpful."
1,International Buyers Beware - Region Locked,Just be careful when you purchase this as it is REGION LOCKED (not falsely but truly!). A totally puzzling decision given the interntational market.
2,Digital video essentials,I felt that the DVD was very hard to use unless you knew the technology involved. I also felt that there could have been a basic programming screen that would have been simpler to use for the average user.
3,No recommended for anyone but a dedicated technician.,"This is the second disk I have purchased.I initially invested in the Spears and Munsil calibration disk. i think i understand it and I did effectively calibrate several areas. However, neither disk is that user friendly and unless you are prepared to spend a lot of time studying the different screens that are used to calibrate the tv, you should not make the investment. i have a panasonic 50gt25. I finally just adjusted it visually to suit my taste and sold the disks on ebay."
3,Digital Video Essential: HD Basics (Blu-ray),Good basic tool to check calibration. Not a lot of detailed documentation. Basically just a good tool to make sure everything is working.
1,Don't waste your money....,Basically tells you that you need to hire some one to set up your HD TV.. To much Tech stuff. Ended up doing it by eye......
3,okay but not great,"This is an okay calibration tool. I rented it from Netflix before purchasing. The product discusses CRT and projection TVs but says little or nothing about flat panel TVs, the most prolific on the market today. They haven't made CRT TVs in HD for many years so I don't see why they keep referring to those at all. Another gripe is a long winded discussion about calibrating color saturation with some kind of blue filter test screen which doesn't exist on the DVD or, at least, I couldn't find it. As others have mentioned here there is no tint or hue calibration which does seem odd. I would recommend renting this DVD rather than buying it."
3,"A Bit Confusing, But Entertaining & Visual","This Spanish film is a strange one, a hard one to follow story-wise, but visually striking and interesting most of the way.The story involves people with th ability to steal ""luck"" from other people and then taking it away from fellow takers. Make sense? Hmmm......that's for you to decide. I will say it's an intriguing film.The DVD transfer is sharp and has good sound."
4,"Good Luck, Bad Luck, We all have it","This film does not involve anoyone you've seen on Texas Hold 'Em. In fact, they don't even play any cards in this movie. They do, however, have many unique ways of gambling and finding out what kind of luck you have. I especially enjoyed the part where a prospective lucky man blindfolds himself and runs across a busy freeway at night to prove himself.A few of the characters don't seem very believable. That is, the actors don't seem to relate to the characters they are playing. A few of the roles seemed rather hollow to me.The action only ceased for a few dramatic pauses, and the ending was unique. I would share this one with all my friends.And even my mom."
5,"For What It Is, Worth The Price","This is very easy to use and I like how light it is and that there is no loading drawer, so even if you have to move it often as I do the disc stays in place. I bought this as I needed something cheap, compact, and easy to dis/re connect. I have the one with the drawer-loading option, and they just aren't as durable. I wanted to move the device from the playroom to the outdoor projector and to the eliptical with ease. I am so content with this player, I am skipping the to-and-fro and getting a couple to keep with the projector and eliptical since the price is right and this one has stood up to heavy and irreverent (toddlers) usage. It is simple, straight-forward, and no-fuss."
2,Perform poorly after about a dozen uses,"As 'NLee the Engineer' noted: ""[These batteries] long term self-discharge rate is disappointing.""That's exactly my experience. I purchased these for using with Wii remotes, and they become discharged within a couple weeks of light use. The remote sensor on battery life also cannot give an accurate reading with these, which leads me to believe that they cannot maintain a proper voltage... perhaps there's still juice left, but if the batteries are unable to maintain a stable and proper voltage, then the cannot run many devices that require AA batteries.I've found these to be on par with much cheaper rechargeable batteries that I've purchased. I won't buy Sony batteries again."
4,Sony AA rechargeables,"I understand this Sony rechargeable is better, charged them and placed in camera will see."
4,Review from the Synthesis,"The latest Willie Nelson album is a mostly mellow affair comprised of original material, three duets and a couple choice covers. The Nelson-penned ""Texas"" expresses his love for the Lone Star State with a fitting Tex-Mex mix of country pedal steel moaning over a south-of-the-border beat while a guitar dances between the two influences. Things get jazzy on ""Dreams Come True,"" a piano-based duet with Norah Jones. A harmonica adds character to an earnest cover of ""Picture in a Frame"" by Tom Waits, and Greg Allman's ""Midnight Rider"" finally gets things moving on a closing track that could have been written especially for Willie. Highly recommended for you and your horse.- Connell Burton McDanielSynthesis.net"
1,One of Willie's worst...,I have at least two dozen albums by Willie Nelson. This is one is the worst of thebunch.
2,Awful,"I'm a little angry at how this book went completely off the rails and did not seem to resemble the first whatsoever. The characters didn't resemble who Karleen established they were in the first book. I understand people change but this went beyond growth. By the way, whatever happened to Diana? I finished the book and had to go back and reread thinking that I must have missed something. I did not. Why was Jane, after most of two books a secondary character at best, the over-wrought focus of the end? Why does the author feel the need to have the Duchess mull over the same thing with Barbara and her husband each time she is featured? It did nothing to forward the story and after two books on the characters, I think we got the point. There were also characters who had a more primary role such as Klaus, Perryman and Hyancith that were fairly abandoned. It is though the author actually forgot about the story lines she set up for Klaus and Perryman. Bah, indeed."
3,"Just OK, could have been better","I was disappointed in this book after reading THROUGH A GLASS DARKLY. The author went too deep into the plot surrounding the King of England and not deep enough into the life of Barbara Devane from about the middle of the book on. The happenings at the end of the book that were barely mentioned should have had alot more written about them (such as Barbara remarrying and Hyacinthe coming home). It is correct to say that this book is not necessarily a romance, although I would liked to have had some more romance to the story. I do feel that the story could have been written better than it was, but it was good to at least have a continuation from the first of the series."
3,Now Face to Face,"After reading ""Through A Glass Darkly"", I thought Koen's ""Now Face to Face"" would be another hit but it turned out to be a disappointment. Many people or events written elaborately in the beginning of the book ended roughly with just barely ""explanations"". It is no match with her ""Through A Glass Darkly""."
1,A book full of fat hatred,"I was so disappointed with this book. It's absolutely filled with fat hatred! I spent chapter after chapter reading Lara say terrible things about being fat, and she only barely begins to stop doing it in the last chapter. I would never, ever give this book to an overweight young girl. I honestly think it could be damaging."
2,Not Up To Cherie Bennet's Usual Standards,"Now, I know this is not a truly serious piece of fiction. It's fluff and it's meant to be a quick read, so do not think that I went into the book with the wrong mindset. I have read Cherie Bennet's books for years, not just the Sunset Island ones but others as well (I believe there is one called Whatever Happened to Amber, that I would recommend) I was very excited about this book when it arrived, but after reading it was quite dissapointed. The book's plot was an interesting one, but it was not very well written and comes across as being completely and utterly cheesy. A better book dealing with a sudden change in how one establishes one's identity is Izzy Willy-Nilly, by Cynthia Voight. It doesn't deal with weight gain, but it addresses almost the exact same issues with a much more insightful and in depth view. Skip this book unless it's the last one you have in your house to read, and get something better to occupy yourself with until then."
4,Great Book for Teens!,"This book was very good. I am not usually into teen books, but, I must say, I enjoyed this one thoroughly! Cherie Bennet is an amazing author with quite some talent. She has proven herself greatly as a teen author with this book, Life in the Fat Lane. I honestly could not have enjoyed this book more, and I am anticipating the sequel! A wonderful book, if you love teen fiction, and even a great book if you don't normally like teen books. Definately, and very truely, A Great Book for Teens!"
5,Greatest Book I ever read!,"Life in the Fat Lane was the best book I read in a lon time. It is about a girl is has everything: popularity, great boyfriend, cool friends. Right after she wins homecoming queen, she starts to gain weight. Soon she is up to 200 pounds. Then her parents relationship start to ""dissolve."" She hates being fat and wishes she can just crawl up and die. This is a great book for young people to read. I bet you will enjoy this book!"
3,Life in the fat lane review,"I liked this book because of the ingeneral topic. The way everyone started to hate her was funny. also the way it took place in early high school, were I am going.The worst part of the book was when she started to loose the weight that she had gained back. See in the book she got really big, becauseall she cared about aws her self. Then she didin't care so much about her self, and started to loose back the weight.The setting was the best part of the book, because it took place in high school. The conflict the next best part because of the weight gain."
5,An awesome novel for young adults,"Lara Ardeche seemingly was seemingly perfect. It was like she had everything every teenage girl dreams of. That is, until she gains weight. I have recently read ""Life in the Fat Lane"", and I think it has made a lasting impression on my life. This book teaches that just because you are thin, doesn't mean you are perfect, despite how everything might seem. This is an excellant book."
4,A Classic Anne Perry,"I've always enjoyed Anne Perry's Charlotte and Pitt mysteries more than her Monk and Latterly mysteries. They are not perhaps as deep but they are usually much more fun. I find it easier to identify with the main characters and the ambience of their lives is more satisfying.Seven Dials, the most recent Charlotte and Pitt mystery, is for me one of her better recent books. The writer's facility for setting a scene, whether it is a society event, the slums of the east end of London or the streets of Alexandria is unparalleled. She makes her way unerringly through the mind-boggling convolutions of Victorian morality without miring the reader in its tedious virtue.This is another of Anne Perry's good yarns, complete with Gracie, Aunt Vespasia and sister Emily. It is full of strong emotions, well-honed dialogue and spiced this time with Pitt's visit to Egypt."
1,A very lame ghost story,"A town that is cursed, a doomed cast of characters, empty, puerile dialog surrounding a predictable, hackneyed theme... a waste of time.I am an avid reader. Peter Straub's review inspired my purchase. I have loved reading almost every book he's written. And, because he touted The Keeper, I decided it must be a worthy read.I don't like giving up on something once started, so I trudged on even though I thought the story was one of unlikable, self pitying puppets running mindlessly in circles--and bound to stay that way.I breathed a sigh of relief when I read the final sentence.I give it less than 1 star. Not because I enjoy being a critic, but as a caution to anyone looking for a good ghost story."
3,Not as good as I thought it was going to be. . .,"was actually a bit disappointed in this novel. It was not as good as I thought it was going to be.Still, for a first-time author it was a well-written book. It had good plot and character development, it just wasn't as fast-paced as I like.I know that Sarah has since written another book - called The Missing, I believe. I do not know if it is a sequel to this one, or a completely separate story - either way, I will still probably check it out, one day, as I bet Sarah will only grow in her talent.myspace.com/horror_reviews"
3,"Definite talent, but a bit difficult to read at times","Langan definitely has talent, and has crafted a rather intricate story about one town and its sordid history. The story is rather dark and it is hard to empathize with many of the characters. I also agree with another reviewer about the change 3/4 of the way through the novel, though pushing through to the ending is worth it. I was actually surprised at how much I liked the way the last few chapters wrapped up. I'm glad that I kept on to the end, and I'm definitely going to be keeping an eye out for more from Langan."
4,"4.5 Stars - not bad, mostly",It was an enjoyable read to pass the time despite the gruesome details in most of the book. The problem I had with it were a couple of particularly personally offensive bits and a few instances of useless information. It was an interesting story of hurt and angst and loss of hope and terrible tragedy combined with the bad side of human nature. I recommend this book to anyone with a strong stomach or a less than vivid imagination. The ending was half pleasing and half predictable. I will probably sample other works of this author for my Kindle in the future.
1,Waste of time,"The book starts off well but by the middle of the book, I just wanted it to end. I kept waiting for it to get better but it just got more bizarre and had a stupid plot. I couldn't wait for it to end and then I felt like I just wasted my time. It was a freebie and worth every penny."
1,gave it a fair try,i can appreciate most genres in books but i cannot believe this was ever put in print. i found it to be mind numbing in stupidty and i dont know what its purpose is. what a waste of my time.
2,"I tried, but...","I really wanted to like this novel, but I couldn't. I tried to get into the story, but finally gave up about halfway through. It just wasn't that great of a story. Most of the characters seem contrived, though I did like Liz Marley. I just wish the others had been as interesting as she was.I don't like to give books negative reviews, so I'll just say perhaps this just wasn't my kind of story..."
1,well written but.,"there are no heroes, only victims. imagine poltrgeist if everybody died and nobody tried very haed to help each other or even themselves so you did not really care anyway. great writing in service to nothing. what a bummer."
3,Disappointing!!,"After reading Lessons in Love #1 (lord dare's story), I looked eagerly for this sequel. But it was a slow tedious read (until the last 2 chapters which were quite good.) ""Saint"" propositioning Evie every other page god fairly tiresome very early. And the fact that she never stood up to her brother Victor was also disappointing. However, the premise that there is good in everyone and the dedication with which she believed in Saint was quite nice. How wonderful he became because of her faith in him (the last chapters) was great.I think this book had so much potential but in totality, itmissed the boat for me."
3,Weak heroine,"Suzanne Enoch's new book is not worth reading. Evie is a throwback to heroines of twenty years ago. Nowadays I expect more in a heroine, even a Regency debutante. Enoch's young miss is a bore and truly a ""silly"" creature. Her desire to help the young orphans is half-hearted at best. I've enjoyed other books by Enochs, but this one was disappointing."
3,Nothing to write home about,"This is a somewhat engaging book with some nice stretches, but all-in-all a bit slight. Lightman's exposition on mathematics and physics and the lure of discovery in those areas was quite well done, but Bennett never really came alive for me and when the end came I was glad the book was over. I wasn't wanting more.I think Einstein's Dreams is a better book."
1,An opposite opinion,"This book is nothing more than a publicity stunt and yet another attempt to blame others for the choices that we make. Traci obviously suffered some abuse but don't we all. Her discredit of the adult industry is interesting because without that past career, she would not be where she is today. I am a ""porn star"" myself and I know lots of others. Lots of them are happy, healthy women who are responsible for their choices and proud of them. She got mixed up with a bad crowd which from MY experience is the exception, not the rule in our industry. Don't waste your money on this book unless you support another form of exploitation by her and the publisher."
4,"Convincing, interesting and disturbing","This book was a story that is told all too often. A young neglected girl's first experience with attention results in her being sexually assualted. She is not given any support, help and the shame of the incident was placed on her. Her confusion and neglect make her open to being exploited. I feel enraged at the snotty, jerk-off people who snicker and drool in their reviews about her experience with porn. Of course, they believe that she LOVED it. They have to. Traci's experience with disrespect, sleaze and abuse written about in heart-wrenching detail destroys the fantasy of porn. I found this book to be very engrossing and enraging at the same time. The pathetic, sleazy allegations by others that 'she loved every minute' only display their own denial and guilt."
2,i just don't believe her,"i am not here to make any moral judgement, and frankly speaking if she is not a porn star, then she is nothing. thus, i am glad that she was into porn, so that i get to watch her in action.my problem with this book is that she is just not believable. of all the books, articles, and interviews that i have read, unless all other people were lying, there is no way in hell that history unfolded the way traci lords had described in her book."
3,Not an expose of the porn world,"Underneath It All is not a behind the scenes look at the porn world. It is a story of a woman who had a very rough life and has managed to pull herself up. There is no ""graphic"" details of the porn industy. However she does go into some detail of how various people took advantage of her, of drug addiction, of a very unhappy childhood, and how she worked to overcome and make something of herself."
5,phantastic philm!,"OK so now that I've annoyed you with really bad phonetic jokes....for the brave few willing to get past that obvious mark of bad taste....phantasm is a truly unique addition to any horror fans library. i remember first seeing the film many years ago and the starkness and eerie quite of the mausoleum is something that has always stayed with me. the flying orbs are a great vehicle for terror. If you are new to Don Coscarelli's movies I hope this will encourage you to check out the sequels to Phantasm and of course the mighty Bubba-Hotep! (Long live the king!) The movie has a great balance of drama and good old 70's cheese (not over the top in my opinion....just enough to make you sit back and smile). After all when was the last time an aging ice cream vendor with pattern baldness was a hero!!? All kidding aside though, as a pretty avid horror movie junkie, and a fan that looks for really good horror films that continue to stand the test of time....this is one of them!"
4,Beware of the Tall Man!,"I remember when this movie first came out! It was different, and you really didn't know what the hell was going on, at first! I really like this movie because at the time, the producers had the guts to try and do somethig different! This movie spawned 4 more sequals, but none of them matched up to the original!"
1,Peew!,"I saw this movie when I was 15 or 16 in 1979 and it scared me to pieces. It scared me so bad that I made the guy who took me to this movie stay on the phone with me all night after he dropped me off at home. I woke to the sound of his snoring on the other end. I couldn't look at, let alone buy, a full length mirror for years. But seeing it again in 2008...wow, what a bad film! Maybe I've gotten jaded by today's horror films because the effects in this one are horrible.It's good for the nostalgia and camp: a movie to watch with your friends, drink a few beers, while each and every one of you proclaim that even you can act better than the actors in this movie."
5,From an Error When Horror Movies Were Great,"Phantasm is a creative, original horror film from a time long gone. The DVD is good as well; not only does it have trailers, but also tv spots as well as radio spots"
2,This film is a long way from being the best horror film ever,I have read alot of rave reviews about this one but I just watched it and I kind of felt like I just wasted $3. The film was'nt too bad until half way through we are shown a truly ridiculous buzzing fly kind of creature with glowing pink eyes and I just gave up on it from there. I have to say that it was NOT scary or gory and I have seen alot better low budget horror movies.
4,"The Ultimate 70""s horror expirience.","Watch this expiriment in horror/cheesiness, and you'll wanna hang out with Mike, Jody and everyone's favorite ice cream dude Reggie. You'll want to cruise to the local Tavern in the Cuda, and try and pick up hot chicks in lavender at the local Tavern while trying to ditch the annoying Mike....but all the while the ominous Tall Man is searching for your soul. Cool horror flick just cheesy-eerie and scary enough. The extras on the DVD are second to none...watch for the ultra cool interview with Angus ""Boooyyyy!"" Scrimm and director Coscarelli by an ultra hip seventies dude wearing a polyester leisure suit! The on-screen commentary by all the principals is a must if you are a hard-core Phantasm fan. Angus Scrimm is a real smart aleck, and very funny. Too many others to list, but this is a must buy if you love Phantasm...highly recommended."
3,"Good, but has some weaknesses...","First, I should clearly state that I am a huge Neil Gaiman fan; however, I did see the movie version of Coraline first. Surprisingly enough, I found myself agreeing with another reviewer here: I actually liked the movie version a little better, simply because it really does feel more complete.Although I would not say this is automatically a detriment, Coraline is told in fairy-tale format, meaning that information not strictly necessary to the plot is not present. Why did Coraline's famliy move? Why did the ""other mother"" come to exist? More importantly, what does she want? These are all questions the movie attempted to answer, but are not raised in the book.Don't get me wrong, I think this is a great book for younger kids. It's creepy, and appeals to their ""fantastical"" side. However, for older readers looking for more explanation than the book gives, I'd recommend they try the film version."
2,way too scary for younger children,"This book was assigned to my 8-year-old at school, and I decided to read it myself after he said he was afraid to look at it when he was alone.Even as an adult, I was pretty creeped out by the demon-mother character, and it was completely inappropriate for a second-grader.I think it borders on abusive to give this book to any child younger than 10 or 11."
3,A slightly disturbing and very addicing story.,"'Coraline' is a mix of a fairy tale and a horror story. It was a bit predictable though. Coraline opens a door to another universe. Her 'other mother' and 'other father' desperately want her to stay, as they little by little, feed on her soul. When her real parents are taken hostage along with several other children, trapped behind a mirror, who are nothing but memories, Coraline is forced to 'play' with her other mother. Betting her own life. Coraline encounters many strange things including singing rats, and a talking cat. I recommend this book to 10+years who are looking for a good scary story."
2,not so awesome,no this is a book that i dont recommend.but if you want the best book ever get a copy of the hunger games
3,Too Creepy for the Kids,Neil although a gifted author should be saved for a more mature audience. I gave a low rating for this book because it is clearly not material for a young reader. The story itself was well crafted and interesting. The groteque despriptions of the characters made me turn on an extra light. This however is a not a book you tuck your children in to bed with.
5,An awsome book!!!!!,"There is nothing else like it. This is a have to read book, I realy do sugest you read this book. I also am starting to think that buttons are scary. If you like mystery books than this is your book!!!!!!"
3,Creepy!,"This book is easy to get into, but all along it seemed kind of like a person's nightmare, which is what I guess the author was getting at. It isn't a mystery though.The main character, a girl named Coraline, walks through a door in her apartment that takes her into a mysterious world that is a copy of her house, but with somewhat different parents and neighbors. Her mom turns into a horrible evil woman with black button eyes that wants to keep her in this world. Coraline is determined to get out, but this woman is determined to keep her in.You would definetly like this book if you like scary books. But don't read it in a dark graveyard at night!"
4,She's as cute as a button.,"This is a children's book by noted author Neil Gaiman. Coraline explores her house and discovers an alternate world ruled by her ""Other Mother"". I don't want to reveal more, but if you've seen the movie, the book's plot is similar. But the book is even creepier than the movie."
4,Mysteriousy Scary!!!!!,It is about a little girl that walks through a core door a second time and uncovers a new flat.The first time she was with her mother and it was just bricks behind the door.Since she was alone she didn't know what was behind the door.The other flat looked just like her other one did except she had an other mother and an other father as the book calls it. The other parents have big button eyes and make good chichen. SCARY!!!!!!!I think if you like scary and freaky mysteries you might like this book.P.S. This involves just a little amout of blood
4,"Good, but possibly better","Just remember this, i did not just read this because the movie came out, i read this in 2007-2008. I think that this book was really good, it's just that it could have been a little longer.Coraline: Coraline is about a girl named Coraline obviously well, Coraline just moved into a new town, new house, new everything. so she feels very put out and very angry. In her new house she discovers a little door she relizes that it leads to another universe, but in this universe everything is wonderfull, but the people that live there, the people that live there claim to be her other parents they were pretty wonderfull at the beginning, but when they won't let her leave, things change."
3,Be aware - cartridge is not included!,"Personal Copier may be good, but without a toner cartridge useless. New Canon cartridge will cost you another $80 ($40 for a refill)"
1,This video is not the full version,I was very disappointed after purchasing this video. I loved the movie I saw on cable but this was NOT the same movie. This video is heavily edited with most of the good scenes missing.
4,Pretty good Softcore porn movie.,"This movie is about a hot young redhead( LoriDawn Messuri)that moves into a new apartment building.She is uptight when it comes to sex but her new hot young blonde neighbor(Jacqueline Lovell)tries to loosen her up a bit...ok,A LOT!Soon after moving into this new apartment this woman sees what she thinks is a murder across from her in the next building.A dangerous and sexy course of events unfold and lead to this hot young redheads sexual awakening.There is a solo scene with LoriDawn as well as her with a few men and also a Girl/Girl scene with Jacqueline Lovell.This isn't the best softcore porn movie i have seen but it is still very hot.Buy the UNRATED version and enjoy.:)"
2,Can't believe anyone could give this junk over 2 stars!,"This is just a fragment on what really happened! The real story wasn't about a sick old, beautiful mother!There were four uncles and one father the movie didn't even mention Franz Lidz's life! Ash was a mean awful boy, not some regular teenager! I would give this 1 star but I love the book, so I have to give it a little credit. But I agree -- read the book!"
3,Good Performances,"Normally I would rate this movie higher, I just feel that the movie is a little too hollywood. But as a film, this is Sentimentalism at it's best. John Tuturo gives a great performance (as usual) as a boys father who is so in love with his dying wife that he overlooks this needs of the rest of his family. Michael Richards plays the dufus (is that spelled correctly?) as usual and I must say, he's damn good at it. I feel that this is a great movie as a family love story, but I can't let slip the Hollywood affect. Film buffs will know what I mean."
3,I haven't read the book,"but I really enjoyed this movie. Most of the reviewers seem to knock the movie because they have read the book. In any case, I think I liked it because the topic of hoarding is close to my heart and the eccentricities are charming and fascinating. I wish it had more depth and so I will probably end up reading the book. If you're interesting in gleaning- another side of hoarding- try ""The Gleaners and I"" for a superficial look at the subject."
4,Quite different from his previous two albums,"Geoffrey Oryema's third album continues to develop his personal style - somewhere between Afro-pop and Brian Eno-esque ambient music, without the cliches of either.As always, Geoffrey's voice is the most essential component, floating here above a more electronic soundscape than he's employed previously.Not as compelling as his second album (Beat the Border), Night to Night remains in frequent rotation through my CD changer. A great album."
4,DM Singles Box 1,"The Six Box Set is trully a must for the Depeche Mode connoisseurs and collectors.The UK/USA releases of 1991 and the US one of 2004 have the same sound quality (not remastered), but differs in quality of box covers. Singles miss the 2004 production year which is stated in the booklet.Delivered by post over the ocean from Seller: sarahmusic1 , even earlier than expected in comparatevely good condition in a plain bubble envelope with respect to Amazon's warning: ""Note on Boxed Sets: During shipping, discs in boxed sets occasionally become dislodged without damage."" I received CD #2 with minor scratches but with no hearable damage."
3,"Worth a read, I guess","I never read his columns, so I came to this book without prior affections. It is a string of interesting, sometimes humorous anecdotes with quite a cast of characters, but I did not find it great writing that placed me in Paris. Not very descriptive and the author's ego was in the way too much of the time. Interesting, I suppose, if you want to know a lot about Buchwald but not so much about Europe."
3,A few good songs,"Overall, not as good as I was expecting but o.k. Relative to other concert dvd's a 3 star. Better to rent this one."
5,"Rewind It, And Watch It Again","There is no stopping the Eurythmics. In this fantastic 1 Hour and 36 minute video, they lash out almost every hit they had back in the 80's. Annie's Voice, and Dave's guitar experience, makes them one of the fantastic duo of the 80's. A must get for any Eurythmics fan."
1,BOOOOOOOOO!!!,"NO LO COMPREN, ES PERDIDA DE DINERO!!! CANTA MUY MAL!COMPREN EL DE BELINDA, ELLA SI CANTA Y ACTUA!"
1,Unbelievable....,"How could it have been published?The ""hero"" is shallow, but arrogant in his self-confidence, annoying, irritating, and at some times - simply dumb, at others - a real bastard.The story might have been good, but is undercooked. What is it anyway? A crime mystery? A haunting tale? A romance with poor erotic undertone?Too much of meaningless descriptions of interiors and exteriors, clothes and meals. I was waiting to see where it all would lead - NOWHERE, as it turned, just to make more pages...Another novel of the series I made mistake to order, Periwinkle Lies, just as bad. Not a single character has any life in him/her."
3,American Beauties,This video turned out to be American Beauties-Sexy Girls Next Door. It only had two girls out of about 10 that got my blood pumping or fulfilled my fantasies. Just tease.
4,Excellent American Debut,"While Matthew Good's Vocals are similar to ED K. from Live, the songs themselves are totally different. I've never heard a CD quite like this there is aggression, fear, love, and chaos all in one CD. some of the best tracks are ""Strange Days,"" ""Deep Six,"" ""the Future Is X-Rated,"" and ""Jenni's Song."" Two songs sure to bring up parential concern are ""Born to Kill"" and ""a boy and His Machine Gun."" while there should be concern about these songs listen closely and you'll hear that MGB just wants you to pay more attention to your kids. Another Social commentary is ""Everything Is Automatic."""
5,How to do inductive Bible Study,"If you aren't sure how to study the Bible without using resources, study notes or commentaries, this is a great reference. To get the big picture, this has detailed information on how to make charts for books or long passages. It also explains the inductive Bible study, which is a simple and easy method to understanding how to read and interpret the Bible."
2,Ew.,It just wasn't good. Had a greasy texture and for all the horrible ingredients in it I don't understand what would bring someone to buy one. Had to wash mouth out.
3,HOW TO HALVAH,"RECEIVED THE HALVAH PROMPTLY. THE SHIPPING SEEMED TO BE MORE THAN I HAD EXPECTED. THE PRODUCT ITSELF WAS, SIMPLY, O.K."
4,Great Book,"I felt that this was an excellent book. It included interesting characters, a great plot, and what I felt was an outstanding ending. I liked the many obstacles the characters had to overcome to reach their goals and in a way the sad parts of the book. Although they were sad I felt they were necessary to really make the reader feel like they were part of the book (a fellow mourner). Also, I loved the vivid descriptions Linda Sue Park gave of the beautiful setting, as well as the characters feelings and thoughts. Overall I felt that this was a great book that can be enjoyed by people of all ages."
5,enjoyed thoroughly by both me and my 9 y o,"A Single Shard tells the story of Tree Ear, a Korean orphan living hundreds of years ago. He ekes out a living with his foster father, Crane Man. They live most of the year under a bridge. Eventually, Tree Ear gets an idea in his head: prove himself a hard-worker to Min, the town's best potter, and become an apprentice in the art of making celadon ceramics.This description sounds terribly depressing, and pretty snooze-worthy. However, the book is quite the opposite, full of optimism and triumph in the face of challenge. Park's descriptions of ancient Korea and the art of making celadon pottery are fascinating, and the characters are appealing, particularly Tree Ear, Crane Man, Kang, and Min's wife.Also noteworthy, this book is 100% clean. Not one bad word, no romance, nothing. And you don't miss these elements one bit.Highly recommended for ages 10 and up."
3,Korean Star,"I rate this 3 stars because the name Tree-ear got me bewildered. The Korean Culture of this novel wasn't well explained and the "" Single Shard"" part happened until about 80% of the book.Author Linda Sue Park was missing the climax of this book and she did not have good sequence. I'd have to admit, the last parts of the book were pretty great the action, thee stesl, and the loss.I highly do not recommend this garbage unless you can actually understand this book of Korean Culture and fiction. Thank you for reading and interpreting this recommended Review."
5,Newbery Winning Book,"I first read A Single Shard last summer. When I finished, I knew this book would win the Newbery. I have never felt that way about any other book! Linda Sue Park is a beautiful writer and excellent storyteller. A Single Shard is set in 12th century Korea and tells the story of an orphan boy who becomes the apprentice to a master potter in a small village known for its fine pottery. This story is classic historical fiction that is able to take the reader to another time, another country, and another culture and still connect with the hopes and dreams of today's youth. You don't have to be Korean to identify with the characters in this story. Readers young and old will love this touching story of faith, friendship, and perseverance.Readers will also enjoy Linda Sue Park's other books, ""Seesaw Girl"" and ""Kite Fighters""."
4,A well-written tale that speaks to the soul.,"I didn't really expect to enjoy this story as much as I did. What I enjoy about Linda Sue Park's style is that she doesn't write down for kids, nor does she shy away from poetic metaphors or other literary devices. Her skill in language and character development make this a compelling novel, and I look forward to reading more by this author."
4,"Happy, sad, adventurous, this book has everything (Bubba)","Tree-ear is a young orphan boy who lives under a bridge with Crane-man, an older man with a deformed leg. Tree-ear regularly sneaks onto the potter Min's property to watch him throw a pot. When Min wasn't there on a throwing day Tree-ear took the rare oportunity to closer examine the potters work. Tree-ear was startled while holding a pot and accidentlly broke a pot. Tree-ear must work for the master potter to pay for the damage. When Tree-ear is sent to Emissary Kim in Songdo to show Min's inlayed pottery, his entire world changes with each village.I think this book took way too long to warm up. But once it did I couldn't put it down. I went through many different emotions while reading this book including, happy and sad. After I read this paperback book I actually understoodthe cover.Even though it took a long time to get into I would definatly reccomend it."
4,It's ok,Had to read this for 6 grade lit. study it was good at the end then ok in the beginning and middle.
4,A bright splash of color!,"These will really perk up your recipe box with their bright colors! Yes, the card stock is thin (pretty standard these days - unfortunately) and they waste a bit of space for nutritional info (not necessary for me at least), and lastly this is the 3X5-inch size. If you haven't begun a recipe collection yet, try the 4X6 size. More room to write (or write large.) I think one of the best features is that they come with their own plastic sleeves! These sleeves can be purchased separately for your other cards and I recommend them. It's unbeliveably easy to ""dirty"" them up when in use."
3,Something different... but not all that,"I ordered this CD a couple weeks ago because of the outstanding reviews I read on this site. Plus I was excited to see that a few Armin and PvD tracks were on the album. I really don't see what all the fuss is about, truthfully. I like to think that I am pretty educated when it comes to music (I have been listening to house and trance music for a good 5 or 6 years) but I found this set to be disappointing. Yes, the mixing is pretty much seamless, and the sound is interesting. But I found it to be far from ""enchanting."" I can see myself throwing it in every once in a great while when I crave something different, but other than that... I suggest you don't waste your time."
2,Poor quality,"This product was not well made for the price charged. I would have expected a heavier gauge pan to start. This is no heavier than some of my cheap pans. Unlike most spring-form pans, the bottom does not fit into a groove in the side. The side is simply turned over and there is a gap where the seam meets the bottom. Result - a leak. One other annoyance is that the label was adhered with glue that would not soak off or scrape off with a wooden spoon. I had to resort to a solvent to remove the residue. A lot of manufacturers are going with a type which easily rubs off, almost in a roll. If you're interested in a small cake pan, there are better choices."
5,Classic Tangerine Dream with orchestral sounding themes.,This CD is for all those early TD fans that believe TD is no longer capable of producing those rich slower melodies. The type of sound that should be produced by a full orchestra. Quinoa has the typical dream-like quality in the music that TD is famous for. The more I play this album the better it becomes. The depth of the music increases each time I listen. This CD has a rich multi-layered sound and is a fine addition to my collection. Reminds me of 'Shy People'.
4,A personal favorite from the 80s,"A feature with a feel I consider to be slightly different than others. This movie bases itself around a piece of machinery that becomes much more. Like many movies out there it explores concepts of AI, but further more artificial emotions. Expressed in what I feel is a highly entertaining and humorous manor, it is definately worth a viewing, and perhaps owning.Of course there is the draw back, of the fact the DVD is letterbox widescreen, meaning that if you have, or plan to get a widescreen TV the quality will be short of that of an anamorphic version which appears not to exist at the time, it is the sole reason for 4 versus 5 stars."
2,Where are the Closed Captions?,I bought the movie as a replacement for the VHS copy I recorded from HBO. I am disappointed in the DVD though. As the DVD does not have closed captions I still hold on to the VHS copy as it does. Why on earth would the studio air the movie on HBO with captions but produce the DVD without them?!!
5,Short circuit,Yo laser lips your mamma was a snowblower. haha its so cute everybody at any age would love short circuit.
4,Ooh pretty,"Short circuit is about a military robot that is struck by lightning and basically begins to act human. He befriends Stephanie Speck and she tries to help him. While the military wants it's robot back, there is one particular fellow, Newton Crosby, who tries to meet with Stephanie to get ""Number 5"" back. Newton winds up telling a joke to Number 5 and Number 5 starts laughing, proving it is alive. This was a very good film. I'd recommend it."
2,"Great movie, lousy dvd",This movie deserves much more than a non-anamorphic transfer. C'mon 10 year old quality on a new dvd. A rip off for those of us who care about Johnny Five
2,"Great, fun movie, but the language is terrible","I had such fond memories of this movie from when I was a kid, that I bought it. I started watching it with my children and was very disappointed. The storyline and humor are perfect for children and youth, but they put in language that is almost as bad as you can get. They did not define a target market and stick with it. Without the language it would be a great film for families. With the language it makes it adult oriented, however I believe most adults will find it only slightly amusing.If you are sensitive to foul language, don't buy it. I'll be putting mine on ebay."
2,"oh God, why?!!!!","I remember this movie being really, really fun and great when I was 9. My wife wanted this for our video collection and I hate myself for buying this movie. All I need to know is why she wanted this today! If you have kids, which we do, they'll enjoy this for the first time, but after words they'll be as bored with it as I am. If you are looking for nostalgia, this is the movie, but if you are looking for a good dust collector, buy it quickly!"
3,Cute -but------,"Short Circuit is entertaining enough on a boring day, uplifting enough on a down day. It is just what it says it is --just enough to be what is needed to get over that hump feeling.This movie is great for the young to watch, but if you are an adult don't expect any enlightenment--not there, but it is great for just seeing a movie for the entertainment of seeing a movie."
5,Kids LOVED it,My 9 and 11 year old boys really loved this movie. They spent allowance money to purchase it. The humor is on par with most of the PG animated films and I get a kick seeing a movie I enjoyed when it first came out in the theater.
4,To anybody who is getting the blu-ray version,"To anybody who is getting the blu-ray version, can you please let me know if it has english subtitles or closed caption? I am deaf, thanks!"
5,Short Circuit,Great and funny show keeps you on the edge of your seat with a surprising twist at the end.
2,Not for Young Kids,"I saw this movie a long time ago and had forgotten all but the basic plot. I recently purchased the DVD thinking it would be a fun movie for my younger kids (9, 8, and 6) to watch. Also, it was rated ""PG"" so I thought it would be pretty safe. I was wrong. While the plot is innocent enough, the language was atrocious. I couldn't believe this thing was rated PG and not at least PG-13. Be advised that if you don't want your kids to hear a lot of cursing throughout a movie, then this is not for you."
4,Number 5 is alive!,"I remember our class winning a trip to see this movie when I was in elementary school and of course, we all loved it then. And now, many many years later, I still do love Short Circuit. The movie focuses on a company called NOVA that has constructed these new robots (which, surprisingly, don't look that out-of-date) but when a power surge hits while they are charging up, the robot called Number 5 comes alive and so the adventure begins. As he seeks for ""input"" he meets Stephanie (Ally Sheedy) a kind-hearted animal-loving woman who drives a lunch truck for a living. But when Stephanie discovers that Number 5 is alive, she does everything she can to protect him from the guys at NOVA who just want to disassemble him. Great fun for a low-key night at home, you'll love Short Circuit. Kids will too, but there are some profanities in there so parents, please use your discretion. Enjoy!"
3,Such a Cute Movie if it didn't have all the foul language,"I remember this was the last movie I ever watched with my Dad before he died. I guess that was the sentimental attachment and why I decided to get it, but was APPALLED at the filthy language! It's such a cute movie why do they but all the garbage in? Won't be watching this with my child."
5,Something for Everyone!,"This book is an exciting change of pace from my usual James Patterson, Stuart Woods reads! Great character development, captivating battle scenes, and romance to boot! A great book club experience!"
3,Getting Better,"Hewson improves on his earlier work here. The characters seem to have a little more depth (stress on the ""little""), the plot is intriguing and more believable, a bit more procedure has been introduced into this procedural (including the forensic stuff that's so popular these days), and the author has abandoned his focus on wacky serial killers in favor of a real ""mystery,"" i.e. a crime whose motive, means and perpretrator must be figured out by the detectives and by the reader. In that limited sense, Hewson does stir some echoes of Christie and others. Not a great book, but a readable and enjoyable one."
1,A mess of a mystery,"Some books literally scream for the firm attentions of a good editor and this is definitely one of them. I have read two previous books by this author and thought that they were passably good police procedurals in exotic settings (one of my weaknesses). This book however is so badly written that, had I not been away from home with nothing else handy to read, I would have given up on it more than once. Hewson repeats tired descriptive phrases over and over again (eg. many a""crumbling palazzo""), his characters are pasteboard, the plot is tortuous and the dialogue is stilted. Hewson has good writing somewhere in him but he should search for a publisher who is willing to pay an editor to check his every sentence."
3,"shiny, silky, and one time use!","Expected a bit more than a 1x use out of these. Bought 2 pairs and wore the first for my wedding, still haven't worn the 2nd pair yet. To be fair I ran around a whole lot, jumped around and misplaced shoes and did more than I usually would have when wearing delicate stockings, but they did have a lot of runs in them after taking them off. SO they probably hold up decent for girls who aren't running around and possibly tripping and falling a lot or dancing and bouncing around. They are very shiny. Some other stockings by this brand hold up better, but don't have the elastic at the top to keep the stockings up in case you have a garter issue."
1,HORRIBLE,"The first time trying to put them on, my love ran them horribly, all the way up the leg, when trying to put them on. Not worth a penny, if you ask me! If I could give them a ZERO, I would."
5,Very Entertaining!,This was a very entertaining romantic suspense. Loved the plot and the likable characters. I highly recommend.
1,They suck.,"Anti-flag blows. There's nothing different about them, nothing unique. They use old, washed up political lyrics to try to get their point across, which wasn't even their's from the beginning. Bands like Crass, Reagan Youth, Youth Brigade, and Bad Brains are GOOD punk/hc bands because they have their own styles, but Anti-flag's styles have been stolen and used up. All they do is whine, instead of acting or thinking of solutions for the world's problems. They suck, and that's the proof."
5,Enjoyed it,"Many of the movies I get from here are what I want, this one fit the Bill.Many of the movies I get from here are what I want, this one fit the Bill."
2,my rating,"most gay movies are cheesiness and not done very well. with low budget cost. acting is not great.this one is that bad.OK Ive seen some good gay movies. I will list a couple of of gay movies I liked,1Beautiful Thing2Nico and Danni3Come Undone4Queer as folkI really thought they where better films rarely dose that happen"
4,Initially skeptical but pleasantly surprised,"I initially didn't hold too much hope for this film because I really didn't enjoy Rock Haven by the same director. However, I was pleasantly surprised. It is definitely more subtle than the average American gay film. It's not a happily ever after - on the contrary, I think it's guaranteed to make you cry. It deals with a relationship which could have been."
2,"""High Art?""","Here it is... one of the only Realworld Records releases that I can genuinely and enthusiastically say I did NOT enjoy upon first hearing it. There are a couple of great songs here -- ""Morecambe Bay,"" ""Chinese Canon,"" and, to a lesser extent, ""My Mother Is Not the White Dove."" The remaining tracks are nothing more than stuffy, pretentious noodling masquerading as artistic exploration. I can understand the desire to honor the deceased with ""Cage Dead,"" but the end result comes off sounding downright corny. Meanwhile, ""Ginger"" sloughs on for what seems like hours without ever really making a musical statement. No offense to the customers here who obviously enjoyed the album, but I just didn't ""get it."""
5,incredible sound,"A magnificent collection from a improbable source. The sound is big, the ideas fresh and the performance extraordinary.No words suffice, just get it and let it take you up ""there""."
3,Not the best,"This works, but the parallax errors are significant. There is just no reason to buy a product with such problems at this price point these days. There are much better options available."
4,Good Field Pouch - Recommended,"This good quality pouch is a useful addition to my range kit for holding loose ammo and small accessories. The two pockets are accessed through flaps that are secured with metal twist locks, which makes it unlikely anything will easily fall out if properly closed. The larger pocket is big enough for several hundred rounds of .22 and I can easily get my whole hand into it to reach all the way to the bottom. The smaller front pocket is good for holding my multi-tool, ear plugs, and other useful items. The belt loop is well stitched and large enough to fit on my thick belt.Recommended!CFH"
5,Great Ammo Pouch,"I bought this for my husband for Christmas. It's very durable, much higher quality than I expected. It can hold a full load of ammo with no trouble. It has attachments at the back to hook onto belts, which my husband loves.We're so satisfied with this product, we plan to buy at least two more for the future. We go out shooting a lot and these are very handy. :)"
1,not for everyday use,"Got this Black 2-Pocket Ammo Pouch Black in October 12, 2010for cell phone, 2 keys and wallet, not a overload.The cover clip broke off Jan 6,2011 (87 days)and it cant be returned :("
3,Quality is Good - But MUST Use Belt,"Nice canvas quality - I can put a regular water bottle and couple of snack bars in the large section, keys and chapstick in the smaller - with plenty of room to spare for other small items in either. Big complaint is that the back strap is so wide you need to be wearing a belt to use it - does not lend itself to any adapting to using a carabiner or shoulder strap etc. so I don't see using it much."
5,Good quality for the price,Nice heavy material should last a long time. Good value for the money. Would not hesitate to purchase more when needed.
1,"Love the movie, wish I could play it in this country!!","The movie was not made to play in this country. I did not realize this when I ordered it. Needless to say, I was very disappointed in the purchase, but after communicating with the seller, I was able to return it and received a refund for the price of the movie. I love this movie and have watched it many times on TV. I reordered and have received a copy that is made to play in the US! This situation is not typical, love the movie, hate the fact I didn't understand what Region 2 meant."
4,Keeps you on the edge and some unexpected turns,"I enjoyed the predecessor to the MIA story and I hoped it would meet my expectations. As usual with this author, he didn't let me down. A few of characters were a little more than required (maybe he's preparing us for the next book) but overall a nice read in the summer."
5,This is a must read for Fan!,"This entire series is, I think, the best in the Star Trek collection. I've loved every book related to the New Frontier saga. I can't say enough about it. It's very well written and supports the story line."
2,"""Subtle Knife"" dosen't have the spark of Golden Compass","To me, the Subtle Knife was a huge disappointment. The Golden Compass left me gasping for air; it's the kind of book that it edge-of-your-seat, biting-your-nails, cheering-for-the-characters novel. And the Subtle Knife ... well, all I can say is that Pullman wasn't up to his usual standard. His dialogue is choppy, most of the time stupid or completely useless. The entire book was one giant bog, leaving the reader slogging through the mud of words badly written and a plot badly thought out, until the last three chapters or so. The imagery is completely lacking, and the climatic events not so climatic. For example, I cried twice in the Golden Compass; the Subtle Knife evoked no reaction of that kind from me. In fact, the only reason why I gave this book two stars is that it continues the epic tale of ""Golden Compass"" and reveals some new ideas: the knife, Lyra's destiny, etc., etc. I just hope the next one is better."
1,Completely awful...,"Sorry, I found it confusing, boring, and uninteresting. The whole idea of god being the bad guy is awful. The spectres or whatever did not improve the story one bit, except as a plot point. I didn't like that all the witches got... whatever, and it was overall unpleasant. They make out the church to be the evil one, and while I am not of that specific religion, I think that it is simply wrong. Go ahead and disagree, but I have no intention of reading the next one. The first in the series was almost interesting, but I hated this."
2,"Disappointing after ""The Golden Compass.""","I found this book the most disappointing of the ""His Dark Materials"" trilogy. After Lyra is introduced as such a strong girl character in the first book, it feels as though she loses some of her power in ""The Subtle Knife."" Will takes over, and I'm not impressed."
3,The Subtle Knife,"This book The Subtle Knife by Phillip Pullman was a semi- interesting book. This book is about two young kids on a perilous journey from world to world. The main character is Will Perry, and he is very peculiar about going from one world to another with his friend Lyra. The worlds' have specters stalking the streets and distinct angels sounding in the sky. Will and Lyra discover a deadly secret about an object with an accelerating power. The more they get closer to the end of the quest the object gets stronger. If you like the kind of books that keep you guessing this is the book you should read. It is very exciting at some points in the story, but it is overall pretty boring. Read this book and maybe you'll like it because it is too your taste."
4,Not The Absalute Best...,"Like i said. It's not the absalute best but it still is a good book. I was able to put it down BUT i couldn't. Lyra, Will, and Pantalaimon are riviting characters and they seem so real. It puts a new perspective for me on how preacius life could be and how savage people could be."
4,"Wonderful, With a Capital W","This book is good ,there is no doubt about it. This book will amaze and delight you, althogh you you have to be slightly cofused and shocked about the religios views."
4,Great Book! However....,"This book is great! It has an interesting plot, great characterisation and can appeal to many readers with its fun yet interesting plot. However, it is made painfully clear that this is a middle-volume. Many questions are left unanswered, which makes it a bit of an unsatisfying read. It cannot stand on its own as a book, rather than part of a trilogy, and this is a bit disappointing. However, it is well-written, bringing back favorite characters and introducing new ones, while asking complicated theological questions. All I have to say is: Bring on The Amber Spyglass!"
3,Suffers from Second Book Syndrome,"There was a lot of new information and a lot of new plot to introduce. In contrast to the first book, there was more sneaking around and shuttling back and forth as opposed to rushing onward, and a lot more sitting and puzzling as opposed to acting and doing. I was worried that this would turn into The Story of Will, and although Lyra becomes more the passive 'knower' than the dynamic 'actor' that she was in the first book, I still felt that things didn't overbalance too badly"
3,Do not buy deluxe edition - poor quality edition,"If you are thinking of trading in your older version of this book for the so-called 'deluxe' version, save your hard earned money. As noted in other reviews, this publisher is following a trend I have seen more often and why I won't buy hardcovers at full price or at all.It is printed on cheap paper for the same amount of money a nicer book would sell for. The cloth book marker doesn't make up for the fact that this version of the book is a rip off.What gets to me is that the industry is trying to pull a fast one on the consumer. If they could lower their prices a little, to reflect their use of disposable materials, that would be more honest on their part.But I guess that's what's at issue here. Buy with caution, because if you intend for these books to stay in your library a while, you may be disappointed."
2,More on the same subject,"This novel goes far beyond questioning the teachings of the Church. Pullman seems virulent in his hatred of religion. There is something in his violence that makes the reader feel this is no longer fiction--he really means it. Probably he doesn't have the slightest idea that to anyone with faith this book is profoundly hurtful, to the point of causing physical pain!"
3,Nice Shorts,The material is nice and comfortable even in sweaty conditions.CONS: The tag at the back itches and of course no pockets.
5,Woodstock II 1970,"Woodstock II produced by Bob Maurice, Warner Home Video 1983 released this as Part 2 of the Woodstock rock concert, the 4 day concert that changed the world. It includes legendary performances ofCountry Joe & The Fish doing Rock & Soul Music and I Feel Like Im Fixin to Die Rag. Crosby Stills & Nash with their complex and lyrical Suite: Judy Blue Eyes, Ten Years After singin I'M Going Home, John B Sebastian's beautiful Rainbows All Over Your Blues, Santana's Soul Sacrifice, Sly & The Family Stone performing I Want To Take You Higher, and Finally the legendary Jimi Hendrix soulful instrumental classic ""Purple Haze"". This legendary concert ain't for the younger crowd but worthy of any 60-70's rock music lover. Relive the moment that changed the world."
2,"Not the real papa Wemba, but a sell-out to American market","Only Papa Wemba's superb voice and musicality come across in this record. The songs herein are one-dimensional, bland, uninteresting, like so much of American pop music lately. The real Papa Wemba as he comes across on French import labels is far greater -- a fantastic blend of gorgeous melodies; varied, propulsive rhythms; guitar accompaniment that astonishes with its virtuosity and dynamism; and, of course, Wemba's great voice and magnetic presence. If the American public heard more of this soukous music, many would be enraptured, despite the language gap."
3,Why?,"I cannot imagine why people rave about this book. Any ""expert"" on pizzas that says to use ""bread flour or all purpose"" for the dough--as if they are interchangeable and it does not matter which you use...well, they must not know what they're talking about! This isn't a terrible book, it's just not, in my opinion, the great book that people claim it is."
1,scattered and repetitive,"I am an avid reader of latino fiction and eagerly bought this book hoping that it would be a good addition to my latino literature course. I was thoroughly dissapointed. The text is repetitive and awkward in its prose. Worst of all it presents as a text about Cuban exile, but reads like a tale of a woman who has unresolved issues with her dead father and her disconnected mother. If you are interested in reading about a woman's struggle to understand her identity--this book is a decent read."
1,"first item came damaged, a replacement was never sent.",i first recieved the dyne very quickly but when i openned the box the bottle was open and leaked everywhere. a replacement was supposed to be sent but it never was. bad seller. i didnt even bother calling them because i relized it wouldnt even help. i just took it as a loss of $20.
3,Good for apartment rentals,"These seem to work pretty well. I rent and am worried about smoke and cooking fumes accumulating. I have a 1 BR apartment with the return duct in an AC/Heater closet located near the kitchen. I would suggest stocking up on these and replace them once every 1-3 months. I suppose it's not going to trap all the smoke and cooking fumes, but it's better than the cheap cotton candy filter material that was in my apartment's heater/ac.Edit: The new shipment of 6 filters showed more light showing thru the filters, which means they used less charcoal. I was kind of disappointed."
3,Wolfe Melodrama,"An early Wolfe where Stout still hasn't quite got his main character right (I mean Archie Goodwin, not Wolfe). Like its immediate predecessor, The Rubber Band, the story is highly dramatic and over-written compared with later Wolfes. But it's got pace and a memorable baddie."
5,Effing Awesome At The Right Price,"Thank you, Jamie Hyneman of MythBusters, for giving me the idea to get these shoes. I know yours are red and mine are the ""radioactive"" print, but mine cost $3.49 at Ross. Give the second assist to British actor/comic Stephen Fry.These are so different than any of my previous shoes, which always had a lot of padding. These have just a bit in the sole. I won't be doing exercise in them but they are definitely comfortable and distinctive for casual wear."
2,think foot binding,"in brief:-very uncomfortable compared to every other shoe ive ever worn (i think even wal mart flip flops have an edge on them)-likely caused me what has been a period of unprecedented knee and ankle pain (can't prove theyre the cause but their use is strongly associated with it)-provide absolutely no cushioning of impact-no insole support-while at the same time basically bind your feed, compressing your foot and basically inhibiting its ability to function properly-are wearing out quicker than any other pair of normal shoes ive had in memory, (edge is separating from sole in particular)-actually make me dislike walkingi bought them as a cheap option in a rush.EDIT: Added a star on to be nice. I wanted to mention that these shoes lasted 7 months to absolute destruction as my only footwear, and I got more used to them in time."
3,Good but not Great,"Ravenor is a good effort by Dan Abnett who is, I would assume, the crowned king of Black Library and Games Workshop fiction. I did not find this one as good as his Eisenhorn series, however, simply because it was too choppy. Shifting point-of-views from character to character occurred too frequently for my tastes... sometimes 2-3 times per page. It was difficult for me to keep things in focus. But I'd say it's still a cut above many other 40k novels."
4,Mityvac 7.3 L Fluid Evacuator,The oil vac worked well. I did warm up the engine first to reduce the viscosity which helps the oil suction process. The Mityvac worked very well with no spills or drips. The 7.3 L canister allows for plenty of room to hold the old oil. The vacuum pump works well and holds a vacuum. The design of the product allows for relatively easy cleanup.
1,Worked ok for a while before it self destructed,"Worked fine at first. I drained the oil out right away and cleaned after each use. I used the Mityvac for a couple years (about eight times total) and the last time it collapsed from inside from the pressure making a nice, dripping, hot oily mess all over the garage floor. I liked the product, but it should last longer than a couple years and because of that I would not spend money on another one."
4,evacuator,"thing works great. gotta keep pumping slowly and its not the fastest, but drains whatever in probably 10-15 minutes.should save lots of time on fishtank water changes and auto fluid replacements"
4,"Not bad, it does the job","I used it on my old 2000 RX300 with few problems. Most of the oil got sucked out with the hose provided. Since I didn't measure exactly how much oil I have in the engine, I wasn't sure how much was left over. My guess is probably very little. But I don't see this to be a problem as I change my oil every 5K miles.One complaint I have is the cap(where you poor out the oil). Instead of unscrewing it, I had to use a screw driver to pry it out. I hope this doesn't create a problem the more I do this.Update:Its been almost 2 years since I owned it. Its still working like a charm. It saves me a lot of effort and time when it comes to changing the oil."
5,Very good extractor,"Worked on my '08 Mercedes S550 but, wish the volume of the container was just a tad bigger. My oil change takes 11 qts. so, I have to empty and drain again. Used it to drain Power Steering resevoir on a FordExplorer also. Worked like a charm. I drain the oil semi-warm due, to the hoses being plastic and one reviewer saying the hose collapses when the oil is drained hot. Worked for me."
3,"Okay, but not as good as they used to be.",Well built and sucks great but they no longer build in a float that stops the flow when the unit is full. I left it hooked up after pumping and it filled the reservoir and then filled the pump mechanism with oil. Now it spews oil out the handle when you pump it. Made quite a mess before I figured out what happened. It works okay but you have to monitor it and pull the suction tube before the unit overfills - or get the larger unit if your car happens to take 8 quarts of oil.
1,Does Not Work as advertised,Cheaply build. The system is not sealed enough to allow one to suck the oil out. Too many leaks in the line. I would not recommend buying this item.....
5,Not only the latest but the best one yet!,"I have read and own all books currently out (34 right now). This one, the latest one, is my favorite so far. It contains devolpments in Judd and Lionel's quest to find a way home, a new hiding place for the believers in the Dial home, and even a vist from a prophetic angel. Judd and Lionel are almost home when they run into, guess what?, bounty hunters. The book ends with you wondering what will happen to them both."
4,Not half bad,"ISBN 0380768550 - This isn't the best, or even close to the best, mystery I've ever read - but it IS good, and it's worth a read. It's not hard to keep up with Peggy, or to see what's coming before it arrives, but this is a good book to curl up with when even thinking about doing anything more serious just makes you tired.Peggy O'Neill, apparently permanently single campus cop, meets a new man, makes new friends and finds her second corpse, all within walking distance of work. There's no shortage of people who might have liked to off Cameron Harris, a writer with little nice to say about anyone - even his ""friends"". Peggy needs to stop the killer before the death toll rises, and before SHE becomes the next victim!Good fluff!- AnnaLovesBooks"
5,The Essential 55,This is an inspirational book for all teachers!!! Highly recommended for making your classroom better. It is also hilarious. You'll get a good laugh from it. Ron Clark just reminds us what education is all about.
5,The Essential 55 by Ron Clark,"I am a teacher and never have I found a book that spoke more to me than this one. Ron Clark has developed this list of rules through personal experience. It is funny, thought provoking and absolutely essential to your bookshelf if you are a teacher or a parent. I would recommend this book to everyone!!! My kids even love it. We read things from it in class all the time. The lessons are well worth teaching your students, as well as reminding us of everyday lessons we, as adults, should keep in mind. Well done!"
2,The Essential 55....,"The first ""essential"" gave me the clue that I would not like this book. Saying ""yes sir/mam"" does not show respect. It is how you treat a person that shows respect. To lead children to believe that a ""yes sir"" will get a person somewhere is wrong. I have been teaching for 28 years and in our school we are on a first name basis with our students. The interaction between teacher/student is what teaches respect. Some of the 55 essentials are worth while but most are something parents need to be teaching. Teachers have always needed to teach the parent along with the student. The 55 essentials leaves the parent(s) out of the equation."
5,Ageless Beauty!!,"100% happy with ""Confessions"" wall calendar. I have had every one of her calendars for the last 15 yrs. or so and I think she only gets better with time!!"
3,"Brande's cute, but...","Brande is very beautiful, but this video is way too hokey. Nothing really erotic about her clips, very tame performance. It was kind of annoying that in a lot of the clips, Brande did the narration which screwed up the flow. 1 shower scene that Brande does is hot, but that was the only one that really turned me on. The first scene where she is the blonde bombshell trying to set some guy up for the paparazzi in a hotel room had lots of potential for fireworks, but was a big let down because the guy didn't even touch her. Oh well.....If you want a really steamy Playboy video, buy Wet & Wild 9 or the 2001 Playmate Video Calender. They are both much hotter....."
3,Typical PMOY video,"As with most Playmates of the Year, my favorite did not win again, but I got the video anyway. Brande Rodericke is average as Playmates go and she stars in an average PMOY video. Not that it's bad, there is just little that has not been done before. There is behind the scenes footage and Brande's original Playmate Profile in a bonus section. Buffy Tyler's Playmate Profile is include as well. If you're not a collector or serious fan, borrow or rent a copy before buying."
4,Does the job,"I'm glad I didn't pay attention to the negative reviews, because this worked out fine for me. It matches my bronze wall lamp and looks better than having the cord hanging down the wall, which really bugged me. It's not perfect, but it does the job. You do need to screw holes in the wall to attach it, but it's not a big deal to install."
3,Very cheap screws that strip out easily,Low quality screws so make sure you pre-drill! Nicely match the stained glass lamps as well. Need these to keep the kids from pulling the cords and lights off the wall.
4,"Zack, the Adventure Boy","Zack Files is about a boy who is 10 years old and a half. He goes to somewhere and experience many adventures. In this book, Zack went on a picnic with his classmates to Central Park in New York City. There, he accidentally shrunk. Everything he saw was huge including Queen Tut-ant-Kamen, the evil Pharaoh Queen.I like this book because it is enjoyable and has many adventures. Zack always has adventures in Zack Files. He meets everyone including spirits, people, and bugs. He solves his problems with interesting ideas.This book is written for 10~12 year olds who like adventures. As an ESL student, I like reading this book because it has many words that are common in society."
4,Good book!,"A linear combination of vectors allows any coefficient - positive or negative. A more powerful concept is the ""cone"" of a set of vectors which allows only positive combinations (more powerful because a linear space is the union of two cones, but a cone can never be expressed as a linear space). While there are many many good books on the ""algebra of linear spaces"" (i.e. Linear Algebra) I havent seen any that treat the ""algebra of cones"" with the thoroughness that this book does. I found this book useful to derive existence proofs in combinatorial optimization although the material is fundamental enough to be applied in many more fields. Best used if you have a reasonably good grasp of linear algebra."
5,Good Stuff!,"This is the best Deathlands book yet, and about damn time, too. The character's are finally becoming three-dimensional, instead of just the usual cardboard heroes who fear nothing. I was delighted to see Jak acting like an adult. In the Deathlands, 18 year old is an adult. Also nice to read a book by somebody who obviously knows weapons and what they can do. The cliffhanger at the end was terrif, and the book is chock full of clues as to who is really behind it all (not giving away the plot here). All in all, a damn good read. I'm looking forward to the next book eagerly. Kudos!"
1,Please don't let this writer do another book!,"I'm am an avid fan of the Deathlands series and own every book. If another is written like this one, it'll be the last I ever own as I will reread all the other before I'll read another as bad as this one. It's not the storyline, it's the characters. Did they all die and get replaced when I wasn't looking??? Jak drinking and womanizing, all the other characters sounding like something from a bad daytime soap opera.Please bring back the original characters."
1,Definitely not their best effort,"In fact, I'd say it's their worst. While I can listen to a couple songs off it, I don't go out of my way to do so. This is just overall a pretty bad album. After their last album (""Year of the Spider""), I knew this was coming. I hate to say it, but they're done. If you want to hear Cold when they were good, listen to ""13 Ways to Bleed Onstage"". I'd stay away from this one."
5,Cold STILL Awesome,"This CD is awesome, just as all their others have been. A true Cold fan will enjoy this CD. Their music has changed a little, but it definitely still has ""Cold"" written on it. Their style is theirs and it always will be. The music and Scooter's passion as he sings just makes you want to cry. It is truly another brilliant CD by Cold."
3,a big dissapointment,Ive been a fan of Cold since their self titled debut was released. The albums have gotten progressively better but this one took a nose dive. The lyrics are still there but the way the songs are put together were just not what I was expecting. The other releases are playable from beginning to end but when I play this one I find myself using the next button to get to one of the few songs on this album that I like. If you are a cold fan I recommend to buy it just because there are a couple songs that are tolerable. If you heard a new release on the radio and are thinking of giving them a try I recommend buying one of their previous three releases...
3,COld has lost the love,"Cold is one of favorite bands ever, but this cd, was the biggest let down. A lot of it had to do with the line up change an dmaybe the record label. COld has seemd to lost the grunge and heavyness, and has become a poppy radio-friendly sound. It seems the emo kids of now have more say in music. Scooter is still great but this cd lacks a lot of luster and the music just seems like it does not mesh and maybe its becasue we want old cold, but something is not right. This cd has has really 4 songs that stand out the rest just seems like new adema or soem other crappy radio band. I still feel it is worth owning but if you do not own a cold cd, skip this and buy 13 ways to bleed!!!!!!!!!!"
5,Bragg Organic Sprinkle Seasoning,So glad to find this product. I am always on the lookout for products to add flavor to my cooking since I have to watch my sodium intake so closely. I would highly recommend this spice combination to anyone and especially to those of us who must watch our sodium intake. I have now purchased this product again and will keep it in my pantry. You just would not believe how it can make soups and other dishes so flavorful but I think if you try it you will be very pleasantly surprised.
5,A mighty heroine,"A great book for showing girls as heroines and teaching about giving to others. A Native American folktale told by Native Americans adds to the richness of the story. Lends itself to several classroom studies including northern lights, heroes, folktales & legends, ladyslipper flowers and Native American culture."
4,Love this show,The two characters are so opposite....I want to know where is season two. I will be disappointed if there is not another episode
2,Tries too hard,"Surely there couldn't be a shallower PM than Hugh Grant's character. He doesn't have the social skills or the brain cells for the job. His crush isn't what most of us would consider love, actually. At the end of his segment she runs up to him in public and jumps on him with both legs wrapped around his waist. Look at Grant's face; he doesn't quite believe it himself.None of the relationships had time to ripen. The story tried to tie up all the segments into a nice Christmas pageant bow at the end, but it didn't quite work. And there are seriously depressing fates for 2 or 3 of these couples. Love, actually not."
5,"The best ""feel good"" movie","I just sent my two daughters the DVDs of Love Actually for Valentines Day. They both love the movie too. After watching it at least 15 times over the years, I can catch any scene and just watch it for five to 20 minutes in anticipation that the small time segment will make me feel more joyful and happier. I don't buy a lot of movies but I bought this one because it is so well done. Each venue blends into the next with such ease that you don't feel like it is manufactured. Hugh Grant, Colin Firth, Emma Thompson, Bill Nighy, Laura Linney, Liam Neeson, Kiera Knightly and all the other cast members are excellent dramatically and comedically. Love Actually is exactly that Love ....Actually."
5,Love Actually Review,This movie was heart-warming and all-encompassing. It didn't stray to pithy romance or overly dramatic saga. It is hard to leave the theatre being a pessimist. A Must-See.
3,Love Actually Editorialized,"This movie is entertaining and gives enough laughs throughout to make it bearable, but it could have used a serious dose of editing as, besides being very predictable for the most part, it just rambled on and on until you couldn't care less about any of the characters."
5,Love this movie !,This is one of our favorite christmas movies.The cast is great... It is a must for anyone's DVD/ blue ray library
4,Nice film,"Charming story. This is enjoyable for light entertainment. A bit disconnected but still a favorite. It is a ""chick film"" but that's OK."
2,Incredibly trite and boring,"""Love Actually"" is such a low-IQ movie that it actually insults the audience. It has everything that's wrong with today's movies -- a pretty-boy prime minister (no, Blair is not pretty, Huge Grant is), a modern-day cinderella, a stereotypical [...] man, a single father, an interracial couple -- and it tries too hard to be ""cute."" None of the stories is engaging and none of the characters really captures your heart -- unless you like to be insulted by the insolence of the filmmakers."
1,I Give It The Hairbrains Award,"This movie seemed to be more of a patchwork of poorly scripted, barely coherent flat characters. At times it seemed like a multi-cultural ad campaign put together by a dimwitted government agency that really doesn't understand any culture at all. Its sickening sentiments which substitute, mostly, for real love are a nightmare of shallow goop.It is, without a doubt, one of the worse films, with some of the best stars, that I've ever seen. One bright light was Emma Thompson. But then, she barely has to walk into a scene and she's already raised the bar for everyone involved."
5,Romantic and fun.,Art sure did mirror reality in this movie. Liam Neeson loses his wife in this movie and Emma Thompson's husband cheats on her in the film....talk about reality! It really happened to both of them! This movie is a joy to watch and the stories of the couples are fun to follow.You'll love it.
1,Tripe Actually,"A stellar cast is drawn together for...what? For the biggest load of tripe I've had the misfortune to sit through in a long time.Hmmm...Romantic COMEDY? Laugh...I thought I'd never start - and I was not wrong. Not a chuckle, not a titter was raised. Humour of the middle-class dinner party variety doesn't work for me. Lame, obvious jokes and cartoon characters abound. ""Common as muck"" Natalie swears in front of the ""upper-crust"" Prime Minister and we're supposed to find it funny? Charming? Believable??? PREPOSTEROUS?!LOVE? If Richard Curtis thinks his threadbare characterizations and superficial plot lines constitute or represent love in any meaningful way then he is bonkers, actually.If Disney made movies for the adult market then this is what they'd come up with. Utter rubbish."
4,"An ""It's A Wonderful Life"" for the 2000s","There were many epics released in 2003, Cold Mountain, Return of the King, and Big Fish, but none was more unexpected than the Romantic Comedy ""Epic"" Love Actually. Set in charming merry old England at Christmas time, Love Actually, brought forth holiday chher like no other film in the holiday season. You leave the theater, wanting to fall in love with someone. The film brought together great British acting, which included Emma Thompson, Liam Neeson, Colin Firth, and OMG Keira Knightly. It all came together in a not so tiring 2 1/2 hours. See it for a feel good time."
3,Decent Chick Flick,"It was a decent chick flick to watch with an SO. It was pretty confusing trying to keep track of all the different people and their stories.Received a 63% on rotten tomatoes, which I agree with."
1,Can they cheapen the idea of love anymore?,"Okay, I love most british films, most romantic comedies, and find often something redeeming in the ones I don't. This movie is a huge disappointment. I was drawn in by the great actors, but I wonder what drew them in. This movie has weak story lines, mostly unlikeable characters and uses every opportunity to include foul language, sex and nudity it can. The effectual message? Love Actually is Cheap."
2,A lot less than I expected,There were a few funny moments and a few aaahhh moments but they were few and far between. The boredom in between and the grade school potty humor were much more noticeable. Try to rent it if you want to see it. Not worth buying.
3,Not a serious movie,"This movie has a lot of different storylines that are difficult to keep track of.Parts of it are very, very funny. The sex scenes with the porn star actors are hysterical. The completely unrealistic scene with the Brit boy in Milwaukee is quite funny as well.Some scenes are sad--such as the scene with the woman in love with her coworker, who almost ""shags"" him but can't make herself ignore the ringing phone when it's her mentally ill brother.The kid whose stepfather goes with him to ""get the s**t kicked out of him by love"" is ADORABLE. I hope he stars in more movies.I was brought to tears by the woman who discovered her husband might be cheating on her (...). I wish that storyline had been better developed.There are a lot of cheesy parts to the movie, yes, but I think it was supposed to be cheesy, not serious. So, overall I would recommend it. I think it's a good movie in the ""cheese"" genre."
1,LOVE ACTUALLY DID NOT ARRIVE,"We were unable to watch this movie because of password problems. The process for resetting one's password is too difficult, especially when there's a party going on."
1,Where is this movie writer taking me to?(zero stars),"I loved notting hill, gave a lot to think about and everybody liked the ending.With this movie I was so disgusted with all the [profanity] it shows and no real interest in giving an uplifting view of what real love ought to be!We left the movie theater as soon as the sleezy part started with the bug-eyed english guy in the bar. I was begining to enjoy some of the other stories but why do you have to ""porn it up""?We went to see this movie because of the excellent actors, to bad for them they have to be associated with this material.I really hope nobody buys this DVD so that hollywood sees that people are more interested in less ephimeral things.Go see the PASSION instead."
5,"If They Gave Acadamy Awards for ""Most Enjoyable"" Film...","...this movie would be my choice for 2003. It's a perfect ""forget your troubles"" kind of film with a cast so good and characters so likeable it's no effort at all to suspend your disbelief and emotionally dive right in. That's not to say it's complete fluff; the message (a lesson on the myriad forms, stages and costs of love) is very real and very important, but it's delivered with a spoonful of sugar rather than a syringe. A highly recommended antidote to the cynicism one is apt to pick up while doing the holiday shopping."
5,As good as in movie teathers,This edition of Love Actually is more than I expected. I had the chance to watch the movie on theater when it was released but is one of those you've got to keep on your DVD collection
3,Very uneven movie,"The movie consists of quite a few sub-plots, where characters in which of them are somehow connected. The director put together great great actors but it seems like each sub-plot was directed by different person so uneven they are. It ranges from very funny stories of aging rock star or british guy going to Wisconsin because American girls like british guys, to cheesy story of relationship between father and son after the death of boy's mother, to totally predictable story of love of british prime minister (played by Hugh Grant) to the lady on his stuff. Hugh Grant, by the way, again disappoints: he just plays the same kind of character he played in many other movies. Overall, great actors shooting blanks in many cases."
3,"Good Xmas feeling, but OTT sympathy and too many characters","I just saw this film in the cinema and yeah it is one of those films that everybody who is in the festive spirits will enjoy at the time but that is all really. It is nothing memorable, just sort of a 2 hour xmas time filler to get ya in the mood.The premise is simple. Various persons each have a crisis love situation around xmas time and then eventually it tries to all come together. There is a lot of diversity in the various stories and it is very moochy, kissy, awww---shucks, kind of stuff. So take your girl to see it and I am sure she will be happy for the next few hours after it, but the film does lash on a bit with the whole emotion of love sort of premise that it is born out from.The scenes with the aging old rocker are worth the admission fee alone. Just do not go in expecting a grade A comedy and you will enjoy your two hours."
2,Mixed Emotions,"Hmmm. I am feeling like a voice in the wilderness. I like many things about this movie which shows different incarnations of love. What upset me is the portrayal of the schizophrenic brother of Laura Linney's character. In my opinion, he is an extreme case and the portrayal is scary. It perpetuates the stigma to the public and sends a message (so strong in visual media) of hopelessness to individuals suffering from mental illness and to their families as well, who already bear such a heavy burden. The writer could have portrayed this character as being out of the hospital, on the way to recovery, etc. It was just so disappointing, especially as so much of the film is well written."
3,Which is actually love?,"When I first watched this movie I thought it was just more tripe from the Hollywood movie machine. But, after watching it again, I developed my own theory about film: Some of the relationships presented are truly love and others are something else - infatuation, lust, selfishness, etc. Love is a sincere gift of self - YOU watch this movie and decide - which is love and which is not."
3,The Mother of All Romantic Comedies,"I will be the first to admit that I don't really like romantic comedies all that much. They tug at our heart strings, make us sick to our stomachs, and leave us dripping in sacharine sweetness. LOVE ACTUALLY is no exception to the mix. In fact, this film seems to be a romantic comedy on steroids, combining the Hollywood happiness of several movies into a single extravaganza. Throughout the film, we are treated to many interweaving storylines of love.Although I found the film to be a bit too sweet for my tooth, I did enjoy watching the storylines overlap one another and I was entertained. Despite the film's length, I found myself interested in a couple of the storylines in particular..like that of Billy Mack, a cynical rock star who steals every scene he is in.LOVE ACTUALLY is neither a great film nor a terrible one. It is an average film. No more, no less. Not worth a buy...but perhaps a look."
1,Like poo,"My girlfriend rented this movie, and it's one of the worst I've seen. Hugh Grant is a terrible actor and I knew that this movie would blow right when I saw that he was in it.This movie doesn't really have a set story or setting. It's just an annoying back-and-forth flick between different people's love life. I am very upset that I actually sat through this horrid film."
1,"sucked, actually","a bitter disappointment. like getting coal for christmas. the plot was flatter than the DVD itself, and the characters were cliches with british accents."
1,"Hated it, actually","Maybe I missed something, but what exactly was this movie about? None of the characters were ever on scene long enough for me to develop any empathy toward them, none of them were drawn with the slightest bit of realism or depth (except for maybe the washed-up singer), and none of the situations were the slightest bit believable.The entire sequence with the ""prime minister"" meeting the ""president"" was utterly pointless and added nothing to the movie. But then, that pretty much describes every other scene so I guess it fit right in.Like ""Four Weddings and a Funeral,"" this movie was pointless, meandering, unfocused drivel and a complete waste of film. I'd give it zero stars if I could."
3,Darkman 3 is a must see!,This film is great. Arnold Vosloo didn't get an award for this???? What's up with that?!?!? He does a great job and should be action hero of the year for 1996! This was not only the best Darkman film of all time...but the best action film off all time. Check it out Mack Daddy!
3,"""Darkman"" Has Potential as TV Show...","Lets stop making lame sequels boys and girls. I mean this isn't a real bad sequel, but they are getting lamer. Why not slow it down, and turn it into a TV series. It would be exciting and different from anything else on the boob tube. Jeff Fahey is always welcome in any movie, but doesn't have the menacing premise that Larry Drake had. Still, loaded with lottsa action and suspense. Good special effects enhance the story, and lets face it, you need this one to complete the set."
3,Interesting read,"This book lives up to its claim of being concise and easy-to-read but if you're looking to learn about medical statistics this isn't the right book. I'm a med student and this book didn't help me understand medical statistics. It is an interesting read, however, and I would recommend it just for that reason."
5,A thoughtful view of the city,"Robert Cameron's book, ""Above New York"", is one of the best photographic books that I've seen in recent years. Some areas of the city are chronicled from an historic perspective, while other areas are displayed in their modern beauty. I appreciate the juxtaposition of the older photos with their more modern counterparts.His views of downtown are especially well-done, and in light of recent times, it was a comfort to see the skyline in the traditional beauty. The view of the Twin Towers rising from the battery with Lady Liberty in the foreground seems especially meaningful in these times when our freedom seems threatened."
2,"Love the story, but too short","I have read one of theother books written by this author, and loved them, so I thought I would read this one as well. The story was very good. The wording was put a little too simply, but it was an overall good book. It kept me interested, and I didn't put it down until I was done. The only problem was that it was very short, and ended too abruptly. The story didn't exactly end. I would have liked to hear more about what happens to The Moochers. Seeing some sort of conflict would have been nice."
2,Disappointing And Without Consistence,"Why on Earth was this film cheered from all sides? The story is very vague, the direction is weak, and the film as such lacks consistence. A level which only belongs to debut films.A typical Danish film, for good and for worse, but especially for worse. Mediocre acting, except of course by Sofie Grbl who, no matter how tiny a role she is given, just does not posess the talent of adapting.A disappointing film whose only good sides are Iben Hjejle, Jesper Asholt, my favourite psychopath Torben Jensen, and a few OK jokes here and there thanks to author Anders Thomas Jensen.By the way: What word in the 'Dogma 95' has Sren Kragh-Jacobsen followed?"
1,Music that desecrates the Misfits,"This CD is terrible. I hate that corporate sellouts are using music that is by definition, anti-corporate, pure-blooded punk. The remakes of classic Misfits songs by these sellout hacks makes me want to kill.The bands on this CD have done a disservice to punks everywhere and their music shows it. If you want to hear some remixes of Misfits songs then I would suggest looking elsewhere. This CD is not punk, it's Ska, and EMO, and CRAP. DO NOT BUY THIS CD. The day that I bought it, I listened to it, then took it to a CD/Game exchange and sold it, the very same day. Don't waste your time or money."
5,"REALLY COOL, DIFFERENT","This tribute is very cool. From Pennywise's speed-punk version of ""Astro Zombies"", to Shades Apart's traditional-sounding ""20 Eyes"", to Prong's dark interpretation of ""London Dungeon"", to Earth Crisis' extreme version of ""Earth A.D."", this cd rocks! I'm not really sure how to feel about NoFx's cover of ""Last Caress"". One part sounds like Greenday, another reminds me of Sublime, and the end sounds like traditional Misfits. Snapcase's cover of ""She"" is pretty cool. It has extreme instrumentation, brutal vocals, but still stays punk. Deadguy's ""Horror Business"", Goldfinger's ""Ghouls Night Out"" and 108's ""Death Comes Ripping"" are also very good. If you are just into old school Misfits, and not into modern punk, this is probably not for you. If you like old and new school Misfits and modern punk, then you'll probably like it."
5,Wonderful book,"This is simply the best book on the mass media that I have read. It does a terrific job of covering academic research while maintaining its appeal to a general audience. The chapter on the effects of the media are powerful examples of what good sociology can be. If you want to increase your understanding of the internal workings of media industries and the effects of the mass media on the individual and society, you couldn't make a better choice."
3,"I remember this on HBO yrs ago,","The leader of a band of outlaws is betrayed by his second in command who takes his place as the band's leader. The rest of the movie consists of the old leader helping a posse track down his old buddies. Good story. The acting was hit and miss, sometimes good, sometimes bad."
3,Not bad.....But,"This seemed like a sure-fire hit, and it could have been, except for two things:Rourke's makeup and costumes are almost laughable. The stupid mustache, the big, floppy hat, and ten layers of clothes in the hot summer plains are ridiculous! The makeup and costume guys should be selling used cars.Second, the final scene was ludicrously short, bloodless, and unbelievable, especially given the bloody action that proceeded it. Someone please explain to the man who directed this film about the velocity and deadliness of small handguns.Still, it's worth watching just for Rourke and Mulroney. Rourke is THE quintessential bad guy, and he plays it to the hilt, here. Muldoney is always good, no matter what role he plays. The supporting cast is great, too, so it's not a complete wash-out!"
5,a personal reference or periodic motivation,The previous reviews summarize my general feelings about this fine work. I would like to add that I've found the book very useful as a reference. As I read the book over and over I make notes and keep a personal index which allows me to browse the book easily when dealing with a particular issue in my practice. Rereading a pertinent section provides insight and gives me another resource.
2,OK....Way too expensive!,"Overall, this reference book makes it easy to use proper documentation in papers. However, [the price] is too expensive for this book especially since it does not contain a complete listing of MLA documentation... If you are not new to writing papers, and just need a reference book for documentation, the MLA handbook is much cheaper and gives you everything you need."
5,Dare To Listen,"The Human League were purveyors of the synth-pop movement of the early 80's and Dare is their landmark album. The album would be worth buying for ""Don't You Want Me"" alone. The song is an 80's (and all time) classic with its film noir lyrics and rich synthesizers. One might think of the album as a one-song wonder, but that is hardly the case. Other great tracks include ""The Sound Of The Crowd"", ""Get Carter"", ""Things That Dreams Are Made Of"", ""Love Action"" & ""Seconds"". The three-pronged vocals and dueling synths create a moody, electric piece of music."
2,Monotone.,"I love monotone music. Listening to a cd for the sake hearing one song over and over, hot damn. Reading reviews by other people, I get an odd overview of the album. It is the best album to come out of the eighties, because it has one good song. That one song being ""Don't you want me"", which nearly 25 years later is still overplayed. With the amazing skills that HL had, it's a wonder that they aren't still around.(note the sarcasm)"
3,Ehh!,"It was an ok read. Not what I expected. This book was written long, long ago and I guess reading it now it resembled allot to The Hunger Games which threw me a bit. The story took its on we'll through half of the book. I don't know I connected with Rod right away, but I can't say the same for the rest of the characters."
5,One of the finest books on the history of science,"This is one of the finest books on the history of science I have ever read. Each scientist appears larger than life - even their warts and flaws are the size of mountains. This is the history of chemistry told on the large screen, technicolor, and surround sound, as heroic as any military or political history. I'll be re-reading this book 20 years from now."
4,Great demonstrator for adiabatic principle,"This is not a toy; the plastic column has 1/4"" thick walls and the piston is 5/16"" steel. There are no piezo crystals, batteries or flints to go bad... it just uses air compression. Arbor Scientific has another great science product from Americian Scientific for classroom or home use.The 'fire syringe' comes with enough raw cotton wool for about a dozen demonstrations. Instructions tell you to dry the inside of the tube with a bit of paper towel (rolled up) before using it. **The cotton will not ignite if you don't.** Not all cotton balls are cotton; look for the 'cotton bud' label on your package.Before each use: check that the knob on top is tight. You have to pound on that with the palm of your hand; you don't want the threads getting stripped. After many uses lubricate the O rings with silicon oil to keep them from wearing (you get a spare set). Using a bit of cotton the size of a BB seems to make the most satisfying flash!"
3,Zire 71 Aluminum Hard Case,"Couldn't believe how fast this arrived!! Ordered it on June 21, received email from supplier that he had sent it by mail on the 22nd, and I received it on June 24. Wonderful service!! It was used and the case was pretty scratched but at least it will protect my Zire 71. I've emailed supplier to see if he can tell me if the stylus will fit anywhere within this case. Was very satisfied with this supplier."
3,Good but not great,"This case is great in almost every way. Very durable, sleek, holds the Palm securely and all the things you would want a protective case to do. There are two shortcomings. The first is that the power button is exposed, which means it can be turned on by accident. The second is that although in the description it says the IR port is open for easy transfer, you can't hot-sync it in a cradle without taking it out of the case. That's a real pain."
2,"Adds bulk, not totally expandable","This is a great product if you don't mind adding some bulk to your Zire 71, but it was bulkier than I had expected.The product description says your PDA is fully expandable within the case, but that's only partly true. You cannot fit an encased Zire 71 into the hotsync cradle. The thin foam padding also seems to push the Zire 71 a little out of alignment with the cutout slot for the Universal Connector, so I'm not sure if you could plug in a free cable into the bottom of an encased PDA (though I haven't tested that)."
3,Watch out for the belt clip,"While the case is great,(it saved the Zire 71 from serious damage) the screw that attaches the case to the belt clip is a bust it fell off while I was on my bike in traffic. The case bounced twice and opened, dent in the case and scratch on the palm zire. I no longer trust it, it now rides in a pocket. I also can't charge it while in the case."
4,a VERY good will out,"Picture this... a baseball game between oasis and the verve and radiohead is umpiring. That's embrace. I love his voice. The songs took me a while to get into but now I can't live without them! The production is kinda messy. The songs sound very busy and noisy, which is cool for a while, but my ears get tired out more quickly as a result. I would definately recomend this record to radiohead and oasis fans."
4,Good overview,"In this book, Dr. Liebowitz provides an overview of contemporary thought about how organizations can acquire and maintain intelligence. The book provides some good ideas on how one might actually go about improving the OI where one works. However, the tools provided in the book (almost 1/2 the content) are not available electronically - most unfortunate, since they represent about half the value of the book."
4,great book,The book is very detailed and has a lot of good suggestions. Just need a lot of patience in the beginning.
5,great handbook,I am a certified massage therapist and infant massage instructor. I suggest this book to many of my clients because it is easy to read but also detailed enough to leave the reader well informed. The methods described by McClure are widely accepted. A must read for anyone involved with the daily care of young children.
2,DIDN'T GET TO WATCH IT...,"I WISH THEY HAD A SEPARATE RATING SCALE FOR SHIPPING FROM THE PRODUCT ITSELF. THIS MOVIE IS AWESOME...HENCE THE REASON I WAS PURCHASING IT. IF YOU GET A CHANCE...RENT IT, BUY IT, BORROW IT, SEE IT. IT IS A TRULEY GREAT MOVIE.WHEN I RECEIVED THE DVD SENT TO ME THOUGH, IT HAD TO GO IN THE TRASH...WHICH WAS A BUMMER. THE MOVIE ARRIVED BENT SO IT WOULD NOT PLAY.SHIPPING POOR....MOVIE EXCELLENT.I'M SURE I COULD HAVE SENT IT BACK, AS AMAZON IS REALLY GOOD ABOUT THAT BUT I DIDN'T WHICH WAS MY BAD."
5,one of those great movies you always remember,"my husband likes to quote from Movies and this is one of them. we both remember it from our childhoods and wanted to share it with our kids. a story about being 12, two days out of a life adventure and heartache.I highly recommend it for anyone that wants to teach thier kids about friendship."
5,A different experience from when I first watched Stand By Me as a child,"The wonderful film, Stand By Me, added so many more nuances to the Stephen King novella on which it was based. When I first saw it as a child, I loved it, even though there were moments that genuinely frightened me. Watching it on blu-ray now is a whole new experience - the dynamics of the relationships between the four boys, moments of sadness, moments of hope, and yes, still some moments of fear.This blu-ray 25th anniversary includes commentary from the now adult actors Wil Wheaton and Corey Feldman. I only wish that River Phoenix was alive today to have taken part and so that we could have seen how his acting would have developed in his adulthood. Fortunately, we have this lovely film to give us an idea of what could have been."
5,Watch it!,"This is a fantastic and inspirational film, in actual fact my favourite film of all time. The actors are all extremely talented and they act their parts convincingly. There are some funny one-liners which make the overall drama of the film JUST bearable. Of course, River Phoenix is gorgeous and excellent in this film. I would strongly recommmend anyone to see this film. The ending is quite depressing, even tear-jerking, and is possibly not for the faint hearted. Hey I should be a critic..."
4,Good sampler for a start,This CD has good tracks from otherwise no more available longplayers of Ashra/Manuel Goettsching (mainly guitar and synthesiser). The tracks are very moody and never trashy. Only the editing leaves much to be desired...
1,BUYER BEWARE! Watches hit glass when cover closed!,"What a dissapointment! Aesthetically, this box is gorgeous and well made for the money. It has the potential to be an excellent value, BUT there is one GLARING ISSUE. Mainly, there is not enough room or clearance between the glass cover and watch face, and the drawer and watch face when using the 'display pillows' to display many typical average sized watches! And you can forget about storing a larger 'Lupah' type watch in this box, if you want to use the display pillows. Whoever designed this box obviously didn't take watch size into consideration. Maybe if smaller 'display pillows' were provided, the problem might be alleviated. I would have easily given the product a 5 star rating if the watches fit properly."
1,lousey print,lousey print will never buy off this seller again claimed it was in good condition it was not.
2,Stole sweetness,"Gently grating vocals paired with muted melodies and tourist techno, exploiting a sort of generic emo-prog, keep tame connections at bay."
4,adorable and so much fun,My daughter is 4 and myy sister bought this for her for christmas- yes it does take a bit to set it up- some pieces are a little flimsy but really only until it is installed properly BUT it is sooooooooooooo much fun and it is very adorable- I loved it so much me and my husband played for hours with her and were laughing and it is just awesome- she got a ton but this was her favorite and I have to say mine too- she did buy us the extra case with all the cars and all so 10 at a time is fun like the other person said and they just keep going- so so fun!!!!! thanks for making racetracks and cars for girls
1,Buyer Beware,"We bought this last year for our 5 yr.olds Santa present. We could not get it to work. The idea is good- for girls.. But it is worthless and made my daughter cry because it would not stay together.Later this year we bought a Darda race track- for B-day present and to make up for the the dissapointment this one made... Easier to put together, (ask a ten year old to do it- us adults forget as we get older and instructions are confusing).. And actually works, without batteries. Even though it was not pink and purple, she loved it."
5,garfield totally rocks i love this book,garfield fans will love this materpeice written and illustrated by sir jim davis theres not much else to say except keep it up jimbye mark fantastic jones
4,Canon Quality at a discount price.,"Price is less than the big box stores, using Canon quality for an expensive little Cannon Printer is worth it."
3,Their Formative Years,"On Obscure Alternatives, Japan had not yet matured into the great band that recorded Tin Drum, by far their best record, but the seeds are in place. Even at this stage , Mick Karn's bass playing, though not yet fully evolved into his famous fretless style, is still creative and captivating. David Sylvian's vocals owe more to Ziggy era Bowie than Bryan Ferry on this album. The guitar is more in the mix and funky than it would be in the later band, which completely did away with it by Tin Drum. Somehow this group's albums never sound dated, aging much better than similar bands from this era. Obscure Alternatives is not a bad artifact from an emerging band."
1,Load Of Crap,"I like Metallica. As I've said before I consider myself an open-minded music fan, so therefore I am not afraid to say when albums and songs stink - even when they are done by artists I like. In my opinion Metallica makes great songs but so-so albums. With that said, after you listen to ""Fuel"" on this album, take the disc out of your CD player and reach for something else. The rest of the album is awful."
1,No more Metal in Metallica .... just 'POP',"I thought Load was bad, but this is worst. I'll give it 5 star for the POP & ALTERNATIVE music category...... Heavy/thrash metal ? Go back to pre-Black album. I bet in the next album they'll invite Spice Girls to join them singing....la, la, la.... Go and listen to Megadeth !"
3,What happened?,"Man, they used to have what it takes but they are lossing it. What happened to the Heavy Metal, Long hair, great songs and feeling filled lyrics???? I hope this is a phase because if it ain't they are going to go for a bad crash in the near future."
1,You've got to be joking,"After Load, I honestly wasn't expecting that much. Not that Load was a horrible album, it just didn't grab me like previous efforts. But really, this album has blown away all expectations! ...Metallica should've left this ... unreleased and buried. What a horrid listening experience! Now I'm not saying it ... cause it isn't as heavy as Puppets, etc. It just ... because its a bad album! Bad songwriting, bad solos, bad performances, baaaaad! Stay away..PLEASE!"
2,half cocked,"Don't kid yourself, Metallica knew which songs were good from teh load sessions and put them on load. 3 songs on this album are actually 20-40% worth listening to, the rest are pure trash.I also hated that the booklet was just someone's idea of artistry, instead of lyrics, and credits and band photos that had been standard fair before. Do we really need a second cover in a row designed with blood and bull semen? if you don't believe that's what it it, read the articles around when it was released. This just proves someone was out of their head to release this trash."
4,not the best but pretty good,(...) it might not be their best album but it is brill compared to the crap on todays radio. metallica are as good as ever only people expect too much from them. think of all the songs they wrote. most bands cant stay around for more than a few years unlike metallica (almost 20 years)! METALLICA ROCK!!!
2,Possibly one of the worst,"This is only slightly better than Load and slightly worse thanthe black lp which in my opinion was the begining of the endof Metallica. The first song rocks and then drifts off into meandering, senseless grunge with elements of southern rock(?)wtf? Did I miss something? Sorry Metallica fans this record bores me to death..."
3,Not Their Best,"I bought this album expecting an improvement from load, and thought it was a slight one. Metallica was around before i was but i have thoroughly enjoyed their music. I own this and Kill em All. Kill em All is a [heckuva] lot better. This album starts out rockin with Fuel, which rocks super hard. It declines from their, so stick with the old stuff...."
2,it ok,"This cd doesnt totally suck, but its not great. I started out listening to the black album, which I thought was cool, but then I listened to the older stufff, and that kicked @$$! This and Load are too mellow compared to the old albums... but compared to some other crap that we hear on the radio, they're not bad."
1,Where is Metallica?,"Someone has definately kidnapped the Metallica of old because Reload is not them. Have they become extinct in metal and reborn in the lust of money? Fuel is the only song I can even say ""eh"" to. Not a bad song but give me a break. The only people that listen to them now are the top 40 idiots that will swallow anything the radio dishes out to them."
2,"Oh, please, someone call 9-1-1!!! Stop the bleeding!!!","No, not sell outs, just doing things different. And, doing them very bad. I thought Load was some kind of cruel, sick, bad joke... but, then there was this. And the nightmare continued. It's just not Metallica. Maybe it's a Samson and Delilah thing. If they grow their hair back, will they return to their hard rocking dominance? Can they ever regroup, literally, and claw their way back to the top where they used to be. ""Fuel"" is ok, Unforgiven II is preposterous and The Memory Remains is just wierd music. Metallica is not supposed to be wierd, they're Metallica, just ...in your face pounding, driving rock 'n' roll."
1,Will All Metallica Cheerleaders Please Talk About the Music?,All this talk about how Metallica does what they want to do and don't care what anybody thinks about it has NOTHING to do with the CD itself. I'll give it the proper review - this CD REEKS and there's no reason to listen to it when there's so much better music out there (include all Metallica albums until the Black or self-titled album).
3,i was wrong,"those of you who have seen my previous review will either disagree completely or think, ""hey, he's gotta point"". Well, I've changed my mind. Sure, it's certainly not the best album ever and not for everyone, and I will agree that 80's metal is generally better than 90's metal(take a look at two Iron Maiden songs, Aces High and Clansman. Clansman is sh*, largely because it was written 10 years later) but this is still a good album, and you can't deny that feul kicks a**. And take a look at bands like Nirvana and Offspring. Sure, they're grunge and not metal, but they are largey 90's bands. I would give it 3 and a half stars rather than 3, but it's not good enough to get 4. That said, it is a fairly good album, especially compared to all that modern Britpop (i have a 12 year old sister, I can't avoid it). Just, if you're new to MetallicA and have just bought this album, don't be put off (although Iron Maiden are better anyway);-)"
2,This Ain't Right...,"So, Metallica tried somthing new, and they called sell-outs. However, they did not sell out, they got old. And, in some cases that can be just as bad. Re-Load has two good songs on it. Fuel and Memory Remains. What is really eerie, is the Re-Load and Load, are Metallica's version of GNR's Use Your Illusion albums. Ballads laiden with riffs from hell. As I said Garage Inc. This sore thumb of an album signifies the loosning of Metallica's unearthly hold of this world."
1,Metallica makes limp bizkit look good.,"If you thought fred durst and limp bizkit was bad enough, then check out this awful follow up to the awful load, the plot has not been the same, poor instrument playing, and james hatfield's voice sound like an ox!, This is not metal, it is (...), if you want real metal listen to old metallica, reload is like justin timberlake of nsync says, Man i'm sick of that.Music Review: 1 Star."
2,Better than Load but not good enough,This album is better than the Load thing but still not enough Metallica.Far from being a good album.Unforgive II and Memory Remains can be considered as better than the other songs in the same album.
2,KINDA DISAPPOINTING,"This album really isn't all that great. The only good songs on it are The Memory Remains, Fuel, and Unforgiven II. The rest of the tracks suck....I'd say look for this CD in the used section of your local record store at a discounted price if you really want it. And you shouldn't have much trouble finding used copies of this."
1,This album REALLY SUCKS!,"What can I say? This album is a real let-down. That is unless your the average band-wagon, Top 40 music lover that gets your rocks off hearing Metallica songs on Kaisy Kaisem's Top 40 countdown every week. If you like cheesy glam-rock like Bush, you'll LOVE this album. Geez, I would have gotten more out of Pat Boone's Heavy Metal album......"
2,Metallica - 'Reload' (Elektra) 2 1/2 stars,"Review no.618.Somewhat disappointing follow-up to their '96 'Load' CD, which was one of their better works ever,I thought. I remember SO many fans commenting how let down they were when this disc first came out. It's not so terrible,it's just nothing to get all tanked up about. Some of the tracks here,I thought were okay,are ""The Memory Remains"" (love the video where Marianne Faithfull makes an appearance-now THAT'S semi-original),""The Unforgiven II"",the melodic ""Where The Wild Things Are"" and ""Bad Seed"". Not the worst metal release I've ever heard,by any means. Take my advise,buy a used copy of this title."
2,NO!!!! THEY WENT MAINSTREAM!,"I am really dissapointed in Metallica. How could they go mainstream? How!? Whatever happened to Ride the Lightning, And Justice for All, Kill Em' All, or Master of Puppets!! This album is full of repetitive, annoying songs like ""Fuel"" and ""The Memory Remains"" (the worst track Metallica ever created). Only a few songs such as Fixxer, Where the Wild Things Are, and Better Than You are likable. Unforgiven 2 is decent, but way too repetitive. And where are the guitar solos man? What the f#@%!!!! Metalheads, this album comes way short of being on the metal militia."
2,1 star for not changing band's name+1 star for effort=2stars,"Not their best.I'd say their worst.I wish I never bought and listened to this piece of ALTERNICA.I guess their next one will sound like BACKSTREETBOYS or something, what a pitty, they were so great...(METALLICA, I mean)"
2,GREAT???!!!,I DO NOT think that this is an excellent metallica album and I don't know what's wrong with someone who would reccomend this one.
2,MORE SUB-PAR MATERIAL FROM METALLICA,"THIS ALBUM DELIVERS MORE OF THE SAME SUB-PAR MATERIAL THAT WAS ON ''LOAD''. LIKE ''LOAD'', THE ALBUM STARTS OFF WELL. BUT, AFTER ABOUT THE FIRST 6 TRACKS OR SO, THE ALBUM JUST LOSES MUCH OF ITS EXCITEMENT. THIS IS METALLICA'S LOWEST ALBUM TO DATE. ''FUEL'' SURE DOES ROCK, THOUGH."
1,Sad,"This was one of the first albums I bought that I was dissapointed with. Load was better, and as back in Metallica albums you go, it gets better. ""Fuel"" is a fun song to listen and to play on guitar, but the rest is better left to rest. 'The Memory remains"" has some nice bluesy riffs, but it's more of a Creed song than a Metallica song. As the album goes by, you will the deception too. Soft rock fans will find this an interesting offer from Metallica with songs as ""The Unforgiven II"", not bad at all, in fact, very interesting to listen to. Highlights: ""Fuel"" not metal, but regardless a great tune. Lows: monothony of the rest of the album."
3,Shut up already,"Seriously.No one cares about your elitist sell-out rhetoric.Reload is a damn good album, though more along the lines of standard hard rock than the psychedelic/alternative sound of Load.Give it a try."
3,"Either 5 or 1 for most, but I'm in the middle.","With Reload, you either loved it or hated it. It's definately a part from classic Metallica, that's obvious. For hardcore fans, it's terrible. This album just lacks Metallica's famous powerful lyrics and heavy guitar riffs.For new metallica fans, this album seems great. It's a little more mellow than Load, and definately the black album.And for me, it's not great, but it's not terrible either. Fuel caught my attention. Unforgiven II was disappointing to say the least. It's definately a change for Metallica. I'm a big fan of their older stuff, and this takes some getting used to. I'm just in the middle."
2,What is this?,"Metallica has reached a low on this album that is only surpassed by St. Anger. Most of the songs are uninspired and monotonous. There are really only 3 good songs on the album (Fuel, The Memory Remains, The Unforgiven II) but even they are not typical Metallica songs from their trash days or even Load days. Above all what is up with The Unforgiven II? It sounds much like Unforgiven from the Black Album and has no apparent reason for being made. Another complaint is that the recording quality is subpar. Fuel seems to start off really weakly as do some of the other songs. And yet another complaint is the complete abandonment of powerful guitar rifts, instead we're left with 4 minute songs that exhibit a minimal of Metallica's legendary talent. I miss the true Metallica."
1,This album !!,"Every song sounds the same and it is Metallica's most uninspired work they've done, other than St. Anger. Metallica has not put out anything decent since the ""Black"" album, with a few songs from ""Load"" being an exception. Kill em All"" through ""Black"", A+. ""Load"", ""Reload"", and ""St. Anger"", F-. Do not buy this disc."
3,"They messed up on Load, they did better here.",Better but not by much. I despised all the songs on Load. ReLoad has two great songs in The Unforgiven 2 and Carpe Diem Baby. Even Fuel is okay but the rest is sub par at best. Screw this commercial turn and go back to the way they used to play like in Ride the Lightning.
3,Better to know what it is you are looking for...,"Beautiful pictures accompany the information. I felt as if it was a bit unorganized: No glossary for a quicker reference, and the common names were not used in the Contents section at the front. The information on each particular specimen was done in a very factual way. Too Biology text for me, but probably good for someone with more than a beginner/basic gardening knowledge. I did obtain some useful information with time."
4,El creador de La Pandilla ES el creador de Menudo,"Si, senores y senoras, por si no lo sabian. Edgardo creo y manejo La Pandilla. Fue SU idea que llevo a cabo. Pese a su popularidad, La Pandilla nunca paso del mercado hispano. Se compara con Menudo que fue un fenomeno MUNDIAL. La Pandilla fue un conejillo de indias."
2,Overrated.,"If it weren't for the astonishing reviews for this series (""telling someone what is great about Gene Wolfe's writing is like trying to tell someone what's great about Mozart's music..."") I probably would have stopped reading this book halfway through it. I've been reading sci-fi/fantasy for 25 years. During this time, I have grown to appreciate more literary works. Calde does in fact contain well written, at times transcendant passages, but the story itself is ludicrously overwrought and complex. Wolfe forgets that a good story, regardless of whether it is pulp or artistry, must entertain the reader. Calde was technically proficient, but cold and lifeless. After being mildly disappointed with the first two books, I have continued to read on, hoping that Wolfe's style would click with me. Unfortunately, it just didn't happen."
3,Simple synthpop,"The CD is pleasant synthpop, but I think this is the least interesting of my Iris CDs. Awakening is excellent, whereas this one is good, but not great. No song stands out in your mind or has you humming it late, there is nothing ""catchy"". Usually, when I get a new CD I listen and pull off a few songs for a playlist on my ipod. I was hardpressed to find a song I really wanted."
1,disappointing!,"Disconnect is one of my fave albums ever, so hopes were extremely high for this one, which is why I m all the more disappointed with Wrath- it just sounds so generic, like a million other Depeche Mode wannabes. The production has nothing of the shimmering quality of their Debut, it sounds clunky and heavy, and it is not helped by the unmemorable songs; like other people said in their reviews, I m hard pressed to find even one song that I like.I wish Iris all the success in the world, they have the potential to be an amazing band, and an important one to boot, but this direction just seems wrong- they went from being really special and unique to ""just another synthrock band"" in the space of an album."
5,Excellent book on JSP,"This is an excellent book on JSP. Covers almost all aspects. The biggest thing I liked about the book is the simplicity of examples to explain the concepts, particularly the case study on Model View Controller. I would give full rating to this book."
2,Complete reference to what?,"This book is terrible. The Complete Reference to JSP? If I wanted a book to explain the HTTP protocol, HTML forms and other non JSP topics I would have purchased another book. The examples are simplistic... Too simplistic.If your seriously trying to learn JSP find another more advanced book with real examples."
2,"Nein, danke","I bought this to show my German students, because my current Oktoberfest video is a little out of date. I was surprised to see ""Mature content"" on the back of the DVD, because that's no where on the product listing.I previewed the DVD and while the content was informative and interesting and the pictures of the people were great, the narrator mentioned beer so many times that it was ridiculous. I get that it's about a beer festival, but the narrator sounded like his sole purpose was to get as drunk as possible. A few times the narrator cussed.In short, this video isn't something I'd show my students and I'm not sure why else someone would buy this, if not for German students."
5,Premier Recording of Oboe Concerti,This collection is truly superb. Dame Edith Rothwell plays with panache and finesse. The remastering from original tapes is unmatched. This is a CD that no collector should be wihtout.
5,excellent,The book I ordered was received on time and in good condition. Excellent review. Would use again if need to.
4,Good guide to Maine's coast,This book had some really good hints on what to see by region and very good directions. Great tips on shooting and what to look for.
2,Good but not great,"The book is largely novice photography help and locations. I bought another lighthouse book (The Lighthouse Book: New England) which had much more detail on the lighthouses, and turn by turn directions to get there."
5,Loved it!!!,"Louis Sachar never fails to please readers!!! I fell down laughing reading his past books ('There's a Boy in the Girls' Bathroom!' and 'Sideways Stories from Wayside School'). 'Holes' has proven this author hasn't lost his talent! I'm 14 years old and I think it's one of the best books I've read in years! I recommend it to anyone, ages 10-15. Enjoy!"
5,The best children's book we read this year,The entire family was captivated by this interesting story--even my 14 year old son joined in out nightly reading sessions.
5,"We think it is a GREAT book,for all ages","Holes is a great story which we enjoyed a lot. It is strange and bizzare;getting your attention and keeping it. While there is humour and absurdity,there is also a deep understanding of loyalty and friendship. We recommend this book to people of all ages.This is a book thats definitely worth two thumbs up."
3,holes review,"Stanley Yelnats and his family of lower class hard workers had a curse put on their family a long time ago. Stanley's father cures stinky feet and he has the classic stay at home mom. One day while he was walking home from school he got hit by a pair of cleats that will change his day from that point on. Stanley winds up in court getting sentenced to jail or camp, and like any teenage boy would, he chose camp. He takes the bus to Camp Green Lake and meets the camp boys. One in particular stuck out to him. Zero, or Hector Zeronni who was the fastest hole digger but the quietest one also. But what he didn't know about Hector the warden and himself would change his wealth, life and families luck forever. Holes is a great book, read it and find out the family secret."
1,We hated this book!! My 10 year old thought it was awful!,We didn't get why this was an award winner. Very depressing and not at all funny. Don't waste your time when there are so many other good books to read!
3,holes,"For this book the appropiate age group would be like teenage because they would understand it better. They can picture themselves allready ibn jail and what its like. Little kids would think it would just be fun and games. That wouldn't get the point across. Well, the book starts of when stanely gets arrested. he gets sent to camp and has to dig holes. In the beginning of the book stanely doesn't get along with the over people there. Until he proves himselve to them. after that they treat stanely differently. Then something bad happened ,stanelys friend zero runsaway from camp. After that stanely loses trust in the camp and he ends up runing away from the camp. the moral of the book is to choose the right choices and to stand up for yourself."
4,Holes rating,I think this book was very intresting and adventurouis in many ways. I liked when they maked it sound very real and life like. It was a great book and i would recamand i to other people who liked adventures and mysterys.
3,The book of the holes.....,"THE BOOK""HOLES"" WAS AN ""O.K BOOK. THE BOOK WAS FAKE IN SOME PARTS AND REALISTIC IN OTHER WAYS. PERSONALLY, I THOUGHT THIS BOOK WAS INTERESTING TO READ. IT CAPTURES THE READER TO THE SITUATION AND KEEPS YOU INTERESTED IN THE STORY. IF YOU LIKE BOOKS THAT YOU HAVE TO FINISH IN ONE DAY OR YOU'LL BE SO INTERSTED THIS IS THE BOOK YOU WANT TO READ."
3,Holes,"I thought the book Holes was ok. There were some good parts and bad parts. Some of the good things in the story were, Stanley learned a lesson, he made a friend, he got in shape, and he saved a life. I also thought there were a lot of bad things in this story. Stanly had to go to Detention camp, he had to cover for the other boys like X-Ray and all the others. I wouldn't recommend this book beacuse it's an ok book but I would rather read a great book than an ok book."
5,Holes,"Holes is an excellent book!! It was funny and you don't know what will happen next in the story. Louis Sachar is a wonderful author. I'm glad I chose this book! Stanley, the main character in the story, is a boy who gets in trouble for ""stealing"" Clyde Livingston's shoes!! Stanley is sent to Camp Green Lake which doesn't have a lake! It's a camp where boys who have stolen things go ""to learn from their mistakes"". Stanley blames it all on his no-good-dirty-rotten-pig-stealing great-great-grandfather. While he's at camp, he finds a gold colored tube which he thinks is either a gun capsule or a lipstick tube but he's not sure. He goes on alot of adventures and finds out alot about his life, family, and his no-good-dirty-rotten-pig-stealing great-great-grandfather. But you will have to find out more about the book for yourself!! So READ THE BOOK!!!!!"
3,Holes,"The book holes is more or less a book for teens, not for those who consider themselves to be young adults. The main idea of the book is that a boy gets sent to juvenile camp for a crime he does not commit, then as punishment he and the other boys in the camp are forced to dig holes five feet deep by five feet wide. One of the main ideas that I notice is corruption in a corrections facility. All the guards seem to be corrupt, as well as the warden who is an evil woman for she is the reason for the digging. I can compare this story to a movie called the Shawshank Redemption.In it, a man is convicted for a crime he did not commit, the warden, the guards are corrupt, a person in the facility knows that he did it, and that person is sought after by the warden to be silenced. I recommend this book to readers who like books about kids who go from the bottom to the top."
4,Patrick's review of Holes,"If you like conflicts and drama then read Louis Sacher's award winning book HOLES! Holes is a good book for any age but perfect for a 4th grader like me. In the book the main character is Stanley Yelnats the forth. Stanley is sensitive, gets pick on, pushed around, and cursed. I like how Sacher made his flashbacks in the book to tell how explain Stanley's family story. Read the book to find out how Stanley made new friends and breaks the family curse!"
4,holes,"I think that the book Holes is the best book ever made.There are many lessons to be learned in this novel, like building character. Also things like learning how to cope with difficult situations and sometimes grownups aren't always right.Holes is a great book about adventure and making friends. I would recommend this book to any kid who likes adventure and a good time."
4,Deft,"""Holes"" really is a good book, especially for older boys. It has moments of odd humor and deft use of flashback and parallel stories. My one problem with it is the changing character of Mr. Pendanski the counselor, who starts out nice and suddenly becomes evil. But this is a very enjoyable read."
3,Holes by eat it!,"The book Holes was very good.Some things I didn't like about Holes was that it was weird because there were three different stories in one.Another thing I didn't like about the story was when Louis Sachar left you hanging at the end.Something I did like about the book was the saying, ""no-good-dirty-rotten-pig-stealing-great-great-grandfather."""
5,Inside The Book Holes,"This book is about Stanley Yelnats being accused of stealing shoes from an orphonage . He was sent to Camp Green Lake .

4,what I think of Holes book,I think holes book was kind of cool because at first I thougt it was going to be boring but then it got itsided and I liked it. Because when I heard were going to see the movie and Im going to see the movie because the book was fun to read it then see the movie. From a girl 11 year old at Nightingale School.
3,interesting,"Holes is an adventure story. It was about the adventure of a boy named Stanley. The story was very weird but interesting. It has all those weird characters in it, such as some boys named X-ray, zigzag and Zero; also the setting and descriptions were great. This story taught me how to not give up on hope no matter what kind bad conditions you have."
4,my review,"I thought this story was all right it could have been better. The problem with this story was that in certain situation it would be a comedy, and then quickly change into an action scene. It's a good book, but it's not the best book I read. The only thing I enjoy really was the characters they were describe clearly, and I could almost picture the way they looked."
5,This is the book of books!,This book is very well put together! Two Stories almost totally unrelated come together in the most interesting way. This book has the most wonderful ending of any book I've ever read. And that is a lot of books. I could read this book millions of times and never get board. This is a must for everyone!
2,holes,"HolesThis book is about a boy name Stanley Yelnats. He got blamed that he stole shoes. Then he has to go to a camp .he has to dig hole that are as big as his shovel every day. Then he has to go to a camp. He has to dig a hole that is as big as his shovel every day. Then he teaches a boy how to spell. Then Stanley and his friend ran away. If you want to know if they come back read the story holes.I like this book because the author put his felling in it, that is why I like it."
3,HOLES REVIEW,"Holes was an okay book. It was a book about a boy named Stanley Yelnats. He was accused of stealing a pair of sneakers. So he had to go to Camp Green Lake. At Camp Green Lake he had to dig holes to look for the treasure that the warden was looking for. One day he and his friend Zero ran away. Then they came back and dug a hole and found the treasure. Finally, they got to go home.By,Dana and Nikki"
5,REVIEW,This is one of my favorite books. It is so passionate. Louis Sachar is one of my favorite authors. I love Holes and There's A Boy In The Girl's Bathroom. I'd buy this if you are a pre teen. It's about a boy that was framed for stealing and sent to a juvenile justice camp. He meets new friends. He runs away and almost dies... I don't want to spoil for the rest so just buy it and see it for yourself.
5,What a great book!,"This is defintly a book worth reading! It is full ofimagination and is a very exciting book! I got the chance to readthis book with a few classmates and we all have very different personalities, but we all seemed to enjoy the book very much! I would suggest this book to children and even adults of all ages! If you are a parent, and you like to read books to your children, this would definitly be a first choice of mine, and once you start reading this fascinating book, you will know what I mean!"
5,absolutely delightful !,as i was reading this charmer i would stop & and look up & laugh as the connections fell into place -unfortunately i disturbed my cats sleep as i did so but all is forgiven as it should be for a book of this delightful nature -i will say no more except for READ THIS BOOK NO MATTER WHAT YOUR AGE & remember its okay to laugh out loud at wonderful juxtaposition & irony
4,samantha times,Hi my name is Sam I realy like this book because it gives you adventure & exitement I also like the person Stanly& Zero becausethay get along and care about each other andthey dont quit on each otherand are onest to one anatherthats why I like this book .
5,Holes,This is a really different and strange story but it also really good and fun to read. This young boy named Stanly goes to camp but it is a camp for bad kids. He has a job and that is to dig holes all day. All of the kids are afraid of the Warden of the camp because they have heard that she has killed kids. And Stanley wants to know why he has to dig holes with all the other kids. He figures out that they might be digging for treasure and that they only person who knows this is the warden of the camp. This is a really good book with a really good ending.
2,Dissapointing.,"I really like Louis Sachar's books, but this is a mistake.... I read this in 2 days. Boring, actually. The book is about a kid who goes to juvenile hall because he stole some athlete's sneakers. The flashbacks in the book are really boring. The most intresting charecter, the warden, was hardly focused on. Please, don't waste your time."
5,A Must Read!!!,"I didn't think that this book would be that great but once I started reading it, it really captivated me. All the stories that somehow have some connection to the main story line intrigued me. Sachar tells the reader enough to keep them wanting to know the rest of the story all throughout the book."
4,do you want to read a great book?,Holes was a great book for kids but I would not recommened it to an adult because it is not challenging enough.It is the perfect book for a kid who loves adventures becaude in this book Stanley Yelnats and Zero go on a major journey after Zero gets into a tangle with the camp counciler Mr. Pendanski. Zero ends up running away from Camp Green Lake and after a few days Stanley decides to go help Zero and make sure that he was still alive and well. When Stanley plans to run away to find Zero he tries to steal Mr.Sir's water truck but ends up driving it in to a hole and has to find Zero on foot.When he finds Zero God's Thumb is now there destination and they have to make it there soon if they want to survive.The whole rest of the book is basicley about Stanley and Zeros journey to Gods Thumb and then back to Camp Green Lake to find Kissing Kate Barlow's barried treasure.Now to sum it all up somebody at Camp Green Lake ends up living a happy and VERY wealthy life.
3,A little strange.....,"This novel was truly a little strange, but that is why I kept reading it. It was mysterious, and I had to find out what happened."
4,Holes,"This book is about a boy named Stanley who ends up going to detention camp for stealing a pair of famous shoes. When he gets there he's always alone later he haves friends and finds something mysterious.If I was tv reporter and had a chance to ask Stanley a few questions I would ask how he felt the first time at camp,what he would do he decided to run away and he could have done if he wasn't there but knew everything so he could help the other boys. It would be interesting to know his answers to these questions.In the future I imagine Stanley being rich for finding a treasure. When he is rich all of his friends would live with him and be living the life of luxury, but the bad guys would return to steal Stanley's treasure.This book is interesting because the makes it feel we're there. I enjoyed this book because I can relate some of the events to my life and awesome what he does to get out of the camp. I think this book is cool and people who like adventure will enjoy Holes."
2,O.K. not the best,the wayside school series was way better. I suggest the wayside school series instead of holes
4,Holes,"Holes, Holes, Holes! Stanley Yelnats has been sent to a boy's detention center, Camp Green Lake, where the boys spend all their time digging holes 5ft.deep and 5ft.wide. Camp Green Lake has no lake, but an awful lot of holes. There's a secret behind Camp Green Lake. The kids are digging holes because the Warden is searching for something. If you like funny books, then I suggest you read this one."
4,Read this or pay the price,This is a very good book. I've read it so many times that I could recite it. The book I'm talking about is called Holes by Louis Sachar. this epic adventure is about a boy named Stanley Yelnats. He was mistaken to have done a crime which he really didn't do. He was taken to a labor camp. But this wasn't just any labor camp. This camp made boys dig holes five feet deep and five feet wide. They had to dig at least one hole every day. I hope you read this book because you will like it.
3,HOLES,I like the book but when Stanley goes to find Zero my rating goes down hill.It also is confusing when he switches back and forth between Stanley and his great-grandfather.I know youmight know that It is a BOB(battle of books)and that It is soon to be in theaters.CHOW!
4,Our class loved Holes!,Our fifth-grade class listened to Holes as a read-aloud. It was one of the most interesting and exciting books we've ever read. Some of us bought the book before our teacher even finished reading it to us. We loved the author's sense of humor and the weird nicknames and names of characters in the book. Holes was like a big puzzle that kept us guessing until the very end. We loved to predict what was going to be revealed next. We never wanted the teacher to stop reading.
3,HOLES REVIEW,"I had to read the book Holes in reading class. It was about a boy named Stanley Yelnats that didn't do a crime but they still blamed him for it.He had to go to Camp Green Lake and dig holes. If he he found things he had to take to the warden. If the warden liked it, she would give them the rest of the day off. Why I didn't like this book is because it wasn't my kind of book to read. But I think the movie was great."
4,"Classy, inventive, youth fiction. Good stuff!","Louis Sachar has obviously studied at the feet of writers like Roald Dahl and the German Grimm brothers, and has obviously learned his lessons well.With the narrative bouncing around between multiple time periods, Sachar manages to unfold a tale that's alternatingly funny, dark, sweet, and dangerous. This is the kind of book to read with your kids--so they don't miss anything, and so they can work through some of the scarier portions.I appreciate a story that deals so eloquently with the arid hearts of the racially prejudiced without soapboxing. Stanley is a fine everyboy whose courage ends up suiting him well. Perhaps my only (slim) complaint is the jumps in tone. Some portions play off as goofy that the transition back into the hard, hot land of Camp Green Lake is shocking. Or perhaps that's the point--you can't always remain in the fairy tale, even in a fairy tale.Highly recommended."
5,Holes a wonderful book,"Holes is a great book. I think you will like the book also. When I was reading I couldn't put the book down because it is so good. The book is about Stanley Yelnats who goes to a Camp for "" bad boys."" Stanley steals a pair of shoes. The story is a story within a story. You don't understand understand that because you have to read the book. It is a mystery and adventure book. You meet a lot of different characters. So I think you will love the book."
3,Holes by Luis Sachar,"Holes is a book about a young boy named Stanley who is unjustly sentenced to a detention camp for stealing sneakers.The detention camp is supposed to help Stanley build character.Eventually Stanley finds out that there's another motive to the camp,and that's where the adventure begin's. In my opinion this book is a great way for a young kid to read about crime,punishment and deception."
4,Rio's Review,"Holes is a great story of heroes and foes. There is more than opne story in Holes--it's a story-within-a-story-within-a story. When you read it, you will be amazed at all of the twists and turns Louis Sachar puts together to make you feel as if you are there, in Camp Green Lake, digging a five-foot by five-foot hole. I will admit, that every time you realize something, you gasp as though you had just finished a puzzle that you have been working on for a year. It's just a really, really good book!"
3,"Holes, A Story Within A Story","I liked Holes.The characters are really funny and sometimes really mean. The story is about a boy named Stanley Yelnats who is cursed by his no-good-dirty-rotten-pig-stealing-great-great-grandfather and gets in alot of trouble. He was in the wrong place at the wrong time.I didn't like Holes. There are alot of mysteries in the book. The author (Louis Sachar) doesn't explain any of them. The book gets very dull sometimes.The story is about a camp called Camp Green Lake where you are forced to dig holes that are exactly 5 feet wide and 5 feet deep. they have to dig holes so that the Warden can find her treasure. At the end of the story, the camp is shut down because of misbehavior from the staff. That is about as much as I could tell you."
4,I like Eggs and the book Holes,"I liked the book Holes. It left me hanging every chapter. My favorite character is the yellow spotted lizards. My favorite line is ""this isn't a girl scout camp"". It was kind of confusing because it was a story within a story within a story. I recomend this book to people who like to read or like action and humor.byEggheadedchicken104"
4,A good book,"This book was a good page turner, witha very good plot. You'll read past your bed time with it, because it's a defenately a page turner."
5,The best book i have ever read,I thought Holes was o good book because it gave you a good description of the characters and esp. the setting of the story. Holes was about a boy named Stanley Yelnats who thinks that he is cursed because of his grandfather and has since followed generations of Yelnats. Because of the curse he got sent to Camp Green Lake because he stole a pair of shoes which he really didn't do. So has he's at Camp Green Lake he uncovers many secrets that unfold about his grandfather. While he's at Camp Green Lake he uncovers that the Warden of Camp Green Lake is a very bad person. You will find out the rest! Very interesting book.
2,6th grader,"The story was okay but I wouldn`t really recommend it. My favorite charactor was Kate because she is brave and has a lot of heart. My favorite line is when Sam says, ""I can fix that""because he cares about Kate and would do anything to make her happy. The strong points are when Stanley and Zero are always there for each other. The weak point is when Elya is in love with a woman who has a head as empty as a flowerpot! Though I didn` t like the book, maybe you would!"
5,Holes,"Holes is the best book I have ever read, because it is exciting and you don't know if Stanley Yelants will ever get out of Camp Green Lake. The author is Louis Sachar. He has also writen ""Stanley Yelnats survival gide."" His family is cursed so Stanley gets sent to Camp Green Lake. Zero runs away and they both travel to the moutain called,""God's Thumb."" Then they drink the water and then they get lucky."
5,Our Class Loved This Book,"Our class loved ""Holes"". We visited Camp Green Lake each day in class, and enjoyed it. We now reading Harry Potter, and debating which one is better. This is a great book for all kids! (And Adults)"
4,Holes book review,"Have you ever been in the wrong place at the wrong time? Well, for Stanley Yelnats he has been dealing with that problem is whole life. Which he blames on his great grandfather because he was cursed according to Stanley's family. Sanley finds himself in the wrong place at the wrong time when he is accused of stealing the shoes of the famous athlete, Clyde Livingston. He then has a choice to make, go to jail, or to Camp Greenlake. He chooses to go to Camp Greenlake because he has never been to a camp before. That is because his family is too poor. At Camp Greenlake he has to dig a hole five feet high and wide. While he is there he meets many new people and finds a new friend. As Stanley keeps having more bad luck you come to learn his family's past. I strongly recommend this children's book to all children, if you want to laugh and have a little bit of mystery in your book. Louis Sachar, the author does an amazing job in this book as he keeps you from wanting to put this book down."
5,THE REASON HOLES INFLUENCED MY LIFE IS BECAUSE...,"The reason I think this book influenced my life is because stanley never gave up. Never giving up is called intellectual perserverance. Holes has a lot of intellectual perserverance. When they accuse stanley of stealing cleats from the orphanage he never gave up the fact that he was innocent. Stanley never gave up digging holes in the heat, and he never gave up when climbing the mountain. The reason why I think this book influenced my life is because if i never of read this book I would of gave up on a lot of things, for example my math homework and chores. So I didn't give up and in the end I finished. I ended up getting an ""A"" on my homework and getting money for doing my chores."
4,Tight plot. Lots of sand.,"All events tie in together to form a delicious whole as the characters discover one page at a time the mysterious past and uncertain future of their lives. Treasure, lizards, and evil people to be conquered - this is what this novel is about. Also in a subtle way, Holes points out the evils of ignorance and racism. Great moral story, recommended for kids as well as adults."
5,A Great Book!,This was a great book. I was intrigued by this book. I just couldn't put the book down!! I would recommend this to other readers who love adventures.
1,Holes review,"If you want a good book, don't choose Holes by Louis Sacher. This book stinks. Cops have to know about what they do there. It's in the middle of a desert, people are going to wonder what they're doing there since there's no lake or grass. Also, how are the kids' moms going to send mail to them, and how do they send out mail without a mailman coming to get the mail? Fate plays too much of a big role in this book."
1,"holes,not a good book to read","I personally didn't like this book only beacause when Stanley was in the hole with the lizards, not one of them bit him. They say Sam's onion juice was the cure. That's not true. This book was not realistic. This would be good for children because the chapters were so short. The story didn't make sense until the end. Also, when they are left in the desert and up on the mountain for that long just eating old sploosh and drinking the juice, there is no way they could have survived. In my opinion this is not the book for me."
1,Rview,"Summary:In the book holes there are two different stories which are narrated by turns.One story that playes in the present is about a boy called Stanley Yelnats.By a mischance in that he is innocentStanly is about the historical conditions of Camp Green Lake over 100 years ago.ordered to go to Camp Greenlake,digging holesfor building character. But that is not the real reason!!!!!!!!!!!!!!The reason is told in the secons story. You also learn somethingAuthor: Louis SacharTitle: Holes"
4,Unforgetable book - good for book reports,"The book Holes by Louis Sachar is a book of mystery and adventure. This book takes place in modern day Texas where there is a camp called Camp green lake for troubled boys like Stanley Yelnats and Hector Zeroni, nicknamed Zero. Camp green Lake is a camp in the middle of a desert that used to be a giant lake, but the lake dried up, and the boys spend every day digging holes 5 feet deep, and 5 feet wide. One day Zero decides that he has had enough, and he runs away into the desert and it is up to Stanley to find zero and help him survive. The theme of Holes is karma and justice. Karma, or ""what goes around comes around"" is an important theme since every plot and subplot comes full circle. Justice is also an important theme, since each character gets what they deserve. I would recommend Holes to kids between the ages ten and thirteen since it is a great book. I think it is too long for younger children."
5,"Holes, by Louis Sachar","This is a really outstanding book which I received as a gift when I ordered another book. It is a thoroughly entertaining read, not only for children but for adults as well. I am now about to order a copy for my brother (aged 42) and sister. What I do NOT recomend is to read all the reviews which follow this one, as several completely give the plot away and will spoil the story for you. It is dirt cheap, so I recommend: LOOK NO FURTHER AND ORDER YOUR COPY NOW!Regards,Tristram"
5,FANTASTIC! We never saw the ending coming!,"We can't believe we didn't catch on before the end! The graphic ""lizard"" details were great...we were all squirming!"
5,a newberry indead,"this book is a well writen, well published example that there is still good literasy in the world, for the past newberry books i have been disipointed in."
4,Good Review,I would highly recommend this book. It is \very interesting. There is drama in this book. It is about a kid that is sent to boot camp and has to find something. The book is featuring Stanley Yeltz. The book is recommended for all ages 10 and up.
5,Welcome to Camp Green Lake,"Welcome to Camp Green Lake, where bad boys go. This is a really good book. In this book, you'll meet Stanley Yelants. He is the main character in the story. You will meet many characters such as Zero, Madame Zeroni, Armpit and the Warden. While you are there, you will be digging lots of holes. Have lots of fun.P.S. Watch out for theYellow Spotted Lizards."
5,Holes,"In my opinion I think Holes was an excellant book. I don't like to read most books because I don't enjoy them but Holes was one of those books I couldn't put down. I just couldn't wait to find out what was going to happen next. I recommend this book to anyone of any age. Holes was a great book, I suggest you should start reading this book! It will make your day."
3,"Holes, A Story Within A Story",I liked Holes.The characters are really funny and sometimes really mean. The story is about a boy named Stanley Yelnats who is cursed by his no-good-dirty-rotten-pig-stealing-great-great-grandfather and gets in alot of trouble. He was in the wrong place at the wrong time.I didn't like Holes. There are alot of mysteries in the book. The author (Louis Sachar) doesn't explain any of them. The book gets very dull sometimes.The story is about a camp called Camp Green Lake where you are forced to dig holes that are exactly 5 feet wide and 5 feet deep. (...) That is about as much as I could tell you.
5,My Style,"Holes is a story,within a story,within a story,within a story.Sachar's style makes you think of many ideas and wonders.He wrote all different stories which had holes for you to fill and find out for yourself.His style made me stay focused in the book because you are dealing with all these thoughts and ideas that you would never know what would happen next.But in the book there are good points and there are bad points.The good points are when the book gets really exciting and your just have to know what happens next.The bad points are like at the end when he keeps you hanging and you want to know what happend to everybody else which kind of surprised me.He just wants you to fill in holes yourself.Overall, Sachar's style is my style because it's not those kind of books that stick to the same boring subject, it is the kind of wonders that all come together in the end when you finished filling your hole."
5,Hooked by page five,"By the time I had reached page 5, I was hooked. I have only about 20 pages left which I will finish tonight. Although it's an easy read in terms of language and vocabulary, it's a wonderfully told story. In terms of structure, it's similar to Oryx and Crake (without the profanity and science fiction) and Other Worlds (without the mysticism). If you haven't read Holes -- READ IT!!!"
1,holes,"In my opinion, I hate the book Holes because there isn't enough action in the book. All it talks about is the holes that Stanley and his friends have to dig because they got in trouble in school. When people asked me what book should they read I wouldn't tell them to read the book Holes. Some of the books I read I enjoy but not Holes."
4,great,"I purchased 9 copies of the book (Holes) to read with a group of special education students that I teach. All books were in good shape, the shape that was advertised, and delivery was all within a few days. Since I ordered 9 books they came from different places. This was the second time I have done this and it worked out great both times."
3,Holes review,Holes is a pretty good book. I like a lot. I think it is more for boys. It is about a boy named Stanley. He was blamed for stealing a pair of valueble shoes. He was sent t6 camp Green Lake. There he had to dig one hole a day. It had to be five feet deep and five feet in diameter. He is cursed by his great great dirty rotten pig stealing granfather. He finds his family treasure and becomes rich! At camp Green Lake he meets a lot 6f new friends. One of the0 5s named zero. He is called that because he has nothing going on in his head. But Stanley help him learn how to read in extange zero helps Stanley dig his hole.
5,Holes ~ Not Just For Kids,"If you're thinking about seeing the movie ""Holes"" do yourself a favor and read the book first. The book Holes is pretty much standard reading in middle school. If you know someone who has been in the 6th grade recently, then he/she has probably read Holes. A friend of mine who is a 7th grade English teacher, gave me a copy of the book. He insisted that I read it before I go see the movie. I'm glad I did. The story was amusing, exciting, funny and absurd in the style of Kurt Vonnegut. I liked this book a lot. I'd read it again. Two thumbs up! I can't wait to see the movie."
5,Buy This Book,"Holes is a great book. The book I would buy for 100,000 dolars. Trust me its worth the 6.99. When I first got the book Holes I started from the first page and then I just keep on reading."
5,Diggin Up Some Holes,The book I'm reviewing is Holes. Holes is written by Louis Sachar. I give it a four or five stars because it is a great book! This book is about Stanley Yelnats families' curse. A problem that occurs is Stanley has to go to Camp Green Lake. Along the way he meets new friends. I recommend this book to people because it is awesome and great!
5,the great american novel.....,"This book is really awesome. I recomend it to kids as well as adults. Stanley has to work in the sun beating down on him at 105 degrees. He must dig a hole each day which is very deep.You won't get bored thats for sure. Then there is Mr. Sir (I know that is an odd name,but who cares) who is one of there counselers and is very strange in many ways. You will see what I mean. So! What are you waiting for? If there was 20 stars, it would be that."
5,Holes the Adventure Begins,"I rate Holes 5 out of 5 stars.It's a really great book. The main character, Stanley Yelnats, is a boy who always has unfortune luck. Which is made by a curse caused by his no-good-dirty-pig-steeling-great-great grandfather. In order to break the curse Someone in Stanley's family has to carry"
3,Holes,"This book starts off with Stanley Yelnats sitting by himself on a bus for commiting a crime he didnt do. He ends up at camp green lake where he meets, the she is a very mean lady who makes all the kids dig holes cause there is some sort of treasure that is there. Stanley is not as tough as the other boys so its difficult to fit in till he meets Zero who is the only kid who will befriend Stanley. Zero and Stanleyend up figguring out what the Warden is up to and they run away off on an adventure and try to find an object called God's thumb. This book is for a teen audience and I would reccomend this book for people who love to read about friend ship and adventure. Jigsaw"
5,"Welcome to Holes by, Whyshould Icare??","Holes is a great book for kids who love adventure,suspense and fun. Holes, which is written by Louis Sachar, has a lot of twists and turns in the story. I thought that it was very interesting how Sachar kept using the number 3 in the story...our class counted the number of times 3 was in the book(we counted about 60-80 times). When you read this story, see how many times you can find the number 3!!! Also Sachar had many connections between characters I thought would never be. Also try to see these connections. I hope you enjoy going on this adventure with Stanley, Zero and all of his friends while reading this book. ENJOY!!"
3,Extra! Extra! Read this HOLES review!,"HOLES is a big story, including three stories that equal a lot of characters, a lot of settings, and a lot of memories--good and bad! Sachar made the story so long but at the end, he stops us short!There was a lot of good expressions, like ""I can fix that"" or ""If only, if only..."" or even ""her head is as empty as a flower pot."" I think that the book was not the best, but not the worst! I was always on the edge of my seat, but in the end, I realized that I was on the edge of my seat for no reason!"
4,The green child,This was a gift to my daughter who is pregnant. She has not read it yet so I cannot comment on it's content at this time
5,Pratchett,"What can I say, it is Terry Pratchett. As with all things written or produced by this strange man: It is outstanding."
5,I love these!,"I'm a big guy and wear the 3x size. I absolutely love these shirts. Good fitting, easy to wash, well made and good looking. What more can you say. I'll be buying more in different colors."
5,Great Shirts,"These shirts fit extraordinarily well! They are a little ""extra"" tall in the tall size which is greatly appreciated, as I am 6'5, and even tall sizes are often a little shorter than I would like. I also ordered XXXL for working out and love them because they are generously sized but do not have an oversized neck, which I also often find to be a problem! An excellent value!"
2,Dissapointing :-<,"Not as good as the other albums, Wild V.5 is not one of there best CD's. There where about 5 good songs on the album that I liked. Although everyone has different tasts, this one didn't taste to good."
5,One of the Best War Books Written,This is on of the best books ever written about war. I'm a NCO in the Army and I believe that this book should be a preferred read on any soldiers list. I've served in Iraq on the front lines and the emotions that Audie Murphy writes about in this book are still identical in today's war.
3,A Fun Read!,"This was a fun book. All of the characters are people you would never think would be in the role of hero/heroine. They are different and that's what makes these stories so fun! Each story is a stand alone, but you meet all of the characters in the first one.Ms. Davidson is a true talent with a great scense of humor. The chemistry between the couples is great and the storylines for each of the three tales are unusual but fun. This is a great way to spend the weekend!"
4,Great!,I am so suprised at how good this CD is! I am going to buy one now!Brandy blew me away!You go girl!
3,It was a little boring.,"Brandy's alum was all right, but she's too damn sweet. I wish that she would switch beats and make some sassy songs. All in all, the CD isn't horrible, and she does have talent. However I wish that I hadn't spent money on that album."
5,"Brandy is a definate ""diva of the year.""","I love her cd and the song ""have u ever"" is so touching. She brings out the best in r&b and she has a little rap with MA$E while she is at it. She and Monica make an awesome dueo and the boy is mine was a complete success. My friend and I would pretend we were Brandy and Monica and sing to it. It is a definate hit. Everyone needs to be jammin' with this cd."
1,She needs to learn how to sing.,"I have to say that Brandy does have a beautiful voice - that's a gift that God gave her. Unfortunately her singing skills are..almost a zero. Please, please, please do NOT compare her with Mariah Carey or Whitney Houston - that's very insulting to those 2 very very talented and skilled singers (Mariah also writes awesome songs which I suppose Brandy can only dream of doing.). So Brandy is lucky. She got some people to write good songs for her. And obviously those people already took her singing skills into consideration - all the songs in the CD are very easy to sing. But even then Brandy still had quite difficulty with the slightly difficult notes. I can't begin to imagine how it'd sound like without the music. That's why in many songs you can barely hear what she's singing. I like the last song ""everything I do.."". But I think Bryan Adams performed it much better than she did. The reason I like it is only because it's a good song."
1,I hated it Boooooooooooooooooooooo,I LIKED BRANDY BEFORE SHE HAD THIS ALBUM KNOW I cAN'T STAND HER. THIS ALBUM MADE ME FEEL SICK IT PUT ME TO SLEEP IT EVEN HAD ME SNORING. WHEN I HEARD THE ALBUM I WANTED TO TAKE IT BACK TO STORE. I EVEN GAVE TO MY COSIN BECAUSE SHE LOVES BRANDY AND SHE PAID ME FOR IT SO I GOT MY MONEYS WORTH.I TOOK THAT MONEY AND BOUGHT MONICA CD AND LOVED IT.
5,I LOVE BRANDY!!!!!!,"BRANDY,is awesome!!!!!! she is so cool! I HOPE THAT SOMEDAY I WILL MEET HER! i LOVE that song she sings ""have you ever?"" every time i here that song,i cry!!:("
3,...,"Brandy is blessed to have people who can create catchy music for her because her singing voice is seriously lacking. She's young though and smart enough to continue to hone her craft. Otherwise, by true adulthood, Monica, who has a stronger and somehow sweeter voice, will step up to the plate and put forth some real music instead of pop/rnb"
4,Great Voice,"I love this album it has everything anybody would want. I do not understand English real well but I love her voice. My favorite songs are Angel in Gisguise and Top of the World. I strongly recomend this CD because it has romantic song, pop song, and in other word it is good it is nice."
2,"Don't expect too much, that way you won't be disappointed.","Brandy Norwood has definitely matured. Sadly, her second album does not reflect this. The better songs are at the beginning of the CD. Sure, there are some catchy dance mixes and heart-warming ballads. But the overall mood of the CD induces the after-breakup feel. Her vocal talent has been compared to the soulful Monica Arnold. THERE IS NO COMPARISON. Monica's sultry voice is much more pleasant than the anemic cries of the Cover Girl/star of MOESHA. Die-hard fans are not being discouraged from investing in this CD, however you wouldn't feel as disappointed if you would just borrow your neighbor's."
5,THIS CD IS AWESOME!,"Brandy is one of today's most talented artists in the R&B industry; singing, writing and producing. (Not to mention Moesha!) But this album is HOT! I love every song on it, which is totally cool! And to all who doubt Brandy, NEVER SAY NEVER!!!"
5,this is a good review,"you are very fine, and this is better than your last album. I like"" the boy is mine"","" never say never"" , and""on top of the world""."
3,Dark and Edgy,"I've listened to Brany's new CD and was pleased. I liked the ballads best cause they sound like she was drawing on personal experiece(real dark and edgy) The one thing that bother's me is why does everyone keep saying that The Boy Is Mine is by Brandy? I'm confused cause Monica has a CD by the same name. Iim just curious. But overall, I think Brandy's album will be the next think I buy."
5,WOW..this album takes me back!!!,"In my opinion it is NOT one bad song on this cd,i love em all.This has to be her best album!It feels good to just put this cd in and let it play!"
2,Nothing to write home about,"I believe that we would be able to enjoy Brandy's music better if we were able to hear what she's saying. Her voice is still pretty, but I couldn't understand the lyrics, so I got frustrated because when I spend money to hear a CD, I expect to understand what you're talking about."
5,This artists got talent and is going places!,"I loved listening to this cd and I never got tired of it and now everyone is singing her songs and they are constantly playing on the radio and Im still not tired of hearing those tunes. I can't wait to see how Brandy's career takes off and what she comes out with next. I think this is an artist to keep your eye on. She has skills and is going places, I know it, she knows it and so should you."
2,Why put in 50 pages what you can use 350 for?,"For non-programmers who won't need to DO any VB programming. Much of content is repetitive and did I say repetitive? Examples are useless and do absolutely nothing you'd ever want to actually do. No CD with book, but you don't need one since code is as advertized, for idiots. On some of the more complex issues (the few he covers) I found treatment confusing and generated many more questions than it answered. I did enjoy the author's ""flippant"" tone. This may be the place you want to start if you are a computerphobic who's determined to start programming. Its almost painless and just as useful."
5,My Fave SM Movie of all time!,"I am a HUGE fan of all Animes, from Pokemon to Cardcaptors to Sailor Moon, but SM remains on top of all others! The movie is about Rini, the cuteness and pinkness (see her hair to see what I mean) of the series. The evil Badiyano (what kind of name is THAT?!) has a dream to put all the children of Earth in their own ""Dream Boxes"", where they will all be in a peaceful dream for eternity. Every child gives his/her ""Dream Energy"" to the ""Black Dream Hole"" while they sleep. Soon, the Dream Hole will have enough power to suck up Earth and put ALL humans into Dream Boxes! When she discovers that Rini, while she is Sailor Minimoon, has more Dream Energy than that of your normal child, Badiyano uses ALL of Minimoon's energy for the Dream Hole. Will The other 8 Sailor Scouts, with the help of Peruru, save Rini? You have to watch to find out!"
2,"Don't fall into the ""Black Dream Hole""","I am very sorry for my poor rating that I give this movie, but in my opinion, it is the worst of all three Sailor Moon movies. Most importantly of all, Black Dream Hole doesn't even come close to comparing with Sailor Moon R-Promise of the Rose.First of all, the beginning is a little stale, and the plotline wasn't thought out very well.I also didn't like Rini's voice in the dub, (which was different from the series), and it was irritating me throughout the entire movie.Another thing I wasn't fond of was the relationship between Rini and the fairy-boy that she met, Peruru. I'm a Helios-Rini fan myself and it was frustrating that Rini already discovered a new infatuation...There are many, many other things that I found wrong with this movie, but I'll make a long list short and say that you should definitely not see this movie, no matter how big of a Sailor Moon fan you are..."
2,it was pretty bad,"they say its aimed at kids, theres bad words in it! the captions arre hard to read"
3,blah,"This movie was good, but not as good as the subbed version was. They cut out the silliest parts. One was a scene where Serena was spanking Rini to knock her out of a trance. Another was where the Sailor Senshi had their powers removed, so they looked sort of naked, yet there were no actual parts drawn...you Sailor Moon fans know what I'm talking about, I'm sure. They changed a good lot of the words around. It's plain ridiculous. If you're a hardcore Sailor Moon fan, I recommend the subbed version."
4,Great Graphics but poor storyline,"Is this video worth buying? Not really...unless you want it solely for the awesome music and graphics. But even then, the villian isn't the greatest, and it's much more violent than the other 2 movies (Think Tuxedo Kamen getting smacked into a wall a few times) and the whole Mini Moon always with SM is kinda annoying... Also, Setsuna(Pluto) sounds really high-pitched and annoying, but everyone else seems fine :) I LOVED the graphics and music, and that's what totally makes this movie worth it! Also, I got the DVD and they didn't change too much when they dubbed it into English from Japanese."
5,Sailor Moon Super S The Movie - Black Dream Hole VHS,I love this movie! It is very interesting but kind of messed up. For example during a part when they were riding in Pararu's gandala before Pararu could finsh speaking they cut it and then Sailor Venus started talking.There are some questions you'll have and not find an answer to them. My advice is to get the uncut subtitles.The good things about it is the music and at least they didn't change it that much ; I think.Anyway my favorite part is when Sailor Mini Moon Kisses Pararu at the end:).
4,Better than I expected!,"After reading all the reviews, I can say I wasn't looking forward to viewing this movie. The third of the movies, it may not be as tear jerking or have such a deep plot or good fighting scenes. but one thing this one does have is humor. A lot of it. And Sailor Moon humor is something I live for. It does have one crude little joke from Neptune to Uranus, which is utterly hilarious if you know that whole story. If you are looking for the same thing you got in the other movies, a better plot or fighting sequence, this may not be for you. but if you like a bit of everything and a surplus of funny jokes, this is the way. It includes all the senshi, even Diana (Luna and Artemis's daughter from the future), except Hotaru (Sailor Saturn) and Chibichibi. I really liked it."
3,Great for the Children,"It was ok. I thought it would have been alot better thought. They rushed it things. They could have add a lot more in. Well I thought the attacks were pretty cool. They enemys were very sucky. But like I said, Great for kids:)"
3,Before you buy this. . .,I would just like to note that I love Sailor Moon Super S and I do recomend it just NOT this version. If you want to see the good version that you'll enjoy much more buy the subtitled Sailor Moon SuperS and not the dub. . . that is all. . .
3,Not the best,"This is the first Sailor Moon movie I have purchased and watched. At first it was pretty good, but then i thought about it, and it wasn't so awesome. It's pretty good, and since it's so cheap, I'd reccomend it if you're really bored."
4,Good songs from an underrated band,"They never made much of an impact in the US, but China Crisis put out several wonderful records throughout the 80's. This collection documents their development from synth-pop to the kind of layered, mature music that isn't heard much anymore. Smooth, intelligent, and very appealing."
1,Hagiography for pyramid scheme,"For people who can't or won't think critically. Yet more worthless crap from the dangerous and vicious Scientology cult.Hagiographic to the extreme - that fat ginger contain is just flawless, and if you dare disagree, you are ""suppressive"""
5,I'm delighted to have poetry published in this edition,"Blue Mountain Arts anthologies are beautiful, inspirational and capable of pulling people closer! That is the thing that makes them so special. I especially love this one - naturally, because my poetry appears within! I'm honored to have poetry published with Blue Mountain Arts and can't offer this volumn enough praise! The poets who contribute to the pages of Blue Mountain Arts anthologies are insightful, sensitive souls who I forever enjoy reading!"
5,A magnificent geology primer,"A very well-written book on geology and geologists.If you have ever wondered about that hill or this rock, or if you have ever wondered about the natural history of our planet, you should read this book."
5,A nonreader discovers joy,"My new husband does not read for pleasure. When I read excerpts from this book to him he was so fascinated that I ordered a copy for him.He has read steadily every day and finished book 1 . He announced that he is now more interested in Geology than in Engineering, which is his field... Thank you, John McPhee...."
4,"As always, McPhee makes geology interesting","Despite a few flaws in the book, I really enjoy McPhee's extended essays. This book is really several books compiled together and I agree with one reviewer that the first one is the weakest of the group.That being said, McPhee makes geology so accessible and interesting to the novice, that I whole-heartedly recommend his books. Geology is a fascinating subject that doesn't get enough accessible writing for those interested in science who don't possess a college degree in a scientific discipline. McFee hasn't completely plugged the gap, but has slowed the flow. I hope other authors step forward and give us what we want. Good reading geologic history of our planet."
5,Love it!,"This was our original shower head before it blew a gasket, we tried to repair it but the repairs never held. We replaced it with another Delta head (less expensive and not adjustable spray)...and we hated that one! After a month we decided to go back to this head and I'll never switch again!"
5,A fine and classic recording,"I first heard of the Strawbs some 12 years ago, but was never able to find their recordings until the release of the ""Halcyon Days"" anthology; listening to it, I found my appetite for this band's music whetted with a vengeance. As soon as I knew that A&M had reissued their LPs from 1970-75 on CD, I knew that this would have to be one of those that I purchased. And I'm happy to say I did not regret the decision to do so; ""Witchwood"" is a classic from start to finish. The title cut is a haunting cautionary tale that features Rick Wakeman on clarinet (!), ""The Hangman and the Papist"" an angry diatribe against religious persecution that never fails to bring tears to my eyes, and ""Thirty Days"" a fine, breezy little piece featuring sitar that has stayed with me since hearing the CD. Highly recommended."
4,Fun & Entertaining!,"I've been a fan of Jane Heller's book for years.If you haven't read her books you are missing out. Some Nerve is clever, humorous and entertaining. I always look forward to the next book by the very talented Jane Heller."
5,Love It,If the Pat man is in it it's an instant hit with me. If I had three wishes one of them would be that Patrick was still with us.
3,Not very complete,"I was very disappointed that this video is only 30 minutes long if that. Although it gave some very basic guidelines, it certainly didn't address much more than taking pictures under perfect conditions like a bright but clouded (no shadows) day. Gave a few tips but not many. Not worth the money. Only good thing about paying this much money for so little is the profits go to a non-profit organization."
1,Mildly Informative,"Maybe I was expecting too much from this video, however, I found it to be basic in the extreme. I'm a novice and don't really understand the more subtle points of lighting and composition and this video did almost nothing to change that."
2,What a loser!,"How or even why this book got into the terrific Penguin Lives series is a mystery to me. It has no raison d'etre. It makes a lot of excuses for offering such minimal insight into Melville, especially his later years. It is structured on a book-by-book review of his work (not his life) and concedes that only a few of his works would be worth reading today. Further, it is dominated by the affected and distracting voice of the author."
3,Great design. Doesn't ship well.,"I shopped and shopped for a light colored armoire with simple lines and I fell in love with this design. I tried to have two delivered and in both cases it simply wasn't packed well enough to withstand shipping and so the doors were sprung and damaged. Still, I was not at all disappointed with the design and the wood veneer. But, I gave up on trying to have it shipped the third time."
3,Is the Sky Falling?,"I'm a catastrophe freak and normally relish these kinds of books, but there's an element of ""the sky is falling"" to this tome. Admittedly, the globalization of politics and economics has opened the door to massive illicit activity, an unintended consequence of technology and the fall of the Russian empire, Reagan's gift to all of us. But, in reality, what do we expect poor people around the world to do? They can't afford any of our Western niceties, i.e., luxury goods, so they copy and sell to any buyer very authentically looking fakes. I operate a business in California that trades on a copyrighted name, well-known in our sports-niche market. The trick to our survival? Remain under the radar with a line of products not quite extensive enough to interest the illicit traders. We're not Nike, and maybe it's just as well we're not. Get big, get copied."
5,Great film for the classroom.,I use some episodes from this film in my Spanish Literature class and it is always a favorite. it is multiregion so it plays in regular DVDs.
3,It does what it is supposed to do,"When I got my Tom Tom One, there was a quick start guide that was to say the least inadequite. One of the things they left out was the fact that you can charge your Tom Tom using the USB cable connected to your computer. Insted they have a stern warning in their quick start guide suggesting you spend 30 bucks more to buy the Charger. The Charger works fine, but I don't think much of Tom Tom's business ethics in not including detailed information about their product when the consumer purchases it so you don't end up spending money on things you really don't need. For that reason, I wouldn't give Tom Tom any stars."
1,Porduct never received,"First order was the wrong equipment, the second order, the seller reported to be out of stock. I believe that I will purchase future items at stores, so that I can see the product and know what I am getting. This system leaves to much room for fraud, misrepresentation, and dishonisty."
4,RIP Fat Pat,"This is a must have, if you want and older cd, it can still hang with the new ones out there. It's a shame Pat got took from us. RIP to you and all the other fallen soldiers that got lost in the game."
1,Fat Pat cd,"I have purchased items from amazon before, but this is the first time I am not happy with the order. I got a Fat Pat cd with you all and it is miss a song (If you only knew) which happens to be one of my favorite songs on the cd. I also thought it was an original cd but it is not. I didn't send it back because it is a hassel but I am not pleased with it at all !"
5,Daily Meditations for the heart and mind,"Hope you enjoy reading these as much as I enjoyed writing them.Sample:""You search the scriptures because you think that in them you have eternal life;...""--John 5:39 (NRSV - used by permission)Sitting at the desk of my daysPages pile upPaper and inkYellowed and curlingDry dustySearching textsWhile the Word knocks on the door of my roomA friend with a cup of tea."
4,Plays any dvd and some games as well.,"I just got my Game Wave and the first thing I did was check the dvd compatibility. It plays PAL and NTSC discs from any region. Does only have the standard L/R audio out, but for well under $100 it's a great buy! Oh yeah, did I mention it plays games as well?"
2,SHORT LIFE SPAN,"This product broke the first year we got it, The warranty is for something ridiculous like 30 or 90 days, should have researched that before I bought it. ALWAYS a red flag when the manufacturer doesn't guarantee their product for at least a year. Then our friend gave us theirs, they bought a wi, and THAT one also broke within a month! And no, we do not beat on our electronics.... We invested over $250 in this with the extra remotes and many of the games. If we had known it had such a short life span, we'd never have bought it. LET THE BUYER BEWARE, it's a piece of junk. To be fair, we DID enjoy playing it while it worked!!!Now I'm stuck with all these games and hate to throw them out, but it's just not popular enough to find anybody who wants them... :("
3,Good run of the mill show,"This show was interesting but I had hoped there would be more information. Most of the content was pretty well known already. Unless you want the series, I wouldn't download this. The information could be gleaned easily from a free web search."
3,There are better CD's to buy,"The first song is TOPOLINO (Mickey Mouse) and I think there is also a poorly sung Happy Days in English with a heavy Italian accent. It's not horrible, but I am holding out there are better CD's with true Italian children's songs."
4,A Comment.,"Although I have never even touched or heard of this book before, I gladly accept the fact that this book is supposably great. To the person who gave it a bad review, YOU ARE SUCH A JERK! DON'T YOU GET THAT ""it could have been better""SHOULD NOT BELONGED IN THE 1 STAR CATEGORY? FORGET YOU! ... that is all I have to say."
4,A fine transfer from the original master tapes.,Regent Records seem to have taken their version from a Mono.LP ?. This Dutton reissue is nicely refurbished and in stereo too.
4,All Included,"I have not had a chance to use any of the products yet, but it has everything included for any type of distressing project possiblility."
1,Unstable - returned,"I ordered two crate bowls to compare: The Ethical and the ProSelect bolt-on. I beg to differ with all the positive reviews for the Ethical. I attached it to the crate, and it was totally unstable. Not only could the bowl be dislodged, but the entire holder moved around. On the other hand, the ProSelect has remained firmly in place since being attached. I do not recommend the Ethical Stainless Steel 20-oz. Coop Cup."
5,Light but sturdy crate wall bowl,"Easy to clean, easy to hang on a crate with no permanent fixtures that can injure your critter. The bowl is sturdy to stand up to being knocked around by a 70# pit bull, and holds enough food to feed one."
1,"Outdated, frustrating and nearly useless is not fun","A guidebook that is copyrighted 1992 is not worth purchasing in 2006 unless you are doing a research paper on places people formerly took their children and what the prices used to be. Some of the places no longer exist, those that do may have new names or telephone numbers that are changed,disconnected or now have different area codes. One just does not know which pages are valid or partially valid. For example, there is a listing for the Bolingbrook Aquatic Center Wave Pool, which has not been in existance for years. However, Bolingbrook Park District does have a state of the art water park and pool facility,which hosts birthday parties, and has a competetive swim team. Anyone who purchases this book should be aware that using it for ""enhanced family fun"" will probably end up with frustrated children and an ""enhanced family ulcer""."
4,Wow!!,I have a workout partner at work and I got this to change up our routine. What a change it is!! I would recommend watching each video at least once and practicing the moves before you jump into the workout.
5,Powerful stuff!!!,"Man, this album is astounding in all aspects: her sultry, smooth voice, the live and synthetic instruments perfectly blended together in harmony, lyrics which exude depth and solidity, and an overall superb combination of disco, R&B/soul, and house.Situation: Critical is a concept album about love and relationships, and coping with hard times. Ultra Naté shines brilliantly, in my opinion, better than her somewhat more cursory preceding albums. Even non-Ultra fans will love this, I've managed to convert some already!! Her sound is so different from others, she really is a paragon in the dance genre!Fave songs: ""Love You Can't Deny"" ""Any Ole Love"" ""Release the Pressure"" and ""Found a Cure (full intention mix)""You HAVE to have this one...even if it's not your favorite...Ultra deserves support for her hard work, dedication, and talent. BUY BUY BUY!!!"
4,Situation: sounding good,"This CD features some good house tracks, including her worldwide hit ""Free"". It also features the hit singles ""Found A Cure"" and ""New Kind Of Medicine"". The rest of the album sticks to the same formula. ""Release The Pressure"" is well written and upbeat, with the usual ""house"" feel, and ""Love You Can't Deny"" sounds similar to Free. Tracks like ""Every Now And Then"" and ""Any Ole Love"" are good to listen to, but nothing special - a bit of a change from her usual dance stuff. Sitaution:Critical isn't full of repetitive club tracks; all of the songs are well written and are generally good tunes."
3,So soft,"These sheets are extremely soft and comfortable. The white color is very crisp and clean and the pillow cases are warm against your face and don't feel cheap. They have gotten a bit worn fairly quickly, but I still think they are worth the buy."
3,Rougher than what I expected,"These sheets were offered as part of a Friday Sale, and seemed to be a great value. Having had jersey sheets in the past, I expected that this would mellow into old tee-shirty softness after a few months. Instead, its intitially shiny, smooth finish has become as rough as a fine-grit sandpaper, and the sheets have been rent with tiny holes. The laundering instructions were followed, so I was a little surprised by these developments; the sheets are on average washed once every four weeks (no, they are not my only set) which does not constitute excessive washing and drying. While I'm disappointed, I'll continue to use the sheets unless the texture becomes grittier."
2,comfy but poor durability,"After one wash cycle, these sheets split at the seams. Otherwise soft and comfortable."
2,I can't believe they raised the price of these! Not worth it,I bought these back a few months ago for 29.99 including the blanket. The first pair I recieved - I discovered a hole as I was putting on the bed for the first time. Amazon was extremely helpful in replacing! These fit my pillowtop bed well - but am extremely dissappointed in the amount of piling in them already. Can't believe they raised the price!
1,TERRIBLE.....DO NOT WASTE YOUR MONEY,"These sheets are not soft. I gave these as a present, and when they peeled off the label the glue still stayed on the sheets and did not come off. I was very embarrased. They tried everything. Freezing the glue, using adhesive remover, pure soap, nothing worked. NOTHING"
1,Disappointing,"I was really disappointed with these jersey sheets. After one washing, they ""pilled"" really bad. I still use some jersey sheets I've had for years and they have never ""pilled"". The price was great but not the product."
3,"Soft and Comfortable, Wore Out Quickly","I loved the look and feel of these sheets but they wore out and got bleach stains from normal Tide detergent very quickly. If I purchased again I would get white, not blue, to avoid the bleaching. Unfortunately, I had to throw them out pretty quickly after buying them."
2,A Field Guide to trees and shrubs: NE and North-central US (Peterson Filed Guides),This book would be a lot better if it had more pictures. It's hard to compare a real specimen to a written paragraph.
3,too few visual aids,I bought this book to teach myself how to recognize some of the main trees that I see around me.I have not found it very useful. The lack of visual aids makes it difficult for someone who is just learning to figure his way around. An image is worth a thousand words... and this book appeals much more to words than to images.
5,Very pleases,"I just finished installing these seat covers in my son's '98 Toyota Tacoma. Exceptional fit, very hight quality material, and easy installation. They look like factory-installed seat covers."
1,MISLEADING - This is an ASYLUM knock off,"There is NO region A Blu-Ray release of Darren Bousman's ""11-11-11"". I don't know WHY the studio didn't release a region A Blu-Ray, but they DIDN'T.THIS disc is an ASYLUM KNOCK OFF.Asylum has been getting VERY bold in the titling of their knock off films recently. They got sued for ""American Battleship"" and the lawsuit was dropped after they renamed it to ""American Warships.""For this film, Asylum used slashes (/) instead of dashes (-). If there isn't currently a lawsuit over this, there should be."
3,Nice Effort to Scare Us in A Timely Fashion !,"This film is topical, fastly paced and very intense.The director/co-writer was first noticed by Asylum for his acting in '3Musketeers'.Unknown actors usually add to the realism of a film,Yes,It's true here too.There are numbers of creep-out moments that set us up for a fall-ALWAYS look for your cat ,As soon as it comes up missing.Beware of nannies (Aww,Check the news tonite and every night from now on).Birthdays can be a big deal to a whole town.Never,Ever move into a neighborhood,Sight unseen..."
4,The shocker on shock street,I didnt think the book was bad. I liked it because I love scary stories. I didnt really understand the ending. But I liked how they found out they were robots. I thought it was cool that it was in the shocker street theme park.You should read this book.
2,"Pretty Good Book, But Terrible Ending","It was a pretty good story about two freind(Marty and Erin)that loved horror movies and went to a horror theme park. The firsthalf of the book was good, but..... The ending was very dissapointing. It ruined the whole book. I am a big fan of R.L. Stine and this book was one of his worst, Had to be the worst ending to a book ever."
3,okay boring book,this book is okay but it has a bad plot line and the kids are stupid in this book plus by the middle of the book this books gets really boring its stupid i mean the shock street movie charaters come to life how lame though i give this book 3 stars bassicly for laughs effort and thats it really
5,the history of a land,"The history (better say, the ""non"" history) of a land (Lucania one of the poorest of the poor south of Italy) its values, in a frame of a perpetual immobility in respect of the progress of the ""civilized"" world.Carlo Levi looks at it without expressing any moral judgement: he tries only to understand the ""Veltanschauung"" (what is ""behind"" and ""in"" the things) of the culture of a forgotten land and its people; so giving an impressive, positivist style, picture of an unknown civilization, too often absent-mindedly judged by people who did'nt care to understand the full and deep humanity of a land ""without sin and without redemption""(Preface"
3,"A nice book, but not worth reading.","I started reading this book thinking I was going to find a nice simple section on what kids should be taught and are taught these days. Instead I am bombarded by a number of sections that have nothing to do with the subject. On the other hand, it is a nice book if you want to spend your already wasted life reading some boring stuff."
3,"English translation only, does not include the origianal German.","Good, could be better. It should include the orinal German. But as far as I know there's nothing else."
1,Far From Comprehensive,"This book at first glance can appear pretty voluminous, it has a considerable heft to it, that being said it's pretty thin throughout. If you simply want translations of all the lyrics look no farther, if you're looking for detailed biographical and technical analysis however, you'll likely find this book disappointing. I was excited to look through this one when I first picked it up, and had a fair number of songs I was eager to learn more about, but I was somewhat let down when I found the book offered only a few sentences or a brief paragraph of criticism for some of my favorites. I suppose you can't blame the writer for his brevity considering the subject matter, but I wanted something more and overall didn't find this work particularly essential."
5,A super introduction to life beneath the ocean,"Sue Vyner and Tim Vyner--a mother and son team--have come up with a winning way to introduce little kids to the mysteries of life beneath the ocean waves. The text focuses on the constant maneuvering that has to be done by different fish in order to stay alive--both in terms of feeding themselves and in terms of avoiding becoming some other fish's meal! It's not too scary for even little kids, but does matter-of-factly present the realities of the food chain under the waves.The illustrations are a charming mix of painting and rubber stamping. They are exuberant and filled with movement, and there's a nice section at the end which examines in a more in-depth manner the different fish and other ocean dwellers you've just seen in the text."
1,I feel awful now,"Perhaps its my own fault for even reading this to begin with, but I have never felt worse after reading a book ... it's one thing to read about the facts and figures and 3rd-person experiences, but this book contains so much of the author's own experiences that I just felt kinda sick afterwards having been immersed in the mindset that wants this stuff. Maybe that's her point, but ugh, I feel terrible."
4,Victim of Deception,"This was a very interesting story. The opening paragraph would indicate it was a purely sexual book with no plot or story. However within two or three pages I found myself engrossed in a rather good story. After about ten pages, I was hooked. The plot, the character development, everything about it was really well done. I enjoyed the book and was disappointed when it ended. There was nothing wrong with the book, only I wanted to continue reading."
3,Melodic Rock Still Lives,"If you like melodic rock then will will like this CD. It's not as good as their first 2 CD's, but it is one of the their better CD's in recent years."
3,Not their best work...,"...but adequate. Some songs (Lady Ice and Mr. Hex) are barely listenable in 2002, but they were catchy enough in their day. At core, if you were to buy only one Heaven 17 album, this wouldn't be it, you'd be better served by a greatest hits collection. On the other hand, there are a couple of good tracks (i.e. Temptation) that are among the best Brit-Funk of the 80s."
3,Paperdoll [EP] [ECD] [edited],It's an ok cd. It has the same songs on it that Spit does but 5 are live and then there's a remix. Morgan really has worked on her voice which we hear on the Paperdoll remix. I don't like the edited part though.
3,Colorvision STV100 Spyder TV colormeter,"Set up as directed. Color, contrast, brightness setting recommended seemed to be ""too much"". I had to tune them back to make the picture correct to my eye. I'll try it again with the room totally dark to see if that will make any difference."
2,"tracks, please","Judging the material itself, I'd give this album five stars. I agree that it's Monty Python at the height of their powers. But the CD I have has exactly two tracks on it: Track 1 represents Side A of the original LP; Track 2 represents Side B. This is very annoying because, unless you have a good fast forward button on your CD player, you have to listen to an entire side just to hear one bit. How hard would it have been to include tracks?"
2,Leave the Midnite Movies to MGM & Samuel Z. Arkoff,"Received this in the mail yesterday and finished ""Mephisto"" earlier today. With this reportedly being the better of the two, I viewed it first. The sound effects are absolutely atrocious. They add nothing and take everything away. Sounds like my fooling around with household objects as a kind with a Fisher Price tape recorder. I treasure B-Movie flicks of this era as I lived only minutes away from the neighborhood Drive-In - it was something of a family tradition on weekends. Sadly, this is one for the fire. Check out What's The Matter With Helen instead."
1,Unchargeable,"I ordered this shaver as a replacement for my husband's 20 year old Remington that had worn out. Unfortunately, I returned it today because the shaver would not hold a charge. I am hoping for a refund."
1,Not as described,"This product was described as ""worldwide voltage"". On looking at the charging lead it said 120V AC. I e-mailed Amazon and my enquiry was forwarded to the supplier who told me to return the shaver and eventually I received a refund less postage."
5,This is my first Electric Razor...,"I have only had this unit for about 3 days, so far I like it. The shave is closer and smoother than I used to get using regular razor[Gillette Sensor Excel]. I am happy with it.I decided to write a review even though its too early because, before purchasing I looked for reviews and did not find many. Hopefully my review will help others in their decission making.I will write another review at the end of 30days.For now, I am a happy camper, pleased with Remington. Will continue to use it. I even used the pop-up trimmer on side bruns it works well."
5,I wish I had listened to these before I went to college!,"This data has completely changed how I study things, and it has helped me tremendously in teaching my own children.As a homeschooler, it is very important to me to have a good grasp on how people learn - these tapes explain just that.As I have learned more about the subject, my teaching of my own children has improved greatly. When the kids lose interest, refuse to study any more, get headaches or little tummy aches while learning, I know EXACTLY what causes the particular symptom, and exactly what to do to rectify it!My own IQ and abilities have increased as well."
3,SMG is cute,SMG is cute and sweet in this film . i loved the charater of brett. and the chemistry was ok between her and alec .... im giving the movie three stars cause sarah is in and is just cute...
2,Starring Buffy the Vampire Slayer,"I admit it. I watched Suburban Girl because of Sarah Michelle Gellar. What can I say? I love my Buffy. This movie is based on the short stories in The Girl's Guide to Hunting and Fishing by Melissa Bank. This further increased my interest, as I've seen the book, but never picked it up. (The movie has nothing to do with actual hunting or fishing, FYI.) Gellar is Brett Eisenberg, an editor, trying to work her way up at a NY publishing company, who meets Archie Knox (Alec Baldwin), a much older veteran of the publishing world. Romance ensues and real life tragedies interrupt, making both take watch of their lives. The funniest part about this movie was my boyfriend walking in and wondering who matched up Baldwin as Gellar's father. Uh, they are supposed to be a couple, yeah, so not believable. If you really love either of them, watch it, other than that save your time and watch Buffy the Vampire Slayer instead. We will all be much happier."
2,booooring,First I did not last the entire movieit was just too boring and slow movingI would have only given 1 star but I am surethere are worse movies out there so I was generous
2,Much Ado About Nothing,"Sarah plays a book editor who sets her sights on dating the CEO of a publishing company. And that's pretty much the whole story. The problem with this film is that it has no drama. Most of the first hour is just about the two people dating. The last half hour of the film was a little slow and meandering, before it attempts to put a happy ending on this rather dull and pointless story. I was disappointed and now I know why the film went straight to DVD."
4,The joy is in the footnotes,"As a religious reader of Simmons' stuff online, I was sketpical about buying this book. The extensive footnotes, however, which contain added jokes, exponential material and goofy asides made it more than worthwhile. The fun of this collection wasn't so much in reading the articles again, but in learning what the author thought about them as time passed."
1,Book not for Sports Guy fans,"If you regularly read the Sports Guy's column's on [...] then DO NOT buy this book!! If you read his columuns then you have already read 75% of the book for free and the rest is mostly his early work from his first website, which is not as good as his current stuff. To be truthful, I am very disappointed. I anxiously anticipate new columns from the Sports Guy every week and will continue to read those, but this book is geared more towards people who have not followed his writing. The only reason for a Sports Guy fan to buy this book would be to make sure he has the opportunity to write another so maybe next time he will put together some ORIGINAL thoughts that are worth spending your money to read. The Sports Guy is a great writer, but as strange as it is to say, fans should avoid it."
2,Perhaps you've read this before...,"Bill Simmons cleans out his hard drive and calls it a day and now a book. (Sorry, it had to be said). Anyone who has read the Boston Sports Guy could have just saved his articles and added their own commentary.Bill is a very talented and original writer but I would have rather read something that is new. I know he has a new daughter and we all need to make a buck, so I can't blame him.The columns are as a good as it gets about the Sox and sports, but you may have read this before.I wish the title was a better one. First, there are a few more important things that I would like to see happen in my life than a baseball team who could care less about me (except my wallet) win a World Series. Second, the title is a complete rip-off from 1994 when a fan had made that sign at Madison Square Garden after the NY Rangers won the Stanley Cup. Adding to the non-originality of the book."
2,handy but for buttons,"Very handy except the buttons are too hard to push. Definitely not the smooth, effortless clicking of the MS or other countless less expensive mice. Thus I am disappointed."
2,Bought 2 and both broke,"The first one lasted a couple of months, then the batteries started leaking and it became unusable. I bought another one, it did the same thing after a couple of months and since then it has been working most of the time. Now this one suddenly stopped working too!Note that I used the same duracell batteries that came with it originally.Also note that the second one I bought had a mail in rebate offer which I never received.When it works it's good, but I certainly don't recommend it."
1,Don't waste your money with this mouse,"We bought 5 of this model for our company executives, and all of them stop working well after 4 month.Pedro."
1,Worst mouse i have ever had,"This is the worst computer mouse i have ever had, i only have it for 1 month, It turns off every 5 minutes, i dont know what is wrong with it but the fact is that it is not working properly.I advice you not to buy it."
1,very uncomfortable!!!,"I have a siliver one. It's very hard to do clicking and bad for people to need to use mouse for long time. After I used it for a day, my back, right arm and right hand figures started hurting."
2,Disappointing,Sounded like it was just what I wanted...not so. More than half of the book is stuff I didn't need or would never need. A very small part of the book had minor plumbing and electrical repairs...I needed a book with simple repairs to things around and in the home for someone who is single and needs to do a lot of stuff themselves.
4,Amazon.com rocks,"Look, the iPod is great. But this one had a problem, and what was more significant to me was the extraordinary way Amazon took care of the problem. We received the replacement in slightly more than 24 hours after we called. Good stuff, this."
5,awesome ipod,This is my first ipod i like it sound quality is nice i use noise canceling headphones so it sounds great easy to use holds loads of music worth the price for sure i love my ipod i recomend this ipod to all
4,I Pod mania,"The I pod is great, I have the variety and convenience of hundreds of songs, and I don't have to worry about a hard drive failure since this is all memory based storage."
3,Easy to read,"The anatomist is the story of the man who discovered the clitoris. It takes place hundreds of years ago, in Italy."
3,"Great mountaineer, poor writer","Ed has had incredible experiences climbing tall mountains. Unfortunately his prose is unconvincing. A good editor could have vastly improved the book. Many of the passages that are meant to be humorous simply aren't. The numerous quotes from other people describing him as a great person, climber or as having had a big impact on them make Ed seem boastful.While the book tells the story of what happened including some very dramatic events, it somehow remains too factual to evoke strong emotions from me - I never felt like I was there. I also would have appreciated a little more technical discussion about critical decisions made during the climb rather than simply stating that he decided to turn back 300 feet from the summit."
4,A mixed bag,"This book is a mixed bag. When recounting his exploits on the 14 highest peaks, when describing the incredible mountaineers he has worked with, when philosophizing about the personal aspects of being a mountaineer (e.g. separation from loved ones), the books is riveting. However, by comparison, as he describes his life back in Washington and Oregon, his work as a carpenter, his recruitment of sponsors, the business aspect of trying to be a professional mountaineer, then the book significantly lags for me. I think his overall advice for climbing is useful advice for living: to paraphrase, the ascent is optional, the safe return is mandatory. In sum, start at the end of the journey, then shape the beginning to ensure you reach the end of the narrative."
3,No Shortcuts -,"Ed's feat is quite an amazing accomplishment, but the book tended to jump around a bit, breaking the continuity."
2,disappointing: poorly written and felt self promoting,"Let me start by saying how much I entirely respect Ed Viesturs' accomplishments and his mountaineering prowess.I put this book down thinking a little less of him as a person because:- he peppered his story with thinly veiled criticism of others' contributions to the sport- the bragging went on and on- I didn't need to read in the same book about his conquests at base camp as well as how great a dad he is. Incongruous.I wanted to be inspired but was just bored. There are many other books on or about mountaineers that are well written, factual, and therefore inspiring."
1,A Big Yawn,"The shovel goes about 1/2 inch deep, and few of his claims are documented. I already know that regular gas is as good as premium. So what?!This, I suppose, is downsized 21st Century investigative reporting. He is not fit to unfasten the shoes of people like Mike Wallace, Morely Safer, and, above all, Ed MurrowHarvest of Shame. And I'm a conservative!The only book that is as worthless as this tome is ""Freakanomics"". Tempest in a teapot, both of them.-jk"
4,What You See Is What You Get.,"When you read John Stossels book ""Myths, Lies & Downright Stupidity"" you get what you see. Its typical John Stossel fare. If you like his style of reporting, writing and analysis you will love the book, if you dont you wont. He makes tons of great points and a lot of his mythbusting is quite enlightening. Stossel often pushes the point that you need to think for yourself and look at the facts before forming what you think is a truth. The only problem is it often leaves me wondering if Stossel himself is telling the truth or if hes only telling what he believes to be the truth. I am not questioning Stossels credibility but at times he doesnt seem to provide much more then what seems like a professionals opinion which leaves me wondering if what im reading is true or not. Overall this is a great book and I certainly suggest reading it but is everything the truth?"
3,"Intriguing, interesting, thought provoking... but ""light""","I like this book. Not a lot though. The idea is neat: Discredit just about everything we believe to be true which we have learned through the media. Stossel rebukes hundreds of myths with varying levels of detail from cold-hard facts to anecdotal evidence.My problem with this book is there is soooooo much anecdotal evidence and so few cold-hard facts. Rather than throw a couple hundred myths at us... I would have preferred Stossel dig in to a dozen or so in greater detail. Just my opinion.This is a good light read. It is easy to read for 5-15 minutes and then put down. Most myths are dispelled in less than two pages. You may find yourself wondering ""is there more to this?"" as he delves into complicated topics like off shoring, agricultural subsidies and crime rates... yet he offers very few facts to support his case, only an example or two, and his examples are often hypothesized. Not really my style... but still, not a bad read."
5,Great toilet book!! Or waiting in traffic book!!,"All ages would love this eye-opening, paradigm-shifting, truth-telling book. Quick snippets of factual information to digest that debunk what you thought you knew to be true. Agenda's revealed! Love it!"
1,"John Stossel has taken Republican Swift Boat Gestapo Radio's ""HATE AND GREED"" and brought it to TV.","Ever since I saw millionaire attacking the subhumans earning minimum wages as worthless, unless they serve in Vietnam or Irag so cowards like John Stossel, Rush Limbaugh and Neal Boortz could avoid service...maybe John made a right Turn at Hawaii and ended up in Alaska. But he is a grest WAR PROFITEER.I picked this book up at Barnes and Noble and wasn't surprised that he is a bully in this book like he is in real life.Edward R. Murrow was a journalist and had integrity.John Stossel is a jounalist the same way Joseph Goebbels was. And a crappy human being at that. Maybe he and David Horowitz and Bernard Goldberg are in a contest to see who can be the biggest liar and bully at the same time."
1,Keep your money,"This book sounds interesting until you open it and start reading. What I don't like about it is the methodology to dispute ""facts."" While a given theory is smashed into pieces a new one, supposedly correct one is provided BUT, isn't there always a but? :), there are minimal or just no facts given to support the new, supposedly correct theory. This book therefore becomes nothing more than he said, she said type of argument. No point in buying it."
1,He flips and he flops. Doesn't address the real mess that needs to be cleaned up.,"Perhaps he would like to tell us why he was a ""liberal"" turned ""conservative"" all the while having no respect for genuine liberalism or genuine conservatism as his hate America book spews forth. Sorry Mr. Stossell but you can't keep telling people to love America by hating each other. If you want to join the amoral and the destructive, read this book and jump off the cliff with him. However, if you really want to help clean up the mess in this country, a Beltway idiot like Stossell isn't the answer. Instead, I'd recommend Thomas Frank and David Sirota for America's real cure."
4,Everything???,"I was already a fan of John Stossel's TV segments, now I can say the same about his writing. This is pretty much a collection of stories he's done for television. Well researched and put together as his work always is, and quite honest when revealing how he blindly fell for many of the thoughts and ideas exposed in the book.A word of caution... if you are in love with your ideals and way of thinking about many items in today's culture, don't read this book. He just might challenge you to re-evaluate them."
1,Too Bad - I used to like him,"I used to enjoy watching John Stossel on 20/20 and looked forward to getting this book. I enjoyed it, for the most part, until I got to his pathetic reasoning behind why homosexuality is normal. His credibility went right down the toilet at that point and in the future I won't consider him, as I used to, a credible source for common sense."
4,Fun Reading,"The writer keeps you entertained and opens your eyes and your mind (if that is possible, only you and your true friends know). Do yourself a favor, buy the book, read it, and encourage others to do the same."
3,A Lot of Stuff,"While I enjoyed some of the things that Stossel told me, I felt that he tried to stuff too much into a very small space allowed for each topic. It is certainly not true that everything I know is wrong, nor is it true that everything he says is right. It's another book of interesting topics that got me thinking, but certainly did not supply the kind of answers I look for."
2,The Amazing Secrts of the Masters of the Far East,"The same information you will find in any of the thousands of success books around today : set your goals, focus on them, persevere.The author has put an eastern spin on it to differentiate his book from others, although it adds nothing. One must realize that the first edition of this book was printed in 1956 so most of what is around today probably drew from this book."
4,Graphic SF Reader,"Here you get the brief super-powered backstory, and what happened to Jewel, and why she gave up the whole hero thing.Luke Cage and the very nasty depradations of the Purple Man appear as major parts. It is all quite sordid. What do you expect an egotistical super villain with mind control will get up to?"
3,Wilbur's hung up on himself,"It's difficult to discuss what I liked and disliked ""Wilbur"" without delving into plot developments that are best left to the viewer to experience for herself. Suffice to say that Wilbur wants to kill himself and after numerous attempts, the hospital refuses to continue treating him psychologically and sends him to live with his generously compassionate brother. Alternately quirky and sad, but never morbid, the question around which the events unfold is whether Wilbur will eventually succeed or get over himself.The film is enjoyable enough, though I never felt much empathy with the characters. The quirkiness is both endearing (in that way that so many Scottish and Irish comedies are) and, at the same time, worn like an affectation. On balance, I liked it, but wouldn't watch it more than once."
1,honestly?????,"A movie about someone trying to kill himself and ...Honestly? Even the title didn't make me want to see this, but after 20 minutes of boredom, I simply had to turn it off. It was going nowhere, except a land of despair which wasn't interesting in the least.It's too bad really because the film has a great cast."
3,Not what I expected.,"The Title is;A Field Guide to Trains of North America. I was not necessarily looking for Steam locomotives, but a broader range of diesels and electrics.I personally love Streamliners, and this book contained 6 pages total on what I believe to be the finest style of trains ever built. What was the finalstraw so to speak was no actual pictures, but all hand drawings.What I can do now is identify most newer locomotives. The book is not useless, but you must be willing to take what is offered, and learn."
5,I love this cookbook!,"I am just learning to cook, and this book has worked perfectly for me! The dishes are easy to make and great for week night dinners as well as dinner parties!"
5,Orwellian,"Feed reminded me of Orwell's 1984 in the dystopia that he describes. How do you like that big word? Like Orwell, Anderson looks at current social, economic, political, and environmental trends then imagines a future path that we may be headed towards. This is one of the more thought provoking and disturbing novels I've ever read."
4,Everything must go!,"The book ""Feed"" by M.T. Anderson was a very interesting book. It gave me an impression of the future and yet it seems like we are living that future now. I would definitely recommend this book to others, because it warns people and lets them know what might be happening with technology and how it has taken over our lives."
3,Great message,Feed is a book which is somewhat slow moving. The book makes use of needless vulgarity and coined words/net speak which seems rather distracting from the moral of the story. It is however a story which serves the purpose of allowing children to grow through the story and provides some good moral thought.
2,"Very depressing, and not that good","Feed presents an extremely depressing dystopian future. The author seems to have no respect for humanity. Everyone is an idiot, even the President. Everyone is shallow. That makes it hard to identify with anyone in the story. Nothing really happens in the entire book. The writing style is an interesting experiment, using a teen-speak slang throughout. An indictment of youth culture, the whole book comes off as a ""These kids today..."" diatribe that every generation has heaped on the next. Guess what? The world, even the teenage world, is not so one-dimensional. Read ""Brave New World"" instead."
3,Feed Review,"Although the concept is intriguing, the book almost becomes too wrapped up in its own attempt to make a political point regarding ""if America stays on its current path, then THIS is where we will end up"". The reader is taken to a dystopian future United States where society's current problems have been taken to extremes. The other aspect I did not care for was the writing style. The reader has to continually attempt to decode the protagonist's jargon and his jarring speech pattern, which I know some people found interesting, but I found disruptive to my ability to become engrossed in the story. Overall, a neat concept, but not a book I plan on ever reading again...and if I could go back, I would never have spent the money on."
2,Delightful - But Too Pricey,"This is an enjoyable beginner's French language reader. It's short and un-intimidating. The vocabulary develops naturally, incrementally with the story lines, in a way that builds confidence. 'Children's book' is an apt description of the characters and situations, but it doesn't cloy for an adult learning the language. The illustrations are a pleasure and useful because they support the text. Unfortunately this is a very pricey introduction to French at just less than sixty pages. It's as if the publishers tossed it into a very crowded market without much forethought. Better to have planned a series of these booklets to develop a following or as an incentive to adopt a packet of them in an educational setting."
2,You Can Take A Chance...,"with this toy like I did. Even though I had already read several reviews stating that the battery compartment leaked, I thought that somehow ""my"" fish would not leak and would work great. I was wrong. Mine didn't even last as long as some other reviewers' had. It swam around for maybe a half an hour and that was it. So back to Amazon it went. But, just to let you know, Amazon was terrific with the return and even printed out a return shipping label. Great service!"
3,Worth the Money,"I bought the Swimways Rainbow Reef Fish to add a little flair to the pool and to entice my three Schnauzers into the pool. It's definitely worth the money I spent on it, and the dogs are very interested in catching it."
4,Realistic and educational,"We ran into this toy at Toys 'R' Us and were immediately drawn to it (as was our toddler). It was swimming around a small circular pool like a real live fish. It's very realistic (the more water you put it in, the better, as the noise it makes gets dampened) and it's highly educational for your children, as they can see the movement of the fish's back fin and how it propels it forward allowing it to swim.On the downside, it's kind of creepy at times, precisely because of how realistic it is. Also it has a very strong smell of plastic when you pull it out of its packaging. Other than that, it's a great toy for a pool or a large tub (it may need more room than your typical pool to swim, as most fish would). :)"
1,Not much to it!,I will not be renewing this magazine. I just got it yesterday and it was very bland vs. my other photo magazines!
5,Muy buena,"Buen servicio, hermosas revistas, comenzaron a llegar solo a las 2 semanas de haberlas comprado asi que puedo decir que ha sido rapido el envio ..."
5,Best ever,This shovel is the best. It gets right down to the concrete. There is no thin layer of ice or snow left on the ground. With all the snow we have gotten this week I am going to order another one.
2,"Bugs, Beetles, siders, snakes","The pictures are great, but that's about the only positive comment I can make about this book. It's main purpose is to identify bugs and snakes, it certainly could not be used as a reference for school reports etc.My main problem is about a third or more of the ""critters"" listed do not reside in the US, so unless I plan on traveling to South America anytime soon, this book is not very useful to me.It seems most of the bugs and snakes are of the more exotic variety and not likely to be seen anywhere but a zoo."
3,Too Minnesota,"Covers some good material needed for modern macro analysis, but gets so excited about the math that it forgets to actually do much economics. This book may be mainly authored by Chicago types, but it is Minnesota to its core. Yuck.A good book if you think you are smarter than most and like to show that off. A bad book if you like to do economics and want to see the payoff that actually (really!) can result from learning some reasonably complex math.But I do conceed, can be a useful reference and despite all the greek, a few interesting points fall out in between the equations."
5,It was just what I needed!,"I am an amateur golfer who is always afraid to play under competition.After watching this video, I feel that my golf game has changed forever!!I can now follow the instructions on the Psychology video and eliminate all fear from my golf swing.I strongly recommend this tape.It was great!"
5,A five star adventure epic!,"A master of deception and disguise, Andea Orsini plays his hand well, rising from the place of a simple peasant blacksmith, first to General and then to Lord! He thwarts the venemous Ceasar Borgia on every turn, befriends a man with the look of Judas, and serves as the protector of a true lady - all the while fighting his own physical and spiritual battles and growing in character along the way.A clever and decidedly well written story of both heroic deeds and great deceptions, true love and the pride of men. You won't be wasting your time on this book, it's five-star material."
5,"Creepy, scary, magnetic!","I love to read stuff from fellow paranormal authors, and this one was enthralling, to say the least. This book was so scary, I was genuinely afraid to keep reading it, yet I could not keep from picking it back up every time I tried to put it down. The characters are so scared and freaked out themselves, that their emotions come right through the pages and into the reader's heart. Could I buy a Buick again? I don't think so!!! Thanks, Stephen!Susan Kelley, AuthorGhostly Encounters of the Paranormal Kind"
2,Not horribly interesting,"I was somewhat disappointed in this book, it never seemed to really go anywhere and I kept waiting for something to actually happen. I love Steven King, but this book just wasn't him."
2,Definitely not his best,"Has an interesting premise, but the narrative structure is really sloppy---he switches around between numerous characters' POV, all in 1st-person narrative, but there is no clear delineation of each separate character's voice---it sounds like the same person talking all the time, which is confusing. And the ending makes no sense. Not one of his best!"
2,Very slow and somewhat boring,"Stephen King is a great writer, but this is definitely not one of my favorites. Yes, I've read all his statements about how he likes to write different things, etc. To me, this one was ""bad"" different as opposed to ""good"" different. The plot is almost non-existing, and the characters and pretty boring as well. The book was extremely hard to get through. If you liked ""Desperation"" or ""Insomnia"" - this is a totally different kind of book. Not a bad book, but not a book I would recommend."
1,A SNOOZE FEST!!,"I have read this book a couple of month's ago. It was in Holland already published.I picked it up after the very, in my opinion, poor black house and wanted it to be a wonderfull book....I'm sorry....it isn't!The story lacks tension and I found it to be a bit of a bore.It didn't "" come alive "" for me, the characters didn't do anything for me...quite frankly...I just didn't care for them.And the story just went on, and on, and on..a complete let down. It's not that I dislike books who builds up ,( i finished "" the emperor of ocean park"" Great book!!) but this just isn't going anywhere.I wrote it before, no more king for me, alas."
1,There's Just Something About This Book.....,"that never really got me into it. I love Stephen King, he's the greatest author of modern time but the story and characters never interested me. If you want classic King buy the Green Mile, Stand(if your up to reading that much), or the Dead Zone."
2,You can't miss with great material . . .,". . . unless you've already used it once . . . So let me guess--- King's next book is about a family who work as caretakers at a deserted resort hotel in the mountains that is actually a gateway to another evil dimension. But it won't be the same as The Shining, because this deserted resort hotel in the mountains--- that is actually a gateway to another evil dimension--- where this new family works as caretakers, is in Vermont this time."
3,Ranks as one of his worst,"SK is still the master and this book is still a decent read, but it is not one of his best and I would only recommend it to SK fans. If you are just getting into the world of SK, please put this at the bottom of your list and read ""The Shining"" ""Salem's Lot"" ""The Stand"" ""The Dead Zone"" ""Carrie"" and the ""The Talisman"" before this one!"
2,Struggling Through,"I have to consider myself one of the biggest Stephen King fans in the world.....however; it does not deter me from stating how disappointed I was in ""From a Buick 8"".I read the book from cover to cover, but not with ease. Of all of his novels, this one by far was the hardest to ""become"" part of and the easiest to put down. I continually found myself drifting while reading. I agree with most other reviews that this book is WAY too long to hold anyone's interest for too long.Then only comfort I find is knowing this is not the norm for Mr. King and I can expect this to be a one-time disappointment for me."
4,Middle of the road King; it's still fun.,"""From a Buick 8"" is neither King's best nor his worst. It strikes me as about average for his recent (ie: post-accident) books. Still, it is a fun read. If the story lacks a bit in the substance department, it is more than compensated by King's always reliable story TELLING talents. I swear the man could make a recounting of what he had for breakfast interesting. Bottom line: if you are new to King, there are better titles of his that I'd recommend to cut your teeth on; if you're a King fan, ""From a Buick 8"" is a worth while notch to add to your belt."
4,Solid King thriller with an unusual twist,"""From a Buick 8"" is not King's best novel, but its nowhere near his worst, either. Its an unusual little tale about the nature of our obessesion with dangerous and deadly forces, and about how there aren't always explanations for what we want. I found the book to be creepy, and it has an everpresent sense of dread looming over it. This is not exactly great material for a movie adaption, but a thoroughly enjoyable and spooky novel. Worth checking out."
2,Not Good At All,"I love Stephen King.....at least I used to. I have read a lot of King's works and loved most all of them. But, recently it seems that his novels are starting out well and captivating the reader, but by midway through it leaves you wondering why you are reading this. This book is no exception. It doesn't hold the reader enough to make them want to finish the book. Unlike King's earlier works that the reader simply cannot put down or the reader has ngihtmares about! This is not one of those books.If you are reading King for the first time...DO NOT read this one. Try Dolores Claiborne, Carrie, or Everything's Eventual instead. The last is the best sample of true King works.I gave it 2 stars, but if it weren't King writing it would have gotten less than 1. Sorry Stevie, I love ya, but we need to get back to the good stuff!"
3,Not Great But Not Bad,"This book is definitely not Stephen King's best work (and may actually be among his worst)but it was okay. Not much of a story, but I love his style of writing."
4,Entertaining and interesting metaphor,"Stephen King reflects on life, age, the passage of time and those who get swallowed up by circumstances along the way, some of their own creation, some are random... and some from what looks like a vintage Buick Roadmaster. I guess the supernatural aspect is always going to put some people off. It's too bad those people can't see that the story is in fact not about the supernatural stuff at all."
3,Dissapointingly Boring..,"I'm going to spare you the boredom and keep this short, advice I wish S.K. would've followed. If you are a hardcore S.K. fan, go ahead and check it out. Otherwise I'd skip it and use your time more wisely reading one of his others, or someone else entirely. From a Buick 8 was boring to say the least, and with nararrations of what happened in the past, there is next to no suspense throughout. Hopefully this is NOT his last book, because this would be one terrible way to leave the writing world."
1,My Favorite Writer out of Gas,"Hard to resist all the car references ""out of gas "" ""wreck"". Hard to believe this is the same writer who wrote The Stand,The Shining,It and Salem's Lot. Where's the mystery, where's the horror -good lord where's the story ? Sorry Steve , guess it is time to retire -maybe a few years off ,will refresh your enormous talent . This is one of the most tedious books ,I ever finished [only finished because it was written by Stephen King].Is full of adjectives and page fillers ala Dean Koonce ,but is pretty dull stuff. Happy retirement Steve and thanks for the memories."
2,Tedious,"I've really enjoyed many of Stephen King's books and, when he's on, he's probably the best at mixing suspense and terror in a story. I really believe he has a gift very few authors in this genre have.That said, Buick 8 just dragged on, never really going anywhere. I normally knock off about 100-150 pages a day when reading his other novels. This one took me about 2 weeks and it was a chore the whole time.I look to King to spook me at night, not give me the warm and fuzzies. It was pretty clear he wanted to go in a different direction with his writing but he should stick with what he's best at. I go to my CPA becuase he's the best at doing my taxes. He doesnt change my oil or rotate my tires.Mr. King, get back to scaring the bejeezus outta me!"
1,What?,"What is this book about? About a third of the way through, I realized I didn't care. Its now on the shelf and I still don't care. It should be a writers job to keep us entertained at least halfway through a book, Buick 8 can't even do that..."
3,Very readable but without true substance,"I believe we King readers judge the great author harder than we grade other authors. If anyone other than Stephen King had written Buick 8, I'd have written this as a four star review and said it was a very original, engaging, well composed story. Masterfully told using different narrators and points of view. A perfect combination of science-fiction, horror, suspense and nostalgia.But this novel was written by Stephen King and as a fan of his work, I've read better books by him. Much better. For King, this book is not especially original and reminded me of many of his others. Still, it was, like I find all his others, very readable but without the true substance I always hope I will find between the book covers of a novel authored by Stephen King."
2,"back to reality, please","King needs and editor who can look him in the eye and tell him when a book isn't worth the millions people are about to shell out for it. This should have been a short story, not the endless sleeper I'm struggling to finish."
3,"Not His Best, But Still Good","This is a book about human curiosity. Unlike some other King books, Buick 8 lacks the clear and obvious antagonist. The real antagonist is a human beings search for answers when there are no clear answers.Also, this book is written with a lot of flashbacks. Buick 8's story is told by a group of PA State Troopers to a teenager whose father was killed a year before. Incidently, the boys father was on the the troopers that took a fascination to the Buick.The story also consists of many excellent descriptions of light shows and alien creatures which are spawned from the Buick.However, despite King's excellent writing, I could not give this 5 stars because the story tends to drag and the climax (although not a dissapointment) is not of the quality the author has shown in his previous novels. But nonetheless, I would still recommend this book to King readers."
4,Fun read,Loved it! Couldn't put it down. Totally fun read. Its the suspense more than the horror that gets to you on this one (although there is lots of yuck factor). King's deceptively easy writing style breezes you right through a story that actually has quite a bit of depth.
5,"essential and powerful release, a must have...","This is the most 'metal' of the Brains albums and it features HR for the last time in full possession of his awesome, evocative voice. Ron St. Germains' production is flawless: the drums are tight and powerful, the bass has earl's fat, growling tone fully intact, Dr. Know's guitars are at their most metallic and edgy, and HR's vocals are captured and exploited to perfection...from inhuman screeching throat noises to tremulous moans to full-bore primal screams to sweet and moving reggae crooning. the songs are solid and bear repeated listens...Soul Craft is particularly brutal and fun to listen to, while Yout Juice continues I against I's melodic pop-punk-metal vein flawlessly...GET THIS ALBUM. after this HR was never the same..."
4,Clean And Tough,"The Bad Brains' most cohesive album since the ROIR debut, this CD cracks and sizzles with intensity. Cro-Mags drummer Mackie replaces Earl Hudson for this set (reason unknown). The production is amazing (via a guy who formerly worked with James Brown, among others), and HR gives up the vocal performance of his life. A four-star album. Excepting the fact that Mackie is not Earl, this album would receive five. Essential and perhaps their greatest work, certainly the easiest on the ears."
5,This book is fabulous and wonderful.,"I could not believe how much information was packed into these 160 pages. The author did a great deal of research and understands that romance is a beautiful concept. There is no book on the market like this book. It is artful, descriptive,enlightening, educational, inspirational, and heart felt. The author has inspirational quotes from the best writer in the industry.This book has a chance to be a bestselller if properly marketed. All I ever learned in life I learned from romance novels is a book for both men and women and what motivates them to be together."
1,Celiacs Avoid This Product,"The product states it is gluten free, however it contains barley and oat grass, which can be gluten free, but if there are seeds present it will absolutely contain gluten. This product made me sick for weeks until I finally figured out what I was consuming that contained gluten, after reading other reviews."
3,Not sure if it's doing anything,I've had chronic candidiasis for several years and have not noticed any improvement since starting this. I know it's a long process to fix this condition so I plan to continue taking these for a while in case they are doing something.
5,Great for reducing severity of illness and speeding recovery.,"I've found these to be great at both reducing the severity of my cold/flu and for speeding the recovery. You can smell the garlic in them, one of the ingredients. I'd highly recommend them."
2,Worked well but I became concerned about safety,"I researched HSOs and became concerned when I read that they are effective at killing candida etc BUT they colonize your digestive system and then stay there forever! There are safer ways to address candida, I believe, with non-colonizing organisms or the kinds of organisms that are normally found in balance in our bodies."
3,Dogs of God abook review,"The book was very informative. It dealt with a period in time, that I was not well informed about. After finishing the book I felt that people degrade religion and shape it the way they want. The writer had a double standard in that he exposed the the mistreatment of the Jews but he did not care about the mistreatment of the Muslems who were also forced to leave or get peptized!"
2,warmed-over cliches,"As some of the reviews below suggest (albeit approvingly), this is a one-sided rehash of the modern cliches about this era: the Christians retaking their land are evil and intolerant; the Muslims who violently seized these lands in the first place are noble and benificent. I look forward to reading Mr. Reston's forthcoming book on the bloody Muslim conquests of the Middle East, northern Africa, the Iberian Peninsula, Turkey and the Balkans, and their forcible conversion of millions throughout those lands, which were once predominantly Christian. That should be a ripping good read.I give it two stars because at least the prose is lively."
1,Even propagates the Flat Earth Myth,"What can one say...An exciting read but one of the worst researched books I have seen.How far it is from the work of a well read historian is proven also when one reads (page 178) that the ""prelates on the commission were stuck in the conventional interpretations of the Bible"" and hence asked ""How could the world be a globe?"".Obviously a hack job based on Washington Irving's infamous invention of a medieval belief in a flat earth, from his Columbus biography (from 1828).Such nonsense in a book from 2005 makes it hard to take it seriously, ref. Russell's ""Inventing the Flat Earth: Columbus and Modern Historians"", http://www.amazon.com/Inventing-Flat-Earth-Columbus-Historians/dp/027595904X/"
3,FYI,"The title should have been the first clue. This reference contains thousands of books that are already leveled by the companies who sell them in bundles of six. I was hoping that this resource would have more trade books written by authors whose intent is to engage and entertain children. As the levels increase, the number of trade books does too, but the majority of books are already leveled."
3,Not the usual Binchy,"Although the story was a good one, it was not the usual Maeve Binchy. The mini character stories were choppy and not developed in the usual Binchy fashion. I did not feel like I knew the characters as well as the other Binchy books."
3,Didn't love it.,"The face of the watch is quite large--even for a man's watch. We didn't love the band, either."
3,Fun kids book which puts children in the middle ofhistory. not a true tale.,"Please do not repesent this book as historical fact but as interesting fiction based around plots to kill Washington. We have enough trouble overcoming historical innacuracies taught in school: wooden teeth, cherry tree, etc. There is currently no contemporary information to support the Phoebe story which changes greatly over time."
5,"The best rally game out there, hands down.","Without any doubt, this is probably one of the best rally games out there.The graphics are unbeatable for the Playstation and are eye-popping. All of the details on Colin's and the other cars are very accurate.The gameplay is exceptional. CMR2 now features Arcade mode for an extra option than just Rally mode. The track selection in Arcade mode ranges in difficulty, and a few secret tracks will also become available after winning championships.Rally mode is even better than the first CMR with a very wide selection of rallies with the same 9 stages for each rally.Basically, there aren't any serious drawbacks. The control will be loose because it's a rally car. And in the WRC, there is no such thing as a racing line. So everything's about sliding.Without any doubt, It's definitely a must-buy and makes a great gift to an international motorsports fan."
2,Lunch Lessons- Not A Cookbook,"I guess I was thinking the was more of a cookbook, but instead it IS a Lesson, or more like a lecture on lunch programs.Good if you are interested in the subject, but only offers very minimum recipes and NO Pictures. Could have been better... (not worth the $$.) Check it out at the library first before you purchase.Wish it had 1/2 on the suject and 1/2 on recipes with good pictures to get you motivated."
1,Not so great,I thought it would be more recipes and it actually had very few. It is mostly nutritional talk and statistics. The few recipes they do have are NOT lunch box friendly and are not things kids will eat.
3,Quimper Compact,A useful compact book to carry around with you while in France.The price guide dated 1998 needs updating.
4,Great DVD,"I was looking for the making of ""We are the World"" for a long time and I was glad I've found this. The only thing I have against this DVD is that it does not have any international support, I mean there's not even an english subtitle, not to mention other languages. If you're a native english speaking person interested in the story, I highly recommend you this. It covers not only the making, but about a six month period of what happened after in details."
4,classic dvd,I purchased this to replace my video copy. This DVD is a must just because of the historical nature and to have a visual record of so many of the favorite stars of today and bygone eras.
5,Toook Me Back!!!!,"I love this, I have it in my computer now as a matter of fact. Not only do you see the video, you see many of them reheasing. The quality is perfect and you feel like you sre there losing the watching feeling for the you are there feeling. If you can remeber when We Are the World came out you will want this."
2,Too much screaming,"Now, I'm not against screaming in music...because i like bands such as demon hunter, living sacrifice, soul embraced, and others. But in this type of music, I don't think a ton of screaming really fits into it. But then again, that's basically what screamo is, punk rock with a bunch of screaming. And it really gets on my nerves. There are actually about 4 songs on the cd that I like. I like the songs where the lead singer actually sings, because he has a really good voice. But when the screamer guy starts screaming...it just really annoys me."
2,go ti for chirstmas,"screamo spazz rock obviously dont get em wrong i love ""dead by dawn"" and ""mouth like a maazine"". but 7-8 people is way to many ppl for a band, you cant understand the screams even with the lyrics and there's to many screamo s***. buy it if you want but there's way better stuff out there"
5,Should be mandatory prior to first platoon or company command.,"This is my second reading of these three related novels. First rate. I am a retired Army colonel, armor and air cavalry. This should be required reading at basic officers courses as well as CGS. The insights into leadership, command at all levels, and especially atrocious commanders and staff officers are esential to officer development. When I assumed command of a platoon, and later a tank company, I did not have a clue. The Lieutenants and The Captains would have made me a better officer -- at least knowing what a leader was as opposed to an administrator."
4,A very good case for Tungsten C.,"As it was said by the previous reviewr, this case is very good and leave spaces for the places you need to access. It is a very good case for Tungsten C. I highly recommend it to Tungsten C users.The reason I gave it 4 stars instead 5 is that I personally prefer that the cover can be opened left, not right."
3,Not as good as I expected,"The perfum smells delicious, and the presentation of the product is nice,but the aroma lasts only a short time, and this is a very importantvalue in an eau the toilette, one expects to last longer."
1,Beer Nuts,The nuts were stale and tastless. I tried to get a refund but you said it could not be refunded. I threw them out.
1,Save Your Money!,"I would feel better throwing my money in the toilet than buying this toy. It's too small and will never look like it does on the box because it's NEVER in one piece. In fact, the box is worth more than the toy. It's going in the trash today!"
2,Don't bother,"My son asked for this toy when he was 3 and he got it for christmas. Not even a uear later it was in the trash. It was fun for a little while, but very flimsy. I wish I never bought it."
2,Silly Soccer Mess,"I have two boys who are one and a half and two and a half. I Have purchased a lot of toys for my kids and this has to be the worst purchase I have ever made. The pieces are constantly falling off, the goal is way to small and my kids lost interest in it two minutes after it was put together. I am sad to say it was a complete waste of money. I would have been better off simply walking over the the toilet and flushing this bad investment right down the drain. This toy is completely horrible in design and makes me wonder if it was ever tested out on any child before sent out on the market.I feel cheated."
1,sorry I got it,"I'm very sorry I got this. I bought this for my daughter last year for Christmas she was 4 then. She didn't hate it but she didn't play with it either. Then when she did got to play with it the hands fell off, then the sides fell off. Not worth the money. I couldn't even sell it for .50 at a tag sale this summer. I ended up chucking it instead."
1,HORRIBLE!!!!!!!,"This is the worst toy we own. If the pieces aren't falling off, then my son (2 years) can't get the ball in the goal because it is way to small. Its comments are also way to derogatory for the age group it is intended for. TERRIBLE (...)"
4,about DVDfilm/movie Wassup Rockers..............,"The film basically talk about a group of bad tennager that cause bad things to happen (died of 2 person) and the story end after they return home. These teenagers are board skaters and these actors did well in this film by showing their bad behaviour as a tennager but the story of the trouble is more story based rather than the kind of violent reaction which a bad tennager may have which include fighting etc etc. Larry Clark is been praised on the first portion of the film that show more toweards reaction of how these tennager act......that's all...recommended to those whom are interested in this genre of film.Wassup RockersReview written by:Dr, MR Franc MBBS (PhD) GPS Ang Poon Kah"
5,Captivating Cali,"If this is not one of the most beautiful places of earth, I don't know what is. I have always been a huge fan of Robert Cameron's work, he is just nothing short of an amazing talent. This book features some of his most spectacular work. Quite frankly, it would be hard to make this amazingly beautiful place look anything less than awe inspiring, but Cameron actually makes it more breathtaking, I find myself picking up this book from time to time just to remember that there are places this incredible. This is a wonderful book on an amazing place and I highly recommend it to anyone who appreciates great beauty and god given talent."
2,not so great,this mat gets very slippery and makes even simple moves frustrating. i would recommend a different mat.cheers
1,Where are the special features?,"Although I read the book this movie is based on and loved the film when it was released by Disney back in 1991, I was very disappointed that it didn't have any of the Special Features that warrant a DVD release. There wasn't any footage of how Disney used special effects to make it look like those horses were jumping off a 40-foot platform. There wasn't any interviews of actress Gabrielle Anwar nor any mention that the real Sonora Webster was impressed with how this actress accurately portrayed her. I would have rather bought the VHS and saved myself money."
1,amazing,"I found the movie to be very loosely based on the true story...according to Sonora's autobiography ""A girl and Five Brave horses"" Sonora was NOT an orphan and she did not train an arabian named lightning....that being said its a fun movie but it sure has been changed from the REAL Story."
1,Out of Region,"This movie does not play on my DVD player. Gives an error saying ""out of region"". Can be played on a computer though."
5,She Never Gave Up Hope And Believed In Herself,"I think that this is one of the most wonderful movies I have ever seen. I have just finished watching it and I had forgotten how much I loved it. It is the story of a strong girl who leaves home because her Aunt doesn't treat her very well. She goes to find the man who runs a horse diving show and she joins, but he won't let her ride because he thinks she can't but she shows him that she won't give up and that she is strong. So she and the owners son, Al, train a horse that nobody can control and he says, ""If you can get on that horse while he's moving you can train to be a diving rider."" ANd that is all I can tell you but I really think that everyone should seee it.It is a story of never gicing up hope, and it is true which makes it even more wonderful. As I said befor I think that everyone would like this movie."
3,"Did the screen writer, Director or anyone read the books?","The Half Blood Prince and HP7 have lost the charm and magic of the stories; no one expects the movies to be the same as the books but these leave the viewer (me) cold. I wonder was J.K. Rolling an advisor on these movies?There is no time spent on the death of Dobbie, and many other touching sections of the book that bring the drama of the decision to go after the ""Hollows"" or the Horcruxes. I found the changes in ""The Half Blood Prince"" totally useless; Malfoy's mother is a complete wreck emotionally because of Lucius' imprisonment and the task set for her son and yet she shows up at Snape's all dressed up in makeup, heels, etc., oh well thankfully it will finally be over in July. Perhaps in 10 years or so someone like Peter Jackson will take a look and say ""let's do these stories justice"" or not."
3,Perfect for those trying to complete their collection.,I gave this movie 3 stars because it seemed a little slow. They seemed to have taken all of the action from the last book and stuck it in the second part of the movie. This would have been better as one whole long movie...but still a must have for any Harry Potter fan...and definitely a keeper to complete your DVD collection.
5,Surprisingly good,"Despite the reviews that said the movie was stuck in the woods and terrible, Part 1 was surprisingly good. In fact, it was LESS disappointing than Part 2--which I saw in 3D IMAX for too much money--I have to admit. The Harry Potter-Hermione fantasy that had people up in arms and was not in the book was hilarious!"
4,Ordered on Roku,"Quality was okay on our Samsung 1080p TV. Wish that the 2nd half was available for renting, hopefully it will be there soon!"
4,harry potter and the deathly hallows part 1,"I wanted the 2 disc special edition dvd and I got it, but it didn't have a slipcase which I kind of wanted. It's ok at least I have the entire hp collection."
1,2011 BluRay DVD combo & 2 disc DVD special edition,"I love the Harry Potter series. This is not a review about the movie itself. Go to IMDB for that. This is a review of the product. I am a total visual quality snob. This is without a doubt one of the worst movie transfers I have ever seen. HORRIBLE!!! I bought the 2 disc special edition DVD first. My initial thought was that Warner Bros had purposefully sabotaged the DVD quality in order to provoke people into investing in BluRay, which would then reveal the true potential of quality. So I returned the 2 disc special edition DVD for the DVD/BluRay combo. Alas! The BluRay was just as horrible. I know it's hard to wait, but I would really encourage people to NOT let Warner Bros make a profit on such a shoddy product: reject this release. Maybe they will get the hint that with general sales getting lower and lower each year, that they can't just abuse their customers without consequences."
1,Great movie on a horrible disc,"If you're interested in this excellent movie, buy a different version...this one was so poorly done, so over-compressed, that characters' heads jumped around by several pixels while standing still, and faces were occasionally obscured by football-sized ""artifacts"" -- junk on the screen that should not have been there. Yuck! We'll be upgrading to one of the multi-disc versions and hoping that the compression was better done there."
4,A Good Combo,"If you're a fan of the movie, this is a good combo to have. It has all the formats you'll need."
2,painfully slow and boring,very disappointing after having enjoyed the previous movies so much. appears they just threw a bunch of long drawn out scenes on film to extract more cash from all the potter fans.
5,great,"I bought this for my son for Christmas, it was less than half the price at good ol wally world"
3,Eh?,No gripes about the disc quality or amazon. But the movie itself was pretty weak. Boring story line and difficult to understand what the actors are saying. The accents combined with the special effects sounds made some moments completely incomprehensible.
4,The First Part of the Epic Conclusion!!!,"Over the past few years, I've lost a little interest in the Harry Potter series, but I have to see it through 'til the end. This first part was fast-paced and decent, but kinda dragged a little bit toward the end, like it was hurrying to get to the second part. After the death of Dumbledore, Harry, Ron and Hermione drop out of Hogwarts in order to find and destroy the last Horcruxes in order to kill Voldemort. In Dumbledore's last will and testament, Harry receives the Golden Snitch. Ron receives the Deluminator, and Hermione gets a book. Each will help in their journey. Harry also must find the sword of Godric Gryffindor so they can destroy each Horcrux. I would definitely recommend HARRY POTTER AND THE DEATHLY HALLOWS: PART 1!!!"
4,The end is Nye,"Well after so many books and movie releases we Harry Potter freaks are almost at the end of our tither. Like any series the movies are always catching up with the book so there is always the unknown expectation that the movie will miss the mark as far as the story goes. Deathly Hallows however follows reasonably close to the book which I think is made easier because the producers could stretch it out over two movies, thus capture more closely to the story line then the other HP movies.I still think however that given the intensity of the final book that part 1 missed some opportunities to nail it by digressing a little from the book and that was a bit disappointing.The telling will be in part 2 when all the action really starts and if the producers don't capture it well then it will ruin the whole lot. Of all the movies in the series I rate this my favourite at this point."
2,Pretty. Awful.,"It must be possible these days to feed a text into a machine which transfers words directly to images because, unlike the previous films, Deathly Hallows Part 1 almost resembles the first half of the novel exactly. This unfortunately does not work in the film's favor, precisely because the trend of the last few films was to dispense with a great deal of material from the books (and consequently improve upon them) in favor of giving us films which were incoherent as a series but which, for the most part, stood well on their own aesthetically. And while this more impressionistic style of film-making didn't sit well with the Harry Potter purists, cinematically it was very respectable. Now, however, the filmmakers have decided to give the purists what they want . . . to the detriment of the film, not least because Deathly Hallows the novel was such a mess to begin with."
4,"Expected better lighting, too dark to see action.","The movie itself was good but it was difficult to see everything going on because it was always extremely dark. My son watched it on his computer and it was much better, but we were disappointed in this. We also would have purchased the next one when it comes out - the second part of this story - but now we are wary that it is going to turn out the same way.Incidentally, we now live in Springfield, TN, not California."
3,Harry ?,"Well done film, good acting and SFX. However. My wife enjoys this series, she went to see it at the theaters without our son and myself, (we saved the money and used it to buy her the BluRay). My son and I are no where near the fan she is of this series. Deathly Hallows 1 was a gift for her I knew I'd be forced to watch. I kept falling asleep. She loved viewing the movie again. I prefer movies like Three Days Later, The Perfect Getaway and Insidious. My 2 cents. To each their own."
3,not bad,after long awaiting to watch this movie I found out that it was not quite as good as I expected. The movie is way over hyped but it is watchable.
4,Near end of HP,"Great movie, as they all were. Really enjoyed the series, but defintely preferred the books over the movies! Good overall though!"
4,Harry potter deathly Hallows part 1,"Was okay as I like Harry Potter, but it seems they grew up tp fast. the others was better.good buy."
5,Great,Add to my collection of Harry Potter DVDs. I can watch the series over and over and never get tired of the clever challenges they overcome.
3,"Harry Potter & Deathly Hallows, Part 1","The Movie plot was excellent. The only thing I did not like about this movie was that many scenes were so dark that it was difficult to tell what, exactly, was happening. I imagine it was supposed to be that way, but was not to my liking. Hope Part II is better in that respect."
3,Not too bad,The drama that has boiled through all the films with these 3 friends finally comes to a climax. Not a bad movie but the only reason I can see that they made it is to give more definition to the characters before they ended it. 3 stars
5,Great movie,"This was my first purchase with amazon.com and I was totally satisfied with everything. The movie came as stated, new in package. I will be purchasing items from here again. The experience was very good."
1,This must be the condensed version.,"I started watching this and thought I missed a movie in the series. Not having read the books (although being a fan of the movie series), I found the story confusing and a little tedious. It was a disjointed and convoluted series of scenes mashed together without purpose or reason.In my opinion the entire movie could have been condensed into a brief narrative at the beginning of the next movie (much like this movie started. Referring to events that didn't occur onscreen, but apparently caused major changes to secondary characters and relationships)."
1,Amazing!,"I can honestly say I have never purchased a DVD online (until now) in which I opened the case to find it completely empty inside! No disc, no liner notes, no nothing!Unfortunately I threw out my packing slip before I opened the case (I ordered more stuff and all the ""items"" were included, so I thought all was well). It wasn't until I went to watch the DVD that I realized it wasn't in there!"
1,Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows Part One,Horrible! Actually I suppose the movie is good...IF I EVER GET IT! ORDERED IT OVER A MONTH AGO AND STILL HAS NOT ARRIVED! NEEDLESS TO SAY I AM A BIT PEEVED! NEVER WILL ORDER FROM AMAZON.COM AGAIN!!!!!!!
2,Harrypotter and Deathly hollows Blu-Ray,This Blu-Ray disk is nothing but an SD version and is awfully soft and shadowy--NOT worth the price of the Blu Ray edddition
2,Harry Potter Deathly Hallows Part 1 DVD - very poor video quality for such a significant movie,"The video quality of this DVD is appalling -- dark backgrounds often show very distracting rectangular blocking with an attendant lack of detail. It does seem that the poor quality is probably a marketing attempt to drive sales to the Blu-Ray version -- the preceding movie in the Harry Potter series had far less difference in quality between the DVD and the Blu-Ray versions.In support of the ""marketing caused it"" theory, although the Deathly Hallows Part 1 DVD is a dual-layer disk, only a modest amount of the additional dual layer disk capacity is actually used -- using more of the available capacity would certainly have allowed better quality video."
3,Broken Case!!!,"It's brand new, the movie rocks, but the case came chipped on the inside and it can't close!!! Maybe I'm being picky but seriously? Come on..."
1,DO NOT BUY THIS DVD- NOT FROM AMAZON,"A copy of ""Tangled"" was in our DVD box. Unfortunately, the entire extended family was on vacation and our evening were to be spent in a Harry Potter marathon. This development is unfortunate and compounded by the fact that Amazon cannot replace the DVD as it did not fulfill it in the first place. The whole process is a drag and complete disappointment. Find another source for this particular DVD."
2,too dark,"I have just finished watching, and I am soooo disgusted. With all the money this series has made, you would think they could have some lighting on the set!! The scenes were so dark, I felt like I was squinting through 95% of the movie to see what was happening. I know the story line is ""dark"", but that's no excuse to not be able to see what's happening."
3,Good but Could Use an Edit Job,Advances the story adequately at a slow pace with a few action and comedy pieces. Sometimes got so slow for so long I began to loose interest. Needs a good 20-30 minutes cut out to make it a better film that is more in line with the pacing of the previous Harry Potter films.
1,No French or Spanish audio for DVD,"I also bought the 3-Disc Blu-ray/DVD/Digital Copy Combo Pack offered here on Amazon. The DVD included in this pack contains ONLY the ENGLISH LANGUAGE AUDIO, although the packaging clearly indicates that it includes FRENCH and SPANISH audio. In fact, it states that the French is Canadian French."
4,The Deathly Hallows,After seeing this movie in the theater I decided to order the DVD. I found the quality of the disc outstanding. The movie was also very good and the soundtrack in my home theater room provided even better quality than the theater.
3,"Not my favorite HP film, but it was ok.","The movie was okay. I didn't hate it, but I didn't love it. I watched the DVD five times since its release and I still can't point out any favorite scenes or lines that I like. Overall, the graphics and cinematography were great as always. The Sword of Gryffindor scene was exactly how I pictured it when I read the book, same for the scenes in the Ministry of Magic. The most disappointing scene for me, was the imprisonment at Malfoy manor. It could've been much better in my opinion. But I understand it's still considered a kids film.I still think they did a good job, but I wasn't as 'hyped' about HP7: Part1, as I was with the other previous films. I do think where they chose to end this film was awesome. The very last scene was good. Can't wait for Part 2 :)"
2,The DVD is DARK!,"The DVD is so dark it's unwatchable. The retrieving of the sword scene was completely dark. It was like watching a movie with the sound only. I have waited and waited for this, but instead of getting to enjoy it, it was so DARK I couldn't see anything. Even the daylight scenes were underexposed. I am extremely disappointed. NOT in the movie but in the absolutely dreadfully unacceptable quality of the DVD. I understand I am not the only one having this issue. LOVE the movie, hate the DVD. I am returning it tomorrow. : ("
1,NO DIGITAL COPY INCLUDED!!!,"Even though the description says a digital copy is included, it is NOT. The digital copy offer expired on 9/13/11 and WB will no longer honor the digital copy codes. Huge disappointment."
5,Excellent Movie!,"As a fan, I was thrilled to get the final 2 movies in the series. They came together (YES!!!) and I was able to enjoy them in the right order. They were a day early (thrilled!) and in perfect condition."
5,"Love, Love, Love the movie","Saw this Harry in the movies. Was Great!!! Had to get this movie, because I own all the one's that are out now! It's a little darker than the other Harry movie's, but still a Great movie. Looking forward to the final one!!"
1,Who would pay $99 for this?,Look around $99 for this set is laughingly ridiculous. The single-disc version of this movie is on sale for $4.99 at Christmastime 2011.
2,Way too dark,"I've been disappointed in all the films since David Yates took over as director. Instead of all the beautiful detail of the earlier films, Mr. Yates seems to prefer substituting swirls and darkness for visible representations. Most of the time I can't tell what's going on. If I were not such a devoted Harry Potter fan, I wouldn't purchase any of the Yates DVDs."
2,getting worse,"That acid-trip dance scene inside the tent was the most awkward and worthless 5 minutes of cinema ever created. The rest of the movie was tolerable, but not as entertaining as previous movies of this series. Disappointed."
1,Not worth the money!,"I bought this toy for my 3 & 6 year old daughters because on the TV commercials it looked so cute and lots of fun with all the butterflies blowing out all over. Both my daughters begged for it and so Santa left it under the tree for them and they were so excited and couldn't wait to play with it Christmas morning. Well the toy is cute looking, but that's about as far as it goes. The fan just doesn't have enough power to blow the butterflies out other than maybe 5 or 6 of them. The rest just twirl around at the very bottom. We tried what the instructions say in case of that happening and it still didn't help! Even tried putting another set of brand new batteries in, but still nothing! Definately not worth the money as it's nothing like the TV advertises! Will be returning this toy for a refund!"
1,wouldn't recommend it,"I wouldn't recommmend this game. The butterflies will not fly out even after following the instructions. It seems that the motor is not strong enough. I can't say that more butterflies would be any better seeing how the ones it comes with can't make it past the base. If I hold the base firmly to the ground, it works somewhat better. I foresee a trip to the refund counter with this one."
2,not as fun as it sounds,"I think the idea of this toy is great. There are multiple problems, however. First of all, be prepared to spend a lot of money on batteries, because it uses them up incredibly quick. Second, the fun to work ratio is about 10 seconds to three minutes. The butterflies fly out so quick that you'll find yourself setting it up again before you even realized that it had started. Also, my kids are 5 and 3 and very rarely were they able to actually catch a butterfly in their net. Third, it seems to have a design flaw in that I had to trim the trunk by about 30% in order for the motor to have enough strength to shoot all the butterflies out. Fourth, the nets themselves are very cheaply made and had to be ""fixed"" way too many times. Overall, I would say this toy was a little bit of fun, a whole lot of work, and way too much money wasted. We received ours as a Christmas present in 2003, and it's going out with the trash this week, November 2004."
4,Battery Waster,"My daughter wanted this to for Christmas. So Santa got it for her. After putting brand new batteries in there, it worked great for the first few times. After that, the butterflies kept getting stuck in the base. I've tried everything to get them out. The batteries died after one day of use. My kids were really disappointed. I think this might go back for a refund. Otherwise it will only collect dust on a top shelf somewhere. I'm not going to put new batteries in it everytime they want to use it."
4,Fun!,"My kids 7 and 4 love this toy...they just got it for christmas and it's really easy for them to play with...their only complaint is that there is not enough butterflys...the game doesn't last long enough, after about 30 seconds it blows all the butterflys out and you have to start all over...it would be nice if they came with more butterflys so that the game would keep the kids interested for a little bit longer...other than this its a really fun and easy game for the kids to play!"
1,"A great idea, but it doesn't work!","This is a very cute idea for a toy, and my young child was charmed as we took it out of the box. After we assembled the nets and inserted the batteries, we turned it on and just...waited. Two butterflies came out, and the rest just swirled around inside the base of the toy. Very disappointing, and a waste of money. Buyer beware!"
1,Only works for a few days,"My 2 year old son loved this toy, but after a few days the butterflies wouldn't blow out of the truck. It became frustrating not only for my son, but for my husband and I. I finally trashed it after a few weeks. Don't buy this toy its junk!"
1,"great idea, poor execution","My 2-year-old received this toy as a gift. Immediately, I loved the idea, having never seen this toy before. However, the butterflies exit the trunk at the rate of about 1 per minute! After a while, they stop coming out altogether, even though there are many left. Ah well. I feel worse for the giver than the recipient: dd has plenty of toys, but it feels awful to give a gift and watch it not work appropriately."
2,not as good as it looks on tv,"This would be great--if all the butterflies came up and out! They stick in the trunk due to static electricity, and some don't even make it out of the ""body"" of the elephant. My daughter gets quite frustrated because we keep having to shake the elephant's trunk and ""reload"" the butterflies. I've even tried lightly spraying the butterflies with static guard--they still ""stick""."
3,Theoretically fun - but doesn't really deliver,"If you didn't have to stand around waiting so long for one of the butterflies to come out, it would be fun. But it seems the butterflies just kind of swish around in the elephant and occassionally one will come out. So you're so bored waiting by the time one flies out that you're off guard and no one catches it. You spend most of your time turning it off, taking of the trunk and mixing the butterflies up to try to get them to ""fly"".The photo is very deceiving. It makes it look like you'll have tons of butterflies flying out at once, but in actuality it's only one every couple minutes."
2,waste of money,"The game is adorable only if it could work properly. My twins would wait anxiously for the butterflies but they hardly came out. It eats batteries like crazy. I kept changing batteries and cut the trunk shorter, still few butterflies, most stay inside. Finally I called the company, they sent me a new one. This one worked the same exact way, terrible. It is very frustrating to kids. I wouldn't waste money on it."
1,disappointed,i was very disappointed with this game. the butterflies hardly flew out of the elephants truck. they got stuck on the inside.
2,"My daughter loves it, but it's a pip.","We received this as a gift. The first one didn't work at all. The second one works, and the kids love it, but it's heavy parental involvement. The kids who would be interested in this are too young to screw off the elephant's head in order to put the butterflies in and get the game started again and screw the head back on again. The game is over in less than 2 minutes, and then mom or dad must get involved to re-load the elephant. My daughter and her friends love it. They're all around 4-5. Also, you have to make absolutely sure that the elephant's trunk extends all the way up in the air in order for the butterflies to fly out. The kids are all too short to do this, so guess who has to help? In addition, the motor seems to be going bad on this second one; I don't think it will last. It's only one week old."
2,Elefrustrating,"The game is a really great concept however, there is much the consumer should be warned about before the purchase is made. The nets are not put together and the assembly is far from easy. I actually broke one of them attempting to get it together. Also, the game comes with little paper butterflies that are supposed to spray out of the trunk when the game is turned on. The game I purchased blows out about half of the butterflies and the rest just shuffle around inside the elephants trunk and will not come out at all. My four year old was so excited when she got this game but now she doesn't even play with it anymore because it frustrates her so much. For the price of the product and coming from a well known manufacturer such as Hasbro, I expected a little more satisfaction. I do not recommend this product!"
1,disappointing,"My kids (age 3 and 5) saw this advertised on TV and asked for it for Christmas, so we got it for them. It's a cute idea, and it might be fun - if it worked the way it's intended. The little butterflys simply do NOT blow up the trunk the way they should. There must be 3 dozen, and the directions indicate that they should all be out in about 2 minutes - after about 5 minutes, and only two butterflys, my kids got really frustrated and started crying. One would naturally suspect weak batteries, but I was using a brand new package of Energizers. I changed them anyway, just to be sure - no luck. I think the fan is underpowered, or else the butterflys are two heavy, trunk too long, etc. Basically a bad design that needed more testing before being released to market.Two thumbs downs."
3,Elefun...not that fun,The fan loses power fast and rarely blows hard enough to get the butterflies out of the trunk. We were constantly having to check to see why the butterflies weren't coming out.
4,replacement parts,"I do agree that this toy needs some improvements, but much of the issues can be resolved as stated in previous reviews by others. They actually do work, I've tested them.I've noticed that some were concerned that there are not enough butterflies. [...]In fact, [...] has replacement parts for most of the games listed on their website. So instead of trashing the toy that your child truely loves because of missing parts, check out the website."
3,The Idea Is Great BUT I Am Not Completely Sold,"I borrowed this toy from a friend and am undecided as to whether or not I will be purchasing it for my children. My 4, 2, and 1 year-old sons love this toy when you turn it on. Unfortunately, it takes longer to set the toy up than it does to play one round. We all know the patience level of most small children - very short.My kids like it and I would be more inclined to buy it if the following things were different:More Butterflies with better construction (not so cheap)Higher powered motor to propel the butterfliesHeavier duty netsPlug in adapter - the batteries do not last long.For $..., it fits the bill if you expect to have this toy not last very long."
1,Doesn't work!,My daughter was so excited to get this game and then we set it up(with 2 different brand new sets of batteries) and it won't blow the butterflies out. The fan is way too weak!
2,Not enough power to push butterflies out the trunk,Just bought this item today at Target. I bought 4 new batteries.There isn't enough power to push the butterflies out the trunk.My 4 year old is bored waiting for the butterflies to come out.I have read all the reviews and I have yet to cut off the plastictrunk (make it shorter) as I'm thinking about taking this toy backto the store. I shouldn't have to modify it to get it to work.Don't buy this toy. The concept is great. The fan that blowsthe butterflies just doesn't have enough power to make it worthwhile though.
1,My child was very disapointed,This was not much fun..... There was not enough air pressure to even hold the trunk up. It was over in about five seconds. I would not have paid for this. It was a gift from my mom in law.
2,No Butterflies,I gave this gift to my kids for there bithday.They were very happy to get it as we had seen it on tv many times.But when we turned it on the butterflies came out very slow one at a time two if we were lucky.there is not enough power blowing the butterflies out. My kids aged 4 and 6 were disapointed.And we used new batteries.This would be a great toy if the butterflies were faster Kids loose intrest to fast
1,Returned the next day..,"I bought this item as a birthday gift and game to play at my daughters 6th birthday party. It was a HUGE waste of money. Like previous reviewers pointed out, the fan barely keeps the trunk up, and after about 10 minutes of running the butterflies weren't even flying out anymore, instead just twirling around in the trunk. The 12 girls at her party got bored of this game very quickly and I returned it the next day.Jamie~Mom of 4"
1,Needs more Power,"My 2 year old daughter had a lot of fun with this game, but it seems like the motor isn't strong enough, it worked perfect for a couple days with brand name batteries but after that it wasn't strong enough to blow the ""butterflies"" out of the trunk."
3,Not as much fun as I would have thought,I purchased this item for my children for Christmas. They were both very excited about playing with it. The product works fine however the butterflies come out so fast that the fun is over in seconds. The head of the elephant is hard to remove so you must be there to assist your children with refilling the elephant and starting the game over and over and over again. Kids could play 50 times in 2 minutes which makes the novelty wear off quickly.
1,I thought butterfly fly!,"My daughter was very excited to get this toy. After the reading the first few review, it seemed like this would have been a fun toy to play. I should have kept on reading.It's a struggle for the butterfly to shoot up and out. After a 1/2 hour of playing we never got to finish the first and only gamed played. I didn't have a problem with the truck standing up straight, they just wouldn't fly. My 3 year old gave up imm. but the the 7 year old (who bought the toy) was very disappointed.This one is going back to the store."
3,"very short playtime, have to constantly refill","this game is pretty fun, good to have 4 nets for kids. I've had it a few years, it works still, but the nose is starting to tear at the seam. For the kids to keep interested, they really appreciate having someone there to keep refilling the elephant since the butterflies fly out in 10 seconds, game over."
2,"Good Idea, Poor Construction","This is a great idea for a toy but the construction is so poor that it creates more frustration than it promotes education. Naturally, the commercial shows the toy working properly but reality is that the motor is so weak (understandably so for safety reasons) the butterflies do not float easily out of the Elefun's trunk - there is a lot of shaking and moving around of the Elefun just to release the butterflies and then the butterflies come out all at once and the game is over. Unfortunately, we bought this toy when it first came out and payed the full $[...] for it - not worth it. You can still teach your kids colors with the butterflies and those who are creative and can think up other games to play with the components."
2,Fun for the first five minutes!,Great concept but the game eats batteries faster than our dog eats steak! Would be really awesome if it had a more powerful motor.
4,Read The Book Before The Movie,"It's no surprise this book was optioned for a feature just as it was being published. It has all the elements for a great starring action vehicle for someone like Jake Gyllenhaal. A young documentary filmmaker has a great career unfolding, and just met the girl of his dreams. However, everything changes in an instant when he gets a phone call from his Mother telling him to get to her house immediately. When he arrives, she's been murdered, and suddenly his life veers wildly out of control with everything and everyone he thought he knew not being quite who, or what they were.The book is a fun ride and it's success lies in the 'everyman' premise that fuels it. As long as you're willing to suspend your disbelief a bit, you'll enjoy it."
3,Slow and somewhat silly,"I love a good spy novel but have to admit I found this ""thriller"" to be slow, and very hard to get through. I also found the plot to be a bit hard to swallow - yeah, a 20-something nerd suddenly becomes a hardened CIA-type, narrowly escaping death a number of times in the most ridiculous and unbelievable circumstances. If you want a great CIA read, try ""The Company"" by James Littell...much more exciting, longer, and more sophistocated."
3,"Good, not great...","Okay, there's a lot going on in this book, some of it a bit too confusing. There are also a few too many characters who show up and then get killed and leave you wondering why they were there to begin with. I agree with the reviewers who write that this book reads like a move script. It's as if the author wrote it this way because he wants desperately for it to be made into a move.Having said that, I still got a kick out of reading it. It's a fun, fast-paced read. Not a great book, but not bad either. A good one to read on a lazy summer afternoon..."
2,Puppy Book,"the pages in the book are shiny and too hard to write on - takes too long for the ink to dry. Also, should have more areas where one could write more comments on the dog's ""happenings"" and not be categorized."
4,Pretty good,"This lighter would be better if it was real, or if it actually weighed something. People pick it up and they know its fake right away because its so light. It is easy to get someone when they ask for a light, but impossible if your just trying to get them to light your lighter. From what I hear it gives a way better shock than the shocking phone, I'm too scared to try it."
5,Superb classic!,"High quality DVDs made from the original program material. A classic show I enjoyed then, and enjoy now."
2,Got blisters too!,"I wore these two days ago and my thigh still has a red ring of blister on it! It's due to the friction of the inner silicone on the lace. It hurt so bad when I took off the thigh high at the end of the day, and I realized why, I had a red line around the front of my leg that had blistered. I hope it goes away, soon. It's too bad because they do look very pretyy on."
1,Caused sores on my legs,"I am still dealing with the sores/burns on my legs after 2 weeks of not wearing them the Berkshire thigh highs. The rubber behind the lace top that adheres to your skin is, in my opinion, toxic. I have been wearing thigh highs for a very long time and when I went to re-order, the brand I usually get -Jockey was discontinued or out of stock. So I know that the sores from the Berkshire thigh highs were not caused because I was new to wearing thigh-highs. Stay away from this brand."
1,the apotheosis of plug and pray,"I'm quite curious where in the manufacturer's website I can find the updated XP drivers, as the previous reviewer has pointed out. After struggling for 2 hours to get this device to work with both a Motorola V505 and my friend's Sony Ericson Twhateveritis, I nearly wanted to break it. After installing the drivers that came on the CD, the thing is able to recognize both Bluetooth devices, but that's pretty much where it ends. I could not get any data transfer or further communication. I went to the manufacturer's website and there are no drivers to be downloaded. If there's a way around this, please post it. Otherwise it's going to be another lesson relearned: you get what you pay for-- if you buy it cheap, you're going to have to buy it again."
1,Buy something (anything) else.,"This device never worked properly. When I checked for a software upgrade, the manufacturers web site stated that the security settings had been tampered with and prevented me from downloading an upgrade. Besides the fact that the circuit board was enclosed so as to block the LED indicator, I think this is repackaged garbage."
5,Wheels Of Terror,"If you enjoy reading war adventure books and you like books that put you right in the middle of the horror and bloodshed, this one is for you.On the back cover there is a warning in red lettering,""This is a book of horrors, and should be left alone by those prone to nightmares.Sven Hassel's descriptions of the atrocities committed by both sides are the most horrible indictments of war I have ever read---Alan Sillitoe--This book and others by Sven Hassel are true gems that take the reader to a place and time that is horrifying. You feel the fear,and understand the terrors of war as if it is really happening. These books are a true window into the world of the WW2 Russian front at its worst. A definate must read for all war novel enthusiasts who enjoy reading what it was truely like on the Russian front. Non stop action from page 1 through to the end. These books are my all time favorites and I'm sure they will become one of your favorites as well."
4,The science of mundane,"This is a very good book to have for an engineer who deal with two-phase flows and heat transfer, for those who design and operate nuclear reactors, thermal power plants and other thermal management systems. It provides a foundation, with an extensive collection of empirical formulae which could be useful if properly applied. What feels missing in this book, - and is general feature of BOOKS on two-phase flows and boiling - is the heavy empiricism, the lack of a scientific concept, the absence of robust theoretical treatment that one should possess after reading such a comprehensive compilation. That is to say, it is good for some one who knows the subject/field, not for teaching someone about boiling heat transfer and two-phase flows."
1,"neat technology, horrible squirt gun","I got one of these after reading about how it creates a ""ball"" of water to fling out.Overall its neat that it can create the ball of water, but the range is horrible (if lucky you get 10 feet), it does not aim well, and leaks alot.Overall, for the money I would buy several cheap squirt guns at the dollar store, or a super soaker over this."
2,Weak!,Nice concept. Fun for about the 2 seconds it takes to realize you can't get away from someone you just 'balled' at maximum range 'cause they are standing 3 steps away from you.
1,it blows,don't get this thing it really blows it leaks alot and it does not go very far at the max it might go about 9-12 feet. if you are looking for a good water gun get one of the max distance ones. belive me this is a waste of your money
1,Poor performing and leaky,"I usually am skeptical of other people's reviews, but in this case, any negative review for this product is absolutely true. After seeing the ""ball"" fly through the air, the gun became more of a joke than the amazing invention Maxim magazine said it was. The gun leaks more than it shoots (honestly), and the balls are too small to be called balls. Save your money and buy some water balloons or use the hose."
5,It's very emotive chapter. Great,"When i've see this chapter and i've see the station crash, one feeling of empty was invaded to me. It's the best chapter of Babylon."
1,the mother of all cop outs,"Anybody buying this video expecting to find out what happened in the events shown in War without end is going to be disappointed. Other than knowing they survive we are told nothing. That JMS didn't complete his own story in the five series is disappointing, but to not even make the effort is really annoying.Sheridan was given a twenty year extension on his life apparently for no better reason than to die of old age.What we have here is an epilogue to unseen events. AS far as that goe, it's OK, but as a conclusion ... well it isin't one"
2,Not the quality I'm used to from Safari,"I've purchased numerous Safari flea combs in the past - I found them to be a quality product whose teeth combed through any dog's hair.But this comb is a disappointment = there's no space between a number of the teeth, meaning that section of the comb is as ineffective as a comb with missing teeth. If I'm not picking up loose hair, it's a sure bet the comb is skipping over fleas."
5,Fantastic!,"If you thought the first two journals were outstanding wait until you read this one! Just by reading the little preview at the end of Wolf Star made me anxious to get a hold of this book! The beginning chapter got me on my toes until the last few pages. I was in suspense almost the whole time! Ypu find out about Claidi's family, her love, and some extradinary people. To me, this was Lee's best work!If you are the romantic kind (I am) you would adore this book! Claidi's one and only love (Argul) is back in action (won't say what happens)! If you love how Claidi describes the places she goes, this book is ideal for you! Almsot every reader type would love this book! I almost want to reread it again. I can't wait to get started on Wolf Wing!However, if you haven't read the first two journals don't read this one, you won't have a clue about anything! If you like, read my reviews on Wolf Tower (the first one) and Wolf Star (the second one)! Enjoy reading!"
5,Incredible!,"This book was amazing! It has so many more elements in it than the other two books. Also, you'll get every question answered that you ever asked in the other two books. If you loved the Harry Potter series, you'll like this just as much. But remember not to read this untill after you've finished the other two.Other Books to read: Bolth Sides of Time, Harry Potter, Ella Enchanted, Chronicles of Narnia, Lord of the Rings, The Giver, The Arkadians, and Cathern, Called Birdy."
1,A Huge Put Down,"When I was about 11 I read Wolf Tower, and I have to say it was and still is one of my favorites. I awaited the next one to come out for something like a year. Finally that came out, and I bought it, read it, and it was great!!! I remember after that I checked on the internet for the third one coming out because the second leaves you hanging in the air. The day Wolf Queen came out I went and bought it. This book definitly gives a bad name to the other books. Everything basically turns out to be a lie except for Argul. I really hate this book and wish I did not read it to give up everything that it had in the other books, seriously do not waste your money on this book! I will tell you she gets back to Argul... it is basically all you need to know."
4,"This is good, and there's more!","The people who have read this may find that though it was enjoyable, it wasn't entirely satisfying. This is because this is not the end of the series. There is one more book called ""Wolf Wing"" which has already been released in the UK. It sees a return of previous characters like Venn. Go to Amazon.co.uk to see about the concluding book."
2,Board is a pain,"The board for this game is a pain...half the time the tiles that cover the letters stick. It takes forever and a day to look in the book, locate the letters' locations, and uncover them too. I love Wheel of Fortune, but you're better off playing a computerized version where you don't have all the hassle."
3,Gish-era rawk,"Apart from ""Rhinoceros"" which was stolen from ""Gish,"" the Lull E.P. also features three previously unreleased tracks: ""Slunk,"" which rocks with an intensity unmatched; ""Blue,"" later to appear on the b-sides collection ""Pisces Iscariot""; and ""Bye June,"" a solo acoustic piece. Also of interest is the artwork - some lyrics from ""Obscured,"" which was not released until the ""Today"" single several years later, appear on the insert."
4,Clear and concise clock-makers guide,"As a former student of ""Skip"" Kadar I was delighted to see this book was published. I utilized a few techniques demonstrated when I crafted a Grandfather clock from scratch using my own design drawn from examples in this book. I have also crafted several smaller mantel-style clocks also using the book as a rough guide."
2,Ekkkk....love ya Ru but......,Love you Ru and so that's why I got this movie but Eeeek I would not recommend this one to anyone...however I can see how people might like it...My other half did to a degree but thats because of the porn stars in it.
2,Ru 's great but..,I bought this DVD because I like Ru Pauls music and video's.The movie was shot in a poor quality and the story isn't great .But who cares Ru Paul looks phantastic .You go girl !!!Stef
2,historical fantasy,"IF (?) anybody is interested, this is a novel.The so-called ""Journal"" is overladen with fiction writer gimmicks (eg. color of the wallpaper!)IF it had been ""true"" it would more likely have been written as a DIARY.HOWEVER, it is mildly entertaining....(no spoiler here, but the social mores of Europe in 1936 could hardly have supported the final journalistic conceit!!)"
1,"Boring and Same Old, Same Old","I received this book for free, and I'm glad I didn't pay anything for it. It was boring and predictable. Very drawn out. This is the first book I've read by Kristin Hannah. I surely hope her others are better and deeper than this one. Very disappointing."
5,Summer Island,"Wonderful book, I have read all her books and this one is one of her top picks for me. Many bends and turns and questions solved through out the book. A Mom and her two enstranged daughters, each with her own story come together to find the real truth. Then there are the 2 brothers with stories of their own intertwined with the moms.Loved it !!"
2,Disappointing,"Although I liked the subject matter, the story of a troubled mother-daughter relationship, I found the story a little too drawn out, full of clichés, sappy at times & too predictable. The mother character is not sufficiently realistic to be convincing. I have read Hannah's other novel, ""On Mystic Lake"", which was the best fiction I had read in years - so I was disappointed with ""Summer Island""."
2,Eh...,"This was a fast read, but not a great one. This is definitely my least favorite book of hers. Her writing makes me think she belongs in inspirational fiction with the way she slips God in, but at the same time, I don't quite understand how she ended up in literary fiction. I think this book really suffered from the lack of a plot and some REALLY stupid phrases (""pit-bull-mean""?!)... I mean come on, bad enough the first time she used it, but twice in one book in reference to different people, from two different P.O.V.s... not to mention it is an uneducated, stupid remark that really bothered me, especially when she is considered to be such a ""sensitive"" writer."
3,Satisfying summer read,"The central story concerns a mother estranged from her daughters, the painful journeys they all have taken, and the emergence of courage enough to begin the healing process. There are secondary stories, some quite powerful, and issues of prejudice, Hollywood facades, parenting failures, as well as a young man dying of cancer, also estranged from his familiy. Set in the San Juan islands, the book celebrates the beauty there, and depends on the vagaries of island transportation to move some of the story along. One of the daughters exemplifies the damage done by her mother's abandonment, as well as the strength of character developed through years of shaky independent living. See the discussion of some similar family issues inLetters to My Granddaughters; Insights and inspiration for a life journey."
1,This is the worst Bible Story Book I've ever read.,"I would not recommend this book to anybody.I found the stories to be much too in depth for a small child with a vivid imagination - especially the story about ""Abraham and His Family."" The wording is not complicated, but I thought that the stories were a little over exaggerated in some areas and a little to explicit for a three year old.The illustrations are beautiful, but do not compensate for the poor storytelling. I feel that there are much better products out there such as the Alice in Bibleland series."
2,Isolated incident.,"I had a horrible experience with the skywalker trampoline. We had it for about two weeks. From march 24th when we set it up, until April 5th. If you live in a windy area, for the love of your trampoline, stake it down. Ours was lifted and turned into a giant sail and landed on our neighbor's car. No damage to the car, THANK GOD. It landed with the enclosure on the bottom, so the padded bars cushioned the impact. We brought it back and never bothered with it again. The kids were devastated because they had such a great time. This is an isolated incident, if I lived on property with less wind-vortex monstrosities coming through, I'd get another one. It was just a really upsetting experience. Oh, the 'T' bar that is oh-so-strong broke right in two. The bars aren't any stronger than anything else that's made of aluminum. It was a mangled mess!"
5,trampoline,"we have had this for two years now. to this day the kids LOVE jumping around on this. I thought my older daughter would get bored but her and friends use it as much as always. great quality, was easy for me to assemble and it has held about a dozen jumping kids at once. Also, it has lasted by the ocean with no signs of rust and the nets show no signs of tearing so I would say this is definitely an excellent trampoline."
1,Bad movie,I watched this movie because Courtney Henggler (Sheldon's twin sister on Big Bang Theory) is in it.Probably doesn't tell anybody that she was in it...bad movie!
3,It was OK,"The game wasnt bad. It was very challenging the 1st time I played it, it took me over an hour to get Ginger's present. I also got kicked out of the academy at the very end. The game was definutly fun to play, the only problem was the graphics, which were terrible. Here's a hint- When you go to a new place(or new week), always go to the library first, then do dressage, showjumping, cross country. You get moral points from doing dressage. Always start your day of with something to help their moral! Anyway, if you are looking for a real quality horse game, I suggest Equestriad!"
4,got to get it!,I played this game with my sister and WE loved it. The riddles and sneaking and all that stuff was fun. I agree the controls are hard but the graphics are amazing and the places are aswome! And competing is so much fun.You have to get up to 9 out of ten each week to compete in shows. I recomend this game for everyone!
1,Terrible Game,Graphics were horrible and story line was boring to the point that you cannot even focus to play the rest of the game. Buy if you don't care about graphics but I do not suggest this game to anyone who cares about realism. I could not even finish the first day of the game because the graphics where so terrible. Do not waste your money buy a better game.
1,Hated it!,"The game is too confusing. It was too hard to control the character around the castle. The cover isn't anything like the game - the cover looks fun but the game is too serious and boring. When you're done playing, theres no way to quit without killing the program. It was so bad I had to take it back."
5,Excellent game; well made,"This is an excellent game that I can play for hours on end. Once you think that you can just train your horse and play around, something happens that is totally unexpected. I got this for Christmas 2005 and I still enjoy playing it unlike some of the other games.I would choose this one over Horsez any day because this one is a little more realistic and it's more fun (I think!)"
4,i need help!!!!!!,I need help on this game . I'm stuck when you have to get ginger's birthday prestent for this guy.can any one help me???????
3,not quite exemplary,"Probably an eternal embarassment to messrs Coleman and Walker, this sketchbook of what could have been demands some added imagination from the listener. Many quality songs are here: ""Stay One Jump Ahead"" or the cynically poignant rant ""America"", but the vision is certainly limited by a hasty (?) release. Coleman's shift toward the mystic is realized beautifully on ""Tiahuanaco"" yet his fierce vision is best realized with a dense backdrop, not all this keyboard twaddling, some of which I'm sure was never meant to serve as more than an artist's sketch of a complete work, which this album is not. Word has it that this album was slapped together by some suits at the label and released as an official KJ release, instead of a Jaz Coleman solo album, which would explain a lot. The lucidity is there without the savagery, which may or may not work for you. It does for me after a few listenings."
4,COC the real COC!,"With some guy named Eric Eycke on ""vocals"" this crossover punk/metal effort comes close to masterpiece status. The songs are as fast as they are short. Reed Mullin was/is one of the best drummers out there, and Woody Weatherman does his best Sabbath on speed rendition, not to mention Mike Dean the little monster on bass....I loved it in 84, its still better than 95% of the [junk] the corporate gods pass off as hardcore today!"
2,Too punk,Too punk for my taste. Just like the other early COC albuns this sounds like punk instead of metal.
5,Helps to have the toys first,"My son likes to play with Weebles, so I bought him this DVD. He loves it and I sorta like it too (I'm not a big fan of kid's TV). I LOVE that I can put it on and he will sit quietly through it while I do house work, home accounting, or catching up on my email."
4,jeopardy,"The board is too small so the contestents have a hard time reading the ""answers"" so they can formulate their ""questions"". The MC has to turn the board toward himself/herself so he/she can see the ""answer"" and then turn it around so everyone can see what the MC just read."
3,Blue plastic,"Blue plastic and small print make it really difficult to read. otherwise, questions are pretty good. we had fun and hope friends will want to play it again. Susan and Steve, Goodyear, AZ"
3,Burgess is not the best,"To my mind, Burgess is one of the least interesting commentators on Joyce. (Don't get me started on what a poor linguist he is--""Mouthful of Air,"" for example, is terrible.) He rarely gets beyond the obvious, at least not without getting it wrong. Rather than spending time reading Burgess, I would recommend that those interested in understanding Joyce turn instead to Richard Ellmann, Hugh Kenner, and Stuart Gilbert--all of whom are superior critics."
3,Highland 11562 Surelok Tie Down with Hooks,"Belts are extremely sturdy and work well, but hooks are shallow and we worried that they would slip off. Luckily, they didn't!"
5,Wonderful,"One of the best movies I have ever seen in years. I particularly like the way they confront the traditional value of education which is pretty much the same in Asia. It is also a very entertaining movie. Although it is almost 3-hour long, you just don't feel it. Great movie! highly recommended."
5,Don't go by the title!,"I watched this movie only after being forced to do it. The title never seemed interesting enough. But after watching it once, I became a huge fan of it. The story is much deeper and meaningful than the title. Great experience with the buyer; the DVD was received new and much earlier than the date promised."
5,3 Idiots,"A very entertaining movie highlighting the deep bond between three friends. Light-hearted throughout, yet able to deliver a clear message for young people as they enter their college years. Fantastic scenery in the end making this a very enjoyable and rather 'short' three hour movie."
3,Mo was Pretty Good,Monique was way better than I thought she was gonna be after seeing her previously in other things. Overall it was an Ok standup cast. Since Volume 3 was soooo Wack it made this was one seem a lot more funnier than it probably was. LOL
3,Not what I expected,"I'm a huge Doris Day Fan. I was very excited to find this CD. However, it's my own fault for not reading the description closely enough. If you are a fan of the On Moonlight Bay/By the Light of the Silvery Moon movies, you will be disappointed to learn that the male portions of the songs are NOT performed by Gordon MacRae. Lyrics are different than in the movies - it was just not very enjoyable. Doris' performances, as always, a pleasure - but vocals by Gordon MacRae would have made this a top-notch ""must have""."
5,Gentle courage,"I am reading this book for the second time now; it's the kind of book that, as soon as finished, you want to read again. With mild, yet totally unambiguous clarity Pema Chodron reveals that without exception we are all imperfect and afraid to acknowledge it. But that's not all: tapping from ancient Buddhist sources (Atisha's slogans), the author manages to put me right on the track of compassion in action as the way out. Compassion with myself as a starting point for growing compassion for others. And it works! Maybe not as fast as I would like, but that's what you get with imperfect people... :)I wholeheartedly recommend this book for anyone who has a hard time facing the painful facts of life. Not only does it help you face them, but also it teaches you how to deal with them - a gift for the heart!"
3,Thought it would be Pema's voice,"I was looking forward to this and when I popped it in my CD player and heard the woman from Sounds True, I was disappointed (no offense to her, I just get so much from Pema's voice and spirit)."
5,Perhaps the most mature approach to spiritual awakening.,"When Things Fall Apart: Heart Advice for Difficult Times (Shambhala Classics)For people who are looking for a practice guide that will help them understand the process of observation with rigorous acceptance, integrity and compassion of all that which is observed. This is about finding peace through that process because the heart opens as a result. The opening and openness of the heart are at the core of that peace which we seek. Our incessant wanting is only satiated by an open heart. It represents a mature emotional and spiritual approach in understanding what we want and how we gain peace. Perhaps a truly fully open heart receives (perhaps even attracts?) what it wants because it cherishes what is."
5,Great for kids!,"My 12 year old, science-minded son and I love this show. It's a great introduction to applying science, math and technology to real-world problems in innovative ways. It teaches creative problem solving and the reality that not all innovative ideas work. We wish there were more."
4,"Not as ""Bleak"" as I Expected!","""Bleak House"" was written to expose problems with the Chancery court, many of which still exist in some forms. Dickens particularly focuses on how long it took the courts to decide cases, and the effect of such cases on the parties involved. Now, this sounds like it would be rough reading, but Charles Dickens is a master at making an otherwise depressing and ""bleak"" subject entertaining. After a few chapters it is practically impossible to put the book down, and the surprise ending makes it worth the long wait. If you enjoyed ""David Copperfield"" or ""Great Expectations"", you will definitely love ""Bleak House""."
5,Dickens Best and Hardest,"This is Dickens best novel, the satire is very funny and the Characters are all very interesting. He occasionaly falls into his normal trap of treating women as shallow air heads . Besides being the best novel of all-time it is also the hardest. I normally brezze through Dickens but it took me at least 4 tries to get through the first chapt. You should definintly not read this if you have never read Dickens before. <P>And anyone who doesn't cry when Jo dies does not have a soul"
4,Bleak House,Couldn't Put it down! Typical Dickens - wonderfully rich and developed characters from many different levels of the Victorian class structure. It was fun following them through the paths their lives took. His observations of his society are sharp but the people he developes are warm and stick close for a long time.
1,Kindle Version Illegible,"I will have to get a different version of this book because the Kindle version is impossible to read. Words don't make sense, are run together, etc."
1,Yawning in North Carolina,"I have read Great Expectations and David Copperfield and enjoyed them immensely. These books offer a wonderful, colorful cast of characters. So, I thought I would try Bleak House. I slogged through 150 pages and finally gave up! Tedious is the operative word here! The characters were dessicated and one-dimensional and I felt as if the plot was not moving forward at all. Overall, a major disappointment."
1,"""Bleak House"" book review (byAJ from OLSOS)","This novel begins in London during the 1800's. The narrator has appeared in court to discuss the famous case known as ""Jarndyce and Jarndyce."" The Lord Chancellor (the judge) tells the narrator to appear at an orphanage to talk to the owner. She appears at the orphanage only to meet the nicest group of children, and a very kind and loving woman named Miss Caddy Jellyby. The Lord Chancellor assigns the narrator to meet Miss Jellyby because they both have one thing in common, they love Africa.They both love the culture. After the narrators stay at Miss Jellyby's place, she is given a letter with some very horrible,tragic information. This book was one of the worst books I have ever read. I drooled with boredom as I struggled to read each page. There are copious amounts of characters, and too many details to comprehend. These details tend to get you very confused very easily. I was frustrated by the end of Chapter 1. I do not recommend this book."
5,"Wonderful story, great characters.","Charles Dickens at his best. Complex story but within the mix of characters comes the triumph of tender, compassionate good people."
1,Awful formatting,"I can't comment on Dicken's, but this particular version for the Kindle is unreadable on account of typo after typo."
4,B Complex in gel cap form,I bought this along with Vit C in gel cap form because a doctor explained on his website that he tests the blood of his patients regularly for the levels of various supplements he recommends and he claimed that pills seemed to result in extremely poor and uneven levels in the body. He also claimed gel caps were much better compared to pills in terms of a more even and reliable absorption into the blood stream.
5,This is a great pair of shoes!,I love these shoes! They are very flexible which is a must for toddler feet and they are SO easy to put on.. which is a bonus for parents! And oh how cute they are! We have any problems with quality.. they are holding up great! Highly recommend!
4,Affordable!,"This is by far the most affordable way of buying this product for your pets. It is a huge quantity that will last for many years. I bought it a couple of years ago and we use it with our 3 cats. It seems to work well, it is what a vet recommended to us, but much more affordable than what the vet could sell to us. I was unable to find it over the counter in most stores, so I was glad to find it here. My only complaint is that I had to do a bit of research online to find out how to dose it properly based on the size of my cats. Wish there were detailed instructions that came with the product."
5,let's dig deeper,If ya like Tab 25 Check out Well Water Conspercy It's with John Paul Mcbain and outher Seattle music folks I think ya will dig it
3,A fair bridge,"Before I purchased this product, I was aware of the problems with WPA and the latest firmware that corrected the issues. Still, after installing the latest firmware, I had IP conflicts. Some resets later, it worked, but not with WEP or WPA. I checked the firmware version to make sure I had installed the correct firmware. It checked out ok, so I reinstalled the firmware. Two resets later, it worked with WEP and WPA TKIP. WPA AES is not supported. I did not check if WPA Radius worked. My AP is using WPA2. I cannot recreate the problem I experienced. Maybe it was just a glitch. This unit runs very warm so make sure you place it away from other heat sources. A small fan may not be a bad idea for any electronic device. I have an Xbox and two computers connected without any problems.I have not tested the switch, as far as features and speed is concerned. As long as the ports function, I am happy. If you need a manged switch, this might be more important to you than I"
4,"Packs a serious, in-depth punch on CW medicine!","Informative. A pleasure to read. Rutkow is a genius though. His beautiful book, SURGERY, AN ILLUSTRATED HISTORY, is still his masterpiece and will always be a prize on my bookshelf. Other reviewers have already gone into great detail on the contents of this volume, so I will just say that if you are interested in some little-known facts, stats, and extreme in-depth coverage of medicine during the Civil War, this is the best place to start. You WILL find plenty here that is new and fascinating."
3,Don't buy this book if you want to learn sushi preparation.,"This is a decent book concerning sushi. There are better ones out there. I found it fairly interesting - especially information on fish markets in Japan. In general however I wasn't sure what the author's objective was? If his objective was teaching sushi preparation - he failed in my opinion. If you want a good, affordable book for basic sushi preparation, buy Nobuko Tsuda's ""Sushi Made Easy"""
4,Childhood memories,This is and will always be a great movie. Purchased for my sister as a gift to bring back old childhood memories.
5,The most innovative rock guitarist.... up there with Jimi!,"A high profile rock star, who is a mean guitarist himself once said the following about Jeff Beck:""Jimi passed on, Clapton sold out and Jimmy Page burned out. That leaves Jeff Beck.... consistently the most innovative and creative guitar genius of our times""How true! Jeff Beck is the Guitarist equivalent of Bob Dylan. A century from now when the Les Claypools and the Wes Borlands are relegated to footnotes in the History of the Rock Guitar, Jeff Beck will stand out as one of the greatest guitarists of Rock Music.His latest album ""Who Else"" is an astonishing record with a heady mix of influences and very modern. Every song is a gem.... no fillers and no muzak sh*t.If you wanna listen to cutting edge guitar music delivered by one of the masters of the instrument.... look no further! After all ""Who Else"" can deliver such a great record????"
2,Great Chops! Forgettable Tunes!!,"If only Jeff Beck could learn to identify the proper songs to highlight his incredible guitar chops. If your looking for another THERE & BACK or BLOW BY BLOW effort, you can forget it. Jeff Beck would do well to surround himself with a standard jazz/fusion quartet to help bring out the subtelty of his brilliant style. He is to busy trying to burn rubber on his latest effort, but there is very little emotion and soul searching on WHO ELSE?? Love Ya Jeff, but this disc is going into cold storage after only several listens....."
4,still an outstanding guitar player,"while there are some techno styles on this cd, Jeff Beck still plays as good as ever and retains his excellent style of playing. The first two tracks are somewhat a stepdown for the legendary guitarist but nonetheless an improvement of the electronic style. The third is a breat lamentful blues track that sound as though it were recorded live. space for the papa is also very good. Thx138 could very do without the electornics. Jeff beck obviously has been expermenting with the techno sound. he even said so in guitar player. Although i find this be be a setback for beck he still has lost none of his great guitar skill which shows here even at the duller moments. sOme of the material still recall his blow by blow and wired period with a new texture. While jeff beck can take away some of the elements of greatness greatness can never be taken away from Jeff Beck. Buy this, whtever flaws it has it is light years above most of the material that is pushed on us today."
3,Some Good Noodling,"Jeff Beck is a very accomplished guitar player. In spite of all the mdoern touches specifically the techno beats, Jeff's guitar remains front and center. There are some very creative touches on this release most notably Declan, Another Place, Space For The Papa, and Brush With The Blues. Jeff always seems to vary his tone which always makes his material a fresh listen.However, with all the breath taking guitar solos, many of the songs just meander a bit too much. Coupled with the lack of a consistent presence of a keyboard or additional melody instrument, the routine gets a little stale even with all of Jeff's tone colorings. Its funny how this recording hypes a reunion between keyboardist Tony Hymas and Beck. However, Hymas's touches are few and far between. The drumming and bass work is pretty good although the techno beats are a bit nerve racking at times.A good effort yes, but Who Else is indeed a far cry from Blow By Blow."
3,Nunn Bush Oxfords,"Purchased these shoes for work-on my feet alot. Wish I didn't get the wide width. There a little big though comfortable with an inner sole. Quality of the ""leather"" could be a little better . Overall there O.K.- get what you pay for."
4,Astonishing,"I was afraid it might be a little weird and slow film, but it happened to be a really interesting film full of beauty and mixed feelings about human being.Great movie."
5,great dvd extras,"What the current Amazon listing does not explicitly mention is the wealth of DVD EXTRAS that accompany the 100 minute feature in this 2-DVD set.ABOVE THE ICEBELOW THE ICESEALS & MENDIVE LOCKER INTERVIEWSOUTH POLE EXORCISMJONATHAN DEMME INTERVIEWS WERNER HERZOG+ a hidden ""Easter Egg"" extra: SEAL MEN, an Antarctic Parody of Herzog's GRIZZLY MAN, with weddell seals replacing grizzly bearsall and all this is over 3 hours of EXTRAS!"
2,Not as practical as I thought.,"My rating is based on what I thought I was getting, based on the other reviews here.What I am looking for is a book with that consistently (and constantly) bridges control theory discussions with physical examples.For the most part this book is still written in an academia style, this book is not much different than my college control book. It is a little lighter litarally and figuratively; bit there are still a lot of equations and suggested computer simulations with limited real world explanation."
5,Order by the case!,"After having a painful conversation with my elderly mother-in-law about the fact that some changes would have to be made if she wanted to continue to live at home, I saw this book. I bought it and then told my sister-in-law (her daughter) about it. She said, ""Did you get it for me or John or Michael?"" I should have bought a case of them. It applies to everyone at some time."
3,some really good others hardly worth watching,"i am a gothic belly dancer so i'm always looking for new videos to watch and study. while several of the dances in this video are really awesome to watch, probably 2/3 of it i didnt finish watching because it was so boring. they think that by wearing gothic clothes or just ""black"" they can say they're gothic belly dancers but a few of these women are super boring, have no spirit and just look like regular cabaret belly dancers wearing red. for the ones that are good though they're worth watching. i'd try to youtube the dancers first because i'm not sure it's worth the $ to buy."
1,Very disappointing.,I was hoping for instruction of some variety. The very beginning is like some strange wannabe orgy... and the dances that happen after that aren't anything like I would expect from a published work. I am very disappointed in this. 23 dances? Only 2 I might watch again. Total let down.
3,Good price,"Great price, decent product, but was really dirty and has a small crack in one letter. But over all happy with product. Would buy from again."
4,Great seller,Really appreciated this seller and his willingness to go above and beyond when I had some installation challenges with my new Mac . Great!
4,Fancy Backpack,This bag was great! Easy to adjust and travel with. I found it simple to keep all my belongings easily organized. I would advise anyone geeting this bag to play around with it before travelling to get used to everything it does instead of discovering features during travel ;)
3,Bring me the head of (producer) Ric Ocasek,"Any Bad Brains disc is gonna have intrinsic value, but why buy this when you can grab the Roir Sessions (s/t)? The songs are 50-70% common, and they don't have the Cars-y veneer that undercuts Rock for Light."
2,Fast & Furious,"Everyone who stated that this mixer has no low speed is correct. The lowest setting is the equivalent of medium-to-high on other mixers, so you can't use it for initial blending of ingredients or anything too liquidy or powdery without it spraying everywhere! It does a good job of mixing thicker ingredients (cookie dough, etc.) but if you need to start low and gradually increase speed (like a cake mix) this does not work well.This is an inexpensive mixer and if you just want something to use once in a while it may be okay for you. If you are looking to get a hand mixer as a gift for someone, I do NOT recommend it. This one does not perform as it should."
1,Where's the drywall screw attachment?,"As everyone else has said, the speed settings on this thing are ridiculous. You have five versions of ""too fast"" with a boost button to make things even worse. Black and Decker includes this alleged bowl scraper attachment, which they say is suppose to conveniently scrape the sides of the bowl while you mix. Closer to the truth is the flexible attachment that snaps onto the beaters helps to minimize food flying out of the bowl due to the overkill speeds. But it doesn't help enough. It's too fast and you lose control of the mixing process because of that.This mixer sort of looks like a modified Kitchen Aid hand mixer. Believe me, it isn't. Don't waste your money on this one. You would think they took some leftover power drill works and modified them into a hand mixer."
3,"Good, but not as intended","The real strength of this book is its profuse illustration. Every flower is shown in a good-sized photo, and there are hundreds of them. That makes the book useful as a visual reference for someone drawing or painting, giving plenty of color and variety.As a gardening guide, though, I'm not sure how successful it is. The descriptions of each plant and its culture are very brief, possibly too brief to ensure good understanding of the plant and its needs."
2,very difficult to use,The left and right click buttons are very difficult to operate. The mouse only works within a foot or so from the laptop.
1,Do NOT waste your money,"Not at all what I expected. This just does not meet my expectations. I was there at the live experience, maybe that makes the difference. This was not at all up to par for what it was to represent. I would not recommend buying it to anyone."
3,Pass...,"Thin padding makes for a nightmare after just a half an hour of wearing, and they never feel like they're on right. Sound-wise... well, they're okay. I've heard much better for the same price (or lower). Bass isn't really there, but mids are certainly prevalent. The Form 2's do separate individual sounds, however."
