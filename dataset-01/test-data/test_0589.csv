4,y2j,"best jericho ever! the only problems are that his hair is tied back,his beard is too big,and his pants dont say ""Y2J"" on the back. buy it"
3,limited use,I was looking forward to easy tweezing but it really only works on my chin. Too much pain for the lip and doesn't really work on legs.
2,REAL white chocolate? I don't think so.,"The item descriptions states that this is real white chocolate. At $8.50 a pound, I was thinking this might be a better quality chocolate than the chips you buy at the grocery store. However, chocolate and cocoa butter are not listed on the bag. It does state ""artificial flavor added."" Cocoa butter is brown, so I guess it would stand to reason that there is no such thing as white chocolate. These discs are good. There is no denying that. But they are not any better than Nestle white chocolate chips at half the price. Save your money."
2,Disappointed,Difficult to assemble due to short screws and warped wood pieces. I was quite disappointed considering how much the stable costs. I would not buy this product again.
5,Expensive but worth the extra,"Bought this for my 5-year old who is a horse fanatic.It's been an absolute hit!! She plays with it everyday. We bought some horses from the farm stores, like Rural King and they fit perfect.We are pleased we paid the extra as we were concerned the cheaper ones would be on the small size. This is very well made, good quality and not too big or small :-)Highly recommend. Quick shipping with Amazon Prime and very well packaged to protect it during transit."
3,Not as they appear,"I was looking for a clean, modern looking high ball glass. When these arrived, the base of the glass is not flat, but appears to have ""feet."" This is not at all what I was expecting."
5,It's realy not about the money!!!!,This Book will make you think diferrently.It truely shows you the process of making a success in real estate or any other business is not as difficult as you would think. The secrets in this book are the foundation of a successful business. Enjoy and Grow.
3,Kindle Book,"The book was good, but I would not get the Kindle version because it has some charts in that are pictures and I could not figure out how to make them bigger and could not read them."
4,on the right track,Im considering a career in real estate. So I wanted some insight on this lucrative field. This book definitely satisfied my thirst. Its very informative. It focuses on developing great salesman habits.
3,Not totally worthless,"2.5 stars. First off, this book is directed at someone who runs a real estate business, not someone looking to start out in real estate. There were a few glimmers of insight but not much else. If you can pick up a copy for a dollar or two, it's worth looking through, but don't pay more than that.Not recomended."
1,snoooooooor,"glad i got it a half price, but i still wasted my money. If the Keller is anything to do with Keller Williams, well, that explains it. I guess it will come in handy if i need something to help me fall asleep."
1,Give Me A Break,"I am seriously doubting the review process of this site. There is no way this book could have received so many 5 Star ratings unless Keller's family has clogged the entire system with bloated comments. There is not one objective review in the whole lot, except for the man who gave it one star and pronounced it as junk--ditto. If someone could tell me what is so enlightening about this book, I would be grateful since I think I wasted money that could have been more wisely spent. My impression of this book is that it belongs on the ""Greatly Reduced"" table at Barnes and Noble, and don't pay more than $1.00"
4,Good to use for passing the A+ Dos Windows exam,I used this book and the practice test CD from Total seminars. I scored a 89 on the Dos windows test. This book worked for me and it can work for you.
3,"nice ""first accessory"" for new users","i purchased this 1x memory card along with my game cube. a year and a half later, it is still going strong with game #12. as for my very first memory card, it's doing its job pretty well. too bad it only holds 59 slots, which fills up very quickly, especially with recent games, forcing you to make tough decisions letting go of save games... definitely does not compare to my recent purchase of 1019. to be honest, after you wear out of this cheap-o, go for the real deal, the 1019; definitely worth the investment.More or less I'm pretty satisfied with this MadKatz memory card."
2,Meh,It was nothing too pronounced. There was perhaps some feeling of calmness...maybe. Nothing very apparent though. One thing I did not like was how long it takes the sublingual tabs to dissolve. It actually would hurt the skin under my tongue
3,Improved quality of sleep,"I have gained nearly an hour of sleep each night and vastly improved the quality of my sleep by taking two pills at bedtime. I may still wake up several times a night, but after increasing the dosage to two pills, I usually go right back to sleep."
2,"Same Oh, Same Oh","I have all these patterns in another book. A waste of good money!I always read the reviews! From now on I will check out the books at a used bookstore, before I buy!"
4,"Just Like Honey, Sweet, Gooey and Good for the Soul","This was a wonderful fiction debut for Sue Monk Kidd. The way she mixed all the issues that surround our world past and present; racism, death, family, prejudice, strength, weakness, courage and forgiveness had a profound effect on me. This book has wonderfully drawn out characters and more importantly an underlining message that any warm blooded person can learn from. I strongly recommend this book to people who are ready to look inside thier selves and come to serenity. ...Again A Wonderful Book. A sequel would be bittersweet, I would love to see how the characters are in ten years, however sequels usually tend to stray from their original messages. Regards, Chasity"
2,A little too predictable...,"I felt this book was too predictable and there were too many 'themes' - racism, religion, feminism, traumatic childhood, romance...the list goes on. It seems as if it's trying too hard. That said, the interactions between the characters was nice, I'll admit, but not nice enough for me to tell a friend to spend a day reading this book."
2,The Secret Life of a Short Story,"You might think Sue Monk Kidd's The Secret Life Of Bees was some boring technical manual about insects. You'd be two-thirds right; it IS about bees and it IS boring. It also includes a story about a little girl in the mid-sixties South running away from her abusive father and occasional references to the civil rights movement of the time. While Ms. Monk has fine command of the English language, the story is tissue-thin. The novel has the same pace, content, and entertainment value as the mint-julep fueled afternoon musings of a group of southern matriarchs. The book began its life as a short story. It should have ended its life there as well. If you don't have a lot of time to kill but feel you must read this, read the first 40 pages and the last 25. If you have time to kill, you could read the entire book. Or you could just visit your grandmother and listen to her drone on about the family for a few hours."
1,"Simplistic, Unimaginative, Uninteresting","I found this book to be simplistically and pedantically written. The storytelling was certainly underdeveloped and almost trite. I not only would not recommend this book, I would tell others NOT to read it."
2,Over-rated. Don't bother,"I had heard of Sue Monk Kidd from articles in Guidposts magazine, and I must say I was surprised with all the goddess-worship in The Secret Life of Bees.The plot was too derivative, for the same type of setting I suggest the much stronger Nora, Nora by Anne Rivers Siddons.The novel was too long, the black/white confrontations werenaive and unbelievable, as were the great female characters.Also I found Lily's young age to be in doubt, she was too smartprecocious and intuative for her age. Fantasy, not fiction."
5,A Human Story,"I purchased this book after hearing about the movie; I wanted to read it before seeing the film. I was not disappointed. More than anything, this book is a reminder that we are all connected for good or bad. The story is colorful and inspiring. Do you want mystery, love, hate, an emotional train ride? You'll get all that and more. As a bonus, you learn about bees."
4,Bzzzzzzz,"The prose in this book is interesting and fresh, and the metaphors are vivid. That said, the plot is like a 1000 other books out there.The main character thinks there's a dark family secret. There is. She goes and finds some black people who are really angels in disguise (in effect though not literally) who can tell her what's wrong.I'm getting tired of angels disguised as black people. It's not original any more. Steven King did it in ""The Green Mile."" Chris Rock did it in ""Dogma."" Perfectly kind, sweet black people who can tell you all the secrets and have magic powers of healing (either emotional or physical) are a stereotype.Minna"
4,Lovely Story,"Kidd has such a colorful way with words that I hardly realized I was reading. I felt as though I was in the setting and could hear the conversations taking place in this novel. I would recommend this book, but only gave 4 stars because of the ending. I don't want to give too much away, but felt somewhat cheated. I felt like T. Ray was not reliable enough to tell the truth, so still am uncertain as to what really happened. I also wish the novel could have ended with the characters being much older. Perhaps progressing into the future a little further than the next year of high school would have been interesting. However this book is still a delight to read and a definite page turner."
1,"Not as expected, despite Dr. Dyer's review!",Lead in sez it all. . .wouldn't recommend this unless you're very bored!seven more words required so here they are. .
2,the secret life of bees,"The book is not in good shape as the seller described. Coffee stain on cover, the cover has fold marks and faded. The story is OK, the plot is not exciting."
3,so so,I have to agree with some of the other reviewers. Nicely written butg I kept trying to make connections between the bees and the sisters. I started this book twice over a year now and finally finished again. Why did it have so long for her to tell August about her mother? It just dragged on.... and had no exciting climax.
5,Simply beautiful and wonderful! A must read,"This is a beautiful novel, a wonderful gift, about a simple yet compelling message about the power of love. This is a must read, buy two copies and give one to your best friend, mother, daughter, sister. Beautiful language and images. I will read it again and again."
1,Utterly forgettable,"OK, we get it already. Honey is a metaphor for love. This book was both lame and laborious. Most of the book has August (and us) waiting for Lily to tell her story, so that August can fill in the blanks for her. It reads as though the author was trying to figure out what to do with all of her characters (for whom she obviously cares a gread deal), rather than tell us a good Southern Lit coming of age story. I got so sick of the sticky honey imagery and Lily's poor-me attitude. So her father is an unkind and unapproachable racist? I'd like to give Lily (and Kidd) a copy of Bastard out of Carolina. Now there's a young girl who deserves a jar of honey and a new family! In the end, everything turns out all right for Lily. Now that you know, you can find a better book."
5,The secret life Bees!!!!!,"Fiona Szende The Secret life of Bee's 12/3/04This is the most wonderful children's book I have ever read! The genre of this book is historical fiction. This book is about a girl named Lily who lives with her dad on a peach farm in Georgia. Her mother has died and her father is like a monster. It is in the time of the slaves so Lily runs away with the slave and they meet three strange sisters witch change their life forever.It is the most breathtaking, heart-jumping book I have ever read. It even made my cry. This book has gained a medal and it really deserved one! I loved that the author was sooo descriptive you felt like you were there. Of course I recommend his book, but mostly to people whom love sad and really exiting books. The secret life of bee's changed my life and it will change yours to."
5,AN AMAZING BOOK!!!!,I had to read this book for school. It is one of the best books I have ever read. It is a book for Mother & Daughters or Book club. Guys beware you will be bored by this read. This book was so good it made me cry. An amazing book; I would recommened it to ANYONE!!!!!
4,much better than I expected,"I expected sappy chick lit, but this was good. It's ""chick lit"", definitely, but it's not boring or overdone, in my opinion. It was a sweet story and having it against the backdrop of 1964 and the Civil Rights Movement added a lot to it. I could really empathize with the characters, and I always appreciate that in a book."
3,Not too bad...,"My title says it all. It was pretty good. I agree with the one reader that it started out with a bang, then kind of trickled off. Although there were some emotionally charged moments interspersed throughout the book, there were definitely some times that I just skimmed the page because there wasn't much going on. I'm not someone who has to have non-stop chaos and action in a novel, but at times the story seemed to lag, or get too caught up in description. I thought Lily needed to come clean a lot sooner than she did, and I couldn't help wondering what the hell she was doing when she called T. Ray collect. For a girl that seems pretty smart at times, I thought that was incredibly stupid.Overall, the book was pretty good, but if you're looking for a page-turner, I'd look elsewhere."
4,Very Pleased,"Read this book with ""The Time Traveler's Wife"" and ""My Fractured Life"" and was very pleased. It has a lazy Southern roll to how it drips off the page, almost like honey off a spoon."
5,a delightful read,"I would recommend this book to anyone with an interest in civil rights history, as well as a charming story of a girl coming of age. This book beautifully addresses everything from race and ethnicity, to prejudice, hate, love, forgiveness, and probably most beautifully, the feminine divine.The story is laced with a fascinating metaphor of bees, interconnected with the story of the heroine, Lily, as she journeys to unravel the truth about her mother's past."
5,Great Book for anyone,"Great, HeartWarming, Charming, Ispirational, Down-to-Earth,Intelligent, Historical recognition of civil rights"
1,The Empress Wears No Clothes,"After a recommendation by a friend, I got through about a dozen pages really wanting to like this girl and her story. Then I suddenly realized the writing was not that good, but pushed on. Finally I got bored and irritated and began to skim, hoping things would change. They didn't. The story comes at you with an agenda that doesn't work at all. The characters are trite, the situations inane, and the overall effect leaves you desiring to use a strong mouthwash. That's a shame because occasionally there were brief moments that worked, which were quickly defeated by the one-sided agenda.Perhaps she should have written a non-fiction book where she could get all this off her chest. But the best writing, in addition to providing an unbiased emotional experience, always moves beyond such and exists on its own plane. Unfortunately, this isn't even close."
3,A promising start...,"The introductory pages were engrossing, but somewhere between Lily's running away from home and arriving at the sisters' house, the book began to lose its initial electricity. I became increasingly frustrated with the one-dimensional characters and the contrived plotlines. I couldn't figure out whether Sue Monk Kidd was earnestly attempting to emulate the cliche-ridden prose style of a self-pitying 13-year-old's diary, or simply writes that way herself. The cynical part of me cringed whenever Lily had her encounters with the Madonna...or maybe I just couldn't relate. Mostly, though, I wish Kidd had deemed her characters worthy of a bit more human complexity. Someone noted that they liked the book when they realized that Lily was a survivor while her father was a coward. I would have gotten more out of the story if such growth-stunting labels weren't so readily applicable.It's basically a likeable book and a likeable story, and not without its good moments, but spotty overall."
4,Fast easy read,This was a book that I could not put down. If you love to see the barriers of color breaking down in history this is a good book. I do have to say that I wish there was more to the book. It ended way to fast I think there was so much more to this story that could have been told. But all and all I think it was a good read. Not disappointed at all.
5,really wonderful,"Everyone in my book club loved this novel. We do two books at a time, and this one was paired with THE SONG READER by Lisa Tucker, another great book. Try them both for a lively discussion!Betty Long"
4,"Not bad, not bad at all","Very likeable book. Well flowing tale as seen through the eyes of a naive white teenage girl living amongst many well-developed black characters. The family dynamics between the three 'bee' sisters was well done. Given the backdrop of civil rights, it never got preachy - the book let the reader make their own conclusions and opinions.I listened to the Unabridged audio version and loved the narractor's voice - she was right-on with capturing the tone of Lily.I recommend this - nothing too complicated, worth a look or listen."
2,Dry and slow-moving,"I like a book thats a page-turner. This was not. I was halfway through the book when I kept wondering when something was going to happen. Slow moving to the point of boredom. Author has colorful prose, but its not how an uneducated 14-yr. old girl would speak. Anti-climactic. I couldn't wait to finish the book so I wouldn't have to read it anymore!"
5,This book is mind candy,"The Secret Life of Bees by Sue Monk Kidd is one of the best books I have ever read. As a bookworm with tastes ranging from Gunter Grass to John Grisham, this is no small proclamation. The Secret Life of Bees is an easy read, and holds as much stimuli for the brain as it does for the heart. Read it...really."
3,Just not my style,"This book was just not my style. The writing was great and I can see why people love it, but for me the story was a little slow. In addition, I am not really into books about groups of women banning together to overcome tragedy-too realistic for my entertainment needs. I want a book to take me away from the realities of this world with an over the top storyline or make me want to be a teenager again. This was a little to close to the nightly news for me."
5,Time Well Spent & Worthy of A Second Read,"Ms. Kidd has presented the reader with a gift. Characters like these live & breath. Lily-14 years old & so deeply wise. T-Ray;father & tormenter.The Boatright sisters; May,June & August-sheer beauty & humanity. Their seperate personalities unfold on the pages like the silky petals of a camillia blossom.Simply Wonderous. Linking May with her ""Wailing Wall"" is too-too perfect.In the heart of this reader,May's deepening sensitivity to lifes cruelties spoke louder than expected.She resonates... After 9/11 many of us need such a wall. This story speaks to the heart. Buy it & plan to re-read. Give a copy to your sister. Then, send Ms. Kidd a ""Thank-You"" card for what she has produced is truly exceptional."
1,Childish and annoying,"This book is literally one of the worst books I've ever read. It's even worse than 'The Color of Water', which was terrible. I love character studies (such as 'Catcher In The Rye', 'Cujo', and 'Slaughter House Five'), and this book had shallow, confusing characters at best. The accent the characters had was moronic (I've lived in Texas, and been around deep Southern accents, and what the characters used was nothing like this), and the book had a superficial, immature perspective on race. Also, I couldn't shake the feeling that Sue Monk Kidd was some sad, anti-intellectual woman who watched soaps all day and the only training she had was a creative writting class at a community college. This book is filled with cliche and ersatz feminism. Read a classic. Don't read this."
4,The Secret LIve of Bees,"I loved the book, and then as a book club we all saw the movie together. The characters were PERFECT!The book is an easy, comfortable, feel good book. I highly recommend it. If you're more into a thriller, I just wrote and published my first book TAKEN. [...] See it!"
5,The Secret Life of Bees,"This book was thought provoking, funny, truthful and very touching. I needed to read it slowly so I wouldn't miss any of the details. A great book for a vaction, even if the vacation is in the comfort of your own home. Enjoy!"
1,Bad copy,"This copy of the Secret Life of Bees had chapters 2,3, and 4 missing! Don't buy it if you need it for a school report!"
4,Great Fiction Selection,"I hardly ever read fiction books, but this book I must say was pretty darn good...I listened to it on tape in the car, and my nine year old son even enjoyed it. I just feel in love with Lilly, and August. Great book. Great ending!"
3,An Easy Read,"The Secret Life of Bees"" is an entertaining book and an easy read. I enjoyed it very much, but it's not a great book. The author demonstrated that a family does not have to be a traditional composition. Many people's families can be made up of friends. Men don't nessecarilty have to be in a family. I ama single middle-aged woman , so the power of the 'daughters of Mary' hit home. But I am sure married women as well could relate to it. This novel doesn't have the universal appeal that say another southern novel""To Kill A Mocking Bird "" has but then that novel is a classic. After reading ""The Secret Life of Bees"" I want to form deeper bonds with my friends, live in a pink house , and develop with my friends some traditions. Read this book over a weekend. It's a chick book."
3,quite good,"The strong point of this novel is in the characters. The heroine, lilly, runs away from home with her family servant- a black woman called Rosaleen (think of 1960's Southern USA- to Kill a Mocking Bird etc). And are put up by a family of black sisters (real sisters) who keep bees and own their land living off the honey. The characters are beautifull (if a little caricatured) and the sisters, mainly matriarchal August look after young Lilly while she comes to terms with the early trauma of her life. On the downside, life with the sisters seems a bit rose -tinted to me with one of them, June, put in as obvious balance. It's not very challenging to read and all the religeous stuff grated on me after a while. The racist/victim side left me feeling I've seen it all before. But still worth a read."
3,Do you have a teenaged daughter?,"If you do then you should both read this together. I suggest this because it is a well written novel with interesting woman/girl relationships. The charaters and setting stay with you. The story itself is fine but not the kind of book that I look forward to the turning of the pages. If you are looking for something to share with your daughter, without getting too heavy, this is the book. You'll learn about bees and life and discrimination without a heavy hand."
3,"Okay, but doesn't live up to the hype","I read this book based on all the rave reviews it was getting in the press, and although it's a decent read, I think it's way overrated. It can get downright sappy in places. I think Sue Monk Kidd is a gifted writer, but her work is better aimed at the young adult crowd."
1,Hated it!,"I had to read this for my book club. One of the ladys in my club had read it and said it was ""the perfect book"". I was looking forward to it. Boy was I disappointed! Very predictable story. Her father was over the top mean, poor little Lily! It reminded me of crappy Jane Eyre! I guess Rosleen was to be some sort of comic relief but she was not very believable as a black woman in the south at that time . And I'm almost sorry to say this but I was relieved when May finally did herself in! You knew it was coming, why did it have to take so long? Also, too much narrative. This story could have been told in about 50 pages. Get to the point, I do not have time for drivel!"
2,Don't bother,The metaphor is thin at best; the characters are unidimensional and generally uninteresting. I don't understand what all the fuss is about.
2,knees' of bees,"Although I enjoyed the fanciful prose and metaphors, I felt like the author was holding back on many of the issues of abandoment,abuse,and racism that were introduced into the story early on and certainly could have been explored within the prose. I say ""cut loose, Sue"", write the story you are wanting to tell and you will elevate above the knees', perhaps even allowing more heart."
1,The secret's out,"Honey, this could bee the worst book ever. I'm not pollen your leg. Don't bee-lieve the buzz. Hive your children. Don't wax me why everybeedy stings this is such a good book. Wasp up with that?"
1,sappy and sentimental,"This is one of the sappiest most drippily sentimental novels I have ever read. The characters are cardboard cut-outs of good and evil, the prose is clunky and obvious and the whole book is just pandering and shallow. I would never have finished it if I didn't have to read it for my book group. Readers of serious, good fiction beware!"
5,a great read!!,"Set during the turmoil of the Civil Rights movement, the main character, a young white girl in the South, undergoes an amazing coming of age.This book was not only a wonderful, sad story, but a wondeful one. While I disagree with some of the beliefs portrayed in the book, it is still a wonderful story."
2,"Hard to swallow, even with a spoonful of honey","I hate to sound sexist, but Secret Life of Bees is the worst kind of chick-lit: overly sentimental, quaint, and ""cute."" It's the sort of book that's supposed to give you rosy cheeks and make you want to dance the conga in the rain. It's quirky for the sake of being quirky. Sue Monk Kidd herself said in an interview that she didn't know where the story was headed, which is extremely transparent. By the end of the book, the contrived story begins to collpase under the weight of its own silliness.Lily, the fibbing protagonist, reminds us in the book that to lie well, one must say as little as possible. Sue Monk Kidd should have taken her advice."
2,Not a favorite of mine,"The kind of sad depressing stuff that makes you finish it just to see how it turns out. Not one of my favorite books, way too heavy for me. A bit on the slow side."
3,Didn't meet my expectations,"This book was enjoyable, but little more than that -- I can't say it moved me emotionally or mentally. One of those books that I was engrossed in, but at the end was kind of like, ""huh."""
4,Cute Story,"This is a really cute, quick read. I thought it was filled with subtle good advice and I liked the way bees life make good analogies for ours. We are not as complex as we lead ourselves to believe!The plot is a little bit of a stretch, but if you don't think about that part and just enjoy the characters it is a good book about finding happiness."
5,Brilliant... a whole new respect for bees!,"This book is absolutely marvelous. Not only will you fall in love with all the characters, but you will fall in love with all the goodness life has to offer. The book revolves around a girl named Lily, a motherless teen living in the mid-1900s. After continuous friction between Lily and her father, T-ray, Lily is determined to leave her house. She sets out with her nanny and best friend to search for the answer to her questions about her mother. Little does she know, that not only will she learn more about her mother than she could have ever asked for, but she learns more about herself than she would have ever known. Lily is a remarkable character that will find her way into your heart, as will 'The Secret Life of Bees' itself. An excellent novel by Sue Monk Kidd!"
4,where the ordinary of life becomes divine,"This is a very good book. Most of the problems people have had with it are that, once Lily and Rosaleen end up at August's home (the beekeeper), things take a dive into fairytale land. Well, yes they do, and it is wonderfully done, in my opinion. Life at the beekeeper's home is not supposed to be like life in the outer world. If it was, the lessons would never be learned. Here, time slips, bees talk, and the ordinary becomes divine. If the ordinary cannot become divine and magical sometime in our lives, what's the point? It is a mythical fairytale and I think it is completely fun and heatwarming the way it is done. If you can take this book with a big grain of salt, you will enjoy it."
1,Boring book/ A waste of time,"I depend on reviews on Amazon to decide what to read next. I'd noticed this book several times and finally purchased it. The rating was 4 stars. I only give it 1. I am sorry I wasted the time I did reading this book. I did manage to finish it because I thought that surely, something appealing would happen. It didn't. Don't waste your time and money on this one."
3,Something Missing,"I purchased this book with much anticipation, particularly because of the author's use of the Black Madonna. I had read many reviews that were all favorable, including most of the reviews here. I also went to the author's website and read of her interest in spirituality and mysticism. For me, however, the language of the book was dry and lacking in originality. I could not connect with any of the characters, especially Lily, the main character. Although I finished the book, it was a real challenge. I was expecting something with more depth and a much richer grounding in spirituality. I plan to look into the author's autobiographical writings on her spiritual journey. I hope to find something on a deeper scale there. I will still give the novel 3 stars for incorporating the Black Madonna, an aspect of the Virgin Mary not found enough in literary works, into the story. This element does provide a unique aspect to the work, although the characters and language are missing something."
2,Another female-bonding story,"I should have known better. I am almost always disappointed when I read a book on the best-seller list. I usually use the list as my guide for what not to read.I have yet to read a book with female bonding as the theme that I enjoyed. Female-bonding stories just depress me. A bunch of women who can't function on their own become codependent.At the beginning, Lily was a feisty white fourteen-year-old who springs her black nanny from jail. The two set out on a quest to find a trace of Lily's mother's past. When they reach their destination, the female bonding starts, and the book gets boring. The beekeeping background and the religious rites involving a black Mary don't help.Foolishly, I'm now going to try ""Life of Pi,"" another best-seller with animals. I probably won't like it either."
3,"Sweet, But Not My Taste in Books",I did like it but I didn't feel the four-star zone with it.There were parts of the book that really had me turning pages and then I found myself sometimes zooming through and dare I say....skimming. I'm not sure whether this is because I was actually trying to get to the end to find out what happens...but either way I think I wasn't fully engrossed.Lovely plot though. And the movie was fantastic!
2,Overrated,"I wish I could be more positive about this book, but I found the characters to be one dimensional and unbelievable--a little too much honey."
3,"Sweet, but not believable","Secret Life of Bees got lots of good reviews, but I didn't feel it lived up to its promise.The characters were wonderful, and the dialogue was beautifully rendered. But the entire premise read more like a fairy tale.I wish I'd borrowed it from the library instead of purchased it in hardback."
5,One to treasure,"My only regret with reading this book, was that I rushed the ending the first time. This was due to utter anticipation. A gem of a book! The beginning is slow- stick with it! I have talked to many with similar reactions. The beginning is important so read it, but the middle and on made it the best book! It is my favorite only tied with The Lovely Bones."
4,Excellent!,Im 14 years old and i absolutely loved this book. I could relate my feelings to those of Lily Owens. The material contained in the book is suitable for anyone 13years and older.I hope you enjoy it as much as I did!
4,"Good Read, Good Characters, nicely written","The Secret Life of Bees is a Good Read with highly developed chacters and is nicely written. There are slow moments in the middle of the book, but stick with it, it all comes together smoothly. Marjorie Spoto - Author, When It Rains."
4,Intriguing!,This book is great if you are sick of cheesy fiction novels. Very interesting and well written.
2,would have been a good book,I had to read this book for summer reading.This book has a really good story line. I liked how August and Lily had a relationship. I think this book would have been good if they didn't put the Mary and statue religon in it.I thought it was inapporite. How could anyone think a piece of wood (it's what the statue is) could acually hear your prayers. Or Mary who is a sinner just like us and is dead. Jesus died on the cross for our sins!! The name of the tile should have been The secret life of the statue. Also there were too many swears in this book!I know T Ray is mean like that but the author could of just wrote that T Ray Swore.I would not recommend this book!
4,A fast read,"I give this four stars because the author clearly poured her heart into it and at no point did I want to put it down.But it stopped short of five stars for one reason only: it didn't resonate with me. I know authors are supposed to 'write what they know', and I read in the addendum that Sue grew up in the south.I grew up in Minnesota. I found the whole issue of racism in this book bordering on cartoonish. Would an officer really let a group of men into a cell so that they could beat out an 'apology'? Eh.A recommended read nonetheless."
2,Not authentic,"I was five years old when my Catholic family moved to the deep South in 1963. Perhaps I missed something about Catholicism and Southern race relations when growing up, because very little in this book seemed authentic to me. After the narrative immediately pulled me in with its pivotal opening event, I read it in its entirety in one day. I concluded that it is not a work of historical fiction, but rather a fairy tale, mildly bizarre at times with the barest connection to historical or cultural contexts. It's marginally entertaining and certainly not important. I was shocked to notice that this book had been required reading in the school honors course of one of the reviewers."
3,Money well spent,"Here's the great thing about this book: it's a fast read. The bad thing: it's not easy to follow. I found it tough to keep up with the cast of characters, and felt that the author is a bit predisposed to pointing out everyone's Jewish faith, religious observances etc. As a result, many of the characters blended together. A lot of focus on the heritage of the characters here, almost to the point of distraction. Bottom line though, as a shareholder, this book made a hell of a lot more sense to me than did the quarterly and annual reports. In all, a good book about a sad story that is well priced. The author has done his homework. I would have loved about another 100 pages of detail here and there though to help with the transitions. And again, a little less focus on the faith of everyone involved."
5,I learned a lot,"Especially after the Spiderman movie, I wondered about the Marvel company. I ended up learning about bankruptcy, two Israelis running Marvel now, and a bunch of surprises. There are some funny bits, too."
4,"Great Book, Questionable edition","""Comic Wars"" should be looked upon as an important predecessor to James B. Stewart's ""DisneyWar"". Its look at high financial battles in the entertainment industry featuring ""men who act like beasts"" in the capitalist class who are more concerned about the bottom line then whether valuable product can be made and sold, along with the one stakeholder who wants a better leveling of profit and artistic values (as they are in the mainstream comic book industry) striking back reminds the reader heavily of Stewart's tale.One star is docked as follows:- A 1/2 star is docked for the author's decision to have this edition of the book published by Marvel itself (Perlmutter), taking odious trends in this type of business journalism one step forward.- Another 1/2 star is docked by ""Heroes Books"" (Marvel) for its job as publisher; several small black dots were noted throughout the pages of the book, and an index entry is missing its page numbers"
2,File handle,"This file handle is unsatisfactory when used in larger files or rasps, the opening for the file tang is too small and narrow. I was unable to mount my larger size files."
1,Bland,"Leave it to Disney to ""throw some sex and money at it"" and hope for the best.Persephone is portrade as a prostitute, cleavage and sex referenced everywhere.How sad.I had heard they were good books, but have no desire to read them now."
2,Great visual effects; crappy story,"Like many others, I read the five books before I saw the movie. (I'm an adult, but my nephew was reading them at the time.)My biggest gripe is the age difference. In the movie version, Percy is older at the start of the series than he was at the END of the fifth book.I don't really miss Dionysis or Ares, but I think Clarisse (daughter of Ares) was too important a character to be left out. I also don't like that the heroes weren't sent on a quest. Excuse me, but going on quests is what heroes do.Despite the fact that I would rather have seen a much younger actor play the lead, Logan Lerman was very good. Kevin McKidd's opening scene was much better than his closing one. Brendan T. Jackson, as Grover, also gave a good performance, but I didn't care for the sexualization of his role.The special effects and computer graphics were the movie's strong points.It wasn't a bad movie, but it wasn't a good movie, either."
5,Absolutely loved it!,Highly recommend this movie! It's cute with just the right action and suspense. My 6 year old loves the books and loves the movie just as much. I can't wait for the next movie.
2,disappointing,"I read the entire Percy Jackson series and was kept on the edge throughout each book of the action scenes portrayed. When a movie was released I couldn't wait to go and see it. I was envisioning those scenes from the book and imagining the way that they would come across on the big screen. I also told myself to not get too excited that most books that become movies do not always turn out the way we all wish for. This movie was an absolute disappointment. Even if I never read the book the excitement was just not there. They focused on one main objective and left out soo much for the viewer to take in and experience. What a waste of time to watch, I am glad that I only paid to rent the movie."
3,Nothing like the book!,"It's a cool movie but,It doesn't go with the book at all.I don't recommend seeing this if you have or are going to read the book!"
2,"terrific, awesome","Great , Terrific, Awesome movie. I bought this for my son who is 10 years old, he read the book and now has watched this movie about 8 times or more in about a month."
5,"Very, Very, Very, Very ... Satisfied Customer","The above product (DVD Movie) arrived in a very short length of time which, first of all, really impressed me. It was packaged like a new movie and it played entirely just fine.I am a very,very,very,very satisfied customer. I will continue to give you my business in the future. Keep doing what you do!!!!!!!!!!!!!!"
3,Meh,"From the title it looks like a Young Adult film (didn't know it was based off of a YA book series) and I was expecting something with production values like Harry Potter or even the Spiderwick Chronicles -- that didn't happen. The story was a bit too fast paced, the acting a bit canned, and the scripting kept me expecting a commercial break. This would have been better as a pilot for a TV series as it could have been fleshed out a bit more."
2,"watchable, but that's it","While the film is basically entertaining if nothing better's available, it simply has no luster. Special effects are OK, nothing earth-shattering, and the plot you've seen before in a thousand other myth-based films. Why all the hype?"
5,Loved it!,"My kids (4 and 7) love this movie! A little scary, but not too scary (although my kids are a little ""tougher"" in that respect than most same-aged kids), and they love the Greek mythology theme. Scary but not gorey."
2,Not so good!,"This was an awful attempt at making a movie from a book. They cut corners, changed characters, changed locations and missed entire sections of critical plot development. Beyond the names, the similarity between the book and movie are minimal at best."
1,Good Spec's poor quality,"I have had two of these units. The first unit I took back to the store within 30 days to get a new one. The second one is not much better. The unit regularly locks up or powers down and can be a very frustrating experience when converting a large library of VHS to DVD. I've tried using DVD-RW or DVD+RW disks but it makes no difference in the performance of the unit. I was hoping DVD+RW would cause the unit to behave better because it is a far superior specification to DVD-RW. The unit is spec'd to play DivX movies too, but I have yet to get the unit to play one. I have flashed the unit with the latest firmware from Panasonic but I see no difference in performance. I suspect the firmware code is poorly written and little to no QA was performed on the unit.I am very disappointed in Panasonic's flag ship DVD recorder."
1,Should have listened......,"It appears this unit is a piece of junk.I should have taken the other negative reviews i read here a bit more seriously.Never got a chance to try out the recorder portion.It plays cd's for about 6 seconds and then turns itself off.At one point it froze up with a ""hello"" message and i had to unplug it and plug it back in so i could get my cd out.Taking it back tomorrow."
1,not happy,"Panasonic DMR-EZ47VK Up-Converting 1080p DVD-Recorder/VCR Combo with Built In TunerA big disappointment got it for Christmas and it stopped working by February sent it back to Panasonic via UPS on 03/03/08 via Panasonic instructions. It arrived on the 10th according to Panasonic records. It is now the 24th of March and I called the Panasonic service number included in the mail back instructions and they are on central time so they are closed. Customer service has no access to the status. I was directed to call back during IL office operating hours. Great service! No status updates.... So it worked about 30 days, before it locked up and showed HELLO then 0000 0000.I would not buy Panasonic again based on their concept of customer service."
1,Bad Warrantee Service,"I have always bought Panasonic or Technics So i bought this unit 6 months ago. It worked for 6 months then suddenly the unit would not recognize a previously played store bought DVD, nor would it eject it. Talked with support still not working. They said they were sending me a shipping label to have it sent in and fixed under warrantee. OK, at least I thought. A week later nothing in the mail. I call beck, they apologize and tell me they would mail me one and e-mail me one. Well days later no e-mail from them at all. I sent an e-mail asking about my case and the label. No answer.These are the facts...no opinion offered"
2,After 9 months...kaput,"I have had this machine for 9 months and it has been okay. Plays DVD's in very good quality. It does not record in HD to DVD from a cable box. It is grainy to say the least downgrades to 480P for recording...sucks! Somewhat difficult to setup machine; now does not work, shows U99 on display and is frozen, only turns on and off and displays U99. Power down and back up=U99. Still under warranty but have to take it 261 miles away for warranty work. Cost of mailing is ridiculous. This thing is going in the trash."
3,Good But Frustrating to use,"Overall, after 4 months of ownership, I regret buying the Panasonic DMR-EZ475V. While the quality of the recordings is VERY good, the machine is frustrating to operate. The response time is very SLOW when you press any of the commands. My biggest frustration is getting it to record at all. The instruction manual is laid out in a step by step format, but some of the steps are missing! Simple explanations are missing too. This leads to wasted time and effort due to the trial and error it takes to get the machine to function properly.I know Panasonic laid off many of their copywriters-BIG MISTAKE! I chose the Panasonic DMR-EZ475V for it's newer features. This player supports a wide variety of discs; has the ability to record to DVD +/- R Dual Layer DVD-RAM and DVD pictures can display at 480i/p, 720p, 1080i/p. Once you get used to it, it is a good recorder with some nice features. Panasonic needs to pay more attention to writing the manual though."
5,Panasonic DVR with DVD_RAM,"Its all I expected it to be...Top quality, excellent picture, easy to use and set-up, great HD, I love the dvd ram disks: up to 8 hrs on a 4.7gb disk and with a VCR to boot! Records both ways...DVD to VCR and back. I refuse to eliminate all my old tapes and now I can put them on DVD, even tapes from my old video recorder. Its true Nirvana. True state of the art. Its a Gotta Have item for all."
4,Panasonic EZ 47V,This is the second unit I have purchased. It is comprehensive in its performance and easy to navigate. The ATSC and NTSC tuners are very good. The image quality of HD recorded discs is excellent. This second unit a refurbished product and in performance it matches the unit I bought initially. It meets my expectations.
3,Disappointed.,"I was really disappointed with this book--and returned it unread--because of the really poor quality of the photos. They looked like they had been scanned in at a very low resolution and, hence, were so grainy you could not make out the details. A real oversight on the part of the editor!"
2,Apparently designed to accompany classroom lectures.,"Many pages use the same map with differing troop positions. Repeated maps use same title block boiler plate with misleading dates. Text blocks that descibe troop movements blot out many place names. Text blocks have small print and are difficult to read. Some key court houses, farms, towns, fords, bridges are omitted when the was sufficient white space to include them."
5,A Lovely piece of art...,"How much fun is this toy?Mmm... this is not precisely a toy. Much more a Statuette. Actually, it IS a Statuette. Not for Kids.How would you rate this toy's educational value?Educational... well, it would be useful in Anatomy classes i think (LOL). More than that fact, i don't think it's quite educational.How durable is this toy?Very, as long as you take every single care you can. As i said before, this is not a toy and not for kids. For the proper Collector, this Statuette will last centuries (I warned my family to bury me with it when i die).How do you rate this toy overall?10... loved it. Leia in Slave suit is a cornerstone for a all new nerds generations since 1983. This is fine piece of art that serves well as a religious icon to worship the goddess of Sci-Fi and Space Opera.My regards!!!"
1,Bad side effects,"I got this for my mother and she said It caused her terrible headaches and the area of her breast skin was very hot and it feels like burning. She got scared and stopped using it. She is currently on Tamoxifen, I don't know if that could have been the cause for this reaction, but I got the cream for her because somebody recommended to me and told me it would really make her feel much better, but it only make her feel worse."
5,Works fine [used to smell bad]...see updated review,"This was my first time using this product. I'd been using Pro-gest by Emerita for 3 yrs...liked it fine but thought I'd try a product with a pump. First of all, I realized I can eye-ball the correct amount as well as the pump measures it out, so no points for that. Then there is the smell...it is very similar to cooking oil that is starting to go rancid. Not pleasant. Anyway, maybe it was just a bad batch or something, but I will definitely be going back to Emerita's product.May 2012Tried the Care-Complete version of this product [with a little DHEA and 7-Keto added] and love it. Very pleasant smell and seems as effective as Emerita. I now prefer Life-Flo and like the pump after-all as I realized I actually CANNOT eye-ball the exact dose...so, mea culpa. Definitely received an old product on that original order, and it's good to see that Life-Flo now has a ""use by"" date on their products. This one is a keeper!"
1,It did not fit the format of my player,I put it in my DVD player the day it arrived. On the screen it flashed a message saying it was the wrong format. That was a real pity. I have the movie on VHS but was looking forward to a DVD with all the special features. I always loved the movie. The acting was great and the atmosphere made you feel like you were really in that period of time. I'll have to try again to get another DVD.
5,Daria Rocks!!,"True, the music was cut out by MTV, but Daria herself is still the same-an idol to be worshipped as a goddess. :) Now if MTV will just put the rest of the videos out..."
5,another great lego product!,"This is a great product for lego addicts who enjoy the construction/city sets. My son has played with this for hours, and it blends well with the other sets he has. legos are a toy that you can feel good about as they combine creativity and spatial ability in a fun pursuit."
1,Yawn...,Of all the Cayce books I've read and enjoyed and eventually pass on to friends for their enjoyment... this was not one of them :-) total waste of time and money in my humble opinion thank you.
4,"Good mat, not enough chips","I like the felt mat, but felt for the price the chips were cheap and there were not very many chips included with the game."
5,tripoley,I have had this game before but gave to someone as a gift so needed to purchase another game .
4,YEA!,"The title promises exactly what is in the book. You get examples, little excercises and come away with tools that work. I immediately put into use what I was learning. I came out with the results I was hoping for, and not my usual frustration and sometimes anger, blaming them for not listening.A definite read for anyone at any age. For home, work or friends; where communication is essential. Is there anywhere in life we don't need communication that flows? I'm looking forward to practicing this method until it becomes my normal approach."
3,Not the same as the book.,"The CD version lacks a lot of what the book has. I feel like that I didn't learn anything. I have a copy of the soft cover book, and that has much more in it. Save your money and don't try to ""cheat"" buy buying audio. Go straight for the book."
1,It is the worst book I have ever owned.,"I read the reviews at Amazon.com before buy any book. Usually, I have pretty good luck if the general review comments are positive. But this time around. I was cheated.The worst thing I dislike is that it streches an one page contents into five or ten pages.If you want to read something about interpersonal communications, I suggest you to check out Dale Carnegie's master pieces. This book is a waste of your money and time in my opinion.Good luck."
4,Crucial Conversations-Rocked my world,I ordered this book to help my in my presonal direct sales business. I needed to gain words to use while talking up my products. I needed help in communicating with my contacts to get the desired affect from them. I had no idea this book would affect my personal life as well!I am able to see how I interact with others in my conversations. Which showed me that I am just as guilty in my fights with my husband.I now am working to finish the book but in the first couple of chapters I was able to work on significant changes to help me in all aspects of my life.I was looking more a book to help with Sell Converstaions for words to use but this book will be a resource for all walks of my life.
1,Employers don't put your employees through this nonsense!,"Yes I've read the book and taken the miserably long 18 hour course. 18 hours that could easily have been condensed into 4 hours. This is nothing but the typical business self help garbage that has been regurgitated for a younger audience of cubical dwellers. If you have an ounce of common sense you will already know most of the expensive ""tools"" that the authors go to great wordy lengths to impress you with. The course was an unorganized mess that used plenty of useless acronyms.Employers don't waste your money on this ridiculous course or book. I have yet to find even ONE co-worker that thought the reading or taking of the course was valuable."
5,Good foundation for working on tough issues together,"This is a great book for those of us that consult with family businesses, although I have also often used it with my large, publically traded clients, too.I frequently ask that everyone on the management team read it, and then follow up by going through the key communications methods in a 1-2 hour session. This then becomes a foundation for - or a language for - how to communicate on sensitive issues going forward. Well written and useful."
4,Margarita Mix,"This item was sent as a gift but seems to be enjoyed by recipient. Great selection of ""hot"" food items."
5,Beyond words,"This book is an absolute masterpiece. One of the best of our times. Dr. Faye's journey itself was incredible. His mission or obsession to save the central African is relentless. This book is a tribute to him, Nick Nicols, whose photography surpasses anyone's both in quality and purpose, and to the deepest, darkest Africa.Also recommended - Traces of Eden: The Last of the American Wilderness"
5,"I like drugs, they make me happy :)","So here I am at night with a cold and a headache and all I want to do is sleep and feel better. But the headache makes it harder to sleep and so I take this... Then the headache goes away...and I sleep. Version 2: I work all week waking up at 6:30 in the morning and when the weekend comes I can't sleep in because I am so use to waking up early. So...I take this stuff at night and the effects are still with me in the morning and it lets me sleep in. Version 3: I don't like my life anymore...Overall this is a great product, just follow the directions (like you should with all drugs, weather swallowed, drunk, eaten, or smoked, and enjoy the effects). Also, on that note, this will not help you hear colors or see little elves or the carpet move, but just as I don't condone Version 3, I also don't think you should be being hearing colors or seeing little elves though chemicals...unless you follow the directions.Take care and enjoy your better living through chemistry!!"
4,A Very Good Debut Album.,"Black Oak was an interesting mix of Hard Rock, Folk, Blue Grass, Southern Rock, Sex, and Religion. They also were a very talented band, Jim Dandy though criticized as a singer has a unique voice that cannot be duplicated by anyone and no one can say otherwise. Rickie Reynolds and Harvey Jett are very good Guitar players, Pat Daugherty a fine Bass player. and Wayne Evens good on drums. These guys laid down [such great] music and Jim Dandy provided the cockiness and showmanship that completed the band (Ask David Lee Roth). This album Black Oak Arkansas was There Debut and is very very good, Highlights are Uncle Elijah Elijah, Hot N Nasty, Lord Have Mercy On My Soul and When Electricity Came To Arkansas. All became concert favorites."
2,Didn't work for me,"I bought this product to help mask the redness that was a result of a chemical peel. It may be a great product if you use a matte finish foundation, which I don't as I have dry skin. It goes on very dry and doesn't really hide the red spots as well as I hoped it would. I have no doubt that it is a good for the skin product, it just isn't as good as the claims it makes.It will leave your skin more grayish than green, which I found hard to cover over with foundation. The areas that it was applied too before foundation, were left pasty and too light. If you rub it into the skin good, the red still shows, if you don't rub it in good then you will see exactly where it was applied. I was hoping for something a bit more creamy in texture and not so dry. I only recommend this product if you have small areas of red such as blemishes and use a matte finish foundation for oily skin."
4,:0) ;0),Love it.Body chemistry loveeeeeeeeeeeee that story thought it was so cute. Like the others even Jaid Black
4,Awesome characters!,"I loved this book! The characters are wonderful - I recognized in them bits of myself and other people I know. The book has a clever format - a series of letters written between the 2 main characters. It is funny, raw, and inspiring. I can't wait for Ms. O'Brien's next book!"
1,wot no website,"This is actually quite a good book that provides a rather broad overview of different aspects of .NET. However, I do not feel I can recommend the book unfortunately because the support website with example code promised on the back cover (and in the book) does not exist. (I do not think this is justified at all given the book's age.) There is example code in the book, of course, but it is an incomplete excerpt of what is supposed to be on the website. The publisher has declined to reply to a e-mail message asking about the missing website."
4,Refreshing and new,"Finally....someone gets it right!! A nice blend of smooth r&b and hip hop, with a gangsta edge to it. Felt that the lyrics and writing could of used a little more work, but the sound of this album is incredible. A must have for all hip hop fans world wide."
4,My kids love it!!!,"My twin 3yr. olds received this as a present several weeks ago. Once we figured out how to adjust the picture (turn the red part), it became their new favorite toy. They want to play with it all the time and even take turns picking the reel and pressing the buttons. We have theTOY STORY - Super Sounds Cartridge with 3 Talking ViewMaster ReelsandSuper Sounds Safari Reelsin addition to the one it came with that make noise. The noises are really not that special, just a funny sound or one line from the movie, but the boys love them. It is a nice change to hear them asking to watch this toy instead of a movie. As for durability, ours has been dropped, thrown, and tripped over and still works fine. I am looking forward to acquiring new reels, though. ""To infinity and beyond"" has gotten old in my book - but not in theirs!"
2,It's OK...I guess...,"My trouble with this toy is that the sounds do not correspond to the pictures on the reels. We bought this for our two little grandsons and they opened it Christmas Day. It worked with the sample reel that came with it, but when we put in any three of the ""Babies in the Wild"" reels, the commentary was just all wrong and very random. A growl for a picture of baby bunnies. Describing a jaguar with a picture of a whale or some seals. A gurgling sound of water with the picture of a baboon. Just wacky. We tried turning the reels every which way and taking them all out of the sound cartridge, etc., but everything we tried made no difference. So, we have two little boys (2 & 3) that are being told that something is an orangutan when it is actually an armadillo! Help...not good! We will buy another set of reels and see if the problem lies with that set, but so far, I'm not all that happy with this purchase."
1,Way too thick.,"This is more like a brown gravy that a traditional Au Jus. We tried some for French Dip Sandwiches, and the result was a thick unappetizing mess"
4,Compass is right on course,"As a person with a special interest in boat navigation, this book caught my attention. I have other books on the subject, but I could recommend this one without reservation. It combines a history of the mariner's compass as developed in the west (with some comments on Chinese systems) with a great deal of technical information about compasses and compass use. It does all this in an easily-readable form. The information is spaced out with appropriate anecdotes so one is not hit with a lot of technology all at once. Readable and useful."
2,Get on with it!,"I listened to this book - or, at least, the first hour of it (I gave up at that point). The problem, at least with regard to the first 1/5 of the book, is two-fold: First, there is no coherent narrative. The author jumps to and fro without any apparent theme. Second, what interesting history there is seems an afterthought to lengthy descriptions and explanations. I gave up at the point the author was listing ancient classification of ""winds"" ad nauseam. Maybe it got better after that. I'll never know."
2,i'll pass,"Studying Eastern European histry, this book came as a shock to me for its lack of depth and truth concerning this region of Europe. The first constitutional monarchy in Europe, Poland, is given no credit for its Constitution of May 3rd, 1791. In fact, it's not even there at all. Other misleading factoids have the Lithuanian state 'defeating the Teutonic knights at Tannenberg', while in reality they only constituted about a third of the Polish force. So, in general, this book goes nowhere new; it overgeneralizes and misrepresents Eastern Europe while glorifying the big two; France and England."
2,A summer's vacation for sure!,"Roberts' The Pengin History of Europe contains detailed information of European history. Beginning with the Stone Age ending in the 20th century. Europes' influence on government, economics, and religion are covered in detail. Greek, Roman, Asian, Italian, Germans, Russian, and even American history have been influenced by Europes will and power. If you are a historian or history professor, Roberts' discussions will have you yearning for more. For us less scholarly students, it is a reader's nightmare."
5,Two Glass Shelves for the Kitchen,"We wanted glass shelves to display colorful glasses in the kitchen and this contemporary cable worked out great. Due to the height of the upper wall bracket from the shelf we staggered the shelves, overlapping using a cantilever. It all worked with 6"" and 8"" x 3/8"" glass shelves. The cables and supports were easy to put up and made very well."
1,AWFUL!,"Broke out in a rash that lasted for 3 weeks after I used this stuff, maybe I was allergic to something in it but it has cause me lots of discomfort in the anal area ... too bad I bought two, what a waste. Cost me a visit to a dermatologist too! Never again!"
2,"size, content a problem","I bought this book once, in 2000, and hated it because it is so narrow you cannot easily xerox a page or two-all you realistically need when hitting the road. Although this guide does list a few international museums-all easily found on the internet, the usa coverage is really underpar compared to the many wonderful museums out there. Every year I wait for Judith Swirsky to publish On Exhibit-art lovers travel guide to american museums and I buy it. She gives you a great overview of the strengths or weakness of a particular collection as well as a summary of travelling exhibitions."
2,"nice, but not like other travel movies","Two likable dudes who do a bike ride. The bike ride however is rather short and kind of uneventful, so they struggle for content. Some funny moments, some nice landscapes, but by no means as extreme or special as some other travel movies."
4,Life Saver,"I purchased this thermos during summer 2011's sweltering heat wave. It came in very handy for keeping liquids nice and cold all day. Even in my van in the blistering heat while I worked at a site, the thermos kept the liquid nice and cold. It was a life saver being able to slake my thirst between jobs w/ ice cold tea or whatever cold beverage I had in the thermos that day. 40oz doesn't get me through the day though, so for summer 2012, I'll likely be purchasing a 2nd Thermos Work Series 40oz. Prefer that over one (heavier and bulkier) larger-capacity thermos.This is a well made and durable thermos. It seals very well. I understand from reading reviews there are a lot of lemon thermos' out there. This most definitely isn't one of them."
5,Great bottle,This insulated bottle will keep hot coffee all day. I have forgotten to empty it out on Saturday afternoon and still have hot coffee Sunday evening. If you want your coffee to stay hot I highly recommend this bottle.
5,A beast!!!,"This vacuum bottle is an absolute beast! Keeps my coffee hot all day or night fishing the beach October-December. Strong, easy to carry with a great handle and a cup that actually works well and fits in cup holders. Would purchase another without question."
1,This was a bad book,"You have to wonder why this book was ever written! The characters are edgy and precocious, but they are totally unlikeable. If this is supposed to be an imitation of Salinger's Franny and Zooey, then it has failed miserably. If it is not a bad imitation of Salinger, then this author needs to find a more interesting group of characters to endlessly explore. Bottom line: The book needs characters that are compelling, not totally annoying, and it needs a real plot and a theme that almost anyone can relate to--like Good vs. Evil. Go back to the drawing board. A novel needs to engage the reader."
3,All but one of Farrar's contributions are instrumentals.,"Haven't seen the movie but a fan of Jay Farrar. I trusted the other reviews and bought the CD after hearing ""Gather"" (another fabulous tune by Farrar) on YouTube. Turns out it was the only Farrar song with vocals. The instrumentals are all excellent and most of the other songs are also. It's just not what I expected or hoped for ... guess I'll have to look for the new Son Volt. At least this keeps in tact my general opinion that soundtracks are not the way to go."
1,Not what you expect from Maclaren,We purchased this stroller for our new baby and it has been nothing but trouble. First when we were using the stroller with the car seat holder we took the stroller out and placed the car seat on the stroller and the car seat with the baby in it started to fall off. Luckly my husband was there to catch the car seat. When I called Maclaren they didn't care! The problem is when you fold the stroller it causes the seat holder to unlock. After less then a year the stroller lost a nut so now you can not use it at all. Again we called Maclaren for a replacement part but nobody returns your phone call. Also the fabric trim on the stroller wears off and an older child @ 9 months old does not sit well in this stroller. For the amount of money this thing cost it should be a lot better!
1,This was NOT the first DVD-Single in history,"Trivia buffs and Madonna fans who have been waxing over how Madonna has become a pioneer for the DVD age by making 'Music' the first ever DVD single should step back and research what they're saying. It is now widely understood that Bjork's 'All is full of love' was the first DVD-Single in history, yet due to aggressive promoting by Maverick and the confused DVD industry, this DVD has been listed as the first. Just goes to show how hype and marketing can twist the facts."
3,"Decent video, good song, but where are the extras?","Gotta hand it to Madonna for pioneering another new music video format, the DVD single. (Remember the Justify My Love video single back in 1990?) Great idea. It's certainly an interesting looking video, she looks fab, and it's also nice to see her hanging with former cohorts Debi Mazar and Niki Harris again. If you're a fan, you'll be more than pleased. But there are only two tracks on this thing, and as far as I could tell the only difference between the two is some additional dialogue between M and the obnoxious limo driver. How about a making-of? Deleted scenes? Commentary? I mean, even some lyrics would have been nice, but there's nothing extra, and only two tracks is pretty bare-bones for an $8.99 list price. And how about a 5.1 sound mix? The video and song gets 4 stars, but the actual content of the DVD gets 1."
1,Don't buy this CD,"Juno Reactor are far too awesome to be summed up in one tiny little compilation album. It's totally worthwhile getting all their earlier albums so why bother with this? If you like what you hear on this you'll most likely want to go grab their other albums as well anyway. Even if you're new to JR, I recommend starting off with 'Shango' instead! You won't be disappointed, Juno Reactor rule!!"
5,Quick and reliable tuner,"I purchased this guitar tuner 4 years ago and it's been a good investment and welcome piece of equipment to have and carry. It's small enough to fit in your music bag, it has a nice clip that holds onto the bottom of your music stand, and it's very easy to use. Just turn the tuner on and play your note, the tuner automatically find the note you're tuning to and tells you what adjustment to make, without any beepers or annoying sounds. A red or green light also tells you whether you're in tune in additional to the directional lights telling you which way to tune. You can play and tune unplugged or use your amp cord and plug directly into the tuner itself. We actually bought this because it's what the guitar teacher used in class for my sons and it seemed really easy to use. Recommended!"
5,Was cheper a week later,"Very good safe . If someone wants it , they well have to take the wall with it.The code that I put in was easy to do , and it is very easy to use . The only thing that I did'nt like is that the price came down after I received it."
1,DO NOT BUY THIS SAFEBOX,"be aware of this cheap product, I bought one in September 29 of 2011, and yesterday the combination lock started to make a noise when I try to open the safe that was the last time that work. DO NOT BUY THIS SAFEBOX, spend a little more and find something Better."
5,Stack on Safe,This is a perfect safe for small spaces. Easy to operate and fits most anyplace and can attached to a wall or floor.
1,Bad Experience,"I purchased the Stack-On PS-514 Personal Safe with Electronic Lock from (name deleted, per Amazon.com) for $44.99. The packaging was damaged as described, and appeared to have been returned previously, which I don't have a problem with. However, the safe would not open with the keys provided in order to program the keypad, so it was useless. The unnamed seller offered me the choice of a full refund or a partial refund and I could obtain replacement keys on my own from Stack-on. I opted for a full refund. However, I had to cover all the shipping costs. I paid $32.23 for expedited shipping and $12.89 for the return shipping, so I'm out of pocket for $45.12, more than the cost of the item, and I'm still without my safe. The safe seems like it would have been decent, if it actually worked."
1,Defective Lock,"This is the second safe that was shipped to me. I returned the first one because the lock would not turn after the combination was entered. I could finally open it after playing with the handle. Never could get it to work properly. Returned the safe and got the second one. This time the safe would not lock at all. The handle would open and close at will. Nothing I could do to lock the safe. Needless to say I will be looking for another safe. One good note about the whole transaction. Shipping took just two days to Hawaii. Also, when the first safe was returned I got the next one in two days. This is just excellent service from Amazon, especially during the busy Christmas season."
4,Overall Nice Safe,"Overall the safe is well constructed and simple to use. Battery compartment and door seems a little flimsy. Also the (gray) face plate appears to be made of plastic so not sure if there is any sort of vulnerability behind that. Amazon's price is a bit higher than other sites (others selling @ $49). The manual has a typo regarding disabling the beep sound. You need to enter *663 to disable the beep (not *633). WARNING: If anything within the safe presses up against the back of the door when you close it, there is a chance that the lock will not engage properly. I encountered this several times and the lock actually locked, but if I jiggered the latch back and fourth rapidly a few times (I'm paranoid with the kids) I could get the lock to disengage and the safe opened. I assumed this was due to the issue I mentioned. Since then I make sure nothing presses against the back of the door and that there is sufficient clearance and all has been fine ever since."
1,Opened with a paperclip.,I thought the video I saw online was a hoax. Yet I tried it to be sure. I did not even try very hard. In under a minute I had my safe open. That was my first ever attempt at cracking a real safe. I have since seen similar videos for other safes but they required actual burglar tools. I don't expect a cheap safe to stand up to burglar tools but I do expect it to withstand common items found in my own office desk drawer. Might as well leave the key next to the paper clips.
1,lame,"Worked to set the code, then to open it. Two days later it wouldnt open. I didnt change the combo. Used a metall cutter to open it, remove contents and throw safe in trash. Going to put a little more money into my next safe."
4,As advertised,"This is a very nice safe for the cost. When properly anchored, it is very secure. I am very pleased with it."
4,Holds two iPads,Easy to use. Will stop snatch and run thieves if bolted down. Bottom shelve needed to be raised or thin items are hard to get out of safe
5,Stack-On PS-514,"I've had this safe for about a month now and haven't had any issues; I did a lot of research on the best safe to store my pistols and keep them away from my teenager and the Stack-On PS-514 won; I looked another brand that was similar in spec but the operation and/or quality made the difference; the Stack-On had a much smoother knob/door operation; again, I haven't had any issues with this safe and would reccomand it to others"
3,Cheesy Safe/lockbox review,"It arrived in good condition appearing as in pictures. But the lock mechanism is a plastic flimsy mechanism employing plastic where one would want steel. Set up was easy and the directions straight forward and easy to follow. Bolted to house studs it should provide a measure of security against the random teen age house breaker not adept at picking locks. If he has that skill the safe will be hardly any delay. It appears it would take a substantial amount of pounding and smashing to get it open, but a good pry bar would pop it open in a jiffy. All in all, it will provide delay and some deterrent, but I wouldn't trust the family jewels to it."
4,Awesome pictorial layout and storytelling...,"I love the way that Ric Ergenbright tells the story of God's creation and our relationship to Him using the gift of photojournalism. He expertly draws the correlations between God's artistry and the artistry of man, Heavenly Majesty and earthly glory in a vibrant, colorful, and evocative pictorial layout.""Lift up your eyes to the heavens, and look upon the earth beneath: for the heavens shall vanish away like smoke, and the earth shall wax old like a garment, and they that dwell therein shall die in like manner: but my salvation shall be for ever, and my righteousness shall not be abolished."" - Isaiah 51:6"
1,No product Support- Stopped working,Stopped working after 9 months. Tv went dark. Do not buy! Polaroid offers no support and will not replace after 3 months.
2,Entry level info,"I was hoping for a text with more than the very basic, very repeated information in most books of this subject. If it's your first book on real estate investing, it will be great. If you're seeking more advanced subject matter, look elsewhere."
5,Some of the Best Pop Music of the 60s,"This CD contains some of the best adult, pop music of the 1960s. This music is ""adult"" in the best sense-sophisticated, subtle, and captivating. Every song here is a jewel. A young Dionne Warwick, at the dawn of her career, sings ""Don't Make Me Over"" as both a plea and a warning. Warwick perfectly captures the dream-like quality in ""(Theme From) Valley of the Dolls."" She even touches on social themes, like the Vietnam War, in ""The Windows of the World."" This CD is also packed with all of Warwick's top ten hits from the 60s-""Walk On By,"" ""Do You Know the Way to San Jose,"" and ""I Say a Little Prayer."" Next to Dusty Springfield's ""Dusty in Memphis"" these are the best female pop music recordings of the 1960s. I can unequivocally recommend this CD!"
4,Love it,Dish is very sturdy and works great. The only flaw is that it doesn't quite stay as put as I would like it to.
2,"Good, solid writing BUT.....","The story is very...icky! The hero is a rutting pig, a rapist. I like this author's writing, but I hope she's written something where the ""hero"" is not a rapist."
5,Back to A Classic,I haven't read Faulkner for forty years (my college days). It's good to return to a classic. Why did I return? Because I recently read that this is one of Stephen King's favorite authors. And I love King's work.
5,kb,Best stocking stuffer ever. I have been buying this product for years and everyone who gets one is excited about it. Good gift for male and female alike and all ages from 10 years and up.
5,The Secret Language of Birthdays,"I have had my b-day #s read once before. I ""stumbled"" onto this book while I was ""killing time"" at a school library. When I read the pages relating to my birthday; it ""nailed"" me to a tee, and it also paralleled, identically, to the reading I'd done in the past. I read the birth dates which related to my child, friends and family and the accuracy was uncanny. I'd say the accuracy would be in the range of 85% to 100% on a person's b-day. I was so impressed with the accuracy, I ordered the book. My friends and neighbors love the book and borrow it whenever they have company. It is a book that is accurate and fun!!"
5,Extremely accurate,"I read all my friends birthday and I remember going ""OMG, that's so her/him."" This book is so accurate, it's funny entertainment. It doesn't just tell you the good things about you, it's an honest book that tells who you are. And you may think it's vague, and can apply to anyone, but if you read your birthday and someone else's birthday description, you will think that the page was so right about you and your friends, and it wouldn't be right had the pages switched.There's another book like this: The Power of Birthdays, Stars & Numbers : The Complete Personology Reference Guide. Compared to that book, I would give Goldschneider 4 stars and Crawford's 5 stars. I would give this book a higher rating because it's more detailed than Goldschneider and offers more variety."
3,Secret Language of Birthdays,"I picked up this book just for fun, i generally do not believe in horoscopes or any astrological predictions. Some of the descriptions were completely and totally accurate while others where not even close."
5,best astrology book ever,This book has everything and it seems to be right on target every time. I have had many people read their birthday and even the skeptics have been intrigued by how well it described them.
5,Best Book Ever... Read Barack Obama's Birthday,"On page 352 and 353... born August 4. Interesting.......Anyway, this is now my reference for anything I want to know about a person. The Secret Language Of Relationships is just as good. Definitely get it if you don't own either already!"
4,FIFA 2002----Addicting,I have just bought this game and I play it every chance I get. It is a hard game to get used to. It is kind of hard to get the ball up the field but hey thats the fun of it. That's what soccer is. I think you should get this game even if you aren't a big fan of soccer. You will enjoy it.
5,This game is rather,"That about sums it up. This game is rather. Other FIFA games have been fun, but not as much as this one. I loved FIFA 95 for the Genesis, but this version kicks 95's patootie. I especially like the fact that you can control the keeper from anywhere on the field."
3,Try world cup instead.,"Now that EA has released their new version of FIFA featuring the world cup mode, buyiong this is knid of obsolete. There is a solid soccer game here, but it all feels very outdated. Although this is cheaper, it is not as good. Graphics are fine, but the gameplay is what saves this title. It is precise and gives you plenty of control. However, this feels a little bland. It is good, but try to pick up world cup instead."
3,Not a bad book,"As with this authors other work on Napoleon there are some mistakes, but given the sloppy level of ""scholarship"" that abounds in Napoleonic studies this work is hardly a candidate for historiological oblivion - despite the best efforts of the more hysterical and strident readers/guardians of the ""truth""The author's take on Bonaparte is realtively one-sided, but, so what? That's not a crime. Perhaps buyers of this book could place it at one end of their shelf and Alan Schom's ""biography"" at the other with the truth falling in-between? Either way, more reading is always better than less. Buy this book and enjoy it, it's not bad.A Reader"
1,Very short life in New Beetle,"When one of the bulbs in my wife's new beetle burned out I replaced both low beams with these because of past positive experiences with Hella's. Neither bulb lasted more than 6 months. I put the used Osram's (Syvania)from the high beams back in and they both lasted over two more years. These are not the Hella lights of the past. Hella has moved the production from Europe to India, and the quality has suffered. I put in 100w Hella H1's in the high beams. They continue to work, but are not used very often. If you are planning on using basic 55w bulbs, go with the Syvania's. They are made by Osram in Germany and last much longer. (Strangely not showing up on my search here, but readily available at most auto parts stores for under $8.)"
4,Heartwarming Story - Surviving a Tragedy,"I enjoyed this book and could not put it down. I liked Sean and Lily and thought their selfless acts for the children were commendable. I fell in love with the kids, even Cameron the moody teenager. The characters were nicely developed and it was great to get their perspective throughout the story. A happy ending to a tragic beginning."
2,Not all that useful,"If you have a bit of experience, I think this book is too basic. I've had the book for three weeks now, and I have found only one answer to my ""What did he say"" questions in it. The lab section is useful, however, especially since it lists normal values for many of the common tests."
5,My son loves this!!!,"My mother-in-law bought this for my son when he was a few months old. I never imagined he would love it as much as he does. When he was 3 or 4 months old it helped prop him up and he would look at it and pat it. Now, at 7 months he wrestles with it and plays with the spines on the back to hear the different noises. He loves the crinkly and shiny fabric. He tries to squeeze the nose which makes a great roaring sound. His eyes light up every time he sees dino!!!"
4,Great Service!,I ordered this book on a Friday for a class that started the following Monday and it was here first thing Monday morning. The book is in excellent condition. I would use this seller again!
2,not much help,"As another reviewer stated, subjects were scattered all over book. Constant referrals to other chapters and sections. If you choose to do the review questions in back of book, you won't find the answers unless you go on-line, very annoying as I don't like to study in front of a computer. Lastly in other science textbooks there are often mid-chapter review questions to help you learn - this had none of that. Book was useless, learned more from instructor's outlines."
2,NOT a keeper,"We used this book in our Microbiology class (community college-pre nursing). Everyone, including me, disliked this book. We usually keep all our books for future use, but concensus was to get rid of this one. We have found the topics to be scattered all over the book and not organized well. DNA replication information was not clearly explained...In fact I found most of the topics to be better explained in ""Biology"" by Cambell-Reece-Mitchell. I usually read all my books. This class, I used the web for DNA replication and bacteria caused diseases, and biology book for the rest. One good thing came out of this. It forced me to use the web, and it is a great resource for Micro."
5,The best micro book ever.,"It's a great book, the delivery was excellent and it has a very good resale price. Get it."
3,Rent before you buy!!,"I rented this game for my PS2. Its graphics were okay and its gameplay was great!! The only problem was that sometimes it is hard to see whether your shot went in the net or not. Otherwise, I think that this is a pretty cool game. I advise NBA lovers to rent this game before buying it in case they are not satisfied with it."
5,Three- Pointer!,This game is great! The graphics are amazing. They will blow you out of your seat. The game controller vibrates when you dunk or if someone hits you. The music on here is awesome. They have a nice beat. This game is way better than NBA Live 2001. I highly recommend this game for any sports gamer. (Hint: Tap the L2 button to do an alley-oop. You have to do it at the right time.)
2,Buy NBA 2K2,"I've played NBA Live ever since the beginning in 1995. EA Sports has done an excellent job with the franchise, but I must say that I'm very disappointed with this game. This game is garbage compared to what I was used to. There's no such thing as a fast break because whenever you run down court with a player, like Allen Iverson, any CPU player can catch up to you and prevent the fast break, even if they're supposed to be much slower, someone like Ben Wallace. Where's the realism in that? Other complaints are, the buttons don't react quick enough, the computer only shoots outside shots (unless it's wide open), and rebounding is impossible in the game. I wouldn't buy this if I were you. EA Sports and the NBA Live Franchise just lost a long time fan."
2,Very very disappointed,"EA Sports should be ashamed of themselves. After they hyped up the comercial the way they did I would expect much better game play. First of all the players run up and down the court at 100mph, (THAT IS INSANE)Secondly it is almost imposible to get a rebound on the defensive end. Every shot is either a bank shot or a rim shot hardly ever will you hear a swish. Besides the tattos the players look nothing like themselves. I can't wait for NBA 2K2 to be released so I can play some real b-ball. For the record I will never buy NBA Live again."
5,give the game a break all u who will like to make games prft,"i feel the game is alot like how video games should keep them,because movies aren't real so why do you expect a darn video animation to be so flawless?p.s tryouts begain jan02"
1,This is Game is whack,this game is one of the worst basketball game i have ever play...the stupidest thing about this game is that i get about 20 offensive rebounds per game and like 2 defensive rebound...that is soooooo stupid
2,Hopefully better,"Going from a dreamcast and NBA 2k1 to a PS2 and NBA Live 2001 I couldn't have been more disappointed. The graphics were horrendous, unless in replay, and the game play felt very unnatural and stiff. I hope EA does a better job this year because otherwise I'll be buying Sega's NBA game. EA is the best sports game maker in Madden, NCAA, NHL, FIFA, but right now their basketball is lacking."
3,dissappointed,I recieved this costume for my son for halloween. It arrived 10-29 and had stains on it. Since it was 2 days before halloween i did not have time to get it replaced and all the stores were sold out of spiderman so he had to wear it with the stains. Good thing he is only 2 1/2 and did not notice. If i were to order again i would not get from Amazon.
4,Cute halloween costume!,I bought this for my 1 1/2 year old. It is usually a little chilly around us at Halloween so this was great over his PJ's. Best overall looking/quality Superman costume I found.
5,My 4 year old LOVES it!,"Fits a little big, but that just gives him room to grow. Seems pretty durable and has no tears or pulls after 3 weeks of heavy wear. Hand washing is a pain, but what can you do. Muscles are stiff, but soft. My son loves it and wears it every chance he gets."
2,Cute but fit bad,The costume was very cute but fit my kid bad. The muscle chest part went up into his neck so he couldn't wear it. The rest of it fit him very well though. He immediately was pulling at the neck and wanted it off.
2,"Not bad, but not great","We bought this CD because we spend most of our time driving around in the car, and other products require that you follow along in a book. We found that some of the words were outdated (saying ""garcon"" for waiter, other books said whatever you do, don't call your waiters ""garcon""). Also, it goes a little fast, so you have to listen over and over to get stuff. In addition, rather than teaching phrases, they concentrate on single words. Some of the best things that I did before I went to France was to learn my numbers, but this tape skips over numbers as they become repetitive (30, 31, 32, 40, 41, 42), which makes it hard to follow as numbers in French are not always the easiest.Listening to it several times, though, I did pick up several words that were very useful (""billet"" for ticket came in handy many times), so it did have some benefits."
5,Tres Bien,"This product is better than I anticipated. The words spoken are clear and concise. Infinitive verbs are conjugated into all forms to help with changing the subject to past and future tense, as well as nouns.I have only been using the cd's for a couple months, and I can already pick out sentences in french instructions, email simple conversations to friend's in France, and understand some words when French is spoken in my presence.By the time I am finished grasping all cd's in another month, I should be able to hold small-talk conversations. It's a great price and very valuable for those traveling to France and would like to understand responses on directions, accomodations, and polite conversation."
4,Pretty Good,This set is pretty good. The only complaint that I have is that the time given is the same for all words and phrases and it is hard to say the longer phrases in such a short time.
3,Disjointed and difficult,"Since my wife is French Canadian, I have a great tutor to assist in learning French.I thought that this CD would help improve my skills during my daily commute, which it did, but without the help of my wife I would not have learned very much.The lessons are rather disjointed, and cover words, verbs, etc that are more travel oriented. There was little time spent in really conjugating verbs which are more useful in what I would consider everyday settings. Furthermore, there is no decomposition of some of the phrases into individual parts. Without the help of my wife in deconstructing some of the lessons, I would have not understood some of the later lessons."
4,My daughter needed a nanny - this helped,"My daughter needed a nanny. Neither of us knew anything about it. Based on the reviews, I got her this book. I haven't read it myself but years later, my daughter quotes from this book, having forgotten where it came from. She has kept her nanny, who is like a member of the family. When things don't come naturally, a good book can bridge the gap. These insights help on a daily basis. When Amazon put this title on my list of purchases, I ignored it, thinking it was a mistake. I didn't connect Mary Poppins with nanny. Because of this and the fact that I haven't read it, the book gets four stars."
3,The Man Who Saw Tomorrow,This is a very interesting movie. I seen it a couple of times and it is almost right on the dot what he has to say.
2,A Cautionary Tale ... Or Is It?,"The prophecies of Nostradamus are written in such a way that nothing definitive could be gleaned from a single interpretation, and THE MAN WHO SAW TOMORROW generously gives several interpretations to the few significant quatrains (sp?) that the prophet wrote.However, this picture was produced in a documentary fashion, using fresh footage compiled with stock footage from older films; the end result visually kept me guessing at what films they culled explosions from as opposed to being further intrigued by the prophecies.Its single redeeming quality is that it might titillate the viewer to actually go and pick up a book about Nostradamus to investigate the 'prophecies' in a more personal, meaning way.The film is narrated by Orson Welles, who (as always) gives an air of credibility to an otherwise unexplored subject matter."
3,Quality...but amazon image is misleading.,I just bought this for my daughter's birthday and it is much smaller than I thought. Also although it says it is for 12 months and up I already decided she is to young for it and I put it away in the closet.Update: My daughter is almost 13 months today and I decided to take out this toy and go sit outside on a blanket with her. At first she couldn't get the pegs in and after some trying she did it. I was so excited I threw my arms in the air. Then she put another peg in and she threw her arms up in the air. Thank-you to this toy for a precious first memory.She does try to chew them a bit so I am watching for chips based on the other reviews. I think that at this age this toy is best used under supervision. This is also because they can gag if they put the peg in their mouth.
4,A Good Introduction to Bellydance,"One of the first Videos that I bought ... easy to follow...clearly presented...good spread, quality & variety of dancers...including the well-known Fahtiem ofCalifornia."
5,"Good service, good product.",Everything I have received from this supplier has been promptly received and completely satisfactory.
2,"Low quality, high price","The light stopped working after about 6 hours of use. Tried ordering and replacing battery pack, no luck. I have had other micro lights, and the quality of this one leaves much to be desired. When it did work, it was as bright as advertised."
3,Good toy,We brought this toy about some years ago and it still works. My son does not play with it alot now but the fact that he could not break it! He used to enjoy playing with it when we first got it.
3,dictionary of Human Resources,It is Ok but some times you need in both leanguage order. Here is only in english if yo have term in Spanish if to difficult to looking the term.
2,"35 miles away, not working for me","I've read the reviews on this site and others and had high hopes for this antenna. I was using and old Radio Shack 70 mile directional running through my DISH HD receiver. The stations to the north would come in at around 80-90% on average, while the southern stations (only 20 miles away) between 55-70%.I hooked up the new antenna, aimed it using the recomended giudelines and directional charts. NONE of my northern stations came in. The highest level I could get was 63% and at that low, the signal wouldn't produce a picture. The southern stations did better coming in at 85%.So while on the roof, I reconnected my old antenna and re-aimed it to the north and now get 95-100% levels. Unfortunately I'll be returning this model."
4,Great interactive fun!,"If you're looking to learn just the basics, this is a fun way to go. It's clever and cute and has great visuals and sound. However, it probably works best if you also have a Vietnamese friend to help guide you. Also, be aware that the Vietnamese that is being taught is northern Vietnamese and not southern Vietnamese. Also, there were a few vocabulary words used which are very formal and aren't normally used by northerners or southerners."
5,What it was like to be there.,"This book is a great in-depth look at Pearl Harbor and its impact from 1941 to today.It gives the best sense of what it was like to be on Oahu from the days leading to the attack to the days following the attack, and then it compares them to the present day.I had a better sense of what Pearl harbor was like after reading this book than after all the other Pearl Harbor books I've read (and it's been quite a few) combined.If you're at all interested in Pearl Harbor, read this book."
2,Don't Bother - No Value Added,"I read two-third of the book and I feel less intelligent for it. Mr. Hoque used the letter ""e"" in front of every big word and never illustrated how ""e"" or internet would actually change the business environment. The Internet allows information to flow to almost anyone, and in a business environment, this can add tremendous value, yet, Mr. Hoque never explained or showed how this would occur. Also, his analysis on the supplier value chain was so superficial, that no value could be gained from reading that section."
3,Unlikable people but interesting story,"Set in the 1970's this short book is about a young college student named Gillian who has a painful crush on one of her professor's who makes it a habit, it seems, to seduce his young charges with his piercing eyes and fierce poetry critiques and then brings them home where his wife drugs them and they all have sex. This professor seems to enjoy breaking down these young women, first by forcing them to write out their darkest secrets for class and then by using sex and drugs. He seems a bit slimy and horribly unlikable to me but I'm not a naive 20-something coming of age in the 70's. . . This book leaves a lot to the imagination which is almost worse than spelling it out in gory detail. I enjoyed it but in the end am relieved it was only a novella because I don't think I'd want to spend any more time with these people."
2,Gothically deeply disturbing,"Deeply disturbingly Gothic in the portrayal of ""innocent"" college girls infatuated by their manipulative professor who seduces and uses them to the point of their self destruction.Set in the backdrop of a small New England college, the literal coldness of the winter frames the cruely of the professor and his wife as the young college girls happily feel honored to trek to the snow covered, pine-tree laden house of bizzare beastly happenings.This is one of Oates darker books exploring the nature of self destruction."
4,*Beasts*,"I love Joyce Carol Oates, I enjoy all her books. This is one of my lesser favorites so I gave it a three star....but I still enjoyed it. She is my favorite writer, no one else can do it like she does. I've loved all her books and intend to read everything she has to offer!"
3,It doesn't beat the heat.,"Nascar Thunder ps2 is decent. I am a Nascar freak so I had to have the very best in Nascar video entertainment. While EA's Thunder allows you to go through each of the tracks on the circuit with any driver, and does have the season capabilities, it doesn't give you the realism and quick response that Hasbro's Nascar Heat ps2. The Heat is way more challenging and allows you to tinker with the cars settings with far greater detail and consequence. The only edge that Thunder has, if this can be an edge, is that the pit crew looks more real. Anyone out there looking to spend 50 bucks on Nascar entertainment should not get the Thunder and go for the HEAT!."
2,"good graphics, poor gameplay","After renting this Nascar title and many others I have noticed that that gameplay has become harder with every new release. For a beginner racer I would suggest Nascar Heat, for medium racers the EA sports title Nascar 2001, but for somebody who needs a challenge I would say that Nascar Thunder is the right game. In Nascar 2001 the racing style is almost the same, but I was winning every race, but with Nascar thunder I was having trouble not being in last place even when holding X the whole race! I was slightly mad because the fact that if you wish to make your own racing can that it takes a very long time, many many savings numerous loadings and trouble with corperate ads on my race can. 2 stars is my review."
4,For the Serious NASCAR Fan Only,"This game is tough! It is very hard even on easy. It is designed for those fans who love NASCAR. The competitors are mean...they will run you off the track. Dealing with sponsors is also tough on you but very rewarding. The gameplay is great, same as any NASCAR game. The neat thing also is you can design your own car and race. I had a lot of fun with this option. I played this right after NASCAR Heat and expected to dominate like I do on Heat but found out thats not the case here. To be competitive you have to set your car up with such things as air pressure, etc... (unlike with NASCAR Heat) Some people find this tedious, NASCAR fans would find it fun. So I recommend this game only to those fans who are die-hard NASCAR fans, you will enjoy the game a lot."
4,Finally EA Listened,"Well, after having gone through the less than satisfying NASCAR 2001 and giving it a mediocre rating, I am pleased taht EA Sports listened and did some homework.This version of their NASCAR Franchise is a whopping 200% better than the older version.Its nice to race against a full field of cars. Its also great to see all of the current tracks including Daytona, Chicagoland and Kansas included. Now if they could figureout enough to pick up some of the cars missing from this version instead of using Busch series cars to fil out the field.Where's the 32 Tide Ride? #14 Conseco Pontiac, #71 Dave Marcis Realtree?Hey, either way you guys did much better keep up the good work!"
5,Excellent Medicine,"This stuff works so well. I use it for slight aches and it provides a temporary, soothing feeling.Additionally, it works miracles on mosquito bites. Forget afterbite (aka bleach) and use this instead. Afterbite is a waste of money and ineffective. This is actually works."
3,"Entertaining, but not as good as her other CDs","I am a fan of her children's music, but this one is a bit boring compared to her other CDs."
2,Tries too hard to be cool & misses its true audience,"Whatever happened to just simple arrangements and singing of ""classic nursery rhymes""? That's what I thought I was buying with this cd but it's not that at all. I agree with the person who said the exaggerated British accents and and other vocal and musical gymnastics make it hard for a toddler to understand. My one year old son is very smart and he laughs and claps along to his Pete Seeger cd about animals, but I don't think he'd get what was going on in these Susie Tallman songs until he was 5 years old. Which is why he doesn't really respond to the music; it's just noise. I have to sing along in my own style in order for him to get any enjoyment out of this cd and the other Tallman cd's I bought. I too purchased Tallman based on all the positive reviews; I wish that even if people were fans of her music they'd have given a more detailed and balanced viewpoint."
4,2 & 4 year olds love it!,"I just want to say, my boys have had this for almost a year and they still play with it - almost every day! It is a must have for Rescue Hero fanatics! Only problem - good luck finding the ""Mission Select"" figures that work with it! VERY hard to find! Takes up a lot of space, but my boys REALLY LOVE IT!!!!"
2,Not what was pictured.,"We received the bungee cords and the picture on the front of the canister is the same as the picture of the item on Amazon- it shows a variety of multi-colored bungee cords. The bungee cords within the package, however, are MUCH thinner and lower quality. They aren't the woven, multi-colored type. They are, in fact, the exact kind I tried to AVOID purchasing!I would recommend you keep looking."
2,cheaply made,"Really substandard bungees. very weak cord and they don't snap back like they should. the hooks are also weak, but for the price as low as it is I would say you get what you pay for."
4,A variety of sizes for a variety of tasks!,"The Buffalo 20-piece bungee set has a number of convenient sizes and lengths for just about every task. This set contains some of the lengths which I was looking for and needed, and because they were all in one set meant I did not have to purchase them separately.I deducted one star and gave it a 4-rating because the bungees are not as thick and heavy as I am accustomed to seeing bungees cords -- but they do hold and perform every bit as well."
2,Few effective parts,No amount of snappy delivery could disguise the fleeting flavor already emanating from these Brit-ster wannabes.
1,NOT WORTH THE TROUBLE,"Just as mentioned by others, this was a great product for 29 days. I turned it on and within 5 minutes the power was gone! I thought it was just bad luck until I read the other reviews. Thank goodness I can still return it for a refund. I debated whether to attempt to get it fixed under the warranty, which is good for one more day, but after reading the problems with that ($110.00) I will just return it. Too bad, it was really nice to watch TV in the kitchen while cooking."
1,Don't buy this junk,I have the same problem as all of the other people that gave reviews on this product. I had mine exactlly 5 months and 20 days and the thing died.Same thing $110.00 for a replacement with no guaranty it would last any longer.
1,JUNK!!!!!!!!!!,"Our Polaroid worked for about six months before the unit turned itself off completely. After talking with the Polaroid technical service agent, he informed us they know there is a problem and that we could buy a new power supply. However, if we bought a new power supply, the LCD screen would fry---but, we could still use the radio and CD player!!! Then, he suggested we PAY to send the unit back to Polaroid and in addition, send them $110 to replace the item. NO WAY! This thing is junk--spend the extra money for something better! If they know there is a problem, why don't they fix it? The agent also informed us the problem occurs after the 90 day warranty period. Good Luck!"
1,Junk!,My LCD went out in less than 10 months. My best freind who purchased one at the same time went out in less than 6 months! Do not buy this product - from all I have read not one has purchased one that LCD has not gone out.
1,Disgusted,"I just had to join the ranks on how disgusted I am with this product. Bought it for my new house in Dec 2005, installed it in Feb 2006 and in 30 days it died. Yes the same thing, black screen. Of course I too was past the 90 day warranty period. Now I have a $200 FM radio, no AM that never worked. It amazes me how a company can still be in business after manufacturing such inferior products. Lesson learned, never again will I buy from Poloroid."
3,It quit again,"I am writing a review..because I have had this tv since 2005..it did go out shortly after the 1st year. I always pay for extended warranty on electronics..they are worth the investment. I had bought it from Sam's..they gladly had me return it to the factory and was returned promptly and that was years ago..never had a problem til this past week. It just blanked out. I am going to order a new battery pack for it..think that is the problem. It has serviced me well, so cannot complain..did not renew the extended warranty past the 3yr one. I am not reccommending this model..but it is reasonable compared to Sony's model at twice the price. I guess I should be grateful it has lasted me this many years trouble free after the first repair."
1,LCD breaks in 8 months,"I actually really enjoyed this TV up until last week. The unit started to turn off on its own and then the LCD went black. Polaroid customer service will only give a $160 out-of-warranty exchange - I paid $300 for this unit just 8 months ago. They said they were sorry, but they cannot control the manufacturing of the product. I asked what assurances they could give that the replacement unit will not have the same problem, and he could give none. I do not recommend buying this Polaroid product."
2,"Dead, little after a year","Bought this unit at Sam's for a Christmas present 2005.In March 2007my wife went to turn it on, it made a small pop sound and all lights went off. Thought it might be the power supply, so I took it to my brother house ( They got one about a month before us, their view screen quit a couple on week before..but they still use the radio and cd player )..to make a long story short, I used their power supply on my unit..still didn't work...Looking to buy another one, but not a Polaroid, then again who know if the next is made by the same bunch. they are all junk, not made to last."
5,Magic and Meaning,"Responses to Harry Potter range from simple, uncluttered enthusiasm to pompous critiques and even outraged disdain. John Granger's book The Hidden Key to Harry Potter is a highly personal, but well-read and creatively argued case for viewing JK Rowling's work as part of the High Road tradition of symbolic Christian literature, perhaps best known in Lewis' Narnia Chronicles.The Hidden Key is a must-read for any serious Harry Potter fan, or indeed any serious reader of fiction. What I love about it is its combination of solid research and personal conviction, a rare marriage nowadays. It reads like the work of a human being who stands for something, something of which I suspect Ms Rowling, and Harry, would approve.http://bookwormclub.blogspot.com"
3,Not appropriate for younger children . .,"My husband bought this program for our 6 year old daughter who is taking a Spanish class at school. It was advertised as a children's program and the labeling was ambiguous as to what age was appropriate. Once installed, it was clearly innappropriate for younger users--full of sexually suggestive content and disturbing images (e.g. dismemebered and decapitated 'characters' in the tutorial section, cartoon-style violence, female characters with exaggerated physical characteristics, characters smooching excessively, etc.). While most older kids wouldn't be fazed by this, and might find the cartoonish violence amusing, it's not a game for a youngster. I advise parents of younger kids to look elsewhere and of older ones to preview the content and decide if it's the kind of game you want your child playing with. On the plus side, for adults and teens, the immersion-style structure of the activities seemed to be easy to use and quite instructive."
1,Eazyspeak Spanish,I'm very disappointed in this product. I'm a homeschooler who wanted her children to learn a second language. Little did I know navigating through this program you would need a computer class just to figure it out. We've had this for over a month & although we did figure out how to use it eventually I don't think the program was worth all the hassle.
4,Nice and Large,"I bought this to replace a Brita pitcher which was just not big enough for a family of 5, and this has done well so far. It is tall, so be sure it fits your fridge, and the filter takes quite a while to pass the water through, but overall I am very happy with the purchase. The water tastes good, the spigot has not dripped (yet!), and it does not eat a huge chunk of fridge space (it is pretty skinny - most of the space is vertical). I recommend this for anyone who needs more capacity than a standard pitcher can provide."
3,Well.......,"I think the product is possibly a good one for most people, but for those who want a certainty you might look elsewhere. the product worked for approximately two weeks just fine. After that its filtering slowed to a crawl until finally after leaving it to filter for over 3hrs i decided to return the product. The taste was okay...I'm sure it could work for some people but in my particular case it did not."
4,PUR 2-Stage Water Dispenser,LOVE IT! Easy to use. Sits nicely on shelf in fridge. Water tastes superb. No regrets.
2,What a mess...,"I finally threw it in the trash. When it's placed close enough to the edge of the refrigerator shelf to pour correctly, if you don't push it back farther the door shelves open the faucet and the refrigerator and freezer below it fill with water. This is the 4th time and I'm done with it. Maybe it's just a bad design for my particular refrigerator but what a mess!"
4,Great,"This water pitcher works great, the water taste awesome, and its very practical, i can easily got good water at a low price"
3,Convenient but slow. No gauge despite description.,"It is pretty convenient device and it works for me. Sure I can't judge the quality of filtering. Initially it filtered suficiently fast. But after a week or two the speed of filtering noticeably declined. Can take few hours to process half a gallon a so. It is not a problem of the dispenser itself but rather its filter. Since this is still the first filter that came with dispenser, I don't know whether it is defect of this particular filter or it is the problem by design.Product description clearly states that dispenser has a gauge: ""A handy gauge indicates when the filter needs to be replaced"". To the contrary, there is no any gauge on the dispenser and anywhere else. There is a round sticker attachable to any flat surfice with a sticky indicator that you manually move after each filter replacement. Since it was one of the reasons for buying this dispenser I find it misleading to say at least."
5,Still pleased with this after 4 years,"I bought this in 2008 and have used it continuously since then and have no complaints about its performance. The water tastes just fine, certainly an improvement on our tap water taste. We have very hard water here, but I notice little difference in the filter performance even towards the end of the recommended usage period. I confess I do not change it as often as recommended, probably because I don't notice much reduction in its performance.Easy to clean and I've never seen any mineral deposits in the main reservoir (occasionally some faint, easily washed-away deposit in the top), so I guess the filter is doing its job. I'm looking at buying a small 1-gal. humidifier that recommends using filtered water for hard water areas and I'm going to try using my PUR-filtered water."
5,Saves $$,"Was spending $80.00 to 100.00 per month on bottled water. Tap water where we are is the pits. This device works well, the water tastes great, and it saves a ton of cash. Had no problems with it at all. You can't go wrong with the price of it and the filters. Say goodbye to bottled water!"
1,lasted 6 days,"1st filter that came with the unit lasted only 6 days ! I am using it to remove bad taste from already filtered water that comes out of my sink, so how can the filter last 6 days, approx 10 gallons? Absolutely ridiculous !"
2,Doesn't filter water properly/effeciently,"Length:: 1:19 MinsBasically we are on our 4th filter with the same problems. It works fine for about 10 days to 2 weeks or so. Then the water just stays in the top part and doesn't filter. The video explains it further. We are going to go with the Brita now, which is what I should have done prior. I guess you pay for what you get."
3,Filter life/speed,"I see a lot of complaints about filters needing replacing often, or how slow they filter the water. It should be clear that if your filter doing a good job, then water going thru it is going to be slow, and you may have to change the filter regularly if it gets clogged up with everything it's taking out of your water."
4,Awesome!,"I really love the PUR 18 cup dispenser. It fits nicely in the fridge and is a great replacement for all of those plastic bottles that I have wasted in the past. I have tried the pitchers before and just find them annoying, I have also had the PUR faucet filter which cracks in a few months. So this works perfectly. The only complaint I have is when it arrived the lid had a slight crack in it. I called the company just to see if they would send me a replacement lid and they said they could not. Instead she was supposed to send me a coupon for a whole new dispenser which I have yet to receive. But I have decided that it really isn't that big of a deal, just a slight annoyance."
4,Wish it was a little bigger,"I love this product, but I wish it was a little bigger since I have to keep refilling it for my family of 4"
1,"Only worked with the original filter, useless now","I bought this a year ago in May 2011, loved it. Worked great, took about 5 minutes to filter all the water on the top. Since I use it sparingly I usually fill it up once a day(I'm rarely home.) The original filter lasted about 10 months,it became slow since March 2012 so bought a new replacement filter from Wal-mart. This one lasted about a month and the water doesn't filter down any more!!! I searched online to see if anyone else has this problem and found a large group of customers complaining about the replacement filters, bought from various sources. The pitcher itself is great but the faulty or useless replacement filters render this product unusable. I expect to be able to use the pitcher at least a couple of years for the price I paid. Not worth it as long as replacement filters are the problem. Do yourself a favor and look else where. In case you find something let me know so I can buy a more reliable product with a bettet life expectancy."
4,Better the Britta,"I bought this because we needed a good water purifier for the fridge. It fits very well, being skinny, and hold a good ammount of water. I like it better than the Britta dispense, its designed better and looks so much better in the fridge. I recommend this product."
2,Ridiculously slow.,"As my title states. This filter is ridiculously slow.Half a glass of water per 45 minutes, roughly.The only useful purpose would be filling it up the night before, for maybe 3-4 glasses of water by the afternoon.I don't know about its filtering abilities, but they seem decent enough.Pathetic.I would never buy again, and probably won't buy a PUR again."
4,Great filter!,"I really like this water dispenser. I used to use a Brita pitcher but even after I changed the filter it wasn't tasting right so I wanted to switch. Really glad I went with the Pur brand. Great taste. Fits well in fridge. I would only wish there was something you could take out and fill instead of taking the whole thing out of the fridge to refill. Unless there is a way, I just don't understand ha."
5,Great Water Purifiers of Justice!,"Just had to speak up and give it five stars. This little puppy makes nasty tap water taste like fresh, crisp, bottled water. So thrilled to leave bottled water off my grocery list, plus great for the environment. Win win! :)"
4,satisfied customer,"Delivered as promised, performs as advertised, would recomend to anyone looking for this type of uinit.Steve"
4,very good product.,"i wish there was a filter life indicator like the pitcher version has, but it is a great pitcher. working great so far!"
5,Excellent product!!,Our family has enjoyed this PUR water dispenser greatly. We fill it several times a day and it has taken the chlorine taste out of our water. It fits nicely in the fridge and my kids drink way more water because they love using the little spout to get the water out! I think it is definitely worth the money because we were spending lots each week on bottled water! Enjoy!
5,Pur Water Dispenser,This is the first review I've written for any product on Amazon. The Pur Water Dispenser is well constructed and easy to use. It's size and shape are well suited for use in my refridgerator. The filter is easier to install than I had anticipated. The water is crisp and good tasting. I give it five stars.
2,Pur Problem,"Others have noted an apparent quality control problem with the replacement filters. After a short while, well before the filter is due for replacement, the water takes hours if not days to drain through from top to bottom. It seems to be an issue with the activated carbon in the filter, which appears to break down and block the outlets. Shaking the filter restores operation but only temporarily. Too bad, because this was a good product. However, the filter problem renders it useless. I would recommend trying a different manufacturer."
2,Ok for price,Does not change taste of water. I really do not know whether it does the intended job. There is no such indicator that the cartridge filter works fine and it is good to use. I would not recommend this product
3,nice... except filters only last one month,"i like this product - nice and solid, works as designed (admittedly, there's not much to it) and the water tastes fine.one drawback: the filters have only functioned adequately for around one month, after which the filtering process slows to an impractical rate. we may have especially nasty water (Brooklyn, NY... it doesn't taste good), but we've only got two people drinking off the thing. just a heads up."
5,Thank you Amazon,these books are so rare and I was thrilled to find one on Amazon. The Dealer sent it almost immediately and it arrived in great condition. If anyone has any of these I am interested in purchasing them. wish I could find the very first edition. Thank you Amazon for such great vendors.
3,"Underwhelming, But Never Boring","""The Good Guys"" is a flawed, but entertaining story written by retired undercover FBI Agent Joe Pistone and coauthor Bonanno, former head of a well-known New York crime family. Pistone, better known by his alias Donnie Brasco, runs into Bonanno during the investigation of a fuel-oil scam supposedly operated by the Russian mafia. Overall, this book based on real events that make it believable, but not essential."
1,"They may know the Mafia, but they don't know fuel!","They novel is a pleasant quick read, a little repitious in places to be sure due to switching narrators, but that is fine. What ruins the book is that the entire premise of the Russian organization's scheme is flawed by the authors' lack of knowledge of what home heating oil really is. They think that it is gasoline. What a shame!"
2,Made me upset!,"If you are prepared to tell your kids that the Easter Bunny is not real, this would be the book for you, if not DON'T buy this one!I purchased this book and read to my 6 year old daughter tonight. All was going well, it told the story of Jesus and the resurrection and how eggs were given as a sign of new life. Then it moved on to tell about Easter celebrations now with the colorful eggs and baskets. Then it goes on and tells how the ""legend"" of the Easter Bunny came about. I was floored! Reading the story tonight I was not prepared to tell my daughter that the Easter Bunny is not real. I know it would happen some day in the future but not from a childs Easter story at age 6. I'm lucky my 4 year old wasn't in the room while I read this to her!"
3,Not the best LP set,"We got this for our 2 year old, and she has already lost interest. She does like making the car go down the track and hearing the noise. But, the music doesn't play when we spin the ride and the track comes apart fairly easily. She MUCH prefers her LP farm and the school bus. I would recommend skipping this set and opting for one of the others..."
5,AWESOME Toy!!!!,"I picked this toy up at a clearance sale at Kmart and my 21 mos. son just loves it. He played with it for two hours as soon as I took it out of the box and put it together, and probably would have kept going if he hadn't had to eat something!He can't get enough of this, it holds his attention better than television. I am so impressed!!! I loved little people when I was small, and my sisters and I would play with our farm and Jet plane for hours on end, too. I am so glad to see my son enjoying them sooo much!I saw another review that said the assembly was difficult, and I just have to say thats not true. If I can put it together without frustration then, just about anyone can in my opinion, because I am not handy at all!! I usually leave the assembly to my husband."
4,Easy Beginning Bread Baking,"Believe me if you are a beginner bread baker, throw away the bread machine and start using your own fingers and hands. This book should be published once again, and put right back on the shelves. Recipes are clear to understand and prepare. The ingredients are common staples you would find on your kitchen shelves. There are no complicated breads to bake. Most important, the breads you bake are delicious. Such a small book, but such an abundance of goodness."
2,Where's the REAL Mystery Here?,"I was amazed to learn that foals ""are born blind, and it generally takes two days for their eyesight to develop fully."" (Dark Horse, page 122). I have bred and foaled out both Arabians and Thoroughbreds, and never (ever) had a ""blind"" foal. Interesting. Maybe I just failed to notice the poor things running into walls and trees. With a serious inaccuracy such as this, one must take this entire book with a grain of salt!There are numerous editing errors that ultimately detract from the narrative. A disappointment overall."
1,do not purchase this product,"we purchased this product on 4/16/08 for $314.99 at Best Buy.on 10/01/09 it died.the tv will not turn on, no picture, no sound, no blue button, no power, no nothing.dead.one and a half years old?????google ""westinghouse 19"" LCD HDTV problems"" and see for yourself that this product is horrible waste of money and plastic.for the 17 months it did ""work"" the sound was sub par. awful."
4,Great Video and Audio Quality,"Please describe the audio and video quality of any Blu-Ray you review. Thanks to those who do this.The video was excellent, but more vivid than most Blu-Ray movies. I usually watch movies with my TV picture set to ""Vivid"", but with this movie, I changed it to ""Standard"". 2.40:1.The DTS-HD Master 5.1 audio was about the best surround sound I've ever heard.The movie was very bloody and gory, and pretty realistic looking. Some nudity."
3,Priannah 3d Sucks!,Priannah 3d could of been way better it was really gross ! blood eww! I saw it beacause of Vannessa from gossip girl she did great she was the best girl on there. I think she survived right? So I gave it a 3 for at least it was entertaining but very creeped out after I was done watching.I seriously felt those things on me lol! I mean thats so not right thats just plain disturbing! This is so not jaws and if they want to make it right ask jaws for adivce they will tell you what to do lol!
3,OK film,"I'm not gonna go into great detail bout this movie. I've not seen the original film, but did find this one OK to watch. I loved seeing Christopher Lloyd. I also liked the special effects even tho alot of times you could really tell that the Piranha's were computer generated. All in all give it a watch like I did."
4,good 3d effects,This is a B grade film but a good B grade film and the 3D effects makes it a grade B plus film.
2,Poor B Movie,"I bought this movie to use on my new 3D tv --- currently, there is a shortage of movies (good or bad ones) in 3D. This movie would have been a rather poor Saturday Afternoon B Movie. The only redeeming factor is the decent 3D effects in the movie. I would not recommend this movie for anything other than the 3D effects."
2,many ghosting on this one!,"i own the UK (not from sony) 3D blu ray and must say that this 3D blu ray title suffers from many ghosting problems, right from the beginning with the dimension logo, i have the brand new full HD 3D pojector from JVC (X3) and on many films like AVATAR or ALICE ON WONDERLAND have none ghosting effects at all, i think the US 3D blu ray from sony has the same problems, now i live in germany and will hope the canadian or the french or the german 3D blu ray is well produced and it will hopefully ghostingfree 3D blu ray as it sould be."
1,"""Why don't you be a girl and sunbathe or somethin?""","Sub-par script that delights in the dismemberment of females; for every male torn apart by piranha, ten females meet the same fate, and the females' fates are more graphic and freakish to boot."
2,Not that good.,"I was kinda disappointed with this. I knew it wasn't going to be a serious film or anything, but it just wasn't a whole lot of fun. There are a few cool moments, but overall its a bit boring and besides some very hot naked girls doesn't offer very much. Everything seemed to be there to deliver a fun ride, but for some reason it just stalled."
2,WTF was this?,"All I can say is this was one of the worst movies I have ever seen. The 3D effects were great, but the movie itself sucked big time. As a true Piranha fan this movie was disrespectful at best. I mean come on people..."
2,decent,"Shipping was fast, but the product was not received as specified in the original order. If you are looking for a crappy sci-fi that has an unbearably bad plot with girls in skimpy clothing, this is for you."
1,There is 2D movie in 3D Bluray disc,"Ha ha ha ha....not even a single effect which makes you feel like something is coming out of screen, yes i do have good 3D setup. 0 Star"
1,Great Idea but Bad movie,Perfect nude womengreat spring break placeworst acting ever..wish shue had not done thisdirector who had to be an idiot..never tied up loose endsunfinished plotscan't hold attentionnot even syfy qualitywaste of money to buy try Wyvern from syfy or Sea Beast as both had plotnot perfect movies but better than time to look at the movie box from this one3D implant scene only good part and that will not hold up rest
1,What the ?????,"I saw the first Piranha (1978) and appreciated director Roger Corman's camp. It's a serious movie that doesn't take itself too seriously. I get it.Now the remake. I don't get it. Serious camp or parody? Elizabeth Shue (badly miscast) plays the part as serious as Roy Scheider in Jaws. She never lets on that she knows she's in a horrible film and I am not quite sure she gets it either. While on the other hand, Jerry O'Connell is so over-the-top that you know he is laughing between scenes.Overall a bad B movie. Shame. If Roger Corman had been involved, could have been campy summer fun!"
1,Switch your brain off for this rubbish,"Utter garbage. The film is laughable and forgettable. Bad story, bad acting and there are so many flaws in the plot that it's not even worth going over them. Also - over the top sex and nudity scenes throughout, definitely NOT for family viewing, at times it feels like a soft core porn movie. Perhaps the scariest aspect of this movie is the fact that it was shown in cinemas worldwide, rather than straight to DVD, then tossed in your local dollar store, where it would fit in quite perfectly with all the other trashy DVDs. I imagine the movie will appeal to the type of audience who are used to watching movies with their brains on standby mode, or switched off completely. If so, then this movie will suit you, as there is not much to it."
5,Just in Time,The lab coat made it exactly on time.. fit perfectly..if i needed another lab coat i would defenitely buy backfrom this seller
2,Power supplies burned out,"I bought two of these in the summer of 2002. One died a month ago; the second one died today. Both of them had burned-out AC adapters. This is just not acceptable; devices should last more than 18 months.I would give it 1 star, except that I was so pleased with it when I got it; it was such a joy to have a switch that didn't care if I was using a crossover cable or not, and would connect to other switches as easily as to hosts. These days, though, that's a fairly common feature."
5,On tour with radiohead,"I first saw the great music video for Dark Wave on Subterranean, the MTV2 indie rock show. I wasn't for sure if I would like the whole cd though. Then I found out they were going to open for Radiohead (all hail Radiohead) and I decided to pick up the cd. After listening to it once, I wasn't completely sure it would stick with me. However, it grows on you, and now I enjoy it almost as much as Radiohead's latest, Hail to the Thief. (You can never beat them.)This is a really great cd if you are patient and you give it time. You will grow to love it alot.Also, is it just me or does this remind listeners of Radiohead at times and Tool at times. I may be way off track, but that's just me."
3,"C'Mon, Stephen!","It's like Roger Waters without Pink Floyd. Or Robert Plant without Led Zep.Stephen is talented, but his talent came through with Pavement. Period.I am sorry that you had a lover's spat, Steve. GET OVER IT!I just hope that Steve will pull his over-inflated head out of his booooty and realize that the grass was greener WITH pavement.Gee, Steve... I am sorry you had a 'disagreement' with the band. Boo freakin' Hoo.That band MADE you.Show the fans (who pay YOUR bills) some respect and do the 'reunion' thing. And I don't mean the ""Led Zep"" reunion with one or two shows. I mean a full-blown tour. Hey, if you need to bring your 'other' band along, charge us another $5 per ticket. We'll do it & more. Just don't be a doofus! We love Pavement.The Jicks? Jix?Whatever. We know it's a solo project. BOOOORING!"
2,Basic,"The information in the book are basic, not deeply developed. Maybe it is good for beginners, not for experienced personnel."
1,FALSE DESCRIPTION - BE AWARE!,"I'm writing this review to clear up the inaccuracies in Amazon's description (and most descriptions around the web).Amazon's description says: ""The CA-PS400 can charge up to two batteries simultaneously...A full charge (from completely flat) takes about 90 minutes.""This is inaccurate. Take a look at the product in the picture, you'll probably think this unit is capable of charging 2 batteries at the same time. Unfortunately it can't. It can only do one at a time. It charges batteries ""sequentially"" - there is nothing ""simultaneous"" about it.At B&H;'s website you can find a complete description of this product that includes the following:""Note: The Charger will only charge one battery at a time.""So please be aware what you're buying here - a charger that holds 2 batteries but charges them one at a time."
3,Another Guthrie for the ages,"As the daughter of legendary Arlo Guthrie you would expect the storytelling to be great, but remember this album is a joint collaboration between Sarah and her husband Jeremy Irons who wrote most of the album. Although the storytelling is not up to par with Arlo's, the musicianship on this album makes it one to grasp onto and listen to, at first I didn't grasp the subtle influences that flowed within the songs but something always brought me back to this album and with mixed emotions I listened to it again and found myself lost within the harmonies on it. This album has found a place in the rotation of the music I enjoy, and with that I give it three stars for being an album that somehow mystifies me and haunts me with the knowledge of what can become one of the great husband/wife teams in music."
2,Don't bother if you want the 'fountain pen' look,"These pens have a ball at the tip (the nib), so you'll never get those slants or expressions. If you want that fountain pen look, but not the functionality, these will work for you."
3,Ink bleeds through,"I decided to try the disposable fountain pen because I wouldn't have to buy refills and it is a great price compared to other pens. Also I wouldn't feel guilty for misplacing one of these. At first I thought they were great, they write smoothly and quickly, but when I tried to write in a notebook I realized that the ink was bleeding through to the next page making double sided writing impossible and the next page of my notebook covered with dots. The ink also spreads slightly so the line will be a bit thicker than you intended making fine writing and small script difficult. However, if you want to try the feel of a fountain pen before making the switch up, these are a good get your feet wet for how it feels to try a fountain pen. There is also much more ink in one disposable pen than in a single ink cartridge refill of a standard fountain pen. Just realize that an upgrade to an inexpensive fountain pen that takes refills will be an even better experience."
4,Good pen. Wirth your money,"These are great pens for the low price. They write well and fast, but can only make 1 type of line. Do not get these for calligraphy. If you have no experience with fountain pens these will get you used to the way you have to hold them. These are great for writing notes or general purpose writing. Anything important or more permanent should be taken care of with a more permanent pen."
1,Not That Great,"These pens may look like calligraphy pens, but don't let the fancy nib confuse you. They write like normal pens with no control over the width of your marks. The ink also has the tendency to get all over your hands and it's not easy to get off. Also bleeds through many different types of paper we've tried it on."
5,"Oh, wow.","These are easily the most awesome bargain-priced fountain pens I've ever used. Smooth writing with that pretty little sound that fountain nibs make as you write, and beautiful vivid ink colors -- truly a multi-sensory experience :) It's hard to believe these are less than a buck a pen, they don't feel that cheap at all.Someday maybe I'll splurge on a real, expensive fountain pen, because there's nothing like writing on good paper with a nice metal nib -- but if that someday never comes, I'll be happy with these."
1,Low Score for false advertisement,"I'm a huge fan of calligraphy and fountain pens, I love the way they write and there's nothing quite like writing with a fountain pen. With that said these are a huge disappointment. I saw tons of very positive reviews and the price and color and figured I couldn't go wrong. I'm shocked that none of the reviews I read mentioned the elephant in the pen design which is these are not fountain pens! If you look very closely to the end of the nib you will see a small ball, which makes these ballpoint pens. I wrote with them over and over trying to figure out why they didn't write like my fountain pens and after close inspection I noticed this. Now these are great pens if you want colorful, gel, ballpoint pens. However, if you want a fountain pen I recommend you not buy these...I actually feel quite ripped off but you get what you pay for."
3,Not *quite* right,"This pillow is too fat around the center. I'm looking for a cotton batting fill, that is narrower.It's better than a squashed up, old bed pillow.."
3,Just ok,"The middle circumference is too large and does not support my neck very well... at least not as well as those ""U"" shaped pillows you get at travel stores. I wish the middle ""cylindrical"" part was smaller. I am just not comfortable with this pillow. The middle is also too soft and is another reason why it does not support my neck well. On the other hand, I love the color, it is really cute. But I really needed it for my neck, not my decor."
5,Awesome,"Bought these for everyone in my family for our long plane ride to Hawaii. My 8yr, 10y kids plus my husband and I all loved them. Easy to get comfortable in an airplane seat. Very bulky for carry on but well worth the trouble. Washed up very nice as well."
5,Great buy!,"I brought this pillow for a 3-hr driving trip. I never liked driving trip because I cannot relax on the car ride. I used this pillow at home before the trip but it wasn't really comfortable. I sort of regretted for purchasing it.I was wrong the pillow was great for a trip! I slept like a baby in the car. The bone shape perfectly fits on the neck and head. Now I keep the pillow in the car, so I can use it anytime. Highly recommended pillow."
4,Great support,Just received this pillow today and have been using it all night. It supports my head perfectly for couch sitting. It feels very firm like it will not lose its shape. I only wish the outside was of a softer material like cotton so it would feel more comfortable against my cheek.
3,Too large,I gave this 3 stars because I love the colors - it looks much nicer in person. I purchased this to use as a neck rest while sitting up in a recliner - but it's at least twice as wide as it should be for that. If I were using it to sleep flat to get neck support - that may be ok...but definitely too large for sitting up. I've been trying to twist it to make it smaller - that helps a little. I'm still keeping it and will continue to work at batting down the stuffing to get it to be the right size.
3,Worked at first,"But I think my neck and shoulder problems are too much for this pillow to handle. It also wasn't comfortable (to me) unless I was sleeping on my back. It was handy to take on the airplane, tho."
5,"A life in jazz, in the words of those who lived it","This one-of-a-kind oral history makes fascinating reading. It's full of anecdotes and innuendo, cameraderie and competition, in the words of the musicians themselves. The intent of Gitler's book is to document the shift in the 1940s away from the popular form of swing jazz to the more complex, more personal bop style. The stories of life on the road, the ""cutting contests"" of musicians trying to outdo one another off the bandstand, and the personal stories of struggle and discrimination, bring the era to life in a way that no scholarly book can match. Most of the great musicians are here, and it's fun to read them jostling about on the page trying to set the record straight, according to their lights. Maybe not the best first book on jazz, but if you're already a fan this should definitely be your next one."
2,CD by a Drummer that's not a Drummer's CD,"On the upside the recording was executed beautifully. Very rich quality with tremendous depth. On the downside however, the songs were not interesting to me. I've seen Anton play and he has so much more to offer as a player than is conveyed here. Most of these tunes are slow to moderate tempo with no explosive quality. The effort reminds me of what Narada Michael Walden did in the 70s and 80s. A world class player delivers popish, moderately hip compositions that don't showcase the players' talents. The problem is that as pop tunes, these don't stand up and they aren't saved by great instrumental performances. Admittedly, I have a preconception that in the tradition of Buddy Rich, Billy Cobham, Lenny White, Omar Hakim, etc., recordings released by great drummers, ought to have standout drum performances. Anton is great, you should see him live."
2,Dropped the Ball,"I can't see how reviews for this game are so good. It has several obvious flaws as detailed in other reviews. I just want to add my voice to that.In particular I'm pissed at the fact that I can't have more people in a single game. The only reason this game gets a 3/5 stars for fun is because of the LAN party potential, but they've even stunted that. 4 players, on down to 2 if you have a couple of bots with each player. Sorry, what happened to having 8?... at least.Graphics look great, but I would love to be able to see what the heck I'm doing, and holding down the right click button to attack? Are you kidding me?Sorry, but this is not a good follow up to the DS I used to know and love. I wouldn't waste your money on this title."
4,Second Dungeon Siege Continues Good Start,"Excellent game mechanics, combat, magic, and quest schemes. Limitation on party size during first pass through the game (Player plus no more than 3 NPC's, vs. the 5 NPC party members allowed during the THIRD runthrough) is frustrating, as is the savegame approach which requires you to get back to a city before closing the game down (unless you want to hike back to wherever you were...you always start a game session in the nearest city)."
3,Does the job...,"I bought this sharpener for my classroom because the box said it was powerful and quiet, and it sold for around $30 in the office store where I got it (but it was on sale for $20.) It is powerful, but it isn't at all quiet. You have to hold on tightly to the pencil, because the sharpener tries to turn it in your hand. It has suction cups on the bottom that hold it really stable, which is a plus. Overall, though, my $10 sharpener that I've had for years is quieter and just as able to to the job, except that it's too dull to use now. This one does the job, but it's not fun to use. I wouldn't recommend it if you're looking for smooth handling and a quiet ride."
2,bad sharpener,"I bought and returned this sharpener. This sharpener was worse than some battery operated sharpeners that I bought. It gnaws the pencil more than sharpens it, and it appears to be straining through every bit of it. The wood around the point looked fuzzy after it was sharpened."
4,Too bad it's a little too simplified,"My main complaint about this train set is that the engines don't reverse. You can only go forward or stop, and there is no variation in speed. The other thing is, so many things come with this beginner set--too many for a first time user. I would rather have had a simpler starter set and added the features my son would really like.All that being said, my four year old loves this set and plays wtih it every day--he's had it for eight months, too."
4,Tons of Fun and a little glue,"My son recieved the GeoTrax for Chritmas and he loves it. Everyone got together for his birthday, only a matter of days later, and purchased all of the accesories and him and I sat down and put it together. The more pieces that we had with the fire house, construction site and add on tracks the more complicated it was to put together so that everything would flow on one conjoined track - however we looked at it as a puzzle. The only problem that we came across was that the bridge would not stay together, rather than fight needlessly with it, and eventually say that part just wouldn't go there, i pulled out a bottle of superglue and glued it together - problem solved. And he loves every min. of his train, bridge included."
4,Lots of Fun,My son loves this toy. I did NOT have a problem with sounds or tracks not fitting. It works wonderfully and is great play for my 3 year old. Every holiday he gets more accessories for it. The other engines come with more track pieces to make it larger. It is durable and interactive. I love it and would recommend it for anyone!
2,Disappointed,"I bought this for my 3 1/2 year old for Christmas (also for his 6 y.o. brother to share) and I must say I am pretty disappointed. After reading so many good reviews I really had my hopes up that this would be money well-spent but unfortunately not. My main complaint is that the accessories (firestation, farm, gravel loader etc.) don't stay attached to the track and the whole thing just ends up being a big mess. Also, the accessories are really pretty boring as they don't really do that much (the gravel loader doesn't load anything, the other accessories load very small pieces that are easily lost). In the end, this has not been played with very much since Christmas day and I envision it soon being dumped into a tub for a once-in-while rainy day activity. With having bought the main track and most of the accessories I do feel this was a waste of money."
1,Don't do it!,"Although this is a really sleek looking unit, it sounds awful. The speakers point downwards, the sound is tinny, and it doesn't get loud enough to compensate for regular kitchen noises. The screen is a nice size but is hard to see unless its angled just so. I am returning it and plan to try Sony's unit which is a little more expensive, but hopefully will look and sound better."
1,DO NOT BUY THIS,I bought one of these for my wife for Christmas. 9 months later the screen burned out. What a piece of junk. STAY AWAY!
5,Great Unit!!,"We use this unit everyday...before work, and after work when we're cooking dinner. Sometimes we don't even get out of the kitchen!! (we need to get a life!):-)"
1,BAAAAAAAAFFFFF!!!,I tried to get into this album three times and not once did I find a song that I liked. Its just to bland and unoriginal for me.
1,Unlistenable Noise,"There really ought to be a No Stars rating.This record bites, probably the worst record I've bought this year (at least I hope I don't buy worse). Pretentious, tedious junk, without a single original note in it."
4,Mann,"Hey ,well I'm been listening to some new bands, and well Cursive is pretty good. Probably pretty soon they'll be up with my favorites, because I find myself wanting to listen to them more and more."
4,Spiteful and Beautiful,I really liked this one. It can be a little ugly at times and can send you soaring moments later. You can tell that there was a lot of feeling put into the work. Just don't make the mistake of skipping through it the first time you listen to it.
2,It's plastic!,"I read the technical details of this wall sconce:White rust-resistant wall sconce ideal for waterside use...Hardware uses non-corrosive nylon and stainless steel...When I received it, it was all plastic. I returned the pair.Was not impressed for my application, but, if you are truelylooking for rust-resistant, this completely plastic fixturewill fit the bill."
3,Good little toy,This is a cute little toy. We hope to collect the whole amusement park set. We still have the FP little people toys from our childhood in the 70's. They keep the child's attention and spark creativity. Only downside - no off switch for music/sound.
4,Cute,its cute and fun to spin the wheel around and it has music that you can opt to turn off if its driving you crazy which is a good feature.
3,Great concept --- poorly executed,"Very frustrating toy for my two-year-old twin grandaughters. My own children loved the vintage Fisher Price ferris wheel so I thought this would be fun. They do like spinning the people around, but somebody at Fisher Price forgot to ask little ones to try putting the people in their seats when testing this product. You need one hand to stop the ferris wheel from turning, one to stop the seat from swinging, and another to push (with pressure needed) the character into the seat. Hmmm... seems like 3 hands are needed when you are little. Oh well, I guess that's what grandma is for."
4,Very good and pratical advice.,"The book provides a way to look at the sales process. A more conceptual approach is taken and I found the book very usefull. I took away a few of the points that help me deal with clients, prospects and myself frequently.I learned more from this book than most of the $200-400 corporate classes thatI have attended over the last few years.Selling is not about you! It is ALL about the buyer!!Do yourself a favor, read and study a book referenced in this book, How To Win Friends & Influence People."
2,It just didn't work as well as other similar products i have used,"I was trying to fasten together a clean break in a porcelain bowl. I followed the instructions, and it did hold the pieces together, but the bond was not strong and they separated a few days later. I made a similar repair on a similar bowl with a different product about 8 months ago, and that bowl still holds together perfectly even after multiple uses and multiple cycles in the dishwasher. Now, if only I could remember which product I used last time..."
5,Excellent,"I don't speak a good english enough to express my feeling about this album. That's really really good music. RJD2's beats are dope and the voice of blueprint is the perfect addition. In fact, this album may be strange at firt listening but when you really discover it, it is a masterpiece.Best tracks:Just thinkJerry springer episodePrintmaticRight place wrong timeI also bought the instrumental version in vinyl and it's really good too."
1,A disappointing horror experience,"I really wanted to enjoy this book, since I'm on the hunt for a new-to-me horror novelist that I can enjoy. This was my second read by Little (first was ""The Walking"") and likely my last. In ""The Town,"" Gregory and Julia Tomasov win the lottery and return to the small town of Gregory's childhood along with his mother and their 3 kids. They forget the traditional/religious invitation to the spirit that will supposedly keep any house safe, but nobody except Gregory's mom takes it seriously. Not surprisingly, horror ensues, or some strange imitation of horror.This book features weak characterization, a dull dragging plot, a few moments that you know should be really gripping but just aren't, and to top it all off perfectly - lots of typos. There were some unique horror moments which were fascinating in their weirdness, but they didn't come close to making up for the *horror* of this reading experience."
3,"OK book, but not solid.","When you read the first couple of chapters, the book takes on the boring old tradition of meeting the characters. Then it takes a turn and actually gets interesting, but then slacks off again. I was disappointed with the ending, but it wasn't so bad that it was totally unreadable. For fans of Little, I suggest trying out Ronald Kelly."
2,Little - The Town,"A year or so ago, I picked up Little's The Association on a whim and I truly enjoyed it. Since then, I've experienced good and bad sides of Bentley Little. Little is truly talented - he has a gifted imagination and a laid back style of writing. There are usually a few good scares and some genuinely humorous moments in all his novels. Unfortunately, The Town is not one of his better efforts.The Town is quite simply not well written or well executed. Dialog is just plain dumb, ideas and plot lines are muddled and the book is just not that scary. And while the source of the evil is kind of interesting, it really just sounds silly by the end of the novel.Little's written better novels - try The Association or The Store before wandering through the pot-holed, badly mapped streets of The Town."
2,Better out there from ChameleonsUK,"I'm a huge fan of the Chameleons UK and saw them in the late 80's. They're incredible! I was pleased to see that they were back at it again. This cd is nice from the standpoint that it was great to hear them play, but the disc is mellower and tamer than their previous works. If this is your first intro to the band it may disappoint. Script of the Bridge is a much better intro to the boys. This disc had some soft spots that just made me feel like the I was getting old(I already get that feeling enopugh). The reworking of ""Swamp Thing"" just makes you yearn for the original. Some of Mark's vocals just seem too coffee-house and the power guitars are sadly missing. The lyrics and songs are all quite pleasant."
2,Nice looking but broke,"This was really nice looking, made a great gift. Unfortunately it broke after a couple months of moderate use. First the detaching part started getting stuck, hard to detach, then it eventually broke off. Ended up replacing it with a simpler valet keychain that was half the price for two, just in case one broke (which hasn't happened yet). I would not buy this particular product again unless I just wanted to hang it up on the wall to look at the emblem."
3,"Jeeze. . . . .who put this together .. . . . .South Parks ""Timmmy !!!""","Cartman: "" Timmy that's not how you put the wings and landing gear on a Colonial Viper!!""Timmy: ""Timmy ??""Cartman: ""Timmy you stupid #$%^@# @#$% gimme that Colonial Viper and let a for real full fledge literate BSG Fan attach those wings and landing gear correctly !!!""Timmy: ""TIMMMYYY !!!""Cartman: ""Mooom Timmy won't give me his Viper !!!"" That's a bad Timmy !!!Timmy: . . . . . . . .Tim-mmmy ???"
5,"Rejoice, Ye Geek Children Of the 1970s","For those of us who are aging nerdy children of that golden era of the 1970s and 80s, this is the perfect item for a little of that disposable income. Totally geektastic. I've got a few Vipers hanging from the ceiling of my one-year old son's room, another above the fireplace, and a few for playing with. Never can have too many Vipers to fend off the occasional pesky Cylon home invasion.Why quibble over quality? It's a piece of injection-molded plastic, made from petroluem by-products and releasing deadly carbon into our atmosphere in the process of its construction. As a cheap toy it is par excellence, a modern relic of this brief shiny period in human history when such things are mass-produced and cheaply available.It is fun. Buy one. It even looks cool with the wings on backward, as in the display photo.So say we all!"
4,digest it!,"well all it takes is an open mind AND an appreciation for the real classics. first off let me note that you have to forget about the ramitdownthethroat classics that you've been force fed all these years on so called classic radio. these remakes go beyond what you are soooo used to over the years. slip away &the pusher are just simply to 'out there' to actually compare them to the originals, and for me that makes them so enjoyable!and for your listening enjoyment they take a journey on some lengthy orginal jams. ok some of this cd falls flat on its[behind], keep on running the old spencer davis classic and leon russell's delta lady simply could of been left off thisotherwise trippy and jamming masterpiece. so get it if your adventurous otherwise leave it alone and buy some boston. btwany one remember the cd the beautiful people's if 60's were 90's?this cd is a whole lot in that vein but a whole lot more fun!the funky honky"
2,Unconvincing retro junk,"Soul music is great. Funk is great. This, however, is neither soulful or funky and by no means great. This is lousy wannabe music made for lazy losers. I tried to like it. I really did.Mark"
3,"A bargain, but doesn't play well with other kids","Pros:* The Windows drivers installed easily and appeared to work well.* used on Win2k and Win98 systems* signal reception is goodCons:* Can't use WEP encryption if router/wireless hub has a Cisco chipset (Linksys, SMC, etc. rely on Cisco hardware).* Unable to find drivers for Linux"
5,Johnny Stockman is the best artist!,Johnny Stockman drew the animations for this great and fun way for young children to learn about fire safety. He really needs the credit that he deserves as he doesn't profit from this DVD at all. I just thought that I would mention this as his name is not mentioned in the description.
2,More to the World than the Eyes can See,"This book is based in a Californian High School. The plot of More Than Meets the Eye begins to thicken at the high schools Valentine's Day dance. Ben, a Chinese American, is dancing with Elizabeth, a Caucasian, when all of a sudden, Brad, a real firebrand, cuts in and calls Ben a yellow-skinned chicken from China. Ben in a rage storms out of the gym and walks home. The next day, Brad accuses Ben of slashing his tire on his pick-up truck. Ben didn't do it and proves it by cutting open the tire and finding a nail inside. Then two weeks later one Korean and two Japanese come to town and all of the teachers put Ben together in a group with them. On a night, when Elizabeth is supposed to go on a date with Ben, Brad show up and starts talking with her. Ben gets furious and barges in and tells Elizabeth that this might be the end. Will Ben and Elizabeth's relationship end? What will happen to the group of so called Asians? You'll have to red the book to find out!!!"
4,Love Midge Ure!,"Love you, man! Don't you wish all your idols could write intelligent autobiographies that give you insight into their lives and not dash your ideas of what they might really be like? Kind of like when you're afraid to meet them because they might be a jerk and ruin it for you? Happy to say, Midge did not. Very well-written, and shows he's as good a writer as he is musician, and also funny and human. And a good Dad. No images shattered here."
1,Big Waste of Money,"Our daughter wanted a cash register for Christmas, so we bought her this one. First because of the Fisher Price toy quality and secondly because it looked like a great learning toy! Since Christmas my daughter may have played with it 30 minutes total. I couldn't find the extra cartridges anyplace but K-mart with a grim selection. We were really disappointed with this toy. It didn't keep our daughter interested at all. Its a space taker now collecting dust! Finally we bought my daughter a $10 cash register that made her happier than this thing. She will use the plastic food in her kitchen but what a waste!"
5,F/P said they'll send free motion sensor for the scanner,"It took me about an hour to put it together, and I was very pleased with this product. This is a really cute toy. I know my 3 yr. old son will have a lot of fun playing with it(as well as his 6 yr. old brother.) But my scanner didn't work, nor did the light across the top of the register. I called the company, and Fisher price customer service rep. was very nice, and said they will send out a free replacement part for the scanner to work without being in the direct light(it's a motion sensor to replace the light sensor). They also said that the light on the register will only go on when the scanner announces a price...."
2,Too much perfume,"Darn I should have gotten an unscented product. In my opinion, this has a very strong odor. I LOVE the way my skin feels but the smell is just too much."
5,Had trouble finding in stores.,Had looked all over for this stuff and could not find it anywhere. Found it here. Shipped quickly. Packaged well.
3,The formatting is its downfall,"I needed a quick reference for the accupressure points that are relevant to various ailments, but this book drowns the essential usefulness of accupressure with entirely too many words. It tries to present theory and anecdotes in addition to a listing of accupressure points, and ends up being unbearably repetitive. While each treatment has a step-by-step accompanied by photos and lengthy descriptions, a better format would have been to present a short list of the most effective points followed by secondary points for each treatment. As it is, a person who is trying to perform the steps would be too busy reading, rather than concentrating on the points themselves.A much more practical guide is the very brief but far more useful book by Carola Beresford Cooke. If, on the other hand, you are looking for a lengthy thesis, then this book would be to your taste."
3,Acupressure book,"The book sounds good, I haven't used it too much yet, I think the key is to continuously apply acupressure, which takes time and most of the time, I don't have the time."
4,Accupressure Potent Points,"helped my stiff neck and lower back pain, good book and eazy to use. I'm not big on giving credit, but these points works for me."
5,undercabinet TV,"After 2 years, I'm still enjoying the TV. It's got a great picture and I love that I can swivel the screen to meet my position either in the kitchen or dining area. I also love that the remote control can stick to to TV magnetically. I also like the fact that with the radio that's on the TV, I can bring my XM radio in and play it through the TV. The only problem I have with it is that in order to manually change the channel, you must wait until the channel actually comes on before you can move up or down...slow, but, with the remote, you can just push in the number. All in all, it's a great little TV."
1,Deceptive description,"This is a fine socket extender for single-wattage bulbs. I needed a socket extender to adapt a 3-way floor lamp for use with a compact fluorescent 3-way bulb. The product description says: ""May be used with 3-way bulbs"". A little deceptive, as the socket will, indeed, accept a 3-way bulb, however the bulb will then function only as a single-wattage bulb. If you don't need the 3-way feature as I did, then this socket is otherwise quite OK."
3,No smaller than compact fluorescent base,"I ordered these because the compact fluorescent R20 bulbs would not fit in my trac light fixtures (made for regular R20 bulbs). The ceramic ones are no smaller than the bulbs. The ceramic shouldn't be such a big deal for 13watt bulbs anyway (not as hot as regular bulbs), I just ordered them because they were what was available with good shipping. BargainBulbs replaced them with regular composite (plastic) ones that are working fine."
3,A good product.....but...,"This print server does everything it says it does, but the manual and software given is poorly written. The manual is written at a 6th grade level and does not adequatly explain how to get the software to work with the server. In the end it is a good product if you know what you're doing...NOT FOR BEGINNERS"
1,"Windows Only, Please","Even though the documentation says it works with Mac, I haven't found any brain surgeons or rocket scientists who can help me. I have a Windows 98 machine, a new iMac running OS10.2, and a Powerbook (Firewire) running OS 9.2. Up until now, I have had to plug and unplug the USB cable into the back of my Lexmark Z52 printer to use the various computers. Now I can leave the PN7127P plugged in to the printer when I print from the Windows machine, and remove the whole server to pulg in the USB cable to print from the Mac machines. The print server makes the operation much easier....its size allows me to find it without looking around the back of the printer, and it's so much more ergonomic for plugging and unplugging than that tiny little end on the USB cable!"
1,Save your money!,"I am a big fan of Pink Martini and thought I'd try this disc for something a little different in the Cabaret genre and because a couple of decent reviews were posted. Well, those reviewers must be on the payroll of the publisher! This is a one truly dreadful CD. The sound quality is abysmal, and the transitions between tracks are jarring. The tracks selected for the disc just don't ""hang together"" well at all. Save your money!"
5,Perfect for the reason I bought it !,"I got this for Mom because she's at the stage of life that she tends to nod off when she's sitting and reading and now with this perfect pillow she dozes much more comfortably. I love mine, in fact I just bought a fleecy one. Quality product."
1,"WARNING!! DON'T BUY, horrible product....",The warranty on this product is 3 months. 12 days after the warranty the saw stopped cutting only after 20 CUTS!!! Not only that the blade cut crooked. Also the cheap plastic table of the saw is not flat and very difficult to pop in and out. I rate this product with zero stars but I had to put one.
4,"It works well, but a little bit hot","I really like the small size of this router,and the fact that the cables attach from behind,letting me view the leds while reducing the clutter.It has been working well for me.I also like, internally, that it has 1Mb (128KB perport) of buffer space, and that any port can beused as uplink, making it easier to install andmore flexible.Only two very minor negatives.First, the ""blinking"" of the leds when there is activityis at constant rate, so it does not give you a goodidea of the throughput.Second, the switch runs a bit hot; will thisimpact long-term reliability? It's too earlyto tell."
1,CAVEAT EMPTOR,"BE AWARE: The ""Joao Bosco"" on this DVD is NOT the FAMOUS Joao Bosco--the legendary brilliant composer/vocalist/guitarist born in 1944. This is a contemporary pop-singer who sometimes strums a guitar, and was born in 1981. His music is nothing like that of the original Joao Bosco. And the ""Vinicius"" on this disc is NOT the great Vinicius de Moraes, who died in 1980...but some other pop singer the same age as ""Joao II."" This is rather like two British kids selling a DVD in Brazil, without any disclaimer or other information, called PAUL McCARTNEY AND RINGO, LIVE. For whatever it's worth, the pair seem wildly popular with their young audience."
3,"Just O.K. Given the universe, should be much better.","Bill Littlefield made a couple of odd choices, and this series is a bit too narrow (given that it limits to a year's writing).Try Halberstam's ""Best American Sports Writing of the Century"". Much better"
5,mind boggling!!,"I have always dug Ralph Carney's contributions to many recordings, Tin Huey, Tom Waits, to name but a few... I really liked his last c.d.""I like you (a-lot)"" his new one is a GIANT LEAP FORWARD!! it goes to many places, but doesn't feel like he is trying to show off, if you like the ""residents"" early Brian Eno, and the ""memphis jug band"" this is your record!!!"
1,Un thriller más de Robert Ludlum,"Las novelas de Robert Ludlum son tan estereotipados, que no ofrecen más que cualquier otra novela de acción y suspenso. No hay sorpresas, sino desarrollos evidentes de un argumento estandarizado, que siempre sabremos qué va a suceder a continuación. Y esta novela no es una excepción. Sin embargo, cumple la función de entretener por algunas horas, quizás para los viajeros, que deban matar algunas horas de vuelo, y si no hay otro libro disponible en la tienda del aeropuerto."
5,"intelligent, honest, interesting, relevent",the title does not do justice to the depth and intelligence of this book. one of the best on the subject of Jewish identity in America -- and how to develop one -- that I have read.
3,Don't be discouraged,"I just attended a conference where the author was one of the speakers. Being in my late 40's, his message of how to go from success to significance hit home. I purchased Finishing Well and enjoyed the stories he featured of people making a difference in others lives by their service. However, I wish he had included examples of how ordinary people can live a life of significance without the extraordinary wealth, intelligence and fame that his examples seemed to have. Living a life of service to others can be on a small scale with a big impact, depending on your gifts, talents and resources. If you leave this earth and one person is better off because you were here, that is significant. The book left you feeling a bit inadequate, but an interesting read. Maybe better designed for wealthy people looking for a purpose."
1,Fathers &Daughers(Diana Gabaldon),"I was very disappointed in this book. I had expected that 3 authors would write of their experiences, not 11. I can say that the only one that I found interesting was the one by Diana Gabaldon and several were so uninteresting that I didn't finish reading them.I agree with a previous review - this book played on Diana Gabaldon's wonderful reputation and I am sure she would be disappointed in the finished product...."
4,quick collection of sonnets,"this isn't an exhaustive collection of sonnets, nor a serious study. it is simply what it is: a short collection of sonnets that can be purchased cheaply. there are many great sonnets not included and no contemporary sonnets. but it isn't meant to be anything more than what it is. and if you love the sonnet, it's a good collection."
4,Funny and realistic,"Doyle sticks to dialogue to give us the story of Sharon Rabbitte, pregnant and unmarried, and her father Jimmy's efforts to deal with the repercussions, real and imagined, of this event. Doyle finds a rhythm right from the start, with each character being given distinctive voice, from Jimmy's bluster and compassion to Sharon's mixture of self pity and strength, each dealing with events in a very real, funny, and human way. the supporting cast all stand out as individuals, the long suffering mother and the whole Rabbitte clan all have their moments, but the heart of the novel is Jimmy's relationship with his daughter.There is a real sense of paternal love here, and while this novel is a bit slight, it has impact and enough humor for a book twice its length."
4,A nostalgic time capsule,"Although there are recipes in this cookbook that I would like to make, I didn't actually purchase this book for that purpose. I bought it to enjoy as a slice of history - a bit of my Grandmother's America if you will - and it certainly fulfilled my purpose. It is entertaining and enjoyable to read.I only wish the author had included photos of the completed dishes. That addition would have made this book a 5 star in my opinion, especially since I don't actually intend to make most of the dishes myself and this would have increased my pleasure in the book."
2,Get it for the stylus,"Well i got this because i lost both my styluses that came with my ds. I was suprised to see that it had screen protecters (i got it at gamestop) I love the styluses they are the best I've ever had but the screen protecters are bad. the bottom screen protecter was so hard to put on that i tried so many times and it got messed up so i had to throw it out. the one on the top was OK even though i got alot of glares with it... when it got all scratched up and i took it off, it left a sticky residue that made me spend a half hour wiping it with a paper towel soaked with windex... this almost messed my whole ds up... im never putting screen protecters (from pelican) on my ds again..... the styluses are great though"
4,Use and protect your DS.,Both of my grandchildren use their Nintendo DS constantly and lost their stylus. This product is a good price and comes with the screen protector as well.
4,Cotton!,I love this product. I have used it since he was 6 months. I wish the would do an early waker sleepsack in cotton.
4,Great product...but a warm sleeper works just as well,"I have mixed feelings about this sleep sack - it is great for summer use due to it's cotton made material. However, for something warmer in the winter, I recommend the polyester material. It's much softer.On the other hand, if you have sleepers with feet, just put your baby in that - it keeps them just as warm. I must say, though, that my baby prefers being in the sleep sack than being swaddled...so if you have a baby like this, it great!"
4,Puffle pricing,"They are super cute and my son is sure to love his since he asked for it specifically but you can get these at Disney store for $8, at Toys R Us for $6 so why on earth they're selling for this much is beyond me."
2,Okay,"The zipper closes from top to bottom and it got stuck halfway up so I wasn't even able to get it off my daughter without completely ruining the whole (twenty dollar!) thing. Otherwise, I guess it's a good idea. But I definitely didn't buy another one and that was 2 years ago; I have another newborn that I just use warm pjs on."
3,Too Big and too long,I found this to be too big and too long for my son. I liked the idea that it replaced the blanket for bed time but my delema was that you needed to get a long sleeved onsie in the winter for him to use nightly. It was so big for my son he often got caught on things and wrapped up with it. It is not a necessity. I found the old fashioned blankets worked best for my son.
5,"Perfect sleeping bag for summer, washes great and lasts!","This is my 2nd Halo Cotton Sleeping Bag and I LOVE them for my little one! They are great quality, are the perfect weight and wash really well - plus they actually last when using them for months on end (using,washing,drying,etc)! Great product! And I really like the fact that they are all cotton and no polyester."
4,"Fine, but the top area is too large","Good sleepsack, but the neck/arm area is too large. I have a 21 month old, and a friend recommended that I go back to using a sleepsack to get my little guy to stop climbing out of his crib. Genius, it's been great. I started out by ordering an XL, but the neck/shoulder/arm area was so large, it was ridiculous. So, I sent it back and ordered this, a large. Still way too big in the neck, basically whole top/chest area, but it works, so oh well..."
5,Perfect!,"I absolutely love this sleep sack. After using heavier-weight sacks with my baby, I decided it was time to purchase a lighter-weight item to get ready for warmer weather. This one is perfect. It's 100% cotton and feels like a soft t-shirt, and it's 0.5 tog. I agree with other reviewers' suggestions of buying one size larger than you think you need. My daughter is petite at 10 months, weighing just over 18.5 pounds and about 28.5 inches long, but I opted for size large and I'm glad I did.I don't think I saw exact size info posted, so thought I'd share this right from the product's packaging:Newborn: Height 19"" to 23"" and 6-12 poundsSmall: Height 23"" to 26"" and 10-18 poundsMedium: Height 26"" to 30"" and 16-24 poundsLarge: Height 30"" to 35"" and 22-28 poundsX-Large: Height 35"" to 40"" and 26-36 pounds"
2,This is great for kids...,"if they're smoking something. I got this as a discard from the library, and decided it might be suitable for the library in my preschool class. The pictures are cute and yet, disturbing as well. The story makes no sense, and the children did not really enjoy any part of it. I left it in their little library for months, and they never looked at it. This story is simply too bizarre for children, although I'm sure it's great for adults after enjoying certain herbal refreshments.This teacher gives it a ""D""."
5,My favorite Easter book...,"I absolutely love this book. I am in school to be a teacher and found this book while doing a project and read it ten times. I laugh out loud each time I read it, it just gets better and better."
1,Not as described,I purchased this item thinking it would work as described. I could not get the controller to sync with the garage door opener. I am having to return the item.
2,Very short range,"With my old garage door opener I could hit the button one time at the end of my driveway and activate the door. I like the small size of this new remote, but the range is VERY limited and I often have to hit the button 3 or more times in order to activate the door.The bottom line is that I would not buy this product again."
4,A powerful moving story told from an interesting perspective,"This story needs no embellishment--it just needs to be told. A book not just based on history but one that tells history, a powerful moving story. Other than the occasional awkward juxtaposition of the author's personal life with this heroic story, the text flows smoothly once past the first chapter."
1,Waste of money,"go to the nintendo site and they will give you 1 to 4 (you pick how many you want) wrist straps for free, the shippings just a little longer."
4,excellent introduction to algebra thoery,This is a good book for introducing mathematical methods of proof and provides many examples. The examples are easy to follow and the definitions and theorems are well-explained.
4,Very Good,"I feel a bit mean giving 4 stars - it's better than that - but not quite 5.This has some brilliant production and a classic Wu Tang feel - but it's also got his own imprint. Very impressed - going to look out for his work - hopefully he does some stuff with the original 'Generals' in future (Ringing Bells with MK also top notch).Very soulful, very trippy, good lyrics.I lked his work on Wu mets Indie Culture - but this is better"
5,See Jane Die...A MUST READ FOR SPINDLER FANS,"I love to write reviews of books I've read, but I don't like to give too much away when doing it. So let me say about this book, I thoroughly enjoyed it....so much that I read the last 147 pages in the last few hours. It was fast paced and exciting. It had just the right amount of romance and thrilling suspense. I love Jane (the heroine) and her sister Stacey. Detective Mac McPherson, Friend Dave, Janes Husband Ian and even Ranger the Dog. If your looking for a quick read, pick up this book, it definately won't disappoint! See Jane Die, is in a class all buy itself! Well written Ms. Spindler!"
3,Predictable,"Erica Spindler is one of my favorite writers and often I wait impatiently for the next novel to appear on the shelves; but this one fell short. Rarely do I have the plot entirely figured out, but this read like a map!"
5,Great,They look just like the ones from the tv-series and beter then some other I've seen. It's great to see them together with the Cylon Commander and my Cylon Raiders
2,Beware digital glitches...,"Beautiful music, but there are some digital glitches (which occurred during manufacturing) that start at 14:11 on Track 6 of Disc 2. They kind of ruin the music, unfortunately..."
5,Vlad,Good sensor I am glad that he bought particle product works well my car is happy.thanks forking and sold good product.
5,Fenomenal product,"I wanted to give Dr Brown's bottles 5 stars because this product definitely made a difference for us. I used Avent and Playtexx before. My son used to gulp and swallow a lot of air even though they claim that the nipples are of a slow flow. He used to have a lot of discomfort during and after the feedings with air and gas. Now he looks very comfortable when I feed him, he sleeps better and it seems like there is less gas.I would highly recommend this product."
2,Too many parts,"I found these disappointing and annoying. First of all, there are just too many parts to deal with (six with each bottle: cap, valve, nipple, retaining ring, valve holder and bottle).If you're careful like we are about sterilizing everything, the many parts turn out to be a pain in the you-know-what.I also felt that the flow also seems too fast."
2,Not very pleased with them!,"When my second daughter was born she could not tolerate most of the fomula you can buy. When we (my husband and I) found a formula she would somehow tolerate, we also bought Dr. Brown bottles because of the gas she had. I was annoyed and frustrated preparing the formula. I could not shake the bottle (like I did with the Avent bottles) to mix watter with powder. I was losing up to an oz from each bottle. They were also leaking when I was warming up the formula. The 4 oz bottles, the 8oz bottles... they were all the same. Very very annoying. I would not but this brand again. I would try other. I have always liked the avent and now I wish to try them before I have wasted my money on Browns."
1,Dr Browns Bottles Are Made With Bisphenol-A,"I liked Dr Browns Bottles, my daughter Liked them too! Then I found out about Bisphenol -A being used to make the Bottles. After re-searching Bisphenol -A, I discovered that exposing my baby to harmful chemicals with the potential for long term affects later in life, was definitely not for me!! There are other options out there, all glass bottles are safe, as well as Born Free, Mam by Sassy, Green to Grow and Adrini. Do your own research. I'm really surprised the non Bisphenol -A Free bottles haven't been recalled yet! I'm sure it's just a matter of time, before enough people are educated."
2,what is the bottle made out of?,"We purchased these bottles after reading the glowing reviews. Since there has been so much in the news lately about the dangers of many common plastics containing phthalenes and bisphenol, I am surprised that Dr. Brown does not mention what kind of plastic is used in the product-it is not on these pages, their website, the bottles have no number-type, or on the packaging or inserts. I'll be returning this product unused. I'd rather spend three seconds burping than add to his toxic load at this tender age."
5,good but only needed for newborns,"I think the Dr. Brown bottles helped because my son did not have a lot of gas but you really only need them for the first 3 months of life for your baby. After 3 months, the baby's intestines have matured and they do not suffer from painful gas anymore. After that, you are stuck cleaning the many parts to this bottle if you buy a ton of them like I did. I would just buy the small bottles for your newborn and then try a bottle that's easier to clean when s/he gets older and needs a larger bottle."
4,Justice done to great novelist,I read this because I remain convinced that Mr Lowry's novel UNDER THE VOLCANO is one of the great tragic works of literature of the 20th century and its power remains with me after 30 years. In this biography the alcoholic writer's creative process is revealed in detail as well as his determination to destroy himself - in detail. I've often thought of Geoffrey Firmin/Malcolm Lowry as the essential 20th century man - we came close to destroying the world last century but failed. This is a solid well written biography and suits the general reader.
3,Ahora Vengo Yo is missing,The Richie Ray and Bobby Cruz performance is missing. Quality of the video is poor. Sound is poor. Anyway the film is a classic and a must have for salsa souls.
2,This is not a Pokemon game,"At its heart, the Pokemon series has always been about charm, wonder, character, and a magical sense of freedom. Mystery Dungeon isn't a Pokemon game. It's just a normal game with Pokemon in it. Don't be fooled."
3,Another Pokemon,"After waiting so long for this game, my son tired of it quickly. I don't know if it is maybe too difficult for him but he wanted to sell it 2 days after opening it."
1,Overpriced Baloney,"The book tries to be sensationalist. It is an utter failure.No follower of the old Germanic religion hides, ever.Secrecy is in total opposition to Odinism.The claim that there is a ""secret society"" of Odinists is a hoax and serves only to sell this despicable little pamphlet."
4,A fast read.,It's a great book and fast read. I was left wanting to read more. But I did enjoy the book very much.
3,Review of Traditional Dashiki,"The colors on all three Dashikis were brillant and the sizes were great. I do wish they came in thicker material. Interesting that they were not made in Africa, however, the person I ordered them for was very delighted. Home and Gifts keep up the good work."
4,Very tall guy,"Its hard for me to find shirts that fit. Especially since I'm vary tall with 38 inch arms. So I was nervous when I made this purchase but to my suprise, its fits just right. And I'm not sure how they got this to me so fast... They must live in the house next to me or something. Overall, I am pleased with my order and will shop here again.Fondly,Very tall guy"
5,Meets all my expectations,I absolutely love this briefer. I am both tall (5'11) and large. This brief gives me length and holds me in where I need the extra help. I love it!
3,The abdomen is short,The structural quality is fantastic.I am average height and the boobs start too low. Even if your average you may want to get the long torso one. It will probably be just right.
5,A Great Read about today's Heroes,"Superbly written and very hard to put down, this book throws quite a few surprises. Burnett provides first-hand insight into the adventurous and dangerous world of those on the field who distribute humanitarian aid.Relief workers, like those they are trying to help, survive crocodiles, snakes and hippos, feuding warlords, and child soldiers. At the same time they are dealing with competing aid organisations and governments' political and military agendas. Through tears, anger and frustration, he reveals what it is like trying to save lives in a war zone."
2,Too large,These tights were way too large. I don't know if my granddaughter will ever be able to wear them - and she was not a premie or small.
2,Not worth ...,"The title of this book is really misleading. Most of the book is about the history of leather and leathermaking. Then we go on to some tips for sewing and designing garments, but nowhere near the level that one would think, from the title. The book is a little too superficial in terms of actually assisting the designer with designing clothes. ..."
3,Its good but...,"The first Montrose album was great. Sammy Hagar's voice and Ronnie Motrose's guitar was quite a combination. The first 3 songs on this compilation represent that terrific album. The rest of the songs are good but pale in comparision to the first three. Ronnie Montrose needed a stud singer to fully develop his power chord music. If the orginial group would have stayed together, they most likely would have been bigger."
3,What happened to Jump on it one of the best by montrose,like all montrose stuff even gamma songs but why in the hell can't they just reissue the jump on it songs that was great set for them.they got one out called jump on it on cd now but there are no songs from that album whats up with that.
3,San Ho He Did Not Live In Mexico,San ho was born in Ni Hung. Because of the war his mom felt she had to send him to Saigon to live with his moms old friend Kim B. He went to school in Saigon. While in Saigon his mom got married and moved to America. When Saigon fell he was taken by plane to America where he was reunited with his mom. He has a hard time in America. He had to deal with people who didn't like him.I didn't like the book because I thought he lived in Mexico. This complicated things. but you might like it so read it
1,Didn't even bother putting it together,"My son received this 2 years ago, but was a little young for it so we put it away. When we attempted to put it together a few months ago, it also was missing pieces straight out of the box. The parts that were there were cheaply made and difficult to assemble. I was actually coming on line to order the missing pieces from the company, but after reading all of the reviews, I don't think I'll bother. It looked like such a neat gift. Very disappointing."
5,ANOTHER GOOD ONE,"This entry in the long-running series finds Deputy Marshal Custis Long chasing a crooked customs inspector south of the border into Mexico, where he promptly gets involved with warring ranchers, a pair of dormant -- or are they? -- volcanoes, and the usual beautiful but dangerous women. There's even a mention of Jessie Starbuck from the late, lamented Lone Star series, demonstrating that this particular author working behind the Evans pseudonym really knows the history of the character. A fine job all around."
1,very low quality product,2 Port Firewire PCMCIA cardbus from Compaq: the quality is really low. I could not get consistant connection between my laptop and my camera. I have to order another card from a different manufacture the 2nd day after I got this one. The 2nd one works fine.
5,I wish every product was this perfect.,Step One: snip plastic around package. Step Two: plug into PCMIA slot. Step Three: enjoy.That's all there is to it.Works fine on an older laptop running XP.I really wish everything were this simple.Jerry
5,Works great and is cheap!!!,I used this device to connect my video camera up to Adobe OnLocation and it worked perfectly and without hassle. I've used it four times since the purchase and has worked with eas every time
1,Pump didn't work,I've purchased this product for over 15 years & this is the first time the pump has failed to work. The cream itself should still be good but I can't get to it. I bought this awhile back and just now tried to use it so too late to ask for a refund/return. This shud not reflect on the seller so much.I just wish I'd bought it locally to make a return easier.
2,1 of the 2 Floats,"Seems like a heavy-duty product. Just used the 2 floaties we purchased for the first time. Unfortunately, one of the recliners is losing air, but we can't find the hole. Guess they're not so heavy-duty after all. Already trashed the box, so can't return the product. Bummer."
4,Pool Lounge,"I just received the Intex Lounge. It sits a little high in the water so I was worried about being able to get on. I have a bad knee & it was a little hard to get on the first time, but now I have figured it out & it is a cinch & I am hooked. It is one of the most comfortable floats I have owned & would recommend it for anyone who just likes to float around & enjoy the pool. It is very roomy & is great to nap on since I am usually the only one in the pool. We will see how long it lasts, but seems to be pretty durable. I have paid more for floats that did not even last through one season so have high hopes for this one."
3,FLOATING LOUNGER,"The delivery and packaging was good with the item arriving intact. We have not yet had the opportunity to use the Lounge yet as it is still winter, so quality assumptions are purely speculative at this point. Still, it looks like a good product."
5,Intex Floating Recliner ordered from Amazon.com,I love my new recliner! It is sturdy and allows me to read while floating in the pool and does not illicit a neck ache. I am also able to float without getting wet if the water is too cold.
3,"Pleasant, tuneful musical comedy.","Reviewers have not been kind to Deanna Durbin's post-1946 films so this may be the best of her last 3 or 4 films. The plot is silly and light as a feather but painless and on the plus side is a very good score by Johnny Green and Leo Robin, the manic energy of Donald O'Connor and Deanna, herself who is in very good form vocally."
3,It's Okay.,Found it a little harder than I thought but the grandkids liked it and did fine with it. Guess that what it was for.
3,DO REAL ANARCHISTS MAKE FILMS?,"The movie is largely a first person narration by a man who calls himself ""Puck."" He is part of a lame group of people who call themselves ""anarchists."" They have no rules except, no smoking, no violence, no hurting animals etc. They are lead by an old hippy named Johnny Red. They do protests in hope to generate awareness and media coverage. Puck speaks mostly in clichés, bumper sticker slogans, and quotes lines at random from cult films.Then one day enters Johnny Black. Johnny Black uses the popular ""Anarchist Cookbook"" to generate bombs, drugs etc. in order to bring down the man. He also uses cyberspace attacks. Johnny Black takes over the group.Meanwhile Puck gets involved with a young Christian Republican woman who is everything he is not, but ironically seem to have the same core values. Puck struggles between saving the planet from governments and corporations vs rescuing his friends and pursuing love and normalcy."
2,Bad Mix,"Sorry to dump on an Austin DJ, but this ""mix"" doesn't work. The songs start out OK, with great dance beats, but then the vocals cut in and every song becomes an ulistenable, undancable set of overdone high pitched vocal tracks and the ""groove"" is lost.While there is nothing wrong with vocal trax, a DJ putting out a CD needs to find collections of songs that have vocals for the 21st century, not rehashes of old disco ideas by wanna-be dance club divas. Maybe some old dance club burnouts will like this stuyff, since it reminds them of the mid--late 1970's, but for the hip and trendy in the dance club set, this is a collection of ""square noises""."
1,Time Lost!,"I just finished reading ""Trapped"" by Lori Foster and all I can think is...There's 2 hours I'll NEVER get back! I certainly have to agree with the reader from Bloomington about the TSTL hero & heroine, (I don't care how good looking Ms. Foster has made them out to be). Oh Please! This guy (shallow as he is) has known her (conceited as she is) all his life more or less and within a couple hours he's ""discovered"" that he loves her AND wants her to be the mother of his children. Maybe, and that's a big MAYBE, if this story could have been more in-depth, developed the characters, the history, and the storyline more it might have had a chance at mediocre. I read romance books occasionally in between some of the murder/mystery/thriller books I mostly read, to give my brain a rest from the serial killers. I'm hesitant to read the other stories in this book, not sure I want to escape a serial killer that badly. Think I'll stick to Nora Roberts from here on out."
4,Go ahead - Try This At Home!,"This here's the Real Thing - if you like creepin' through the bayou and squishin' the green crawlies with your bare feet, your gonna luv these tunes! These Blues are straight and raw -with a little Roots thrown in for seasonin'; yessir, the ole Preacher Boy's got what you need.This album shows respect for the earliest forms of American Blues Music. It has character and class - give it a try if you're ready!"
1,Do not buy this,"Seriously, this just came in the mail for me today. I put it on my wish list because I thought it was pretty. It's SUPER CHEAP looking for one. It's made outta plastic on another note. If it was like $5 that would be fine, but seriously it's $30 and for what? A piece of junk you can buy at family dollar."
5,What a Help!,This DVD is wonderful! I would never attempt these recipes without such a great demonstration and instructive DVD. Lorraine's easy-going manner makes it so easy to follow along.
5,Heaven,When I first heard this album I was completely amazed. Its a perfect album for listening in the car driving at the A4 during the night(The Hague-Amsterdam) at 220 KM/H. There's only on bad song at the album and you may discover which one.
3,Dissapointed,"Was dissapointed with rollin in my 5.0 Live version! That is the song I was really looking forward to! Oh well, the rest was good though!!"
4,CCNA TestMaster,Has someone that has gone through the Cisco Certified Network Associate (CCNA) curriculum I can say that this book would be a great help to anyone that needs to pass the test and do a great job this is the book.
5,Ideal book for interview prep work,"The key is to ready somewhat flexible answers so that you will be able to 'think on the fly' and impress your interviewer with your thoughtfulness, perceptiveness, and preparedness. In other words, familiarize yourself with the 201 Most Frequently Asked Interview Questions but realize that many of these questions are similar and that many answers are interchangeable. As a job market author, I have spoken with a half dozen successful interviewees about this book; they have recommended Best Answers, and I would recommend it too."
3,Just Okay,"There was some good information in this book. However, there's very little new infromation that's not available for free somewhere else. What's you're paying for is mainly the time it took the author to compile the infromation gathered from numerous places. Most people serious enough to buy a book like this probably won't have a problem finding work anyway."
2,If you can buy it cheap then it may be worth looking into.,"The beginning chapters are just fluff & common sense. However, it will at least get you thinking about what you may incounter during an interview. I wouldn't rule this book out completley. The biggest problem I had with this book was that, unless you have tons of time to practice and study each question, it is simply impractical to expect to cover all the material. My advice would be to prepare more general areas for the interview. Focusing on particular questions is almost a waste of time."
4,Hella H3 worth the money,Ordered the Hella H3 bulbs and recived them quicker than the promise date. Nice. The bulbs are nice and bright and worth the money.
5,fast shipping,"Ordered this for my kids, shipped fast....only thing is I have to select the sound function and change it to be able to play in my DVD....or I have no sound due to the surround sound...times have changed"
4,Awsome Movie!,"First I saw ""Turbo, A Power Rangers Movie"" and I liked it, sort of. Then my Mom let me tape ""Mighty Morphin Power Rangers"" and it was awsome. That Ivan Ooze guy was funny. Along with his other bad guys, Lord Zedd, Rita Repaulse, Goldar, and Mordant. And the fact the Ivan brings two giant machines of an ant, and a scurpion. Now the Rangers must defeat them and Ivan. YOU HAVE TO SEE THIS FILM!!!"
4,Excellent adaptation,"Well, this is more better and entertaining than the more lightweight (and to mention more cheesier) TV series it's adapted from. The Rangers take off nicely in their first silver-screen debut and the villains are *very* funny, in any way possible. (It seems like they're the main part of the movie, but they're not.)The costuming is brilliantly designed and the fight sequences are indefinitely better than the spandex-clad Rangers (really fancy armor). The scenery is good, the plot is predictable, but it's nevertheless entertaining.To all of you people who list ""MMPR: The Movie"" as one of the most horrible movies ever made, you are terribly mistaken. If you want to see a bad movie, try ""See Spot Run."" THIS is better and a good way to kill time, also.Rated PG for nonstop fantasy action violence."
2,Pathetic,"Rita the Alien Witch and Lord Zed release an ancient evil that overtakes the world by marketing evil ooze at a small corner shop. Long ago I have seen snippets and parts of this film and it seemed intriguing. And, yes, if you don't mind the characters, what is left of the film is quite enticing - a primeval world, an ancient shrine, a run for an ancient weapon, that is all fine and interesting, even semi-epic at times. But the characters, the plot, the acting, and especially the script merge to create the perfect dead film not dissimilar from Plan 9 from Outer Space, only with better special effects. The special effects themselves are quite outdated, the shapes having no skins attached, merely chrome-like colors. I enjoyed the giant insects and the new Zords, but besides that, this film is nothing."
4,Enjoyable Read,"Although I found this book totally unrealistic, I enjoyed it so much that I read it in less than one day. I loved the fact that Ms. Goss didn't feel compelled to describe vivid love scenes or use any profanity. I liked the characters, eventhough I thought that Nikki was off her rocker at times and Byron was just too understanding. But when you see the book for what it really is, which is fiction, it makes for a good, clean, and pleasurable read. I would recommend to all my reading friends."
2,A Painful and Slow Read,"This book reads like a graduate thesis. It manages to bury interesting ideas with overly drawn out explanations and arguments. Each chapter should be pared down to a third of its length, but I recommend not finding out for yourself; spend your money elsewhere."
4,A great pair of ideas fantastically exposed.,"In this new book, the author put forward a great metaphore of gradual evolution: adaptative peaks that can't be climbed but in small, easy steps, and the early point of Nature tracing trajectories in ""phenotype space"", the set of all imaginable shapes living thing could take. Every point is beatufully illustrated with examples from both the real world and virtual ones. It is an ideal read for someone who has not exhaustive formation in the field of evolutionary biology, but anyone else can enjoy the mental amusement Dawkins provide with his neat and precise writing."
2,Not for me.,"The mounts are not great by desing in the fact you are clamping the to the barrel and then clamping scope rings to the top, and because of the small gap left in between the mount this obviously loosens the mounts. sure you can crank them down but it will scrape the barrel."
1,Not Good!!!,"Very disappointed with theses. Too hard to tighten, and then when you mount a scope, they seem to open up and become loose. I read other reviews about this same issue but decided to try them anyway, my mistake. I am now going with the Air Venture Intermount base."
1,Nope. Stay away. Crosman 459MT is a better solution.,"I bought both this andCrosman 459MT 2-Pc Intermount, 3/8 Dovetailto try them out.The 459MT is the clear winner. See my user-submitted photos with both mounts on the same gun (Crosman 1322).While the B272 is a little fancier looking, it is MUCH less stable and doesn't physically look like it fits better on the pistol.Further, the 459MT tightens down very securely without nearly stripping the bolt. However, I found the B272 very loose with even moderate tightening. I tightened down even further, to almost the point of stripping, and it still wants to wobble and wiggle.Returning for refund. The 459MT is a much better purchase. Oddly, they're both made by Crosman."
4,This mount doesn't fit the C9 .20 without modification.,"Equipment arrived in a timely manner... I was halfway anticipating them to not fit my C9 series .20 although this was never stated. Even by the Crossman Benjamin Sheridan website...I'd read some threads that it was a bad fit without modification.A simple fix is to grind down the ridges on both sides of these (4) pieces and they will close enough around the .20 barrel for a snug fit for a dove tail type scope mount.I'm satisfied with my results and the price was ok. Thus the 4 rating... If you want something to fit your C9 series .20 perfectly, don't order this."
4,Agree with SanDee,"I also really like this cup holder for my scooter. It holds drinks securely; however, it's a little flimsy. I've already broken 3 of them by catching on a doorjam or drawer handle. I also wish there were some way to just reorder the holder part that snaps in and out rather than the entire assembly, as I don't need to replace the hardware that's securely attached under the armrest. I'm now going to order two of them so the next time it breaks I'll have one ready to replace!"
1,Does not fit....,This cup holder arrived but will not fit a powerchair with a channeled armrest. Tried to contact the company for a return but was unable to ever get in contact with anyone. Finally got in contact with the company who's product I purchased and they informed me that I have the wrong type cup holder but they were unable to exchange or assist me. Disappointed.
5,Porter- Cable Router Bits,I was amazed how quickly these came. I ordered them one day and they were here the next. I bought these as a gift for my son who is getting started in woodworking and just got a new router. I wanted good quality bits and not the cheap ones you burn up the first time you use them. These bits certainly seems to be what I expected from Porter Cable. They are comparable to the bits you would normally pay $15-20 apiece for if you purchased them individually.
1,try a different brand,"i've had nothing but trouble with my memorex 128mb card. i'm using it with a korg pxr4 digital recorder, and it periodically stops being recognized by the recorder or my card reader, and i've lost a lot of data and time.i've had no problems with other cards. just this one.the little plastic case is nice, though."
3,"Not ""The Very Best Of...""","This is good to get if you are not the ELP fan and just like their acoustic songs like everybody else. However, if you are the ELP fan, you will think,""Why isn't Tarkus in here, or The Endless Enigma, or Hoedown, or Take a Pebble, or...(and the list goes on and on). If you want a better ""Best of"", go for ""The Best of Emerson Lake & Palmer"" or ""ELP: The Atlantic Years"".PROs: You get the great acoustic songs: Lucky Man, From the Beginning, Still... You Turn Me On, and C'est La Vie. And you get great rock songs like Pirates, the full Fanfare For The Comman Man, Knife-Edge, Karn Evil 9 1st Impression Part 2, Jerusalem, and Trilogy.CONs: It lacks a lot of songs. Also, the live versions here aren't all that great. An ELP fan would know why this is not ""The Very Best Of Emerson Lake & Palmer"".Look for better ""Best of""s than this one."
1,WHAT ARE THE EPISODES????????,I don't know how they ever expect to sell this item when they will not tell you what you are spending your hard earned cash for.
2,John Fennelly was a day late and a dollar short,"If you really want to read stories about the Skeena river system's Steelhead fishing history, then read Buzz Fiorini's book ""Flying over Rainbows"".Buzz was really the one who opened up this area to fishing with his Float Plane. He guided people like Bing Crosby as well as John Fennelly up into these virgin waters. Buzz was not to happy when Fennelly came out with his book because it started a ""Steel"" Rush to the Skeena valley which deflowered Mother Natures little secret once in for all.Flying over rainbows: A lifetime of fishing, flying and fly fishing : experiences of Buzz Fiorini"
1,One of the worst movies I've ever seen should be Zero stars.,"Firstly, I love bad movies. Cult and horror movies are usually my favorite genre. They are usually so bad they are good, if you get me.This movie is just bad. I believe that high-school kids with a camcorder could have produced a better film than this. In fact, I demanded a refund from my rental store and they happily obliged having received many complaints from other outraged customers like me.I cannot believe a movie this terrible could be released and sold. It is like a bait-and-switch, because many people are interested in the story of the Zodiac Killer, however, this movies acting, pacing, sound, visuals, and anything else you could name is absolutely horrible so no matter what angle you view it from , it gets a big, fat, F."
1,Total Crap,"I gave this film one star because of the attempt of making a movie. I expect some level of quality when choosing a movie from a Blockbuster shelf of all places, and this movie did not deliver. I did not like the homemade film quality of the production, which instantly brings out the acting in the movie and makes it completely transparent. I also did not like that guys haircut. I had to stop it half way through, and I had to make myself watch that much of it. I understood that it was a lowbudget film from the first frame which is why I gave it a shot, but I soon realized that the film would have received more funding if the director was better, which he is obviously not. I can understand how an indie film buff could justify this as being somewhere close to a mediocre movie, but I'm not calling it that. I don't know anything about Ulli or his other works, I am reviewing this from the perspective of an adventurous movie renter, and I cannot recommend this to anybody."
1,"Terrible, just horrible.","Hands down one of the worst movies I have ever watched. It wasn't factual, the actors stunk, and the quality was horrible. A total rip-off."
4,A good introduction to the world of worry,"I disagree with the reader from Minneapolis who feels that this book won't help you worry less -- you just have to read past the case studies that dominate the first two sections. The third section of the book (chapters 19-26) contains a good deal of practical advice that goes beyond Prozac, exercise, and low alcohol consumption. I would recommend this book as a good starting point for those who know they worry too much, but aren't sure if they worry enough to see a physician or psychologist."
2,Frommers Took the Best Ideas,"This is probably a good book, but if you buy the Frommers Guide to Santa Fe, Taos, and Albuquerque you get the same ""hidden"" details and more accurate reviews. Brought this book on my vacation and maybe got two bits of interesting info from it once after I got there."
2,Not intended for a novice,"I was disappointed in the quality of this book compared to other books on the market.The book is not in color and the layout is very difficult to use. The drawings don't contain the common names of the plants. It is not intended for a novice. If you are not a tree expert, and want to identify tress, I would recommend these tree books instead. ""Garden Trees"" by Richard Rosenfeld, ""Trees of North America"" by Roger Phillips, and the Smithsonian Handbook ""Trees"" by Allen J. Coombes."
3,"Big fish, small pond","This is THE book on the history of Jordan. I mean that literally: you won't find any other general works in English. Salibi is a respected historian who has written interesting works about Lebanon, so this tepid history of Jordan is something of a disappointment. It's not an awful book, but nor is it a very good one.This is a history intended for the general reader, so it lacks detail and analysis, but it fails to make up for this in readability. The writing, while accessible, is hardly inspired. Salibi notes that he was given access to (former) Crown Prince Hassan's private library for the book, and reading his hagiographical treatment of Abdullah and Hussein, one wonders how beholden to the Hashemite throne Salibi is.Still, it's the only game in town."
5,Only for the Serious Funkers!,"Why is there so little reviews about this cd? Dirty Walt PUT IT DOWN! Do you hear me! For those of you who REALLY like funk, you need to add this one to your cd player. OK. brotha' talks about weed and sex to the max but the music is ORIGINAL! Can I get an AMEN! I have a long daily commute from home to work and when you have great music (Fishbone, Living Colour, 24/7 SPYZ, Weapon of Choice, Cee-Lo Green, WAR), the ride is easy. Buy this cd and enjoy!"
3,cable strength,"Note that with 3/16 steel cable, this has a single line breaking strength around 4000 pounds and a safe working load of around 800 pounds. You can double that with the block. I would expect it to break before 5 tons."
2,No 5-Ton ability,This come-along does not seem to have the claimed capacity. On my first use the cable split the metal drum it rolls around and the cable was flattened. If you have a big job to do buy a better one.
3,so-so,"this arc is ok, i dont really see how someone imitating iron man and murdering people can cause him to be 'disassembled' , because its happened before in one way or another, in the way the rest of the team was, or thor was, for that matter. but its still a good story, the artowrk is a little bland and lame for my taste. i'm so glad the arc after this (extremis, after the series gets re numbered) came out, that really changed the character for me. my whole life up to and including this arc, iron man was smart and cool but he was not always at teh top of my list of 'OH MY GOD new iron man this week!!!!"" type of deal. now he is, good times!"
4,Kids love it - Drives parents nuts!,"My daughters fight over this thing all the time and the 3 songs get annoying real quick but they all have a great time with it! The microphone headset is pretty much useless, doesn't fit any of my kids properly (ages 2, 4 and 6). It seems like it is pretty well made andhas held up to some mild abuse so far."
4,Loving It!,"I was very skeptical of the product after reading reviews. I consider myself to be on the over protective side, and the song lyrics concerned me after reading previous reviews. However, my 4 year old daughter got it for her Birthday, and loves it. Even my 2 year old like to play it. The songs are OK, I wish like most, we had a selection to choose from, but honestly she doesn't concern herself with the actual lyrics. She is just so excited to be playing! I recomend it, even with the songs!"
3,Not her Best &#65533; But O.K.,Gossip Hound is the story of a young girl who works in PR for a publishing company named Grace. Thrown into the mix is a gossip hound named Belinda Black that writes trash about celebrities for a paper. I found the story hard to get into. Wendy kept loosing me in which character she was talking about. They didn't seem to be very well defined. About of the way through the story she pulls it together though. By the end of the story I was enjoying the book and found myself hoping Grace could get it together and not loose herself too much. The problem is keeping the book open until you hit this point.Grace is a wonderful character that reminds me of a lot of other Wendy female characters in her man troubles and outlook on life. Belinda is exactly like most of Wendy's money-crazed freaks. Although by the end of the story both of these characters have evolved and are more true to real-life than some of her others.A worthwhile read - just a slow starter.
5,Absolutely Hilarious!,"I couldn't disagree more with the reviewer who said this book was uninteresting. I read it in 2 days, could barely put it down to go to the grocery store when I noticed I was out of milk. As far as the choking of the little dog - it is funny (and I'm a dog lover), especially when he gets thrown in the gazpacho because he throws up in Belinda's (tabloid journalist) Prada purse. This book has humor, romance, even a seafood laden fight between half-naked women over a naked movie star! I loved Bridget, loved Jemima J, now I love Grace just as much. For all fans of ""chick lit"", british humor, or just a good read to take your mind off things for a while - I highly recommend Gossip Hound."
4,Laugh-Out Loud Funny,"I loved this book. I started reading it at work and was literally laughing out loud at certain times and my co-workers thought I was crazy.I was familiar with Wendy Holden's work as I had already read Bad heir Day, that book was good, but not nearly as much fun as this book. It is just a simple guilty pleasure!You will love the character of Grace, she is so good and tries so hard, you just have to relate to her on some level. She finally sheds her good girl image for a chance at love(?) and, of course, it all blows up in her face.There is more to the story, though and it is thoroughly enjoyable.If you are a fan of the Bridget Jones or Shopaholic books, you will love Gossip Hound."
5,Je Riviens by Worth,"This product, my late wife used when we were dating, back in the 70's, in England. We tried to find it here in the States in the 80's and was told in was discontinued.My oldest Daughter told me that she had this sense to look for perfume named Worth. I went on line and found this on your site. I could'nt beleave it, that it was available, and could'nt beleave the price. She realy loves it and brings back fond memories. great service and prompt delivery. 5 star."
4,Very good. New way of looking at trading.,"This book helped me take a fresh look at trading, and why I was failing. The problems are psychological, and 100% fixable."
5,Good Work,"This book is a work of art,a must read for any serious trader.This is the first book I have read by this author,for me it's one of the best psycology book out there,It's a book I keep handy reading certin chapters when ever necessary.This one will never be out dated,great buy."
4,A Must read for a Trader,Thought provoking and revealing book. Not how to trade shares but how to prepare your mind and how to set up a system to manage risk. I have read it three times and each new read reveals hidden treasures. One can pick it up and read a chapter just to renew your thought processes!
5,What is the turkey from Istanbul talking about?,"The author does mention his course and website in passing, but I would certain not consider his fine book to be an advertisement. What is the turkey from Istanbul talking about? The author goes into detail on the 6 elements of a successful system."
2,Very Disappointed,"After reading about Tharp in Market Wizards and reading all the glowing reviews here, I was very disappointed in this book. If you have read other books such as Oneill's How to Make Money In Stocks and Lefevre's Reminiscences of a Stock Opertor much of this information is a rehash. In fact the author mentions these other books often. It also seemed to be an advertisement for his other more expensive books and seminars. I was drawn to the book because I wanted to get inside the head of a trader. To find out why I was making good or bad trades from a psychological basis. This book offered almost none of that. There are better books out there if you're looking for a trading system."
5,Beekeepers Poetry,"What a great book full of insights, humour and knowledge about bees in the world. Great easy read which has appealed to this new amateur beekeeper"
1,DONT BUY IT,"Dont waste your money on this garbage. We recently saw the fountain at a demo at a local store. It looked like it worked beautifully in the store.We bought one and broght it to a party with all the chocolate and food. This thing was a flop! IT is very loud, which I would have overlooked if it worked well. However, the thing wobbles so much you can not get it steady!We tried to level it with the buttons on the bottom, It never worked correctly. I returned it and bought the Rival Chocolate fountain which worked MUCH better and was much sturdier, and the same price.This one was a hunk o junk! Save yourself the trip to the stores and the heartache of a dessert that fails and Dont buy it."
2,Scared Away,I recently ordered this item and then after ordering it read the reviews. I immediately canceled my order! I don't want a loud overbearing machine. Thank You for your comments!
4,SEE IT FOR THE ACTION AND SETTING,"Tale is a mix of horror, action, western and Sci Fi with the focus on action. It's a what if world type in which humans fight vampires (who look like aliens and break the traditional human vampire look) and actually win but at great cost to the planet. The Church is actually in charge having trained the best warriors called priests. There's lots of action, a basic story and credible acting. This is the type of film that you see mostly for the action and the setting. Based on a Korean comic of the same name. It entered development in 2005 and had some complications. $60M to make but only about $78M at the box office. CHARACTERS/DIALOGUE: B minus to B; STORY/PLOTTING: B; ACTION SCENES: B to B plus; SETTING DETAILS: B minus to B; OVERALL GRADE: B; WHEN WATCHED: early November 2011."
4,Priest,If you are into the silly action movies like I am then you will like this movie. It is kinda along the same lines as Blade with that tax cheat westly snipes.I liked the movie because it was well done for that kind of movie. IT is not a greand production but is a good action movie if you like the good guy taking out creatures.
5,Awesome movie,"this is an awesome movie, one of the best i've seen this year priest is action packed from start to finish. this movie is awesome. the story and the actors are great. i love this movie and you will to. if you have not seen this movie then i recommend that you do"
2,average movie-average 3d,"Well.....it wasn't one of my favorite movies.Doubt if i'll rewatch it.The 3d was ok..I love a good vampire movie,however,this futuristic breed of vampires did nothing for me.I'm sorry,even for 3d tv owners,i can't really say this is a must see."
2,When Vampires Attack: Volume...Too many,"Did we really need another Legion? Okay, Priest might be slightly better than Paul Bettany's other recent supernatural action film, but not by much. It's another vampire movie. Well...a group of ninja like Priests against vampires. There are a couple of neat visuals and action scenes, but the story, dialogue and acting needed some serious help. I left the theater thinking what a pointless mess Priest was. This is coming from someone who liked the Underworld and Blade movies. I even enjoyed Daybreakers. I don't mind stupid movies, but this one lacked any sense of fun and I ultimately left wishing I waited to rent this one."
3,for what it was i enjoyed it,"i read / heard a lot of poor reviews of this movie when it hit the theater. these were from movie critics and people that didnt realize what they were getting into im sure.this is an action movie... plain and simple. there is hardly any story, hardly any character development. nothing but action and and good looking cg. dont buy / rent this looking for anything different.the one and only complaint is that the movie could be longer."
3,Not a particularly good movie and the 3D was average.,"I bought this 3D movie for $20 because it was one of the cheapest 3D blurays I could find. The 3D is average quality. There is a scene where they use animation and the 3D looks pretty good during that particular scene but for the rest of the movie it is simply ok. As for the movie itself, it was below average. I wont write a detailed review on the plot or the dialogue since I was only interested in this movie for the 3D. It's a movie about vampires and vampire slayers that are apparently also priests. Nothing memorable. I would suggest you go to RottenTomatoes.com for the movie review. I can say that if you just want to see a 3D movie and this movie is the cheapest one you can find and it isn't more than $20 I would say go for it."
1,Not worth even 1 star,"Boring, uninspired, waste of time, money, and production. Not even worth writing about except in the hope of steering people away from this tragedy of a film."
4,Great movie! Better as a t.v. movie though!,I watched Priest with my cousin and brother. It was a good movie. I liked the plot about a totally hot priest (Paul Bettany) is trying to rescue his neice from vampires along with the neices equally hot boyfriend (Cam Gigandet)and Paul Bettanys love interest Maggie Q. I thought the acting could have been a little better and I wanted to see more romance action between Paul Bettany and Maggie Q. But other than that I liked the plot. And at least you'll get to see two hot guys in the movie. I hope They make a sequel to this movie. Because the end left me hanging what will happen next?
1,Don't waste your time,the whole movie is riding the motorcycle chasing each other in the desert. you will not recall this movie after two weeks for this movie has nothing to remember.
1,Batman goes to church?,"This whole movie felt like a cliche with nothing new or interesting to offer. It's something of a watered down soulless Batman, or Judge Dredd."
5,Owner of lab/toller,I love the book. Its very informational. We recently got a dog which we knew the mom was a lab but didnt know the dad. When we took her to the vet to start her shots the vet said she looked to be a Nova Scotia Duck Toller Retriever. Well we had no idea what they were and then began researching and I am positive the vet knew what he was talking about because she looks identical to the picture on this book and the traits and discription in the book is her to a T. If they didnt know the mom was a lab I'd swear she was pure bred Duck Toller. She loves water. When it rains she loves to go for walks in the yard in the rain. She'll play in the water coming out of the spouting. So this book really helped us find out alot of stuff about a dog we knew nothing about. She is a great dog....very smart.
3,Not enough breed specific information,"I have to agree with the other reviewer that 90% of this book is rather generic. Most of the information is pretty basic and can be found most anywhere. I was looking for more breed specific information about Tollers, their personality and how to best use that information for training."
4,Cool Stuff,"Hey do you like downtempo chilled out electronica? Then you'll like everything Zero One has put out. I listen to this and all the albums on a regular basis, especially when I get home from work and need a little something to pair up with my glass of wine. Easy on the brain music! After a day on the job what more could you ask of your music......"
1,Don't waste your money.,"This video gives a glimpse into the activities of the Wally Byam Caravan Club, which is OK if that's all you want. The title ""Silver Palace"" makes it sound like you're going to learn at least something about Airstream trailers and their history. Not only is it very short, but it tells nothing whatsoever about the trailers. I can't believe I paid nearly $20 for this thing!"
5,Cohen DVD,This DVD arrived undamaged. It was the same condition as described and when played the quality was great with no damage. I'd purchase from this seller again.
1,PAGES WERE WATER STAINED AND WAVY,"I WAS EXTREMELY DISAPPOINTED IN THE QUALITY OF THE BOOK OF MUSIC I RECEIVED. THE PAGES HAD OBVIOUSLY GOTTEN WET AND DRIED, SO THE BOOK WAS ALL OUT OF SHAPE. WHEN TRYING TO COPY IT TO MAKE AN EXTRA ONE FOR MY ACCOMPANIST, IT CONSTANTLY GOT STUCK IN THE MACHINE AND IT TOOK FOREVER TO GET THE COPYING DONE. THIS BOOK WAS IN TERRIBLE SHAPE AND I WASTED A LOT OF MONEY TRYING TO COPY IT OVER AND OVER AGAIN. I WILL NEVER NEVER BUY A USED COPY AGAIN AS A RESULT. I LEARNED MY LESSON, BUT THE SELLER OF THE BOOK SHOULD BE ASHAMED OF THEMSELVES FOR MISREPRESENTATION.!!!!!!"
3,Repetitive,The book is alright. Seems to me like a lot of it is repeated over and over. He spends more time telling you what he is going to tell you than actually telling it. Does offer some good insights though.
3,Read on a recommendation,"The idea is good and worth exploring but I don't this book satisfied what I was looking for. The author writes well, but after reading I felt that I could have absorbed the same information after reading a 3-4 page summery and a quarter of the time it took me to read this book. I have spoken to people that have read it and they say it helped but I didn't really get an ""a-ha"" moment during or after reading."
3,What is love?,"""The Five Love Languages"" is great, and it is a great way to learn how to love your spouse in the ways that actually allow them to experience the love you so desperately want to give.However, the problem with this book and this concept is that it assumes you know what it means to love.God made love, and He made it in such a way that it demands certain things.You cannot love your spouse truly as God designed without first loving who you are in Him, without first seeing yourself as He sees you.You must get to the core of the problem first. You must get to the heart of the issues first. You must start with your foundation, which is you, God, and your relationship with Him.Then, and only then, can you begin to truly speak your spouse's ""language.""(..."
4,Good Book,"This book is excellent. However, I dont know that I love the philosophy of putting people in boxes. I think in our society we are trying to pigeon hole everyone and this is one of the ways to do it. Now, if your just looking for ways to understand people and their needs better...or your needs better...this might be the book for you."
4,LEARNING TO LOVE,"THE FOCUS OF THE BOOK IS TO HELP YOU IDENTIFY WHAT ACTIVITIESARE SEEN BY YOUR LOVED ONE AS POSITIVE OR ""LOVE"". CHAPMAN HELPSYOU TO LEARN HOW YOUR LOVED ONE WANTS YOU TO DEMONSTRATE YOUR LOVE.IT MAY BE PHYSICAL LOVE, A GIFT, MOWING THE YARD OR OR IRONING HISSHIRTS. TOUCHING HER, TALKING OR NOT TALKING TO HIM WHILE READING,GOING TO CHURCH AS A COUPLE. EACH OF US HAS SOMETHING WE LIKE DONETO US OR FOR US THAT WE RELATE TO LOVE."
5,A Must for All,This book is a must have for those getting ready for marrige all the way to those who have been married for years. I use this book in pre-marital counseling and believe it would be a good addition to your library.
5,Essential Reading,"My wife tried to get me to read this book soon after we got married. Being a guy, I didn't want to read some girly book about love though! O what a mistake! Nine years later, I had a change of heart and discovered that I had missed out on so much in the last nine years because I didn't understand the language my wife was speaking. If you want to be able to show your spouse that you love them and/or you are confused about why they don't seem to show you love, then read this book. It will open up a whole new world of understanding for you!"
5,"5 Love Languages, Great Book! What an eye opener.",My wife and I listened to this book while on vacation and realized that we have been looking at how we love each other completely wrong. She appreciates acts of service and I am words of affermation. Neither one of us was speaking the others language very well.Well worth the read or listen. You won't be disapointed.
4,The Five Love Languages: How to express heartfelt commitment to your mate,Was an interesting way to think about what your mate really wants when it comes to love.
2,Words of Affirmations for the author?,"I have read the book 'The five love languages' and the ideas in it are quite interesting. But I have never read a book of someone who has such a high self-esteem. He always finds a way to mention his own name over and over. He doesn't really praise the ideas, he let the people he states praise him as miracle maker. I'm sure he has a high quota of failures as every other marriage counselor too. This book is a written sermon."
5,A great book for understanding your marriage partner and others,"The Five Love Languages is a great book for figuring out what makes your wife or husband tick -- at least in five broad areas. The idea is that you read this book and discern the one or two ""love languages"" that you naturally respond to. Then, you share them with your husband or wife so that he or she knows how better to speak to and give in ways that meet your needs.The concept works well with any relationship.My wife and I give a copy to every couple that we know that gets married. It especially helped in a couple who had personalities that were polar opposites in many ways. This helped them to stop talking past each other."
5,Best Read of My Life,"I honestly feel that this book is the best read of my life, because it has taught me so much about relationships and the need in each and everyone of us to feel loved.Chapman is very direct and anecdotal in his style of explaining the 5 Love Languages, and each friend that I have talked to that has read this book has identified with its characters and message in one way or another.I highly recommend this book to each and every person that has a few hours to read it. As author Gary Chapman writes, he hopes that this book can help all of us live a happier life of love by showing us how to express love to those around us better and more sincerely."
5,Great Book,Love the book. Great to share with your boyfriend/girlfriend and helpful in relationships if you are willing to learn and listen
4,Great book for understanding love and the differences,Gary Chapman does a great job of helping me to understand there are different ways in which we love and the definitions or each and how to identify them. He draws from his many years of relationship counseling experiences and uses real stories to relate. It's an easy read and covers the basics in a way that is clear and will allow you to delve deeper into other aspects of relationships and love with a sound foundation to start from. Great book and highly recommended.
5,Excellent book for strengthening relationships,"I went looking for a book that would help two different people communicate when one was an introvert and the other extroverted, and I didn't want an overly religious-minded book. This is a great book that does all that and more - it explains in simple, easy-to-understand terms how to communicate with someone else and how to show them love in a way that they can understand. I'm not engaged or married yet, but it really helped me and my partner understand each other better and learn what ways of showing love would mean something to the other. This is a really good book to read at any stage of the relationship - pre-engagement like us or even 10 years into marriage."
4,This is a really good book!,"I'm about half way done with the book and I'm learning so much from it. This book explains alot of the questions I have about the things my boyfriend does. It's a good book for someone who is looking for answers but, like me, is a little shy to ask.The next step is getting my boyfriend to read it."
1,Unbiblical!,"Is this supposed to be a ""Christian"" book? The bible clearly defines marriage roles: Christ is the head of the husband, the husband is the head of the wife, and the wife is to submit to her husband. If every couple did this, there would be no divorce. It doesn't matter which love language you speak, if you are in rebellion to the Lord and refuse to take the role you were created to fulfill, you will not have a happy marriage. This is a scary book that will put band aids on a lot of miserable situations. If you want to know how to fix your marriage, read the book of Ephesians. Stop being so emotional and take some responsibility for yourself!"
5,Everyone should read this book.,"This is one of the best ""help"" books I have ever read. My husband and I give this book in addition to our friend's wedding gifts. Everyone has loved it. We will try to make it a goal to read once a year."
4,Great for Relationships,"I read this book several years ago and wanted to read it again. I am in a new relationship and I think the concept can provide great insight into making relationships better. The five languages of love are written words, spoken word, acts of kindness, time spent, gifts. Different forms of expression of love mean more to different people. Being conscious of what is important to your partner can make for a better relationship."
5,A MUST HAVE FOR ALL COUPLES,This is by far the best book ever written to help couples communicate their love for one another. It is interesting reading (not that clinical language). I started reading it and couldn't put it down. The ideas it presents are the most common sense ideas that we just sometimes overlook.This book makes a GREAT wedding gift!
3,Short and somewhat obvious,"After reading this book, I'm not sure the author actually accomplished what he set out to do. Yes, there are different forms of communicating, anyone who has been in a long term relationship knows that (or should). But the real difficulty is in learning how to speak (or to listen) in one of the other languages. I'm not sure if this book really addresses the ""How to express"" aspect of the problem in a very usefull way."
3,Stop with the bible quotes,"I'm almost done with this book. It was very insightful. What I did not appreciate was the repetitiveness and the bible quotes. For someone who claims to have studied far and wide, I expected quotes from various texts. I also don't think it's comprehensive enough. For example I like the idea that my significant other will go to the ends of the world for me. He doesn't have to actually do it. Which of the 5 is that?"
5,Great and Helpful,"This book spells things out that are sometimes hard to articulate by oneself. Very helpful, and perfect for any couple who is having trouble and want to make it work."
3,Just OK,"This book is an easy read, but each of the five love languages could be summed up in a page or two instead of a chapter each. Once you read what the languages are and think about them, you are done."
5,It's a great remote control dino set!,"We bought this dino for the whole family.1.This is a great remote control LEGO dino.2.It's a lot of fun to put every piece together to build a remote control dino with your own hands.3.The trick to have it functionally working good is: Remember NOT to put them together too tight, especially the engine parts, just loosen them up a little bit. If you put them together too tight, the dino can not move.4.The dino can roar with its mouth open and closed, and also the dino can walk back and forth, the dino walks pretty fast, seriously this dino even walks more even and faster than the remote control one piece toy dino we got.5.The horns on the back shines in the dark.6.This set also can form a crocodile instead of a dino, but the dino is more complicated.This is one of our favorite LEGO sets."
4,need more sticky effect,"it is helpful..really....my wife says, it makes a big difference, when i sleep.but, this time, when i bought this, i feel that, there should be, some more sticky effect......."
5,"The best Book, no matter how many years in Real Estate!","As a seasoned real estate professional, you sometimes think you know it all, and as a new agent you wish you did. This book has the information to either kick start a new career in real estate, or give you the boost to plan for an early comfortable retirement. Darryl Davis is a powerful speaker, and this book is nothing short of having him speaking directly to you. Read the book several times, you find something new each time! Great Book!! You must have it to streamline your production!"
3,So So,"Lots of info, but much of it is from the 80's. There are much better books out there that are more current and cover more about using social media. Wouldn't recommend it."
2,Better books out there on same material,"If your looking for a quick read that scratches the surface of a lot of real estate basics, you'll like this book. If your looking for something more in depth and detailed, skip this one and go straight to Tom Hopkins ""How to Master the Art of Listing and Selling Real Estate"". I may have enjoyed ""How to Become a Power Agent.."" more if I had not already read the Hopkins book."
3,terrible!,This story full of blood is very terrible. But the author may be lack of skills to describe this thing clearly!
1,IF YOU WANT PIRATE STYLE GO TO JOHNNY DEPP,Dont waste your time. Just watch pirates of the carribean. Johnny Depp rules. And watch Charlie and the Choc Factory too while you're at it. Jordan Fry is hottttttt
1,What a let down...,"As someone who appreciates tales of overcoming childhood abuse, this book was a major let down. Throughout the book, I was waiting for the end chapters to explain the writer's resolution, and means of letting his trauma go. However, this never happened. Therefore, I have a hard time understanding the point of this book. The book ended up seeming more like a pity party, to me, since there really was no part of the journey where the writer ""overcame"" or ""conquered"". I wish I hadn't wasted my time..."
4,"Jesus, my best friend","I bought this book for my brother, a pastor, and have found myself so moved by it that I'll have to get him his own copy. This one's mine! The book really reveals Jesus as a our best friend, our confidant and the one who knows best. In ""The Fisherman,"" Peter frequently resorts to relying on his own instincts but learns that the Master not only has a better way, He has the only way. There's a passage in this book that says Peter knew Jesus as friend first and had to learn that he is Master and Messiah; but that we who know He is Messiah must learn that He's our friend. Beautiful."
5,Must buy!,"This book was an awesome read! I was able to identify with the apostle Peter because the author has a gift for writing you into the story. I highly recommend this book to everyone, young, old, sophisticated, not so sophisticated, girls, boys, women and men!"
4,Funny movie.,"My family really enjoyed the movie when we saw it on TV, and the price was right, so I bought the DVD. I have not had a chance to watch the DVD yet."
3,The suggested remedies require an act of the legislature.,"The suggested remedies almost all require an act of the legislature. The problems derive from the ego and training and self protection habits of the legal profession. The legislature is composed of many lawyers and will not act. Citizen passage of a propositions is essential, part of which will be citizen insistence on citizen review of fees and performance. An uphill fight, which can be won, to the benefit of all.

2,"Ineffective, loud, and makes the room cold","I've had this product for 2 weeks and am about to put it in the trash. (1) We bought it for a room about 300 sq feet and it was never able to raise the humidity level above 35 percent. (2) The filter is designed badly and starts to fall apart after one use. (3) The fan is loud. (4) The fan is too powerful, even on the lowest setting. It blows cold air across the floor at ankle level and causes you to turn up the furnace/heat just to compensate."
5,A Fresh Inspiration!,This book is truly a fresh inspiration to pray in tongues and even more so. Pastor Mahesh gives wonderful insights of how praying in tongues changes your life in the supernatural realm. Things I was not aware of before. It is anointed and will bless any reader!
4,I really liked the convenience and quality of ...,I really liked the convenience and quality of Pepcid tablets. They were very good for the treatment and prevention of heartburn. I'd definitely recommend this product to anyone who suffers from heartburn.
3,"Okay, but not great","This is one of those mildly disturbing books. That aren't a bad read, but you're not likely to read again. It's well written, and enjoyable, but the subject matter is not for young kids."
5,One of her Best,"I've read Deerskin at least four times! I find it extremely interesting and enjoyable. There is a rape scene, which can be disturbing, but isn't as graphic or ""horrible"" as several other books I was required to read in English class. Although I would not recommend this to younger teens, it is a wonderful book for everyone else. My favorite parts are of Lissar in the forest (the first time) and of her caring for the puppies with the prince. I McKinley had contiued the end out a little bit more (I do love love stories)...but I found it fulfilling enough. Read this book...if you like McKinley, then you'll love this book!"
2,I had such high hopes.,"I am a fan of Robin McKinley. I love her thoughtful writing style. That being said, this book is a huge dissapointment. I was bored and a little bit confused. She starts with a compellling if not disturbing tale and ends up wandering al over the place. Move on, not worth owning."
2,Disapointment (2 and a half stars),"Robin McKinley is a favorite of mine but she let me down when I read this book. I dunno maybe I have to read it two or three times to care for it. It could have been worse, maybe i'm being to hard on it, but i didn't care to much of it.It seems like it just goes on and on about it self. it kept climbing to a huge end then it came to it and it wasn't what i was hoping for.This is a story for a more matchure reader, not something I'd go and read to my lil 4 year old cuz. Better for about 13 and up."
4,pulp romance meets fantastic story line,"I've read all of Tami Hoag's books to date. Like most authors she has identified a formula that works. This book took a very large detour into the pulp romance angle of this spellbinding plot. So much so that I almost put it down from the shear boy-meets-girl-sex-attraction overwhelmed the beginning of the novel, like until the second half! But true to form, Ms. Hoag prevents the reader from putting down the book by adding twists and turns, good and evil, and low-and-behold happiness in the end. Would I NOT recommend this book? HAH! We have a talented author here. Her descriptions of the Louisiana swamp, human feelings, intricate plots and suspense prevents panning it. It really is a good read once the reader gets past the pulp romance part. I'm looking forward to her next book to see where she goes from here."
5,A wonderful steamy read,This was the first hardcover book of Tami Hoag's I read and it has made me a lifelong fan. The imagery is startlingly real - you feel as though you could look out a window and see the bayou right outside. And as for Lucky - where can I get one just like him? I have read several other of Tami's novels and I am now a dedicated fan. This book is well worth reading.
5,Oh WOW!!!,"This was my first Tami Hoag book and I must say it was one of the best novels I have ever read. I loved the characters. Serena was tough but scared and she usually ran away from her problems. Lucky was such a tough guy on the outside, but so gentle and kind to Serena and so understanding of her situation. The chemistry between the two was written so well that the sparks actually jumped off the pages. WOW!!I will definitely read more books by Hoag!"
5,Steamy!,"Oh, Yeah....this was the greastest summer read we've found in a long time. Found it at a book store on the Italian Riviera in July '04. Not a serious fan of romance novels, but was intrigued by cover blurb. My daughter and I spent a few sunny days at the beach looking for ""Lucky"" in every man we met. Also we're from Southwest Louisiana and it kind of brought a bit of home to us. Loved it, loved it. There will never be another Lucky. BTW, I am 65 yrs old and my daughter is 40ish."
2,Is this a porno or a mystery?,"This has got to be one of the worst books I have ever read. Totally not in the same league as most other Hoag novels. The so-called ""suspense"" plot (which is boring with a predictable ending) takes a backseat to the many explicite sex scenes between the 2 main characters. I found myself wondering if this was the first book Hoag had ever written."
2,Just another turn-bad movie screenplay!,"What happen here is a book that the author claimed to have at least 10 years research but definitely fell short since he could only get all the information from two books, not even could have the opportunity to copy some information from the out of print MEGALODON in 1983 and QUEST FOR MEGALODON published in 199? What kind of research is this? I totally agree to the comments from a great reader of gdeshazo@juno.com and only wish I could say better. I also have to say that the KIRKUS REVIEW OF 4/15/97 shown above, is a very stupid review. Because the reviewer has almost told the whole detailed story for this try-to-be-in-depth, single-minded book! We don't need a reviewer to dump us any book with the whole 9 yards. This kind of review could only make a simple story look even simpler and worse"
3,such promise!,"great idea for a story....the science of the megaladon staying alive in the heated waters in so cool especially the idea of the blood of a dying meg allowing another to swim the cold waters to the surface and go on a killing rampage...the main character is someone who you can really get behind and are proud of when he proves he is right...the ending gets cheesy.... though the rest of the action in the novel is on par with other thrillers....the end leaves open the possibility for a sequel (which was written), and is cool how the doctor knows what kind of shark it is by its eyes, and it is a baby meg....too cool...haven't read the sequel yet because i've been warned against it, but i may anywaythis is one of those books that should have been turned into a movie and wasn't...take away the fantasy of a mini-sub going into a massive shark's body, and this book was believable and fun...its like jaws with a science background"
2,"Meg - the book, not the shark - plumbs the depths","There's little point repeating the criticism already set out here by so many who disliked the book. What depresses me is the attitude of those who say, in effect, ""so what if its trash, that's all I want for my in-flight reading."" As Emerson said: ""People don't deserve good writing, they're too happy with the bad."""
2,"Repeatious, sensational, no depth in characters really...","I enjoyed reading most of the book...I read it in a day or two. I'm not a writer, editor, or a critic, but it seems that Alton was either writing ""down"" to his readers or he wrote the book in pieces and forgot that he'd already shared the same information 3 or 4 times earlier in the book. We aren't stupid! I guess it seemed that he might have been shooting for a certain number of pages and so he had to fill the pages up with repeated statistics and charaters one liners that required no thought, only fowl language. Real character development is not formed in that way. I think it was good for a first book. Better then I'd do that's for sure, but this is a world market....not to deep, but if you aren't looking for deep it's great :-)"
2,"been there, done that",We've seen it all before. Jaws and Jurassic Park already told the story. The charaters were about as one-dimensional as they could get. I wonder what other junk Doubleday will put on the shelf.
1,The only terror in this book is that it got published!,"Man oh man what a dog! I read this book with a sense of amazement that grew with each terribly written page. A word of advice for those sadomasochistic readers who liked it. Maybe it's time to get some therapy. And now I hear the sequal ""Sire"" was rejected by Doubleday(Gee, what a surprise after how ""Meg"" tanked at the bookstores)and Alten is suing them. Classy book, classy guy."
3,Watch out for that shark!,"This book surprised me. I was actually somewhat entertained although my imagination had to reach in some parts....cutting the shark's heart with a tooth from the inside? Un-huh... Gotcha. Felt like some serious Hollywoodism going on. Although I found the writing a tad on the juvenile side in the beginning, it seemed to improve over the remainder of the novel. Bonus, it's short! I was done in one sitting. Let's just say, I was entertained enough to go out and purchase the sequel... I'll let you know later how that one went!"
3,"360 pages in 5.5 hours, no sweat, no fear, no mercy","Yes, this book held my interest for the whole 9.5 yards, even the ending was OK. It has a lot of speed (almost redefines it with its time and location jumps). The flap says Crichton meets Benchley, this says it all, scientific driven action with weak characters blah blah meets Jaws. And with every chaos science thriller a la Jurasic Park, all you can do is marvel at the ingenious ways and methods the body count-down is handled (I liked the bitchy-wife-gets-eaten-scene best... does this say something about my psyche?. Hey Steve, you could have topped that with our hero meeting his wife in the fish) I gave it only a three star rating because of the fact that the hero lays the girl without any effort and psychological foreplay, that always makes me envious and insecure - how do these hero types do it? Anyway, a good read, maybe NOT for the beach but a Ski-hut."
2,Meg should be a made for TV movie of the week!,"While I was overjoyed in finding a book in the bookstore that combines both my favorite films, Jaws and Jurassic Park, Mr. Alten should have never bothered publishing the book. It's slow and tedious at the beginning with so much ""fake"" scienctific jargon it almost crawls off the pages! If people honestly feel this book will sell like hotcakes on the big screen I think they are in for a big suprise! How big of a success was ""The Lost World"" after Jurassic Park? Not a big one so why should this be? Sounds like another sequel to Jaws. Give it up already."
4,I'd recommend this book to everyone who likes to be suprised,"I think this book is written with a lot of creativity behind it. It's about a giant, prehistoric great white shark who lives down in the deepest part of the ocean, known as the Challenger Deep. After a freak accident the female somehow swam to the surface and now the Navy will do everything to stop it. This book is a great book if you like suprise and action. Basically the whole book will keep you thinking. The book is put together very well and everything comes together and makes sense. You won't be confused at all when you finish, and to me that is a very good thing. Once again I would recommend this book to all who like action and suspence."
4,Exciting and suspenceful!!!!,An exciting and fast paced novel with a distinctive flavor for suspence. Theme is a possibility for those who believe that the unexplored areas of this world still hold secrets. A must for those who live by the ocean....
3,"Simplistic, somewhat inaccurate, but interesting","Having met the author at The Sharktooth Festival in Venice, FL on 8/15/99, I enjoyed reading his first novel, and I will certainly read his second as well. However, two things occurred to me while reading the book. First, the plot seemed somewhat simplistic. By that I mean that all the critical events happened right on schedule, such as finding the Meg on the first exploratory dive. I began to imagine seeing the NBC logo on the bottom right of my TV screen indicating that this was sanitized for tv audiences. My main objection, being a PADI Scuba instructor, was reading that oxygen was used in the scuba tanks instead of plain old compressed air. Oxygen at depth will kill a diver; scuba equipment uses only compressed air. Every scuba diver who reads this book will know that the author wasn't alerted to this inconsistancy."
3,a fun read,"The reviews link this book to Jurassic park. That makes sense. Its not over filled with science, but enough to make it believable. The charactors are not developed but the action is entertaining. Its a decent Beach novel."
3,"I love shark/monster books/movies, and this one is fun!","I enjoyed reading it when it came out two years ago. I may have enjoyed it more if not for the pain killers I was on for my wisdom teeth removal. I hope to read TRENCH the sequel soon. It is a fast read, with plenty of ""novice-style"" writing, but I have faith in Steve. He's an underdog, judging by an article I read. And he's local as well (Florida). I hope Disney can make a good movie, though I know they're waiting on the results from DEEP BLUE SEA. I think I can speak for all of us when I say we NEED another shark movie!"
4,"Perfect blend of action,fear and desperation.","Alten perfectly blends action,curiosity,fear, and desperation. He puts you in the situation of trying to rid the world of a killer shark's 60 foot long ancestor.If you thought Jaws was scary you should read this pulse-pounding novel."
3,"Great story, not too thrilled by ending!!","I just finished reading MEG and all I can say is WOW!!! Great story, lots of action, really keeps you going. This was a much better book than EXTINCT by Charles Wilson (which gets 2 stars). I just ordered the sequel (The Trench). The reason I am giving this only 3 stars out of 5 was the ending. I won't go into detail for those who have not read it, and by all means do so, but I thought the ending could have been better. Keep the coming Mr Alten, you have Peter Benchley beat by a mile!"
3,Good Premise But Corny,I admit that I was entertained by this book I have always been facinated by sharks especially the Megaladon and I was very excited to come across this book. the story for me was a cool trip but the characters were like cardboard and I did not feel any sympathy for them and then there is the utterly ridiculous ending thatg had me laughing out loud!
3,More a Summer Movie treatment than a novel.,"Steve Alten's novel Meg reads more like the novelization of a Summer Event Picture that, in the wake the American Godzilla debacle, just didn't get around to happening. But I didn't expect much in the character department anyway, I just wanted a lot of scenes of a giant shark ripping boats and people to shreads. I got what I wanted."
4,Action-filled and Exciting,"I read his second book before his first one, so I was anxious to read the first. I have a special interest in sharks and have swum with them, so this book was almost doomed to be enjoyable before I read it. In spite of this, it fully lived up to my expectations."
2,Alten has potential,"MEG is like a big budget summer movie. Awesome action, one dimensional characters, absurd ending. Fun to watch, but easily forgettable. The story is pretty good, a megaladon has survived in the Mariana Trench and surfaces for predictable mayhem. The hero, Jonas Taylor has to stop it somehow despite being surrounded by people who simply refuse to believe how dangerous the creature is. (Very realistic, I know I wouldn't think that a 50 FOOT LONG Great White Shark could be more than an inconvenience!) Despite the incompetence of pretty much all the supporting characters, Jonas triumphs over the Meg. A fun, light read. Alten could go from decent writer to great writer if he would learn to develop his characters a little more and tone the drama of his endings down!"
3,"Same Story, Different Shark","What's bigger than a Great White Shark? A Megalodon. What's a faster read than a Benchley novel? Meg. What will make you think you've read this before? Meg.Althought the story is very similiar to JAWS, the book is enjoyable and fast-reading. For the newer generation of readers who have not read JAWS, this novel will make you look forward to the author's next book.On the whole, the book was okay"
4,A better version of Jaws,"I read this book a number of years ago, and just now re-stumbled across it. Like previous reviewers said, it's a fast paced action novel, and I very much enjoyed it because it combines good fiction with ichthyoloy, which I very much enjoy.When I first read this book about eight or nine years ago it got me interested in megaladons, which in turn got me interested in studying ichthyology, which I had very much fun studying for years after reading this book.I don't know of any other books to compare it too but Jaws, and this is much better than any of the Jaws books. If you like sharks and fun books, this is definitely one you should check out.Overall grade: A-"
1,Got time to burn? Bored? This is the book for you.,"I was stuck in an airport waiting for a delayed flight and in desperation for something to do picked up Meg. Oh dear. A note to anyone else who comes up with a great idea for a novel but can't write very well: Do research and get help. If you're going to write a book that's going to increase shark paranoia and contribute to having even more sharks senselessly slaughtered then at least do a good job. I was less offended by the high school writting style as I was the lack of and/or inacuracy of detail. Adding insult to injury was the statement at the back of the book that research had been done. Come on - who are we trying to kid? To his credit Alten didn't include the standard sex sceen. But hey, if you need a book you can finish in 5 hours and not have to take very seriously, this is the book for you!"
1,"Get em, Meg! Get em!!!",May Meg eat this author and all other authors who rip us off for twenty some dollars! What a sham! Swim for your life....away from Meg
1,Bigger is NOT Better!,"I'll admit, MEG occupied my time and gave me mild amusment, but come-on! A giant shark glowing deamon shark is unleashed upon the unsuspecting world. oh-no! Bum,Bum,Bummmmm!!! Hasn't this been done before!?!(i.e. Jaws) Let me just say, bigger is not better in this case. I mean what can I say? ...First, its a takeoff of a classic book (Jaws), just enlarging the villian and down sizeing the characters. Second, like I just said the characterization is horrible! I didn't like any of the characters, none where deep in anyway. I'll give it to Alten, he tried to make Jonas's terror of the sharks real but realistically you could predict this book like a bad summer movie. Third, the ending! Arggg! It made me hate this book! Don't read MEG, unless your in the mood for a bad summer movie script. MEG isn't a novel of deep terror..."
2,Disapointed on the suspense,I was very disapointed with the suspense in this book. A lot of exageration of a 60 foot shark that can propel itsel out of water and hit a helicopter. That it can crush a submarine and that the hero destroys it by being inside and removing the heart.
3,Dinosaur Shark on the prowl!!!,"Good story but pretty much typical. Like Jaws, only bigger,whiter and more dangerous. My favorite chapter was the one with the surfers--well-written with humor and adventure. I wish more of the chapters had been like this and that the character of Jonas was a little more developed. But I did like the play on his name (like Jonah swallowed by the whale in the Bible)."
3,Pick Up The Paperback Instead,"I love this book. So why did I give it 3 stars? This isn't the Meg I know and love. It's been rewritten and ""fleshed out"" as the author has put it, to make it more interesting for a movie. Pardon me? Meg was fine the way it was. Why it needed ""fleshing out"" (read some of the characters backstories got complete overhauls) is beyond me.That said, pick up the original 1997 hard cover or paperback. In that case...If you were a fan of Jaws back in the day, you'll love Meg. This prehistoric shark puts Jaws to shame. Yes, Jaws was a written way back when, but Alten puts the science behind the behavior of sharks. With enough action to sink a ship, enough blood and guts to satisfy anybody with a gory side, and just enough believability to make you wonder what's lingers in the deepest recesses of our oceans you'll have a hard time putting down Meg."
3,"This is a fun Jaws-type novel, but don't look for depth.","Alton borrows HEAVILY from Benchley and Crichton for this novel. It is fast paced, fun and even a bit scary at times, but I didn't not find myself caring too much about the characters. Overall, it was somewhat predictable (with an escape that is nothing short of silly)."
4,The next Blockbuster hit!!!!!,Greatest book I've read all summer! Very exciting and nerve racking...you never know what the Meg will do next! I couldn't put it down! Definately worth your time!
1,Was this bad? Most definitely.,"The only redeeming qualities of this book were the large print and short plot. Even though the story had lots of action, the plot was terrible, the allusions to the bible were trite, uninteresting, and far from thought provoking, and the similarity to Jaws was all too present. Further, while the story may have some scientific basis, as a whole the plot was unbelievable. I do not recommend this book."
3,Entertaining book with an amazing climax,Meg requires suspension of logic in more than one place however the book is certainly entertaining.A 60- Foot prehistoric shark on the loose? Think Sharkzilla!
2,"Good premise, not well written","This book at first seems like a very exciting, tense novel. And indeed, it is. However, the writing of the novel itself pales very much in comparison to other great books of its type like Jaws and Jurassic Park. The cookie cutter characters are very shallow and predictable, and the plot is very far fetched. The book is very rushed and does not bother to explain the concepts in the story. And although it is not supposed to be a factual book, the novel is also painfully inaccurate and sensational when it comes to the protagonist itself. it would be easy for this book to mislead readers, and I would not recommend it. If you're looking for a shark book to entertain you, this one is a flop. Pick something like Jaws instead."
4,Oklahoma's Depression Outlaw,"Sid Underwood has written a very good and well deserved account of the life of Oklahoma's depression era bandit, who has previously been overshadowed by Bonnie and Clyde. True, Raymond Hamilton ran with Bonnie and Clyde, but his crimes were extreme and his life ended in prison. Underwood's book is very readable and will last as a true crime classic."
4,Most fun I've had reading in ages,"I'm not a huge fan of traditional epic fantasy, I get bored by coming of age and lost heir stories and I hate talking animals, but I really enjoyed this book.This is the sort of story you miss when you finish.The only reason that I didn't give it five stars is that I found the ending a little cluttered and several places in the book, mostly early on, I found the writer's rotation of names and pronouns confusing. It was hard to tell who was speaking in conversations with more than three people. That's an editing error so it's an easy fix and I would never tell anyone to let that keep you away from such a wonderful story.I'm looking forward to more adventures set in this universe."
5,Wonderful Book,"Charles Slack is a wonderful reporter, and this engaging book illuminates a fascinating chapter in American history. But what raises this book above mere reportage is the profound sympathy the author evokes for all the story's characters, from Goodyear's long-suffering and enigmatic wife, Clarissa, to his chief rival Thomas Hancock. Even the scoundrel Horace Day is fully drawn rather than treated like a mere two-dimensional villain. This is a wise book, and Goodyear's singleminded mission to solve the riddle of ""gum-elastic"" is an inspiring and much needed reminder that it's usually not greed that motivates the very greatest entrepreneurs and inventors."
1,COME ON!!!!!!!!,"This doll is WAY too goth! I mean, PIRATES?!?!? COME ON PEOPLE! HAVE YOU USED UP ALL YOUR IDEAS AND ALL YOU CAN THINK OF IS PIRATES?!?!?!?!?! I love bratz but this is a total insult. PPPPPPPPPPPLLLLLLLLLLLEEEEEEEEEZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZ!"
4,"not bad, easy system","This book starts out simple and builds on itself as you progress. It covers a broad range of med terms, with about 30 pages in each chapter and a good end of chapter review with different types of quizzes. The CD is also by chapter and has games to test you and also an area you can listen to the vocab words for pronunciation. My ""plastic comb"" version (not the spiral bound for more $) is falling apart after 2 semseters of use though."
3,Got it for free - good if it is free!,"Got it with my Samsung 570V. 1.7W is good for nothing (unless added cosmetic value to your LCD). I combine it with my stereo system (70W speaker) as rear speakers. Turns out to be not too bad. When I watch DVD/play music, they act as the front speaker (treble & mid range.Good for personal use in a dorm/apt where you can't play too loud either."
3,nice-looking but flimsy,"This viaduct set looked like it could be fun, and looked good on our train table. However, the plastic was so flimsy that the pieces would not sit flat, either on the table or when stacked. I ordered the Thomas viaduct instead and this is much nicer--worth the extra money. It doesn't stack like this viaduct set, but what does it matter if the stacking doesn't work. This toy has so much potential--would be good if the makers can improve its quality and therefore its stability."
4,buy with confidence,"'My own jo ellen' is the first release i've heard from mark since leaving the jayhawks,its a peach.i aint one who normally compares one album to another, but mark being such a major force in the jayhawks its hard not to,if you can imagine 'blue earth'with the production or 'hollywood town hall'wouldnt be too far off the mark.if you are a fan of any of the first four jayhawks albums,you simply can not miss out on this.there is one dud track (that i wont name incase of denting ones subconcious) that does not hold up with the tempo,but on its own is still worth a listen.'walking through nevada'left me with the same feel as 'crowded in the wings'from 'hollywood...' and rosalee wouldnt go out of place on golden smog's 'down on the old mainstream'.suprisingly 'my own jo ellen'has turned out to be as essential as ryan adams 'heartbreaker'.alt country fans should definitely check this out,and also great music lovers."
5,Fascinating historical detective study of a hidden world,"This superb book offers a fascinating exploration of the hidden world of heresies, sects and cults in late antique and medieval Europe and the Middle East. It is a must reading for everyone interested in the clandestine or esoteric trends in European and Middle eastern religious history; it reveals multitudes of novel insights into European religious development and a wealth of new data about sectarian, cultic and clandestine groups and their history. Compellingly narrated, it will please the most demanding readers and has a telling relevance for a number of new sectarian and esoteric trends in modern religion in Europe, USA, Asia, etc. Critical reading for all lovers of historical, religious and esoteric mysteries"
5,Everything you hear today can be traced back to Richard,Richard Pryor is the funniest man on the face of the earth.
2,Need a very stable table.,It takes some time to get the knack of it.A slight bump of the table can ruin the play.Not a game I would recommend.
2,I Hope Forza ships soon....,"I only bought this because I really like racing games and there just isn't much out there for the 360. I shouldn't have, not much to add that hasn't been said in previous posts, just wanted to get my rating in and hopefully save someone else $60.00"
2,okay,More of a love story than anything else. He writes well enough that you can suspend your disbelief that it's a talking bear. Only okay book.
3,"Works well, buy two","I use this mount to hold my Sirius receiver. It works well and it's very easy to install. I only gave it three stars because it breaks too easily. This is the third one that I have bought. The heads of the first two broke off at the point where they attached to the gooseneck arm. I haven't found a better solution, and these mounts are <$20 so I keep buying them. Consider buying a second one in case they are unavailable when (not if) yours breaks."
3,Ok But How Do You Edit Numbers!,NBA 2K6... its pretty good but one gripe HOW DO YOU EDIT PLAYERS NUMBERS?! I did a fantasy draft and had a bunch of guys with the same number so the cpu automatically gave them new numbers. stephon marbury is number 98 and andrew bogut is number 67 and i dont like it it makes the game feel somewhat fake. does anyone know how to do this?
1,Save your money,"A 11year old book that is little more than a tour guide of 500 lakes through out the country. On the bodies of water listed that I am personally familiar, the info was dated, as well as either inaccurate or written by someone who had never been to the lake but rather called the local tackle shop for info. BTW. The tackle shop refered on one particular lake never existed. At least not by the name given.Better bet. Check your local fish and game department for current and up to date info on the particular lake you are interested in."
5,Miller has done it again,"Corbin's Fancy is about another of the great Corbin son's. With Miller's usual Humor, romance and intrigue this story will be one of your favorites for years to come."
4,Corbin's Fancy,A great read that be read a little at a time - or all in one stretch. The interaction between the characters (not just the leading ones) is great. I especially enjoy a book when all the characters have a 'piece of the action' and I can get to know the personality of other people than the hero and heroine.
1,Not up to her usual Quality but its a reprint,"This book is a reprint of one of her earlier books, and if the entire series is the same I am glad I found out before buying them. Hardly 10 pages goes by without oral sex one way or the other, followed immediately by a fight of some sort that leads to a repeat of the same. Very thin story developement and her characters are not as richly fleshed out as books in the Stone Creek series or the McKettrick series. They at least were an enjoyable read. This book, without the explicit sex would be about 20 pages long, and the entire story could have fit in 1 chapter."
5,Love at its finest!,"I am an avid reader of all types of genre. I am also an avid gardener. This novel has meshed the love of gardening with the true emotions of a loving relationship between two individuals. When reading this, you felt fully embraced in their journey. Their passion for each other was transferred to the garden as well. I have given this book to all of my friends, each of whom has cried and praised it. It is one of the most touching, picturesque books I have ever read. I would like to read more of this style."
3,Actually not too bad,"When I picked up this book, I said to myself, ""Bah, this will be garbage"", but it being about Drizzt, I had to take a look. I was extremely surprised to find it wasn't all that bad.I will say though (as I've said before) nobody should do Drizzt except for Salvatore"
5,An epic if I've ever seen one!,"I'm a fan of Mr. Alten's work, but my exposure to his writing, up until the point I got this book, mainly consisted of the Meg novels, so I was a little wary about this book.I wasn't disappointed.Mr. Alten paints such a vivid picture in this selection. He has no trouble taking the reader all over the world, from the U.S. to Scotland... and, boy, he does the Loch Ness legend great justice with the story itself.I recommend ""The Loch"" to any reader who likes an action-packed story with great scenery, fleshed out characters and twists and turns in every chapter.A fascinating read!"
3,"Good premise, but...","The book's premise is a good one, and I was enthralled after reading the first few chapters. It is a little heavy on the tech details and I did skim over some of the overdone Scottish dialogue. Then, about 3/4 of the way through (after trying to force myself to read more than a few lines per page so I could get the book over with) I had to stop reading it. Mr. Alten is not much for flushing out personal relationships...Zach's first girlfriend? That scenario was ridiculous. And in my opinion Brandy was made to be so unlikable that I was hoping she would fall off of her boat and Zack would date the vet. I think the point where I had to stop was Brandy's out-of-nowhere reconciliation with her father that was annoying in its brevity and the feeling that it was stuck in there to smooth over plot lines. I appreciated the book for its premise and research, but aside from the science of it the writing at times felt amateurish, pointless and utterly predictable."
5,Great,This book was a really good read. I couldn't put it down no matter how hard I tried. My mom would get mad at me for staying up past 1 am to read it. Would recomend to anyone. Would read again!
4,"Much, Much Better for Alten","Alten took the world by storm with Meg, giving him an instant movie deal and profiles everwhere from People to USA Today.Then he had trouble following up.He tried some sci-fi esque works, such as Domain, which just came across as hollow and cliched. He gave us a Meg sequel (two, but I've yet to read the third) which just felt like a rehash.Here, though, he tries something new. And succeeds. He gives us much more interesting characters, perhaps cliches themselves but entertaining ones. He gives them more danger, more interesting action, and side plots that make sense. And, while there's obviously no real Loch Ness Monster, Alten reasonably deals with all the fakes and frauds, coming up with a perfect explanation for it all.The only knock is that Alten sometimes gets a bit juvenile. Brief discussions of sex seem out of left field and a notch below the rest of the summer-time-reading intelligence level."
4,I'm adding Alten to my list of favorite authors,"This is the first Steve Alten book I've read. I'm thoroughly hooked! I loved his writing style and the fast-paced nature of this book. Plenty of action, a little romance and intrigue, lots of Scotland detail that helps to root the reader in each page, and even a good amount of history.My only complaints were petty ones - first, some of the names were spelled differently throughout the book (Cialiano vs Cialino, Northsaur vs. Nothsaur) and it irked me when I read through it that spellings varied so often from page to page. Also, the sheer size of the book makes it awkward. It's not your typical paperback-sized book, so when you're in the first or last 50 pages, it's hard to hold upright without it flopping over. Due to the number of pages I'm sure it had to be printed this way to keep it from being 800 pages, but I found it cumbersome to hold.Overall, I loved The Loch, and will be on the lookout for more Alten books!"
3,Needs Polishing,"This book would be a lot better if it had been edited worth a damn. Aside from the monster swimming in the loch, the book is also swimming with punctuation errors. Maybe the writer is actually a bright guy, but it doesn't seem like it when he can't tell the difference between a period and a question mark, which are thrown willy-nilly all over the book. The story itself was a decent B-rate summer monster story, but nothing special. The science was actually not half bad, but the characters were all walking cliches, and the female characters were abnormally abrasive."
3,A Camp Classic,"This book is an absolute riot--a camp classic!The plot line is silly, to call the characters cardboard would be an insult to that substantial material, and the dialogue (minstrel-show Scots burrs included) is cringe-inducingly awful.But Mr. Alten does know how to pump up an exciting scene, and this book is so intoxicated with its own energy and sheer awfulness that it sweeps you along, and is great fun to read.I'll give Mr. Alten the benefit of the doubt as far as this book goes--I can't help wondering if he intended for it to be this campy and over-the-top. Either way, it certainly is fun.Book: 1 star for quality; 5 stars for fun; averages out to 3 stars"
1,"This is a Blackberry case, not for Nokia E61",Feels like bait and switch. This case is for the Blackberry and not the Nokia as described. I know because my friend's Blackberry fit perfectly. My Nokia E61i did not fit in the case properly. I did get it in by smashing the case flat first but the fit was so tight that removing it was quite difficult and impossible while wearing it on a belt. I would return it but the shipping cost was more than the product so I'd only get back about $1 after all my shipping costs.
3,Some Pros and Cons,"There are both some strong points and weak points to this book. The author excels in reviewing the historic origins of libertarian free. His historic and philosophical overviews are very informative and helpful. Yet, his review of biblical Calvinistic position is lacking and incomplete. He fails to mention some essential points in presenting the 5 points of Calvinism and is not written in a very understandable style. Overall, the author's writing is somewhat choppy and lacking cohesiveness. The last chapter seems out of place and rushed, not giving clear explanations of the issues raised. It appears as if the author was attempting to fit another book into one chapter. If a reader desires a good historic overview of the Armenian/Calvinism debate, this book is a good choice. If the reader is looking for a well written presentation and defense of the 5 points of Calvinism, I recommend ""The Reformed Doctrine of Predestination"" by Loraine Boettner."
4,jumpstart mini trampoline,"My granddaughter really has been enjoying her time spent jumping! The package was a little messed up when we received it, but seemed to be ok after putting it together. Shipping must have been a little ""ROUGH"". She will put this product to good use when she isn't able to get outside, rainy weather days, or this winter. Did receive it in a timely manner and had it for her party."
1,Read before buying,"This is a terrible product. My daughter who is 30 pounds loved this toy, but after two months, the band broke and she fell and hurt herself. We thought maybe it was just a bad part. The company send us another band, and sure enough it broke again after 3 months. This time my daugter hurt her foot. This toy is very dangerous. Please be careful if you buy this. Remember she is only 30 pounds and she is not near the weight limit of 80 pounds."
3,"Great, bungee broke after 8 months","As many other people have reported, the bungee broke after awhile. My kids received this as a gift last Christmas, and the bungee broke in ~6 months.It's too bad because the kids loved it. I'm glad noone was hurt when it broke. For the liability, you'd think the company would make sure these things are durable.Worse, the company doesn't seem to exist. Impossible to contact them and I've only found 1 place online that sells a replacement bungee. Of course, I also expect that the replacement bungee won't last any longer than the original.Great idea, poor durability, perhaps even dangerous if the bungee breaks at the wrong time.."
2,Not for me....,"The story was not horrible and I could see other readers enjoying it. I do not enjoy H that repeatedly tell the h that they do not love them or that they never will love them. I just do not see this as romantic at all. It wouldn't have bothered me as much had it not lasted almost the entire book but the H did not actually voiced his love until almost the last chapter. Ofcourse the h is so relieved that all is well. If it doesn't bother you to thave the h constantly put her heart out for the H only to have it crushed repeatedly, you might enjoy the book. I did enjoy the daughters in the story but could not get past why anyone would want to beg to be loved as much as this h did."
4,Surprisingly good,"I thought this was going to be an in your face romance but there are some really good plot lines in here. I loved the daring, darling, disastrous prone daughters-they really kept the story moving."
4,A great quick read. I feel lucky to have found it!,"If you are looking for a funny/romantic/interesting/smart read for a Saturday, this is the book for you. I'd recommend starting it on a Friday or Saturday, because once you start reading it, you won't be able to put it down.The characters are loveable right from the start. There's a widower with 3 ornery daughters (""The McBride Menaces"" as they are known about town) who never wants to marry again. An independent, stubborn dressmaker who has loved said widower since she first laid eyes on him. A crazy, superstitious rancher. A never-ending parade of housekeepers. And a long-lost twin brother.All those characters add up to a rich, full story you are sure to enjoy. :)"
2,Bad luck wedding dress,"Maybe it's the timeframe. Not really interested in western settings. I couldn't finish thus book. Found the premise inane, characters uninspired and dull. Not worth the time."
3,Convenient but Small,I guess I was disappointed by the small size of paints. This product won't last very long if you're in the facepainting business.
2,Not quite what I expected,"The device is only ok. My biggest problem is that the picture is misleading. The arm does not bend and is actually completely straight, which means that it won't fit in my application. If the arm was flexible (or even rigid but bent as the picture shows) then I would have been happy with it..."
3,Okay for a Subaru,"It seems to stay well in the cupholder of an 05 subaru outback, but similarly to another review, in the front it somewhat blocks the gearshift (manual), and in the back one it blocks the armrest somewhat.... Jury is still out as to whether I want to hold my arm up while I'm shifting.Otherwise, it was very easy to install and seems to stay in well. Simple, solid design."
1,I never got it,"Less than a week before Christmas, my money was refunded for this item and it was never sent. I had ordered TWO, and they were my kids' big Christmas presents!! I had to go out and find something else for them that close to Christmas. I'm considering never using Amazon again because of it. What a hassle!"
3,Virtual Dog,"This product arrived quickly and was as described. The game is fun because you have a portable hand held game where you interact with a dog. You get to pick the type of dog, name it, and then interact with it. You can take the dog for walks, feed it, giv it water, let it sleep, play tricks and other things. It's nice because kids can learn some responsibilities - like remembering to care for the dog and take it for walks. The hand held unit then connects to the game console so you can hook it up to a TV - which allows for a much easier view. The console runs on C batteries. I believe the hand held unit which is the game itself runs on AAA batteries. The big downside is the screen is hard to see on the portable hand held unit - so hooking it up to the TV allows the game to be played much easier. Overall it is not a bad product at all - especially given the price."
3,bored before long.....,"I bought this for my ten year old daughter for Christmas. She could not stop playing with it for about a month, now it just sits there. I guess you do the same stuff over and over and it doesnt change. She ops to play with the pc or game cube more. Does teach about taking care of a pet though. Also do not like that fact that it is all battery operated. I would prefer a plug."
1,An Anti-Ecumenical Book,"The labeling on this book is deceptive. It very plainly states in the book that this is an anti-ecumenical work but this does not show up in any of the book descriptions. It is not ""only"" against New Age. It makes some interesting points but on the whole I would not have spent my money on it if I had had any real idea of its content."
5,Uncle Usagi!,"Leaving the temple at Kitanoji, Usagi Yojimbo and his ""nephew"" Jotaro travel in the hopes of strengthening their relationship, as well as having Jotaro learn more about becoming a warrior in ways that Katsuichi-sensei cannot teach.They meet some Usagi's old friends, and Jotaro learns much about the world after leaving the seclusion of his (and Usagi's) sensei.But in typical Sakai fashion, we aren't treated with light, happy-go-lucky stories. Jotaro immediately comes to experience the evil permeating the realms of the outside world; but with his head hard and his honorable (and also hard-headed) ""uncle,"" he learns fast about the rough life ahead for those destined to become samurai.Great storytelling, beautiful illustrations, and deep characters--all the product of another great Sakai meisterstueck."
2,You get what you pay for.,"This is a very cheap product and this is how it performs. The mouth guard fell off on the first use, and the reservoir never sealed perfectly. But the biggest problem is that when running, the Alterra really messes up your stride. It is advertised as a running hydration pack but it is COMPLETELY unsuitable for this. It would work well for hiking or maybe biking (I didn't try this), but DO NOT buy it for running!"
4,Useful collection of classic screenplays.,The screenplays in this collection range from golden age to relatively modern. They include:All Quiet on the Western FrontMeet John DoeCasablancaMiracle on 34th StreetRebel Without a CauseBonnie and ClydeThe GraduateButch Cassidy and the Sundance KidSounderOn Golden PondArthurThe CandidateIt's also worth reading for the very entertaining and useful foreward by Frank Capra. Beware of only one thing: the typeface in this book is very tiny and takes some getting used to.Worthwhile book for students of film and screenwriting.
1,Disappointing and Unrevealing,"After reading a copy of this book, my friend purchased, I am completed unimpressed with the level of intellect Mr. Byrd presents to today's savy American society. His thoughts and words compare to that of a toddlers expected ranting and raving over being told no. And when I now think logically about what I expected to get out of this book, I guess I was aiming a bit high for the author."
1,High price for campaign literature,"Sentaor Byrd objects to arrogance? I thought it was his profession. Here at all events is some campaign literature you have to pay for, which is a nice free market touch. Judged by poster standards, it seems a little unbalanced. For the record: George W. did not seek out the war on terror (until Islamic terrorism declared war on us, he was a remarkably ""domestic"" president); the newly released 9/11 Commission report is generally in favor of the measures of the Patriot Act; France (the epicenter of the famous ""unraveling"") has a tradition of irresponsible and self-serving meddling in the Near East since the early 1960's (really the 1920's).All in all, it is astonishing how superannuation can give the narrowest and most partisan pol a reputation for ""wisdom"" and ""stature."""
4,a good legal argument about the bush administration,"I am a conservative who read this book to try to understand all the hatred aimed at, my perception of, a great president. Robert Byrd is a well respected, well spoken senator with years of experience. His personal politics are moderate even though his rhetoric tends to border on Howard Dean insanity. This book provides a good legal assement at how the president has grabbed power and manipulated it to achieve his agenda. Whether you agree with his agenda is a different story. I think the good senator makes a strong argument and his knowledge of history and practical experience make for a insightful read. The important part of politics is to stay informed. The Left and Right both provide sound arguments for why they do what they do. Stay informed, read good books (like this one), and vote. I live in West Virginia and plan on voting for Byrd until his death, the man is vital to this economic-lack-luster state."
5,A must have!,"Mathieu Dufour, principal flute of the Chicago Symphony Orchestra since 1999, gives a superb version of the Prokofiev, Martinu and Hindemith sonatas that is a pleasure to hear. All these pieces are technically challenging, but this French flutist makes them sound easy, reaching a high level full of musicality and touching sound. Aleksandar Madzar also gives a very precise and powerful performance at the piano, that many times is as demanding as the flute part.Dufour in this CD truly gives a breath of fresh air to the flute repertoire. Highly recommended!!I hope we can enjoy new productions or releases from this artist in the near future."
2,Dead already,"One day I got it out of the closet to ship a bunch of books, and it was completely dead. It simply didn't come on with wall power or batteries. When I opened it up, I smelled burnt electronics -- the controller board was fried. Not surprising, since it looks like a very cheap board...the capacitors and transistors were bent every which way. I don't ship much, so I got maybe 3 uses out of the thing total.Unsurprisingly, I'm unsatisfied with this item."
3,does not comes with battery or power cord,"I just added the Myweight ultraship to my basket after many research comparing prices and realize it doesn't come with the power cord. Then after adding the cord in the basket and realize (just before ""place order"") that the shipping for the cord is more then the cost of the cord. What kind of a company that sells a piece of electronic that required a power cord and not provides it.!!!warning!!!that this unit does not come with power cord and the cord cost 3.99 plus shipping 4.17 = the total of $8.17 additional plus the cost of the scale"
1,Five star rating ???,We bought two of these - both died within two months. I am surprised by the high rating this junk is getting on Amazon.
5,A great little scale!,I love this little scale! It's small enough to store anywhere when not in use. The detachable face is nice for weighing bulky items that would otherwise cover the screen. It's extremely easy to use and the large digital display is easy on the eyes. You can even choose the unit of measurement you want.4/28/11 Update: after nearly 2 years of heavy use this scale is holding up wonderfully. I use it to weigh everything from garden vegetables to small livestock and have had no problems with it whatsoever.
2,Purchased it was only able to use a couple of times,purchased this from quick supply. was only able to use it 6-8 times everytime i was done with it i would unplug it from the outlet. purchased batteries for it to see if it was the plug and it still don't work so now im stuck with a broke scale. towards the end of it not working it didn't weigh right anymore on things including postage where i had to pay for it after it was send with the postage on the scale.
4,UltraShip Digital Postal Shipping Scale,"I have received the product and it is in fine condition. I would have liked it to have come with an adapter though so I do not always have to use/keep batteries in it, (which it did NOT). I have not used it yet since I have not started my business. SO, once I do, I will write another review again. Nice looking scale, lightweight, etc."
3,Great,Very good product. The only negative is no power cord and the cost is more than the scales. Does that make sense?
2,Does not ship with batteries or power adaptor.,"Other than that it works, after an unnecessary trip to the store to buy 4 C sized batteries. (I can't believe people still use these) It seems like if the company wanted to skimp on including an adapter they could at least send some cheap batteries in the box like everybody else does. Add 10 dollars to the price (for batteries) if you actually intend to use it."
5,"Great Scale - Excellent Price, Reliability and Feature Set. The detachable controls are NICE","I just ordered my 2nd one. My first was perfect and a really nice shade of cobalt blue. This time I'm getting black to match everything else in the kitchen. I use it for weighing coffee (I home roast), and for shipping packages. So it's great for detailed stuff - down to .1 per OZ, making it perfect for kitchen use. And also great for postal shipping, letters or packages.FYI - my last one worked just fine for many years - and somehow I lost it during my last move. It held up for YEARS of hard use without complaint. So it's only my fault alone that I'm buying a 2nd one. The newer model can handle even more load - incredible - 55#!!! I've never needed to ship more than 30 but it's nice to know that the head room is there.It's also really nice to be able to detach the faceplate. Once in a while I ship a larger box out for eBay and this is a great feature."
3,It's ok but could be better,"I'm pleased with the working of the scale but unhappy with the quality of the material. It has raw edges, places where it seems to have been snapped off. Taking shortcuts on materials in order to save money isn't good business and when I need another scale I will look at what others have to offer."
2,Parental Pressure and Material Advantage Are NOT Creating a Generation of Disconnected and Unhappy Kids,"Parental Pressure and Material Advantage Are NOT Creating a Generation of Disconnected and Unhappy Kids. The problem is disconnected and unhappy parents who do not have appropriate relationships with their kids and do not take their children with them into honest, supportive communities. The book presents some good ideas for improving conditions, but Dr. Levine has misdiagnosed the problem in the title of her book. Too many parents (people) in our culture are isolated and in their isolation they are incapable of teaching children to participate in community life and to be happy. Parents have to improve their own connectedness in adult communities before they can make real progress with their kids. Wealth is a minor distraction."
5,Great read!,I found this book both terrifying and hopeful all in one. I have already bought this as a gift for a friend as well as had another friend buy it. I'm now passing my copy on to other friends. Dr. Levine put it beautifully when she speaks of how parenting has become more of a business proposition. What happened to enjoying the journey with our kids instead of focusing on the outcome? I continue to quote this book daily and think it's a great lesson for all.
4,Your Mind is Your Kitchen,"Instructions to the cook is a easy and short read. Glassman's language translates Zen thoughts and ideas well for Westerners. This is a meditative book- not an actual recipe book. The five courses are metaphors for the zen idea of offering a ""supreme meal"" for life. The first course, for example, is spirituality, where we must cleanse the mind and prepare to make a meal. Referring the mind as your kitchen, Glassman offers meditative techniques to ""de-clutter your kitchen."""
2,Ellis doesn't believe his own advice,"Ellis manages an active fund, which completely goes against the premise of his book. If he truley believes what he wrote, he would act accordingly. However, that isn't why I gave the book 2 stars. I gave the book 2 stars because it is basically a 2-3 page paper expanded to be a full book by using fillers. There is one simple concept, and it doesn't take an entire book to get across."
5,I can reach!,"We have cathedral ceilings in our home - which are too high to reach to dust - and we live in the woods, so we have lots of cobwebs! The extension pole on this product reaches the very highest spot. The duster part bends to fit around our high ceiling fans, too, so it's really helpful. The only complaint (minor) is that the top piece does loosen a little bit while I'm using it, so I'm a little nervous it might fall off while it's 10 feet up, but I just keep tightening it as I go around the room."
5,The Best,"These Bridgedales cost a small fortune, but they last a long, long time. They also stay softer longer than other socks. I've tried SmartWool's, which wear out very quickly. The Bridgedales are comfortable, I wear mine every day, and they are great for hiking, too."
5,Nice Shiny Hardback delivered,"I received the book ""Hitler's Cross"" in very good condition. It surprised me that it was a hardback, and I do like hardbacks. It was very shiny, and the content is very beneficial for everyone to read. There's some very important concepts and realities to meditate and reflect upon concerning how the American Church is in danger of following the same deadly sinful path of the Church in Nazi Germany. We must prepare our hearts and minds now in order to resist and stand firm against any future Hitler's and antichrists (and they will come)."
4,love it,"i was given this cd totally by random, and im so glad that i was, because that is how i discover many great bands. this album has definately grown on me more and more each time i play it. some songs are better than others, but overall it is a fantastic collection of musical ideas which makes a great album. definately worth buying."
3,Only Half Way There,"If their ""Making Bones"" album showcased a unique blend of minor key melancholy with beat-fuelled revelry, then Red Snapper's latest is a rather hit-and-miss attempt at translating previous success into bigger production techniques and more expansive soundscapes. It works well when their concept of technology synchronises with more substantial rhythmic ideas (especially on the sublime ""They're Hanging Me Tonight"" and ""Shellback""), but many tracks on this album are techno-jazziness for the sake of it rather than the fusion of hedonism and contemplation for which many of us had hoped."
4,"Unfortunately, Au Courant","Dr. Feynman figured out what went wrong with the 1986 space shuttle crash...he seemed to be the only one on the investigatory commission who was an innovative and agressive investigator. It will be interesting to see if inquiries into the latest disaster with the Columbia shuttle reveal the same weaknesses in NASA communication between the head (money-raising, grandstanding) honchos and the engineers who had hands- on knowledge of the shuttle. The technological aspect is obviously pertinent but the group dynamics of the commission and the organization they were scrutinizing is the real story.In addition to the Challenger portion of the book, there are delightful chapters on the author's childhood relationship to his father and to his first wife, both of them original and irreverent characters, as, apparently, was Feynman."
1,Just plain wrong,"Most professional historians have discredited this work, especially its claim that large numbers of Southern blacks fought on the Confederate side. The author, Charles Kelly Barrow, is associated with the Sons of Confederate Veterans organization, which seeks to dis-associate the Confederate cause from the issue of slavery. The honor of my own Confederate ancestors does not require being defended by falsehoods, nor should that of anyone's ancestors. This book represents another attempt to smuggle overblown claims and bogus data into the record as if they are serious history. They are not."
4,Silk Satin Blush Pillowcase,I misunderstood and thought that I was purchasing two pillowcases for the money. It was a little too expensive for just one. The pillow case is nice and seems to be of pretty good quality.
3,It could have been better,"Unfortunately the authors intruded too much into a narrative that was rather poorly written and somewhat confusing for authors of their background. This book, in my opinion, projects an unpleasant and annoying degree of narcissism by the authors and likewise a sense of gratuitous adventuristic exploitation of a Marine unit that certainly does deserve high praise and gratitude for their heroism, sacrifice, and perseverence in the face of tremendous stress, uncertainties and severe sleep deprivation. This certainly should not be considered the definitive history of the Marine Division it is the Marines themselves that will write the definitive history and so this book can only be considered as an interim and perhaps satisfactory initial written tribute to those brave young men."
5,Mellow Prine,"If you are a John Prine fan, you will have to have this one.It's all of John's best songs recorded in a bit slower beat, with better production and instrumentation than the original recordings. Usually, I don't care for re-recorded former songs, but this is a definite exception. If you've heard the originals, you will love these. They reveal John's growthas a performer. These songs deserved this touch up.Thanks John."
3,Mixed-bag of Kurtzman,"This out of print trade-size paperback features a real mixed-bag of exerpts of Kurtzman's HELP mag. Sadly, it leans heavily on the ""Photo-toons"" that often feel like filler.Unless you find a really inexpensive copy so you can get a taste of Help, I recommend waiting for a proper reprinting of the mag in full, like the long-delayed Humbug set (are you listening Fantagraphics?)."
3,"Cute, but they snag","These are really cute, but as soon as you wash them, they don't look very good. I suggest putting them in a mesh bag before you wash them, and remember not to wash them with bibs as the velcro will snag them."
2,Very outdated,"This book does not really discuss or show how to manage the more modern hydrponic techniques, but was good basic information for the beginner"
5,Excellent portal to the Girard and his work,"If you are looking for a straightforward, clear, easy-to-understand explanation of Girard's theories and major postulates, get this book. This slim volume covers an incredible amount in its 125 pages, and michael Kirwan's prose proves easy reading. Highly recommended."
5,my personal favorite Magellan release..,"I've owned this cd for quite a while now, but i thought i'd put in my two cents. though i don't own much magellan, this is by far my favorite of their releases up to now and this includes side projects.Anyone who considers themselves a fan of progressive rock, should pick this album up. there's songs you may have to listen to a few times to like, but once they hook in, they don't let go easy. there are also some great instrumental parts on this album as well."
4,Hil St Soul,"Wonderful full, mature and soulful voice. Rich R & B, smooth jazz, and versitle yet unique style. I let some of my friends borrow the CD and they bought their own."
5,One of the best,"This is real , cool r&B. One of the best albums I have heard in a while. You will not have to skip any songs."
4,"great, but not for pot pies.","I do love these pie pans, and they work great for cooking stuff without it sticking....unless your intentions are to make pot pies. My pot pies came out great and came off of the pans super easily, but they were a little small. Now I love just using them to send my husband to work with mini pies. For the price, they have been great."
2,Cheap.,"Cheaply made. Coating was little more than paint, and that was chipped and scratched.But it's the right shape. And if I grease it up well, the non-stick function works fine."
4,Seems smaller than picture but works just fine.,"I purchased this item last month and the construction is good. However, it was a bit smaller that I had anticipated and my larger bath towels seem to overwhelm the shelf above. I think this item would be perfect for a compact bathroom however. Try using standard sized towels on the shelf instead of big ones. Overall, a good product."
5,train rack,"Looked at many train racks from the very expensive to inexpensive. This one is a great value for the price. I needed a small one for a tiny bathroom. It's sturdy, looks good, and does the job."
1,A sadly mistitled book,"For a better title, how about ""Garbage Day: My Years of Self-Delusion and Rationalization""? That does better justice to its contents. A pathetic, trashy book that epitomizes the predicament of the ""unreliable narrator."" Even Branden admits its unreliability: that's why he had to re-write it with a new, embarrassingly non-confrontational title. The hope, apparently, was to correct the more transparent errors in the first edition, and desperately to pretend that ""judgment"" was no longer at issue. But, alas, it is. It's hard to read this book with one's critical faculties ""on"" and not see that Nathaniel's critical faculties are ""off"" and have been since the 1960s. Best bet for the book: put it in the trash can, and leave it at the curb in the hopes that they'll haul it away. (Don't bother recycling it. The author has already done that.)"
4,Gift for Grandchild,"My daughter requested this toy for her daughter for Christmas. She has had lots of fun playing with it. They live out of town, thought, so I don't really have a long term review...just the initial response."
2,Nice mitt but not for adults,"I was looking for a mitt for myself to be able to play catch with my daughter. I did a search for ""baseball mitt adult"" on Amazon and this one came up. For a good brand like Mizuno I figured I couldn't go wrong for the price. It arrived very quickly but when I opened the box, it is the same size mitt as my 9-year old daughter's mitt! Way too small for an adult to use. Great youth mitt but not for adults. The 2-star rating is more for lack of accurate description than for the quality of the mitt. Now I have to return it and continue shopping."
2,Terrible,"I bought this item and would not recommend it. While the straps tighten to a good fit, the straps loosen in about 5 minutes and I have to re-tighten. It is quite a hassle. I like to take hikes with the dogs and this product is worthless for this purpose. Perhaps this product is made for a walk around the block, but not for the serious walker/hiker. Is it comfortable, though, and if they would fix the strap issue, it would probably be a fairly good carrier."
3,Cushion is nice,but it's not strong enough to hold new born baby's hed.I have 2 month old baby but I can't use this product yet.it maybe good for little older or hevy babys to carry.
4,Short but Sweet,"Forget the current hoarding reality exploitative tv (that I actually like), this is a more personal and very well done doc on the subject. There's a lot of heart in this and I ""rented"" it because I'm currently moving with half of my crap (comics, movies, toys in boxes, magazines, etc...) in storage. This made me want to weed out my stuff more than Hoarders or Storage Wars combined. It's short - 22 minutes, but for $1.99, that's half the price of a beer that lasts the same amount of time at my local pub. Good stuff."
2,Misrepresented,"Placed order for item displayed believing it was Chanel #5 Perfume. It was displayed as such but when billed after placing order for product it was described as a body creme. Nowhere in the description, written or pictorial does this give any indication that this is a body creme."
4,The Fae World,"Typical of the ""Idiot"" instructional books, this one informs and entertains. If you want to know about fairy legend and lore, this book is most helpful."
5,enjoy the Music Blend here,this is one of those recordings where you can sit back&feel the rich textures of the Rhythm Secton&Build up.Clark Terry&Bobby Brookmeyer have really good musical chemsitry.Clark Terry is one of my favorite Players.always dug His Tone.very strong Multi Set.
5,Joyous,"I bought 20+ jazz CDs this year, and I thought my collection might now be complete. However, I'm glad I didn't finish before buying this one (even though I already had part of it--""The Power of Positive Swinging""). It's wonderous, joyous, swinging jazz."
5,this is a very good book,i think this is a very good bbook because i lvoe caitinlin sooooo much! and shes kewl adn uder stuff so buy this book
4,Beware of nanoparticles,It moisturizes great but it contains nanoparticles which crosses the blood-brain barrier and may have an adverse affect on your brain as this stuff accumulates in your brain cells.
4,"A funny, fun read although with some accuracy problems!","Why is an academic book funny? This book is written by a angry feminist and some of her comments about the sexual bias in academic criticism are very funny (to other feminists that is)! When this book first came out, it was really important because there was almost no easily accessable information on early women writers. We now have tons of better and more accurate books on earlier women writers, but this one is still fascinating for its down-to-earth, ""I'm not going to take this anymore"" tone. Also the pictures add interest!"
3,Wrong picture! Handles are not the same!,"Amazon placed the faucet Delta 2476-24,not Delta 2476! I had to buy thisfancy handles with accent separetly for $40.Handles that came with this faucet made of plastic! They are cheap!Bewareof this!But the faucet are very nice,and with this handles look fancy!"
4,Feminist story of Mary Magdalene,"The book is about Mary Magdalene. It begins when Mary (called Miriam in the book) is ten years old and ends when she is about to meet Jesus (Joshua). The book portrays Miriam as a young woman who struggles against the hypocrisies of her society and especially against the restrictions against women (women aren't supposed to leave the home, for example or sing in synagogue). I enjoyed the book but wondered about its historical accuracy-especially about Miriam's struggle against the expectations for women. Some of her thoughts and actions seemed too modern. I think that teenage girls will be able to identify with some of Miriam's struggles. Miriam gets into trouble just for being the person she is-she doesn't purposefully always go searching for trouble."
1,Wasted my time and money,This Movie sucked so bad. The actors sucked. The plot sucked. Don't waste your money on this movie.
4,Great for Kindle,Like it on my Kindle but when the people talk their words do not match the movement on their mouths. would like more HGTV shows.
3,Tunnel Vision,"Tunnel Vision is a fun read. Far from the greatest book ever written, yet fun nonetheless. Give it a whirl if you are interested, but don't expect the world to change. I hope someone makes the movie soon."
3,Book Synopsis,"Publication Date: 07/01/1983Book Description:HER BEAUTY WAS MORE THAN SKIN DEEP ...Libby Dreiser was a chemist who parlayed her knowledge into the ownership of a big- money cosmetics corporation. Jay Gatling was the man she went to when she needed financing for her newest idea.Together they could take the business world by storm, but there was another world that was far more important to them - one with room for only two, where things were done Libby's way."
1,It's no good,"I saw all the great comments and bought one. The picture is not nearly as clear as the one I have. Besides, I try to clip it to my flat monitor and it won't stay. The stand looks very fragile and won't work for me at all. I won't recommend this product."
2,"Poor image quality, poor design","I know, this is a cheaper camera. We're all trying to save these days. Still... this one is really bad.The design: cheapy. Sorry, I couldn't come up with another word for it.When my daughter went up to adjust it on the laptop, the base broke like it was made of sugar.The video quality is really poor - both pixelized and choppy. So you basically can't use it other than as a talking head, and even then, IF you're not moving your head, your mouth, or breathing, then you *may* get a recognizable image...For this price range, it's not the worse, but frankly, it's not doing very much for you. For $39.99, you can get an IPEVO POV webcam, that'll have much higher resolution, better frames per seconds (30fps, standard on all chat services), solid design so you aren't afraid it'll fall apart within 1 week, and you can hand it off to your kids to show grandma the dog without fearing for your $30...Overall, very disappointing, even for that price."
1,"not the european edition, but the mexican one","Although the picture shown is from the european DVD the one that ships is the Mexican edition, which transfer to dvd is below standard. sadly the movie (arguably the best in spanish cinema history) suffers big time. I will never buy from viveros2007 again. Once again if you are planning on buying this item... I strongly recommend to download it from any torrent (even if this breaks copyright laws), because picture quality is gonna be 1000 times better!!Sorry viveros2007... had to be said. Next time show the right picture in the product description. Highly dissapointed..."
2,"Beware, no english subtitles","Rating is for the DVD, and NOT the film. I figured this would have English subtitles, being region 1.... It doesn't. DVD is useless to me, since I don't speak Spanish. I've heard great things about this film, and I love the director's other works. Watch out for ""The Last Circus""... That film rocks."
5,Great horror movie,This is really an enjoyable horror movie with character. It is a mix of horror and black comedy. The characters are great and strange.
3,Did the job,"I needed to feed two (2) TV sets from a camcorder which was taping a discourse. The TVs were located downstairs in 2 separate rooms while the camcorder was running upstairs in the main auditorium. The distance was definitely less than 100 ft. Initially, when we set this up to test, the picture on the TV screens was clear with no static. However, when the attendees for the discourse began to fill the building, the TVs started to flicker and static. Once everyone settled, the picture seemed to stabalize and the guests could see most of the discourse clearly on the TV.To summarize my experience...the transimitter/receiver did the job and setup was incredibly easy. However, it was an inconvenience for me to have to purchase 2 sets of the transmitter/receiver just to get an additional receiver. Lorex doesn't sell this separately. Don't ask me why? Other vendors that I researched do."
3,Wireless video,It works as claimed but not through more than one wall if metallic studs are involved.
2,Interesting. If you've never heard about the internet.,The useful contenet could be limited to bout 20 concise pages. Lots of outdated info (Isuzu Trooper?? Mitsubishi Montero?? Geo Tracker??). Do you really need to know how to tell a large SUV from a small SUV? Really? Lots of links and references that you could get in about 5 seconds with any web search. Needs a thorough update.
5,Science K-8: An Integrated Approach,Great resource for beginning teachers. Each chapter gives detailed information on teaching Science. Background information is also helpful. I really love the sample lessons and activities. A book I will keep in my bag of tricks...
1,"If you are running Leopard, look out!",I bought this game to run on my Mac and discovered that it would not operate in conjunction with Leopard. I brought it back to the Apple Store and they had trouble with it also.
5,Precious Memories,"Thanks for the prompt delivery and the nice condition of this book. My brother and I read this book as children and I was excited to share my copy of it with my children. Unfortunately, my copy was misplaced. However, I was immensely pleased to learn that all was not lost because you had the very same book available for purchase! It feels so nice to share a piece of my childhood with my children. Thank you."
5,Well worth the time and the price! Must Read!,An excellent book on a difficult subject. Very well researched.
3,does the job,They are ok but you can probably get them for same price or better at lots of stores. good enough for me.
3,Some problems with order,"Like some other people I thought they came in pairs but there is only 1 wristband. Initially I ordered two regular size wristbands (3.15' x 3') and two of the slightly longer version (all different colors). A few days later, I placed the exact same order so that I could get a matching pair for all my wristbands. This time, all the wristbands that I received were the regular 3.15 x 3 version even though I made the exact same order. Looks like I'll have to order for a third time to finally match them all."
5,"A ""Must Own"" for Lovecraft Fans","As anyone who knows and loves the work of the brilliant author, HP Lovecraft, his stories are not silly, spoon-fed horror- they are packed with mysticism, the occult and ""eldrich darkness"". His prose is sometimes dense and difficult to fathom, but the effort is well worth it and you will find the true joy of HPL is going back and reading his tales time and again, each time finding new meaning, new insight on the horrors of existence. ""Dagon"" is for the most part a very misunderstood, and under-appreciated member of HPL's library, but once you have read it you will agree it is one of his greater triumphs. No fan of Lovecraft, horror, or inspired english literature should be without it."
1,Lockey Digital M210 Mechanical Keyless Entry Bump Proof Deadbolt Door Lock White Finish,"Lockey Digital M210 Mechanical Keyless Entry Bump Proof Deadbolt Door Lock White FinishThe lock is very small. There is no handle, buttons are too close and do not light up in dark. It does not close properly. It broke after 2 weeks of use.I do not recommend it at all."
3,Good charger,"This charger works well. It is not anything special, but it does the job. The nice part of it, is that it works with so many different Nokia phones. There are a few different Nokia phones in our family, and it works with all of them."
1,A waste of money,"A libertarian screed on the Civil War with very few sources and very slanted to the southern view of History.Would not recommend to anyone, not even my worst enemy!!"
3,somewhat disappointed,"this was my first vibrator, and i did alot of searching before choosing it. the reason i went for this one was because many of the other vibrators i looked at just weren't thick enough. this one seemed like it would satisfy me in that area. unfortunately, it didn't. it's not thin, but it still isn't thick enough for my tastes. also, the clit stimulator is much too close to the body of the vibrator and gets in the way instead of being useful. there are some good things about it though. it's much quieter than i would have expected, and the vibrations are very powerful. it's not a bad product, but i don't think it's spectacular by any means."
5,Report from Ground Zero,An outstanding book written by Dennis Smith.It brings you back to the day and gives you chills.This is a must have book. It honors those that lost their lives and brings you closer to them. God Bless America
1,dont buy,i bought like 5 of these towels and they all stop working after i wash them 2 or 3 times.they get all rubbery and wont pick up water.your way better off with a normal towel.what a waste of my money.dont buy.i don't know what everybody is thinking when they give a thumbs up to this product on this website.proves u cant believe everything on amazon.
3,Hoped for a bit better absorption,"Several reviewers found this towel to be very absorbent. I am sure much of the response depended on variables such as texture, length of hair etc. My hair is medium/short, fine but not thin. I also live in a semi-arid climate and like to let me hair air dry as much as possible after towel drying. I sadly did not find this product worked for me much better than my terry cloth towels."
5,Awesome I love it,It cuts drying time in half and my hair seems to be looking better. I highly recommend you buy one.
2,Meh.,"This towel is just okay, definitely not worth what they're charging. Not something I'd buy again. It gets the water out, but not as well as the cheesecloth towel I bought it to replace. It's an awkward size for following my normal hair routine (plopping, for any CGs considering a purchase)- long enough but just not wide enough, though I thought from the dimensions that it would be. My hair is long (between shoulders and mid-back), so this might not be as much of an issue for people with shorter cuts."
3,"Fun Designs, but a bit expensive","As the title suggests this book has four chapters,one for each season. For each season there's a sampler and simple but practical, functional projects and a number of colorful,playful almost childlike designs: scarecrows, ducks, flowers,fruit and angels to name a few. The winter season includes an interesting Santa stocking and some tree ornaments. This book is suitable for different skill levels,but mostly from simple to medium, the charts are color coded, , but I think the price is a bit too steep for the patterns offered. The ""501 cross stitch designs"" book is more packed."
5,Each life touches so many. This book will touch you as well.,"We all have our faith tested along the way. In ""Gentle Mercies"", Haralson gives us many reasons for our faith to be strengthened. These wonderful stories from a former minster turned country lawyer show how ordinary lives can touch others in extraordinary ways. Topics ranging from coping with the depths of mental illness to living with a family pickup truck named 'Old Red' will make you laugh, cry, and take inventory of your own walk of faith."
3,Way too small..,"I just bought this scooter for my son's 7th birthday. Last year I purchased the razor scooter that looks like a mini vespa for my daughter which is the hit of her school. I paid similar prices for both. I was astonished how small the motorcycle is, to the point where I am considering returning it. No where did I see how small it is in comparison to the other razor scooters. It does say miniature but assumed that meant compared to a real motrocycle."
2,we will see!,"well, its what i expected. and its compact and tiny but holds my wt 150 just like it says. but it was shipped to my doorstep in a box just like u would buy it the store, only mines was ripped opened. looked like someone just ripped it open at the store were it was delivered from and they just shipped it to my doorstep when i asked them not to leave on my doorstep. we will see how my 7 yrs old likes and ill update u!"
1,CUTE BIKE - THAT'S IT,This was purchase as a X-MAS gift and was a blast for our 5 year old. PLEASE TRUST THIS REVIEW. THE CHARGER/BATTERY ONLY WORKS FOR 30 MINUTES AT A GOOD SPEED. If you are going up hill at all(over and over) after 5 minutes of riding the power has gone. The age rating is confusing. Way to small for a 10 year old. Framing falls off after a few falls to the ground. If you really want to get a motorcycle save up and get a gas powered Honda then put a governor on it. We did try to ride this on the grass but it has no speed or traction. This is a great item but the durability is terrible and the battery & charger are worse.
4,Kids review,I love This Pocket Rocket Its fun and it goes faster than a eletric razor scooter.I Realy Enjoy This thing even mY Friend likes it.Im wondering if i can put a gas engine in there.Anyways I got this for chrismas 2010 and i realy enjoy it.
2,"Can't Charge Batteries, So Can't Use","We are unable to charge the batteries. As soon as I plug it in the light turns green and the charging stops, but the batteries are still dead. I don't know if it is the charger or the batteries or the cabilng, but something is bad worng. Of course, the 8-year old who got it for Christmas is devistated. We'll see how the service department shapes up when they reopen after the holiday."
4,See it for the romance,"The Adjustment Bureau is first and foremost a love story. It just happens to be set in the Twilight Zone. The onscreen chemistry between Matt Damon and Emily Blunt is electric and carries the movie through scenes, that when you stop to think about them, are fairly preposterous. Fortunately, it's easy to lose yourself in this beautifully photographed story of two people who struggle and race against fate to stay together and not worry too much about the metaphysics of the whole thing. The movie wears the cloak of its spiritual message lightly, and those who complain about its revisionist take on Judeo-Christian mythology miss the point. Just root for the lovers and enjoy the ride."
3,So so,"Nothing special here. A good movie but not worth buying. You can rent it and it is watchable, but forgettable. If you have another choice, then make it."
1,I was tricked!,The scifi idea was a good one but this is basically a stupid love story at its core. The scifi wrapping was just a disguise to trick geeks into watching it! It is so hard to find good scifi anymore...sigh.
1,I wouldn't call it sci-fi,"The Adjustment Bureau works behind the scenes arranging people's fate. But David Norriss wants to control his own fate. He manages to catch the Bureau in the act of ""adjusting"" his fate and is threatened to never speak of it and to stay away from a woman he has just met. The Bureau attempts to enforce this separation but Norriss avoids them and foils their varied efforts.I was expecting a sci-fi thriller, but instead found romantic and religious mush. Was it a stab at the Greek gods, God, a debate personified, or the visual musings of the existence of any supreme being. It really wasn't worth my time or money."
4,Provocative story of fate and free will,"Matt Damon and Emily Blunt play a couple who are not supposed to be together, according to the mysterious and interfering group of angels (?) known as the Adjustment Bureau. They exist to adjust people's actions and have them play out a master plan of some kind. But the main character David fights against this, as he wants to live his own life and do what he chooses instead of having his destiny controlled.Interesting food for thought."
4,Great underrated movie,"This is a terrific movie, an interesting mix of sci-fi/alternate reality and romance. Great acting and an original premise make this fun to watch. The mix of drama, suspense, and action will engross you, but at its heart, this is a moving and powerful romance."
1,Difficult,"This arrived in 4 pieces that must be aligned and mounted and is Very Difficult to do. And the line where they join detracts from the over all look. No where in the description did it say it would be in 4 pieces. When I read it was 12' X 4"" I thought it was one continuous roll and wish it was That would have been so much easier to mount. Not 4 pieces 4' X 3' each."
2,Looks good - for a minute,"My boys (5 and 1) received this as a gift from their grandparents. Within a week, the top of the table was chipping. Structurally it is in great shape. It looked so beautiful and I loved the sophisticated color. I'm very disappointed in the way that it is wearing. They boys don't abuse it, but they definitely use it. They color, have snacks, play games and do puzzles on the table. However, I would say it only gets used less than once per day. (It's not in the room we spend the most time in.)"
3,Surprise Surprise!,"I was very excited to find this table set for my grandchildren. I read all the reviews and thought I would take a chance even though some reviews were less than sterling! I ordered it in natural as opposed to the other color, brown. You can imagine my surprise when I saw the video of my grandchildren sitting at a WHITE painted table and chair set!!!!So if the finish--color--is important to you, you may not want to take the chance and order this item. Since this item was recently purchased, the durability is yet to be seen!"
5,Love this set.,"I have two grandkids (5 and 2) but was having family over that would bump the kid number up to 6. Even though I bought it for ""company"" my grandkids love sitting at their table. The only down side is the soft wood scratches up easily. But overall I like the table and chairs. Easy to assemble."
5,Not Pottery Barn Kids...But a close second!,"I've been lusting after the PBK kids table, but it's SO expensive! A friend of mine suggested this one, and the price couldn't be beat! I put it together myself, but I did need a second pair of hands for most of the chairs because there were some issues. But once we got it together, it's been great! Sturdy and very cute. I'm so glad I bought it!"
1,Expect terrible service and a poor experiance!,Horrible customer service!! Take forever to get your item if at all. Agents there pass your aruond and never give you a correct answer as well lie to get rid of you.
2,"Easy to assemble, looks nice out of box but dings up too easy","really liked the look of this product, and it's durability out of the box, but after placing puzzles on it, the finish dinged, and now shows white spots. would not purchase again - need something that will keep it's finish a bit better."
5,Excellent product,"I am really impressed with the quality of this product. It is made of sturdy solid wood and excellent looking. Unlike so many assembly required items, it was easy to put together. The instructions were no problem to follow. The bolts, nuts, screws, and tools came in an oganized vaccum sealed package so there was no mistake about which bolt to use where. I reccommend following the tip on the package to dip bolt ends in dish liquid before attaching. This tip made assembly go smoothly. My grandkids will enjoy using it for years to come!"
2,Disappointed....finish came off within first 30 days,I purchased this set at the end of August and within 30 days the finish was coming off the tables and chairs. It is now only 4 months old and looks like I have had it for years. The reason I ordered this set was a friend recommended KidKraft and said her set had held up great. I am very disappointed with this product.
3,Fun but short,"My 10-year-old daughter absolutely loved this game, but she finished it in a day and a half."
3,Interesting,"Although the Blair Witch, herself did not appear in the film, I think McFarlane has done some good work on translating the unseen villain into an action figure!the obvious signs of being old, withered and dead, can be seen all over this atrocity: the rotted, wrinkled flesh, the disembowelled mid-section and the hideously hidden face, lunge at you with wonderful detail and spectacular ugliness!all in all a good figure, but some let-downs are aparrent, mild posability (arms only; legs can be moved, but there is no use)being unable the hold the scythe weapon properly and the over-use of veils, due to the veils, the figure loses some eye-candy value, which, I think, is important."
1,Keep on looking,There are no interviews with band members or no actual replacements music... just a bunch of tools telling you how cool they are because they saw them first.... bored to death after the first 5 minutes.
4,Because a great band deserves its due.,"The Replacements were the type of band that postured behind the old cliche of every ambitious rock band that they were going to do it their way and not follow any rules. But unlike many of those bands, they meant it, and they created a loyal following that this movie presents to us in celebration of the Mats. Even though I think the inclusion of music would have helped to enlighten the unfamiliar watching this doc, it still works beautifully in letting the rest of us share in what it was like to have experienced them, and ""them"" is a band that made some mighty damn good rock and roll that ""shoulda woulda coulda"" been big hits in a smarter world. They didn't get their proper due then. Hopefully, this cool documentary gets it for them now."
3,JB'S GREAT; NOT QUITE AS GREAT ON THE SOURCE,"I LOVE JB; I DESPERATELY WANT A LIVE CD! THIS ONE DISAPPOINTED; SEEMS ALMOST LIKE HE HAD TO TURN THIS OUT, GIVEN ITS CLOSENESS IN RELEASE AFTER STORY OF LIFE (A BETTER ALBUM). THOUGH HIS LYRICS (ESPECIALLY THE SPIRITUAL AND SOUTH AFRICAN REFERENCES) ARE ALWAYS GERMANE, HIS SOUND ON SOME OF THE SOURCE SIDES ARE TOO HIP-HOP, TO DUPLICATIVE OF SO MUCH THAT'S ALREADY OUT THERE.LOVE HIM NONETHELESS. ALSO LOVE THE FACT THAT THERE ARE ACTUALLY TEENS WHO DIG HIM AND HIS SOUND. THERE'S HOPE FOR THE WORLD YET!"
5,Terrific,"Written by an intelligent sensitive Asian woman who displays understanding and wisdom. Full of practical advice, lots of quotes from Asian ladies, and good reading. The author is especially good on understanding and explaining the differences between varied Asian cultures and countries -- China, Korea, Japan, Thailand and the Philippines. Highly recommended."
2,Only seems to work about 28% of the time,"A little disappointed...I had much better luck with the book ""How to Attract White Women."" However, Ming Tan's book did get me more dates than ""How to Attract Insane and Hateful Women Who Very Much Resemble Ann Coulter."""
1,Wow,"I haven't read this book but holy crap. The synopsis had me rolling on the floor. I sent this to a vietnamese friend of mine and I can't wait to hear her reaction. I'm going to get this for her for her birthday. As an object of ridicule this book gets a five. But treated seriously its just plain sad. As a minority (I'm arab) and a man this book is just sick. To any white people reading this. Only buy this book as a joke. Being attracted to a woman of a different race solely because they are a different ""exotic"" race dehumanizes them and while not necessarily racist it is almost certainly misogynistic. Ming Tan is pretty much a dirty sell-out race traitor."
1,"If You Need This Book, You're Pathetic","I'm an American woman of Middle Eastern descent and I find that most American men suffering from ""yellow fever"" are insecure, timid and unable to relate to women who challenge them.This is why they mostly seek out introverted, physically unimposing Asian women.I would never date a man who was attracted to Asian women."
2,Not Very Ground Breaking,"Ming Tan has written a book that offers very little insight on the subject matter. Most of the content seemed to be common sense almost anyone who has dated women of any race would already know. Furthermore, what little new information she does provide is repeated over and over. That, combined with innumerable quotations from random surveys, makes this book into a lengthy and boring read.I couldn't stop shaking my head while reading, knowing what a waste of time and money it was."
1,As a fellow Asian woman...,"...I think it's fair for me to say that your book is a piece of garbage. Anyhow, congratulations! You've slightly delayed social progress while capitalizing on Yellow Fever!"
1,"Retitle this book ""How to be a Rapist""","Look, Asian women are no different than the rest. There is nothing special you have to do but be yourself and grow up."
5,The Mind Reader,"How could this man have read every thought of mine over 100 years before my birth?! Timeless truth in all of his writings...not just this one. This is a most intimate example being his personal journal. Every word, every well thought out phrase speaks to my heart and idea of what truth should look and sound like. It should make you catch your breath and Thoreau absolutely accomplishes this for me."
3,Are you kidding?,"I have a hard time understanding how so many readers could think this book is worth five stars. The basic plot--love across different cultures--is a favorite of mine. But the only tension in the story comes from cardboard characters misunderstanding each other. I just didn't find the characters believable or acting like real people. The best examples of this kind of romance remain Lois Bujold's Shards of Honor, or Pamela Belle's The Silver City."
5,Great new author,"I could not put this book down. I was afraid at first it was going to be full of clichés, but it wasn't. Set some time before the Greek/Roman time, it balanced a great deal of action and different cultures clashes with a love story. I immediately came on line to determine when the next one was coming out and was extremely disappointed that it was not until 2006. Biggest draw back - a few things in the wrong time - Like ""the light shining off of his chain mail"" long before chain mail was invented. Plus there was some medieval morality. Don't let it distract you though, it is a great book."
2,It's okay?,Just not too impressed. I wish there was a rating system like with movies and games that would give you an idea of what to expect. I know now that this book is NOT an appropriate book for my teenage daughters. Thankfully i do read what they are interested in reading before they do.
3,SAVING IT,I BOUGHT THIS BOOK FOR MY 6TH GRADE ESL CLASS. THE BOOK IS GREAT BUT TOO ADVANCED FOR THEM SO I WILL SAVE IT TIL LATER ON.
4,Pimping Paradise,"We do what we are told. We buy what we are sold.Orwell introduced us to Big Brother. Well, Shakur creates a world of which I call ""Big Family"", whereby Ursula and Ivy discover the ""paradessence"" of life, which as described by Shakur, is that want and need are the same thing.The Strange Girl tells us that our raison detre is to assimilate and emulate."
3,Simply complicated,"Savage Girl entices with its begining and middle but loses its momentum in the end. Mr. Shakar creates engaging characters. His gift for creating gorgeous ideas that translate well into words is astouding. Still, there is alot of wading through extraneous information. Maybe he is trying to hard to impress which struck me as being in direct opposition to the novel's central core."
3,Not his best presentation.,"It looked like a recording session laying down rough cuts to be sweetened later. For example, no harmony vocals, no audience, the band while quite skilled looked bored. I did know Albert was no front man, but that's all the more reason to have the extras.Best part for me was the bonus material which provided Albert's progression over the years. I'm sorry to say I would not recommend especially at the price.Carl Sharpe"
5,"This is a very good book, not only for commercial professionals but for users of commercial services.","This is a very good book, not only for commercial professionals but for users of commercial services. In particular it clearly explains the difference between a consultant and a contractor, which is what dominates the security industry at present.Prescribed reading to all commercial innovators (not just from a top line revenue growth perspective), even those that have been at it for some time. I guarantee everyone has something to learn from Alan's insights, even if it is to qualify in simple terms issues that you have been irritating you for some time and you couldn't quite put your finger on the solution. You will find it here"
5,Guru in consulting,"I bought this book because of the title. And this book gives advice that will make your pracitce prosper not far from the title of the book, if you apply the concept diligently. I use it as my reference in my work quite often. I saw Alan in person from a seminar in Boston after reading his book. I flew from Bangkok just to meet the man. Great advice on consulting. If you want to build your practice. This is a must in your collection"
5,Best Starter Available!,"Weiss does it again with a great overall manual, almost step-by-step instruction, for starting and growing a successful consulting practice. A must-have for the new consultant in an expanding field!"
3,Preety good...but,"The name list is limited,I have 2 kids, Wyatt and Ryan, and None of their names or middle names wre valid...go figure huh? Wyatt loves Diego and to talk on the phone, so he still has fun with it. But Diego doesn't know HIS name."
2,"A warped product of its times, saved only by its uniqueness","It's well and fine if you first read this book as an adult but imagine if you were, as I was, a young child who first stumbled upon this book in his parents' (who were at the time psuedo-""hippies"") collection. Yuck. Filled to the brim with early-70's psychobabble, illustrated with diagrams and clip art that are as tedious as they are quixotic, this book is a cultural relic of no lasting importance. It is saved from an even lower score because ""Ram Dass"" was at least clever enough to try to create his own overarching philosophy, as drug-blurred and nonesencial as that philosophy was."
5,Still current,"Remember, Be Here Now is a wonderful book, still current today--to be read slowly. We used it in a study group as well."
2,Awful presentation,"Sorry all, but I found the layout of the content to be incredible displeasing. I don't have the patience to flip a bunch of pages up and read a bunch of scattered oversized words, not even in cohesive sentences, amidst weird drawings. Maybe if I were on acid, but seriously, as a means to find relaxation among a stressful day, trying to read that and make sense of things will honestly just make my head hurt even more. It's creative and funky, I'll give that, but it really should be re-published in a more conventional layout. The 'tripped out' drawings can be put in the margins and the main words put where they should be. I dunno. I don't exactly have time to make sense of things, sadly. If it's not accessible easily, then no matter how 'creative' or 'trippy' it is, it's essentially useless to most people who come across it, except the most dedicated, patient, and time-flexible."
3,Surprising,"I sincerely did not like Darden before I read this book. I too considered him to be an Uncle Tom and a traitor to his race. However, I changed my mind after reading the book. I now see Darden as a man who stood up for what HE believed was right. Still there is a bit of bias on his part towards OJ. I have to wonder if his desire to convict OJ came out of belief in OJ's guilt or if Darden wanted to convict OJ for being a somewhat poorly educated man who Darden feels was unjustly rewarded with riches. I feel as though Darden's ideas about the race factor in the trial were a bit warped considering the fact that if Furhman lied aobut his racial epithets, he would surely lie about planting evidence."
2,"Better title: ""In DENIAL""","Darden inflates his own legal skills as well as the other prosecutors'. Darden actually believes his race had nothing to do with his being put on the prosecution team, and that the prosecutors put on a good case. He does offer one insight about an early hearing where Darden let his emotions get hot in one early hearing: ""When the hearing was over, I gathered my things and walked toward the clerk, still in a bit of a funk.""I heard a voice, but I couldn't tell at first who was talking to me. I looked down at the table and realized O.J. Simpson was talking under his breath to me. `Man,' he said flatly, `you need to learn to control your temper.'"""
4,Good Advice,"For some of us, Ray Dodd's book is a good reminder of what we know but often fail to apply. To others it may open a world of new ideas never thought of before. It is a book I intend to keep at hand to remind myself when I slip back into old ways of thought and habits, that I really can live my dream."
1,not in English,"Unless you can speak in Chinese, don't get this, it's very little instruction in English and then you have to wait for her to repeat the very little instruction in Chinese..... the music is awful as well. I would not recommend this."
5,Dive into an exhilarating fantasy,"With Isabel, imagine swooping through the ocean with large, friendly whales! Imagine having them understand you (as even your best human friends don't, quite). As she practices living as a whale, Isabel also learns some important human skills as well. This wonderfully playful book rings true in its treatment of a young girl's relationships with friends and teachers and family members, her awakening interest in boys (even if they are boy-whales), and her growth in compassion and awareness."
4,A fun toy with a nice price,My 9 month old son got this for Christmas and has a lot of fun with it. It's got lots of things to do and noises to go with them. He especially likes the beads in it that make noise when you shake it. I think it's a good value for the money and was very happy with my purchase.
3,Monroe shocks,"I ordered 2 Monroe Sensa-Trac 37040 shocks and received 2 Monroe Reflex 911040 shocks. The Reflex shocks fit my automobile, and (911040) is handwritten on the invoice with no further explanation. The Sensa-Trac has superseded the Reflex."
2,I'm confused,"I read this book but was it just me or was this tome a complete rip-off of Richard Matheson's ""I Am Legend""?"
1,Overpriced and poorly built,I got this Laserpod last year as a Christmas gift. It gave out after less then a year of use but since it was purchased in November the company won't honour the warrenty. The person who purchased it for me said they paid nearly $200.00 for it so I think it's a fair price around $50.00 considering how it's made. It's basiclly just 3 LED lights and 1 laser like you get in a $4.00 laser pointer that shine on a rotating crystal. It is now a $200.00 paper weight. The images give a false impression of what the lamp is really like. The lights are much dimmer and only work in a completely dark room. The differnet shades do little to improve the effects or visibility. I had been using it as a night light in my hallway as it makes for an interesting effect on the ceiling when it's dark and while it lasted. Would never buy another product from this company.
1,The Worst Movie Ever Made,"My wife bought this and we watched it together based on reviews we had seen. All I can say is that this movie represents 2 hours of my life that I'll never get back. There was absolutely no character development...in fact, I only caught the names of 3 or 4 characters in the whole movie. The music was strange and the ballet numbers looked more like interpretive dance at the local community college. I'm seriously considering writing to Sony to ask for a refund. Do yourself a favor, if you want to see a ballet movie, get Center Stage. At least you get characters to care about and better dancing."
4,Loved this movie,"I originally borrowed this movie from the public library and loved it so much I purchased a copy. I especially enjoyed the amazing dance scenes. Most movies about dancers are set around the relationships away from the stage and studio. I liked this movie because it was full of amazing performances by incredibly talented dancers. I've never been a big fan of modern dance, but I enjoyed the combination of modern dance combined with the more classical elements of ballet."
3,Just okay.,"This movie is about a ballet dancer, played by Neve Campbell, who wants to be noticed for her talent by her school. The acting was pretty good and the sets were artistic and original, but this is the movie that just was. It doesn't really go anywhere or have much of a point, but there are some lovely moments."
1,This is one dancer who hated this film!,"I'm a classical ballet dancer, and I loved Center Stage, Fame, etc. so I naturally thought this movie would be interesting. I was wrong. Granted, the dancers were good, but I was expecting more classical ballet pieces and um, a plot? This film had NO PLOT, seriously, and no real meaning so far as I understood it. It didn't really give a good look into the dancer's world in my opinion. You're much better off watching Center Stage. I turned it off halfway through because I was bored out of my gourd, and I usually love dance films. All in all, this move bit the big one."
2,"Ballet, A+ -- Story, F-","The ballet scenes were exquisite, but the absence of any story whatsoever (and I reject the notion that the story here was the development of the creative process), made this a very confusing and ultimately dull film. Characters came and went and possessed no depth whatsoever - not even the main character (and writer/producer), played by Neve Campbell.If I were rating this purely on the ballet scenes, it would have to be a five. But this is a movie, not a ballet, and it needed a story. I'm at a loss to discuss the film any further, and am surprised that others found more words to use than I have."
1,Impossible To Contact,I ordered this in August. What I received was not what I ordered. They sent me a louvered insert instead of a bracket. I have sent emails and left voicemail and nobody returns either. I would give them a minus five if that were possible. At this point my next step is to put it in dispute with my credit card company. Don't order anything from these people!
1,title of review,"This album is really boring. I'm all for sparseness, if it's used to accentuate musical elements. That's something Low does well. But there are no musical elements here to accentuate. Nothing is happening. It goes nowhere. I suppose there is some creative vision at work here, and this is what they wanted to create, but I just don't see what there is to possibly like about it."
3,"Nice figure, but Arnold 's likeness is missing.","According to reports I heard, since Arnold is involved with trying to get a T3 film underway, he had McFarlane toys scrap the two head designs they had in favor of one that shows no likness at all. Previous head designs I had seen had a great Fully unblemished Arnold likeness, and then one that showed his face near the end of the 2nd film. Basically, his latest face is quite horrendous, which makes me thankful for the trademark shades he wears in the film.The rest of the figure is well-done, except the ammo belt he wears seems to be modeled to it the wrong way.Mainly I bought this T-800 because it seemed wrong to just get the T-1000. Other than that, it seemed to be kind of a disappointment."
1,Pricey piece of [garbage],this device is severely limited in compatibility with CD-R media. have had a very difficult finding CD-R music cds that the device will burn. TDK worked for about 10 cds but now the drive wouldn't recognize TDK CD-R Music as Music discs. I'm pretty fed up with this piece of [garbage]and it's only 30 days old.
3,"pretty good , but doesnt portray the true image of the rx7","this book could have been better although i must give credit to the author for the research, and time that he put into the book. well done"
1,Beware! This is NOT Sugarbomb!,This CD is not by the Les Farrington led Sugarbomb. It is an act named 'Sugabomb'. Hopefully Amazon will correct the mistake.
1,Like a B movie,"For all the hype, this is a really boring read. The writing is wooden and the story is tired. Nothing new at all, save your money"
3,"Informative, but not very helpful on its own","I am battling infertility and have spent a lot of time researching natural methods to help me achieve pregnancy, as well as seeing a doctor, and I had high hopes for this book. Though there is a lot of information in it, I felt like it is aimed primarily at convincing a person they should find and be treated by a TCM practitioner. It is much too complicated to try and use the information to diagnose and treat yourself.If you are thinking about being treated with Traditional Chinese Medicine, or are already seeing a TCM practitioner and want to understand more about what you are doing, this book is for you. If you were hoping to go the natural route self-guided... if you can't look at your tongue and instantly decipher if it is too wet, dry, fat, thin, light or dark... take a pass on this one."
4,Idea in progress,"I like the ideas presented in the book. They make sense - heal the body and you will become more fertile. I can't yet claim to see results from the book as I am still not pregnant, but it has only been a month."
3,It was good,I enjoyed the book but thought it could have elaborated more. The title was cleaver. Overall good job.
4,Evolution,The turok series has certainly evolved since my last experience with turok on N64 lol. For evolution It's still fun to run through the similar jungle and rainforest covered levels with a decent selection of weapons killing what now appear to be some sort of humanoid reptilians lol. The flying levels are probably my favorite part.
2,Don't bother.,"I love Turok; been playing them all since the first. But, they've all been going downhill since then and Evolution is the pinnacle of bad FPS.The story is boring. After a few chapters, I really didn't care what happened to Turok. The controls are incredibly slow and confusing. That combined with the LONNNGGGG load-times makes for an unpleasant wait. The engine is exactly the same as the prior Turoks except with more polygons. What does that mean? It means a horrifically slow frame-rate. The sound quality is vastly under par and hard on the ears."
1,Don't bother.,"I've played enough first person shooters to know that this one wasn't worth the time or money I spent on it. Graphics are so-so. Level designs aren't much better. The game play seems to drag and skip whenever the action heats up. At first, I thought the flight sim sequences were a novel idea, but the moment things started to get exciting, the game paused to load the next section which totally broke the game rhythm. Switching weapons also happens to be sluggish, making combat sequences far more difficult than they should be. Considering the quality of most games Acclaim puts out, this one was a major disappointment. If you're in the mood for an entertaining FPS, I would strongly suggest something like Deus Ex: The Conspiracy. The Medal of Honor and Red Faction series are also strong. I wish I could put a finger on what really irritated me about this game, but I can't--some games are a challenge while others are a chore to get through. Simply put, it's not fun."
1,Ugh. Horrible horrible horrible...,"I really wanted this game to be good. I hoped the few bad reviews here on Amazon were a fluke, but alas... I rented it and was done within an hour or two. Uninspired graphics, boring gameplay, confusing controls and overall very unsatisfying. I think of myself as a fair person but this game flat out sticks. It took gaming back about a million years (to the dinosaur age)."

4,Work fine,What can I expect from a phone batteries? This one works fine and so far it is holding up just fine. So far so good. :)
4,Player turned Step Dad,"I am really tired of the Player Pimp Culture of the Black Community. Then they wonder why no one respects them and they are the lowest on the social scale. However, this movie has some redeeming qualities. Yet, I do rate it 4 stars. The acting was not that bad. Black Women if our attitude is like this sisters (main character) then we do have some work to do. While the attitude is justified, it still does not look good."
4,"Mayfair Natural Reflections Round Toilet Seat, Cherry with Brass Hinges #9602BR178","The seat arrived in good condition, packed well. The fit was perfect and took about 10 minutes to install. The only problem I had with this product was the color. I have to say that it looked exactly like the photo that was provided. Sometimes pictures are a little darker than the actual color shown, but this one was very accurate and I was hoping the actual product would be a lighter color of cherry. Having said that, we deceided to keep it even though it was much more red than we would have liked it to be. Bottom line, it's comfortable and looks nice, and if you want a really dark cherry toilet seat, then this is the one."
3,yikes! this is not Natural Cherry Wood at ALL,"yikes! this is not Natural Cherry Wood at ALL. this is some kind of composite that is painted or finished with an odd reddish pattern having nothing to do with any kind of wood grain.if you are looking for a replacement cherry WOOD seat, you'll need to look elsewhere. I miss the cherry seats they used to sell at Home Depot. those seats looked like real wood. sadly they don't carry them any longer. wish I'd kept the mfr name."
1,"Burgundy-colored, doesn't even look like FAKE wood. Awful!","I didn't even take it out of the package before deciding it had to go back, but of course the plastic wrapping was so remarkably flimsy that merely holding it made it tear. Spend a little bit more and get this one, also available here, but from a Marketplace vendor, PlumberSurplus. (slow shipping, but it arrived packed well): Porcher 71018-00.670 Round Front Wood Core Toilet Seat, Natural Cherry"
2,Crappy condition,"It seems someone had spilled something on the book making it brittle and you can see the brown outline throughout the pages. But it's readable and that's all I needed.Besides that, the book came quick and I appreciate that.Thank you."
5,Won me much more than the price,"Before I read this I just tried to wait for good cards and hope for the best. The strategies in this book have finally made me a winning player -- and helped me understand exactly what it takes to make money in this game and move up from the low limits I currently play. As long as you aren't at my table, I recommend it!"
3,Good kids watch,Bought this for my 11 year old who always has trouble with straps and closings on previous watches. This one just clips onto the wrist and it has stayed on ever since. The bright color is attractive.It claimed to be the easiest watch in the world to set the time and date etc but I had trouble manipulating the hour / minute sequence and finally gave it up to someone else.Would recommend this watch for preteens / teens who want something practical and trendy at a good price.
3,Works okay but WD-40 is MUCH cheaper and seems to work just as well,"The instructions for my treadmill said to use ""Silicone lubricant or WD-40."" Both seem quite similar and both seem to lubricate the belt quite well, but WD-40 costs MUCH less. Before using WD-40 on your treadmill, be sure the manufacturer approves. Your treadmill may be made of different materials than mine."
2,Lubricant doesn't stop belt from catching/stopping.,"Sprayed it as directed underneath the belt of a treadmill that has started to stick/catch/grab. No discernible improvement seen. Tried spraying more, still no change. Doesn't seem to work."
3,??,Haven't had to apply the product as yet so I can't really rate it with by experience. I expect it to work okay.
5,Bought this for my trade Mill,I routinely use this on my trade Mill. Works as expect. I will buy again. Helps maintain belts. I use this about once every 3 months.
3,Where to Apply?,"I've used this lubrication several times on my treadmill but i can only apply under the outer edges of the belt track. I can't stretch the belt enough to spray the lub all the way inside the belt track. Is there a trick to this? Is there a ways to use something like the new WD-40 Smart Straw to lubricate the inside of the belt?WD-40 10032 Lubricant, Aerosol Can with Smart Straw, 12 Fluid Ounce. Would this product work? :3-In-One 10041 Silicone Spray Lubricant, Aerosol Can, 11 Fluid Ounce, 3"" OD, 2.63"" Length"
5,"Works Well, Easy To Use - Highly Recommended!","This LifeSpan ""Silicone Treadmill Belt Lubricant"" made an instant difference on my treadmill, reducing the squeaking and making the belt run a lot smoother over the bed. Applying about 1/4 of the bottle was enough to make the treadmill run like new.This was a great investment to help keep my treadmill running smoothly and hopefully also increasing the usable lifespan.Highly Recommended!CFH"
5,Great product,"I have an old Weslo Cadence 3250 treadmill and it was giving me problems with the speed setting. After walking on it for about 40 minutes it would start to slow down even when I adjusted the speed. I thought it was the motor dying on me but then I applied this product under the walking belt on the deck and it was like a new treadmill. Now I don't have to spend over $1000 on a new treadmill, I only paid $14.99 to fix the problem."
3,SILICONE TREADMILLL LUBRICANT!,"I ordered LifeSpan Silicone Treadmill Belt Lubricant because my treadmill wasn't working properly to find out I did not need it at all, apparently my Treadmill Belt doesn't have to be Lubricated. My machine was serviced and it works just fine. The Silicone I did send it back, I had no use for it. The Three stars rating is because of the size of the tiny little bottle and the Big Price!"
1,Utterly Worthless Book,"This is, easily, the single most useless how-to book I have ever encountered. It is merely a walk-through of a single, trivial example of one model construction. There are no in-depth analysis, no ""why"", and no mention of at least 75% of the features of the software..."
5,"Good product, bad seller","This item arrived in perfect condition. I previously tried to order this product directly from Fox 40, and had a terrible experience. They charged me for the product, never shipped the items and their customer service was unreachable. After six months and many, many emails, I eventually got a refund, had all my emails ignored and gave up on ever getting this much-needed item. Thanks to Amazon, I was finally able to order this whistle, which is required for my Swift Water Rescue Team, as we use them to give directions during water rescues. So, perfect product, recommended for outdoor enthusiasts, especially hikers, kayakers and fishermen; however, Fox 40 themselves get an ""F"" from me."
2,BLAND,"Have ordered many books by Gerald R. Allen, and was not impressed with this one. Was returned."
1,not worth it,in the news 5 years ago the truth came out that this man was a child molester. i don't want to suport him by buying his products. you shouldn't either.
4,Very pleasant,"re-hash of songs from the catalogues of The Choir, Daniel Amos, The 77's and Adam Again, all done unplugged. I haven't actually heard many of the originals, but these acoustic versions are a treat unto themselves. A nice selection of tunes and a worthwhile addition to the collection of fans of these bands."
2,hurts my ears!,"the demo singer on the cd is soooo nasal and horrible sounding! its hard to listen to! sorry who ever you are if you are reading this, im sure you are a nice person but i couldnt stand it! also the arrangements themselves are not so great. i love hymns and i hate it when people butcher them."
4,Very Pleased!,"Love the costume, material and details. The cape was off center and sown onto the top so no room for correction and being 5'2', 125 lbs and not at all very top heavy (34 B), the top did fit quite large from an ""extra small"" costume. The rest fit great, the skirt had elastic and did not pinch but also did not feel loose and the belt fit perfectly. Love the costume and regular delivery did not take long!"
2,Misleading but I worked it,"It was okay. I got a medium and it was too big. I am 5'10"" and 145 lbs. I thought that it would be right since I am pretty busty, but it was HUGE. I had to use pins to make it tighter and the clothes were wrinkly and there is no way you can really get them out. Also, the skirt had already had fabric coming unraveled, had to fix that too. The skirt was big too. NExt time I am going to get a small if I order from this company again. But I made it work, still looked cute. ;)"
1,Terrible!,"The item was old and had a very bad odor. I contacted the vendor, but received no response. I threw it away and will NEVER use this vendor again! If I could have given zero stars I would have."
1,Ugh,"This stuff is awful. The cream by mothers friend is smooth smells okay and works so well. This ""lotion"" is an oil. It smells so bad and after about a week of use it had broken me out. Buy the cream!"
5,"SoF 2, will be great!","From what Ive seen of SoF 2, in the multiplayer test, and what ive read on the internet, i believe this will be an incredible game. The game play in the multiplayer test is amazing, all the weapons look incredibly realistic and also the damage those weapons do. I admit, that the graphics arent as complex as i thought they would be, but as it says in the read me ""This is not a representation of the final version of the game."" To me, this says, that the final version will be much better than the test. With all the amazing technology being used in the game, and the optimum system requirements (1.5Ghz, 256mb RAM, and a high end processor) the graphics will be amazing, and with 70 levels of gameplay and the random scenario generator, it will be amazing!"
2,SOF2 BIG DISAPPOINTMENT,I have to admit I didn't play much of the game after I saw the graphics. NOT as good as the first SOF. Don't waste 50 bucks on this one.
2,What a waste of money!,"Being an avid fan of 1st person shooters, there are few I don't own. Soldier of Fortune (version 1) is a favorite of mine in the area of close combat and weapons variety. How wrong I was to buy the second verson SOF2. The AI is very poor, the graphics are plain, the weapons too common, the exits in missions far to hard to find, and the story line almost non-existant. This game (SOF2) in no way resembles its predessesor in game play or feel. SOF2 is a broken promise of great FPS gaming. Instead I recommend Rogue Spear Platinum Pack (Rogues Spear with Urban Operations)for its many weapons mods to try hundreds of different weapons. I also do recommend JK2JO (Jedi Knight II Jedi Outcast) and DFLW (Deltaforce 3 ""Landwarrior"")."
5,SOF I was great so should SOF II,"Well, Ive been playing the SOFII multiplayer test on the internet and love it. I thought the First SOF was great this one can only be better. Looking forward to getting it."
3,PC Gamer at 70% is just right.,"Unfinished and buggy, I played through twice, never again. This half finished mess is an insult. I would not pay $[money] for this mess, Serious Sam 2 is so much better in every way. I spent about 10 hours just getting it to run on my uber-comp. Shame on Raven for letting the B team release beta code on to the unsuspecting public under the smokescreen of E3. PC Gamer magazine rated SOF2 at 70% in the July 2002 issue and this is just what Raven deserves for unfinished buggy code."
2,Worst game on the quake 3 arena engine,"First off why does this game look so much worse than MOHAA, RTCW, and Jedi Outcast? Anyways the missions are boring and repetive. It has an outragous storyline. The missions don't have any real purpose until you beat the game and acually think about what you've done. The weapons are pretty close to real life. But the best feature of this game and SOF 1 is the gore. This game would be very boring without it. The muliplay is good, but it adds nothing new or revolutionary to the multiplayer enviroment. Overall is a VERY average game."
4,Great Multiplayer,"If you're tired of all cheating and tired BS from Counter Strike this is the game to get. Eventhough the single player can be frustrating and boring the awesome multiplayer gameplay more than make up for it. Its basically CS without all the camping, AWPers, dated graphics and slow gameplay. At times the gore in single player seems pointless, but oddly enough it is very fitting in multiplayer to see your opponents torn to pieces...very satisfying too :)Great game, worth the money for multiplayer alone."
2,Great program spoiled by bad data and stupid protection.,"I've been using this software every-day for two weeks now. It's ability to navigate you around while driving is great, and works really well. The ""turn coming up"" signals are clear and mean that you can concentrate on driving rather than having your face up to the screen. An alert for a missed turn (and automatic rerouting) would have been nice though.It only gets 2 stars because it has the world's worst copy protection and out-of-date maps.You have to key the software to a specific GPS unit, you have to have the CD in the drive (I've had to reinsert the CD many times to get it to be recognised).The maps are wrong! There are missing roads and mis-categorized roads, even from just using it for two weeks I've come across several errors. If you want to use it to find side-roads, good luck.Conclusion: Wait for Version 2, any hope that Magellan see sense about the copy-protection."
1,stupid copy protection scheme,"The software engineers at Magellan are idiots! I was told by magellan support that if you have a CD writer then the software will not work. Unfortunately, I found this out after I had purchased the software and tried to use it. All 3 of my computers have a CD writer and this software will not work on any of them!"
4,Direct Route,I have not had the problems others have noted getting the CD to work on my PC. I do suggest that you take the time to make region maps of the entire US and then save them to your hard drive. From there you can copy these to any other memory storage or hard drive. The software will let you rename your regions as long as you leave .IMG on the end (example Idaho.IMG)With a 512 SD card I was able to have 8 regions on my Magellan Gold GPS (I can only load one 64 mb region at a time but the Gold GPS will show all 8 regions in the menu).By saving these regions to my hard drive and using a SD card reader I could drop and drag my regions to the SD card.In closing I suggest you take some time while your CD is new andcreate all the map regions you will ever need and save them to your hard drive (and make a backup).
1,Cobra PR 3800 Radios- Overrated,"Tried these radios out while camping. Couldn't communicate one-half mile away from each other in wooded area. I realize I would not get 12 miles in the woods, but not even one-half mile. Come on.......Tried I the city, amount the same results. So where do you get the 12 miles???????I feel I was ripped off by this purchase. Extremely dissatisfied."
4,"Very good, Great Preformance.","These radios work very well. The other model the one the one under this I think its the 3500, has a better screen layout that I liked better. And some of the quality was better on the older model. But with this model I found a better preformance with signal. I pick up more signals and they were clearer on the 3800. So overall this is the best preformance radio. And rechargeable batteries with the stand, you can't beat that."
3,Too easy.,"This game looks great and plays and feels like any of the Legend of Zeldas for the Nintendo 64. However, the puzzles are not as difficult. Where difficulty does come in is trying to find certain switches, they sometimes blend into the board, or are in hard to find places. Minus the difficulty aspect the game probably has some of the best graphics of any gaming system out there. The only game that can surpass it is probably Resident Evil, which looks absolutely gorgeous. The game will take awhile even with the easiness, probably around 15-20 hrs depending on your skill. I would recomend this if you are a big Zelda fan, but don't get your hopes up for a game with challenging puzzles."
5,Star Fox RULES!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!,"A TERIFFIC game for (almost) all ages. Enough action to be fun but just the right amount that your mom won't kick ya off. A game of puzzling challenges, great graphics, not a half-bad plot, and Fox McCloud has some of the coolest martial arts moves ever witnessed by gamers eyes! Buy this game now!!!!!"
4,The true successor to Ocarina of Time,"Very familiar gameplay to fans of either of the Zelda 64's. Fun, but not hard. However, absolutely no replay value. Once you beat it, you are done."
3,Could use some work...,First of all there are so many levels! how can u tell if ur even close 2 beating the game without any1 or nething telling u!Kyrstal cant do anything at the beginning of the game! thats just low! since u can still ride in the ships and other vehicles and walk on foot (for once) the game is actually ok.
2,What a shame.,"I was really looking forward to this game... I'm very disappointed Rare. This is a game that's all show and no great game-play. Based on a basic Zelda controll scheme, this is a mediocre adventure with little action. For a game that's been in production for 3 years it's incredibly short: you can finish the game in one weekend. The only thing that saved this game from a 1 is it's superior graphics. But if that's what I wanted, I'd save my money for Halo 2. In short, Krystal=hot, this game=not."
5,incredible game,"Great graphics, good music, and great gameplay. You don't have to backtrack very much (always a good thing). The combat is a little too easy, but the game is more about problem-solving. It's pretty much a Zelda clone, but I like it much more than the Zelda games. The environments are all really great, and you get different abilities throughout the game so it stays interesting. I guess it's a medium length game, but I was so addicted to it that it didn't take me more than a couple weeks.I had played the old Star Fox games for N64 and SNES, and I was a little disappointed that this one didn't have very much aerial combat. But then again, I wasn't expecting much, and I don't think the game really needed it to be great.It's worth getting a Gamecube just for this game and Super Smash Bros Melee."
1,Easy,This game is cheese. your grandma could beat this game i bet. if you like a game that takes no brains and no thinking this games for you
2,Starts out fun but becomes boring,"When I first got Star Fox I thought it was great! It was fun, hard, interesting and cool. Then when I got towards the end it got boring. It really is a bad game. If you are someone who starts to like a video game then doesn't like it you will not like this video game. I would not recommend this to most people."
2,Rather dissapointing,"Well, there's really not much to say about this game. I loved the first two Star Fox games, but this is, at best, mediocre.First off, the whole Dinosaur Planet thing was nonsense. Of course, the games have always been a bit cheesy (a fighter pilot fox?) but this takes the cake.But the most obvious problem is the fact that, as someone stated before, it tries to be Zelda... but it isn't.Let's leave the platforming to Link, and keep Star Fox doing what he does best... flying around and shooting things. Now that's fun!"
2,bitter coffee,This coffe is very bitter. It smell better than GM International. Much to bitter for me. I put 6 packets of sweetener and it is still bitter. I canceled this coffee from my subcribe and save.
1,Not so good,Bought a whole case of this stuff so that I could get free shipping. I had to make myself drink it so that it wasn't a total loss. I will not order this again. Really not that great :(
3,What Love Is About,It was the hardships of a young couple and their struggles of keeping a family together.
4,An Excellent Debut,"This actually deserves 4.5 stars, but I couldn't quite justify giving it a 5 star rating. Full of great pop songs that are hard not to sing along with. Personal favorites include Smash This World, Lame To Be, Afterall. Still very relevant and listenable after five years."
3,Moderation is in order,"This is album is neither lousy nor a five-star classic that will live on in our hearts and souls for all time. What it is is fun, simple yet varied, lyrically diverse, bouncy, brief, and an altogether enjoyable if not compelling album. My main gripe is the usual 36-minute ""we want more"" line. The songs themselves are usually on the chronologically conservative side as well. They make interesting use of vocal harmonization but sing only marginally better than Ben Folds."
5,What boy doesn't like baseball cards,"My eight year old son had hours of fun opening them. He said the gum was awful...25 year old trading card gum. Other than that, great gift for a sports nut child. I couldn't believe that these would be available. He wants more for Christmas."
3,Grandson's request,"Our 5 year old grandson decided he wanted baseball cards. These cards were in a box and lots of them but many were sets of the same player. These are more for an older child who would trade them with friends. We only gave one of each set in our grandson's stocking. The gum enclosed was thrown out as if they are as old as indicated, the gum would be too. It was really not for a 5 year old. It does show a child how they were packaged back in the day when you bought Fleers gum with the players card."
4,A Very Overlooked Album By An Overlooked Band,"In the days of big hair and big rockin' hits there were many great bands that were overlooked...This was the case with Salty Dog, I was blown away when i first heard this group, I was in junior high and a friend of mine turned me on to this album, of course that was back in the days when cassettes were the big thing, Side B of the cassette was undoubtably better than Side A, So I guess the last five or six tracks on the cd are the choice cuts. ""Lonesome Fool"" my favorite song on the album is worth checking out just for the banjo....thats right, I said banjo. Also ""Sacrifice Me"" is a killer power ballad (how was this song not a hit?)....So if you were into Kix, Skid Row, Slaughter & Britny Fox..Here's one you will dig."
3,Not what I had hoped for but still a good value.,This product is okay. It is not as thick as a pitching rubber should be. Probably half the thickness. My fault I guess for not carefully reading the dimensions. I thought these type of things were standard.
2,No good biomedical help here,"So many ASD kids are sick with bowel disease and live in terrible pain. This book only covers the bare minimum of ASD issues and deals effectively only with ABA treatment. Sadly, it takes far more to recover many children than ABA. Ms. Siff-Exhorn's book oversimplifies the very complex causes and medical problems that all too often go untreated or are simply viewed as behavioral."
4,Pricey,Price was a little high but this item has saved my bacon a few times. Don't use very often but when needed I would pay a lot more to remedy the problem.
3,I really appreciated the convenience of the larger-sized ...,"I really appreciated the convenience of the larger-sized box, since it meant fewer boxes to buy and store. The Curity pads were very absorbent and gave excellent wetness protection. However, I wasn't as comfortable wearing these as with my usual contoured pad. They felt bulkier and showed more under my clothes. Their texture was like tissue paper and the blue liner, while being very absorbent, made these pads slip around more while my son nursed. Although this was a decent product, I wasn't convinced I should switch from the other pads I've always used."
1,These Pads Stink!!!,I tried these pads and they are crappy! I soaked through these things in less than 4 hours. After that I doubled them up and I still soaked the two ply I created. I'm sorry I bought these. I will stick with the Lansinoh pads. They work better.
4,"worked for six years, keeps small area liquid","This works pretty well. It keeps a small area open, although if there is a strong wind, it sometimes cannot do that. All and all, it's acceptable. The one I bought six years ago just stopped working, and I am getting another one to replace it."
1,Tripped the GFCI on the first use.,"I bought this in September, 2012. First weather for using it came in January, 2013. Filled the bird bath, plugged in the de-icer, all according to the instructions. The next morning we discovered that the de-icer had tripped the ground fault circuit interrupter, the bird bath was a solid block of ice, the freezer on that circuit was thawed, and it's too late to return the de-icer! We tried several times, each time tripping the GFCI when no other appliance did that. This brand new de-icer must have come with a short in it. A very unsatisfied customer."
3,Works pretty well,"I was somewhat disappointed with this birdbath heater. For starters, it is a monster and you need a very large deep birdbath to use this in. The cord is very stiff and makes it hard to place into the birdbath. On the other hand it keeps the water unfrozen and doesn't seem to evaporate the water too fast unlike another heater that I have."
2,Okay if you don't live in a very cold place,This product works only when the weather isn't very cold. When temperatures are in the single digits or teens the water in the birdbath is frozen with a small thawed area where the ice eliminator is. I'm pretty disappointed in this product.
4,Good so far,"I bought this to replace an old one that worked for 3 years. I've only had this one for less than 6 months, but it works well. I was surprised to see the unfrozen water in the birdbath when it was below the top of the de-icer. My only complaint is that the cord is not long enough, so I had to use a short extension to reach the outlet. I would recommend this to a friend."
4,Keeps water available year round,"This item does the trick in keeping water available for birds even when it is freezing temps outside. Connect to an extension cord and plug in, and the birds will keep coming year round."
2,Item defective,"This was the second ones that I've had the first one was marginal in the fact that it barely kept the water from freezing, (it barely kept a small part from freezing Our Illinois winters are too cold for this item.) and the second one was defective. I will say that Amazon made it extremely easy to return. The next one I order will have a higher wattage."
4,K&H 9000 Ice Eliminator,"It works for us in the 20 - 30's. In the teens, we had ice form on the sides of the bath, but still had an opening. We like the size, low wattage and thermostat."
2,Not in central Oregon,"We have a 2+ gal circulating oriental style pond that has the waterfall into a recess cut into a large rock then tumbling onto other smaller rocks before returning to its base to be recirculated again. I counted eighteen birds in the pond or waiting there turn. Normally we remove the pump in early Nov. and leave it dry until Spring ( Ha )not hear in central Oregon. Well until March or April. However when I saw all the birds this year I decided to try and heat the water so it wouldn't freeze. Well this heater is under powered (50W). Ice is forming already and we do not have any snow yet this year. It might work in a still pond where you add water every day. Weather here is usually 20s > high 30s during winter. Sometimes (not to often) down to 0 at night. I just purchased a 250W heater from ACE hardware. Its referred to as a ""DE-icier"". I will update this at a later time. Hope this helps your birds."
4,Super Colossal Smash Hits of the 90's: The Best of the Mavericks,"Classic Maverick music and style with some songs that where not produced for sale in the states. I enjoyed the CD myself, but I like the Maverick's"
2,No words of wisdom here.,"Spend the money on a good basic sea kayakingbook. There are some good ones out there, butthis is not one of them."
3,Mildly Amusing,"A kind of vaguely amusing story about a stumbling, bumbling, New York copyeditor who is the most gullible ""mark"" around. The victim of every short (small) and long (large) con known to man, our hero is in really big trouble when he inherits a cool half-million from a long-lost uncle. Suddenly people are shooting at him, girls are all over him, and he's not sure if he can trust his pal in the bunco (fraud) division. Needless to say, there are many twists and turns in this wry tale."
4,BUY A SIZE (or two) LARGER,I got the M/L size and according to the size chart it should fit but did not. I would have reordered the size larger but they wanted to charge almost twice the price for a size larger. Ended up ordering the Cobra hat which is also nice and of the same quality for $8 less.
4,Washed Hats / Beige,"I truly like this hat, I'd had an old fisherman hat around the house similar to this one and had grown accustomed to wearing it, when I misplaced it. I was very hesitant about ordering a new one. But after looking at this hat I new it would be perfect. Once I'd received the hat I knew it was a good choice. My only complaint was that the size was a little too big. I would eventually wind up giving it to my wife (who actually wanted it anyway) and she truly adores it. As it turns out I wound up finding my old hat and now my wife and I go out together looking like twins."
4,Very Cute.,"This book is very cute, and helps to remind you what you'll want to save to look back on for years to come, but I agree that it could have pockets or something else to keep items in rather than having to glue/stick them to the pages."
4,Chronicles of the Host 4,I like the way the author writes. Creative imagination and follows scripture very well.
4,Good product.,"Good product, worth the money paid, put it on my 2002 two door tracker. It works good and is much thicker than the regular ""car"" shocks it had before. These truck/suv shocks make it more steady when bouncing on turns since before it would fishtail but not with these."
5,Awesome Read,This was one of the best books that I have ever read. I am from NJ and have been vacationing on Long Beach Island my whole life and love it there. It is always awesome to be able to read a book and to be able to picture everything that is being talked about. Which made it that much more real. This book was very well written and grabs the readers attention right from the beginning. I couldn't put it down.
3,whitfield 'live',"recording quality is faireveryone is a monster player but no one is really 'saying ' anything,speaking to the soul.Just a technical muscle show..wow the audience with flurries of notes and get 'house'.."
3,Websdale's exploratory analysis,"The format of this book is basically to relate existent research on all forms of domestic homicide to a sample of cases taken from archival records collected for one year in Florida. The analysis is mainly descriptive and exploratory (feels like an ethnography, but not). For instance, chapters basically are organized around discussing existent research in the context of examples of several case studies (developed out of archival research that includes newspaper clippings - it seems - not very explicit about method here). The theoretical slant is feminist (patriarchal) and somewhat conflict (focuses very much on marginalized statuses of both offenders and victims). Websdale offers several tables on Sex-ratios of killings, race ratios and on the major independent variables thought to be associated with DH. First and last chapter have the most substance. In sum, very readable and interesting, but if you're looking for a thorough quantitative analysis - look elsewhere."
5,Perfect,"You can't fit more emotions into one movie! This movie was put together perfectly, with the right combination of comedy and drama. I reccomend this movie to anyone!"
4,WHY THIS MOVIE FLOPPED IS BEYOND ME,SOMEONE TOLD ME BOX OFFICE HAS NOTHING TO DO WITH THE QUALITY OF A MOVIE. SIMON BIRCH PROVES THAT POINT. THE MOVIE WILL MAKE YOU HAPPY DESPITE THE EVENTUAL SAD ENDING. A NICE CAMEO BY JIM CARREY ADDS UP TO A GREAT MOVIE.
5,Great things come small.,"This is a very good movie. the first time i went to watch it i thought it would be very boring but it wasint. it made me laugh and yes it made me cry. belive me i am not a cryer it takes an extreamly good movie for me to cry. this movie is great for everyone. it really makes you think, great things come in small packages."
1,"Warning, should be PG-13 rating",I heard so many rave reviews that I rented this movie to watch with my family. After watching about 10 minutes we had to turn it off and wait for a time when my 4 and 6 yo were sleeping. This movie has a lot of language and sexual innuendo. So buyers beware.
5,best movie I have ever seen...,"I have seen this movie no less than 20 times, and enjoy it every time. It unfolds like a good book, a page at a time. It has drama, humor, suspense, and tear-jerking scenes. I'm not sure why it didn't receive more acclaim than it did, but Ian Michael Smith is one great actor and deserved recognition. He makes the film."
1,the worst movie without doubt,i watched this movie about three times in middle school and it is the worst movie i have ever seen. period.
5,A truly great family film.,"Simon Birch isn't your typical Hollywood movie. It has a low body count, no real romance, no big name stars, and a story that is centered on outcasts. This doesn't sound like the makings of a successful movie.However, Simon Birch is one of the most memorable movies I've come across in years. It is a story about kids that has a true feeling to it (sort of like ""A Christmas Story""). It has a feeling of real friendship like the movie ""Stand By Me"". It manages to be original, bust-a-gut funny, and sad all at the same time.I was shocked to read some of the reviews of Simon Birch after I had seen the movie. The critics definitely had a mixed view of Simon Birch. I guess this shows what I've suspected for a long time, movie critics wouldn't know a good movie if it hit them in the head with a baseball."
1,For those who have read Owen Meany,"This is a note to those of you who have read A Prayer for Owen Meany:This movie does not do the book justice at all. For some reason, wonderful plot points are removed and replaced with trite silliness. If you have read the book and want to see the movie, rent it. It will be very disappointing for you to buy it.For those who have not read it but are reading this, I recommend the book. It is a wonderful book. The movie might have been all right had I not read the book, but in comparison, it is awful."
5,"Drama, Inspiring, comics!","I just love Simon Birch...adorable! I recommend this to friends and family. I laughed, cried...and entertained.Highly recommended."
5,love love Simon birch,One of my very most favorite movies ever. Moving on a lot of different levels. Grab your children and have them watch it with you.
3,The Granite Mouse,"Clever, comely, corny and cute. ""Simon Birch"" is a comedy-drama loosely based on ""A Prayer for Owen Meany"" by John Irving. The movie is at its best when it is funny. When it tries to be serious, it presents a vague, Hollywood faith-in-faith message combined with implausible melodrama. Overall, the clever, comely, cute side is enough to make it worthwhile. My favorite scene is the first appearance of ""The Prop"". Rated PG for language, thematic elements and an intense accident scene."
3,Questionable...,"Mrs. Lavigne delivered an excellent second single for the sophomore album ""Under My Skin"". ""My Happy Ending"" was damn catchy, you can't refuse this... But this song is nearly over dramatic. Besides the ""Homelessness is bad"" message, the music video doesn't fail to impress. But still... ""Under My Skin"" can do a better job in singles than this."
3,Good not Great!,"This is the sequel to Warprize, which was one of the best of this type of genre that I've read in a long time, and a debut novel at that. If you have not read Warprize you need to do that b/4 reading this one. Warsworn takes up where Warprize leaves off. However, it is not as good. Warsworn is about the march through Lara's kingdom and about the couple trying to get to know each other. However, Lara in her ignorance and elevated self worth (she seems to think she knows best at all times) makes some very not just stupid but deadly mistakes, that cost Keir's army many lives, and threatens Keir's status amongst his people.While I liked both Lara and Keir in the first book, I wanted to toss Lara into a funeral pyre in the second book for her stupidity. Keir continues to be an interesting character and I can only hope the third and final book in the series redeems Lara's character to justify her being a Warprize."
4,"Not as good as #1, but still a decent read","This is simply an amazing series. I agree with other reviewers that the first book was better, AND I very much look forward to #3. But #2 is still a good read. There were some inconsistencies, and it moved a bit slowly. But the characters are so special you just want to drink them in. Do NOT miss this series! This author has quite a future ahead of her!"
3,second of a trilogy by Elizabeth Vaughn,"Warsworn was #2 in the trilogy, begun by Warprize. In Warsworn, Lara learns that her highly prized healing skills cannot beat a dangerously changed plague. Her Warlord loses 10% of his army but they soldier on to their way to the central plains. Actually this was a smallish book and all three books together would have made one of those nose busting very highly satisfying books to have at bedside for reading. If I had 360 million dollars I would get this made into what I believe would be one of those Hollywood blockbusters. And speaking of Hollywood, does no one there READ? Um apparently not."
5,excellent,This book is especially excellent and helpful. It comes from a unique approach that gets to the root of patterns in our lives that affect our marriages. I highly recommend this book.
5,Hits the nail on the head,"I've read books before that ""categorize"" your personality type, etc, and I have never heard anyone describe me... until I read this book. They nailed my personality or ""love style"", based on how I was raised. It really gave me insight into WHY I do things the way I do. And not only that, but it showed me HOW to work on those areas that need work. Great book... I am buying a copy of the book and workbook for some friends who are getting married. What better way to start off marriage, than to understand yourself better, before trying to understand someone else?! This book has also helped me understand my husband better too and be more compassionate and understanding of him. :)"
1,Small opening,"I bought this model locally and installed it last night. It replaces an unknown brand of wooden seat.This morning when I first used it, it felt a little snug (male) although it looked great. So I measured the interior opening - 9.0 inches back to front and 8.0 inches side to side. Actually, it may be 9 15/16 by 7 15/16.My old seat measurements 10 inches back to front and 8.75 inches side to side.It matters to me. I just wasted a lot more than Amazon charges for this model and now I have to go shopping again at a larger store.BTW I've been buying a new wooden seat every few years and this is the first time I encountered this size.Boo!"
1,not as described and very uncomfortable...UGH,"This seat is flat and does not feel comfortable to sit on...it is like sitting on a board....BUT the worst is that the ""brushed nickel"" is some kind of junk metal sprayed to look like nickel and the paint is all flaking off.....I should have returned it immediately but thought I could live with it... I would have done but the paint peeling off is the last straw...DO NOT BUY this product.....find a better choice....my thought would be a brand name with brass fittings......"
1,"Small Opening, Poor Construction, But It Looks Good","This seat has a small round opening, rather than an oval opening like some others for my round bowl. It is made of about 2 inch wide pieces of wood glued together. The pieces started to seperate almost as soon as I received it. The item was returned and I went to Home Depot and picked one up. It's too bad because this seat looked great."
2,Short Lived,"I purchased this item just seven months ago and parts have already worn out. The seat still looks exquisite, but under the seat, the supports which keep the wooden seat off of the Porcelain thrown are in pieces. A very poor buy."
5,One of the last things made out of real wood and brass,One of the last things made out of real wood and brass - when you order this you will not be disappointed.
2,Oh so much wasted hope. . .,"...Just bought the game tonight and I already hate it. Where to begin? The awkward controls (jumping is a hassle)? The crowded, overdrawn-on jungles (lush environments, my eye - you can't see 2 ft ahead of you)? How about the much hailed enemy AI? They're smart enough to miss you with every shot and not respond when you're mere inches away.All this awesomeness in the very first level.And don't get me started on the flying levels! Alright, maybe just a little. It's almost as if you have precious little control over the behemoth in the sky, and targeting enemies is damn near impossible.Que terrible!Please oh please for the love of all that is holy keep your money for a better game. Or better still get the original for the 64. This version just plains eats it."
2,Bastard Child of the Turok Series,"I owned Turok 1 and 2 for the old N64 and thought they were great, so I was really looking forward to this game. Unfortunately, this one isn't even as good as the old N64 ones. The graphics may be a little better, but the game itself isn't nearly as fun. Plus, the things that they added to ""improve"" the series are just plain stupid, like the flying missions (you have a pterydactyl that shoots missles and machine guns). I am going to trade this one in toward Timesplitters 2."
2,Not Even Close to Halo!,"With all the hype on this game, I really expected to be playing a fasinating game like Halo. To my surprise, it turned out to be less than exciting, if that. The graphics are not even close, the game play and control are both lacking and I got to wondering if they really beta tested the game at all, or were they jumping ahead to make the bucks. A real disappointment. It could have been the best, but continual frame skips, lack of character control and no save feature make it a hard game to enjoy. And is'nt having FUN the purpose of a game anyway!? Too Bad!"
3,"The qualities of ""Turok Evolution""","What's hot:-Decent gameplay-Gruesome dismembering and decapitatonWhat's not:-Those are some really ugly graphics-Controlling the Pterosaur can give you the creepsWhat's strange:-Why does the act of butchering your enemies have to look so fake?-Could the Pterosaur work on its turning?The awards for:Scariest enemy:The T-rexWorst weapon: The shotgunThe overall:If you like to hunt down dinosaurs, this is your game. Otherwise, just don't bother with this at all."
3,This game needs help,"Great Graphics and gameplay, but it is confusing, and there are no specific objectives."
4,Turok Evolution - Fantastic Graphics.,"Graphics - Awesome. Amazing vegetation. I shot a tree branched and heard and watched it fall. Touch plants and they will sway.Sound - Will make you jump out of your skin sometimes. Good music. Nice surround effects to make you feel like you are ""in the game"".Gameplay - Very good. My only complaint is I wish there were more save points on some levels. Like the Summit Battle.This game is a must buy."
1,Turok,"Is any body having troubles with this game jamming up with a sign saying drity or damaged dic? I have other xbox games that do it also but not like Turok does! I don't know if it's the xbox or the game! As much as I've been able to play it's a fun game, I just don't get to play it for long!!"
3,Could of been a great game.,I thought this game was going to be amazing like the first 2 Turoks. I was wrong. The game just doesn't feel like a turok game. It seems totally different to me. It is a good game but not what I was expecting. The graphics are good but nothing amazing like other Xbox games. I don't know about other copies but my game seems defective. On Chapter 4 at the end everybody seems to turn invincible and I cant kill them but they can kill me. On another level I will be running through the midle of the level and suddenly blow up. This game is good for someone who likes shooting games but it's a dissapointment for the Turok Fans.
2,Yokooso I & II,"Sure, you learn some grammar points. But what happens when you want to look them up again, or refresh your memory. The index and table of contents are horrible. I had to write it all in by hand, just so I could find it again."
5,works great - especially for sweaty people! (ha),"I get an occasional flare up of athlete's foot.. probably from the gym locker room and my feet do get sweaty.Anyway, this powder starts to relieve the symptoms after just a couple of days. You might be tempted to stop using it once the terribly itching and irritation goes away, but you really should stick with the recommended durationto make sure you have really gotten rid of everything, or else it will just come back eventually."
4,"kind of slow with filler tracks, but very notable peaks","thats about it. the only tracks, to me at least, that stand out are ""crystal"" by i forget who, nylon's track, and i ching's track. funny, i always thought i ching was a new age group, but maybe theres more than one."
3,Good device,"The LifeSpan Stretch Partner is a machine I use in conjunction with other stretching devices to maintain flexibility. I am 58-years-old and being flexible become more important each passing year. A person could do the same routine from the floor and without the machine, but I have found that having it provides more motivation. My only complaint would be that this machine seems to be designed for a woman or smaller-than-average person."
4,Lifespan Fitness sp1000,"I bought this for home use because the Precor was $200. more. Its fine for stretching but I don""t like the movable handle, not necessary, and I feel the padded seats will crack. It's ok but still too expensive for what you get. I should have gotten the Precor Stretch Trainer."
3,Dissapointed,This book is a lot thinner than I expected. It has a few good ideas. I was looking forward to more though.
4,Awesome!,This razor is fantastic. I'm getting an amazingly close shave every time and - to all of those who aren't - you must not be doing it right!!! Shaving is so much faster with this razor because you don't have to waste time lathering up with shaving gel/cream...and because this is a Venus product - you are getting a great shave. The gel smells nice too...not very strong...but...clean smelling<3
3,More good than bad...,"I recently bought this razor with high hopes and wound up being mildly disappointed. It is by no means bad, but it has some serious flaws. The biggest frustration for me was that the gel bars are very bulky and I have a hard time getting a close shave. I have to go over my legs several times.On the positive side, the gel itself was really rather nice, but I had to let it run under the water for a while to get any sort of lather going. It wasn't too ""foamy"", and it had a pleasant smell. Wonderfully, my legs were not irritated at all after shaving, which is a problem I have had with many other razors. Overall, I'd say this is an okay razor, especially for people who have sensitive skin!"
2,It BURNZES US!!!,"I used this product once on my armpits and legs and thought it was great, especially because the way the strips on either side of the razor, and the razor head itself, kind of maneuver in a way that I didn't cut myself on my ankle, when if I was using my normal razor, I definitely would have. I got a close shave and didn't have any problems with irritation later. However, after using it 3 days later for the second time, it seems as though the strips lost their lube and although the razor head itself was still better than the one I have been using, I would definitely say I wish I'd used some shave gel because my legs are on fire. (even after applying my ""soothing"" lotion generously.) So... if you have enough money to buy a new razor cartridge every time you use it, or if you want to reuse a blade with shaving gel and open a new cartridge on the days you're in an extra hurry, then why not... I personally don't have the cash!"
4,Bluegrass alternative,"I first heard a couple of songs by her on hidef TV. Was very pleased and soon ordered the original version and this one, as I like bluegrass. While this is very good, I must confess I prefer the original version. But from a stickly bluegrass point of view this one is worth a listen, and many will likely prefer this one... Great voice, sonically it is excellent, with good presence. Excellent recording."
5,You Must Get This Album!,"I absolutely love Laura Fuentes' music in Delicadeza! This album is great...all the songs are so beautiful. If you enjoy Latin American folk music, you will not be disappointed. Her voice and the instruments are a perfect combination. Enjoy!"
1,THIS DVD SUCKS,"LET ME PREFACE THIS REVIEW. I OWN OVER 200 DVD CONCERTS AND I CAN'T BELEIVE PEOPLE RATE THIS 4 OR 5 STARS. I MUST BE WATCHING A DIFFERENT VERSION OF THIS SHOW. FIRST AND FORMOST, THE LEAD SINGER IS REALLY BAD ! I COULDN'T UNDERSTAND A WORD HE WAS SINGING. SECONDLY , I DON'T NEED A CHEEZY VIDEO OF THE GROUP AND SAN FRANCISCO DURING SOME OF THE BEST MUSIC ON THE DVD. I BUY DVD'S OF CONCERTS BECAUSE I CAN'T MAKE IT TO THE SHOW. I DON'T NEED AIMLESS ARTWORK AND ARTSY FILLER. GIVE ME THE SHOW!!! IS THAT TOO MUCH TO ASK FOR?. THAT SAID, DON'T WASTE YOUR TIME AND MONEY ON THIS AIMLESS AN POINTLESS CONCERT.THERE WAS A REASON THIS BAND SPLIT UP AND IF YOU BUY THIS DVD YOU'LL FIND OUT WHY..................."
2,not believable,"Kline is miscast, Spacey's given too much rope, and the plot - especially the second half - is one gigantic stretch after another. The actresses are good, and the singer terrific, but it's not enough. EG Marshall's character isn't needed, and Forrest Whitaker's isn't consistent. Too many holes to recommend. For hardcore K-Space fans only."
2,Not a bad idea but tailed off towards the end,"I have to say about this film that although it's not the kind of film I really rate, it had a couple of startling moments with the initial set-up etc. I liked the idea up to a point but then by the end it was just like 'oh just finish this up in the usual way' with a totally run-of-the-mill climax. The film seemed to just run out of steam as time went on. That's the problem with a lot of thrillers is that it's hard for the ending to live up to the pace of what precedes it. A shame, but nevertheless the film had unintentional comic worth in that last showdown between Kline and Spacey(I challenge anyone to keep a straight face where Spacey egotistically challenges Kline 'Come on. COME TO PAPA!')"
3,not so great,"Not as many good ideas. I was hoping for 100 different layout options, but it was ways to use layout, embellishments, etc, not just layouts. Book was kind of cheesy"
3,Wow. Not for the Timid.,"Violent, bloody, gory - and not very well done. Sorry. This film is a prequel to Stevan Mena's first film, Malevolence, another not that great movie, both are about psycho killers, typical slasher movie stuff. The concept itself is interesting - a character study on how a psychopathic killer is crafted under the tutelage of another psychopathic character, but I'm always leery of movies that are directed, produced, written, and even scored by one person - if there's no one around to tell y ou ""No"" - how do you know you're not making crap?"
1,SICKEST OF THE SICKEST!,SICK !DONT WATCH THIS MOVIE.SICKEST OF THE SICKEST.FRED KRUEGER SEEMS LIKE A DISNEY CARTOON COMPARED TO THIS SENSELESS BLOODSHED.ONLY A SICK MIND CAN CREAT SUCH A HORROR.THE DEVIL MUST LOVE THIS MOVIE SINCE ONLY EVIL PREVAILS IN IT.
1,This is one sick movie,"This movie is on the same sick level as the ""Saw"" movie series.... bloody, cold, violent and sick. I actually had a hard time watching it but wanted to see it through to the end so I could properly review it. I know there are those who enjoy watching this kind of movie, but it just isn't something I can recommend. This movie shows the brutal killing of numerous innocent victims over many years. The torture and fear the victims endured were equally sickening. I would urge everyone to avoid this senseless, sick movie. Whereas it may depict some degenerate part of our society I don't think we need to memorialize it on DVD."
4,Sterline Silver Mens Solid Designer Bar Link Bracelet,Sterling Silver Mens Solid Designer Bar Link Bracelet 8.5Well satisfied with the quality of the subject item and very pleased with the timely shipment.
1,Amateur hour .............,"This is so unsophisticated. Alfred is a good drummer, but the drumming dominates and more instrumentation is needed to balance it. Poor production and mostly uninteresting tunes don't help."
4,Nice Toe Ring,"I have worn this toe ring for several years now without ever taking it off!! It never tarnishes, has held up through socks and shoes of all seasons. It is even comfortable on my foot while wearing pantyhose and working at a busy restaurant! The only reason I gave it 4 stars is that is sometimes doesn't hold its shape and the front gets pinched up a little and I have to squeeze it back, but I think that would happen with any toe ring you wear all the time! It is also very pretty and I get a lot of compliments on it!"
4,Oro - Golden in any language,"ABBA in the seventies was a musical juggernaut sweeping the top 40 of mostly all international markets. South/Latin America though was not one of these markets. So ABBA decided then to re-release their songs in Spanish. The result was a smashing success that created a loyal fan base.While Fernando, Chiquitita, and Mamma Mia translated quite fine, their version of ""Conociendome, Conociendote"" or ""Knowing Me, Knowing You"" was a little tougher, but still sounds good. Hasta Manana and Andante, Andante are two very pleasant and personal songs that hit that nerve previous hits accomplished. Even to the untrained Spanish speaker, Agnetha and Frida still sound very well."
4,Gearhead to Gear-Geek,"I enjoyed the book. I found it very helpful in understanding the elements of an engine management system. I wanted to better understand my car's brain and decide whether I wanted to tinker with its software or not.My next step is to look into programming software packages and programmer units- thanks to reading this book, I feel good about taking the next step: brain surgery on a supercharged iron beast."
5,I got everthing I needed here,"This has been money well spent,I am happy I got it and everyone who cant leave their car alone should own it. Not for the faint hearted or old fashioned fuel injection systems.Update Jan 6th 2010--- I got the two engine management tuning books by greg banish yesterday and within a few chapters knew who had written the bible of EFI tuning. Sorry Jeff hartman but greg banish is THE MAN."
3,Good Old Days Thrift,"This was fairly interesting, but not anything I have not encountered in numerous other ""old time"" publications at Amazon. It wuld be more interesting to someone who was new to the subject"
2,Not Very Good,"Works well for a little while before it disconnects. It disconnects every 1-10 minutes and takes a while to reconnect, if it ever does. Very annoying!"
4,Good Little Mouse,The mouse connects well via Bluetooth and reconnects every time. Gave the 4 star rating because it does not read well on every surface and seems a bit jerky if not on a mousepad or surface with lots of variation.
1,A mediocre and lackluster compilation.,"He was nowhere near as good a Soul singer as Teddy Pendergrass, Lou Rawls, Al Green, Peabo Bryson or Johnnie Taylor but this compilation has its moments. This compilation's sound quality also leaves plenty to be desired and it's very unimpressive in comparison to other Malaco titles."
2,"Slept, but with aweful dreams","I received the product in great condition, but the product did not work for me. Gave me awful nightmares and I woke up allot."
1,Terrible Recording Quality,I like the original Delta Sleep System CD. This one is not good. The first track ends abruptly. Then the second track begins LOUDLY no matter how soft the volume is set. Am I supposed to be able to sleep through that? It wakes me up every time.
5,Not just for software,"The idea that many situations have overlapping problem & solution domains is immensely valuable. Using some of the ideas in other situations, especially with young people, has generated better solutions than I ever imagined possible.Give a copy to your favorite school teacher or city government official -- with the obvious caveat of course."
2,Overly bright mastering,"Of the three readily available masterings of this performance, I rate this the worst. Although it is brighter than the EMI, and this makes it seem initially better, the highs are so shrill that it is literally painful to hear at times. The EMI goes the other direction, but at least it doesn't hurt. Although it is twice the price of the Gebhardt, the Pristine Classical has a natural balance of frequencies. Those who love this performance should go for the Pristine version."
1,"A Lot of People Like This, But It Didn't Work For Me","The firewall was difficult to manage, I couldn't easily get the antivirus and some other parts disabled for more than a brief time; I didn't keep it.Subsequent comment: I later learned that Norton and CyberSitter don't get along, and since I have CyberSitter, perhaps that's why Norton wouldn't work well."
4,Not everyone will enjoy this book.,"I bought this book when I was homeschooling my 5th grade son. I had already read a copy from the library and thought it would go good with our Middle Ages History lessons since there isn't a whole lot about Alfred the Great for Middle Schoolers. Though it was written for his age originally it didn't grab my sons attention. I eventually let him stop when I saw it wasn't accomplishing its intended goal. We went on to other, newer books that did keep his attention. Recommend Door in the Wall, (not about Alfred the Great, but good Middle Ages book)."
5,"Informative, but To The Point",This VHS is a quick and simple way to understanding the psychology involved with Road Rage.I would like to recomend this product to anyone interested in driving courses and behavior on the road.
3,not really a security book,"the book is not really a security or hacking book. covers technology basics well and very humorous at times. so what's the point? author has written better books, have to give him that. very disappointed, i had higher expectations."
3,Targeted audience,"This book is targeted for business people. As a CISSP, there wasn't much surprising here, but a lot of information that might help cut down on the mythology surrounding security (i.e. firewall=security). I bought this based on the author's reputation and based on that I'll finish it, but any engineers that are used to reading technical books will find the manner of writing frustrating; non-geeks will appreciate the plain English.To be fair, slashdot gave it a 10."
4,Book stradles both worlds: academia and corporate world ...,"of IT Security.While Bruce Schneider rehashes old ideas discussed in his other IT Sec books, this read is well organized, with lots of practical examples and quite thorough in his extensive coverage of all security measures.The best thing about this book is how the presentation of various IT Security measures makes the reader aware of how imporatnt security policies are and what the important aspects of security management are. This read is definitely beneficial for IT and Security managers.When reading this book I could not help but get annoyed with how verbose this book is. One could easily eliminate various paragraphs and still maintain the integrity of the books message."
1,"Same old story, different cover",You would think that this long after Sept. 11 that the information security community and it's wanna-be futurists and strategic thinkers (like Schnier) would at least be able to think in those terms. Originality of thought is nowhere to be found.
2,Eats batteries,I bought a Pentax Optio E30 a few months ago. After taking a few pictures (10-15) I had to replace the batteries. The new batteries lasted only 2-3 days and I only used the camera for less than an hour. I bought a charger and some rechargeable Ni-Mh batteries. They don't fare any better than the alkaline. I very seldom use this camera and the batteries go dead just sitting in the camera for 2 to 4 weeks. I would not recommend this camera to anyone I liked.
4,Rising Stars,"This is a solid project with multiple styles, something for everyone. If you really like contemporary gospel/R&B and great vocals, you'll LOVE ""Nothing's 2 Hard for God"" and ""Lover of My Soul"". If you're more of a traditionalist, ""Spirit of God"" & ""Give You Me"" will WOW you with the vocal arrangements. Overall, this album represents a spectrum of unknown talent that will have you movin' your head and raisin' your hands in worship."
1,This book is incomplete,I don't find the scales and arpeggios helpful enough. You can get better ones on the Internet and for free.The book does not give you the names of the notes on the fretboard. You have to figure that out yourself and it's not easy for beginners as you cannot see the subsequent tonic notes.Wouldn't recommend this book to my friends.
3,A big book on lots of small concepts.,I own this book and I found it to be cumbersome. I own a lot more book with less pages and more theory.
4,Very helpful,"I own most of the Guitar Grimoire books, but this one book covers a lot in a very practical way. The Grimoire's tend to be useful as a reference, but this Mel Bay book provides practical exercises that have really been improving my playing. I'm a beginner/intermediate player and appreciate that the book includes notation as well as tabs.This book has been a great companion so far. Highly recommended."
5,An ideal text for self-instruction,"Expertly compiled, organized, and presents by William Bay, ""Mel Bay's Complete Book of Guitar Chords, Scales And Arpeggios"" is a 298-page compendium of diagrams showing the aspiring guitar player how to produce just the right sounds from their instruments whether in practice or in performance. Each major and minor scale is presented in position on the guitar fingerboard with all scales being shown in diagram form, notation, and tablature. Of special not is the section on blues and rock scales. Thoroughly 'user friendly', ""Mel Bay's Complete Book of Guitar Chords, Scales And Arpeggios"" is provides an ideal text for self-instruction, and is very highly recommended as a curriculum supplement for mastering classic, rock, blues, and other forms of guitar music."
1,It broke after three month,It broke after three months. Does not light anymore. It started to flicker then stopped altogether.
4,Insighful Text,"I bought this book as a requirement for a college course at Indiana University and I truly enjoyed the authors ability to describe topics in a simplistic way, but without sacrificing the science behind it. It had many examples of experiments and scientific theories that helped me to better understand the process of memory development (mainly through rat experimentation). Overall the book was a good resource, and presented the information in a format that was easy to read and understand."
5,Papier Mache Magic,"This is a wonderful book. With clarity, terseness, and great pics, the author explains how to create papier mache objects from your own designs, using simple, recyclable cardboard and some glue! I've already created a picture frame for a drawing. She also explains how to decorate the items, e.g. stenciling, along with a clear explanation of the materials required and how to finish items. The only thing I wish she had included is recommendations for attaching hardware such as wall hanging hooks. Other than that I highly recommend this book for anyone wishing to be creative with papier mache."
3,"""Flights"" Has Trouble Soaring","Mr. Hynes does include detail in his book. He includes detail after detail. After detail. He includes so much detail that the reader is choking on it long before anything of significance happens.And then there are his observations. When finally he makes his first real bombing run, it is unsuccessful. He notes that ""I had missed the war, or it had missed me.""Say what?""Flights of Passage"" does not (to me) flow as a single work. It seems to move in fits and starts, going from one direction to another. It seems almost aimless.This book will give you some insights into what it was like to come of age as a young man in a lethal occupation during World War II. But you will have to work hard for the lessons."
1,Never worked,"Received my first one, followed the instructions, it never worked. Spent 45 minutes on the phone with Linksys tech support with no success. Returned the product to Amazon and got a replacement. Same thing: did not work, 45 minutes with tech support, no success. Returned to Amazon. To top it off, Amazon somehow ""did not receive"" (so they say) my return, so I'm out the $80 or so. Terrible product, I would not touch it."
1,Don't waste your time...,"After I returned the first WET54G I ordered, I did some internet searches on the constant reboot issue I was having. It seems this is a common problem. I'm returning the second device and getting my $84 back as it's just not worth my time to fight with it anymore. Save yourself time and a headache and buy something else."
1,The Worst Product Ever! - Never buy Linksys,This is absolutely the worst product I have ever purchased - it simply doesn't work - Linksys has replaceed it four times with products that are equally bad - I give up - throw it away - waste of money and a big waste of time. Do not buy Linksys!
1,Not Good,I am very disapointed in this companies performance. I am a soldier in Iraq and I spent almost 3 weeks waiting for the bridge to get to me witch is fine I know it takes a while for mail to get here. Once I did receive the item it never worked. Freash out of the package and it would not even turn on. I requested to return the product and was denied because I was not in the U.S.A. This is just not good customer service if you ask me.
1,Amazon is shipping an obsolete version of the WET54G,"Just received my WET54G and the hardware version is obsolete (v 1.1). The current version, according to Linksys, is version 3. This version is so obsolete you can't even upgrade the firmware. And it does not support WPA. Otherwise, it works great :-)"
1,defective and poor customer service,"I purchased this Linksys WET54 Bridge for my boat and it was defective out of the box. Linksys was a pain in the keester. I was on hold or referred to someone else for two hours until they finally determined that it was defective (typical made in China junk). They would not replace the item, and insisted their policy was to require me to pay the shipping for its return. I returned it to Amazon for a refund and Amazon paid for the shipping. I'll continue to do business with Amazon, but I've bought my last Linksys product."
1,54 means 20,"I'm returning my WET54g. 802.11g is kind of a scam - they claim it can do 54Mbps, but in reality the maximum you can do is 20Mbps; 14Mbps if you also have 802.11b devices on the same wireless network. The WET54g itself is an OK 802.11g device, but I had more connection flakiness with it than I expected. Mostly I was disappointed that 802.11g isn't nearly as fast as the advertising claims."
5,Easy set up and a very convenient bridge,"I wanted to connect my satellite box to the internet for load up DirecTv apps, but there was no feasible way of wiring it up to my router. So I bought this bridge instead and it works perfectly! It took about 30 minutes or so to set it up, but instructions are easy to follow. I know they provide live support but fortunately I didn't have the need for it."
3,Works well...after you get it setup,"First off, this works very well. We use it for an old iBook without an airport card, and with a PS2. I have a Linksys router and figured this would be an easy setup. Not quite, 4 hours later it was finally working, and I honestly don't know what I did to finally make it work. Haven't had any problems with it since then."
3,Is Amazon shipping WET54G hardware version 1 or version 2 ?,"It seems that version 2 fixed most bugs, as well as introduced WPA encryption (firmware downloadable from Linksys web site).Does anyone know whether recent Amazon orders are shipping V1 or V2? The 03 stars ratings are assuming V2.Thanks."
2,Power issues,"I have had 2 out of 5 of my WET54G bridges fail for no apparent reason. The power light just blinks on those, and the Linksys Support just says to send them in. I also had a Linksys BEFW11S4 start doing similar things. It is not my power's fault since they were all plugged in in 4 completely different locations/buildings when they failed. Linksys has some work to do to make these more stable/steady."
3,Works as described,"It seems to work fine. The only problem I was was connecting multiple devices to it. I connected it to a hub and then various devices to the hub.The only way for these devices to get access to the internet was to manually input the IP address of my DNS server. DHCP from my router did not seem to work across the bridge. But after I put in the DNS IP address, it worked fine."
1,Sandisk 4 gb memory stick pro duo,The stick stops working after 4 weeks. The camera can not see it any more. By the time I try to contact Amazon the warranty is over (30 days). Bad component...
2,Made my songs corrupted,"I brought this memory stick pro for my PSP. The videos played fine but any song I put on the memory stick became corrupted after about a minute or so. I didnt know the memory stick was the problem at first. So I ended up buying another usb cord which didnt help at all. I even reformatted the memory stick. still nothing. I then returned my new PSP thinking the problem was the PSP and not the stick. When I brought another psp it was still the same problem! songs were still corrupted. I am extremely disappointed in my purchase now that I know it was the memory stick all along.I gave it 2 stars instead of 1 because the videos worked fine, but that was it."
2,not satisfied,"advantage: i was amazed by the price for its too low for 4gb mem stick.disadvantage: no adapter.very very very very slow shipping, dont believe the estimated arrival of the item while you track your order. its like i bought it in December 2 and was shipped December 5 and the estimated arrival is Dec 8-11 but unfortunately it didn't arrive. i got it Dec 17. and they said that the item should arrive 7-9 business days and i understand that but they shouldn't put a estimated arrival date below 7-9 business days.a customer expect more in estimated arrival date...anyways, it arrives though. but im very disappointed."
3,Did not include adapter,The package did not include the memory stick adapter as stated in the product description at the time. I kept it since I did not have time to return it and buy another one some place else.I did not have any other issues with the memory stick.
5,amazing,you can buy two of these for the price of one sony memory stick...you'd have to be a retard to go with the sony memory stick.
5,"Short, succinct, smooth and sweet.","If this is the first project management book you grab you will be well served.The book meets its goal by delivering a concise, clear and down-to-earth description of project management fundamentals. The prose is lucid, the structure is laudable, and the points the author makes are honest and insightful. Further, Lewis' dry wit makes it a pleasure to read.The informal tone does not detract from the usefulness of the information (this is no ""X for Dummies"" shelf-crammer), and in fact the book covers quite a lot of ground.My only criticism is that Lewis limits his discussion of some items (for example team building) in order to sell copies of his other books and workshops. The irritation created by this marketing ploy would be soothed if Lewis could be prevailed upon to release a Collected Works of Worksmart edition."
1,not worth the trouble,I bought these for my piano light. The kids complained that the bulb was too bright and gave them headaches. As I was unscrewing the bulb it broke in my hand. I won't bother to return the other one because it isn't worth paying the shipping. Disappointing because this shape of bulbs are very hard to find.
4,ST 37 - 'Future Memories' (Four / Four Records),"Didn't realize at first but 'Future Memories' is actually a collection of ST 37 unreleased tracks and rarities. Thoroughly enjoyed their two Chrome-inspired cuts ""Sucking On The Family Tit"" and ""Egg People"" as well as their Motorhead cover ""Orgasmatron"" (sure sounds different from the original song) and the wailing ""Taboo Down Under"". Hear the Texas space rock collective's clear influences of krautrock, experimental, psych and punk within this disc's fifteen tracks. Also liked a couple of old radio broadcasts that ST 37 tagged on the nine-minute ""Should I Get My Own Friends... A Whole New Ball Game"" and the awesome eleven-minute ""Nature Of Smoke"". As I listened to this CD for the third time, I was a bit caught off guard that I didn't catch it before - their cover of the 1977 - David Bowie [from his vault] gem ""Speed Of Life"". Maybe not quite as astounding as 'Insect Hospital' (see my review) but awfully close."
4,Fantastic is the correct word,"I have used this product for several years and do not tire of the flavors and ease of preparation. I personally chop fresh parsley, mint, tomato and sweet onion, add a few fresh squeezed limes from my backyard tree, stir and refridgerate overnight. For the next few days, I feast on a beautiful, fluffy, ""clean"" tasting food that makes me happy and keeps me healthy.Thank you, Fantastic, for putting together this wonderful mix. I hope Amazon restocks it again. I have had to purchase it elsewhere because they didn't have it on several occasions. Perhaps it is just too popular. MMMMMMMMMM...."
4,Tabouli,Great product. You can mix it with any food or salad. Don't need to cook it. I will recommand it to all.
2,well alright,the button sticks out and apprently it easily turns itself on in my backpack becasue very quickly the battery died. Fine while it worked but I'm sad to have lost my old faithful one.
3,basic R commands but not R code examples,"If you are new to R and would like to know how to use R commands, get this book. However, if you already know R and would like to implement a huge code in R, this book might not be appropriate for you. Cheers!"
1,Beware of what you are buying,"This is not a reflection on the book itself, it is on the confusing information being presented. YOU MAY NOT BE BUYING THE FULL SIZE BOOK. I expected to get the full size 278 page book advertized. Instead I received a 109 page large print 2"" X 2"" miniature. The advertising on Amazon's page isn't very clear so be sure to ask the seller what you will get before you purchase."
1,Misleading,The book was described as Product Dimensions: 9.1 x 6.1 x 1.1 inchesShipping Weight: 1.4 pounds. The item that arrived is 2.75 x 3.25 x.5 inches. This was a very disappointing experience.
3,Words that sell,"Haven't really used it much, but plan to soon. I need to really get busy selling stuff on ebay. I've been really slack."
4,Well Worth it!,"Just to be clear, this is not a novel. It is a *detailed* account of the first circumnavigation of the globe. It is readable and presents first-hand impressions of the voyage's travelers. It is an interesting piece of history. For those that have travelled to other countries, this book will make you recall some of the first impressions that people have from other cultures.I wonder how people get interested about this book. For me, it was the nobel prize acceptance speech by Garcia Marquez in 1982 which included generous references to Pigafetta's story..."
4,A Must Read - but not a novell.,"First of all, You have to keep in mind that Pigafetta was not a writer. Hes was a noble from Italy, serving on the Diplomatic corps (if could call that in those days) that heard that Magellan was about to start a voyage never done before. The Pigafetta's drive was to see what kind of market was out there and how it would change the geopolitics established.Globalization. Today we use the web, blackberries and airplanes. In those days it was all about merchant ships, swords and cannon balls."
1,Egyptian Romany,"While there has been many historical presumptions that the Roma came from Egypt, The Roma came from India, that is what they say out of their own mouths. Which is rare since, Gypsies are private people, and don't talk much about this to outsiders. The term ""Gypsy"" is a misnomer made by European when they first arrived and it stuck, and will probably stay for good."
1,"Not very funny, not very entertaining","I bought this book on the strength of a review at amazon.com, and I'll never buy another book by this author. The book wasn't funny at all and in fact was insulting to anyone who has ever gone to any church of any denomination. I wonder if Avon would publish a book that said about Rabbis or Ayatollahs what this book said in the first ten pages? Pee-oo, What a stinker."
2,Poor Editing,The editing was very poor. You never knew what year they were talking about. It was disappointing. I was expecting more.
2,Rat's Tail at his best!,I LOVED this book! I think my designs are so much better now that I know when to open and close the windows at the right time! I was always so confused before. I can also make sure that I get good air flow by drawing those great ribbon arrows. This book is perfect for anyone who has never looked at the sky or felt the wind before or chooses to ignore their own senses! I think Brown could of done this without DeKay though. RULES-O-THUMB LUV!
5,The most beautiful ethnic jewelry book I have seen,This is a HUGE book filled with georgeous close-ups of really inspirational jewelry. A favorite of mine!
5,Swingin Fun,"I can't stop listening and singin to this CD - these guys are grea, wishthey would come and play in my town!"
4,Theologically accurate; Practically insightful; Fantastic for teaching; but Excessive in application,"The best resource I've found for spiritual gift study so far.The theological foundation is very sound, making good sense of the main passages on spiritual gifts in a way very few others do. Gifts are broken into 1) Manifestation (sign gifts - 1 Cor 12-14; Acts 2) 2) Ministry (equipping gifts - Eph 4) & 3) Motivational (every-Christian-gifts - Rom 12).Written in a style anyone can use.Inventories are great and surprisingly accurate for the limited number of questions used.Warnings regarding misuse of spiritual gift impulses are very helpful (e.g. a ""teaching"" gift can incline a person to feel they are always right).Application into the arena of employment is a bit excessive and beyond the scope of biblical applications for spiritual gifts. Better to do a Myers-Briggs or some other personality profile for that endeavor."
5,Tremendous Teaching Tool,This book has all that you need to encourage any Christian that he or she IS gifted by God. The author not only describes each gift as outlined in Romans ch 12 but gives biblical examples of each gift. A tremendous resource.
2,Sloppy writing but good message,"If I wasn't committed to a group study, I would have never made it through this book. It is awkward to read and has very cumbersome passages. The tests are helpful and the result is a more thoughtful and validating expression of our God-given gifts. There are better books out there on this subject."
3,Not for me...,"This book just wasn't for me. I can see it being usfull to others but, I personally didn't find it helpful."
5,Love it!!,"As it says in the book cover, it is complete, easy to understand.Each exercise has its explanation and photo.Love this book!"
1,Didnt work! Very Frustrated!,I researched this product before I bought it and found that it had great reviews. I was so excited and thought I had finally found something to help my 4 yr old daughter from slouching over on her booster chair sleeping and bobbing her head around. I am very upset and frustrated to find that it does not work. Her body still slouches over to the side just not forward so it only half helped. I wish I never bought it!!!!!!!!! Waste of money!! Does anyone have any suggestions to help.
1,Nasty,"I am sure this stuff works great, but I can't get it to go down. They grainy, gel-fluid makes me gag every time. I have tried a variety of flavors and they all have the same effect. Something about the consistency makes me ill. If you don't mind slurping down grainy gel-fluid then this stuff is good for you. Otherwise, stay away."
1,DO NOT BUY,"I bought this worthless product and followed the instructions to a t. A couple days after, the entire area I used it on broke out into tiny bumps and pimples. It's disgusting. I will NEVER buy anything from Nair again."
2,Burns skin and doesnt remove well,ive been useing this product for at least 2 years ~ im going to become a freshman soon so i want all my unwanted facial hair to go away faast ~ i notice that it leaves face hair thiK!!! and it looks super ugly on my skin. i noticed after i stop useing it and started waxing i had les mini pipples on my skin and i never break out so i freak out when i found those UGLY pipples on my face . i dont recommend this item its not as good as they say it isTHANKS FOR READING :)
3,Good reference material,"A few of the articles are stellar, but many are so-so. Nevertheless, it is very comprehensive covering topics from A to Z, so it is a good reference tool. Definitely for the HR professional, not the line manager."
5,Family Favorite,Parents were bored with Raffi and Barney. Purchased on a wimb and were pleasnatly surprised. We listen in several times a day and our 10 month old loves to bop to the beat.
3,Not as good as her others,"I have to agree with ""A music fan from Oklahoma"" in two ways:1) there's too much spoken, rap-like stuff for my taste;2) she's no Laurie Berkner -- she's better than Laurie Berkner: a better singer, a better composer, and a better lyricist. We tried Berkner, who is ok, but we were a bit disappointed.We have 3 Jessica Harper CDs. I would rate them in this order: It's A Wonderful Life (fantastic album for kids and adults), Nora's Room (very good), and Rythm In My Shoes (doesn't live up to the others; not nearly as fun, melodic, and varied)."
3,Strongly disagree with Jim Taylor,"This CD is certainly better than most of the kiddie stuff out there, but I have to disagree with what Jim Taylor said re. Laurie Berkner. I have never come close to finding anyone as magically talented as Laurie for young children. Weren't you listening to ""Victor Vito,"" ""Buzz Buzz,"" ""Bottlecaps"" .......the list is endless. Jessica Harper doesn't come close."
2,A Flimsy Antenna,"I bought this antenna to replace the one over 20 years old on my roof. My house is about 55 miles from Milwaukee, marked as blue zone on CEA website.The manual of the antenna is totally useless, The hardware doesn't match the list either. I had to figure out how to assembly it by looking at the picture on the box. Fortunately it is easy enough and took me less than 30 minutes to put things togather. The antenna is flimsy and huge, the parts would break or bend easily, I had to be very careful when moving or turning it.The reception of VHF is good, better than my old antenna equiped with a 26dB amplifier, channel 10 is almost perfect, while 4, 6 and 12 are good to very good. However, the UHF has not been improved at all.I also tried Chicago towers about 45 miles away (violet zone according to CEA), got simular results, good to very good VHF and poor UHF.I returned it to the store because I was worrying the parts could fall down in the wind and UHF was not good enough."
1,total garbage,Do NOT buy this!! I wasted 2 days getting it in my attic and it is just like the othewrs say useless!
3,Good,"The book started off great. He told of his early years and then to this years in the NFL. Then the book began to get boring. I love Randall. He was one of my favorite quarterbacks, but he could have left this book alone. He didn't have much to say around half way through the book. It was just football stuff."
