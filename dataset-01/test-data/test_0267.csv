4,Auschwitz,"Once I began reading and got into the story, I felt compelled to finish even if it was too sad to read at times. We must know what happened and we must not forget. I read Man's Search for Meaning many years ago and it was the same feeling."
4,"Without God, this will happen again!","Auschwitz is a grim reality work. It was written by a Patholigist who worked with Dr. Mengele at Auschwitz. He performed autopsies on both victims of German (homocides) victims as well as German soldiers when required. It is a powerful and hair raising story of survival. The Forward by Bruno Bettelheim of the University of Chicago in 1960, is very critical of the author Dr. Miklos Nyiszli from a moral perspective and I have great reservations of his views as only a survivor can know and understand what it takes to survive the death camps under Nazi control. This Forward is also gripping and worthy of reading closely. The plight of the Jew in Europe during the ten plus years of Hitler's regime defies human comprehenson. I pray this never happens again to any people but the human condition will always dictate otherwise.N.B. I read this book on my Amazon Kindle and I highly recommend it."
5,the more IMPORTANT and EXPLAINING book about nazis'cruelty,"I am an italian - JEW - doctor M.D.,I am born in 1932, Iescaped from nazis' persecution first hidden, after escaped inSwitzerland: I had a grandmother and two uncles died in Auschwitz and Mauthausen. I THINK as M.D. (and also psychanalist) systematically studying Nazism with a great interest - professional and personal and historical - THAT THIS NYISZLI'S BOOK IS THE MOST IMPORTANT AND EXPLAINING ABOUT THE ABSOLUTE PARTICULARITY OF NAZIS' QUALITY OF CRUELTY: NOTHING TO COMPARE WITH WHICHEVER OTHER SLAUGHTERS OF THE WHOLE HUMAN HISTORY. I was bewildered on reading another reviewer writing: ""interesting but nothing new"". I apologize but I don't agree at all."
3,A shocking first hand account of the atrocities of Auschwitz,"This first hand account of the atrocities of Auschwitz is deeply disturbing and shocking. While it is important that the world knows the injustice carried out by the Third Reich, this book is more like a document or a history lesson and fails to offer any insight into the author's emotions, thought or moral questioning of what he, and others were doing. The foreword by Bruno Bettelheim is extremely though provoking and I would love to read a book that discusses his question of ""why did millions of Jews march to their death with out any resistance?"". This would be an interesting discussion to hear from the both Jewish side, and perhaps from the side of those who have resisted and foughts against oppression and ethnic violence."
3,Informative,"Interesting story , thought it would be more detailed of the horrors that had happened at Auschwitz during these dark days."
5,Auschwitz,"Once I started reading this I could not put it down until the end!, having been to see a camp in Germany I could relate to the book. As horrible as this time was it is so very important for people to remember it."
3,Nothing new!,"Book was okay, at times almost boring. Nothing new that I had not read before. Would like to have learned more about life when author returned to his home town after he war."
3,Great book but was the Dr. really there?,"I found this book to be a great insight into the lives and deaths of Auschwitz prisoners. The Dr. gave alot of detailed description into the horrors of the Holocaust. However, the actual events that the Dr. described were not entirely accurate; according to other eye-witness accounts of Auschwitz. It is also troublesome to me that it cannot be proved that our Dr. was truly a prisoner in this death camp. My rating of this book is excellent in the sense the creation of awareness in the horrific events at death camps during the holocaust but after reading the book and doing some outside research I do not neccessarily believe that Dr. Miklos Nyiszli was ever detained in Auschwitz."
2,Dont' waste your money,"This book contains nothing of any value for the serious railroad developer. Virtually nothing on the economy, cargo or advanced play issues. Don't waste your money."
4,"Fast shipping, great book, some cover wear.","I'm extremely satisfied with this book. It was shipped within several days. Knowing it was used, I expected it to have highlighting all throughout the book, but it is only in the first chapter. Personally I think highlighting left in a book from the previous owner gives the next owner a little insight and studying tips! The cover has some wear, but I have taped it up with clear packing tape and it's perfect. Interplay is also a wonderful textbook and that material is very easy to understand."
3,A Word of Caution,"This item contains a substantially different group of tracks from Harpo's 1976 release, ""Moviestar."" Compare before purchasing."
3,Fast-Paced but Anticlimatic,"""Shoot out the lights"" gave a great description of a truly fascinating team. This is the tale of a great Knicks team that roamed the Garden floor in the days before the NBA was a multibillion dollar enterprise.The book works its way through the season, stopping to offer a few pages of biographical information on each player. The problem with this style is that it gets extremely repetitive and predictable. However, the information offered is excellent.The other problem I had with the book is that not enough time is spent on the great Finals series between the Lakers and the Knicks.The NBA does a better job than any other league of forgetting its past. The truth is, there were great players and interesting teams long before MJ came on the scene. This book will give the fans some insight into a few of those players and teams."
4,the face on the milk carton,"Not that many people pay attention to the missing children on the milk carton.But as Janie looks at the milk carton she recognized the girl on the carton, it was her 12 year ago in New Jersy at a shopping mall.Is it really true? Has Janie been kidnapped when she was three?Could her parrent kidnapped her?"
2,booooooring,This book seems like something everyone would like at first. But by the end it gets boring. And the whole time Janie is crying about her parents. It could have been a great book if more suspense was put in.
4,Face on the Milk Carton,This book is the best book I have ever read. If you like mysteries then you will like this one. I am trying to find the other books that go with this one. I would reccomend this book to anyone who likes mysteries. Please read this book you might like it.
4,A fantastic book!,"This book is a story about a girl who sees her picture on the back of a mlk carton. She tells her friends that it is her, but they don't believe her, who would? Now with the help of her boyfriend,Reeve, she must find out the truth about her kidnapping. It's a great book and I couldn't put it down!Also a little hint,have the sequels by you when you finish the first one! Believe me! If you like mystery then read the books The Face on the Milk Carton, Whatever Happened to Janie,The Voice on the Radio,and What Janie Found."
3,Face on the Milk Carton,"I can't imagine what it would be like to one day see a missing child picture on a milk carton and find out it's YOU! Filled with suspense and drama and what the Johnson's are going to do, the Face on the Milk Carton is a must read."
2,Not Recommended for Younger Readers,"Many people beleive The Face on the Milk Carton to be a wonderful book and a good one to have children read. I must disagree very strongly with this. There is mature content all throughout the book, and I find that about 40% of the story is about the main character's mystery and 60% is about her and her boyfriend and how it endourages their behavior. Definitely don't recommend this book for children in elementary school. Middle school girls would really enjoy the book, (I would know, I'm surrounded by them) but parents be warned at some of the content. It's a good idea for a mystery, but in my opinion the story was ruined by other things."
3,The face on a milk carton,"The face on a milk carton starts out about a girl named Janie. She had big red curly hair which she hates but everyone else adores. Janie has a pretty ordinary life, has loving parents goes to a good school and had good friends. One day at lunch shes eating and shes craves milk although shes allergic. As shes about to take a drink she notices a familiar face on the carton. She thinks its her, had she been kidnapped? Was she taken awaya and returned witout her knowing? Janie starts to panic she starts to question her so called ""parents"" but not getting any answers. Finaly she decides to get answers for herself. She goes into the attic and see the dress on the milk carton. She also finds papers that belong to Hannah. She gets up the nerves to ask about hannah. Janie was told about Hannah. One day her and her friend go out in search of Hannah. She comes back home but still confused. Janie might never know what happened, she may never find out."
3,To much romance,"The book the Face On The Milk Carton was ok. It had some parts that I did not like at all.It had too many romance scenes with janie and Reeve, the main characters. If the author didn't include it would probably be a great book. Also,in the end you have to read all the books that she wrote to get what happened. It's about a girl named janie that sees her self on the milk carton when she was little. She was kidnapped a long time ago. She's wondering did my mom and dad kidnap me, but she doesn't think that because her parents are so nice to her. She go's to new Jersey to find out who are her real parents but along the way her other parents don't even know there going there. did she find her real parents?"
5,The Face on the Milk Carton,"This book is a story of mystery, romance, and lies. It's a story about a girl who sees her face on a milk carton at school. She is very confused by all of this because she loves her parents and she cant believe that they would do something like that. She is also falling in love with her next door neighbor. She is very happy but her obsession and curiosity drives her insane enough for it to get in the way of her relationship. This is one of my favorite novels because it has enough excitement for everyone."
4,THE FACE ON THE MILK CARTON,"HI, ... I read your book "" The Face on the Milk Carton"". I have to say that is a pretty good book,I read it for a group project.The plot of the book is cool and also the charaters.I think Reeve is a very cool character because, he plays the role of the guy with alot of virility!!. Janie is so smitten over him because he has a car and he is cute (she thinks). I think I would want a car and all the cute girls chasing me in highschool! but, I would want a good brain on my shoulder ( which reeve does)."
3,ATTENTION BOOK READERS!,"If you like mystery books, than this is the book for YOU!!!!!! Well, its when a teenage girl gets a carton of milk. But she looks at the back of the milk carton to see a very familier face on the ""missing children"". It couldent be... but it is! It is her! Isn't that freaky? Well, I'm not going to say anymore because I might ruin it for you!"
3,The Face on the Milk Carton,"I read The Face on the Milk Carton, by Caroline B. Cooney. It is a realistic fiction novel. It is about a girl named Janie who one day sees a picture of herself on the back of a milk carton that says she is missing. She has loving parents, and cannot believe that they would kidnap her. She starts having memories of the past, with who she thinks might be her ""real family."" She also finds the dress from the picture on the milk carton, in her attic. She goes to her boyfriend Reeve, but does not have the heart to tell her parents. She had always wondered where any baby pictures were, and where her birth certificate was. Is this the reason? Does she really have another family? What will happen to Janie Johnson?I liked this book very much. It was suspenseful and kept you guessing what would happen. I think this book is best suited for people who like sadder stories, and people who like to guess what will happen next."
5,I love this book!,"This book is not that hard to get into, the first chapter was kindda boaring for me, but after that I thought it was one of the best books I have ever read. The plot is very interesting and it also has a little romance on the side. I hope you enjoy it as much as I did!"
2,I didn't like this book very much,Why? Because it was confusing. I couldn't tell if she was day dreaming or not. And I couldn't tell who was telling the story. But Caroline B. Cooney did a nice job desribing things in the book.
2,The Face on The milk carton- by Eric Hudgins,In this book a girl that is in her sophomore year of high school looks on the back of the milk carton and sees that she is the missing one on the back of the milk carton. Then she's trying to find out if her parents are her real parents or if they were fake parents. Then she finds out... uh oh I can't tell you that part.I recommend this book for one reason because it is very interesting. One reason I don't recommend it for little children is because it has some inappropriate things for little children. Another reason I recommend it is because it always has you predicting what will happen next. The last reason I recommend it is the finale encourages you to read the next book.
5,This is one of the best books I've ever read!,The book The Face On The Milk Carton is Great! I really liked the way the author told about Janie's life and how she found out about her family's secret. But make sure to read the sequals!
3,A disappointing book,"When I bought The Face On The Milk Carton, I thought it was going to be better. In fact, it reveals to be a very boring story with no real goal and non original characters."
4,What I think of the Face on the Milk Carton book,The Face on the Milk Carton was a great book. It was about a teenage girl who was eating lunch and saw her picture on a milk carton. At first she didn't want to believe it. But then all the clues came together and the truth came out. I liked this book so much because I love mysteries. Another reason is because it aroused my interest. I rate this book a definate four out of five stars. I recommend this book to people who like the same types of books the kind you just can't put down. This was a very intriguing book and I really enjoyed it. I would definitely read it again.
3,The face on the Milk Carton By Caroline B. Cooney,"""The Face on the Milk Carton"" By Carolin B. Cooney is a wonderful, suspensful story. Jaanie, the main character is an average 15-year-old, living an average life. One day while scanning over the back of the milk carton Janie see's litttle girl whom is missing. To Janie the girl looks vaguely filmiliar. She soon relizes that, that girl is her. The life Janie knew was now gone. Her parents, friends and life all became a story. This book keeps you on the edge of your seat the whole time. the only bad thing about this story is that you have to read the sequel, ""What Ever Happened to Janie"" - By Caroline B.Cooney to find out the ending. I highly reccomend this book to anyone who likes suspense."
3,So-So Book,"Hi my name is Shane Abbott, This book face on the milk carton is one of the few books I have Only liked a little bit. It is a good adventure but the mystery is ify. This book is about a girl named jannie spring who is in high-school, she has a boyfriend named revee springs also. This book also has a little bit of love in it.

I reccomend this book to 5-8th graders because it does have some challenging parts to understand!"
4,"A gripping, yet understandable book","THE FACE ON THE MILK CARTON, by Caroline B. Cooney.Wondering where her trust, past and family is, Janie Johnson(or is she really) carries the milk carton everywhere with her. You know, the one with the picture of her on it;the day she remembers so well. The collar of her dress itched her neck and her pigtails continually brushed against her cheeks. How can she remember so well when the faces in her day dreams didn't match those of the faces in her daily lives? The carton she has says she was kidnapped at the age of three. Her ""parents"" don't have pictures of her as a child. They ""lost"" her birth certificate. It's now all starting to fit together..."
3,the face on the milk carton,"This is a very good book. I would read it again if I had a chance to read it again.The book is about a girl named Janie Javerenson. One day she takes a drink of her friend's milk. She sees a picture of her self on the milk carton, when she was much younger.The whole book is about how she handles the memories that she didn't remember until she saw the picture of herself on the milk carton, and recognized the polka dot dress that she was wearing. ... I am wondering what happens to her and her real family. It was a great book."

5,Randolph Scott movie,This is a great movie if you love Randolph Scott as I do. The picture quality was excellent. Would highly recommend this movie to a friend.
5,Great for travel,"We travel with our 2 chihuahuas and we keep a pen in our van. It is great for visiting relatives and going to the beach. It keeps our dogs safe without always being on a leash. We have purchased 4 yards and have left them at different places we visit often. The pen is compact for storage and easy to set up. Reasonable price, fast shipping, and a better product than I expected."
5,Call For 4,Probably my favorite comics of all.You just gotta love the characters and all of the action.Enjoy
4,excellent replacement,We had misplaced the original cable that came with the camera. This works just as the original at connecting the camera to the computer. We are satisfied.
4,Pentax Camera USB Cable,"Recently , in the middle of a busy spurt , I had to get another computer & pictures would not upload . I first thought it was a software issue . something lost in the data transfer .I did want to check the cable tho , & after finding them on Amazon and for a great price , I decided to try it .The cable arrived quickly and pics were once again uploading . I guess it was Murphy's law that the old cable died the same time I had to switch computers but this replacement did the trick .In retrospect , I should have gotten 2 , so I would have a good spare on hand !The reason I give some things 4 stars instead of 5 is because I have not had the product long enough to know it's durability .I save 5 stars for something that has proven long term durability / staying power ."
2,American Horticultural Society Great Plant Guid (American Horticultural Society Practical Guides),"Not a real user friendly book. It's small size would be nice if you wanted to take it say as a dictionary with you to the nursery. Otherwise, save your money. There are many many more books on the market that would be a better buy for your money."
2,outdated,"I haven't read the book, so I'll be brief. The admissions information might still be relevant, but the changes made at the academy are significant. It is likely that what is written is so outdated that it has as much correct information as incorrect."
3,Classic arcade version,Does anyone know if this game has the unlockable arcade version like its console brother?
3,Book review for Oddballs,I thought that the book Oddballs was a pretty good book. some parts of the book were funny. One of the parts in the book that was funny was when they went on road trips they would play car games. When I read that part of the book it made me think about my family because when we go on road trips we play car games too. There were some things I didn't like. There were some parts in the book that didn't make sense and were pointless. Like when Vicky and her friends were dying their hair with grape juice. I would recommend this book to anyone who likes to read funny and unique books. If you read this book you will laugh untill your stomach hurts. This book was one of the first books I really enjoyed.
2,Oddballs,"This book wasn't as good as I expected it to be. Each chapter is a different story. So, there isn't one main conflict running through it. Yes, the characters were realistic, but that isn't what I look for while reading books. What I do look for is a good plot and a conflict that is solved with a reasonable conclusion. Some strengths in Oddballs were that it is, for the most part, well written. William Sleator does a good job letting us get to know the characters in each chapter, especially Bill, Vicky, Tycho, and Danny. And he makes the situations in the book sound funny when maybe they weren't as funny when it really happened. So, if you like books that are quick-reads and slightly funny, you would enjoy this book. But if you are like me and don't like that type of book, you should consider one of William Sleator's other books such as Beasties or Rewind."
3,an OK science fiction book,"William Sleator's Oddballs is a book that I could not put down at all. I thought that this book was an excellent book. If you are in a bad mood this book makes you laugh and fell much better. I thought this was the best science fiction book I have ever read, this being the only science fiction book I have ever read. Even though this was an excellent book I also did not likt it. One reason why I did not like the book was, because it was boring. I got so board that I almost fell asleep. I recomend this book to anyone who enjoys reading science fiction and about a really unusual family, that is kind of not ordinary . I hope you enjoy this book as much as I did!"
2,"Enjoyable, but not overly so.","After reading ""Life of Tom Horn"", the fictional account did not quite live up to expectations. Apparently freely borrowing for ""Life of Tom Horn"", ""I, Tom Horn"" was a disappointment."
4,Thanksp,Thank you for the book! Great condition. Fast and packaged well.Thank you very much. This thing wants me to write to Manu words. Lol I'm on an iPod.
4,Not a huge fan of American Lit.,"I'm not a huge fan of American literature. Aside from the short stories and occasional good poets here and there, I ignored it. Because I am going to be an English teacher, I have to acknowledge all forms of literature. This book is a wonderful collection (not as good as the sxth edition, which is thicker and has more in it) of some of America's greatest and newest authors. If you're into learning about American culture and the development of literature in the states over the last one hundred and fifty years, then this book is for you. Even if you're just a fan of Frost or Whitman, this book is still wonderful."
1,Missing Pages,"I recieved the book but it was missing pages 657-660, that was even apart of the story I need for class. I kept the book because I was already behind in my class, I could not loose another day."
3,Not Enough Suspense,"This book has an interested plot, but like lots of his books it lacks real suspense. Character development needs to be worked on too. Stephen King does a much better job getting into the reader's head. The good thing about Koontz's books are they have a surprising twist in them, that make them worth reading. After you read several of his books, the twist become predictable though. If you have a weak heart this book might not be for you. The killings are described in gruesome detail. This doesn't come close to Koontz's best, but is a good read. Just don't expect too much excitement."
4,Works on 97 Honda Accord SE,"Fixed the oil leak in the spark plug tube, a common issues on Accord, easy do it yourself, double check the torque specs on the valve cover, I was told 17lbs"
2,"Well, it's better than Afshar's travesty...","...Thought that isn't saying much. Bungarten demonstrates precisely no grasp of the music on this record, and turns a fantastic, and epic, work for guitar into yet another reason why the classical guitar is treated like the red-headed step-child of the classical world. Avoid."
5,An Excellent Guide for Choosing Friends,"In this book, Dr. Jan Yager carefully guides you through the many stages of friendship that are so necessary for a healthy and balanced life. She explains friendships of every sort, from the casual acquaintance to the coveted best friend for life. She also tells you how to cultivate and maintain these precious relationships but most important, how to avoid the pseudo friendship that could become toxic to your life. This book should be a basic in your library along with a good cookbook and an etiquette book."
2,"FLAWED, but mostly incomplete..","This guide isn't a guide at all. So many missing links. Thank God for Mick Martin & Marsha Porter for filling in the blanks, their ""DVD & VIDEO GUIDES"" are much better. It's rare that I don't find the films I'm looking for with Mick & Marsha. With this guide I only find something like 5 of 10 films. Mick Martin & Marsha Porter 9 of 10. Perhaps I'm just spoiled by them, because I see by the other reviews here that this guide was informative to some. Maybe its the only one they've read. One flaw example: Look at actress Winona Ryder's filmograghy, it has Tim Burton's Sleepy Hollow listed. Ryder is not in that film (not even in a cameo)."
1,what a piece of junk,"Add me to the list of people who think this thing stinks. I've got a 2.6 ghz dimension 4600 w/ 800 mhz fsb, 768 ram and a 120 gb hard drive...and this thing manages to crash my system every time. Oh yeah a top of the line ATI graphics card too...I don't know what the problem is, but the program freezes every time I start it up. It asks me to re-install the software each time I reboot the computer. Oh the CD it came with didn't even work either, it had junk stuck all over it and it wouldn't read. I downloaded the drivers and software but that didn't work either. It just keeps freezing.On top of this, the one time I actually got it to work (for 30 seconds or so), the picture was grainy and horrible, and there were popping noises coming from the speakers.From the gunk stuck on the CD I think they might have sold me a refurb or something...I'm about to call tech support and go nuts."
1,The card is a waste of money...,"Save your money, or buy a better tv card.It never works, I tried Windows ME, Windows 2k and Windows XP, and never works.I downloaded the ATI ""update"" and again it did not work (The update is very difficult to install)."
2,Pay the extra...,"I am no longer a fan of ""re-manufactured"" products. I recieved a jumble of three phones and a base unit heaped together and shrink wrapped then taped to a piece of cardboard. The instruction booklet had been poorly copied, stapled together and is missing 4 numbered pages. I expected a little more pride in product from Panasonic. The hand sets show wear and Ifelt the need to clean them simply for hygene purposes. I will be replacing them soon and it will not be with a Panasonic product!"
3,Enjoyable Brain-Candy,"I liked this book, especially I enjoy knowing someone else thinks that Molly Ringwald's dress in 'Pretty in Pink' looked like a trainwreck. Cabot is completely consistent in her style,so if you enjoyed the first few books of this series this one is a certain win. Obviously these books aren't for everyone, you have to have a certain amount of self-humour in order to connect with Mia and see the humour of the situations she is involved in.I'd also so these books aren't necessarily for some of the youngest readers as she does talk about 'getting to second base' quit a bit.It is good to see the effect Mia is having on those closest to her in this book, most noteably her Grandmere, and finally Lilly has to admit she was wrong about something!!"
3,A little forsed...,"Princess in Pink was a little off. It's an alright addition to the series, but very lacking in areas. Mia acts incredibley shallow, which was an unexpected and unwanted change for the normal character.Mia concentrates throughout the entire diary on one thing-The Prom. But it's not some ordinary prom-it's the Senior Prom. One problem-she can't get her boyfriend to go.When all hell breaks loose at the hotel hosting the prom, it goes on strike and closes down. Mia's grandmere is at fault( of course), but refuses to admit this, even though a replacement is acquired. Still, the problem endures, until Mia gets her boyfriend a gig at the prom."
4,Good stuff,So what do we got here? Well season 7 of the single best anime series ever made this one contains Great saiyaman & World tournament sagas wich in my opinion is the weakest link in the series(no super villans and no really epic battles although trunks vs goten and goku vs pikon is great).But you still get alot of the usual stuff thats in the other seasons jokes fun moments etc. In conclusion not the best season but still a must if you like me want the entire series on dvd box-set.
5,A Wonderful Series!!!,"This whole series has been one of the most enjoyable I have ever read! I coudn't put any of these books down! I found myself thinking about the characters when I wasn't reading, and then hurring home so I could read somemore. I love these books and can't wait for more!"
4,Thought Provoking,"As a college student who will be going into the corporate world after graduation, I really appreciated a lot of the points that Hyun made in her book. The discussion of balancing modesty and taking credit for projects, as well as just how to act in the industry, really opened my eyes. This book is not just for Asians, but for many people who want to understand the inner-workings within the business or in fact, any industry. I highly recommend this book!"
4,Very honest and practical - worthwhile to have a copy at your desk,"""As a Chinese-American management psychologist, after living and working in this country in the past 17 years, this seems to be the first practical book devoted to helping Asian American to succeed in the corporate world. Personally, I have felt that Jane knows my joys and challenges as a Chinese-American. Apart from some similar work in the past, Jane's analysis is quite penetrating, to the point, and often brutally honest. Her coaching advice is also succinct, direct, and practical, which we all can apply immediately at work to improve our mind set as well as our behaviors. Worthwhile to have a copy at your desk"""
5,Just started . Only the introduction .Will need time to learn this precious teaching,I am just the amature of learning about the meditation practice of Budda's teaching and trying to find the good books. It will be a while for me to finish the reviewing in a short time. This is to persue forever. I am trying to understand all the teaching. But I will say this is a very very high standard of teaching of the practice of meditation & to live the whole life.
1,Great game - pity about the book!,"Let me start by saying that I bought this book mostly for the equipment tables. Well, they are all wrong. Even the headings do not compare to those used in the game itself. There has also been equipment omitted from the tables. Also, the number of turns given for most of the scenarios in the campaigns are wrong. The strategies are mostly OK but if, like me, you are buying this book for the equipment tables - don't! Either the authors of the book did not play the game or there was a massive overhaul of the game after the book was written."
4,Almost perfect look at one of the world's finest.,"Chris Crutcher is The Man, let me tell you now.All of his works, even though they SAY fit in the young adult literature sections of libraries and bookstores, are really stories for everyone, young and old.Crutcher writes with wisdom and wit and words that make you feel wonder at the world.""Presenting Chris Crutcher"" attempts to go into depth, both into the author's life, and into his books. However, it does not allow a very deep look for the reader, and left this one desiring more. But then, I practically inhale every little detail I can about the books; nothing will ever sustain me for long.It's not perfect. But it's nice to know that CC is big enough to warrant being the subject of his own book."
4,Beautiful fragrance,The fragrance is my favorite; I would like it even more if it were longer lasting. The new version smells better than the previous one.
4,"Classic, but dated","Since it's a scent that was formulated in 1961, it's not a surprise that this smells dated. I imagine this is what one of the Gibb brothers would smell like.It's far from an unpleasant smell, to my nose. The opening is a bit too strong, but the middle is lots of cedar and dry grass.Few men can wear this these days, though. Sure, it's a classic smell, in that it's a example of the style of the 60's. Wearing this out today is just as bad as wearing vintage 60's clothing, and you will get just as many odd glances."
1,Very Disappointing,I bought this item with high hopes. The thought of being able to play from anywhere in a room was a nice idea. But upon playing DDR with this mat I experienced a loss of points in the game due to a slow reaction time with the game mat. I ahve been playing DDR for many many years. This is not a product I would recomend.
4,Pepcid Complete back on Shelves,It took me a while to find Pepcid Complete again. This was the only thing that helped me and I'm so happy to have it on the shelves again.
5,An excellent read.,"I have just finished the Neutronium AlchemistThe story just keeps getting bigger! A trulyawesome read, and very chilling."
5,A great story set in a vivid universe!,"I just finished reading this book, and I loved it. I love this entire series. The universe this series is set in is so real. I love it. I'm just sorry the storyline is being wrapped up in the next book. I just hope Hamilton doesn't give up on the universe he's so fleshed out in detail."
5,FUNNY!!,The Pigeon series books are hysterical. Any young child loves to read about the temper tantrums that they pigeon has over anything. My boys LOVE these books.
5,Another great book from Mo Willems,"This is the third book we bought in the ""Pigeon"" series. Our first purchase was ""Don't Let the Pigeon Drive the Bus"", followed by ""Don't Let the Pigeon Stay Up Late"". My son could read these two books 50 times a day and never get bored with them. Well, he was just as happy with ""The Pigeon Finds a Hot Dog"". For once, the Pigeon gets duped by a little duck and in the process learns a lesson about sharing--reluctantly. I also enjoy reading the Mo Willems books with my son, because there is a level of adult humor in his books that makes me laugh as much as my son does. Highly recommended for any home library collection."
5,HOT DOG THIS BOOK IS DE-LICIOUS!,"I was shopping today for my nephew's birthday. I already had picked out an armload of children's picture books when I spotted The Pigeon Finds A Hot Dog. Not only did I laugh hysterically out loud in the middle of the regularly quiet bookstore, but I was also very impressed with the story dialogue and the simple, but unique style of illustration. At any rate, I put all the other books back on the shelves, and rushed to the counter to purchase the book. Now, I'm debating going back and buying a few more copies, one for my collection and a couple more for some friends. I highly recommend adding this to your library."
5,here is what my first graders have to say about the book,"Yummy, Yummy, a hot dog. I like the part where he sees it's a hot dog. It is a funny book. The Pigeon Finds a Hot Dog by, Mo Willemsby, Alex age 6The Pigeon found a hot dog. He said, ""Yummy, Yummy, Yummy and then the little duck came. He said, ""is that a hot dog?"" This is a fantastic book by, Mo Willems. You should read this book. It reminds me when my brother dropped a hot dog and he ate it and he was grounded for a month and at home. You will like this book.by, Issac age 6"
4,vacuum cleaner,Recently purchased a Hoover self propelled vacuum cleaner and I am very happy with the service and with the product and would highly recommend the product and service.
4,Refurbs OK,"I purchased a Remanufactured Hoover U64019RM WindTunnel Self-Propelled Bagged Upright as I already own a similar model. With a few adjustments, it is as good as new and less than half the price of a new one. I don't like the bagless models as well, besides I have 10 dozen ""Y"" bags I ordered for the older unit and both use the same bag. Now I have one for upstairs and one for down. Both do an excellent job. I would recommend this unit to all my friends and relatives for this price."
5,Timely and timeless,"Archbishop Tutu writes with such power and persuasion that I am convinced his words will be around for many years to come, inspiring people as much in future generations as they do now. In this short book (which took just a couple sittings to read over the weekend) he lays out what I suppose is best described as his philosophy/spirituality of life. In this way it is timeless, but it is also quite timely in that I came away feeling compelled to take my own sense of spirituality and turn it into action in today's world. I often thought of my spiritual seeking as a solitary, inward-looking process, but through Archbishop Tutu I can now see that it must also, by necessity, look outward as well."
4,Great,"I have tried a few different ear phones of this kind but never got satisfied. This time I got! :) too bad only that the cable are so crappy, it should be soft and nice silicone cables to match the pieces, otherwise great product. Really good sound och I like the way you wear it. The add-ons are also nice, PTH works really good, on eg aeroplane."
5,Takes Your Breath Away,"Prior to owning these earphone, I owned the Shure EC3's and I thought they were fabulous. I upgraded my music player so I decided to upgrade my earphones also.I have to tell you, the sound is absolutely breathtaking. They are comfortable to wear & just a joy to own.If the sound of your music is important to you, give these earphones a listen, you won't be disappointed."
1,"Cliché, cliché, cliché","Not necessarily obvious to the outside viewer, but Doctor Who was in trouble at the end of the era of Patrick Troughton, the second actor to play the Doctor on TV. Several scripts fell through, and I can only hope that this one was made out of sheer desperation.Terrance Dicks adapts this low-grade space opera, which is really a Western dressed up in a space suit. The TARDIS arrives on a space station, and the Doctor, Jamie and Zoe are separated from their ship when the station is split apart. Inevitably they get caught up in this trivial tale of claim jumping and political struggle for the control of a mining company.Read it if you are a completist. Avoid it otherwise."
4,Great read on catholic church and exorcism,"Read this book in my twenties when it first came out. Liked how it went into detail on the steps taken by the catholic church to approve an exorcism. Of course, after watching "" The Exorcist "", I wanted to read the non-fictional account of what the movie was based on. At times, I got a little paranoid at my surroundings while reading certain sections of the book! Bought a copy for my niece to read as she enjoys a good scare as much as I do."
2,possessed???,"Begin reading this novel; it starts off okay, but too much narration, is involved in the story itself, which takes away the feae & realistic (thoughts/feelings) that should be present in a supernatural-horror-story; thus far, this novel is nothing compared to the exorcist...even the book is/can be a little scary, fear-intimidating. if you are telling a true story based on records, do not overshadow the storey with interruptions of reasons/why/how things went on so long. if given the chance, i would not waste money on this book."
4,A story that is the essence of immigrant & American life.,"Bread Givers is a simply written story, but it captures in depth what is was to be an immigrant in the early 1900's. Sara was an example to us all to be our own person and live our own lives. Sara displayed Yezierska's idea that it is not possible for am immigrant to become one hundred percent American. It would be immpossible to completely wipe out one's past. Different backgrounds are what make the United States such a unique country. Immigrants coming to the United States should not be forced to forget or abolish their own heritage, but they should adjust to the new life that they have gained, just as Sara Smolinsky did willingly, and her father, Reb Smolinsky, was forced to do in the end."
4,having fun,"Great game. Only problem we had was that one of the wireless connectors doesn't seem to work properly, so we need to get it replaced, but when it works, and when we use the other one, we have a great time. It's really hard! and tons of fun! Can't wait for a newer version with more songs!"
4,FIRST OFFENCE.............NOT!,"First Offence is the first album recorded by Corey Hart. He had been writing songs however since he was 13 years old. Some of these have been used on the album.He sings about the high school dance on ""At the Dance"",even though he recorded this album at 22 years old.Still its good to hear his early writings. First Offence blends pop with a rock edge. Highlights are Peruvian Lady,Lamp at midnite,Shes got the radio and the hit single Sunglasses At Night which is an extended version.This album is very enjoyable bubblegum pop but not his best work.That came later!"
4,"MORE COMPELLING LIVE, BUT HAVE TO LOVE HIM","Grown Backwards seems a summation of Byrne's twenty years of maturation since Talking Heads. His new lyrics still offer cracked imagery, but a perceptible framework of thought now makes itself more easily noticed; current events, from the deeply personal to the global, can be discerned, rustling about in the undergrowth on the outskirts of perception. Especially with the Tosca Strings, a string sextet, so prominently featured, Byrne's pop arrangements are often scored with a minimalist sensibility that imparts a spirit of downtown seriousness to them. Byrne is in often exceptional voice on the recording, a description of his singing that would have been unlikely back in the day. Not only has his arsenal of personae gained convincing depth; his duet with Rufus Wainwright on a Bizet opera aria is both idiosyncratic and breathtaking."
1,Cataract med,This product does not work to eliminate cataracts.. If u have a punctuate or dry eye it may help but full blown cataracts no...
5,Perfect hearsay book by an amazing law professor.,Used this book in class with the actual professor along with the actual hearsay rulebook. Barely had to look at the rule book. Perfect supplement to the rulebook with clear and concise foundational elements that make preparing for exams easy.
5,I highly recommend,"This book was so easy to follow. It was broken down into elements, which made the rules ""workable"". The book was filled with great and memorable examples which helped tremendously when memorizing the foundational elements."
1,This book is as bad as the Dean Milk/McCullough decisions,"This book is garbage. The problems with this book are these. Or, at least this:1. The pictures on the cover are ridiculous.3. The means of this book do not support a legitimate end.D. George Bush would never allow this rubbish into Texas.F. (subsection 3)- the hearsay rule isn't real.Thomas, Roberts, Alito, Kennedy, and I should overturn Dean Milk and McCullough, and in dicta, they will do this: banish this book off the face of the earth."
3,Deadly Design,"This first in the new series features interior designer Erin Gilbert who finds herself in the middle of a murder investigation while participating in a design competition with her business rival, Steve Sullivan. The mystery reminds me of the classic 'locked room' mystery with a small group of interconnected suspects. There were lots of design tidbits throughout the story, and while some of the descriptions were a bit long for me (I am interested in design, but only up to a point), they added a unique dimension to the book. The main character is interesting and easy to care about. I'll seek out the next in the series."
2,Optilux LEAK,In talled the lighting system and drove around with them and after the first rain storm I found one of the lights fogging up. The seal did not last even one rainy drive. I was expecting the lighting system to do much better than advertised! I did not have the time to remove the a fending light and have chosen to live with something that is going to fail!
2,I see the light....for only the 1st week,Great out-put of light...but only lasted for a week. One of the light keeps going out...just trouble some...not that easy to install either. Directions confusing and just cheap. I don't even turn them on any more.
2,2 Stars instead of 1 Simply Because I Couldn't Stop Laughing,"My husband & I rented this movie because we love the horror genre & thought we might be in for a good scare. No such luck in that department. We did laugh a lot, though. We actually made a joke of reccommending this DVD to our friends just so we wouldn't be the only one's who wasted our money. The plotlines were mostly terrible. The story about the boy who cuts off his finger is the worst piece of crap I've ever seen. That one wasn't even funny. Seriously, though, go rent it anyway if you want to laugh. Oh, and sidenote, Rob Zombie should be ashamed for promoting this. Bad Rob!"
4,Original,"This is a compilation of 7 short horror movies. they are all pretty good and would not be surprised if they were made into feature length films. my personal favorites were disturbances, inside, and the hitch. like another reviewer said scenes stay with you after you have shut off the dvd."
1,Lasted less than 8 mos,"Item is attractive and worked well for about 7.5 months. Then it totally stopped working. Replaced batteries, not the problem. Scale now shows random numbers and then goes black whenever you try to use it. Totally worthless. It's still under warranty, but Taylor requires you to pay shipping both ways, which is more than the $50 I spend on the scale originally. Even with shipping, they will only repair, not replace the scale. Item is made in China, as was every consumer item that has broken prematurely on me in the past year. I will now look for a scale that suits my needs that was made in a country with some better quality control."
4,Just fine,"I'm not sure how anyone makes distinctions among the very many models of bathroom scales. I bought this because my old scale was about three pounds off and i was working on a serious diet so why not buy a better scale? I didn't want the claimed ""bells and whistles"" of BMI calculators and other features which I just saw as things to potentially fail, involving calculations easily performed by other means, and adding quite a bit to the price. I wanted something simple in design, that read reliably and easily with large backlit digits. This scale more than meets those requirements."
2,Great while it lasted...,This was an excellent all around scale until it stopped working after just under a year of use in our bathroom which is used by myself and two roommates.
1,Based on VERY OLD research,"Ideas on Byzantine clothing have altered dramatically since this text was written. If you are looking to create an authentic type of garment for yourself, stay away from this book."
1,Hold on for a headache,"This has got to be the worst book I've ever read. She rambled on and on. It was as if she just sat down and thought ""right, I'll just confuse the hell out of people by writing down random things that don't connect or make sense"" Not one of her best to say the least"
5,Face-Time is a very entertaining book.,"This is one of the most entertaining books that I've read in some time. Also,the timing is right in that everyone's interest has been peeked by the Presidency. The author's vocabulary is not your common every day garden vocabulary with which readers are more comfortable, but it's the author's first book!"
4,Tarloff relates to men and their emotions,"First of all I enjoyed this novel a great deal and was presently supprised how the author kept triggering little stabs at my emotions. I kept forgetting that this was fiction and not a true story .. a fine tribute to the Author.Secondly, I started not to buy this book as I had read most of the political non-fiction books relating to current sex events in Washington to which I have become bored. This was a fun and easy read, a pleasant break from the mainstream.I highly recommend this novel for other men, but be carefull because the Author has done such a good job you will start to see yourself in the characters. I believe that you will think like me.. maybe Erik Tarloff has lived this experience."
2,Neither black nor white nor much fun,"This sure sounded good. Joe Klein made an excellent novel out of similar material. Tarloff begins with an interesting premise and keeps his characters in the intriguing gray area of believable human behavior, their hats neither clearly white nor black.So why is the novel not much fun, and eventually interminable, despite its brief length? Perhaps because it doesn't read like a novel, but rather like a prose outline for one: we are told everything, shown little. In theory, the story presented is interesting, but theory is all we get, and eventually it all gets kind of whiny and annoying. And although the book remains well-balanced, it almost never, ever funny.Without humor, or anything resembling a satiric edge, we're left with an earnest sexual/political soap opera in which not much happens. This book feels as if it contains a good story struggling to break free, but it never quite manages to do so."
4,Keep an eye out for these guys....,"I found Deepsky on the internet and heard some of their stuff. I was pretty impressed as Stargazer is extremely catchy. Track 2 ""Cosmic Dancer"" is also pretty good with its worldy sound. This Cd is definately worth it and will stay in your tray for a while. Look for their Phuture 2000 remix!"
1,Avoid this game.,"The battle time is just too slow. I rented it and returned it the same day even though I had a week longer to keep it. I was attracted to it only as a novelty because I was an extreme fan of the cartoon series as a child; I didn't have high standards/expectations for it, but the game was just not fun at all. I was playing multiplayer with my boyfriend and we just couldn't stand it. We beat the first boss and then were too bored to go any further. It is too slow. Perhaps someone younger would enjoy it; I don't know if it's so slow because it was geared towards children or not, but I definitely would not recommend it to teenagers, adults or anyone serious about gaming.I put 5 stars for how durable the toy is because it was required to answer, but I wouldn't know because I only rented it."
2,No more turtle games please.,"I have to say that the graphics were better than the first Battle Nexus and the four player co-op was a good idea,but the controls are terrible and camera angles could've been better."
5,love it!,"I've had so much fun with this as a start-up when I want to write and am uncertain of the topic or am a little stuck. The room on each page for notes or writing is helpful too, making this the only book I need to tote with me if I want to use it."
5,Hard to Find but worth it.,This book was one of Cunningham's sources for his famous inscense and oils...A definite must have for any apothecary.....
2,Not what I was looking for,"Unfortunately, Not the book I was looking for. Though not what I need there are some things that are insightful."
1,Loud and cheap,I have owned several G scale trains. We have run one constantly in my store for the kids. This is by far the squeakiest train I have had. The squealing is constant even in the long flat straight aways. Not worth the cheap price.
5,Great album!,This album is great! From the excellent rock songs to the superb love songs. It's a definite must for any Elvis fan!
1,The Beginnng of The End,"This album was a monster success. So much so, that it convinced Col. Tom Parker that movies and soundtracks was the way to make money. No more recording sessions for real albums, just silly crap from the movies, with only an occasional excellent song thrown in the mix. It would stay this way for nearly 7 years, till the all too brief resurrection of Elvis as a recording artist 68-72. Prior to this release, Elvis was still recording mostly EP's for movies, and had excellent real albums like ""Pot Luck"" and ""Something for Everybody"". After Blue Hawaii, it would be 7 years of crap. Wish he'd never made this record. Forget this mess and get one of the hundreds of ""greatest hits"" packages that includes ""Can't Help Falling"", unless you just gotta have ""Ito Eats""..."
1,Blue Hawaii,"Very unhappy for the purchase of CDs because both came in damages cases. They were not well prepared for mailing. I couln't give them as a gift, which was the main purpose for this purchase.Unhappy client:("
3,Hawaiian cd,Purchased for our Laua party and it was not really the type of music I expected.I am sure it is decent for a real Elvis Fanatic.
5,Perfect Elvis Gift...,We purchased Elvis' Blue Hawaii as a gift for a relative who loves Elvis. They appear to love it thus far.
3,Useless unless you modify it,"The top (screen) portion of the Motorola V3 has buttons on the sides. This case tries to cover up the entire top, including the buttons, which it depresses when you try to slide the top half of the V3 in. So this case is apparently designed for another phone. However ... you can take a pair of scissors and cut the clear plastic about halfway up, and then this becomes a reasonable case. I was worried that the cut plastic would continue splitting where I cut it, but after 6 months it's still holding. Oh yes and when you dial the phone number that they list on a little tag in the case, you get a recording ""connect now with exciting local ladies."""
4,Better than the earlier albums!,"I've always been a moderate fan of Spacehog, and I own all three albums. Although each album has it's plusses, my own personal opinion is that this album surpasses the others. I find myself listening to it more than the other two (and not just because it's newer). Songs like ""Jupiter's Moon"" and ""I Want to Live"" make the CD definitely worth a spin!"
2,cheaply made,"My son wanted a fire truck to build and this was the only one I could find. While we were putting it together, some of the pieces broke before we could put it together. We used super glue several times to finally get the truck together. Now it is together but there is no way he could play with it without pieces falling off. Very cheap materials."
4,A Gibbons extravaganza... a rock guitar benchmark,"Once the first few seconds of this CD make it to your eardrum, you'll realize that Billy Gibbons has captured the coolest, nastiest, yet smoothest guitar sound around. This CD is the high water mark for The Rev. Wille G. Jaw dropping originality, tone and playng ..so why only 4 stars? The achellies heel of ZZ Top ...gennerally stupid lyrics."
5,Great Guide for Spring Training in FL!,"We've been going to Florida for spring training for most of the past 25 years. We bought Byrd's guide at the first 2005 spring training game we went to. The reviews of the spring training sites, shade/sun available, autograph opportunities, and food served at the games are right on! We have several other guides, but this one is the best! We used this one for the entire week we were in Florida."
1,Recieved product broken,"HO Laptop was recieved with severely cracked screen which was claimed to be directly from the factory box, seller (""Express Solutions"") is very slow in trying to deal with the situation and responding to e-mails, and is very unresponsive and unaccomadating to the fact that the screen arrived broken."
3,Good,These served their purpose not much to expect. they did what they were suppose to do make the cake pretty.
3,Good Starting Point,"Wilton's 12 Piece Cupcake Decorating Set is a great starting point for people who want to decorate cakes or cupcakes. I come with Star tips 1M and 22, round tip 12 and bismarck tip 230. I used the bismarck tip 230 to fill cupcakes with filling and the 1M for decorating. However, this kit does not come with couplers. So you might want to purchase those as well. It's fine if you don't have them, especially if you are starting out, but if you want to be adventurous then try them out."
3,Good buy for someone only interested in select statements,"This book should have been titled Oracle8i SQL Exam Guide. All author covers is simple select statements, joins, pre-defined sql functions, some basic tuning concepts with poor examples. As a matter of fact author covers pl/sql in less than 50 pages..... Not a good buy for intermediate/experts or someone planning on taking OCP DBA pl/sql Exam. Starter's might find this book useful. I recommend Oracle8 DBA certification exam guide."
2,very disappointing,"I bought this book because I'm venturing more deeply into interior photography after many years of portraiture and architectural/travel work. This ""updated and expaned"" edition has simply tacked on a couple of cursory chapters on digital photography to a tired and outdated manuscript that needs reworking from top to bottom. You won't learn much here, with a lot of topics, almost all covered inadequately. The author appears to know whats he's doing (judging from the sample photos) but he's revealing very few secrets. I've learned a lot more through trial and error. If you're interested in interior lighting, for example, consider John Freeman's Lighting for Interiors. It's dramatically more useful."
2,Ninja Turtles for Super nintendo is better than this!,Ninja Turtles Battle Nexsus sucks! The game sucks. Your moves suck and don't have anything to do with ninja turtles. Last time I checked Mikey couldn't throw a fireball. This is the worst game since Spyro Enter the dragonfly. Save your money and buy Kingdom Hearts. Kingdom Hearts rocks. Ninjs turtles 2 sucks.ITS SIMPLE.
5,music for music lover,nothing to really write outside of what has already been written. The CD came packaged and works in my CD player.it's just.awesome.:)
5,The Greatest Album of All Time.,"The intensity of the pleasure you feel as the songs reach their crescendo's is so unreal, it's rediculous. I used to be a fairly typical young man before I first heard this album. Now I have decided to be celibate for the rest of my life, because I do not need anything other than this CD. It completes me.Every song on this album is spiritually transcendent. I've played this album to all my friends and family, and all of them were moved to a state of excessive emotion which they did not come out of for days. The word genius is an insult to David Hasselhoff, as there was nothing like this kind of music before his emergence. He is a true visionary. Some people are scared by his brilliance and so pretend to hate his music. These people are denying themselves of the greatest feeling ever known to man.Peace and Love."
5,"Oh baby, this is by far the best","I am in a music class (Music and Feelings or Music and Mind or something like that) and so I know good music when I hear it. I borrowed this CD from my favorite (and you know what I mean by favorite!) freshman boy Joseph P. Park and as I listened I was lifted to another place. Some might call it heaven, if your idea of heaven includes the cries of a Neanderthal accidentally stabbing himself with a piece of flint while trying to make a fire. The raw, shameless, reckless abandon of David Humpalot's music has given me new inspiration--inspiration in a world of music where I had only previously encountered talent and skill."
5,A nugget of pure aural nugat...,"Ah David Hussendorf... If you've never heard any of his albums, you are missing one of the great experiences that life can offer you. Actually you are missing out on something that is so indescribable that almost 1000 people have tried to put into words the emotions that come welling to the surface when listening to Dustin's astonishingly fabulous album 'Looking For-Best of David Hasselhoff [IMPORT]'. Since first laying ears on this mystical/magical piece of staggering musical genius, it has never left my CD player. I have it in my clock radio as well so it's the first thing i hear every morning, and the last thing I hear at night, such is the grip it exacts on my psyche. It can only be described as... it is too much for me... it cannot be described... you simply MUST experience it for yourself.The song 'Hot Shot City' is particularly good!"
5,Where are the words?,"There is no point in even TRYING to find the words to express the sonic nuances and subtleties that lie hidden within the bowels of this fine work. I tried the Oxford English Dictionary and dictionary.com -- no good. The words simply weren't there. I spent many sleepless nights reaching back through the entire works of Shakespeare (including all the sonnets) and didn't even find a SINGLE WORD worthy enough to describe this masterpiece. How can you employ something as lowly as language to convey the emotions aroused by this celestial work?I believe that God has blessed Hassselhofff with many fine things. Lush hair, a winning smile, a talking car. But nothing, NOTHING is as important as the gift of divine melodic construction that the Lord saw fit to bestow on this fine auteur's shoulders.Out of all the tracks on this meisterwork, I would highly recommend the song ""Hot Shot City"", as it is particularly good."
1,Looking For-Best of David Hasselhoff [IMPORT],"Greetings Earthlings....and goodbye.I, Groth, commander of the Venusian Deep Space Science Fleet, and 10,000 of my colleagues were en route to your planet to impart to you all the secrets of the universe (engine blueprints for interstellar and time travel devices, the name of God, the whereabouts of Jimmy Hoffa, Lord Lucan, etc) and to offer an invitation to join the Intergalactic League of Clever, Hip Planets.However, our listening antennae picked up The Best of David Hasselhoff being played frequently...too frequently... on your world. You are obviously not ready for the great knowledge that was to be yours. We have turned away and will visit other planets instead.See you in 100,000 years."
1,wtf...,"Is this a joke..? A cruel joke..? Apparently not... Why would someone buy this...? Its a horrible piece of garbage! I would rather eat my out skin off than buy this. If you thought Knight Rider was bad, you'll just loooove this! I wouldn't reccomend anyone to touch or look at this is it was in an airtight box 1000 miles away!"
5,The Best [IMPORT],"Like an absent-minded man who almost went to a party dressed only in his underwear said; ""I nearly came in my pants"" (In England, pants are underwear. Americans can substitue whatever term they use.)This one CD will make your life complete - don't take my word for it - buy a copy today.Hot Shot City is dark brown and steaming."
5,Truly King of the Internet,"David Hasslehuff is the most fantastic musician in this world. Truly there never was a better german singer. I really love his song ""Hot Shot City"" it is particularly good. I always get that feeling in my stomach like butterflies when you fall in love or like eating german chocolate when I listen. The Huff rules!! Ich liebe Huff!"
5,he is 'my rock',"Is it just me or does listening to this smorgasboard of musical viagra take you back to that fateful day in 97'? yes i am talking of course about the death of our beloved, Diana, Princess of Wales. Like Diana, Davina Hassletassle & her spindly legs have somehow come to capture the zeitgeist of the world we know, with all it's hopes, dreams, fears & desires, perfectly encapsulated in the dull horror & 80's synth wizardy on show on this, Deidre Hassbeenofthetellyawhiles' 'magnum opus'. I cannot in good concience sign off without of course mentioning 'The Voice', once described as 'A pack of Ferrets sexually abusing a row of metal dustbins', with Frank gone maybe Des're Hasselhuffingtons time as global crooner in chief has finally arrived? like Diana, Davids' music will be with us forever (in our hearts & bargain bins coast to coast)truly a legacy to be proud of.needless to say the song 'Hot Shot City' is particularly good!"
5,Hot Shot City,This is a great album as most reviewers seem to agree. There's been quite some hours spent contemplating this musical feast and most aspects of the album have been covered...The only thing left to add is that the track 'Hot Shot City' is particularly good.
5,5 Stars - wish I could give it more!,"I love my job at the abattoir, but listening to David allday just makes it THE best job in the world! I particularly like listening to track six on repeat.I've even got the Working Mens Club to play it on a Friday/Saturday evening. Pure Class!Well done David!"
5,All Off for Hasselhoff!!,"It's hard not to overestimate the importance of ""Best of David Hasselhoff,"" the album that firmly established Hasselhoff as an unparalleled songwriter, wheezing his odes to young gay love and teen suicide. After this release, German Beer Chugging Ballads became quite popular on college campus and bohemian circles, making Hasseloff a beatnik superstar on the underground FM radio charts of the late '60s. ""Best of"" also revealed a singer who belts out goofy, pained excretions that capture the sound and spirit of America as much as that of Black Flag or Foot. The song ""Hot Shot City"" is particularly good."
5,The CD so good it made me collapse on the floor and orgasm six times,"I was a depressed, angsty and lonely teenager until a week ago. And then, as I was walking to school, God appeared in front of me. I begged him for a cure to my woes.And He answered ""Salvation can only be found in the One, the only One who is higher than me. I created the universe, but this higher power created me.""Trembling I asked, ""But... who?""God smiled fondly, ""Your race call Him 'The Hoff'"".And so I ran back home, purchased the CD from Amazon and revelled in holy bliss. The rest, as they say, is Hasselhoff.The track 'Hot Shot City' is so particularly good it hurts."
5,Who cares if this title isn't available?,"I mean, there's gotta be some copies of it SOMEWHERE; it's just a matter of finding whoever's hoarding them all and robbing them. This CD is SO good, it is worth getting it by any means necessary. Even if it means using 'extreme measures.'To listen to these 18 songs of pure, magical bliss is an experience so mindblowing and ecstatic that it is worth knocking your grandma over to turn up the volume. The musical arrangements and production are so revolutionary, it is not beyond good taste to punt your Dad in the jewels in order to listen to these tracks over and over. And to get swept away in David Hasserchief's voice- a voice that some claim sounds like a gazelle spanking two donkeys- is an experience so orgiastic and fanastical that it warrants torching a hospice. Yes, it's THAT GOOD.The particularly good song ""Hot Shot City"" is about Hell, which is where I'm heading."
5,One true soulshaka!,"Nothing can compare to the rich musical tapestries that David Humuspoole weaves with his microphone. Glittering, shimmering cords of golden song stretch forth from his cleft chin and tickle the eardrum. The silence between each track on the CD is unbearable, because you are aching to be immersed in the perfection of his voice every moment. And once his singing shines through again, you are drenched in the magnificence of Hasselchoff's unique voice, a voice that recalls the sounds a furious rhino makes as it falls down a long flight of steps.Has anyone heard the song ""Hot Shot City?"" Any opinions?"
5,"A great album, no joke!","I actually enjoy this CD! Listen to ""Freedom For the World."" for instance. If there ever was a time to listen to this inspirational song, in these dreadful days of political problems, that moment would be now. Same thing goes for ""Save the World"" and ""Looking For Freedom."" All of these songs are inspirational to me! And the other more fun songs are a real hoot, too. You could imagine songs like ""Do the Limo Dance"" or ""Is Everybody Happy"" on X-103, our radio station. The song ""Hot Shot City"" is particularly good."
5,Five star stud,"When it comes to this album, there's no need to get dressed in body paint and say ""Sock it to me,"" because this album socks it to me without the body paint and me saying ""Sock it to me!""But redundant Rowan and Martin references aside, this reader urges you to just sample the wondrous musical world of David Hobbitcock. You will thrill to every angelic note that pours forth from his god-like mouth. As if from a cleft-chinned gravy boat, the songs he sings drench a melody with the thick, viscous sauce of his talent. Eardrums quiver in ecstasy as he honks and wheezes his way through 18 chart-topping hits. I am comfortable in my sexuality to declare that David Hamsterdance is truly a centaur of the pop world. He can ring my dingy anyday!The song ""Hot Shot City"" is particularly good."
5,His Cup Doth Overflow,"As the evening of my life draws to a close and God pulls the curtains of my existance; as the galvanised bucket of my mind is kicked from beneath the pedestal I stand upon, as the air I am so used to feeling lays languid in the atmosphere above my mouth and the princess of the chocolate night steals my final dream from me. As I follow the light in the top-right-hand corner of my room to allow the silver string of my soul be released from this mortal coil, I will cry. For I know, when the end comes, my ears will bleed for the death of the aural pleasure I have suffused with my everyness and being. Such glory has been rendered to mine eyes by the visions brought to me by listening, just listening, to this music. Music seems to small a word; this Cocophany of Wonderousness. Yes. That's better.When I die i pray that THIS will be the music they play in heaven. I beleive that God, in his wisom, feels that track six, Hot Shot City is particularly good.I concur."
4,Very good - but in a must from Brotzmann,"What makes this recording so good is above all the interplay between those musicians. They really know how to communicate together and they are full of ideas. This is a very emotional for Brotzmann, because he really felt he has strong link to Ayler as he expresses it in the liner notes"
1,This product can not be seen in DVD Players from Zone 1 (USA),"I bought this product but I had to return it because of its specification. It seems this DVD is for Zone 2 (Europe) because I could not use it in my DVD Player which was bought here in the US. The seller should specify this condition in the description of the product to avoid the problems associated with returning a product. I had not returned a product before this DVD and sometimes you do not have time to do this so I prefer to avoid this as much as possible. If I see this DVD available for my region (USA), I would buy it."
5,great actor .great movies,"it arrived today , looking forward to watching him in action again . i thought he was staring in all four movies .but he only stars in two .but that does not worry me . i just love to watch him and myrna loy together"
4,Excellent anthrological perspective on history,"I read this book for an economic anthropology class. I thought it gave an excellent anthropological perspective on how sugar changed history. Mintz makes some striking points on the influence of slavery on the development of capitalism, as well as drawing a parallel between the sugar plantations in the Carribean and the capitalist, industrial factories that developed shortly after. The book is packed with historical information, overall a really informative read."
5,This is a great album! Any Head East fan should have it!,"I bought this on vinyl so long ago, along with all of the Head East library. This is an awesome listen! CD quality is a great improvement to my vinyl. Get it! And, I now have a website for Head East, though it's not an official site (yet). http://www.users.uswest.net/~stumpf6/headeast.htm"
2,There are better ones out there,"Mediocre output from a band that put out some really good albums. Its self titled cd is arguably their best, and this is just awful compared to their earlier recordings. Keep a Secret is really bad and seems kind of forced to go forward. It is almost as if they just playing the same chords over and over until it mercifully reaches its conclusion, which is really weak, needless to say. Got to Be Real pretty much covers the same pattern as far as lacking a lot of power. Highlights on this one is Lonelier Now and Too Late. On Lonelier now, they got everything right for the most part. Too Late is just a catchy tune. Unlike their earlier releases, this one lacks any kind of power, to say the least. If you like this band, stick with its self titled or Flat as a Pancake to get a flavor of how good this band can be. This cd is a poor representative of this band's true talent."
3,Interesting but confusing,"This book has several interesting bits, such as the development of Corelle or why the Titanic sank. However, I was not very interested in the author's description of his career path or the listing of all the people he's worked with. Also I couldn't understand a lot of the physics he was trying to describe especially in the last few chapters. There's this extended analogy about mountain ranges and I still don't really know what he was talking about. I think if I'd skipped the last three chapters I'd have given it four stars."
5,Great cab,This is a great cab. Ive had it for quite a few years.The person above me must not know much about amp CABS if they put 'doesnt even power on without a separate head' well obviously. This is a cab.. as in speaker cabinetAll that it does is house some bad assed sounding speakers. Naturally it has to be powered by an amp. Id recommend the marshall Vintage modern 2466 all tube head. Thats what i rock.I highly recommend this
5,This just stays in the player most times.,With over 200 cd's from this genre in my collection. some just keep making it back into the player again and again. This is one of them. Buy it.
4,Very good vise,"It is precise and holds firmly the workpiece. Due to its reduced size, it fits very well on my Proxxon mini-mill. Despite its high price, above average, I do recommend."
3,"If pH is your only problem, this will work",I ordered this product when I moved and the new tap water had a pH around 8. Unfortunately I did the pH test before I checked the kh and gh... It turns out that my carbonates are super high so the pH regulator has no effect on my water pH. So if pH is your only issue I'm sure this product would work well for you. Before buying this you should make sure you don't have other water issues that would affect pH.
1,ASS,"Yup, sent me 2 CD's that don't work. Scratches all over the back of the CD, no artwork , no case. Plain and blunt, I got gypped."
4,"Review for ""Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles 2 Battle Nexus""","This was a gift for a good friend, and she loves it!! It is fun for boys and girls!! :)"
3,Still the Classic on the Trail,"This is still the classic on the Santa Fe Trail. Dary is full of facts and information it would take a lifetime to ferret out from other sources. Unfortunately, he misses the point entirely. Traders flocked to the trail to get rich. How? What goods went to Santa Fe? What goods returned to Missouri?New Mexico prior to the arrival of the railroads had a subsistance economy. It was metal poor. The tins that came down the Trail sparked an industry; the New Mexicans valued the empty cans and turned them into art. Poor in metal they lacked table utensils and even iron plows. They lacked basic metal tools to build furniture and so sat on adobe bancos. What wealth did the New Mexicans have to buy from the Missouri traders and make the traders rich?The truth is out there. Try Commerce of the Prairies."
2,Running down a rabbit hole...,"I'm a former Catholic and now belong to a Baptist church. In recent years I have also attended non-denominational churches that focus on God word. I study the ENTIRE bible, not just a few verses. I was told by a Facebook friend that this was a MUST READ. I only made it through about three chapters as I quickly identified that this author was running down a rabbit hole based on the euchrist. Having a relationship with God is personal and this book focuses on one man's obsession with the euchrist. I do not recommend this book and have REAL issues with the misguided teaching of the Catholic church. This book basically said in the few chapters I was able to digest that if your not Catholic... Your not ""being feed"". I couldn't more disagree with this man. BTW... I don't ever recall throwing a book in the trash. I normally pass a good book along or put it in my collection or give it to a resale book store. This book found file 13."
4,The Cello suite,"This edition is great, and with the articulations written in, it makes the piece much easier to learn and internalize."
4,It improves,"I was not so impressed by their previous album ""Letting go"", but this album is much better. It has the right sequence of songs and it keeps you listening.If you like bands like Lo-Pro and Shinedown, you will probably also like this album. My favorite track is ""Fall Apart""."
4,"Great story, quality of books is wanting","I give the story 5 out of 5 stars, however, the quality of the books themselves is wanting: All four volumes came to me inside their sleeves and shrink wrapped, yet there was slight scuffs to the covers! Also, volume four had one page folded over and miscut. For books that cost $99 each, there should have been more attention to detail/quality control. One last thing, although the story is one of if not the best comics stories out there, the art was sometimes not to my liking at all."
5,Read the small print,"What others had to say about this book are actually correct. But any book isn't totally complete and comprehensive.I wish this book were thousands of pages longer. I wish it covered every aspect of the world's battleships. There are always chunks of data I'd love to find in this category. A book that resembled a Wizards Tome, so large it would be difficult to turn pages and impossible to move.I have thirty or forty books on battleships, but, (and this is important), Jane's Battleships of the 20th Century is the first and last book when I have a question or desire a image."
2,"Pretty pictures, tons of errors.","This book has great artwork. Beyond that, I believe the book's text author (Bernard Ireland) didn't do his homework. There's no way to know for sure... the book doesn't have a references section... apparently Mr. Ireland wrote the whole thing from memory. If that's the case then it's trully a remarkable acheivement. The fact that this book comes under the auspices of 'Janes', one of the most accurate technical series in the world, is a disgrace. The technical data in this book is just plaing WRONG and shows a carelessness I didn't think a professional historian would allow."
3,Beautifully written...but the story...,"The author is very good in describing the various detail and is quite poetic. Which was the reason why I read the book. But the story really didn't tie-in together for me. Overall, the book was a very easy read."
4,early fags soundind,"This a sample of the fags before they became the fags ,and this is why i like music.You can hear the earily fags before they became the fags it is great.I like the last four songs on the cd the best but for the price on amazon,i mean comeon how can you go wrong a penny.If you like the fags try this cd iam sure it wont dissapoint you.I hope this review was helpfull to you"
3,"Great debut and second LP, but thats about it","These guys came out with a great debut (self titled), and then followed with an even better 2nd LP,Argus. After that it's just been downhill. If you're a completest go ahead and buy this one,buy all of them. However I suggest the 1st and Argus LPs only. If you're new to Wishbone Ash and just want a good album, then get the Greatest Hits or Best of witchever it's called."
4,wishbone ash rocks and has gotten better with time,"their unique rock jazz style transcends time by delivering solid underated gems. their song writing genius is top notch. if u like music with blazing guitars and harmonic balads, give wishbone ash a spin.their music in my opinion is as fresh as it was 35-40 yrs ago. that goes for any of their albums! this review wil act as a blanket for all their other albums released in the 1970's"
1,Disappointing show,"I saw this show last year with a free ticket. Unfortunately, I didn't get my value out of it. The music is pretty lackluster. The show had its moments, but I can't imagine the soundtrack being enjoyable in the least."
4,Great book for the beginner with MS Project,"This is a pretty good book on MS Project. Of course, there aren't many out there. It covers how to build projects, how to schedule resources, and what task slack is. It also covers how to use Project to report on your progress and it has a section that covers using Project in a workgroup environment.If you are a seasoned user of MS Project, you may not get much from this book, but if you are like me, and have used project for two years, and needed a reference manual, then books does a good job in that arena."
3,Is what it says...Heavy!,"Diggin the shape of these Zombie killers. For it's overall size, it is pretty heavy compared to other machetes of similar lengths. Very forward weighted. But then, what could be better for hacking away at the undead? I like to put a carriage bolt in the lanyard hole w a couple of washers to even out the weight a lil, and gives more 'meat' to the end of the grip.Handle is slightly akward in the hand, kinda big n flat, could be rounder for better comfort. My blade has an annoying slight curve from hilt to 'tip', a problem I also had w the Cold Steel Latin Machete. Looks like item may be a factory second. May possibly return it. Found out they're cheaper elsewhere too..! But hey, for something this inexpensive, I'm nitpicking. May just end up buying another one..!**5 stars for more ergonomic, textured grip, and a non-curved blade."
3,Great photos! Frustrating read & sometimes inaccurate text.,"Scotty Moore, Elvis' original guitar player and manager, recently said he thought he had seen every photo from that era until he saw this book. That's why I bought it. The photos, mostly performance snapshots, are great. Unfortunately the text is not. At best the writing gets in the way, and at worst it is just plain wrong (which Scotty warned me about). Still, this rare glimpse of one of the greatest American bands merits its recommendation."
2,Sarcastic author sounds unprofessional,"I bought this book because I'm writing Faron Young's biography and needed information on dates Faron and Elvis worked together. Lori Torrance lost my respect in the very first paragraph of the book, with her statement, ""Country music twanged on the radio, Hank Williams crying in his cornflakes again."" A few pages later, she says, ""At that time, easy listening and my-dog-has-fleas country music monopolized the mass music market."" The research was useful but the flippant writing was a turn-off."
5,It looked like a war zone in New York City,"As I watch the footage on this DVD, I get the feeling that I am watching a war zone. The scenes of destruction and the raging fires in lower Manhattan are tough to take. I still find it hard to believe that this really happened to our great city. I don't recall having seen footage thats on this DVD on any of the news networks. As the fires are raging you hear radio transmissions, ""There is no water in parts of lower Manhattan due to the damaged water mains"" You also hear the chilling radio transmissions of firefighters trapped calling for ""Maydays""!After watching this DVD, I felt sad and angry. It brought back the feelings I had immediately following 9/11. I recommed this DVD to anyone who has an interest in 9/11/01,"
3,A great ending to a series!,"Dragons of Summer Flame is great book, but lacked in chracter development and it lacked the compelling writing that one comes to expect of Weis and Hickman. I mean, Tanis is killed off within a few paragraphs. As Tanis is a central character he should have had a burial in the end as Sturm did when he died. Also, Chaos should have had more of a role. Let's see, I'm the most powerful being ever, but I don't get that much dialouge. I guess he was the strong but stupid type. I do not mean to knock the book, it truly was a great ending to a fantastic series, but it could have been written better"
1,It seemed way too rushed,"From the beginning of this book with the death of Cameron's sons to the sniveling cowardice of Reorx in the face of Chaos (he is a dwarven diety for heaven's sake!), I hated this book. No one was in character and it seemed to me that it was hastily concieved and executed to fulfill some contractual obligation instead of because the authors cared about the story."
2,Such a shame...,Don't read this book... it kills all you ever stood for!!Just read the Chronicles and the Legends (and eventually other good DL books like the Tales or Defenders Of Magic) but just pretend this one never came out...
2,A rush into the 5th age...,"Since I read the sneak preview in ""The Second Generation"" I have been waiting for this book. But I got really disappointed when I finally read it, the sole purpose of the book seems to be making room for the 5th age by killing the old characters as well ending the world of Krynn as we know it. Killing the old characters may have been unavoidable but the drastic changes to whole Dragonlance universe destroys the whole balance in the previous books. If TSR wanted a new world why couldn't they have made a new one instead of destroying a old one?The whole book have a ""rushed"" feeling about it and the character development is very weak. The old characters seems to be missing some of their charisma, especially Raistlin which return but without his magic which was very much a part of him and without it he's only half the man he used to be. Even the villian, Chaos seems very flat and boring so if you liked the other books in the DL series DON'T buy this book."
2,"Interesting history lesson, but very dissapointing","I was so excited to read this book and all (or most) of the characters i have come to love in Krynn. So instead i read about Palin, who was boring yet the most interesting of the three new heroes. Steele sucked. and Usha could have been much better. What i got out of it was the history of the creation of Krynn. That's all i really liked about it. More problems - Disabeling Raistlin seemed just too convienent for the plot. Oh, and after everything is said and done for, we get some wussy world with no resemblance to the one we all love. The only thing worth mentioning is that it will make an impact on you one way or the other. END"
5,Anawsome bookand a great conscription ofthe second cataclysm,"I thought that this book should be read immediately by all dragonlance fans who haven't read it yet. It tells a great story about Usha, child of the Irda, being cast out from the island of her homeland, and into the busy city of Palanthas. she undergoes more events than anyone with such a lack of experience should have to. but then she meets the whiterobed mage, Palin, and it all seems to become fine. and at the end, the fateful battle against Chaos, the Father of All and Nothing, in the Abyss."
2,Disappointing,"As a longtime fan and follower of the Dragonlance Saga, I can only call this 4th and heavily belated installment of Chronicles to be a major disappointment. Gone is the sense of purpose and adventure that made the original Chronicles and Legends trilogies so gripping. In its place is this, which almost reads like a comic book, with characters coming back to life and being taken away just as quickly. Most of the ""offspring"" characters developed in the Tales stories are killed off rather quickly, and other characters like Palin and Steele are not dealt with well either. Add to that the almost total destruction of the Krynn we all know from prior novels, and this is one fantasy disaster.For my part, I've tried to forget this was ever written, and until better comes along am sticking with the Legends trilogy as the final major chapter involving the heroes of the lance."
1,Stay away!!!!,"I grew up reading Dragonlance. I love Weis and Hickman's creation and still can't believe how they could destroy all that they built with one miserable book. This book is similar to the movie ""Highlander 2"" - it makes you want to forget you ever read it because it ruins everything you liked about the previous books. I was physically angry as I finished this book. Do not read it!"
1,Can someone give me a synopsis?,"I confess that I'm not a huge fan if the Dragonlance Series. I stumbled across the first War of Souls book and quite enjoyed that. To the point that I bought all the privious Weis/Hickman DL books. Unfortunately, it's taken me almost 4 years to get through them. I've finally made it to Dragons of Summer Flame.And I just can't take it any more. I really just want to skip back to War of Souls, but the compulsion to read books in order is just to strong.But I cannot get through this book. I made it to page 90. Just past the deaths of Sturm and Talin, which pretty much did it for me. Topped with the Usha character and her potentially for unlimited whinning, I just can't make it any farther.So if someone could just give me a synopsis of the important events, I'd aprriciate it.Because this book is just not worth reading. Let alone buying."
5,The Story of Wales,"Ahhhh, the story of how the Welsh became the sheep-shagging Fruitloops that they are. Where men are men, and sheep are scared."
4,Something different!,"I bought this because I love dinosaurs and Operation is such a fun game. It's a great spin on the concept.It comes with cards to use as you play the game, but some of the information on them is a little outdated. It was manufactured several years ago. Otherwise, great.The only issue with durability is the potential to lose some of the pieces, especially the smaller ones."
4,Accurate and well built,I was pleasantly surprised at how well built this guage was at such a great price. Very accurate and consistent. You can't go wrong with this guage!
3,As Good As You Get!,"The product appears to be exactly what I ordered and hopefully it will work well.Only one exception which detracts for the product, the face or plastic on the gauge was cracked when received"
4,Respectable Effort,"If you're like me, you first had this album on vinyl and then bought the CD issued in 1987 with 2 of the 4 bonus tracks appearing here. Now you're faced with the decision of buying the CD again (as a $22 import) for the 2 extra tracks--or even 1 extra track, if you have the single to ""Heart of Steel."" Is it worth it? Oh...I guess, if you're a hardcore fan. Both songs are in the ""good not great"" category.If you haven't heard the album at all, then it makes things easier; by all means, get it. But I think this ranks in the middle of Justin's solo releases (nowhere near the quality of Moving Mountains or View from the Hill). A lot of these songs go on way too long, given that many don't have bridges--or even 2nd verses! Consequently, they can be quite repetitive. But ""Songwriter Part 1,"" ""Raised on Love,"" and ""One Lonely Room"" are nice enough ballads, ""Lay It on Me"" and ""Country Girl"" good enough rockers, and ""Nostradamus"" has a lot of fun with its great string arrangements."
1,Amateurish Piece of Junk,"This dvd and the Blair Witch are the two worse movies I have ever watched. The camera work was horrible and done with a cheap home video camera and the dvd was totally unrealistic. Basically 3 city punks who know nothing about guns or hunting go off ""hunting"" in a city park with a paved jogging trail a few feet away. They are ""hunting"" in short sleeve tee shirts, all together tramping through what looks like a metropolitican city park. The dvd made no sense and was so boring and poorly done that I had to fast forward through it. The acting was nonexistent and the whole dvd looked like it was produced for less than $100 including gas. They probably spent more money paying off the reviewers on the cover than producing this piece of trash."
1,Boring and Redundant,This 200+ page book could have been condensed to 50 pages. Please discourage your school from assigning this book.
5,Wonderful,It makes your skin smooth and soft .Good for sensitive skin .Makes your skin glow again .A little goes a long way .
5,My fish are still alive!,This helps neutralize the chemicals in your tap water and makes your fish able to live in it. A MUST HAVE for your aquarium with every water change. Be careful though! A little goes a long way (which is good for your wallet)!
3,terrible smell,"It does a decent job, I don't see how it's any different from the other tap conditioner but the smell is horrible, I hate smelling it every water change.Best I can describe the smell is that it smells like potent sewer smell."
2,"Stinks, I use it sparingly, probably wouldn't buy again","Probably does the job, but at the same time I've lost a number of fish since I started using it.Will likely return to using Top Fin, as it doesn't stink of sulfur, and I feel more confident with it."
3,Not worth the money.,I can't tell any difference between this and using lotion. May need to use so many days in a roll for it to soften feet.
2,Didn't work,"I bought after reading all the good reviews and I followed instructions accurately, but this product works only as well as the pumice stone you have to use following. Certainly nothing magical about it."
2,Ok,No bett than any other regular lotion I've used on my feet. I didn't see anything miraculous happen. Jus basic moisturizing.
3,Did exactly what is said it would do.,This product works well....but you have to apply it daily if you want your skin/heals to stay soft. I mean if you miss a day your all dry and cracked all over again.
1,Junk,The handlebars looked great when I put them on my quad but they broke on the first use of them. They won't hold up under any stress of hard riding.
5,A revolution in the world of testing,"With Test Process Improvement (TPI) one is able to add a new dimension to test activities. TPI makes it possible to show the environment what and how the test process works. TPI makes it possible to improve the test process in logical and clear steps. TPI gives the answers for the test process which CMM did for the software process. For me it is a revolution in software testing. With TPI, testing has become even more interesting, dynamic and mature. It is a pleasure to work with it."
5,Great gift,"I bought this as a gift for someones birthday and i my self is please , they never stop talking of about and people never stop asking what fragrance you are wearing so for all you men who wants you lady to be a stunner where ever she goes use this product"
4,Almost Perfect,"I used the 1999-Aus book as a guide for my trip to Australia. From the very beginning where it guided me to the cheapest ticket to Sydney, I knew it was a great book. The maps in the book were good and the activities suggested were fantastic. If you are in college or recently out (like me) and you enjoy the outdoors this book is for you. Among my complaints were some of the food establishments suggested: one even made me sick. My other large complaint is that there are plenty of cheap hotels in Aus that aren't reviewed or suggested. Let's go seems to favor hostels above all else. The Final Word: If you need to plan your trip and want suggestions of what to see (anywhere, ANYWHERE in the country) then I whole heartedly suggest this book."
5,Awesome to take eggs camping!,"It always surprises me when I read reviews that say their eggs didn't fit and/or were broken by this container and, in fact, I initially hesitated buying one of these because of reviews by what I now consider to be stupid people.I've NEVER had LARGE size eggs break in these ... I own two containers now. Eggs have a pointy end and a flatter end ... if you put them in the right way THEY FIT and do not break! Well, maybe if you drop it on the floor or throw it into a wall your eggs will break ... come on, they are eggs - but I've never had one break so far. You can't control for stupid consumers - these work GREAT!!!"
4,A classic!,Many of us desire a more meaningful Jesus filled life but don't know who to get it and it is for us this book is written. Carroll teaches the fundamentals of worship from a pure heart. He also shows trouble spots that maybe stopping your worship. This is one of the best Christian books that I have read on worship.Also keep is hearing Jesus as he responds to pray. One of the best books on that is this one:Jesus: The Lessons Revealed
5,COMPILATION ONE,"I've always thought that a good compilation should present the songs I would have chosen if I had to produce the CD. And it's obviously the case with Cowboy Junkies's STUDIO : SELECTED RECORDINGS 1986-1995. Each one of the 14 songs is a favorite of mine.""Sweet Jane"", ""Blue Moon"" and ""Powderfinger"" are exceptional versions of classics and the Michal Timmins compositions presented in STUDIO are achievements in the canadian author-composer's career. There is only one until then unrecorded song ""Lost my driving wheel"" ; only a live version of this song was available on the precedent album of the Junkies : 200 MORE MILES.So this compilation should rejoice the CJ fan as well as the curious listener in search of original music. After a few listenings, he will soon order the whole musical production of this first-rate band.A CD for your library."
4,Bye Bye Critters,"Gone are the nasty neighbors cats & dogs... No more tossing away good shoes because they are fouled! Does not last as long as I wish, but a very good product... Thanks ww"
1,Useless,"This product did nothing to dissuade the neighbor's cat from using our vegetable garden as his personal toilet. I spread the thick, gelatinous gunk around the perimeter of our 10' x 20' raised bed garden on several different occasions, only find our purring perpetrator's special ""gifts"" semi-buried after each application. I suspect he rather enjoys the aroma and would probably give a five star review here. Like another reviewer, I also received ""Away from my garden"" ""crystals"" (not sure why they're called crystals - again, the substance is a gooey thick liquid) instead of the ""Get off my garden"" item. I suspect it's the same useless product with a slightly different inaccurate name."
3,"It's definitely no ""Silence""...","If you want to hear some amazing, totally original hard rock music, go buy Blindside's ""Silence."" Now, if you want to hear a couple more amazing songs with some watered down, run-of-the-mill hard rock thrown into the mix, buy this CD. As much as I hate to say it, this album really is only half good... songs like Follow You Down, About A Burning Fire, Eye of the Storm, and a couple others really stand out (even if they do just sound like a continuation of ""Silence""), but they're just not enough to make up for the other half of the CD--which is absolutely nothing special. I'd say that if you wanted to buy some Blindside, just buy ""Silence,"" and then shop around for the cheapest used copy of ""About A Burning Fire"" you can find."
2,Too Soft,"not as heavy as the first 2 blindside albums. Some different members in the lineup (i think). Too tamed sounding for my likes, i prefer the self titled/a thought crushed my mind albums."
4,I'm Digging It,"After hearing Christian's vocals on P.O.D's track ""Anything Right"" I picked up this cd the next day. I totally love this album. Although I wish Blindside would have had more christian oriented lyrics on this albums, the lyrics and the music on this album was just amazing. Shekina is a great song and I love Christian's voice on it. Follow You Down is a sweet track as well. The well-roundedness of Blindside is totally appealing to me. I love how they can maintain their style of music throughout the whole album and venture into different musical styles. This cd is amazing."
2,"Damn, and I ran out and bought it!","This is their WORST cd to date and I am pissed that I ran out on my lunch break to get it in anticipation. Silence, the album before this, was even pretty good, but this cd drags on and on until the last track which is okay. I swear this is the most boring cd that I have ever bought."
2,Meh...,"2003 Chevy S10 Xtreme 4.3L V6 ~~ Instalation instructions are horrible. Hardware is low quality. BUT! the TBS is a high quality aluminum and looks very nice installed. I noticed no power increase, but to be fair, if it only increased HP by 2-5 (like they advetise) then you will not really FEEL the increased HP. No increase in MPG, Zero... I keep a record of my MPG for work. So my final thought on this item is, ""If you have money to burn, buy it."""
1,Opinion of Pyramid PB180X 4ch. Amplifier,"It's a cheapo. I don't recommend it, as it reproduces a substantial amount of electrical (alternator) noise."
3,UPD ROOLS THE YARD,"I burrowed up d UPD's N.O to D.C dayblue. UPD is pure ""soft paws for earth, sharp claws for man"". I listen Twoo UPD she ale days. Move the money! Move me the money! THE UPD ROOLS"
4,Danskin core Ball with Balance Ring,Great product that works very well. The only problem is the balance ring came with a small hole in it and does not maintain an inflated state but the ball on its own is great.
4,Okay,This is a good ball and I like the fact that it comes with a ring to hold it from rolling for storage. I was attracted by the color but I've found that ball workouts are not for me. I may use it as a chair.
1,"Bad writing, plot holes, unsatisfying ending...","But other than that...! Really, this book was so badly written, the story was full of plot holes and awkward devices, and the ending was ridiculous. I would have stopped reading long before the end, but I was reading on the recommendation of a friend who wanted to discuss it. I can only assume at this point that I must have unknowlingly offended her and this was my punishment."
3,"Careful with younger readers. Amazing, high quality book.","This book started from the illustrations, and the text was added later. In fact, the text is hardly necessary, the illustrations are so compelling.A graphic representation of the history of enslaved blacks in America until emancipation - pulls at your imagination.Warning: Brutally realistic depictions of man's inhumanity toward man. Parents should pre-read. Teachers need to let parents know when and how the book will be used in a classroom setting."
1,Runs!!!,"So I bought these pantyhose at century 21, not even an hour I had two runs !!! I would not recommend these pantyhose ruined my night out :("
2,Not worth $72,"Package came with no instructions except for changing batteries, but the battery compartment cannot be accessed as it is under his coat, which doesn't come off. Also, both his hands came off easily but hard to snap back. Doll is not ""fully articulated"", and hard to keep upright. I expected better for $72."
5,Logitech Cordless Desktop LX 300,This unit works flawlessly. Right out of the box with no problems. Do yourself a fovor and stay with this rather than be tempted to go with the Logitech MX5000. That unit has way to many issues. After switching over to the LX300 life is a whole lot less frustrating.
2,Just OK...,"This is a decent product, but does have a few problems. There does seem to be interference that prevents the mouse from functioning fully and the range does seem limited. The mouse and keyboard do not work well enough for extreme gaming--there's too much delay and ""skipping."" The most recent problem that prompted me to write this review is several keys now stick and do not pop back up. The space bar is one of them. That is extremely frustrating. It either doesn't work because it's stuck half way down or it's stuck down repeatedly creating spaces. I didn't spill anything on it--I don't eat/drink around my computer. It just seems that it wasn't made to last for the long term."
2,To each his own!!,"Initially, I thought this was a fabulous product, but after a couple of months the mouse started 'acting up'. Changing the batteries only helped for a short while so I went back to using my corded mouse and keyboard. I was very disappointed!"
4,Lasted 2 years,"I purchased the previous version of this wireless keyboard/mouse combo and it worked great for almost 2 years then the wireless controller died! The batteries tended to last quite a while. I used rechargeables in it so about every 90 days I would lose a few hours while the batteries charged. For the most part the keyboard and mouse did not lose the connection with the controller. When it did it was simple to flip the keyboard and mouse over and reconnect them by pressing on the green button. Everytime you change batteries you will need to reconnect, at least in the older version. I did not use any of the hot keys on the keyboard but the keyboard and mouse did perform perfectly and kept my desk looking need. I got many comments on this set and most people who used it ordered a set for themselves. I would highly recommend logitech. I also used this set on 3 different computers with no compatibility problems."
4,pretty good,"batteries on the mouse dont last as long as they should, other than that its a well engineered product, great shortcut keys, easy set up."
5,Great Item,This is a great item. Works better than the Gateway setup I had before. Definately reccommend this item.
5,Delightful story about a cat and her human family,"This is a delightful story based upon real events of a cat and a baby that survive a flood in the Netherlands. The cat starts out leading the carefree single life, but changes in the human family at home forces a change in lifestyle as the cat moves from sleeping in a warm bed to sleeping in the windmill. During particularly stormy weather, a dike holding back sea water breaks and the whole town is flooded. The cat saves the life of the family's new baby, and later acquires the baby's cradle for a bed after the child grows older. The story is enjoyable for even mature readers."
4,Six Masters of the Spanish Sonnet,"This book is more than I expected. Excellent biographical information and literary context for the six authors. Relates the work of six great Spanish poets of different epochs. The translations are very helpful for someone who knows some Spanish. I would have preferred more literal and less poetic translations.(See Sor Juana de la Cruz, ""En perseguirme, Mundo, que interesas? ..."") Even a fine poet like Barnstone must take liberties with the original when he turns a Spanish sonnet into an English sonnet. This book is invaluable to the amateur and, I would assume, to the professional as well."
4,Nice Tow Bar for the money,"The first Tow Bar I received looked like it had been run over by a UPS truck and was missing several parts. Called Amazon and they quickly without question replaced it. Delivery was extremely fast. The Tow Bar is very sturdy and the anchor points are heavy duty. Dont forget to order safety chains as they dont come with it. Directions are very clear for the DIY. I purchased this for my 1994 Wrangler, I made a heavy duty bumper to replace the stock bumper and bolted it right on. No problems."
1,GET THIS GAME OUT OF ME HEAD!,"I HATE THIS GAME, AND I HATE VINCE & THQ TOO! THEY MAKE CLOWN GAMES, NOT WRESTLING! THIS IS FOR CHILDREN ONLY!"
1,"The game sold out, and WWE sold out too!","Not to mention about this game as mush as I hate it, and don't get to cacky about. This game will show you how bad it is once you play and played it, it makes no difference chump. So if you're playing it right now or starting to debut and playing it! Don't even so, and just throw in the mouth of the dumpster if you have to cause this game sucks & it'll attract you to have bad intentions!"
1,"They Dug This Crap Game From The Dead! And Don't Mistake Of The Undertaker, He Rocks, But This Game Doesn't!","I have no clue why would anybody recommended this game to be real good, as if they choked on crack or something. Because this game right here has 0 tolerence fun! No one cares for this game no more ever since HCTP hit stores about 3 years back! At least HCTP had more fun experience than this sorryass disc junk! As if like this game came out first than the regular PS1 WWE video games, and they where a lot better than this! But too bad, we'll never see those kind of the same features again from the past! Now we got the same old boring crap like the Gamecube style games such as Wrestlemania 18, 19, DOR1, & DOR2! All the gamecube games never have any similarities like PS games but this game is like one of them and boy does that want to piss so many people off! Now I know not to go near those previews again, that is them jokers Stacy & Torrie! But thank goodness it will not happen ever again!"
1,"Junk game, patoee!","Ew man! Vince McMahon on the cover is ugly! Not only that, the game has no features, no good playing system, or even good graphics here. Not to also mention the story mode sucks along with the cutscenes. I really don't count the cutscenes as good though anyways, cause the game ones aren't as good as the real storylines from the real WWE series! The character creation is downright bad or even terrible & it doesn't have options for face editing for the first time ever since the first Smackdown! game to HCTP had face edit options! Theres also no create an animation here neither at all like it had in SYM & HCTP! No Lumberjack & I Quit arent involved in this game anymore & the belt+ppv creations are sucked up or I should say mostly, F**KED UP!!!! I missed the past stuff from the past WWE games cause to tell you people the truth, theres nothing fun here in this game & it gets boring quickly faster than you can say ""FINISHED""!"
1,Jerks only have fun with this crap!,"If you're a good person, then this game is not for you & definately not even your play time. But if you're a jerk like stubborn Vince McMahon, then get this game & ******************! So deal with I have to say about that o(...)So think about it, be a lousy jerk like Vince or be a real good American person! Choose wisely!"
1,WWE goes straight to hell & I can't wait!,"Everything that WWE typical does, well mostly Vince that ruins the whole damn show! Their ratings aren't as quite good as many sport shows have like superbowl or def jam. Well, WWE tried their best by releasing DVD's & videogames like these right here but this game doesn't fit though & it won't hold you tight very long so get ready for the part that you'll have a seat & eat popcorn to watch the WWE fall in its place once they failed from succeeding, that I like."
1,What Happened THQ?,"You guys used to be off the chain man and now look, what the hell happened here? First we get all 5 successes for the past 5 games and now this is like a new beggining again or something! I have no clue why this game had to be released, but I'll be damned if they make another game with the same damn features again that're dopey! Don't get this disasterpiece, its a waste of gametime!"
1,"No wonder why everyone's dissing WWE, cause of this sh^t right here!","I couldn't believe that this sh^t had to be released back in '04, damn man! Thats why everyone moved on to TNA or some other shi^ that I don't know what but thats not the point. This game is the reason why everyones been hating on as much as I did & always do, the company is full of lack because of that crappy shi^^y owner, Vincent McMahon who screws everything up like a bull^^^^ that he is. But now, this is the last straw for WWE in my life, TNA awaits me!"
1,"1 star only people, just so you know!","Yep, only 1 star club only pals! This is for the ones who says this game is full of lack which it is. No one here wants this game anymore. I don't even think this game is worth more than 50.00 bucks! I don't give a damngone about this crap, screw this game and screw THQ with Vince too!"
1,"Good money, but not to use for this sh^t!","You people with good money better watch yourselves! Not because of someone try to rob you, its just this game is a fraud & it only temps you to buy this game just because of a stupid commercial! It mostly temps you to spend your moeny on this crap, but keep that in mind before you're forced to get it!"
1,"We have to go on stike, NOW!!","Lets go on strike so we can put an end to THQ's misery of game making! Them punks screwed the game up like its some cartoon network show ""Powerpuff Girls""! Seriously, those clowns can't even make a good if they even try to bring HCTP back! Thats never gonna happen again thanks to crapHQ!"
1,(...),"Who cares what other people have to say about good things for this game, all it is like a stupid ass Gamecube wrestling games, and thats what is all about! Theres no hiding your actions no more, so you better reveal y'alls true self and put Vince and THQ out of misery! Make'em go out of business and I don't care if WWE go's out of business, TNA is a whole lot better and more class acts than this clowny show WWC for World Wrestling Crap! I wished that WCW returns to kick not WWE wrestlers, but kick Vincent Krappy McMahons ass!!!!! How do ya like that Vince?"
1,HATING ME!!,"THIS GAME IS HATING ON ME, SO I TOOK IT BACK FOR MY LUTE IN RETURN! YES, THIS GAME DOES SUCK A LOT CAUSE THERES NOTHING FUN IN THIS GAME! ITS A WHOLE LET DOWN TO ME, YOU GUYS, THE SPORTS ENTERTAINMENT, AND MOST OF ALL, WWE THEMSELVES AND THAT ALSO INCLUDES VINCE AND FAMILY! THIS GAME IS LIKE A HACK THAT CAN'T EVEN GET HACKING, GET IT! HERE COMES THE PAIN WAS OFF THE CHARTS AND IT HAD GOOD EFFORTS WITH THAT GAME AND NOTHING LESS AT ALL. NOT ONLY THAT, IT HAD GOOD WWE CHARACTERS LIKE AUSTN, LESNAR, AND GOLDBERG! BUT NOW, GOLDBERG AND LESNAR WILL NEVER COME BACK AGAIN! BUT AT LEAST AUSTIN DID WITH SVR 2006! ALTHOUGH, DON'T PHRASE JUST BECAUSE HE'S BACK CAUSE HE'S NOT EVEN IN THIS GAME! COUNT IT ONLY ONE TIME HE WASN'T IN THIS GAME! ANYWAYS, JUST BECAUSE THIS GAME HAS NEW CHARACTERS THAT DOESN'T MEAN ITS A GOOD GAME CAUSE ITS NOT, REPEAT ITS NOT A GOOD GAME! THATS ALL I HAVE TO SAY ABOUT THAT!"
1,WHY IZ EVERYBODY AFRAID TO..........,"YO VINCE & THQ. WHATZ UP WITH YOU HOMIEZ OUT THERE, DRINKING, PARTYING, MONEY MAKING MOTHERF**KERZ. YOUR DAYZ OF BEING HAPPY MEN ARE OVER. ITZ TIME WE GET SOMETHING STRAIGHT OFF OF THIS MUG RIGHT HERE. WE DEMAND GREATER MATCHEZ LIKE HUM LETZ SEE, I QUIT, LUMBERJACK, AMBULENCE, STRECTHER, & A WHOLE NEW LOT OF JOINTZ DAWGZ. NOT ONLY THAT F--KERZ, THE GAMEPLAY YO HOMIEZ OUT THERE. IF Y'ALL DON'T GET THIS GAME RIGHT, WE ARE GOING TO F^^K Y'ALL UP HOMIEZ, PEACE DAWGZ!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!"
1,This Game Sucks+Vince Too= Terd Of Crappy F***ing Sh*t,"This game sucks d^^k. I agree the reviewer that said ""Ew, Vince Is Ugly"". Thats the truth, he is ugly & full of himself. I don't understand why those younger women want hang out with that old haggy. He's a married man & a pervert to younger women, shame on you Vince you PERVERT!!!!!!!"
5,This game rocks,I got this came when it came out and i have playing it since I got it. This game has superstar vioce over but the superstar you pick in season. This game has a new match called the parking lot brawl. There is a shopzone. There are more legends. There is also mini games like chop attack. You have to hit x twice to get a good or bad chop. There also is a shoving contest and a stare down. There is also a clean or dirty option for your superstar. Clean is the person that everyone likes and a dirty superstar is someone that everyone hates. Over all you should buy this game it is worth $50.
2,it doesnt work and has alot of scratches,it didn't work and has a lot of scratches.it would go dark once you pressed the start match button.
1,HOW CAN ANYONE STAND THIS?,"YOU GUYS NEED TO GROW UP, SERIOUSLY! I MEAN I CAN'T FIGURE OUT WHY AT THIS POINT THIS GAME HAS EVERYONE WANTS, DA NO!!!! IT DOESN'T HAVE CRAP FOR YOU! IT ONLY SHOWS THAT THQ ARE TRYING THEIR BEST NOT FOR THE FANS, BUT THE MONEY PEOPLE! THATS WHY I TURNED IT DOWN IN THE FIRST PLACE AS I PLAYED IT IN MY FRIENDS HOUSE! YEP, IT DOES SUCK BAD AND I HOPE THQ WILL QUIT WHAT THEY'RE DOING, CAUSE I'M PISSED OF'EM ONE BY ONE OF THEIR MISTAKES!!!"
4,Best Smackdown game in WWE history!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!,"The voice overs are good.But they took the WWE Tag Team Titles,World Tag Team Titles,and the WWE Womens Title.The new create-a-belt is cool.You can't create the roaters.And the season mode is too short.But the game is really fun.Buy it."
1,Could of been below negative if necassary!,"Damn right it could o been & should of if it wasn't for those goon who reviewed this as a so-called good game, but it really isn't! This game is an upset to people from nation to nation of the worlds! Stupid ass THQ decided to take the low way instead of the high way, thats why this game didn't get much payment for them! I hope THQ rots in hell for this piece of crap!"
1,"I pleaded for this game & my dreams came true, but then, my dreams where shattered.","If theres only one person that I could blame & I have the guts to say it in theirs faces would be Vince! I mean, the guys a hack, he can't wrestle, he tries to pick a fight with HBK now just because HBK told him that they'll move on! Can't Vince McMahon accept the offer that HBK is done playing with Vinces crap any longer now! Now he's having his son Shane & daughter Stephanie doing his dirty work now! Its only a matter of time before his ""WIFE"" would get involved & help Vince out do his ""DIRTY"" work for him too! I never liked the McMahons anyways, they all suck, can't wrestle, too damn money hungry crap & furthermore, stupidasses! Now, he has the cheerleaders that also can't wrestles named the Spirit Squads do Vince's ""DIRTY"" work for him as well! I call them ""GAY SQUADS"" because they're gay & nothing less! TNA is gonna kick WWE's ass one way or another!"
5,A pretty fun game,"I rented this game when it came out and I loved it. This sequel to Here Comes the pain is very cool. The story mode has the WWE superstars doing voice overs to add to the game. There are also secret characters to buy like Bret Hart, The Rock, Andre, and more. In this game insted of 5 smackdown icons they've been reduced to 3. This is probably the best smackdown game I've played. If you like this get Day of reckoning for GC."
3,Interesting book but hard to read,"I like the book but the reason I gave it a three rating was because it's hard to read. It's not for the novice; it's more a college type text book for someone getting their doctorial degree in history. The concept of myths and legends having a common origin is fascinating. I truly believe that if we want to learn about mankind before written history, the answers lie in our myths and legends. However, I had trouble making the connection between Hamlet and other ancient myths. The problem with this book is the author's do not get to the point; too much discussion about nothing."
2,A Physicist Is An Atom's Way To Know It Self,"Pynchon has great talent, but this is all. Too often many of us confuse talent with genius. I prefer to elevate under appreciated works like, The Man Without Qualities; better yet listen to Berg or Varese. The ""Theory"" of Post-Modernism is just the playing out of inovations stipulated by the ""Modernist"" movment in The Western classical music tradicion (either that or Mallerme and Duchamp). Unfortuantly the Dutch language is under appreciated. If you can find a translation (or know Dutch), read J.C. Bloem. I was prompted to set this review by going over other ones present here. I must say out of them all, I think the best remark was the fictious paper title:""Finnegan's Wake: I Understood the Whole Thing"". All and all, I find Post-Modernism highly bankrupt. I for one get tierd of read some architectonic work about the ""qoutidian"" world (Pynchon fits in here). And by the way Tom, that recluse act was best done by a more entertaining author, B. Traven."
5,An excellent novel.,"I don't understand most of the criticisms of this novel. In V. I found engaging writing, characters I was interested in (even if not personally attached to), and an intricate but palpable narrative. Despite what some of the negative reviews will have you think, V. is not overly erudite or confusing; in fact at times I thought the figurative details were almost too obvious and heavy-handed. It requires no more thought to analyze than any other quality work of literary merit.And despite my copy being about 550 pages, the novel didn't drag or lose wind at all. This is the shortest long book I've ever read--I enjoyed every page of it."
5,An American Treasure,"Guy Clark is one of the greatest singer-songwriters of all time. Just ask Steve Earle, Lyle Lovett, or any of the hundreds of others who have been influenced by him. This collection contains all of ""Old No. 1"" and all but one song from ""Texas Cookin'."" If you can find the Sugar Hill re-releases of those original albums, buy them. If you can't find these, buy this CD, then buy his later albums. It's a great starting point for any newcomer to Guy's music. You'll still hear many of these songs in his live show."
3,"I love it, but......","Awesome product, Chanel's shadows are one of the most color saturated products on the market and lasts all day, thus making it worth the price of a lot of small appliances. But $72.00 plus shipping???????????? Folks, Chanel's website sells this very same product for $59.00 with options for free shipping... don't be fooled. This is a serious scam and you don't need to fall for it because you think you're getting a better price because you're on Amazon."
1,Don't waste any time trying to find a copy of this,"When this book was written (mid 1990's) it contained some small elements of truth. Most of it however, even at that time, was a collection of nits which only the most deranged would find amusing.From the perspective of UNIX/Linux in 2009, there is little relevant in this book. Mercifully, it's long out of print."
2,WHAT THE HECK,"How can you make a yugioh game without any magic or trap cards and only monsters.This just ruined the whole yugioh experience.But there is a bright side to it though, the voices of it is good and they do have everybody on there.But other than that it sucks I beat the game the same day I rented it, it's a shame I hate to say but DOTR is better than this game at least they have magic and trap cards like the real yugioh."
5,"I know this game, this game was played by yugi and Mokuba","I would love to have this game. And for the greedy, dumb @$$ who said what the(beep)is that, it is a game for which yami yugi and Mokuba played in the yugioh manga's/shonen jump. They are $5.00 each.(cheap price huh?)Then, you'll understand this game. So, now ya know what the game is when ya read it...what are you waitin' for?! GET READIN'!!!!!"
2,It's mmmkay,"It's good if you are about 12. At least that is the reading level of this book. Super easy to read, which can make it a bit boring. I felt there wasnt enough character development."
5,joyfull compassion,"This CD is fantastic. The lyrics to the songs on this CD are encouraging (Sometimes He calms the storm and sometimes He calms His child), thought provoking (The main thing is to keep the main thing the main thing),and comfort the song,""Reason To Live"", talks about God being...""my reason to live, my reason to love, my reason to try when I want to give up"". Scott Krippange and Charlie Peacock make this song a winner in every way. Scott co-writes almost all the songs on the CD and you get the sense that this is a man with great honesty in his life and his music. He sings about hard times and leaves you feeling better for it. Praise God for his ministry."
2,ugh,"Pop tarts disgust me. They're much too dry and are flavorless, unless you count rotting cardboard as a flavor. Have you looked at the calorie content? 200 calories for just one? And who eats only one pop tart? I'm not one who is usually concerned with calories and the like, but 400 calories? And they don't even taste good.1 star for their visual appeal and the fancy silver wrapper they come in."
1,What was I thinking?,"As a kid I loved Pop Tarts but I tasted this flavor again recently and had to ask myself ""What was I thinking?"" The Smores' flavor is not too bad but all the rest pretty much taste like cardboard. This particular flavor resembles frosted and chalky, crumbly drywall with a layer of pink paste in the center. Heated it's a little softer but not much better. As one reviewer pointed out, it's a lot of calories and sugar for something that doesn't really taste that great. If I am going to have junk food I will at least pig out in style and get something tastier! There are many reasons why I am happy to be an adult and would never wish to be a kid again, this product (Along with Fruit Loops and grape soda, eeeuuuw!) IS one of those reasons! No offense to anyone who likes these, I think I just outgrew them."
4,"A ""should"" read","As I See It, Manohar Publishers & Distributors, a collection of essays, confirms V S Ravi's reputation as a profound thinker on a variety of subjects. Sometimes irreverent and often the humorous, but never malicious, his essays are an invitation to think about life in ways suggested by great literature and only now beginning to be recognized by science. Ravi, eschewing the prosaic language of the academics and turning to the poets for linguistic inspiration, introduces the reader to a variety of disciplines and subjects. Whether he is exploring the human condition or gently chiding his ""American cousins"", this collection of essays is as interesting as it is inspiring. His essays on science introduces the non-scientist - a concept that may not sit happily with Ravi - to some of the most important contributions of science to the business of ordinary living. As I See It is not just a ""nice"" but a ""should"" read!"
1,never again,When the magazine was delivered to my home i opened it up to find the upper half of the magazine completly gone but yet they had the nerve to put it in a plastic sleeve. So disappointed.
4,What Happened?,"Who selected the tracks for this collection? I could smack them! People wonder why Diana has been absent from the charts for so long-this is why! On top of the WELL-KNOWN fact that during her stint at RCA the label released ALL THE WRONG SINGLES. And to top it off they make a hits package with her weakest material. If you're going to include LP tracks, at least select good ones. What happened to ""Still In Love"", ""Love Lies"", ""You Do It"", ""Love Will Make It Right"", ""Touch By Touch"" (which should have been a single to begin with), the sweet 1986 radio remix of ""Chain Reaction"", ""All Of You"", ""Don't Give Up On Each Other"", ""I'm Watching You"", ""Dirty Looks"" (hello, that one WAS a single!), ""There Goes My Baby"", and ""Shockwaves""! Most of these weren't ever singles (stupid move RCA- way to cost yourselves money) but would have been perfect for an apparent ""Best Album Tracks"" collection."
2,THE INCREDIBLY IMPOSSIBLE!!,ALL I HAVE TO SAY IS WHY WOULD THEY MAKE A PG RATED MOVIE AND THEM MAKE A TEEN RATED GAME? MY 5 YEAR OLD IS CRYING HIS EYEBALLS OUT BECAUSE HE CAN'T GET PAST SOME OF THE MISSIONS! I FIND MYSELF DOING HALF OF THE MISSIONS! THANK GOODNESS I FOUND A CHEAT CODE OR WE WILL STILL BE STUCK FIGHTING THAT HUGE BALL INSIDE THE VOLCANO! DISNEY REALLY DISSAPPOINTED ME. GREAT MOVIE! TERRIBLE GAME! KID MOVIES SHOULD APPEAL TO KID GAMES! REMEMBER THAT HOPEFULLY WITH CHICKEN LITTLE!
1,Incredibly average,There is no way this game is getting 5's from people on this site. Ask yourself has there EVER been a good Pixar game in the history of video games? There are tons of good quality choices for kids out there. I would pass unless you are a die hard fan of the movie.
5,Theology of the Body,"Easy to understand summary of teachings of Pope John Paul II. Every parent of teenagers, teacher of teenagers, teenagers, married and un-married people should read."
3,problem,"i am having a problem that whenever i turn the h10 on, it scrolls up and down through the menus all by itself. it could do this all day if i let it. the only thing left to do is call iriver support but we will see how far i can get with them. other than the scrolling problem i like it. not a bad mp3 player."
2,player unusable after 2 weeks,"90% of time it is turned on, it displays ""system files missing , please upgrade. blah blah blah"" and goes into a freeze mode where it wont even shut down. took me 3 hrs to upgrade to 2.51 version but problem is still there.connection between player and comp. keeps breaking up. every 2-3 min it gets resets, so song/file transfer stops.donno if it is a general problem, or with my unit specifically. anyway i returned it.."
4,Please be aware that...,"The user manual for the iRiver H10 states that Windows XP and Windows Media Player 10 are both required. Without these, you can't add or manage files or playlists."
2,I used to love it!,"But now its gone bad!! Iriver support is not responding. I can't down load the updater to my H10,it won't reformat, and emails are getting me nowhere. Worst yet I miss my music. Like a relationship gone bad, it was great while it lasted, but the end was really sour."
1,do not buy it,"I bought this to use with Napster To Go. I love Napster's licensing. Love the idea of Napster To Go. I love music. I love pie. But seriously, this thing doesn't work. I've reinstalled Napster from scratch, reformatted the iRiver H10, removed all other USB devices, tried during different phases of the moon. It all ends up freezing the H10, which then looses all my playlists. My track list containes jumbled garabage. It's really a worse case scenario. This is the first device that has ever bummed me out so much that I've felt compelled to write a review.The good news is, I bought it on Amazon. And Amazon's return policy is awesome. Coming back at you iRiver."
5,The voice of love,The beautiful voice of John Gary will carry your message of love loud and clear.It is a gift you can give from the heart.The selections are perfect and John's 3 octave talent is awesome.Listen to it once and you will agree. Listen to it with someone you love and you will never forget the moment.
2,John Gary Review,"I may be getting older, however I enjoyed the original album better for some reason. I am not sure what the reasoning is behind this. Quite frankley I did not like the CD at all, another dust collector/storage hog."
5,The Very Best of John Gary,It is too bad that an Artist with a voice like John Gary had died so young. He had a great future ahead of him
3,A very different style of music.....,"Let me first start off by saying that if you buy this CD expecting to hear Jessie David Leach's amazing KsE style vocals i'm afraid you've wasted you're money. Seemless is a sort of southern-rock style music that is a lot more subtle than KsE was. It's not bad, its a good listen if you're in a chillaxing mood. If you're in a fist-raising/head pounding mood then its not the right album. That being said its a pretty good album in and of itself. I'm not quite sure yet if I like it or not. I'll have to listen to it more throughly. Like I said before you need to be in a chillaxing mood. I'll probally edit this review when I listen to this CD more."
3,Seemless - maybe too much,"This album sounds so much like COC its hard to even give them a chance. Staind and Creed sound very different anyway so obviously this person below likes COC and doesn't like Seemless, so he's saying that they sound like both Creed and Staind -- Pretty moronic and everyone reading your assanine review knows that Creed and Staind have totally different sounds (both fairly objectionable - but different).The disc has some problem with sounding repetitive. That might change after more listens. But what won't change is the shameful emulation of COC. There might be some other influences in there that I'm not identifying, but I am familiar with 2 of COC's records and this is pretty much christian rock level of emulation.But I wouldn't crucify anyone for liking this. I know most bands I love can make almost no claim to originality, but the COC thing is just overbearing for me. Can't get past it."
2,"Disappointing, but still worth the listen","I have to say that I had alot of preconcieved ideas going into this album and I was very excited about a return from Jesse David Leach. He is a very talented vocalist, I am glad to see him back at it.I must say that this album didn't do alot for me. I thought that one song was extremely impressive, but the rest of the album left me hanging almost all of the time, and Leach's vocals never reached the extreme limits that they once did. It is not a bad album, but with my ideas going in, I definetly would have liked a little bit more passion, energy, and aggression from these guys. Definetly a band to watch for a few years though."
4,Another mistake on Amazon's part.,"Amazon has this band grouped with the likes of Bloodsimple, DevilDriver, Trivium, Soilwork and a bunch of other HORRIBLE metal bands. Please don't buy this expecting anything of the sort. The cd kicks off with Something's Got To give which sounds more like a slightly heavier Soundgarden than anything. Next up is the Wanderer, continuing the grungy Soundgarden-like vocals and some of the most impressive guitar work I've ever heard right as he goes into this Pantera-ish metal breakdown. But the metal these guys play is more like older metal mixed with nu-metal and not quite the crap that passes for metal today such as the bands previously mentioned in this review. This is, quite simply put, badass rock/grunge with a lil metal thrown into the mix for good measure, dont be mislead by the similar artists category posted on here."
4,Very Good Bike Rack,"This is a very nice bike rack for the money. I've been able to get my mother's bike on this rack without using an adapter bar. Sometimes it can be difficult to get some bikes on, but I haven't had a bike that I couldn't get it on it yet.It does exactly what I needed it to do and I do not think I would have been more satisfied with a more expensive rack."
3,un-ultimate,"Don't get me wrong, I'm a big Guess Who fan, but this collection does not include their very best recording, ""Nashville Sneakers"". If anyone knows how to find this recording, please let me know.Recommended: ""Pentatonic Scales for the Jazz Rock Keyboardist"" by Jeff Burns."
2,Nashville Sneakers,in response to Guess Who fan looking for Nashville Sneakers...Contact at email address.
4,"Not the best, but not terrible either","My initial problem with this DVD was that I couldn't ""find"" anything but the short aquarium segment. Thanks to help from another Amazon user, I was able to access the other ""scenes"" (using the menu/pop up function).Okay, so this still isn't the best quality video (does NOT seem to be blu-ray, that's for sure) but at least I got more than about 20 minutes of film. It works nicely as background visuals and it's super cheap, so I can't complain too much.I have to thank the person who left a comment for me on my initial review, explaining how to get to the unusual menu -- otherwise, this would be in the trash at this point. Sometimes, people can be so nice!"
4,The smart take on initiative,"Corporate employees must contend with downsizing, scarce jobs and scarcer benefits. In today's virtual corporations, a handful of employees do the work that many people used to do. To survive, make yourself an irreplaceable employee. That's the short, sweet, familiar point (and the only message, given the book's brevity) that Bob Nelson conveys in this simple but clear manual for long-term employment survival. Take the initiative, assume responsibility, know your job better than anybody else and fulfill your supervisor's expectations - even the unspoken ones. Become indispensable: it's here in a nutshell. We find that Nelson provides valuable tips on being a proactive employee and, for fun, illustrates them with some bright little stories."
5,Kalapana 2,"Of the 12 songs on this album, 8 songs were constantly played on Hawaii's radio stations in the seventies. Mackey and Malani what voices! (For You) I'd Chase A Rainbow still gives me chicken skin (in a good way). This album is equally as good as their first album!"
1,Absolutely horrible,"I fell in love with blood orange juice while in Italy in 2009. The color of the juice and flavor were amazing. I have been looking for this in the US and when I found this product on Amazon, I had to order it. It arrived and when I opened it, I noticed the color was brown and not the deep red pictured on the product page. When I tasted it, while not spoiled, it tasted more like really sour grapefruit juice than blood orange. Maybe I got three bottles from an old batch (the juice was the same color in each of the bottles), but combined with the disappointing flavor, I'm tossing them in the trash. Buyer beware."
3,It was an ok book!,I thought it was a very different book. At one point in time it got really boring than it got good. There were times when I was going to sleep and than others I couldn't put the book down.
4,The Apocalyptic Jesus,"This book is very well writen. It is done in a well thought out manner and the layout and discussion parts are excellent. It would be good to have a decent handle on recent theology, however. It will breach some answers and conclusions that will need prior knowledge for the reader. Dale Allison does a fantastic job with his argument and ideas. It is a great book for those considering the idea of the Apocalyptic Jesus."
4,Good,"These four Nero Wolfe and Archie Goodwin are memorable because as one of the reviewers said in all of them Wolfe is in a tight spot and in three out of four he is in that tight spot due to his character flaw acting up :). Usually I feel that Stout novellas are way too short, still read them for Archie and Wolfe banter, but mystery leaves me wanting. I really liked the mystery in the last story."
4,Fun Four,"Even though I much prefer Stout's Nero Wolfe novels to the Nero Wolfe short stories, I enjoyed this shorter-than-usual batch of four. In the first, Wolfe plays Santa Claus because he thinks Archie is going to get married and leave him. Naturally a murder occurs -- and it looks as if the man playing Santa did it.In the second story, Wolfe goes to embarrassing lengths to procure black orchids that don't belong to him, and the result is murder. And it looks to the police as if an employee of Wolfe's (not Archie) committed the murder. If the police only knew that Wolfe was having the event filmed and has hidden the film from them, there would be even more trouble.The third story involves a Fourth of July picnic, Wolfe as the invited speaker, and somebody stabbed in the back while recovering from eating bad snails. The fourth story goes back to the French Resistance during World War II, the murder of traitors, a new life in New York City and then -- more murder.All told, short but satisfying."
5,Diet and Nutrition book,I purchased this book to give as a gift. It arrived on time and was exactly what the book I wanted!
4,Yummy and easy,I thoroughly enjoy taking cooking workshops from Merideth and these recipes are very flavorful and easy to prepare as well as being very healthy for you. She is very knowledgeable on the subject of macrobiotic diet and wellbeing.
5,That good old fashioned comb,"fits in your pocket and does not brake.In my area all you find is the made in china brand brittle junk at a high price.This one came quickly at a good price, probably less than the CVS price, shipping included."
2,Maybe you should buy the BOXED album.....,"This acoustic album really offers you a lot, if you like ""bossa nova"" or music like that. It isn't bad, but, the strange versions of ""Noah's Dream"" and the medley they made, will bring you a deception. ""In the Mood"" is only for fans, and if you want to save your money, buy the BOXED album, it includes their first album (In Control), and the EP ""Open The Gate And Watch"", ""More Histeria"" and the bonus ""Rising Sun"" (live). The other CD on this box set is ""In The Mood"", with the original booklet, so buy it."
5,Salter Delivers,"I am extrememly pleased with my new Salter scale. When I first received it, I hated what it had to say, but 16 pounds later, I am falling deeper and deeper in love.Thank You, Salter!"
1,lisad,this product is not a lotion at all. it is an aftershave splash- very watery. halston used to make a true lotion which is what I was looking for. as I recall now it was called a soother. this is not that product and the name is misleading. a lotion to me is smooth and conditioning.
5,Thrilling and athmospheric,"That's a book magnificently written, devilishly coiling the reader in a chilling spiral of madness and evil.The title is truly apt. The athmosphere of late forties -early fifties New York is magnificently rendered. As for the occult part,it's interesting to note that one of Dashiel Hammett novels, The ""Dain Curse"", also featured an occult sect. This novel has all the crisp pacing of Hammett and Chandler's labyrinthine convolutions of plot. Esgar Allan Poe meets Jonathan Lethem A must read!"
4,Short gem of a book,"Sometimes a book just grabs you by the throat, and you are hooked. ""Falling Angel"" is a mixture of horror and mystery, written in a stark, poetic language. It has all the right ingredients for a scary novel: voodoo, Satan worshippers, horrific murders.The plot seems impossible, but frighteningly probable, if you possess a flair for supernatural. This is a short gem of a book from times bygone, when the imagination was scarier than the world we live in."
4,A rare organ gem at a too-precious price,"This slection of Knecht music includes several good numbers, especially his ""Cappricio in E minor,"" but good luck finding it at less than $35. Thrifty music lovers may wish to inspect their local university library rather than ordering this on amazon."
5,excellent! A must have for any Cary Grant fan.,I received this book as a gift. It serves as an excellent guide to one of the most graceful and wonderful men of Hollywood. The pictures are beautifully arranged and capture the essence of who Mr. Grant was. Even the youngest Cary Grant fan will want to own this book.
2,Kind of bland,"After playing this game (which was difficult to do since no instructions were furnished with the game) I found it rather boring. It didn't have the zest or the excitement of Trophy Bass 4. The player can't go from lake to lake if he wants and there is a limited number of baits, rods, and reels to use. Almost everything could use improvement. I tried using ""HELP"" and other functions that I could find but none of them contained the information I needed, for example, how to release a fish once inside the live well. My computer won't play Trophy Bass 4 anymore. It's too ""fast"" and the CD can't keep up."
4,She liked it...,It's exactly what my Sister-in Law wanted for Christmas.I think it smells pleasant and it is not too pricey.
1,Horrible packaging!!!,"When I got my orders, the contents spill all over the box. The products are great but the packaging is horrible. One of my orders, liquid hand soap, only half content remained in the bottle. Very disappointed!"
5,Nice quality,"This mattress pad is plush, soft and comfortable. Washed it recently for the first time and the quality held very well. Fits the mattress nicely and doesn't move around."
1,what diffrence,"Well made utter waste of time . The only thing I think it is useful for is perhaps if you have a stained matress is to cover it . Very thin offered no extra support far to thin to make any diffrence to the bed. I expect a pad to be padded, but that said well made but I would class only as a thick fitted sheet."
3,Its not exciting or interesting,"When I ordered this book, my children and I were planning our Orlando trip. We also ordered a Disney World book. When both arrived, only one book was ever read - the Disney book with vivid color pictures giving detailed descriptions of the attractions. Guess where we visited?This book is dull. I feel bad for saying it, but there are only words - no pictures, so of course the kids had nothing to do with it, and without the kids interest, I hardly even looked at it either.I started to give this book a two star rating, but since it is informative, I bumped it to three."
1,This book is an ad,"Gosh, golly, WOW!!!! Universal is great!!! This is about the extent of Ms. Monaghan's guide. You might as well get your information direct from Universal--at least then it's free."
1,Don't bother,"I work at Universal...don't waste your money. Just go to the park and ask an attendant near the front gate or the first ride you go to to help you plan your day, and they will. We're trained to, and we know when stuff is going to be busy on each particular day."
2,I Am My Mother's Memory,"Read it, and put it down. If any of this is true, then it makes Golda Meir sound like a little old woman that sat around and whinned all day. If any of this stuff really happened then why hasn't Leah been given the US Freedom Medal?"
3,OK High Step,"The High Step is as it was described. I received what i was expecting; however, I feel the price is a wee bit high for the product. I paid the price because I needed the step but I wouldn't recommend spending the money unless you don't really care about price."
1,Looking for the Original,"I have looked for the original ""Rise and Fall of the Third Reich"" with Richard Basehart narrating. I ordered two of these, but they had someone else narrating. These two hour versions are a rip off. They don't even come close to the verson aired on TNT back in the 1990s, which probably did not come close to the original 6 hour version. I contacted the Wolper group at USC and they told me that the original version can only be viewed there. It apparently was never released in the original version. Don't be fooled!"
2,Good for only a year give or take...,"Well I loved this Fm radio adaptor for my nano but it's been almost a year and it started acting a bit funky till the next day it just stopped working completely. So if I were you, do not waste 45-50 dollars on this merchandise if it's not going to last. I love apple but the fact that they didn't want to give me another one makes me not want to buy there product. The reason they ask for more money for a 2 year guarantee is because their products will eventually stop working. THIS IS JUST A WARNING:)"
2,Disappointed,I found the quality of sound in my car was a fraction of that when using an input socket - and regular interference on the road - far too expensive for what it is - poor poor quality signal bears no relation to what you hear on phones...
3,"Good Product, but...","I'm over all very happy with the purchased, but would appreciate if the clip open end would made for lefy too. Also, it's impossible to charge your ipod while the radio remote is in use."
3,Ehhhh,"I had two dissapointments with this product.1) No AM radio. I am looking closer now at the product description and it says it clearly enough, but anyway, this was a dissapointment.2) I bought the apple Stereo to go with the IPOD. I can't listen to the radio on the stereo because the docking port on the IPOD is the same spot the radio plugs into.3) The reception is just ok. The thing goes in an out of reception depending on which way its pointed unless you are in a great reception area.This thing is OK at best, and way overpriced at $44 to what amounts to a pocket radio. One can buy a pocket radio for $8 that plays FM AND AM and works just as good."
2,Ipod Radio remote,"The cord is way too long - it gets in the way for any sort of use. I do not recommend this product, it needs serious work on the design."
4,Excellent accessory,"I have the radio remote attached to my iPod almost all the time--mostly for the convenience of being able to adjust volume and change tracks from the handy clip-on controller. The only reason I didn't give it 5 stars is that this is actually my second one: After a year and half of heavy use, the first one just stopped working. But I'd grown so attached I had to get another!"
1,This Kindle version is not a translation of what St. Therese wrote,"This Kindle version of ""Story of a Soul"" is an obsolete (early 20th century) translation into English of a version of St. Therese's classic autobiography heavily edited by her sister Pauline, who made about seven thousand changes to what St. Therese wrote. Since 1956 Therese's authentic manuscripts have been available. To read them, choose the paper edition:Story of a Soul: The Autobiography of St. Therese of Lisieux, Third Editiontranslated by Fr. John Clarke, OCD and published by ICS Publications in Washington, D.C."
2,Not a great book for the basics,"After a chapter or two I gave up...the book wasn't written well. Kinda boring, didn't grasp the reader at all...i think the idiot's guide to the torah was a great book...this was a disappointment."
3,Torture to Read,"It's described as a ""world famous classic"" and it may be, but I found it almost impossible to read. The plot involves teleportation (but only one-way) to a distant planet, that's being promoted as a utopia, but may be a giant slave labor camp. The universe is controlled by a few very powerful groups in constant warfare. Nothing is as it seems, and perception itself is constantly changing, revealing a universe of parallel worlds.I would have given the book two stars, but I did manage to finish it, hence the third star. Reading it was torture. Author PKD is brilliant and clever, writes in devilishly complex puns, symbols, allusions and made up words, has uncanny unsight into the nature of consciousness, but--he is simply unreadable.The Unteleported Man is out of print and would never be published today. The author could have said it all in half the pages. Sorry, I don't recommend this one. Reviewed by Louis N. Gruber."
2,"First half great, second half - what?!?","I have to agree with others here who lost track of the book in the second half. Seriously, he gets hit by the dart and suddenly I'm reading a new, very strange book. Can't recommend it."
2,If a CD holds 80 minutes.....,"I've now ordered this CD twice....I acknowledge the first time I ordered it, I missed a comment from the seller that the copy they had only contained the first 11 tracks. But the second vendor also sent me only the 11 track version. I'd actually like to get a copy that has all 18 tracks. The original 11 tracks from the movie soundtrack use less than 25 minutes of CD space....one would think RCA would put two movies on the CD much like they do with Jailhouse Rock/Love Me Tender....."
2,Cheap quality,Why weren't the cards pre cut. My son did it and naturally tore a couple. The mat on which we play is too thin and will surely tear soon.Apart from that everything seems fine.
4,Packed with pictures but not for budget traveller,"The book is very nice for pictures. Information is not in-depth, though. Furthermore, a budget traveller should use it together with some ""survival"" style book (e.g. ""Rough guide"")."
5,Very Good Overview of the Country,This book is a very good overview of the entire country. After traveling there 3 times in the past 3 years I have used this book as a good start for exploring the culture. Although it doesn't touch much on the modern way of Moroccan Culture it gives a good insight to the country and what it has to offer. It also has very detailed maps of all the major parts of the cities one would visit. A must for anyone considering visiting this country.
4,Good value.,The price is better than I could find locally. There was a problem with the initial order not containing all of the ordered product but it was taken care of promptly.
5,Our 20-month old and 3-year old love this book,"I ordered the book for our kids after getting a positive review from a friend. When it arrived, I didn't have the highest expectations and wondered how our kids would respond. They have LOVED it and my 20-month old will often go pick it out from the bookshelf when we're reading books. I'm a little surprised, but it's probably his favorite book right now. Highly recommended for toddlers."
5,"Wh-wh-what? Oh, I get it. Oh, no I don't.","I enjoyed this book, although it frightened me. In fact, I found it frighteningly enjoyable.The only author who I can readily compare this to is Matt Wall, who may have stolen most of his ideas from Mr. Ballard. We can only hope that Mr. Ballard wins several prizes for this work, and the respect of the literary world that he so richly deserves and didn't recieve with his earlier works."
3,Interesting but flawed,"This book provides an interesting glimpse into live during the late nineteenth century, and the evolving role of women in society. It also explores the impact our choices have on our lives, as well as on our families and communities.Unfortunately, the dialog that forms the framework of this book feels forced, without a natural flow, which detracts from the overall impact. However, the first person accounts connected by this dialog are quite good, and often very moving. Overall, a good book for anyone interested in what life in nineteenth century America was like."
4,Book is too small for price,"This book contains many hilarious ""hang in there"" pictures with animals looking stupid. It's a good gag gift for office workers, school teachers, or people who like to put funny things on their living room table. The only problem with it is that it's only about the size of a DVD case."
2,Boring,"Don't buy it, it is really really boring. Uncomfortably numb to watch, I started to do it but had to stop... just a waste of money"
3,Beware the CD,"Book 5 stars. CD 1 stars. I have just finished the Net8 part of the book. I got a very good understanding of all the options. I can highly recommend the book for the text and the offline review questions. The CD is frustrating. All the answers are one question off. (i.e., on question 1 it gives the answer for question 2). When you score the exam you look like a fool. If you click on the answer button, the explanation will give you the appropriate answer."
4,the whole is fine but week on performance tuning,"the set of book is fine and easy to read, but the performance tuning part is week, don't rely on it to pass the exam. but the other part is good."
3,"Good narrative, but needs a map or two","I was looking for a well-reviewed one volume history of the American Revolution. The narrative certainly delivered. However, the editor allowed what is essentially a military and political history to be published WITHOUT A SINGLE MAP! I deduct 2 stars for this omission.Recall that much of story of the American Revolution turns on Continental battles from Quebec to Georgia, the hit-and-run tactics of General Washington, the discussions of the far-flung Continental Congress, and the British naval tactics along the American coast. Unless you are familiar with the intricacies of North American geography (especially New Jersey, New York, and Virginia), you would do better to look elsewhere."
5,American history as it SHOULD be written,"This is the way history should be written. Bobrick's book gives the whole story of the American Revolution, from its origins through the war and the writing of the US Constitution. He weaves the words of the participants throughout the narrative, making a very readable account that is difficult to put down. Well researched, thoroughly annotated, and great bibliography."
3,Dry Retelling of the American Revolution,I found the book to be an excellent resource for straight facts but the writing style failed to hold my interest. Not enough time was spent on giving background of the major players in the revolution and some of the conclusions were suspect.I would recommend the book for a cursory overview of the American Revolution but believe that the books by John Ferling and Joseph Ellis are much more interesting.
3,works well but it's not rechargable as stated,I bought this as a birthday present for my girlfriend. While it works well it was advertised as cordless but it doesn't have a rechargable battery so you have to keep it plugged in. Other than that it does the job.
2,Still Under Review,"Still not sure about this item. We tried to use it by the pool for beach umbrella set-up. I didn't look at it closely until we were going home. The umbrella did not stand up well, but I noticed later that you needed to screw down the ""tabs"" to help hold in place. I would recommend staying with the regular ""heavy"" metal stands, as bad as I was trying to find something more convenient, easier to pack and cheaper. Sorry."
4,a day with your best friend,"Dog expressions are no so amazing as the cat ones, anyway the original 365 dogs calendar allows you to sit at your desk and have your best friend pet with you,"
5,wonderfully funny novels by a master of humor,"The three novels in this volume are three of the first four novels in P G Wodehouse's great Blandings Castle series (the other is Leave It to Psmith). Something Fresh isn't quite as good as Summer Lightning and Heavy Weather, because that memorable pig, the Empress of Blandings, has not yet appeared at the Castle. Heavy Weather takes place immediately after Summer Lightning, and the two are, in my opinion, two of Wodehouse's very best. Some of the great Wodehouse characters are here - the woolly-headed Ninth Earl of Emsworth, his sister, Lady Constance, and brother, The Honorable Galahad Threepwood, not to mention, among others, The Efficient Baxter. Not to be missed by anybody with a sense of humor."
1,"Poor, out of date course","I agree with Readzalot's review, and would recommend the publicly available and much more extensive Hausar Baka course (or other links from hausaonline.wordpress.com) if you want to learn Hausa."
1,zzzzzzzzzzzzz,"I have 2 children and often wonder in horror what it would be like to have one of them missng, which is why I didn't want to read this book. However, I did read it and found it terribly boring.I found Beth to be selfish and unloving. I had to skip words, pages.....but eventually, I finished it, only because I have a this notion of feeling compelled to finish any book I start. Of course everyone is different, but I would not recommend this book to anyone."
4,"Slow starter, but once you get into it, it is riveting.","It took a couple of tries to get into this book, but once I did I found the story to be very heartwrenching. The horror this family went through was something I wouldn't wish on my worst enemy. I, too, doubted Oprah the first time I tried to read the book, but then I tried again and I'm so glad I did. The story was a real tearjerker. I could totally feel the emotions that one must feel when a child is missing. It made me hold my own children a little closer and tighter."
3,"Fantastic book, but too long!","I thought this was a good book, and did a wonderous job ofexploring the psychological aspect of losing a child. However, I thought this could have been achieved in a lot fewer pages. This book was too long and I thought she could have gotten to the point alot faster"
3,Difficult but powerful,"I found this book to be a tough read. Nonetheless, I'm glad I made it through. True, Beth is largely unlikeable. But that doesn't make her uninteresting or unreal. I think the weaknesses of this book lie in the unexplored characters and in the lack of resolution regarding the kidnapper. However, the book is far from a failure. If you're willing to take on a novel that requires some thought, you might enjoy The Deep End of the Ocean."
1,Please don't waste your time reading this book!,"Wow, what a bad book. The writing was mediocre, and character development truly missing. Here are just a few of my frustrations with this book: Why were some chapters named (Beth, Reese, etc.) and some not? What was the point of that anyway? Why does the author think 7 year old children like opera? Why is she so interested in the way everybody smells? Why was Ben really kidnapped? Why didn't Pat leave Beth? Why, Why, Why was this book a best seller??"
1,A very depressing book to read,This book could leave anyone with feelings of total inadequacy and lack of control over anything in their life. So disappointing.
2,This is the best of the Oprah books...and it ain't good,"Yep, Beth, is cold, unlovable, and unlikable, which is the reason that reading the book is such a chore. If she would ever have made an attempt to help herself, to try to look outside of herself, the reader would be able to empathise. As it is, she is not a mother that anyone would like to have and I ended up feeling like the lost kid got the best end of the deal by getting out of the dysfunctional quagmire. I'm getting weary of the current literary obsession with victimization...give me a hero, and if not a hero, give me someone for whom I can at least feel compassion."
1,Extremely Disapointing,"I only kept reading this book thinking it has to get better, but unfortunately it never did. What amazes me is that I kept on reading it, for what I have no idea. There was nothing of redeeming value in the story or the characters, couldn't relate to any of them, and didn't even care to. It was a waste of time. There are very few books I can't get into, but this one was just bad and boring as hell"
2,"Lots of Potential, but...","This book could have had it all: exciting plot, twists and turns, deep emotion. But alas, it fell short. It was hard to follow and hard to get into."
1,I could never recommend this book........,"There was nothing in this book that I liked. The mother was a wholly unlikeable character. She had no regard for her other two children or her husband before the baby disappered. I must be obtuse because I could not figure out what the author's intent was. I do not enjoy reading a book that leaves me feeling so depressed at the end. I think I may never read another ""Oprah"" book again.Ree-views"
1,Exhaustive reading -- I was relieved to finish the book,"The Deep End of the Ocean started out with a bang -- the kidnapping of Ben, but went down hill from there. Once he was discovered, I felt page after page of monotony, and could have put the book down anytime. Spend your money on other books. R.STROUD U.S."
2,"And you thought Ben went into the ""deep end""???","I came to read this book because so many people told me how engrossing it was. I guess I somehow missed the boat. If the author's intent was to provoke, then she achieved her goal. I was enraged by Beth, the self-absorbed woman indentified as the missing child's mother. It seems as if she never wanted her children in the first place..just some pretty, well-behaved, charming things to show off when it didn't interfere with her ""woe, is me"" routine. This is evident in her neglect of the first born child, Vincent. I never once expected a happy ending to this drama..just some growth on Beth's part would have been satisfying and would have provided some hope that her remaining son would not be in jail within ten years. Tragedy shows us sides of people that we cannot imagine nor can we understand. It is hope that gives us the strength to try"
1,Horrible,"This book was horrible. I have to say I did not like Beth (mom) Vincent (big Bro) or Ben ( lil bro).I think the mom is selfish, but I completly understand how when her child is kid napped she becomes a recluse and doesnt wanna see anyone not even her other children. She does some things in the book that I do not like when she gets her son back. No one would do that unless they like feeling sad.I hate The older son, it was his fault that the younger brother was kid napped, at the beginning he always looked at his mom like he hated her. Towards the end I liked him better bc i felt bad for him.I hated Ben, he didnt even think any bad thoughts towards the kidnappers. He said it was no thier faults, that made me sooo mad.I did like the dad Pat.He was always by his wifes side, and his kids. He was the best character.This book is not worth reading. The ending left you wondering what happened to the characters. I am annoyed after reading that."
3,Don't believe the hype,"It was saved from yawnsville with its twist, but pull outthe No-Doz for the entirely predictable finale. I applaudOprah's motives with her on-air ""book club"" (and, I mustadmit, I had already read Song of Solomon and The Book ofRuth, but the publicity surrounding Oprah put me on tothis one) but the novel was no more than a mildly entertainingbeach read and was quite disappointing"
1,This was a depressing journey with no way out.,"I couldn't wait to finish this book. It drug me deep into a depression hole with no light. The mother had few redeeming qualities and didn't do anything for her other children. If she loved her lost son so much, why didn't she support her remaining children. I thought the plot was too simplistic...how many missing children are kidnapped by an old schoolmate? Most are killed or never found. I would have liked to see a triumph for the mother over this horrible experience but she disappointed me. Why read a book that's filled with no hope?"
2,I hate how the mother just gave up on her family,Some parts were ok but there is no use for the swearing or for Beth acting the way she does towards her family I understand the agony of losing a child but you just cant give up on the whole family like she did.
2,Reading this book took much effort,"No doubt, J. Mitchard has lots of literary talent, but she didn't do herself any favors with this book. The unending psychological battles and personal profiles of the lead character (Beth) overshadowed an otherwise decent storyline. And of course, the author also related unnecessary psycho-babbles about every character Beth ever came in contact with. And the ending (was there really one?) could have left us with more.EW"
3,One long drag....until the end!,"Oprah, what were you thinking when you said that this book was, just outstanding! The only reason I decided to keep reading, was to find out what would happen to Ben. After I found out, I sunk into the ""Deep End of the Ocean."" When I finally got to the end, my eyes opened and I woke up from my slumber. I would not recommend that people waste their time reading this drowning book, that would sink the Titanic."
5,Heartbreaking,"The Deep End of the Ocean is a heartbreaking book about a family and how they cope with the disappearance of their little boy. Each member of the family reacts in a different way and the author does a great job with each ones emotions. I highly enjoyed the book, but thought the movie could have been so much better. I recommend the book, but not the movie."
2,A struggle ...,"I had to struggle to get through this book. The whole time I was reading the book, I thought ""This can't possibly be the final draft!"" It felt slightly disjointed as though the connecting tendons were missing. The story line was good and the premise was good, but the characters were rather unlikeable. The most interesting/likeable character was Vincent/Reese.The story jumped from place to place/year to year in such a manner that I constantly realized that I was reading. The next Mitchard book I read (if I read another) will be from the library!"
3,As superficial as they come.,An airplane book. The kind you read when you have to sit on an airplane for 4 hours and don't have to think
3,"Why is everyone going of the ""deep end"" for DEEP END?","I agree with Glee, a previous reviewer who was not impressed by ""The Deep End of the Ocean"". Just finished reading the book having succumbed to newspaper reviews of Oprah's Book Club and her book selections. This one is OK, but not GREAT! I hope ""Song of Solomon"" and ""The Book of Ruth"" are much better"
3,"Not bad, ending a little unbelievable.",The book moved pretty fast through the story. I think it would of been a little more interesting if the author dwelled into the history more of the abductor.The ending was a little dissappointing
3,Disappointing,I read it only because of Oprah--I would never have picked this book up on my own. Did Mithcard write this with movie-made-for-television in mind? Beth was so unlikeable and the other characters were underdeveloped.
2,Not Good.,"It's intriguing and compelling, but it's not good. A good book affects you, changes you, and empathizes with you. This one did none of that for me. Curiosity compelled me to finish it out, but it was pointlessly depressing."
1,Don't read this book!!!,"What a totally unrealistic, boring, and dumb book. The premise was great (son is kidnapped, family learns how to deal with it); but let's get real. At some point, why didn't somebody tell Beth to quit whining and point out to her what she is doing to her other two kids. Her husband, her friends, relatives, anybody! But no, they just tip-i-toed around her, treating her like a fragile piece of china. Break, already! On top of that, the book was boring, difficult to understand, had characters nobody could relate to. I am never, never going to read another book Oprah recommends again. On the contrary, if I see one of her ""books"", I'm going to run screaming out the door. What a waste of my time and money!!!"
2,So-so,"I think that there were good and bad points about The Deep End of The Ocean. Some of the characters were outstanding, others were cardboard cut-outs. Some parts of the plot were inventive, some were predictable. Some of the writing was very good, and some was not so good. I would have enjoyed this book much more if I had been let more into the mind of Ben/Sam and less into Vincent/Reese, and more into what actually happens to the family. Vincent/Reese seemed like a way to kill time until another plot development could be made. I would reccommend The Deep End of the Ocean to anybody looking for a quick, but not entirely profound read."
3,taxiing down the runway....... still taxiing down the runway,"I really like these guys...I would have given it a higher rating if there had been more strong points throughout the cd, but they are too few and far between. It's as if Hum is taxiing down the runway, but just can't seem to get enough lift to take-off. I got the same feeling from their previous release, ""You'd Prefer an Astronaut"" (B000002WSX). The only song on ""Downward Is Heavenward"" that really stands out to me is track #6, ""Green to Me"". I really like the way that song kicks in. The rest of the cd ranges from mediocre to almost good. I must agree with some of the other reviewers who compliment Hum's ability to create heavy melodies. I would like to hear how Hum would have honed their creative and technical abilities over the years had they not disbanded (so I am told).Bottom line... Hum presents a fresh sound with much room for improvement."
4,Good for Hum fans,"Lots of great songs, though it doesn't have the same continuity of the first one. Still a must for Hum fans."
2,Average,"But not for me. Too generic, too noisy, too much not a step up from their previous album (which needed it). The production is brickwalled along with most late nineties albums, and none of the songwriting goes any way toward being as appreciable as the catchy hooks from their previous album. In fact, not one song on this album is memorable. Compare that with the 3:1 hit:miss ratio of You'd prefer an astronaut and you have a loser of an album.Add to that the fact that none of the member have gone any distance toward improving their playing (bar the drummer) - the guitars still sound sloppy, the singer still flat and monotonal. And that was fine with the simplistic melodies and hooks on Atronaut - but here in the midst of attempted complex rhythms and harmonies, it just doesn't quite get there. Good luck guys on your future."
5,Opening the doors for melodic death metal...,"""Always"" was an album truly before its time.Released in 1993, almost 10 years ago, this album is truly a predecessor for today's melodic death/doom metal.Incorporating deep, dreary growling and occasional female vocals with keyboards, flutes, windchimes, and even a grand piano The Gathering truly produced a melodic metal masterpiece with ""Always"".Not nearly as hard as metal contemporary Amorphis' release ""Karelian Isthmus,"" ""Always"" makes up for it with beautiful acoustical work and symphonic keyboard interludes... all the while never losing its distinct metal edge.With the exception of two tracks, all songs on this album are over 6 minutes long, which provides the listener with plenty of melodic instrumental work and dynamic death/doom vocals. If you're into the newer releases of Tiamat, Lacuna Coil, Therion and the like, you'll be more than pleased with this early work of The Gathering."
4,"JANE DELIVERS, BUT NOT IN TOP FORM","The second of the Jane Austen mysteries, while a good read and a highly satisfying tale, lacks the ability to keep the readers on their toes throughout the entirety of the book that the third and first posses. The plot was something I was unsatisfied with--finding it hard to get involved with the star's new acquaintences, particularly Geoffery Sidmouth. Sidnouth's volatile character became annoying after a time, and there were places in the plot that were rather flat. This book serves as an appetizer to the fabulous feast of a tale that follows it."
5,Takes the guess work out of aquatic plant dosing!,"This stuff is phenomenal!!! Honestly, it is rather expensive for fertilizer water. However, it's foolproof. It's dang near impossible to overdose. I used to dry dose and would overdose all the time. Now with this stuff, my plants and tank are a lot more stable. I trust the Seachem brand. I have all their products. Will buy again."
2,These kinda sucked!,"Bought these to replace the factory heads on hubby's drums. Considering all he AND the rest of the guys in the band did was complain about them (sound, fit, durability) I have to say I'll NEVER buy these again. Oh, and the bass head broke the first time they played out with them. Thumbs down!"
5,Unbelievable,"Okay, I'm not into poetry, but this book is one of my favorite books ever. Lots of different voices, so there is will be someone who will put to words your experience. But the most interesting poems are the ones where the author is coming from different space and the messages still cut through. No cliches here."
5,Awesome ska album,This is Bomb The Music Industry's best album yet! More rocking and more ska! This is an album to own!
5,Make More Music,"Rome was one of the hottest, overlooked artists in the 90s! This cd has some of the hottest tracks!This is when music was music and artists put their all to please their fans!"
2,disappointed,"i've had other thai pavilion products that were good.. this one isn't. it doesn't make alot unless you add stuff the sause smells so bad it almost made me throw up, and to top it off it had no kick in it like most thai food. the price wouldn't be bad if if was good but its not its a waste of money specialy at about 2.90 a box"
3,Kind of boring for Thai Food,"The package says that it serves 1-2, but unless you add some meat and vegetables it will only serve 1. I made it with some chicken and snow peas and it was ok, but it was nothing like real Thai food, which is bursting with flavors. It's also not very peanutty in flavor. Next time I make it, I will try to add some peanut butter to the sauce or ground peanuts to top it off. Note to those not familiar with Thai food: when you open the sauce packet, the fish sauce smell is quite strong. Don't worry, it's not strong whne everything is all mixed together. One final comment, I don't think the product is worth the money, even when it is on sale."
3,with a little tinkering....,"My first experiences with this holder were bad, it wouldn't securely hold the crayon.But by building up the dull end of a crayon with a few wraps of masking tape before inserting it I found it to be plently useful, both as a handle and at preventing crayon breakage.I'm thinking about shortening the holder about an inch, just to decrease toolbelt or pocket bulk."
1,Cheap crop,I whip my sub with it and it unraveled this is a cheap item.I was very unhappy also with the so called leather they used to make it hard and cheap.
2,Prop NOT Crop,"this item was cheap, and good thing cuz the quality is garbage. I suppose it would work as a costume prop, but you get what you pay for I suppose."
3,"Heavy, but..........","In comparison to Fear Of God's earlier release, Within The Veil, I found Toxic Voodoo to be just an average release. It is a very heavy release musically, but something seems to be missing. This may possibly be because other than vocalist Dawn Crosby, this is an entirely differnt band. I don't feel they have the same chemistry the original band member's had.The other problem I found was in Dawn's vocals. Althogh she had some verey raspy vocals on their first release, she also had some very clear parts to the cd. The way everything was arranged between the two different vocal styles resulted in a tremendous sound for the finishe product. On this release the clearer sounding vocals are very, very few to say the least,while the harsher sound is far more prelavent. Without the mix It just dose'nt work as well.This one may work for those who enjoy the sound of todays raspy sounding bands, but for me It was a huge let down from the earlier material."
5,AS GOOD AS IT GETS,"This is heavy/power metal at its best. Along with their earlier recordings this is all that a true metalfan needs. Great songs, great vocals, great guitarwork, great...you get the picture. I've listened to them (Helloween) since they released ""Walls of Jericho"" in -85 and I NEVER get tired of hearing them, and I doubt you will. The two parts were planned to be released as a doublealbum but the recordcompany said no, but here it is as it was planned from the beginning."
4,A thoughtful textbook,"A very neutral, but complete, review of the old testament.I can't imagine anyone objecting to anything in this book - and it does make you think as you actually read the Bible. Actually reading the Bible itself is one of the key points.On the other hand, its strength is also its weakness. Don't expect much non-orthodox material here."
1,What a dissapointment,"This camera appeared to be the perfect one for what I needed; an easy to use camera with a zoom. The day after I received it I used the zoom and it retracted one time. The next time it would not retract and the zoom is completely jammed. This in itself is not so bad, annoying and inconvenient yes, but not a total disaster. There is probably a simple fix for this. I thought I could just call the manufacturer and get some help. Fat chance of that! They do not even give a phone number for customer service. I had to send an email and was told I would get a reply in writing within 3 days. I just got a reply (a form email letter)that tells me to ship the camera back to them at my expense. Next time I will research the customer service as well as the item I purchase."
5,A MUST FOR ANY SERIOUS CANDIDATE!!!,"If you are SERIOUS about getting an appointment at the Naval Academy, this book should definately be on your shelf. It explains the applications processes to the grueling plebe year to the difficult academic years through interviews with midshipmen themselves and also with teachers at the Academy, Congressional aides, and graduates. This book tells you the Do's and Don'ts of plebe year and honestly addresses the ""academic shock"" most mids experience thier first year of classes. As a serious person trying to get an appointment in 2003, I can say this is one of THE most info packed books on preparing, getting in, and surviving."
2,I own this. Bleh. Wish it was better.,"The sound on this collection is extremely muddy. Bleh. I just picked up Best of John Denver which is a Madacy budget collection of rerecordings of some of JD's best known songs. Although they are not the original recordings, they are crisp and clean and JD's voice soars and sparkles, along with a well produced mix of all the instruments.I'd recommend checking out other collections, perhaps the Rocky Mtn Collection or Reflections:Songs Of Love & Life. Note: I have no idea how the sound is on these.I can tell you that the sound on the Sony disk - The Best of John Denver Live is great. It is a live disk and it is from much later in JD's career, but boy does he infuse these performances with everything he's got."
5,Left Us Way To Soon,"Hi, Love John Denver & His Beautiful Music,And listening to these,ALWAYS MAKES ME CRY,Good Job,Thank's John,I had to buy these because I almost have wore out my 8-Track.Thank's Stormy"
5,A gentle progression from 25 years of music-,"If John Denver's original music and his presentation blow you away, then so will this compilation. If you're even remotely entertained by John Denver's artistry, the same goes - - you'll thoroughly enjoy this collection, spanning as it does the earliest years to the late 80s. You might be surprised by the mixes on the earliest songs... Denver re-recorded them for the Greatest Hits album of 1974. The selections blend gently with each other and reflect all the published sides of this artist (whom I personally miss). The hits are here, the secondary efforts are here... even a couple of obscure items are here. Hope you enjoy it as much as I."
1,It just doesn't sound right,"The remixing is so bad , THAT IT GETS ON MY NERVES. WHY DO THEY RUIN AN ARTIST MUSIC LIKE THAT? I WISH I HAD NEVER BOUGHT IT."
4,Divine even without Divine,"At the time of its release, this was easily John Waters's most technically accomplished and professional-looking film. It's sort of a step or two away from his infamous trash aesthetic in that respect. The Baltimore maestro's first feature without Divine is also his strangest, basically a demented, surreal fairy tale, replete with colorful cardboard sets and colorful cardboard characters. Quite funny in places and highly original, I'd count this among his best films."
5,Without a doubt the single most depraved film ever made!,"This film has a take no prisoners approach and stops at nothing. Just when you think John Waters cannot be more depraved, he goes one step beyond. It was AWESOME! This film is one of the few Waters films that does not feature Divine. As wonderful as she was, it might be a blessing because the other JW stars (Mink, Edith, et al)can really shine on their own. AND THEY DO! Buy it, see it, see it again and love it. It's perhaps Camp at its highest level!"
2,Interesting from the historical perspective,"I picked this up on sale and thought it would be interesting, which it was. What it was not was a heartfelt performance by the greatest American rocker of them all. I wish it sounded like Elvis cares about the rock & roll songs here, but it doesn't. He's putting on a show -- not as a singer but as a STAR.You can't fault the band -- It great to hear so many top-quality musicians on stage. You will never hear a tighter group. It is cool that he merely tells the band the name of the song and they immediately dive in, tight as a drum.But Elvis seems only interested in the country songs along with Reconsider Baby and the American Trilogy. The rest of the time he's phoning it in. This is nothing like the Comeback Special where Elvis put it all on the line."
5,the perfect cracker,"""Raw"" or heated, plain or laden with cheese, ham, turkey, singly or stacked in twos or threes - this pure wholewheat manna is as the staff of life's supposed to be: delicious and healthy. Period."
2,I this really the Stones?,This is a very cheezy cd of the stones. I just saw imatators last night that did a better job!
2,Some things should be left alone - by an old geezer,"Imagine my excitement at seeing the second cd in this set, who cannot love Rocks Off - I only get my rocks off while I'm dreaming - or Monkey Man? However our boys are getting old, and while time is on my side it is not on the side of Michael Philip. I was disappointed in this as it lacked the vitality of earlier live albums such as Stripped, Get your Ya-Yas out and Still Life, Got live if you want it. Unless you really need this album then burn a few songs off their earlier live albums and have your own compilation.Sorry Keef, but it's time to hang it up. The memories are great. By the way, here's a puzzler, which one of the stones is bald? WHen have you ever seen 5 men in their 60's all with full heads of hair - I'm betting Mick and Ronnie."
1,Pool cover was very flimsy!!!,It was a glorified round tarp!!! I was very disappointed in the material and durability of this product.
4,Very effective,"I am always going to stock this in my house!I use it on a couple different kinds of infection I seem to get, and every time it has been effective in helping get rid of them!I also use essential oils in combination with this."
5,Bone density supplement,"I started taking this supplement after reading research results that look promising to improve bone density. Too early to tell if it does me any good, but hopeful!"
2,One Redeeming Feature,"This album is comprised mostly of forgettable alternative pop. There is, however, one gem to be found on this album. The song entitled, 'Red.' It's a fairly soft song, and quite different from the rest of the album. It's low energy, but very nice in it's simplicity. It has a lead guitar solo which is short, straightforward, but soothing. 'Red' was accompanied by a video that aired on Much Music around the time of the album's release. I don't recommend purchasing the album, but give the song a listen if you have an opportunity."
3,"Not strips, they're nuggets","These are in no way 'strips', they're actually medium size nuggets which are not even chewy but more like biscuits. My Golden does love them, hence the 3 stars, but the name is extremely deceptive."
1,Threw them out,"This is an easy review because the judgement was made by our two papillons. They live for their treats and are NOT especially picky about treats. These items are dried, uniform in size, and although they may be ""organic"" they smell bad and my dogs would have nothing to do with them. I threw them out and wanted to share the expensive experience with others so they would not waste their money."
5,Have I tried these myself? No...,"...but the way my dogs almost take my hands off when I offer these to them says it all. They like these. They REALLY like these. (I know, dogs will eat anything, but mine are a little fussy. They are INSANE about these.)"
4,Floppy loves it,"My beagle loves this treat.The texture is like a cookie and is kind of perfect treat to break into pieces, stuff it in a kong toy etc."
3,decent,"Lets make this clear: This is NOT Dry Kill Logic, who's previous name was Hinge. The only albums they have released under the Hinge moniker are ""Cause Moshing is Good Fun"" and ""Elemental Evil."" So anyone who claims this is Dry Kill Logic are full of you-know-what. That being said however, this album is not half bad...just don't go expecting Dry Kill Logic/Hinge. It's more of a stoner-metal slow grooving type of album, so if that is your thing as well, download a couple tracks and if you like what you hear...then by all means, buy it."
5,get this and everything by DKL,"hinge ruled, they are now known as Dry Kill Logic, who rule the most. also check out 40 below summer, because they rule just as much and have some similar styles. peace out \m/"
3,Theory great - practise bad,"Very clear written book about the power of CSS. Every feature is explained in detail. So this would be the one and only book about CSS - if only the browsers would comply to the standard! The indications which browser supports which feature are far to superficial to be a guideline for the practitioner. So the book is ahead of his time. Hopefully, in the third edition this book will meet compliant browsers and Addison-Wesley will get rid of the editorial errors which are indeed ironic (see first review)."
2,don't waste your time - most features can't be implemented,"This would be a great book if it discussed more than the W3C specifications, most of which are not implemented properly by today's browsers. If you are serious about learning CSS, you need to understand browser implementations, and practical uses of the CSS spec. For example, the discussion on CSS-Positioning leads one to believe that this will replace HTML table alignment. It gives no indication to the usefullness of CSS-P to DHTML and such effects like drop-down menus.If you want to learn CSS, there are many online resources. Also, a great product called TopStyle has built in code validation that clearly reveals browser implementation issues...it can't be beat."
3,The People Magazine of the Underworld,"The author's ability to provide entertaining biographies and descriptive details of the underworld makes this a quick read. Useful for an overview, or a great book for those newly interested in the mafia. Unfortunately the sensationalism and matter-of-fact delivery that makes this book so easy to read is its downfall. Those who are somewhat versed in this topic will find themselves questioning details, or exclaiming: ""Yes, but that's just part of the story."" Still - I would recommend it as a starting point."
4,one of the best,"out of all the mob encyclopedia's out there;one of the earliest and best.loved it!of course,the book was written in '87,so you won't get any more up to date info but the man doesn't have a crystal ball."
5,A great way to get them writing~,"My teenage son does not like writing... anything! I bought this since he started a secret club with a few friends, and he used it to draft their bylaws. He has practiced writing to make sure the final product looks professional. Got him to write!"
5,Great set for the casual fan,"This disc, along with the other new DS DVD, are definately a must have if you are a casual fan of the show. For those of us with the complete collection already on DVD, there is nothing really new of interest. There is a nice NEW interview of David Selby, but it only runs a few minutes and leaves you wondering what happened to the rest of the interview. Just when you are getting into the interview, it chops off and ends. I guess they will be using the rest of it for some other re-issue down the road. There is also a funny 20 second PBS spot by Selby. Also included a a complete episode from the show. I would have left that off and included more of the interview, at least this way there could have been more new content on the disc. For the common fan who has not purchased all 20+ box sets, this is a good disc to get, but for those of us who regularly watch the episodes already on DVD, this disc will probably sit on a shelf collecting dust after the first viewing."
3,i'm 30,"This game was kool in the arcade, I always stuck in a few tokens. Getting it home was cool too. Its fast paced and the levels are too short, unlike raiden which is well paced and longer. It seems to have a better smart bomb than the aracde did and the graphics are generally kool for a shooter. Its a great shooter if you are a fan, its way better than philsoma, what a let down that was, not as good as r-type or raiden, but offers 2 player shooter action unlike r-types, you can play it with your girlfriend (always a plus) so buy it if you are a shooter fan, otherwise go wow yourself with some over produced rpg."
2,Post Tenebras Lux,"I don't have a lot to say here except that based on the author's reputation I was expecting a much more interesting book. Truthfully I was bored and finished Jupiter by sheer power of will. The book never took off or found its footing and the payoff was not worth the effort of investing a few hours in this story. There were a few good moments here and there when it came to its descriptions of Jupiter, the titular planet that is ""stranger than we can imagine"" but overall this novel was a lot like a car without an engine."
2,Boring,"It seemed to be populated by characters I did not care for doing things I found unlikely, such as being only wounded when the submarine springs a leak while crusing in the ocean of Jupiter.It went into the trade-in pile after 150 pages."
4,"I'd give it 4 1/2, its a top notch Novel","I have not red a great deal of Ben Bova's work; only this and Venus. Yet if the rest of his work is like this, I shall become a fan of his real quick. Bova writes an interesting plot line with realistic science facts, very interesting characters and some interesting messages on morality which is a big part of the story line. I recommend this to anyone"
2,Pedestrian,"This is a first contact novel with a religous dimension. The protagonist is an ernest, actually bland, graduate student detailed to become a spy on a research station orbiting Jupiter. He is supposed to be spying for religous organizations who have come to dominate the politics of most of Earth. These groups are threatened by the discovery of new life forms within the Jovian system and immensely concerned by the possibility that intelligent life will be discovered on Jupiter itself. This is a good foundation for a book; a possibility to explore the relationship of science and religion as well as individual dilemmas of conscience. Instead, this is a conventional adventure story with pedestrian writing. A real lost opportunity. Readers interested in religion and the issues raised by first contact would do well to find a copy of James Blish's A Case of Conscience. This outstanding book, published over 40 years ago, has a similar point of departure, but is immensely superior to Jupiter."
1,no worthy of the 1 star,"infester is talking rubbish, this shows how much he knows of true death metal,"
3,ehh,Been using this product with the seachem flourish for a few weeks now but don't really notice a big change in my plants. This product was poorly packaged and one of the bottle was leaking when I opened it. I sent pictures to amazon and they didnt do anything about so be aware of this when your buying.
4,Glenn Frey,"As one of the original Eagles, Glenn steps out on his own to produce an excellent album. If you like the Eagles, this is a good album."
3,Good dance CD but it embarrassed me. Didn't buy from Amazon,"I got this from the local store. It didn't have any warning so I thought it was safe to buy, just wanted some fast pace music. I was in the car with some friend and put it on and there was one track on each CD with cursing all through it. Everyone was like turn that off. I thougth CDs where suppose to have warnings about exlicit content. With movies you kind of know what you are buying but with music you don't and then are disappointed. It makes me not want to buy music. If would be nice if we could pick the music we want on a CD and create our own. Maybe that could be a new Amazon feature product - buy your own music and download to a CD. I would have given this 5 stars I enjoyed the beat but made it 3 because there was no warning about the bad language and the embarrassment it cause me."
5,great collection,the Dream Shake. Hakeem Olajuwon was one of the Greatest NBA Players Ever. he was a scary versatile Center who covered so much ground and gave other players fits with his ability. he was strong and very quick. this Collection captures him in his Prime. He was something else.
1,horrible false things,never ever will you encounter an office like mentioned in this. a insidious plot to ruin business as we know.
1,Not worth the money,"I recently was a woman promoted to a fairly high position in my corporation. I purchased this book thinking it would give me helpful tips to surviving up at the top. It turned out that it was full of ""catty"" comments and really should be viewed as nothing more than entertainment; not as a useful business tool."
1,No principles & no principles,"If you're style is to lie, cheat and steal, this is your guide. If you're subtle (e.g., lie by omission, cheat by being unfair), you'll find a kindred spirit in the authors. This is a book for the unprincipled.And, as valuable as office politics is (and there I agree with the author...just not her style), this book will offer you no principles for understanding it or playing the Office Game. What you'll get are cleverly written anecdotes of how Ronna one-upped somebody, or stories she relates (or made up; given her principles, I'd suspect the latter) that happened to others.Finally, the book shows a grinning author seated at the head of the conference table...all alone. How appropriate!"
4,Career Self-Defense Manual Should Be Required Reading,"As a tragically flawed 'nice guy' who finished last in the corporate career sweepstakes, I wish that this book had been part of the core curriculum during my college education. Now a 'consultant' who must beg for work from the truly undeserving, I learned the hard way that it is neither talent nor training that matter so much as tactics and technique. In fact, if there is one criticism of this well-written book, it is that Ms. Lichtenberg is too prone to counsel compromise instead of confrontation for the 'take no prisoners' trench warfare that seems to preoccupy the corporate workplace. However, there is much to recommend this volume, particularly the author's wide range of relevant war-stories. Give it to a college graduate that you love."
3,Something from Nothing,"Helloween's High Live was recorded back in 1996 during the Time of the Oath tour. This isn't a bad recording. The performances are good, But their a little inconsistant. i think the problem here was the mixing was a little off. For instance the intro to We Burn the music fades in and out a little and it's a little Sporatic until half way through the song where it finally balances out. Most of these selections are taken from the Master of the Rings and the Time of the Oath Albums. The real shining moment on the 2 Album set is the vocal performance of Andi Deris. And that is the only reason that i am half heartedly reccomending this Album. But if you want a real solid live Album with great performance and proficiency. The live in Sao Paulo is a much better live Album than this one."
5,Man Inside Woman,"I've always been fascinated by the challenge of a male author writing from inside the head of a woman. I've wanted to read a work that faithfully holds true to the femeinine thinking mystique.Nick Hornby has done something new. Instead of dramatizing the gender conflicts, he has used them merely as a backdrop to tell a riveting and very human story of one flawed woman's confrontation with herself and human nature.This reminds me of another great book,HILLARY, in that it develops the full complexity and subtlety of conflicted human nature... and does it without the too cute British Island boy plunk.Out of this character study, he develops complex themes about human nature, loyalty, betrayal, and relationships.I haven't read a more literary creation in quite some time.TryUpland Road,GODLESSandWanderlost,The Progress Of Manfor further reading."
2,It is so boring...,"The novel ""High Fidelity"" written by Nick Hronby is about a man called Rob Fleming, woh wants to meet all his ex-girlfriends and wants to ask them, why they left him. All this he does because Laura, his last girlfriend left him because of an other man. Now he asks himself, what he did wrong in all his relationships.I think the novel is not really good, because the story is not very realistic. The protagonist Rob Fleming is a childish and inmature man, who's only interest is how good his sex-life is. I think the story is not realistic. And all that makes the book unreal and stupid."
5,refreshing,One of the best books I read in the last years.The first book where men feelings are clearly explained without cheap sicology or philosophical presumptions.In addition Hornby has a very personal and refreshing style.Has to be read.
4,Hornby at his best,"I thought this book was a great read. Entertaining, fast-paced, insightful. It's basically the story of a not completely likable guy, who has just gone through a bad breakup, and is going back to see the five girls he considers to have been his worst breakups to figure out what's wrong with him. Funny stuff happens. Even some sappy stuff, which was tolerable. I liked the movie a lot when I saw it years ago, but when I watched it after reading the book, it wasn't as good."
2,Normal boring book,"My opinion on High Fidelity by Nick hornby is that the novel is funny but many passages are a little bit boring because sometimes it's the same content on every page in a chapter. But if you see the film , you will say that the film is better than the novel, cuz the actors are very ood and funny...Bo-email"
1,Fantastic story but the kindle version of this book is terrible,"The kindle version of this book is littered with errors. I am almost convinced that they used a free image-to-text converter and then didn't bother to go through after to check for mistakes.Don't get me wrong. This is a great story and a really funny read. This one star review is for the poorly edited kindle version of this book, which is infuriatingly bad."
4,Enjoyable Read,Plenty of laughs and a nice pace. Enjoyed this one quite a bit. Will consider reading other of his books.
3,"Somewhat Over-rated, but still good","Though it failed to live up to it's reputation of being hilarious, it was still good enough of a book to trigger me to buy Hornbys other work (I recomend ""How To Be Good""). I frequently found myself angered by the main character, or just depressed for him. Perhaps his self-hatred and over-philosophising (sorry, I'm sure I spelled that wrong) is intended to be funny, but I'm not one to laugh at someone's pain (unless it's someone getting hit in the groin. Love that gag!). So, I'm actually not sure why I liked this book as much as I did, but I'm not afraid of the unexplained."
4,Loved The Beginning...,"I absolutely loved the beginning of this book! It sucked me in right away and didn't let up for the whole first part. However, though I thoroughly enjoyed the book as a whole, the second part of the book didn't have quite the same appeal for me that the first part did.I really enjoyed Rob's (the main character's) perspective on relationships and life in general. He's quite insecure in many ways, but it's easy to relate to his thoughts and feelings, especially when he puts such a humorous twist on things. I really loved reading about the dynamic of the record shop and his employees. The guys he works with are just classic characters, the type of guys you feel like you know.The ending was a little cheesy for my taste, but overall I really enjoyed the book and I'm planning to read Hornby's other novels. There are so many others to choose from, I don't know where to start!"
5,Like a woman trapped in a man's body,"but not in the gross sense of the word. For all the ""chick lit"" books out there, this novel really gives insight into what men think of when dealing with relationships. There is so much going on in there; all his insecurities and all the details he remembers about each girl or each situation. Who says men don't remember? The movie captures the endless questioning and inner struggle perfectly, never mind that John Cusack was the perfect person to play the main charecter ""Rob"", given Cusack's film history of getting dumped and never getting the girl, etc.This book is a must read for anyone, man or woman, who would like to comically explore the ins and outs of other people's relationships."
5,"A very funny, realistic and accurate porayal of men","I found this book was the best I have read in six months. It had all the familiarity that makes a book closer to home. I enjoyed reminiscing as the book went nostalgic and sympathised with Rob (the protagonist) as he went through his trials. The book was gripping, and I read it in 2 nights."
2,The greatest book on earth by far,"Ok, High Fidelity is a quite funny book. But who cares about the life of a midage loser called Rob, who lives in a small flat in a underpriviliged area of London. Do the problems of him really matter to me? I don't think so....but if you are in your midlife crises and you haven't enough problems by yourself, you should read this novel to get aware of Rob's sad life. May be you can relate with him. But if you are a younger person it is hard to beliefe in the things which are explained by Nick Hornby. Finally a little hint. If you are still interested in the story you should watch the movie!"
2,High Fidelity went a bit too long.,"High Fidelity started out telling the story of a young man and his two friends that all worked together in a record shop that the main character owned. They were men but sounded more like overgrown teenagers. They thought they all wanted to meet the right woman but when any woman entered their lives they immediately wondered what they might be missing out on. None of the characters had done much growing by the end and quite frankly it all got pretty boring and I was rushing for the ending. You get a feeling that the author really has a talent for writing but hasn't quite reached his potential. I had planned on giving this book three stars but that seemed a bit much. I read this book because I had previously read "" How To Be Good"" and I wouldn't recommmend either."
3,Just like the movie,"If you are like me, you somtimes hate the way directors take a story and mutilate it with their own version of a script. I watched High Fidelity, the movie before I read the book, but half way through I realized that it is the exact same as the movie. My recomendation is to save the time laboring over the British slang in the book and watch the movie which is an Americanized version of the same thing."
1,Boring,"In conclusion I can say that Nick Hornby`s book is not the type of book I like to read. In the book there are too many moods and thoughts and nothing really happens. You could take out half of the pages and you would not have problems to understand the book. The only really funny person in the book is Barry. He made me laugh one or two times when he made jokes about people who came into the shop. The funniest scene in the book is when Ian calls Rob and Rob thinks about some possibilities what he could say to Ian. I think that this book is for women because it has no plot but lots of ""grease"", thoughts and moods as in Titanic. I would say to every man who wants to read the book: ""Leave it""."
2,Not fascinating,The book tells the story about a 35-year old man called Rob. He has his own record shop and many problems with girls and women. His girlfriend Laura left him and now he wants to sort out his old relationships. He calls five girls he once loved to know why they split up. Every woman reacts in a different way.His friends are Barry and Dick who help him in his record shop although there is not much work. Barry is a mess and Dick is very shy.Most of the time the book is easy to read and sometimes even easy to understand. The language reflects Rob's chaotic way of life. There are many trains of thoughts in brackets in some chapters. I would give 2 stars to the book because the book is not fascinating and in many chapters boring because there is no real plot.
2,An OK Read... read Stephen Fry or Hugh Laurie for laughs,"I was stranded in an airport in Managua, desperately fighting ennui... this book only added to it. After reading other readers' reviews in Amazon, I bought it. MISTAKE! The dialogue was witty and sharp at times, but most of the time the reader does not develop any empathy with the main character, Rob. The entire book seemed like an exercise in self-absorption and veered into whining a tad much. The only question remains after reading this book is why in the world would any woman snog/shag/etc this self-centered, egotistical, whinny little man-boy? (other than the law of averages, as one of the more bearable parts of the book points out)."
3,record store maven,maybe its because i read this book in 2003 and it was written in 1995 when the references to different bands just doesnt hold up as much anymore or maybe its that i saw the movie first and the movie takes place in america but i didnt feel this book carries the stigma of being as great as i heard it was. i felt it dragging too much
3,above average,"It took a lot longer for the book to come than I had planned, and it came in a manila folder with no padding. It wasn't damaged, however, and the pages were intact. I would probably buy books from a different seller next time."
3,decent but overrated,This book was alright. rob was a self-absorbed self-obsessed drip. his musings took up waay too many pages. the record store scenes with his two underlings were the funniest part of the novel. i thought i was gonna die when Barry tells off the old geezer looking for stevie wonder's 'I just called to say I love you' . Or when Barry joins a band called Barrytown in part because his name coincided with the groups. Barry was the funniest bloke in this book If they had more of the funny record store scenes and less coverage of Rob's woman troubles this would have been a great book
3,Good writing about nothing.,"This is one of the best written books about nothing I have ever read. The protagonist isn't even waiting for Godot and still manages to make time pass by being totally self-absorbed. This is not a book about men. It is about arrested development, and it's very funny."
3,Thoughtful and Philosophical,"High Fidelity is a 1990s male story of life and popular culture. The narrative is full of dialogue and contemplation that is steered around a mid-life-mid-life crisis. One of the strongest aspects of this story is the philosophy that is provided regarding relationships, which is presented as plausible and often easy to relate to. At times I did find it tiring to read this book as it is quite heavy with detail. However, the story contains a steady supply of interesting situations and descriptions.Nicholas R.W. Henning - Australian Author"
5,The Bible for Thirtysomethings,"The warning from the Details'Review in the back of this amazingly funny and touching piece of literature is right: keep this book away from your girlfriend... Then again, it might be a very good idea to just let her read it, even study it, so she can understand you better or leave you right away, before the love you think you share becomes yesterday's one hit wonder.I wish I knew the right words to convince you to pick up this book. I wish I could tell you why its so great without giving away anything. If the movie (I haven't seen it) is half as good as the novel, I'm probably gonna see it once or twice, with ex or current girlfriends at my side.My top five ""Generation Books"" of all time: Palahniuk's ""Fight Club"",""A Clockwork Orange"" by Burgess, ""Trainspotting"" by Welsh, ""Life After God"" from Coupland, and of course this one."
3,Dvd vs Laserdisc,I just acquired the laserdisc of this & the color is beautiful. The laserdisc was released in 1993. I know it is uncut just like the Tom & Jerry box sets were taken from the masters unedited. Someone had a post on Pusscat being cut so tell me what was cut! Im not that familar with this movie.
3,"That was then, Pussycat!","Was 18 when I saw this in NY in 1965. Laughed till I cried. Loved the LSD inspired title credits. Not much left to recommend now, except for that Bachrach - David musical score. Oh yes!... Who can forget the impact that Paula Prentiss had on 18 year old boys at that time?"
5,Amazing!,Ive only played the first game to PlayStation.(i can't find to buy it anywhere!)It's the best game ever! you should realy buy this game cause im gonna do it right now!
3,Starchaser - Legend of Orin,"This show was ok, but it was too generic as many other science fiction shows that try to copy each other, gave the DVD away."
3,Good Kid's Robot movie,"We bought Starchaser - Legend of Orin for our 4-year-old grandson because he loves robot movies. I watched it with him. He loved it. I enjoyed it also. He took it home with him and he watches it over and over and over. He doesn't really understand the story yet, but it's a worthy story -- good vs. evil, coming of age, saving a civilization -- and when he does, that'll be good also. The animation is very, very good."
3,"this has been released as ""scandinavian night 1970"" by Conoisseur","this has been released in 1995 by Conoisseur as a double cd set ""Scandinavian Nights live in Stockholm 1970"". the cd signifies the same set like another one. if you bought another one pls keep away your fingers from this one. this is only a re-released from the older one.Jonas suisa"

5,The best study aid that i found,"This book helped me pass my chem class w/ a good grade. Although time consuming to do the problems, if you take the time it will help you master the concept & improve your grades. I spent hours doing problems in this book but it was well worth it..."
1,Defective batch?,"I used one of these kits to repair a cracked I had in a tub at a rental property and 9 days later (tonight) I stopped by there and was able to peel the entire patch right off the tub. One end of it had started working loose. The whole patch remained intact... Just thinking for one reason or another, it didn't bond well to tub surface. Tub was plastic.I am pretty handy and installed per manufacturers specs and felt confident with the job I did. Am contacting manufacturer to see what they can do... Refund or new product would be nice.If you still buy this, do not expect it to look pretty or come close to color match. It looks just like it is... A patch."
2,tub repair,"It took much longer to dry than was stated on the package and the almond color didn't even come close to a match, but it is a very strong repair"
4,She Makes you Sweat!!!,"This video is one of my fav's for step aerobics. The steps are a little difficult to do at first, but after you do the workout a couple of times, it gets easier. Donna starts you off with a very through stretch and then gets you heart pumping with innovative steps and complex moves. The ab toning segment is like no other, and I especially like how she tries to make sure that you do not over exert yourself and shows you how to monitor your heart rate. It is not easy, and she does work you, but the results are worth it."
3,It's alright...,"The beats are alright but their nothing compared to the newest CD, The Tunnel. Most of the songs are alright, the best being the Busta Rhymes song."
3,Total Quality Management,"I needs many books with title of Total Quality management, because my disertation topic is TQM."
4,A good introduction to the fiction of Ellroy,"Not as brutal as his earlier books; Black Dahlia or White Jazz, but also more intricate in detail, American Tabloid is the perfect introduction to the twisted fiction of James Ellroy. Here he concentrates on three disctinctivly different main characters, Pete Bondurant, Ward Littel and Kemper Boyd. Bondurant previously appears in Ellroy's LA Cycle of books, but is center stage here. This book is the perfect companion to the recently produced HBO movie The Rat Pack, and also Don DeLillo's Libra. Buy it."
4,Gritty....blood and guts.....lots of fun!,"If half the stuff in this book were true, JKF would have been shot at on a daily basis. I recently saw a hand-lettered sign that read ""Hoffa"" nailed to a light pole in Newark, N.J. Might be a good place to start digging"
2,BORING !!,"Incredible!! Seven hundred pages of violence, nasty words, treason, murders, knives in the back, despisable characters...That's all you've got here. This was the greatest waste of time in my entire life.I believe in the conspiracy to kill Kennedy. I thought it was very intelligent in Ellroy's part to mixture real and inmaginary characters. But I just don't need to poison my brain with all this junk."
4,That style...!,"Ellroy's style is not original, but paradoxically enough... it's unique. The prose here suggest Burroughs, Ginsberg, Kesey, Hemingway, Crane, and Henry James. It's tempting to dock off a couple of points for the sensationalistic approach to the theme, but that itch is counterbalanced by Ellroy's knack for creating goon-types (L.A. Confidential's Bud White comes to mind), such as Big Pete Bondurant. Bondurant is the axis upon which ""American Tabloid"" rotates, though Kemper Boyd might be the most attractive character of all. I caught myself hoping this would get to be made into a movie, just so I would see who would get cast, yet the cinematic medium would actually limit the story by depriving it of its biggest sensory weapon: Ellroy's staccato, battering-ram style."
4,before the USA,It's a nice read for any of you that wish to fill in the void of information between discovery and the constitution.
4,Great Book,"This is a great book with a comprehensive scope about the settlement of America. What sets it apart from any other text is it's scope and approach. Instead of treating American history as a white anglo saxon story Taylor shows us the full range of human experience on the whole North American continent. While his focus is primarily on what would become the continental US he doesn't neglect Mexico or Canada. He also disrupts the traditional storyline of Anglo Saxon landings on the west caost and progressive advance inward into an ""empty continent"". Taylor shows us not only the Amerindians who were living in the American continent but the Spanish and MExicans in much of the American west, the French fur traders in the interior and the Russian settlements in the northeast. This is a great book for anyone wanting an overivew of American settlements."
4,well written,"This overview of early North American colonization is complete in its coverage, including the Carribean and Central America. If anything, I fault the author for the depth with which he explores the non-traditional areas of settlement as it distracts from the more traditional story line. I detected some author's bias, as he seems to hold the Puritans of New England to a higher esteem than other settlers. I believe they were mere mortals like the rest of the world, subject to the same feels, emotions and human frailties. Overall, it is a good book."
1,Great if you like rust with your food,"I got this for a female friend because I had the 16 piece set for Christmas. Little did I know it was the worse mistake ever. Bottom line is they rust like mad. Doesn't matter how you treat them, clean them, use them. TOTAL JUNK I could actually see the rust stains form on them. They didn't come out and the knives scratch if you try to take them out. They are both made in CHINA. Do not buy."
4,Excellent value,I am very pleased with the knife set. The blades are sharp and it exceeds my expectations.I use it every day.
1,Made in China,These looked ok but were poor quality for the price. The edge didnt last long and I was dissapointed to find out that these were made in China.
3,good price..but useless cz too much short knives..I think long and big knives..ÌÌ,good price..but useless cz too much short knives..I think long and big knives..and oem china. so it was cheap.not bad but not good.
3,Didn't keep them,Based on the reviews that I read I decided that this set wasn't for me. I sold it to my neighbor and bought a higher priced forged set so they won't rust
2,Worth Watching,Far from perfect but far from being a bomb too. This is a subject matter that only HBO or Showtime would do today. This is a story of a group of women who have survived the German Death Camps. Its now the 1970's in Los Angeles and these women see the man who harmed them in the death camps. As a group they decide to kill him. An all-star cast makes it worth watching! This is a movie they could and should be re-made.
5,Intro to Elvis' best years,"The Complation Elvis' Gold Records contains 14 of Elvis'gold records. This 1958 complation covers the first couple of years at RCA. Gold Records contains some of Elvis' best known songs. Love Me Tender, Hound Dog, Heartbreak Hotel, Teddy Bear, Jailhouse Rock, All Shook Up, and Don't Be Cruel are among the 14 songs represented, as well as 7 more songs, not as well known these days but, Gold Records is a very good introduction to the music of Elvis Presley, and maybe the only Elvis album that some fans will need."
5,Dyson DC15 - The Animal,"I looked at The Ball and decided to buy one step up and bought the Animal with attachments in purple. I received it today and was amazed with it. So easy to put together and use. My friends say I'm cleaning all the time but after using The Animal now I can say I finally cleaned. I couldn't believe that for berber carpet you don't use the rotating brush but believe me I couldn't get over the amount of dirt and cat hair it pulled out of the carpet even without using the rotating brush. I have only one cat and have lived in my home for a year and a half and shampoo on a regular basis but I have to say, today the carpet is really clean. Best vacuum I've ever bought and I've tried a bunch. Worth every penny. And so easy to empty the dirt cup and you never have to touch the dirt. The ""ball"" makes it so easy to operate in any area and so quiet I found it hard to believe it was running at all."
1,Awful!!,"I bought this stroller for my 14 month old son for an upcoming trip to Disney World. Because of the Britax name, I thought this product would be great. When the stroller arrived, I put it together and then started to go over it's functions. It was soo hard to take down and put up, It takes 2 hands to fold the stroller down, and even then it didn't go down all the way. Within minutes of having it out of the box, I was already taking it apart to return it. Do not bother with this stroller, it's a pain!"
3,Stanley Mitre Box,"You get what you pay for is heard a lot these days, but in this case it is a little better then the cost outlay. Compared to other mitre boxes i have seen at much higher prices this stands up to them. For the handyman it satisfies my wants completely, very happy i made the purchase"
5,Battleship Heavy,"I'm hooked. I first heard ""Lasting Dose"" on my digital cable channel. Crowbar weighs 10,000 pounds. Kirk's vocals are amazing and the band's overall sound is so overdriven and MASSIVE with a capitol ""M"". The disc is heavy from the onset with ""Broken Glass"" being a true standout; but from tracks 6 on, I can't even describe how hard this record hits. Particularly crushing are are ""I Am Forever"" and ""Above, Below..."" and""I'll Live Again"". You will find your own. BOOM BOOM THWAP!!Crowbar surprises you with dead-stop breaks overwhelming crunchy riffs that redefine intensity. Make your headphones happy."
5,My favorite version,"No offense to the Hendrix family, but I sought out this original CD release over the recently re-released version because of a tape copy of a few songs off the album given to me by a friend decades ago. After comparing the 1980's vintage CD to samples from the new release, it seemed pretty obvious that the new release lacks the ""space"" of the older recording, something I can only assume is a result of using only the direct output of the instrument and Jimi's vocal mikes and excluding any sound from additional audience mikes. I have a third version of several of these recordings from a compilation that had tons of reverb added- this version is just right: It sounds like Jimi is playing live in an auditorium, not in my living room. Highly recommended!"
4,Highly valuable and accessible resource,"This book supplies something hard to find: a presentation of the daily lives and routine of the original Buddhist monks, as much as we can get, based on solid research, good translations, and a clear understanding of the Buddha's teachings. It is presented in a style that is not overburdened with technical language or jargon. Tremendously useful and pleasant to read. Here is what they wore, what they ate, how they got it, why they were instructed to travel, and how the monastic code (Vinaya) was interpreted as times changed."
2,Disappointing,I've enjoyed other books Ms. Walker has written but I didn't care for this one much. Lovers Kate and Yolo go separately on spiritual journeys. I found her meandering style in this novel difficult to follow. I liked reading her unique perspective of the world even if I didn't agree with her opinions. I also Googled somethings that she mentioned that I found interesting. Because it's short I stuck with it to the end but can't recommend it. Read her early work instead.
2,Way too new agey and pompous!,"I love Alice Walker's philosophies, but I really found myself loathing the protagonist of this book. Kate was very self-satisfied and arrogant, I thought. I definitely preferred her lover's story/journey to Kate's. The new age aspect to it was a turnoff and though I do embrace some 'new age' practices, I just thought it was too much. Also, the book meandered too much, going from character to character without cohesion. All in all, I found myself forced to get through this since I just couldn't stand Kate. I would not suggest this book to others."
3,Esante satin vest,The product overall looks cute. However it is not true to size.. The top is cut smaller.Cute like i said but not an overall great fit. Unfortunately mine had to be returned..
2,Politics ruins it!!!,"I like the actual music on this CD, but I am VERY disappointed by the fact half the songs are political. Like another reviewer stated, it would be just as bad if they were supporting Bush and bashing liberals. The world is full of political channels to hear and express opinions, and I don't want it in my music!!! If I want political music, I will get a `Rock Against Bush' CD and be done with it. To take it a step farther, they are not particularly clever in their political comments, just feeding people what they want to here and believe.If they had forgone the politics, I would have given this album 5/5 stars, but they just annoyed me.(...)"
1,One song for 15$?!,"Ch Check It Out kills and the rest just fills. One lame, tired song with a tired beat after the next, you can't even tell them apart. If you want to spend 15$ for one great song and then listen to something that will bring a tear to your eye because it is just such a failed effort from the masters then this is the CD for you. It is a poor effort from the dudes who gave us Ill Communication and Check Your Head, it really is a fast food version of the Beasties. If you want to return it even though you have already opened it just take the CD down to your local store with the receipt, put the opened one in the bin, take out an unopened one and return that. You aren't stealing anything just getting your money back and rightfully so...this thing isn't worth .15$ let alone 15$!"
4,if you like the beasties this is a great,honestly i bought this cd for mix master mike.I like the way he dj's and if you like cool beats this is great. the bush bashing don't bother me too much atleast it ain't bout hoes and 24 inch car rims
1,Don't waste your money,"This album is not woth buying, I only like 3 songs on the album and I also don't care to know or hear the Beastie Boy's political views. I think it is time for the Beastie Boys to retire."
1,What the FUDGE!!!,"I'm a huge B-boys fan, but this is their worst album ever. Their political views really distract from the album. Who wants to listen to that 5 years from now. The whole album is samples and flat rhymes about endless Political Crap. At least with Mario C you got some of their instrumentials. They must have sold their instruments to produce this album.They went from Rappin about Girls, White Castle, and Beer to rippin on Bush and the war in Iraq. What the Fudge Happened here.Just proves that teh B-boys couldn't produce a quality album on their own. Mix Master Mike Has Got To Go.B-Boys, Please Get Mario C, DJ Hurricane, and The Dust Brothers Back!!! You Really Need Help. I could have produced something better given 6 years time."
2,Blind hatred has ruined the Beastie Boys.,"Have you ever been in a fight with someone and justblurted out something stupid. Blinded by your own emotionThat's pretty much this album. It seems as though theircreativity has been stifled by this deep resent for Bush.For the love of god! Make me great music! I don't come toyou for guidance or propaganda. I come to you tosmoke the smoke and drink the drink. If you have amessage, wrap it in a metaphor like art. Not like someliteral Moby blather. I feel cheated because I voted withmy dollar without even knowing you are using my dollarto vote against my ideals. I think I will put Brass Monkey on."
4,This album is DOPE!,"I was genuinely surprised at how good the boyz' latest product is. I liked Hello Nasty, but felt that they lost their edge and swagger. They got a little too clownish. I hate to say this, but there wasn't any profanity at all on Hello Nasty, not that you need that for a great album, but that's just not the Beastie Boys. Well, To The Five Boroughs to me is a cross between License To Ill & Paul's Boutique. They got their swagger back but it's more mature. After all, when your pushing 40, you can't keep rapping about partying, women and whiffle ball bats. That would just be silly. Instead, they are able to express the social and political climate of our times in the context of Hip Hop while still throwin' out goofy lyrics and great dance beats!"
4,"And If You Don't Like, Then HEY....","This album is pretty straight. Alot of people is dissin this album because they wanted to hear the new generation sound with the old pioneers. And ya actually thought that these MCs were going to sell out for ya. ""Put in quarter in you a$$ because you played yourself.""Top 3 Songs: Check it Out, Right Right Now Now, HEY $#%! YOUBottom 3 Songs: Shazam!, The Brouhaha, Oh Word?Sleeper:3 Tha Hard WayAnybody who says these guys are whack, you need to die"
3,Musically dissapointing,"This cd is definitely for the lyric lover. It seems the beasty boys have put much creative effort in conveying their message in rhyme. Furthermore I find the explicitness of the lyrics refreshing.However, creativity and innovation remain absent in the rythmic and melodical aspects of this CD.""An open letter to NYC"", ""right right now now"" being the exception.In my opinion the artists missed an opportunity to apply the musical creativity on the cover track to the rest of the tracks. The current CD lacks in inter- and intra-track rythmic and melodic variation."
3,"more politics, less filling","not the traditional party-fun-silly type we are used to. the beastie boys seem to have matured into to the beastie men. much more grown up, ah but still enriching to hear the voices we remember. those havent changed. thumbs up to beastie boys because i dont think they get the credit they deserve as pioneers of modern rap /hip hop style music. they did and continue to mix rap with more beats,mixes, and music than modern rap does today. i was just a bit surprised at all the political commentary, however cant say i didnt totally agree with them."
1,How the Mighty Have Fallen,"Talk about a dissappointment. The Beastie Boys used to be one of the hottest act around and were near legendery status, then this album came out. I'm not sure what happened and I don't quite know how to explain it, but this album is terrible at best. I'll be sticking to their older material, which is incredible and worth a listen."
2,Points Prove Nothing,"i was waited for this album for a long time but when i bought it , i found it quiet disapointing because i thought that they would include a bit of Metal , punk or rock but that wasnt there but what can i say and if i compare this to License To ILL . This is nothing comapre to it and i also excepted for some fast tempo music and i wasted my freaking money for this piece of crap . all of their songs are between 2 and 3 mintuesThis is strange but they had gangsta rap and i thought these bunch of people were smart not to put this type of music cause that type of music is needed for rappers who are talentless and make crap .Whhat a waste of my time"
4,No politics at the dinner table...,"I agree with the other review, too much Bush bashing in too many tracks. I would have given this 5 stars if it wasn't for the politics - this topic is way to complex for the Boys to understand. But having said all that, the Beastie Boys are back! And it's about time."
3,"Decent, I guess -- by thedvs01","What happened to rapping about partying and boasting about mic skills? Instead we get liberal political rantings. 'Ch-Check it Out' is great, and I love the beat on 'Right Right Now Now' but the political views really detract from this album. The fact that I don't agree with the Beasites' political views is irrelevant - the fact of the matter is that a Beastie Boys album is definatley not the right place for them to spout their political rantings (e.g. ""George W. got nuttin on me - we got to take the power from he""). The beats aren't as bad as some people are saying, and neither are the lyrics, I just feel that the Beasties should keep their politics and their music separate.(...)"
2,Write music not political propaganda,I liked it better when musicians just played music instead of using it as a polictical forum. I have always liked the beastie boys but as I listen to this album I realize that these guys have flat out lost it. The lyrics are beat. They sit and try and to bash on George Bush. Come on guys. They should go back to the grass roots of No sleep to Brooklyn and quit trying to be politicians. BUSH IN 04!!
2,out with the old school,"If anyone is expecting to hear the old school sound from beastie boys, you'll be very disappointed. The song ch-check it out is the best song on the cd. If I had realized how much I would dislike the album, I never would have bought it. In my opinion it doesn't deserve the 14$ worth of support I gave."
2,major disapointment,this is easily the last B-Boys cd i would ever put in my CD player if i had to choose between them all. this album of songs is really thin and hardly has the replay value of ALL the other ones before it.oh and the F-bombs are in every song...? im not a loser who cant have sware words in there music but for the Beasties it just sounds stail and lacks creativity...the power of the F-word gets diluted after hearing it over and over.the enhanced part of this disc is crap too. Beastie videos are ussaly fun and entertaining but this one just has them on a NY roof top in big coats striking poses.......? what happened to these guys?
4,Better after a 2nd listen...,I have always dug the Beastie Boys. I was 16 when their first album came out and have grown up with them. Each album has been unique. This one is no different. After the first listen I was disappointed. The beats weren't hitting as hard as their other records. The rhymes were cool but it just didn't work for me. And I was born in Manhattan...But after listening to it a few more times it has really grown on me. There are only 2 or 3 singles on the record but the other dozen tracks are solid old school hip hop. I then realized that this album was a shout out to 1985 or so when rap was about bragging about how good you are as an MC and stripped down beats. No bitches and hoes. Sure a few tracks show off the Beastie's politics but as a whole it reminded me when rap was FUN. And there is a lot of fun on this album....
4,Good enough and sometimes great...,"Basically, I agree with the one reviewer who said that this is a stripped-down bare bones Beastie effort. There are elements of this album that can hang with anything underground or otherwise that i've heard this year. There are elements that are straight whack. Don't be fooled. This is a good album with some brilliance particularly towards the end. The beats are pretty insane. Some of the preachy political stuff grates on me. But it's just simple old school message-based rap. I'm blown away that they'd actually come out with something which is basic after all of their transformations. It's good, and at times very danceable. But, not great..."
1,Blade doesn't retract,"The knife works, but the design where there isn't a switch to pull the blade back into the knife is inconvenient to say the least. You have to go fishing around inside the body of the knife in order to put a blade in place. Because it's a hassle, it just sits in my toolbox and I use a swiss army knife or a multi-tool instead. Poor product design, not based around the user."
5,Just what I was looking for,Easy to install! Gives me more use of my boat in the winter. I live in the south were temps almost never go below freezing for a few hours and gives me peace of mind that the engine compartment is nice and toasty!
4,"A Step Above the Debut, But Still Searching...","Yes, this album is defitely an improvement over the somewhat ""gay"" ""Speak and Spell""! The musical ideas of ""Leave in Silence"",""My Secret Garden"", ""Nothing to Fear"" or my favorite, excellent ""Sun and the Rainfall"" are breaking through with a promise of better things to come, but the ""spirit"" of the departed Vince Clark still lingers in the so-so ""See You"". A special recognition should be reserved to a nearly industrial (ahead of its time) creepy, ""Shouldn't Have Done That"" with brilliant anti-Fascist lyrics about an abused child gone horribly wrong.Depeche Mode start thinking on this one and the next album will finally reveal the pearl inside the shell of surrounding mediocrity."
1,Beyond irritating,"This should be the next product that Amazon requires to be in its new ""fuss-free"" packaging. The entire contents are contained in a nuclear-explosion-proof blister pack, multiple staples must be pried out of the folded-up instruction leaflet before it can be opened and read, the wireless keypad itself is encased in a huge sticky label that splits apart into a thousand little strips when you try to peel it away, and worst of all, the three of us couldn't remove the battery cover, which is required in order to access the second hole for wall mounting and comes with no guidance other than ""slide it off."" With what, a jackhammer? I'm stunned that the manufacturer went to such great lengths to make such a simple product as irritating to the consumer as possible. Thankfully, Amazon is extremely consumer-friendly with its generous return policies."
5,"Find ""Real Food"" in Orlando","This author writes restaurant reviews for the local paper, so I trust his judgement. This book covers around 100 restaurants in all price ranges. Use it to find a good lunch spot or to plan a special occasion/splurge meal.This clues you in to the specialties of the restaurants, how good the service is, etc. There are maps to help you find the places."
5,moose,"Flavor was not bad, liked it better than the choc. thought it helped with my long training runs, planning on running in a 1/2 marathon this week-end and planning on using it , like the directions 45 min and 15 min before race, better than a cup of coffee( for the caffeine) that may upset the GI track!"
2,Very basic information - not very helpful,I really did not find this book helpful. It provided some very basic information but nothing really useful. There are much better books out there.
4,Good but older,"This book will point you in the right direction for great mountain bike places to ride. Unfortunately things change as open space gets sold and turned into houses and shopping centers. This particular publishing (1996) is a bit out of date, but many of the trails I have ridden have been just as described in the book. I bought it used, so I have no complaints."
4,Fun fun fun ART,These books are beautifully done and enjoyable to look at art. My two girls 8-10 spent an hour trying to find all the red dots on each page. The text is simple but poetic. Only problem is you need to be very careful when you open the book the first time because some of the pop-ups get stuck together and can very easily tear.
3,In The Red - A bit contrived,"In the Red is a rather ordinary ""thriller"" without much in the way of thrills. It follows a British Agent from the early post-war years in China to occupied Germany to the UN in NYC. He is a bit of a loose cannon for the bureaucrats, and he has to keep clearing his name. The situations are fraught with coincidences, and the eventual ending comes as a strong anticlimax. Not one of Egleton's better efforts."
3,Solid Goth Metal,"A pretty good album by a new group. The guitar playing leans a little too much towards chords, but there is some talent at work on some of the songs. I like the vocals here a lot, clear and actual singing instead of screaming. I look forward to checking out future albums because this group should have a good future."
4,This is NOT the same as a conventional gas oven,"I have a CTO8000 and it worked great until one day I placed a sheet of aluminum foil to cover a meatloaf I was baking. Well after a half hour and it looked the same as when I first put it in, I investigated and discovered that the oven was still cool and I think I burned out the thermostat because my oven no longer bakes (due to the relection from the foil). I can't believe I did this. It's now just a big toaster. I hope to afford another one someday because I really liked this oven and I got it as a gift. I just wanted people to be aware because the B&D instructions do not make this clear."
3,Takes up WAY too much counter space!,"This toaster oven has a silly bump sticking out of the back, so it has to stay approximately 4"" in front of the back splash on the counter. It's way too wide, too. It cooks the same amount as our last one, but takes up twice the space. The ""bump space is handy only if you're cooking round pizzas."
2,Push-button for toast stopped working,Very disappointed. Been using B&D products for 30 years. Three smaller toaster-ovens were fine. But in less than 12 months the push-button for the new larger toaster stopped working.
5,Feels Right In Your Hand,"I love this hammer. I've used it every day for the last year on everything from rough framing to finish work. ""The Better Mousetrap"" review played a big role in my decision in the 20oz Stanley over the classic Estwing. It's true that you really feel a difference hitting concrete. It's also very well balanced. I can flip it and throw it with surprising accuracy. Not that it helps me build anything, but I feel very comfortable with it in my hand. I worked on a crew with some guys who carried wooden handled Stilettos. They're nice, I liked them, but I'd still choose my Stanley."
5,"Oldie, but goodie!","I' m only 26 so I wasn't even born when ""What's Happening"" was on TV, but I use to catch re-runs a few years back. I just had to have this to own and enjoy whenever I want to. It's still funny over 25 years later! Dee is too much! Even my 7 year old son watches and laughs along with me! They don't make shows like this anymore!! I enjoyed every episode on every disc!!"
5,The best season of What's Happening!,"This season is the funniest of TV shows I remember watching as a kid. Here are the reasons:The Doobie Brother's episodes....""Which Doobie do you be?"" - Til' this very day, any time Michael Mc Donald appears on Tom Joyner/Steve Harvey, they use that joke. And strangly, it is still funny.Dee's first date ""Well it worked on 'Baretta'"" How many times have you told your momma that.The Givens Kids episode...with that catchy ""brown bubblin' sugar"" song.Rerun worships lettace...'nuff said.If this is not a reason to run out and buy it...then see the third season of What's happening....you'll apppreciate this one more."
4,"No Roger, No Re-Run, No Rent","I wasn't born until after the show ended, but I loved watching the re-runs while I was growing up (and I still like watching them, although I have each of the seasons on DVD). It was a great show with a strong message about our society."
1,Psp car charger,I bought this for my grandsons and the plugin on the PSP end is very loose-it will only charge if you hold it in. I would not reccomend it.
3,A disappointment,"It is always of great interest to read anything about Bob Marley, and even more exciting to read the words of the man himself. However, I have to say I found this book disappointing.It will certainly form a part of my Bob Marley memorabilia collection, but considering just how many of his actual words and sayings are easily available both in his Songs and in his recorded and published Interviews. there could have been so much more!In the Foreword his daughter Cedella says ""My father lives in these words"". Yes, he does! But the chance was missed to maximise her father's messsage by a more comprehensive selection of quotations."
4,Plenty of new thinking!,"This book, small, yet powerfull, allowed me to understand more into the thinking of Bob Marley. he truely was an innovative and creatvie man. Using his words of song to change the way people think, as well as open their eyes to the world around them and understand the Rastafarian Way of life. ""60 and still smokin'"""
2,Too mellow.,"I enjoy Moby a lot although this last cd was not what I expected from the fast paced, good rhythm DJ. I though this cd was way too slow for my taste: ""Homeward Angel"", ""Temtation"" . Some of his tunes were especially ""Dream About You"", was lame as a song and as a beat. The only song that I thought had any merit was ""lift me up"", I was expecting more from Moby and gave him a 2 on this cd."
3,Not his best,"The sounds of ""Hotel"" are simply not as thumping and exciting as anything on ""Play,"" nor are they as sinuous and insightful as anything from ""18."" ""Hotel"" sounds less like the progress of a maturing artist than a half-hearted collection of songs that Moby may not have released except for increasing pressure to come out with something new.""Hotel"" lacks the ragged edges of Moby's earlier works and almost comes off as a prepackaged group of sounds to be chopped up and placed in Volkswagen commercials. It's still pleasant to listen to, but it doesn't have the ""gotta start the whole CD over again"" grab that ""Play,"" and, to a lesser degree, ""18"" have.If you are new to Moby, stick with the classics. If you want to listen to some decent but not groundbreaking dance tracks and a couple of moody makeout songs, go ahead and get ""Hotel."""
3,The safe route,"Unfortunately, Moby has gone the safe route on this one. No samples to be found anywhere. Doesn't appear to be a challenging album for him to produce at all - seems like he is happy heading towards the MOR direction - adult radio is where he will stay.CD2 - Ambient - is the better of the two. I presume that Moby is a fan of Brian Eno after listening to it.The female vocals on CD1 are the best vocal tracks - Laura Dawn should of sung all of the songs. The version of 'Temptation' is a good take - not as slow but similar to Tori Amos' 'smells like teen spirit'.overall, not bad - not great - very safe - will be forgotten soon - won't stand out in the Moby backcatalogue."
4,Moby's 'Hotel' is worth checking into,"'Hotel' is a solid release from the very talented Moby, but it's certainly not his best work (I highly recommend 'Play' for its inventiveness). It is a consistent album that's always listenable, and although there are a few standout tracks, it never reaches greatness as a whole. The best part of the album is the second half, with such standouts like 'Love Should', 'Slipping Away', and 'Where You End'. The best song on the album for me is 'Raining Again', a great techno song that has some very clever lyrics: 'it's raining again, out on your car like bullets on tin'. 'Hotel' is predictable Moby, but it's quite an enjoyable experience for fans who know what to expect from this gifted artist."
3,SO So,"I believe Moby's best album will always be ""play"". I think he captured something there that won't be easily obtained again in his future works. But it's worth a shot for him to try. I'm not saying he should do a Play part2 album. What I'm saying is that to evolve from the HUGE commercial and artistic success of the album Play is something very hard to do.The album ""18"" fell short and the ""18 B-sides"" was just a little side thing that seemed to be more acceptable than the original ""18"" album.Now he comes back with Hotel and I must say that the songs for the most part on the first CD are weak. If anything, it's the second ambient CD that saves the Hotel album. The vibe that I get from the 2nd CD is remote and pretty esoteric. I think the ambient cd would be perfect for a film such as Lost In Translation.All in all, I'd say this is for Moby's hardcore fans."
1,oh dear,"Sorry to say, but this is one (well 2) expensive coasters.I listened to it all the way through & was more than unthrilled.The next time, I got as far as the diabolical cover version of New Order's Temptation & threw the discs in the bin.Moby needs to go back to his punk roots & keep this rubbish to himself.I had to give it a star or my review can't be submitted, but I can award a star for the cd case which is handy to replace any broken ones I might have."
3,A few tracks on this CD are great! - Though not as good as other Moby's before,"A few of the tracks on this CD are great - especially tracks 1 and 13. Tracks 4 and 6 are also good and Track 14 is OK. But as for the other tracks on here I don't think to highly on, because I feel they are out of his element of music.I have heard better from Moby - such as a few of the tracks from previous Moby records - such as Play, Play The B-Sides, 18 and MobySongs.But I think highly of him as a great musical manipulizer, knowing presciselly which musicial keys to use in order to bring out the full feeling of his music.His techno, ambient and instumental music is some of the best music of its kind I know and to think he traded his fantasic techno and ambient music for some other kind of music makes me wonder what the future holds for any upcoming records he may create.Either way, he is a great musician and anything that Moby does is known to bridge the borders now and then, because that is Moby.Keep on rocking Moby!"
1,Someone should tell Moby that he can't sing,"Moby is a talented guy, so let's get that out of the way. But his talent is in the area of music composition. Someone somewhere heard him sing and encouraged the poor man, and now we have this, a dismal disaster from a pampered misguided sould who's otherwise brilliant. The man can't sing, and if his fans care about him at all they should tell him to shut up and instead put his fingers to the keyboard and do what he does best: compose music and sample other people's voices."
4,Second disk saved it.,"So I was at tower records the other day, picking up some CDs I was looking for, when I spotted Moby's Hotel. I shrugged and decided to throw it in the pile.The first disk was OK. Some good tunes, interesting variety, generally solid. I'd give it 3 stars, not great, not bad. Then I remembered I got a bonus disk of ambient music, which I've always loved, so I popped it in.Turns out Moby can still write ambience, and he's as good at is as ever. I sat there for a while enjoying the tranquil sounds, uninterrupted bu human voices, guitar solos, loud drums, or anything rock-like, which is where the first disk turned. What a pleasant surprise.It seems, after reading the short paragraph in the disk sleeve, that Hotel Ambience is what the first disk should have been. More peaceful, less human, more descriptive of the strange living place that Hotels provide.I reccomend this for Disk 2. Disk 1 is a nice bonus."
3,Weirdo,"As to this recording, I feel that the compositions originating from Moby (I don't think he always composes music) often serves as proof that Moby is an artist with his own approach to music, rather than a musical genius. If musical experts wish to see in him some kind of being out-of-the-ordinary, they may well find that in his job. He has found his own manner of saying what he wishes to say, his style, which is quite a lot, because many fail to establish their place in the music industry or to continue in the same vein (reviving their recordings with new ideas). But that seems to be all there is to it as far as this CD is concerned. Moby probably knows (but I'm not quite certain) that when he sings himself he makes the same mistake that Michael Cretu has done before. For some other reasons, Moby's songs could be referred to as Sadness Part 3 and so on. Incidentally, this also has something to do with Cretu."
2,Not Moby's Strongest Effort,"I loved ""Play"", I liked ""18""... But ""Hotel"" really just didn't do it for me. Nothing on this album really stands out. He would have been better off making a lot shorter album with better quality music. This cd is worth owning if you are already a fan of Mobys. It definately sounds like moby.. I was just disappointed to see that he doesn't seem to be growing with each album. Most of it was pretty generic. If this is your first Moby purchase, I'd recommend you go with Play or 18 for a better experience."
3,MCDONALDS DID GOOD,AS YOU ALL KNOW THIS CD WAS ONLY SOLD AT MCDONALDS. I WORKED THERE AT THE TIME IT WAS RELEASED. WE SOLD SO MANY I WAS NEVER ABLE TO GET ONE. NOW THAT I FINALLY HAVE ONE I LOVE IT. THE REMIXES MAKE FOR A COOL PARTY CD. JUST GET IT NO WORRIES.
2,Nordic Wok is lightweight and warped,"The Nordic wok was large, but much lighter than I expected. It also had a warped bottom. Unfortunately we needed the flat bottom to match the flat-top stove. The pan rocks on the burner and cooks unevenly."
1,Not Clearly Described,"When I received this item, it became apparent that it required a separate base station to operate the phone. That would have to be another purchase that I did not anticipate. No where in the advertisement did it state that this was an extension of another item.I was able to return the item but the cost of shipping both from and to the seller was expensive."
2,"Good reference, not just for people taking exam., except...","The kit covers most topics, serves me as a good reference, except occassionally, I was indexed to pages that are missing, e.g.: Architecture & Administration and Backup & Recovery Study Guide, page 254 -- page 287 (for Object Privileges)."
5,Very helpful for beginners,This is one of the best machining books I've had. It is really helpfull when you are designing a new part.
5,Right in either global or down to nits and bits,"I have found this book fulfilling my expectations in every respect just as previous issues had been doing for all those years gone by.It contains our traditional English standards, American or British, together with ISO. I am valuing this in a world when ISO is forced for its own shake, often times.It is also important that this book is much more than just a good and exhaustive collection of all of the applicable tabulated technical data; it includes basics that are supported by easy to follow algebra. Yet, it is still in a volume that easily fits on the desktop of practicing designers, drafters in the same way as its smaller format resides on the bench top of machinists."
2,Just Google,"This book takes people's money and uses up trees. Just use the Internet and you'll get a lot more information, and for free. People in the publishing industry--editors and agents--move around like gophers, popping up here and there on a regular basis. No book is going to be reliable, and a book made up of sloppily acquired information is going to be worse than no book at all, because you'll think it's right. Even the Internet sources can steer a writer to obsolete information, but at least you have numerous sources to draw from."
1,pink flamingos,this was a ridiculously HORRID movie. don't waste your money on it. love amazon though :o)
2,Furthermore...,"What I meant to say...was that it was not the excessive filth in Pink Flamingos that offended me, it is that I'm supposed to revere this film as some sort of cult masterpiece of obscenity when really any class of seventh graders could have come up with this banal level of smut."
2,Well....,"Um, how does one review a movie like this? Sick, disgusting, repulsive, and utterly repellant, it is also unbelievably funny. This movie will help you become more self aware than any other you've seen simply because you'll find yourself laughing at things you never thought you were capable of finding funny.However, you have been warned. If you think you might not want to see this movie YOU DON'T! END"
1,Blech!,"This is one of John Water's earlier attempts, and he must have been smoking some really bad weed when he directed this one. The acting was terrible, and the dialogue was boring. Disappointing."
5,The best compliation in sound and price yet not complete!,"I first bought some Jimmie Rodgers albums in the early 70's when RCA released a bunch of his stuff on various albums. This CD has the best sound I have ever heard but one of my favorites is missing ""Jimmie The Kid"". He was the first country superstar 1927-33 and recorded about 133 songs before his death in 1933 of TB. He was a wonderful singer and his yodels make me feel better. I feel like howling at the moon when I hear them! An essential purchase and a major part of American music history."
3,Dated and missing things,"The short-line world has changed quite a bit in the years since publication. It's time for an update. What the guide does provide is interesting and generally accurate. Edward A. Lewis is perhaps the countries best authority on the subject and has managed several shortlines for many years. I suspect the problems of the book come from Kalbach trying to make it too small - it's glove box format. I'd rather have more information in an 81/2 x 11 format. It has locomotive rosters, capsule histories and other data. What is missing is train operations. Knowing this changes, perhaps the next edition should have an accompanying database of this information, updated by users as it changes. Another missing item are maps. As another reviewer has noted, the photographs could be better."
1,Mediocre at best,"While providing some idea of what living in Beirut was like, as an american who grew up in Beirut, I found this an uninsightful blase accounting of what were extremely exciting times, to say the least. This is good example of why foreign reporters were generally regarded as idiots by fellow americans living in the region. It is particularly amusing, that Mr Freidman currently enjoys celebrity status based in large part on this C- work. That's some good marketing!"
5,New Understandings/New Perspectives,"This is one of the finest and most intelligent and interesting books I have ever read. It opened my eyes and widened my perspectives, providing me with a new and thorough understanding of the historical basis for the Middle East situation and conflicts. It describes in intelligent and vivid detail what life in the Middle East is really like for both Arabs and Israelis, and presents the real issues driving the politics of that region--something we are rarely given in our news media. The book is extremely well written and displays both the genius of Thomas Frieman and his genuine caring for the region and its peoples. As the cover says, if you only read one book on the Middle East, this is the one to read."
2,All over the place,"I did not enjoy this book. The book is very disjoint does not give the reader an understanding of this very important topic. Instead he more or less just tells you a bunch of stories of things that he encountered while in the middle east. No real connection between them, just a bunch of stuff he came across over his 30 years of reporting. There's a lot of unnecessary information in these stories. I found the examples/scenarios far too specific and as a result the writing did not help me understand the BIG PICTURE."
2,A poor sequel for a great character,"As much as I love Elric and the Melnibonean mythology, SAILER ON THE SEAS OF FATE is a disappointing follow up to ELRIC OF MELNIBONE.The book starts with Elric finding himself in a strange land. He boards a mysterious ship and sails off to the first of three unrelated, convenient adventures which do little to progress the overall saga. The stories serve more to explain the whole ETERNAL CHAMPION concept, along with giving details of MELNIBONE'S history and the interaction of all the planes of existence. And ultimately, after 160 pages, nothing really happens.Though the book is about Elric and his adventures, I found myself really wishing to hear news of Melnibone and the characters who Elric left behind. They are all as much a part of the fun and adventure in the first volume as is Elric. They should have been given some attention."
2,I didn't understand it,I'm starting to read this book and it is one that takes a lot of time to concentrate to understand. I'm sadden to not see a very good summary posted. does anyone know what this book is about? what is the summary?
3,Just OK thermal coffee maker,"I've had my Mr. Coffee since Christmas '06. I thought to wait before writing my review after using it for awhile and trying different coffee beans. This is my second (different brand) Thermal Coffee maker. It makes decent coffee. Keeps coffee hot for a couple of hours. (after pre-warming pot) Pause-and-serve function spills a couple of teaspoonsfulls. My work-around, pull pot partly away from drip spout and catch coffee drips until it stops. I don't use the timer because I like to grind coffee beans at time of making coffee and not sitting in the coffee maker over night. On/off function shuts off after brewing. Coffee maker is attractive, but not well made. My coffee maker lid sits off center. Not a big deal, but more steam escapes because of this. Some reviewers had pouring problems. I found matching the lid arrow to spout gives the best pouring. Can be messy while getting that last drop. Overall this coffee maker is ""OK"" until I find a better one."
4,Good little pot,"I've had this coffee pot for years now, and it hasn't let me down (yet). The lid situation is a little tricky, but once you get used to it it's not as bad as it seems. It's probably the only Mr. Coffee product that hasn't let me down."
2,Coffe is not HOT enough!,"Even when you use hot water to warm the thermos, the coffee doesn't brew hot enough.The design of the caraffe is difficult to get in & out and it's awkward to pour out the last cup.not a great coffee maker."
1,Not at all what I expected from Mr Coffee!!!,"This coffee maker only lasted about 1 yr or so,..& in fact no matter which Mr Coffee I buy,..they NEVER last anymore,...I guess besides the lids on this one being a royal pain,..I personally do not think its worth the money at all,.I don't feel that this one even makes good coffee at all either,..(.no matter which coffee I buy,)....I am going to look at some different brands like Bunn,...or something along that line of coffee maker,..that may hopefully,...last a ""few"" yrs!!! LH"
3,It's ok,"The coffee pot works fine...but the delay brew feature stopped working within the first year, which is one of the reasons I bought it. Do like the thermal pot, since you can't break it like the glass carafes. Would I buy it again, probably not."
1,Who designed this?,"How not to design a carafe - turn the cap 1/2 turn and the coffee dribbles out. 30 minutes after brewing, the coffee is about 80 degrees even with reheating. Preheating, hey, I thought this was a thermal carafe. Has anyone looked at the interior shape of the carafe? I think that is why the coffee dribbles out. On the plus side, the coffee tastes great. I kept the packaging/boxes."
3,It's ok.....,"I love the Stainless steel part, also the 8 cup.The opening to the carafe is not wide enough to get your hand down in there to clean, you have to use a baby bottle cleaner/ sponge. It doesn't stay on after brewing to keep the coffee hot. Probably so the stainlee steel won't get really hot. If I don't get a cup right away, I have to heat it more in the microwave. You have to unscrew the top to pour you coffee and then tighten it again"
2,a great unbreakable pot- not much else,"after breaking yet another glqass carafe, i decided to find a coffee pot with a steel one. the cost of replacing briken carafes becomes extensive over time. this model has a lined steel carafe that is bulletproof. wrapped around the great carafe is an average coffee maker that makes average coffee. sometimes the auto shutoff stops a little early leaving an almost full brew that is lukewarm. also, the pause and serve feature is useless and a great way to make a big mess. if you pour a cup during the brew cycle, the coffee continues to build up in the basket. when you replace the carafe, that built up coffee floods out all over the place. the carafe lid design is not able to catch it all. i suppose most of this could be easily laughed off- but not at 6:30am. i'm looking for a better solution. if after reading these reviews, you still choose this model, email me. i have one for sale."
1,Don't Buy This!!!!!!!!,"Yes it makes coffee. It even looks nice. The lid is a nightmare and you CANNOT pour a cup of coffee without spilling coffee on the counter. Whoever designed this carafe dropped the ball....just terrible. If you are smart, you will look elsewhere for a coffeemaker."
5,great compiled work,"I think this book fulfills its purpose excellently. It provides a starting point for anyone who wants to examine the Hermetic teachings. I would never recommend this book for someone who is studying the Corpus Hermetica and its history itself, but for anyone who just wants an easy-to-read format of wisdom compiled from a daunting source, this is a great book. At the least, it is a good way to get someone who may know nothing at all about Hermetics to take a deeper interest. From reading it I feel like the authors had best interest at heart, it does not seem like an effort to obscure the hermetic teachings, but rather to make them much more accessible and appealing than they have been for years."
2,A nibble of the Hermetica,"This book is the condensed crib-note version of the Hermetica. You can read it entirely on one cross town bus trip. It's enough to peak curiosity, but this is such a small extract of the entire Hermetica that it's nearly useless. It's just a sound-bite."
3,It is okay,Told to stop using this also. It still should work for someone that doesn't use albuterol. Goodproduct just not for me.
5,"A Great, Fun Read","While it may have some flaws, this is a really fun, exciting, and unique read. It combines elements of mysticism, native American history, fantasy, adventure, and good old fashioned story telling. Louis never claimed to be a Shakespearan level writer -- he always said he was a campfire story teller -- and this shows why he was the best around. I never could get into his westerns, but I did love this one. I wish he had done few more like it."
2,L'Amour wrote at least 27 better!,"I have read 28 L'Amour novels and prize most of them very highly indeed. But Haunted Mesa is one of the last of his to read. As others have indicated, it needed a good editor to cut it in half--the constant return to the same redundant ideas and questions and musings is quite tiresome. It does not advance the action or the thoughts of the characters. The undigested references to scientific concepts of a ""4th dimension"" in space-time, and quantum mechanics, does not give plausibility to the fantasy plot of a tribe of cliff-dwellers and others falling through a ""door"" in ""space-time""; and the story itself does not rise to mytho-poetic resonance. And as a professor of religious studies, I would have to say that it does little to advance our understanding or appreciation of Anasazi religion."
2,Not His Best Work,"First of all, I love Louis L'Amour's books, and have read all of his western novels multiple times. This one is set in a more modern 1970's or so setting, adn there were just too mnay repetitive references to the past and the main characters special abilities. I'd save your money and pick up the first Sackett book."
3,A Rushed Write,"The internal dialogue of the main character Mike Raglan repeated itself so many times throughout the book that it appeared to this reader the Mr. L'Amour rushed through this book much too fast. The plot was a great idea, the characters were developed enough to at least judge their character, but the book could have been edited down to less than half the length. After finishing the book, I felt like it had wasted my time. It was fun and mysterious, but contained way too much filler through internal dialogue and left little room for the real meat of the story."
1,SOMETHINGS WRONG HERE FOLKS,"I can't believe this book was written by such a well respected and widely published (90 novels) author. The fact that he died the year following its release may be a factor. The repetition in this book is unbelievable. It could be shortened by a third and would lose nothing. There are places where he seems to lose the thread and starts back at a different tangent.I found the story line interesting in spite of being very far out. I see it is available here for one cent,buy it and be prepaired to skip many pages. However I wouldn't pay much more."
1,Not Good,"I think the premise was good. The action hero protagonist was fine. The settings were interesting. But the plot was jagged, characters were underdeveloped, there was too much repetition, not enough plausibility in the relationships or character's motivations, and far too many coincidental happenings. It seems like the book wasn't fully completed. It's a great sketch that needs a lot of work."
4,A kid confused,I thougth this book was good but not great it reapeats. It has great parts that will keep you reading but parts that will make you whant to throw it away.
2,Probably the worst book ever written by L'amour,"This book is read like a dog chasing his tail round and round, or like the window on the mesa to go to the other side; dragging along and so contritedly written. When L'amour became so old, he's just trying so hard to probe the other side of the world, if any or ever existed. There are so many repeated pages that read the same, very tiresome to read along."
3,Average,"This was my first L'Amour book. I know he is a great storyteller so will not judge him on this one book. However, I can judge the story, itself.Found this to be quite repetitive, and Raglan goes through the same thoughts over and over again. (""Do I have to?"")Nevertheless, after living 7 years in the Southwest, I recognised several of the areas he was referrring to, and share the same love of the beauty of the land, that L'Amour and his characters do.Will discuss this in book club this week, and see what others in the group thought."
1,NOT A GOOD DEAL,"The ""Hounds"" CD included here is the 1997 remastered, expanded version.However, ""Sensual"" is the original 1989 release (that has never been remastered and sounds terrible on CD).So, the added expense of this set, which offers nothing more than a cheap outside slipcover to the two discs, isn't a ""best buy"". You can readily purchase the stand-alone remastered ""Hounds"" for less than half the price of this set.There was much 'net chatter two years ago that Kate was remastering her catalog, but nothing has ever been released.That includes the 2006 release of the expensive Japanese ""LP mini-sleeve"" CD's; they are the same old masters that have been around for 20 years."
5,Elvis at his best!,If you loved Elvis or still love Elvis this is a must have. I am glad I purchased this CD.
2,An interesting but shallow read,"It is the year 2030 in this novel, and oil has become much scarcer and more expensive. John Grant may have come up with a solution to the energy crises, and he is a part of a complicated plot that skips around a lot and is hard to follow at times. There is war in the Middle East (what's new!), and this war does spread, a picture of a not rosy future.I found that Bart Kosko did not do very well in character development and also did poorly in describing places and scenery. It seems this novel should have been longer to flesh it out.In this book you will read about mind transfers to computer chips, artificial wombs, nanotechnology, and other technology about thirty years down the road, and all of this was done in a satisfactory way, but there is a lot more better science fiction out there to read, unless of course the subject matter of this book should interest you."
1,Where's the old Jonathan Kellerman?,"Boring, boring, boring. That just about sums up this book. Sorry Mr. Kellerman -- you need you get your old spark back. You used to be so readable, but your recent books are sluggish at best."
2,More than a little disappointed....,I always look forward to Jonathan Kellerman's books - but I didn't like this one. The plot just didn't do it for me. I didn't learn enough about the characters - there was just too much fluff for me. Hope the next one is better...I really miss his early books...
1,I'm Trying To Think of Something Good To Say,"I can't find anything good to say about this book. I agree that it's tedious, boring and a waste of money. I put it down and picked it up and then asked myself 'why', closed it up and put it up. I was going to sell it here but everyone else who tried to read it beat me to it. It's not even worth the $.01."
4,New reader enjoyed this book!,"This is my first Johnathan Kellerman read. Although some of the other reviewers lamented over it not being one of his strongest, I enjoyed the audio immensely. It is not the most complex novel but I was entertained by the exchange between Milo and Alex. I will definately read Kellerman again and recommend him."
2,Engrossing!,"This book is quite good. Racy and a great time pass. In fact the 500 odd pages seem to quite less as words just simply flow through easily. A typical story of a dysfunctional family, it has tragedy mixed, with humor! Particularly the characterization of some wacky females!"
2,"Too much interview, not enough music","I should have read more reviews before getting too excited about this DOCUMENTARY. I had recently purchased some other rock DVD's where the songs were at least played in their entirety before the discussion ensued, AND there was a selection at the start of the DVD to only play the music and skip the documentary items. For this one, the song just gets started then it cuts to a lame set of interview respondants, no way to skip them. The fact that they are talking about Motorhead makes it at least worth hanging in there for awhile. 2 DVD's, why not play the whole song and then talk about it for petesakes?"
5,Instramentalist,"I love this Cd, I'm quite impressed how Tim used the Keyboard and turned it to a art form! mainly on the song ""Dear Jaquci"" very enchanting and mellow, i enjoyed it a lot!"
1,spurious,"I haven't heard this album, but I own a dodgy Hendrix CD with an identical track listing to disk 2. I'm not saying that some of it does not involve Jimi Hendrix. But, listening to these tracks made me very curious, and I found a very creditable website about Early Hendrix which says that 'Bring My Baby Back', 'Suspicious', 'Good Feeling' and 'Hot Trigger' are fakes, as in containing no involvement by Hendrix, just a 'lead guitar player playing ""Hendrix-style"".' In the case of 'Good Feeling', it's also singing 'Hendrix-style'. A bit lame and sad, unless you think it is an homage. Apologies to all if this is all genuine Hendrix, though I seriously doubt it. Track 15, for example, is the real deal. But, my feeling is that these 4 tracks, at least, are as phoney as a two-bob watch. The music on the 18 tracks on disc 2 is mostly pretty groovy, but I suggest you bear in mind that it might not all involve Jimi Hendrix playing."
1,bad news,This thing only shows part of the chords . The thing is defective. Did someone get a deal on defective items?
3,"Good, but easily breakable.","These sticks sounded nice, they played smooth and had little shock on the hands. After 1 and a half days of moderate use, they broke. The first one broke in half (the tip), then i was messing around (not playing very hard) and the other one cracked along the middle. If you can break a stick by hitting kind of hard on the soft side of a pad..... I dont think they are very durable. But overall they sounded amazing and were really fun to play with."
5,Origin in Death,"I have all the ""In Death"" series and this is the first one I have written a review on. This book really touched me because it shows how Eve and Roarke both are naive when it comes to children, family and familial love and they seemed more human. The end of the book was captivating and I really enjoyed enjoyed the human ending. Good book can't wait for the next one. Thanks JDR and Nora great series."
3,Political statement,"I was somewhat dissapointed in this book. I viewed it as Nora's view on cloaning. She makes a great point, but its not her usual style. Less about the caracters, and their lives, ect. Not as suspenseful and graphic as her normal. :("
3,Not her best,I love this series but this book was not as good as the others. Her plot was a little too sci-fi for my taste.
4,Origin of Death byJD Robb,"The story line is interesting and kept me intrigued. It had an unexpected twist, however in my opinion it is not one of her best writings."
4,Works well!,"Fits my 2007 F350 Standard Bed very good. Only complaint I have is the latches can be a little tight to open. I have found that if you push down on the corner a little, that does help with the latch.So far, the bed has stayed extremely dry, I am very pleased with that. When the full bed is needed, the cover rolls up easily, and the two velcro straps hold it rolled up very well.Pleased with the purchase, not too sure the more expensive covers would have been worth it."
5,This is a good book for those concerned about fat intake,"I really believe that most folks that are concerned about their diet should read this book. It has some very valuable information about dietary fat and the role that it plays in our bodies. It has been said that evolution has created a built in craving for fat which I think many of us can attest to, so if we are going to eat the stuff, we might as well try and eat the right kind of fat. The other thing is that I have found the only real way to stay on a diet is to include a properly balanced amount of protein and fat. This REALLY helps to stop the hunger pains and makes it possible to stay with your new eating program."
3,To much repetitive but still good...,"Well, I did like this book. However, it has a very inconvenient particularity: questions are so repetitive. I mean, for a patient description, two many questions were asked, of course, for different aspects of that particular patient. But it, then, moves away from the original purpose, which is to simulate, as much close as possible, the ""real-life"" aspects of USMLE test. Still, the CD-ROM that accompanies the book is not well formulated. It has the advantage of allowing to choose topics to study but it gets so boring when you try to simulate the 50-questions set of USMLE and it starts repeating questions all over again. So, please, take care when you buy this book: if you want to review by topics, good; if the purpose is to simulate USMLE, forget this book..."
3,A Great Idea,"The overall concept is a great one. It fits well in the hand and is well balanced. The only complaint I have is that the sliding mechanism isn't smooth, and I have problems keeping the blades in place."
4,I can describe Robyn's music in one word: FUNKY!,"""Show me love,"" one of Robyn's best songs, ruled the radio all summer, but still, I vote first for ""Do you know (what it takes)."" Robyn's powerful voice combined with funky beats makes this CD something to dance to! The A Cappella version of ""I wish"" is one of Robyn's surprises, besides the fact that she is white and Swedish. If they had a ""4 and a half"" stars, that's what I would have given ROBYN IS HERE, because this girl deserves it."
1,"Defective Product, no customer service","I received this DVD Recorder with a defective remote controller, so I have been unable to use it (no timer recording, no finalizing a disk). I have now spent three weeks communicating with automated voice mail trying to find out how to get the remote controller replaced, and sent five email messages, that have resulted only in receipt of another telephone number, resulting in no help. If anybody knows how to penetrate Panasonic's customer service morass, I would be eternally grateful"
2,Video output stopped working on two units,"I bought two of these. The S-Video and RCA-video outputs stopped working on each one after a month, one going completely black and the other losing horizontal sync. These units probably have very cheap integrated circuits in the output path. Best Buy let me exchange them, but I'm not confident that the replacements will last very long."
3,Reset Procedure,"if you lock playback to 0 -> Reset procedure: open dvd-tray. Press and hold record button. After you've pressed record, press and hold play button. Hold them both for about 5-7 seconds. After you let go, press eject and then open again. It should be ready for use."
1,"Irritating, aggrivating, tempermental, dust catcher.,","It is my opinion one star is really about two too many but they made me do it. I have two of these Panasonic crazy makers. An ES-20 and an ES-10. I've fought with both of them and missed numerous recordings over the last two and three years respectively. The absolute worst part is when they pretend to be recording and then crash at the end of the program. I bought the ES-20 when the ES-10 died and was sent it off for repair. I guess that equates to shooting myself in both feet. They have both been nothing but trouble. They are extremely tempermental. In fact, the ES-10 just quit recognizing the DVDRAM, grunts, groans displays self check, and refuses to open. Bottom line, I think this week I'm either going Tivo or Cable DVR. Maybe I can use these ""dvd recorders"" as wheel chocks."
3,Read this first!,"The Panasonic ES20 is a good DV recorder. Not finiky about blank quality, fairly intuitive. Lacks a few important features:1. No zoom. This means when you watch a movie you rented it is always in the narrow ""letterbox"" shape. No way to fill the screen.2. No Tv Guide feature3.No way to control your cable box from the DVR4.Will not tell you how much time remaining.Think long and hard before buying."
1,Plays my mind instead of my DVDs,"My wife and I have spent at least 5 hours trying to figure out why this thing operates the way it does. First, it more than occasionally locks up which requires you to unplug to correct; Second, it doesn't record based upon your scheduled setup...it either records early, not at all, or one day and not the next; Third, it will not play DVDs due to the Region Number mismatch even though there is an available menu option to play all DVDs (won't allow me to access this option). Need I say more? Don't waste your time on this one."
2,genev,"I found this entry to be an arduous endeavor to read. Thankfully, it was relatively short in length. The author spends most of his time quoting other people. One example: ""There was in the whole of the Old Testament from the patriarchal theophanies down to the latest prophetic visions, a constant current towards the incarnation as the goal of all these revelations."""
5,Excellent product,"Easy to install and works perfect. This is my second one, the first one is working for the past 2 years."
3,Disappointing,"Please check this book out at a library or local Girl Scout Council before buying! I was disappointed because I have been searching for quite some time for information regarding four Brownie badges that I earned in the 1970s, but can't remember what they were for or how I earned them. Although this book seems well-researched and is full of interesting and little-known facts, the information I seek was not included in this book or its predecessor. Since these badges were earned within the last 35 years, I was disappointed to find no mention of them, especially when the book includes such a wealth of information regarding previous decades."
1,A Fact-Free Diatribe,"In this weak and pointless polemic, the author treats the complex subject of dietary fat in just 3 pages. After assailing some of the scare-mongering about saturated fat, he vaciliates for several paragraphs about whether we should or should not worry. Finally, he concludes ""ancient wisdom has prescribed moderation."" ""We shouldn't be scaring ourselves to death over cancer,"" he proclaims, but rather ""thanking our scientists and physicians for allowing us to live longer."" I found this superficial and opinionated tract without merit."
1,Doesn't hold up,The second time I started useing this Crock-Pot the handles started to break off and by the time I finished cooking that second time the handle was completely broken off of the lid.<br />The worst part is I can't even return it because I recieved it as a Christmas gift and did not recieve a gift receipt.
1,Unhappy With the Product.,"Hello, I purchased the product a month ago in anticipation of a family get together. The next morning when I got the crockpot out to use it, I noticed that the top did not even fit on the pot, I know there must be a little room for steam to escape, but this was like a rocking chair. I have sent 4 unanswered emails to the company, no success. Here it is 2 months later and no response from the company. Please put your money towards a better constructed product with a company that will stand behind it."
2,Rocking Crock,"I purchased the crock-pot on sale at a local store and when it was opened on Christmas morning and set the crock into the heating unit it rocked. The lid fit well, but the crock rocked no matter which way it was placed in the heating unit. When I went to exchange the item, the store did not have any in stock, nor did any other store in the area. Now I loose the $5 I saved on the sale or hope a store receives a shipment in soon."
2,Watch out for the handle!,"This crock pot lasted a few years with no major incident, I would not recommend it because of the poor quality. We would use it once about one a month and the last time was quite a disaster. The lid (like so many other people report) fell off while food was cooking. Plastic pieces went everywhere and needless to say it was quite a hazard. This appears to be a common problem and you would be best looking at another brand/model."
5,More bang for your buck,"I didn't purchase my Rival slow cooker from Target. I bought mine off E-bay, but the design is identical from the one that Target sells. I have to say that Rival is a VERY good name in Kitchen equipment. I use mine when ever I don't feel like turning on a hot oven in the summer time. It's very user friendly and it does was the company says. Even though I didn't buy it retail, I still recomend it to anyone that wants a relieable cooker. For those who have bad luck with it remember this. Mass production does have it's flaws remember that. I for one have had no bad luck with the glass lid for any reason."
1,Antivibe? Ringing drives me nuts!,"First, this is a very comfortable hammer (grip, balance, and easy on the elbow). The comfort comes at the expensive of keeping the vibration in the hammer.After every strike, the hammer continues to ring for a few seconds. I thought I had a 5 star hammer until I helped a friend build a shed. My elbow felt great, but the continuous ringing for 2 days was enough to drive me insane! Even my friend was affected by the ringing while working several feet away.He had the 20-ounce Antivibe and it does not experience any ringing. I headed to Lowes to buy a new hammer and tested these two models in the store. I sampled several of the Antivie hammers on the shelf and the 16oz/20oz ringing/not ringing held true.If you can handle the extra weight, the 20oz Antivibe is a great hammer. It dampens the vibrations in a split-second. If you need a 16oz, I'd continue to look elsewhere if you need to drive more than a dozen nails per project."
5,Much better than the 22-oz. version,"Although others have mentioned the longer handle on this 16-oz. version (compared to the claw hammer), it does allow plenty of room to choke up on it to strike the right balance. Unlike the 22-oz. version, this one was easier for me to handle throughout the day. Most of the time I'm driving either 1.5-2"" finish nails or 3.5"" framing nails for various projects. This works great. Thanks Stanley!"
4,canon strap+battery grip=good combo,"the official canon stuff may cost a little (or a lot) more than some of the cheap knock-off stuff, but the quality is much better. i had an aftermarket non-canon strap before and this one is much better, feels nice around my wrist and seems a lot more of a positive grip which makes me worry less about my camera. i think its worth spending a few bucks more to worry less and have things that just work how they should."
5,Great add-on for extra battery pack.,I use this handstrap with my 20D when I have the extra battery pack attached and it's great.Highly recommended.
3,OOPs. No battery grip.,"This item is very well mad and comfortable against my hand. The problem is that I have a different brand battery grip. I should have read the other reviews before ordering because the need for a Canon battery grip was not mentioned in the description of the item. Lesson learned - research thoroughly before purchasing....Still trying to find a way to attach it... Yeah, I know - sad."
2,"Some good, some bad points","Well, I haven't broken it yet, that's the good thing. I like the kind of string they use and it seems to pass through the tip easy enough.Things I like about this chalk line:- sometimes quick rewind- good hook...not all chalk lines have a good hook- good string- nice grip...well, ok, its got rubber on the sides, a bit of an overkill to meeThings I don't like:- Its huge...most chalk lines are much smaller and take up less space in my belt.- that pop-out rewinder handle...takes too long to get it out- the lock...doesn't work consistantly...most lines you can just set the handle and it locks, not this one- the gears don't like to work when you first fill it up...maybe it can take 4 oz of chalk, but it won't rewind with that much in it!"
2,"Too many tools, too little money.","What most of the reviewers say is true.-Difficult to wind when loaded with chalk. Stanley's claim that it will hold a 4 oz bottle of chalk is correct, but you won't want to use it that way. The chalk gets in the plastic gears. It works best when the level of the chalk is low enough that the chalk falls away from the gears.-The string is tough but leaves a fat line. When I originally got mine, the string was tangled up inside. I had not expected a problem with a new tool (always the optimist), so I immediately filled it with 4 oz of chalk. When I couldn't get the string out, you can believe me that I pulled hard to ""resolve"" that problem, and to my amazement nothing broke. I had to take the new reel apart to fix the problem.-I will be using my old Strait-Line reel."
2,BORING!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!,I was looking to find out about the Bichon Frise. Not all the dogs. It did talk about the history but some of the sections explained about all dogs. I was looking for a book about the the cute fluffy dogs I know!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
3,"Certainly not ""Professional""","Followed all instructions to the letter. To be safe, allowed the finish to dry and cure for over four days. The end result was beautiful and I was extremely pleased. Unfortunately, after about three months it started showing signs of hot tire marks (which it is not supposed to do) A few weeks later the hot tire marks started to peel off and actually stick to my tires! Now I have four bare spots, NO finish left at all, where the tires are. The rest of the floor still looks great. Not worth buying another kit to repair the bare spots. E-mailed Rust-Oleum about the problem and have never had a response. So much for the warranty!"
1,crappy stuff,"this dvd player though seems good from the looks of it and features is crappy as it comes. it does not recognize my external HDD (seagate maxtor) . the remote is really poor, no eject button! the damn player hangs when its not able to read a dvd and i have to plug out the thing to get it restarter.. all in all total waste of money"
3,Philips in general,"in my experience with phillips dvd players I will tell you only get them if they are a crazy deal. I got one just recently from best buy, tons of features good price, the thing died before I could play one movie. I do not know about this exact player, however I am in the market for a new DVD player with HDMI, and I will not be buying this one. Philips has good pricing, features, picture quality, however they go kopow very quickly. I have not read a recent review (in the last 2 years) of a philip customer whose philips actually still work."
5,Very good DVD excellent relation price versus quality,"Very good DVD excellent relation price versus quality, spetially if you are looking for a DVD with HDMI out.It arrived in time and works perfect with my DELL 17"" computer monitor I connected it to the DVD with a HDM to DVI cable (not included)also available in Amazon (Cables Unlimited, HDmi To Dvi-d Cable, 6ft)"
2,Aggravating,"This dvd player is painfully slow. Say you want to watch a dvd... I hit the open button, but this is disabled. Okay, hit the power button. Then hit the open button. No, it's thinking. Hit the open button again. Wait, hit it over and over. Okay, you finally got the thing open. Put in the disc. Sit down and grab the tiny cheap remote. Press play. It can't see the remote -- there's a slight angle to where you're sitting. Stretch your arm way out to the side, take careful aim, and YES, you got a response. Watch for a while, and pause it to make popcorn. It turns off after a while. You turn it back on, and it has NOT saved your previous location. Arghh!"
4,Great buy,This DVD has it all - I love using the USB feature for Divx movies. I bought 2 of these unit from 2 different sources. Just make sure you shop around because local store can also price match the online price.
3,Looking for DTS and DIVX Ultra support..not here,"I've been looking around for a unit that is DIVX Ultra certified and doesDTS. Haven't found one yet. From what I found out, the DTS signal is not passed thru the unit. Apparently has something to do with the chipset used in this unit...still looking"
1,Spend the extra $40 and get the Sony,"I have the Sony on one TV and decided to try this one out on my other TV. Bad idea. Within 2 days it was choking on all kinds of discs. Plus, it's a pain that it doesn't do something as simple as remember where you left off when you stop a disc. The Sony remembers up to 7 discs so even if you stop a movie halfway through, watch 5 others movies and pop it back in a month later it can remember where you were. Seems minor but you don't miss it until you have this DVD player. Also, the sound was so muted I had to turn the TV volume up to twice what I do for cable. The picture is good but overall the Sony is a much better option at $40. Lucky for me, Amazon is a breeze to deal with on returns."
4,Pretty good DVD player for a reasonable price,"This was bought for a college apartment, and we're fairly happy with it. The USB port easily recognized an iPod and a thumb drive, but doesn't support any of the other external hard drives in our house. Also, while the codecs for .avi files performed well, the player didn't recognize .mpg files. Plays DVD movies nicely. The remote is a little difficult to use though, it needs to be pointed directly at the system. All in all a decent player for the price."
4,Great for the price,"Plays divx/mpeg and probably some other formats, but no wma, which is fine. I like the USB port, so you can just copy some files to a memory stick and plug it right it and an play on the TV. Does a good job at formatting non DVD formats to fit the TV. Takes a little too long to turn on and it's annoying that you can't open the DVD tray if it's in sleep mode - you have to wait for it to boot. DVDs look fine, however - not a high end player by any means, but if this is in your market, you're probably working on a budget, and for the money, this more than delivers. Recommended."
1,Bummer -does not play multi-region DVDs,Despite the description given here the thing takes only Region Code 1 (USA & Canada) DVDs. Forget it.
4,Our DVDs have a new life!,"Like most of you, we're waiting for Blu-Ray to come down in price and become more prevalent at Blockbuster, etc. We bought a 37"" 720p set last year and decided to get this in the interim. Wow, what a difference over the standard DVD player we had hooked up. Looks great with included component video cables. Using HDMI now (no huge improvement over component).The price is right too, so why only 4 stars? Its slow loading tray and lack of any unique feature (back-lit remote for example) keep it from being perfect."
2,It takes 1 hour of reading to extract 5 minutes of value!,Some good information. The problem is that I had to do so much skimming to get to anything useful it was unbelieveable. Such a waste of paper. I don't know what some of those other reviewers were thinking about. Then when I finally found the useful information it takes you 10 excrutiatingly long chapters later to figure out what to do with the information. In my opinion your better off getting your copywriting information from another author. I've made the mistake of buying other books from him and he uses the same wasteful and frankly very egotistical style. He thinks he's the only one who knows how to market or one of the few. I am an avid reader of marketing books and I feel you'll be better off somewhere else. I'm sorry I wasted my money on his books.
3,Self promotional to the point of silliness,"Right at the start he states that he will use the book to push his own services.He's not kidding.I feel almost guilty reviewing a book I didn't finish reading - but that I just couldn't finish a book by a pro' copywriter speaks for itself. He constantly informs you, dear reader, that you're just not customer focussed enough. No, you're not. Really, you're really not customer focussed enough. Not at all. You should be more like him, because he IS customer focussed, see? Do you get it yet? You're not customer focussed enough. Unlike him. Perhaps you should hire a professional, someone who is customer focussed enough? Because you, why you're just not customer focussed enough. Not at all. Unlike him... Zzzzzzzzzzz....No, that's not just the 1st chapter, I was 2/3 through when I just gave up on it.Don't waste your money. If you want to know how great he is, send him an email. Tell him you're not customer focussed enough."
1,Worst flash drive ever,I bought this because of the low price and small form factor - and will be returning it because it is almost unusable. This is possibly even slower than a USB 1 device. It took 5 minutes to copy 20 megs of data. Even doing a full format and defrag on the disk didnt help. AVOID!!!
5,excellent introduction,"This is a really well written book that does a great job of explaining how political scientists try to make sense out of politics. It is full of interesting stories and examples, offers understandable explanations of major concepts, and it connects the reader to many of the current events in the world."
1,Failed to operate,"I ordered a Pet Agree based on positive reports from acquaintances, and witnessed results. I did not receive a Pet Agree (although that was what was confirmed on my order). I received a substitute item. The substitute item failed to operate/function. I tried installing a new battery. It still failed. I contacted the supplier, reporting the item did not operate and requesting to return it (or exchange). I never received a reply. Therefore, I am disappointed and I cannot say anything positive about this experience except it was received in a timely manner."
1,Waste of money....,"It doesn't work....sometimes it does, most of the time it doesn't. It worked for about three days and then all of a sudden stopped working after we had it for about a month. We only use it when necessary but unfortunately right now it is completely useless and the batteries work fine. I also do NOT recommend for house with indoor cats."
4,Great for certain dogs,Here's the deal --- Bought this for our ShiChon and it works like a charm. LOVE it!Two years later we get a Yorkie and the Yorkie doesn't even flinch when we press the button.Luckily -- it still works for the other dog.So - I'm guessing it depends on the dog and their range of hearing... and maybe how high pitch their bark is too!
3,Started out working,When we first got it our dog stopped barking because she didn't know what it was. When she got used to it she still kept barking.
5,Perfect for my dogs and my neighbor dog,"This device truly curbs excessive barking and is a useful training tool. I used to shake a soup can with pennies in it (which worked wonderfully) but it hurt my ears in the process! I now use this device to re-enforce my dogs to ""no bark"" and have now been able to just ""show"" the device to my four dachshunds and they respond desirably. Where this device has shined is in curbing the excessive barking of my neighbor's frequently unattended Jack Russell. When speaking to the neighbor proved unsuccessful, I felt that I needed to take matters into my own hands. I can stand on my deck and point to my neighbor's yard (about 50 ft away) and press the device. It's unfortunate that the dog is left unattended frequently, but it has allowed us to sleep without the dog barking and minimize the noise during the day."
1,Useless Product,"I bought this product thinking that it would help.To say the least it is a waste of money and completely useless. I didn't send it back because I misplaced the box it came in and the receipt, I still have it and it was a waste of time and money."
5,Worked well for us!,"We have two barky Beagles that set each other off continuously. No amount of scolding, swatting, cold water spraying or ""time-outs"" in the house seemed to work. The first day I used this product it worked. They stopped barking immediately and went to another room and sat quietly until I said 'Come.' After using it for several days the word ""stop"" became meaningful to them. Now, if I can't find the device, all I have to do is say ""stop"" and point the remote control, cell phone, or garage door opener at them and they ceased barking. I still carry it when I take them for walks, Just in case."
2,would not recommend,"Unless this is attached to your hip at all times ( it does have a clip for such a purpose ) you have to search for it as soon as the dog starts barking.I bought it for my older dog who is 3 and she does not really care about it, but the younger pup comes running. The question I have also and it might be a stupid one....how do I know when it runs out of batteries! :)"
1,Not Satisfied,This product did not turn out to be what I was hoping for. Our dog is not at all affected or reactive to the device. The sound is of a higher frequency but is very audible to the human ear. I just sent it back for a return yesterday.
1,HATE IT,"This doesn't work at all. The first time I used it my dog looked at me as if to say ""Are you serious?"". I swear I could hear her laugh behind my back. Get the cheaper and more effective ""Pet Corrector"". That works."
1,Worthless..,"I only gave it 2 stars because I dont like to use the word ""hate"". But this product did not work at all. At one point, I could even hear my neighbor's dog laughing at me.."
1,Didn't work on my dogs,"I have 2 jack/chis that bark at people it worked on the boy dog for a couple days but then he started ignoring it completely. My girl never responded at all to it, completely ignored it from the start. I had high hopes because my mom bought one for her 2 dashunds and they responded well at first, which is why I placed an order for this product. But just like my dog within 2 weeks they stopped responding. I thought maybe the battery was low and replaced it just in case but no luck."
4,Pet Agree Ultrasonic Trainer,This works very well and for the price we paid we feel we got our money's worth.I would recommend this to all who have crazy barking dogs in your house or your neighbors dog.
4,It works for the most part.,"This device catches the attention of my dogs. It does not make a dramatic difference. If they're really determined to bark at someone, they continue to do so. But, if I have this device in my hand, and I come into my living room with it (which is where they usually are when they're barking so excessively), and they see it in my hand, they will usually stop the barking. When they're not extremely excited, and I use it to stop their barking, it seems to work.I am happy with it. Some of the other devices advertised here, showed reviewers that indicated that those devices were extremely hard on their dogs, making their dogs cower for long periods of time. I didn't want that. This device has helped a lot."
2,Doesn't work for my dog,"My 5 month golden doodle is not bothered by this at all, still jumps on my counters. Trying a shock collar and getting better results."
2,Disappointing,"I found this device not to work most of the time. I have a Yorkie and he is distracted for a moment and then goes back to his barking. It is difficult to grab it from a pocket and know right away which side should be toward the dog. It seems heavy and awkward to hold. I would return it, but it would cost too much."
1,Worthless,Complete and total waste of money. Dogs look at and keep right on barking. Would return but cannot find box.
2,Did not work for me,"Bought it to use it on neighbor dogs. Maybe our distance is too far, but it seems to have no effect at all. I tried it from our bedroom with windows open which can be as far as 20ft plus from the dogs. The dogs are great dane and basset hound."
2,Worked for a two weeks only!,"Worked great for 2 weeks, then my dog couldn't care less if you pressed it. Maybe I over used it. but after reading more reviews it seems common. My dog reacts better to the $3 clicker i purchased."
1,Has no effect on my dog,"I could his attention easier by waving a flashlight at him. A complete waste of my money, I've already thrown it out!"
2,does not work,"Do not waste your money on it. Did not work and I have 6 dogs, no results at all, invest money in training."
1,K-li Enterprises Pet-Agree Dog Training Aid Ultrasonic,This product did not work well for me at all. Maybe I was using it wrong. I don't know. But I wasn't satisfied with it at all.
1,RATE IT,Item does not work. My dog did not react to the ultasonic sound. Changing the battery did not help either.
2,"Works for a few days, waste of money",The dogs responded to it for a few days then they were able to ignore it. Don't waste your money.
5,Ouch,"I haven't yet tried this on a cat or dog, but the incredibly high pitched sound is quite uncomfortable when I aim it at myself. They advertise that humans can't hear it, but I can. I do have tinnitus, so maybe this explains it. There are quite a few nuisance dogs in my neighborhood, I feel more confident having this with me."
2,An old book in a tattered cover.,"It looks like an interesting book, but is not the hard-back cover book I had ordered and expected to get in the mail."
4,Norah can do no wrong,"If you liked her debut release, you will also enjoy this unauthorized release. Despite the fact that she didn't support the release of this work, I was Jonesing for new material from her, and felt compelled to take a listen.These tracks are strong, her voice is as captivating as always, and these songs are perhaps 'jazzier' and display her versatility between different genres.Can't wait to hear the next Norah offering."
4,"Little short, but it's good","While this is a pretty good cd, the length is a little disappointing. I've bought this for the family members who love Nora Jones, and they've liked it a lot. So I guess that if you love Nora Jones, length isn't a problem. I will say though, her voice is amazing and I love listening to her, so I would recommend this to anyone who likes jazz and Jones."
5,How to fall in love with a voice,"Ok, I must admit, before buying this CD I never actually listened to Norah, even though I was aware she was a good singer. But one day I walked into a music store and the CD was playing in the background. The music had a nice bluesy feel and the singer was just amazing, and so I asked the guy behind the counter what was playing. I decided to take the CD home with me. I fell in love with Norah's voice, it gives so much heart to the music that Malick wrote down. Malick may not be an extraordinary blues player (sorry, all my votes go to Clapton and friends here), but the music has a very nice feel. The title track is beautiful and sets the right tone for the rest of the album. Wrapping it up: this is a very good album, for Norah or blues fans, and deserves a place in your big CD collection."
5,Very Great Combination....,"I'm from The Philippines, and honestly, I didn't know who are The Peter Malick Group. I'm a big fan of Norah Jones, so I decided to buy it. Before listening to this album, I was suspecting that this album will not be that good, because as far as I know, The Peter Malick group's songs are more upbeat than that of Norah Jones. But after I listened the album, I realized that I made a bad judgement the time before I listened to this album. Their combination in this album is perfect. Norah Jones proved that her outstanding skills is not just for the blues, but she could do just everything. What are you waiting for? Buy it now. There'll be no money regrets - I assure you that...."
4,"Great, but short.","The songs are wonderful. Norah is, as always, wonderful. But the CD has so few songs that you're left wanting more. That's a good thing, but seven songs is rather ridiculous."
2,Disapointing Release,"Nothing of Norah's is bad, but don't waste you money on this one. It has 7 songs and two are duplicates. Go for her new one, Feels Like Home."
1,Sell Out,"I was disappointed. Norah's first album was original, and pure. It seamed to avoid even the appearance of commercial music. This ""New York City"" sounds like radio music. I feel cheated by hearing her dark and lusty voice behind such a blended band. It is like pop music, that it never seams to go anywhere, or at least looses my attention before hand.""Come Away With Me"" was made purely for the love of music. This seams to be about something much less rewarding. Something we see too much of these days. I am disappointed. If you liked ""Come Away With Me"", you'll hate ""New York City"". Please Norah, please make some more good music. We don't need anymore pop divas. We need Norah Jones."
4,Norah sings the blues; Peter plays guitar,"The word is that these recordings have sat on the shelf for 3 years. The success of Norah Jones forced the music to be brought out. Well, I'm glad it has now seen the light of day! Norah's singing is even more spontaneous and open on these blues flavored tunes than on her own CDs. And while I admit I would not have purchased the album if not for Norah's involvement, I also enjoyed Mr. Malick's guitar playing. He can be subtle when the song calls for it (""Strange Transmissions"") and then cut loose on something like the Stones-ish ""Things You Don't Have To Do.""I thought Ms. Jones sounded a little like Janis Joplin before, but with this material the resemblance is even more noticeable. She has a true knack for the blues, and it's great to hear this slightly different side of her talents. If you're a fan of Norah's music, get this CD. You won't be disappointed!"
4,Tain!,"Well, I never saw Tain with Wynton, but I have seen him with Branford many times, and I always love it. But somehow, I think my favorite Tain on record is here, especially the title track. The Branford records are good too, but this has a ""rawer"" feeling to me somehow...it is too bad Wynton went Dixieland shortly after this.(There is the great ""Blues Alley"" album with this band, too.)"
5,Useful pocketknife,"About as long as a key although thicker, this pocketknife clips onto my keychain where it's always handy. Quality construction. The tools are practical and really work. I use the knife and scissors several times a week to open packages and to trim loose threads and such. I've used the LED flash a couple of times to view hard-to-reach spots in poor light, and have even used the pen.I recommend this Midnite Manager Pocketknife if you are looking for a handy knife and tool to keep with you."
5,Excellent scholarly work on the Qur'an,"An excellent introduction to western scholarship on the subject. It's useful to read this together with Fazlur Rahman's ""Major Themes in the Qur'an"", which is in many respects a Muslim response to Watt and Bell.Interestingly, the excellent work that Bell and Watt do in locating the Qur'an within the context of Muhammad's life actually tends to refute the work of more radical scholars such as John Wansbrough and Patricia Crone, who claim that the Qur'an was produced in the second or third century of Islam."
2,Death in the Saddle (Bonus Content),"This is not a full episode of the TV show Bones, as I was expecting. It is just a short little bonus content thing that isn't worth wasting the time it takes to download it and then watch it."
3,Good Read but Biased,I enjoyed reading this book although it is not a biography at all. The book is well written but perhaps from a very partial viewpoint. I would have liked a little more investigative type journalism.
5,love this persons product line,I have all Anne Burnell's DVD products - II find her easy to follow and get a lot of the exercises - fro Yoga to Core to Stretches to Strength - ALL Good - will buy any new DVD in her line
5,"Practical, portable","I also own a XPS 12.1"", and it fits perfectly, including all wires and cables. It's a solution to those who already own a confortable regular backpack but do not want to buy a laptop-customized backpack. I am very satisfied."
2,bad shipping department!,"The spindle of the disk pack was broken when i received the package, there wasn't any cushioning, or filler of any kind in the box, so far all the disk that i've recorded appears to work.. there should be padding used when shipping anypackage;"
5,Work as expected,"I noticed some negative reviews from high-speed, high-volume copying users. I do a few CD's here and there and these are working fine for me and my iMac. They print fine and copy well. No problems for the light to medium volume copier."
3,Recording issues,"In duplicating music CD's with a robot duplicator, there was a very high reject rate, averaging 10 to 15% on 3 packs of 100. When I switched back to Taiyo Yuden CD's, there were no rejects. The price of the Maxell CD's was a little lower than Taiyo Yuden, but in the end they were more expensive because of the high reject rate."
5,A HOUSE CALL FOR HAIR,"Southwest sun can take its baking toll on hair unless you're wise and usually wear a hat. (I'm not wise and I don't really care for hats. Every once in a while there's an errant breeze during the summer months, and it feels good touching and lifting your hair) Now, I've accepted the blame for often dry lackadaisical locks, what's the solution?For me, Fekkai's Glossing Cream with its addition of pure olive oil delivers shine, hydration and manageability. It comes in the trademark Fekkai tube (easy to squeeze with wet hands).Since my hair is fine and fly-away it works best for me if I rub a small amount between my palms on towel dried hair and stroke through. Then I repeat the process after blow drying and before styling.It's incredibly light yet effective. Fekkai is simply the finest!"
4,Nice shine and feels silky,"I am a BZZ agent and received a sample of the glossing cream to try and review. i have very thick hair with a wave underneath and highlights. After using the shampoo/conditioner I tried this on wet and dry hair. I felt it made my hair a little limp. it did add a nice shine. Perhaps I used too much. I will keep trying to perfect it, as I do like the product and I do live in the south. This will come in handy this summer I am sure!"
1,Don't waste your money,The scent in this eau de parfum spray is so faint and evaporates to nothing in record time. I would NEVER buy this fragrance again.
5,Smells soo good,"I'm fiancee was in love with it, ever since she received it for Christmas, she's been spraying it on her."
4,"Good for learning, not for reference","This is a good book to use if this is your first introduction to programming in LISP. Although some of the examples are a bit elementary, it is a good introduction to the language. The most frustrating thing is trying to use the book as a reference. The index is poor and due to the book's organization it makes looking up things a nightmare. If you're going to buy this book, buy a good reference book to go with it."
3,Needed more time on the editor's desk,"I'm a big fan of Donaldson's generally but I was a bit disappointed by this book. I concur with prior reviews that he was likely trying to educate newer readers, but the result was a retread of the previous books, thematically and otherwise. For instance, Linden's struggles trying to access her power was (likely on purpose) identical to Covenant's in the first series. Did anyone else feel her recovery of the staff of law came too easily? I recommend the book, but am hopeful that the next few books display more originality."
3,Mithil Stonedown Board of Education rules11,"Didja notice that everyone in this book speaks like a college professor? I liked the story (it is just a story folks...) but reaching for the dictionary in every chapter is a bit tiring. I'd have to say that this is the biggest part that I had to overcome to achieve any semblance of ""suspension of belief"". Everyone besides Linden and, possibly, the Masters should speak a bit more plainly."
2,"The Runes of the Earth (The Last Chronicles of Thomas Covenant, Book 1)","I only recommend this book if you want a follow-up to the first two trilogies other wise it takes forever to get up to speed with all of the important caricatures in the story.I waited until this set of books was complete before purchasing this book, cause the author takes forever to finish his books. Last time I picked up one of his books (10+ years ago) I do not remember him using so many unusual words (read the kendal version it has a built in Thesaurus) that part seemed silly. In my opinion the author spends to much time with descriptions of what is going on in his caricatures heads.My mistake he has not finished the last book of this set. be out sometime this year 2013."
2,The Chronicles of WHO?,"Lets be blunt about this, I am without doubt the biggest fan of SRD going and have been from the beginning but as my old dad used to say if it walks,and sounds like a duck it probably is and what this novel isn't is a Chronicle of Thomas Covenant!This may be a socially correct extension of a previously sucessful storyline but it is not part of the greatest fantasy series ever written. The reason the Land exists is Thomas Covenant,not supporting characters. The reason the fans have elevated this series above all others is the love and respect of its main character, to attempt to extend the story without ite heart rings hollow indeed. Congratulations on a wonderful story that would have been more honestly titled Further Adventures in The Land it may have made less money but it would have offended less fans."
3,Of course I had to read this new book,"Having read the other Covenant books and loved them, I, of course had to get The Runes of the Earth. Maybe Donaldson waited so long to continue the story because he feared living up to the old series. Unfortunately, this book is not nearly as great as the old series. I know that inevitably readers will compare the books and not look at Runes in its own right, but that is just how it is. It has been a while since I read the old series, probably more than awhile (24 years ago is when I read Lord Fouls' Bane)but this book seems like it has a whole lot of talk and not nearly enough action. Anyway, it is good enough to keep me reading and I will get the next books in the series too, because the Land is just too good to read about even if it does not live up to the old series."
5,A Strong Guy's Watch,"I have been a former G-Shock watch user and I have several in my collection, however I know that Timex has been a great brand of sports watches for many years, so I looked into the new 30-lap Ironman watch. When I received it I was very surprised to see how ""beefy"" it was as well as being pretty stylish for a sports watch. Its shock resistant body is similar to G-Shock and should be rugged enough to ""follow me around"". I also need the 2 time zones feature because I travel to China and do business there, so I always know what time it is there, and when I am there I know what time it is here in the central time zone......Right now it is my favorite watch and I am wearing it now!!"
2,Timex Too Big,"This watch face is huge. It stands approximately one half inch deep. When I bend my wrist it digs into my forearm. The ""Flix"" system is a joke. I have to give my wrist whiplash to get it to light up. Then its hard to see because it has to be pitch black to see Indiglo face. I do like the Velcro band because it is big enough to fit my wrist. Unless you like big bulky watches look elsewhere. Sorry Timex."
2,Reference Only,Teach Yourself LotusScript is OK as an additional reference for your library. It may give you some additional tips that you may not get from the Lotus Help Files.As far as an instructive guide for learning script is concerned it is a little light on.If your after a true instructive guide to learning script - there are probably better books out there.....
3,Good if you're familiar with OOP,"Before reading this book I was just familiar with Notes Programming Basics and Formula Language. I didn't Have any experience with Lotus Script or VB or anything that way. In such a case, this book won't help you too much, but all the other books also don't. But If you're willing to take the hard way, you will find anything in this book that you need to know. It is written in a style that is as easy to understand as possible. I did not find a better one, although I can imagine better ones."
2,"Not horrible, but not worth it either","I teach leadership skills, from a Christian perspective, and I thought this book would be great. I was wrong. Much of the book is good and pithy. However, the book is extremely basic. She couldn't get too in depth with 3 page chapters. Some of her theology is less than sound. I read the book, and got some good points; but in the end, I returned the book to the store. It's the first time I've ever returned a book, but this book wasn't worth the money."
3,contradiction,"While I find this book to be very insightful into the way one SHOULD lead their executive and business lives. The fact that Jesus was a leader but only to those who followed his public humiliation, spearing, and crucifixion brings into doubt the potency of his leadership qualities in today's society where contrarians are also left crucified.While I am a devout Christian, and believe in his leadership for those who followed him, I certainly do not want to be a martyr in my executive or business life. Moreover, Jesus was not on the mission to which Ms. Jones prescribes -- he died for sins, and in that way could not exercise leadership which would allow him to accomplish the mission Ms. Jones prescribes but did allow him to complete his real mission -- singularly and not in a leadership role.Living as a Christian does not mean that I must be crucified too - Christ did that for me.In sum, a little impractical in the physical world in which we live.Regards.Jason at Yale University"
4,Jesus CEO,"This book is a very easy read, inspirational and helpful. Whether you are in business for yourself or working for someone else, the principles laid out in the book applies. I especially like the thought-provoking questions at the end of each chapter."
4,SWV's Sexiest LP,"The last LP that groups put out is usually sub-par, but not this one. Man, half of the songs are built for having one-on-one time with a special someone, and I'm not mad at that. All the girls lead off, and they hold their own quite well."
5,JUST RIGHT,"This model is exactly what i was hoping for.While not as powerful as the 12 amp model, It gets the job done while being a bit lighter in the weight department which is what i was looking for.This makes it more maneuverable for me & the wife likes it also."
4,"Good blower, okay vacuum","The two-speed blower works very well - the leaf vacuum doesn't have the same power. All things being equal, this yard tool works as described and has been reliable - the shoulder strap, however, is awkward and very uncomfortable despite being adjustable."
5,FUNNY AS HELL,"This is one of feotus's best. Unique funky slammin goofy sick and dark. It's really too bad feotus never got with the hip hop program, he really could have schooled some heads.Modern goth gets it all wrong.Any fan of rob zombie hellbilly delux should check this cd out and see what the real thing sounds like.if you like this cd, check out bug tapping the conversation for the some new school stumbo.The other wiseblood isn't as good but it's got one track thats so slammin that its worth 10 or 15 bucks just to own it. for real."
5,Adorable Toy,"I ordered the FurReal cat without seeing it in person. It is a little smaller than I expected, but the quality is wonderful. It is soft and cute, and it is very easy for young children to press the back of the cat to make it knead and meow. My little niece will love it."
3,Good value,"These knives were a great price, so I jumped on them. I bought them as a present for my girlfriend. They are not as durable as my previous Henckel knives. The blades are really light and flex and the handles are a little light. For the price though, they are really a good option. I think I will purchase a more durable and stronger set, but use these for back up for picnics and camping."
4,Very tasty and easy,"This is a great, low-fat way to prepare chicken, and is great with an Asian style cucumber salad on the side. It is not, however, spicy at all. It is sweet and delicious, but could use a little more spice. I recommend pounding the chicken breasts before you coat them in the peanut mixture. If you do not overcook them, they come out perfectly juicy and delicious every time."
4,Lefty Nails It,"Lefty and his misfit roofing crew not only repair roofs against all odds, they also kept me laughing and crying. They prevail despite poor equipment, rabid raccoons, and unrequited love. Although I couldn't stop reading it, I hated it to end. I am waiting for the sequel!"
4,I am happy with this product,I am happy with this product. It is exactly what I expected! I think the price is right for the quality of this item.
4,Almost Perfect Feeder,This feeder is perfect for smaller birds which is what I intended it for since I have a platform feeder for my Cardinals. It has attracted a yellow finch and some other small birds like titmice and some birds I have yet to identify. You do have to fill it all the way up for both perches to get used and that takes a lot of feed. You can only use sunflower seeds because the smaller seed will fall out of the mesh. I haven't had any squirrels get in it but I have a baffle under it. If you want to attract Cardinals or larger birds this is not the feeder for you. The cardinals are to big for the distance between the perch and the food. They try but ultimately fall off and use the platform feeder. All in all this is a sturdy feeder and looks like it will last several years.
5,Great,"WOW. enough said...but i'll still say more. They are great. They have a good hand grip, strong hold on whatever you are pliering, and even have a handy wirecutter that i wasn't expecting. If you have small hands i'd sugest a smaller one though because these are quite big, i like the size though."
1,Book in limbo???,When ordering textbooks online I didn't realize that this was being ordered from Europe!! May have only been $1.77 but it apparently is being mailed on the Titanic. I still don't have it and daughter's class started today. :(
2,Somewhat pointless Batman/Ra's story!,"I'm not sure if this was released when Batman Begins came out just to give new readers a look at Ra's al Ghul but this really missed the mark. I don't know why this was titled Year One because lacks everything that some of the great Year One stories had. Batman is faced with a crazy plot about death no longer existing and he solves it without batting an eye, no pun intended. Now, is that because Batman is the best or because of sloppy unimaginative writing? I'm guessing the latter. The only thing that keeps this book above 1 star was the phenomenal art by Paul Gulacy. He's able to draw Batman completely classic and modern at the same time. Excellent work on his part. Sadly he had to deal with this script. If interested in Ra's al Ghul or Batman fighting the supernatural, there are far better collections than these meek one."
3,A decent read,Very insightful and an eclectic collage of speeches and musings. Many stories are repeated and his writing jumps around a bit before he gets to his point.An amazing man with even more amazing perspective - you just need your waders.
2,I should have stopped at Sunwing. . .,"I read this one because I fell in love with Shade in Marina when I first read Silverwing. I read Sunwing too, and was still impressed. But Firewing was horrible! I was an extra to the two books before it. Shade found his father, Goth is suppoedly dead, Zotz is gone and Shade and Marina are together. So what's left??Oppal threw in this thing with the UnderWorld and Griffen. I didn't expect this one to end with a mini cliffhanger. I won't give it away because it would ruin reading the thing, but come on!"
1,Beeswax Crafting,It was not helpful to me at all. What I needed was how to process the wax that had been sold to me by the beekeeper to make the candles. It was still in the raw form. I needed to know how to seperate the wax from the sediment.
4,pretty good,I read this a few months ago. I can't remember too much about it but i know it was'nt that bad.
2,Warranty,Received product in working condition around Nov. 9th. 2012. On Dec. 17th. 2012 thermostat went out. Sent email to seller. Warrantly with seller was 30 days. Contacted Bunn and gave them the requested serial number. Turns out the coffee brewer was manufactured in Oct. 2010 and sent to Sam's. The warrantly with Bunn is 2 years parts and 1 year labor. The very kind representative is sending another thermostat at no charge.
3,LASKO 7600 CYCLONIC CERAMIC HEATER,"I had misunderstood the product description, thinking that this heater could be set for a in-future turn-on. It couldn't. I was able to turn it on to a low heat before I went to bed, run it overnight and then turn the heat up when I awoke. This was a good substitute, but I am so far unable to determine how much extra electricity this uses. There has not been enough time yet for me to tell how adequate the heater is in other respects. I was also not clear about how to register this product: I was pleased with how quickly LASKO responded to my call and explained that this was only for marketing purposes and that the warranty(not indicated in Amazon's ad) was for 3 yrs."
4,Heats up a room quickly!!,I live in Alaska and I use this heater in my spare room which is a converted garage. After about an hour of continuous operation you can get by with just a longsleeve shirt.
3,OK,Bought to be an accessory heater for a room that gets cold. Runs all the time to keep the room at 64F in my house.....not what I thought I was buying.
2,Not as effective as desired,This product does not provide as much heat as I thought it would. It takes over an hour to heat up the room by 2 degrees.
5,Absolutely a Brute...Great Heater,"Everything is working better than expected...Thermostat is a must and works without a flaw, I use this heater in my 30' camper and with outside temperatures @ 35*, the camper reached 62* within a half hour and have had to even adjust the temperature downward because it quickly warmed up the structure.I couldn't be more pleased, it's a heavy unit ""well made"" and compact. I also don't have to worry about over heating nearby curtains blinds and the such because of the protective grid and directional venting, I wouldn't pass this up folks, for the money, your getting a well priced unit that could easily be worth a lot more...Keep in mind to, to use a small fan or a ceiling fan to disperse the heat from this unit, it has a strong blower, but like any compacted heating device, you need that extra draft to spread the heat away from it's fixed location.."
5,Love The Heater,These heaters are awesome. I have two and this is the third winter that we have used. It cuts down on our heating bill and I can't tell any significant difference in our electric bills. I would highly recommend them. I would definitely purchase another if needed.
4,PHONES,"I LIKE THESE PHONES ALOT, EXCEPT THAT THE BUTTONS ARE A LITTLE SMALL. OTHER THAN THAT, I LIKE THEM ALOT."
3,Not what picture shows,"In the picture listed, it shows the mounting to be the three hole plate. I should have read the description better, where it said they were made of PLASTIC. The mounting for this piece is just the top two holes, where I assume you slide it behind the plate on your windshield. It looks nice, but being that its plastic I dont have high hopes on it lasting very long. Its a shame, because its a great idea!"
2,blocks wing window,"This is a great idea but with it installed, you can no longer open the wing window. Its kind of a bummer because i use the window quite a bit. i am going to mount it using some self tapping screws away from the window so i can use them both at the same time."
2,Could have been better,These exact holders used to be made from metal. I wish I'd seen they cheapened the product and now make them from plastic. I assume that one will break within the year. I have low expectations which is too bad because a couple friends have the exact one except made from metal and they are pretty much indestructible these plastic ones are not.
1,Ugly Bubbling,"Unless you're going for that bubbling look, this is not the nailpolish to purchase. I made the mistake of going in and getting this as a blind purchase (no research beforehand). My thought was, ""Hey, it's a two-in-one and only 7 bucks. Why not?!"" Well... This is why not: first, as I have already said, it leaves this horrible bubbling (from my personal experience at least). Also, the top coat takes a longer amount of time to dry than some of the 2 dollar top coats I've purchased in the past. I've tried using this on two different nail jobs and it's the same result. To name some pros, however, it does have some good staying power and the packaging is kind of cute. Ha. Overall, I'm just a bit disappointed and I'll invest in a quality separate base coat and my 2 dollar top coats."
4,Surprising and Great,"I first heard of Jai on a Banana Republic Charity mix CD. ""I Believe"" was their track on this CD and it REALLY grew on me. So I got the full CD, and it was very good. There are 5 really good titles in there and the rest are OK (my opinion). Any way, I would certainly recommend this album."
4,excellent voice!,"When I heard ""Heaven"" on the radio, I was determined to rush out and buy the cd no matter how much it was. (It's a shame that you can't hear a sample cut of that song, it rocks!) I was a little disappointed at first with the lack of variety in the songs, but if you give the album time, it definitely grows on you!This guy has an awesome voice, and although it seems like nobody has ever heard of him, everyone seems to like his music. Give it a chance, I think you'll be pleasantly surprised."
4,"Not for all ears, but a delight for those who like this sort of thing.","Personally, I found this to be a well-recorded and enjoyable foray into an oddball genre. Be sure to sample it somewhere before buying, but if you like the sampling, the full album should be pleasing to you."
3,Just Ok,"This book was just a simple fast read. It's easy to understand and basically you can skip half of the book because it's just senseless conversations. I read this on a rainy Sunday afternoon and it was entertaining. However, if you're looking for something that makes sense and has a meaning, don't get this book. If you're just looking for mindless entertainment, this is definitely the book for you. The plot was just stupid, but entertaining."
3,It was OK!,"I really like Gloria Mallette. This book was pretty good and I held off from getting it after reading the jacket. But it kept calling me back. Basically, because of Shades of Jade. That was the best!. This is not the same at all to me. I missed the suspense. But all in all this was entertaining.The mother was terrible. I don't think she loved her daughter or new how to love. I think in her mind she needed her daughter more than anything. The best part of the story to me was funeral. I wanted Big Walt and the daughter to hook up. But they didn't. The ending was not what I wanted it to be.I also want to say that I appreciated the format of the book. Yes, the format. The font was easy on the eyes but not elementary. The chapter headings were even special. I don't remember seeing errors in the book either, which is a serious pet-peeve of mine."
5,Mother or Foe???,"This book is filled with drama, drama, and more drama. I really recommend this book. I never got bored! Rarely ever do I give a book 5 stars but this one definitely earned it. I'm really starting to like this author..."
5,Buy it!,"You. Must. Buy. This. CD. It's just like being at a live Dave concert, except in the privacy of your own living room. Not to mention it is one of his best concert sets ever. You'll hear songs that you won't find on any album (Seek up, #36)....And believe me, you won't be disappointed."
2,too many problems to overlook,"Sometimes with new technology, you overlook some little problems. This unit has too many to deal with. No chase record, the YES function is something you pay for. Can't use many characters to title something. Very slow to start up and load. Not consistant in playing disks. On occasion the unit will completely freeze up and stop working. You have to unplug it to get it going again. And....where the heck is the ""MENU"" button?? I just hated the Sony unit I have, and I loved a Pioneer unit I also have. But, I wanted the hard drive and the Philips was in stock. Oh Lord, what was I thinking? Stay away from this unit. Clunky and disappointing."
3,good for price...but,"The price is good, but there are a few issues. Very slow start up. sometimes it just freezes and you have to unplug it...usually happens when you are using the remote. The remote SUCKS. It is poorly designed, the buttons are way too small which makes it difficult (and I have v.small hands) and it seems stupid but the top and bottom of the remote is identical and ALWAYS you have the damn thing backwards. AND there's no menu button, so I still haven't figured out how to get back to the menu of a DVD - so you use the skip buttons, and this is when it freezes. Oh and it's not multi-region from start..it's set to your region and you have to contact Philips to get a special code so you can watch your overseas discs. All in all, it does the job but I kind of wished I'd paid more to get one where these issues above aren't a problem...because they happen everytime you use it, the small stuff gets well sweated!"
1,"Terrible hardware, worse customer service","I have owned this product (regrettably) for almost a year. I've finally given up getting Philips to assist with a Warranty repair...To begin with, no foresight was given to the overall user experience. For example, when you initially turn on the device, wait about 10 seconds for it to fire up, then push the DVD button on the remote, the unit simply ignores your request and goes straight to the tuner. Menus are slow, response time is worse. Not only that, but the build quality is sub-par. The DVD tray on my unit constantly locks up and won't open. That's what I contacted Philips about. After waiting on hold for 15 minutes, I was told to fax them my receipt and someone would contact me. Still waiting to hear from them...Don't buy this product. Philips just doesn't care about its customer base and simply shoots for market share at any price."
2,not happy,This movie is one I've been looking for and thought I had finally found it on Amazon. Guess Ineed to pay more attention to the description. This dvd was not recognized by my DVD player asit's for Great Britain only. The first time I've ever been disappointed.
2,Ford's Dullest Western,"John Ford called ""Two Rode Together"" (1961) ""the worst piece of crap I've done in 20 years."" He was right. The legendary filmmaker shows little enthusiasm for this dreary rehash of ""The Searchers."" James Stewart and Richard Widmark are good additions to the Ford stock company, but they cannot bolster Frank S. Nugent's flat script and the director's overall fatigue. Happily, Ford rebounded with his final masterpiece, ""The Man Who Shot Liberty Valance"" (1962)."
5,Excellent documentary,"Regardless of your age or gender, if you're interested even a little bit in either rodeo or history, you NEED this DVD. There's nothing else like it. The extensive research required for this project is both obvious and impressive.And if you're not a rodeo fan or a history buff, buy this documentary as a gift for someone who is."
3,Somebody Wake Me When It's Over,"Remember Two Things is oh so sensitive, oh so soft, oh so meandering, oh so indulgent and oh so l-o-o-o-o-n-g. From the interminable repeated one note drum opening on Ants Marching to DMB's take on Jesus, Christmas Song, you listen to this and see how his underground reputation built steadily. But even back then you also see his long-range limitations, kind of this decade's Bruce Hornsby and the Range. For me, I'm mighty glad he got some good advice along the way on livening up his arrangements, making some of the best cuts on his first couple of albums well worth keeping as mp3s. As for Remember Two Things, once you get through the single drumstick opening, Ants Marching and Satellite carry the CD but the rest is for historical and rabid DMB fan interest only."
2,yes 2 stars,READ THIS trust me this is not a great album except for minarets and recently. matthews sounds weird and they slowed down the wrong songs most are horrible versions of great songsonly buy this if your a desperate fan otherwise go buy red rocks
3,"Solid, but unspectacular","This debut cd by DMB is pretty good, but lacks oomph at times. You really can't tell that most of the songs are live, but songs like Ants Marching & Satellite are much better on UTTAD. One Sweet World is top-notch, as are Minarets and Seek Up. However, the beginning of Ants Marching is very annoying, with that constant snare drum with no other music. I am sure most hardcore DMB fans already have this, but if you are looking to start somewhere with this band, I recommend the 3 studio albums. Unlike many, I prefer DMB in the studio than DMB live."
5,"I can't pick a favorite, but this one's up there","I love the Dave Matthews Band. While all of my other fads in music come and go Dave is always in the front of my cd case, and this particular album has basically staked it's claim to a perminent spot in my cd player. The first few tracks are some of their better known, and are always fun to listen to in their earlier, less rehearsed form, and once you hit track #5-(which I believe is one sweet world)you'll wish it didn't have to end. I hope you'll enjoy it as much as I do, and be warned- once you buy one you'll want them all."
1,Almost Entirely Useless,"I read through this book, performed all the exercises, completed all the exams and flashcards. When the time came to take the certification exam I was pretty much in shock. Half the questions on the exam were not covered in this book. The IZO-411 exam went into detail on PL/SQL where the book only covered the basics. The exam had many questions regards DDL, DML, PMON, SMON, all of which aren't even mentioned in the book. This book is only good for a paper weight or a coaster."
3,"Not the best, but affordable","If you're looking for a good DVD player with easy DVD recording at a good price, the Philips DVDR3400 is for you. If you're looking to easily edit your recordings then it's probably not the one you want. It was more difficult to change thumbnail index pictures and titles than my previous recorders. The slow-response remote can get aggravating also. But if you're just looking to record and save without editing, then this recorder should suit you perfectly."
1,DO NOT BUY,Don't waste your money like so many of us have. This DVD recorder is nothing but a waste of time and money. Charges should be brought up on phillips for selling such a worthless product. Criminals!!!!!
1,INAPPROPRIATE for children...DO NOT buy this book!,"Beware! This is a disgusting, dark, and gory book filled with mystical creatures and very NUDE fairies hidden within its pages. Children should not be exposed to this garbage. If I could have given the book NO stars, I would have."
3,Good Read. Takes some license,"I enjoyed John MacArthur's Twelve Ordinary Men despite some reaching on his part. The Chapters on Peter, John, and Judas Iscariot were mostly excellent. This is primarily because there is no shortage of information on these men in the Biblical Record. The problem I found was that even with those three and especially with the lesser know Disciples, MacArthur assumes some things that may be true (we cannot know for sure), and then refers back to the assumptions as fact. Despite that issue, there is a ton of good information in this book and it is one that I recommend. Just remember that a lot of the details we won't really know until we meet these men on the other side."
5,Great kids book,Great book for a Preschoolers. I lead a class as a teacher and the kids have lots of fun and movement with this book
5,Very Helpful Book,"Pastor John MacArthur walks the reader through the lives of the original 12 Disciples, including the betrayer Judas Iscariot. This book is rich in background information about each of these 12 men, and my favorite parts were when the author used early church historical accounts to talk about how the disciples all died (Judas Iscariot's death is recorded in the Bible but the other 11 are not).This book is packed with information and is a great resource for preaching, teaching, or just personal study."
3,"Starts great, ends great, shame about the padding","I agree with J.A. Pritchet. This book could have been, and maybe should have been, 150 pages instead of 244. The sections on the better-known Apostles are excellent, but then the rest of the book is padded out with pure conjecture often presented as undeniable fact. For example, MacArthur states that 'without doubt' Nathanael liked to sit under fig trees while studying the scriptures, then fills a page or two padding out that statement. That's stretching the text just a little! Is this the mistake of an author who has become a little too certain of his own opinions? I don't know, that's just conjecture ;). Still, it's enjoyable if you read with enough discernment to pick out the more inspiring and encouraging parts."
1,For Bible Studies,This is an excellent book for single reading or for a group or Sunday School class study. It has proved enlightening.
3,Good reference,"Makes a good reference and has many tips for beginners like me. I have both this book and the Carol Doak book "" Your First Quilt Book"". They both have good tips and answer questions about how to start. But practice make perfect and there is no substitute for trial and error. But the book I like the best is ""Patchwork Quilts Made Easy revised 2nd edition"" by Jean Wells."
3,NOT the book to buy to learn quilting!,"When I first began to consider the possibility of making a quilt, I thought ""The Complete Idiot's Guide to Quilting"" would be the way to go. The Idiots Guides are very detailed. In fact, the author could not have been more inclusive.The problem--and to me a major problem--is the lack of color photographs to accompany and illustrate all the steps in making a quilt. All my other quilting books and magazines are lush with color, as it should be with quilts. Quilt makers need to see how color and patterns can be used together. Although the book was published in 2004, digital cameras were not in their initial phase. The photographs in this book are crooked, lacklustre, and downright unhelpful.That's it--that's all I have to say. Use this book if you want the detail of quilting. But if you want to be shown how to put color and pattern together, go to the next book. This one will disappoint."
1,mr christmas stepping,i bought the stepping santa a few years ago i used him one year packed him away and got him out next year he would not work again no power to him ive bought new power cord but he still dosent work i set him out any way to look at maxine mcpeak osborne
5,This Book Will Put You In the Money!,This is a great book with over 150 video machines analyzed and explained. You can use the strategies easily as they are in plain English and don't require a math degree. I found that I was winning more and getting comped more because of knowing which machines to play and how to play them. A great book!
4,Charles Atlas Returns!,"This is a GREAT product for all Charles Atlas fans!Heres' what you get:- a poster of a Charles Atlas ad, on the other side are illustrations and descriptions of some of the major exercises from the course-a small book also describing the exercises, dietary advice, and clean living.- a boxing lesson. Far better than the one from the original course.-Charles Atlas trading cards with Atlas photos on the face Atlas quotes on the back.-a booklet of the course brochure. This alone is worth more than this entire package, check ebay prices for this if you don't believe me!- a refrigerator magnet-tape measure as well.-It even comes with a $10.00 off coupon for the full course! WOWThe downside- one exercise is wrong! The cross arm/chest excercise.This is sure to be a collectors item- get several!"
4,Solid introduction to funny cars,"My wife and I saw this on television when it first came out and were delighted with it. More a documentary than a drama, it is an excellent introduction to racing in general and funny cars in particular. Well worth it."
4,Good Ole Times...,"I, like the rest here, have seen this movie back in the early '70s. Ever since, I have loved all types of cars. Funny Cars are the best. Some other places to visit funny cars online [...]. If you enjoy old times, get this movie."
3,Interesting..........,I saw this movie in 1974 or '75 at a theater on a Friday night. I was about 5 or 6 years old and never forgot it. Glad I found it.
5,Darkly funny gem - an overlooked masterpiece,"Patrick McGinley is able to do what few novelists can: write stories and characters that are drenched in place (specifically, rural Ireland), and yet totally devoid of cheap sentimentality. His landscapes have the edgy, ludicrous beauty of a dream - unstable and prone to capsize into nightmare.Goosefoot is such a story - the tale of a tough, smart farm girl who moves to the city, and the temptations that befall and ultimately destroy her. This is the story in a nutshell, and yet the details are what make it wonderful: the bitterly funny characters and the luminous, witty dialogue that carries them from one misadventure to another. One of the handful of novels that gets better with each reading."
2,Silver charm,This silver charm of the Brooklyn Bridge is a disappointment. It is very lightweight silver and does not have the substance of a good silver charm. The definition of the bridge is not as good as it should be. Order was sent out very quickly.
1,"Legal Aspects of Architectue, Engineering, and the Construction Process",I recieved my book and there are pages missing. Page 518-551 are gone. I have called your company three time to have this issue resolved but everytime I am told the computers are down and that they cannot look at my account. This has been the worst buying experience. I am trying to take a class and missing these pages is really messing me up. I expect somone to fix this error. I find it hard to believe that the computers at a dot com company are down everytime I call!!!!!!
5,"Failure, a Learning Experience","A wonderful book! Time to realize the positive side of failure--its among the best ways to learn. Rather than bottling up the bile of failure, distill it and learn from it. And, with that you can accelerate personal and professional growth.Leif SkoogforsLansdale, PA"
2,DON'T READ IT FOR THE MAIN CHARECTERS,"THE REAL STAR OF THIS BOOK IS LADY ELENORE, ALICIA'S MOTHER. IF THERE IS ANY REASON TO READ IT AT ALL, IT WOULD BE HER. THE LAUGHS WERE GREAT."
3,Hard to get attached to the characters,"I found this book difficult to get attached to. The characters didn't have enough depth to hold me and though I did finish the book, I wondered why I did."
5,A loving look at caring for some one and learning about your self too.,Eating Heavenis a story of a woman who suddenly finds herself taking on the role of care giver while she is busy living her own life. It is a touching story of relationships to self and family and bringing new people into the circle.
5,"The Alarm ""Under Attack""","The Alarm are definetely back. Straight from their #1 hit on the UK Rock chart with the hard-hitting ""Superchannel"", from the album ""Under Attack"", the band is tighter and more cohesive than ever.Lyrically the songs are in-your-face, poignant, anthemic and ring of the optimism that is the hallmark of Mike Peters incredible song-writing talent.In a music world full of one-hit wonders, it is refreshing to see the Alarm as fresh and innovative as ever in a long 25 year career run.Highly suggest the version of the album with the bonus dvd featuring the 12 videos to accompany the album. These 12 ""mini-films"" brilliantly capture the energy and innovation of the band.Required listening and viewing for any Alarm fan and beyond."
3,2nd. Grizzly Spit,We bought a Grizzly Spit and enjoyed it so much at home we decided to buy a 2nd. Grizzly Spit for camp. We ordered our 2nd. one expecting it to be the same and it wasn't as good. It didn't have the DC capabilities as the 1st. one and the bag that carries everything is made of cheaper fabric. So we were a little disapointed.
4,Reads a bit like seven biographies,"I read this book to learn about altruism, but I think I actually learned more about the seven scientists who studied this concept. I learned some interesting facts about evolutionary theory's treatment of altruism for a paper I am writing for school, but I think I enjoyed reading about the personal lives of the scientists even more. I would recommend this easy to read, relatively short, book to anyone interested in the history of scientific ideas."
5,Sorry it has to end,I have really enjoyed the Hideaway Series. I did not want this novel to end. A great book from a great author.
5,Great progressive Bluegrass,"I can't say enough about the harmony and musicianship of this group. I'm especially a fan of Don Wayne, the banjo player. His playing is a joy to hear. This album is great, and a pleasure to listen to!"
3,"Child of Darkness, Child of Light","A priest is sent from Vatican city to investigate two virgin births that were promised in a letter that hadn't been opened until the last decade of the 20th century. The promise is that one of the virgin teenagers will give birth to a child who will give goodness to the world, and the other virgin will give birth to the anti-Christ. Although filmed very well, nicely laid out and containing a few dedicated performances, this isn't nearly as good as those similar, theatrical films from earlier in time like ""Rosemary's Baby"" and ""The Omen."" Fine score by Jay Gruska enhances the experience here. It is a TV movie, however, and for that, I must give it credit for being quite effective and entertaining. Sela Ward steals the show in this so-so Catholic chiller."
5,Nice product. Easy to use,"Really nice product. The only annoying thing is the red light. Though is to let you know the card is working, it shouldnt be too flashy. Besides that, the software and the controls are easy to use. Recommended for any notebook user that wish to have good quality 5.1 sound with their system without expending money on a expensive pcmcia(pc card) or express card sound card(that actually requires another adapter for the card to be able to use 5.1 speakers, so yeah, too expensive). This will work on any desktop computer as well, but you can get a better internal sound card at the same price or less. Anyways, newer desktop computers already come with integrated 5.1 sound card, so is not really necessary to add one."
1,Poor Support,I bought this to work with a Windows 98SE machine because the sound card is advertised as working with Windows 98 up through VISTA. The sound card will not install; no drives for Windows 98 on the installation disk. Contacted Zalman for support; they never replied!
1,DO NOT BUY IF YOU OWN A MAC!!! FOR ANY REASON!!!,"The Zalman ZM-RSSC V2 does not work for any reason on a mac. Not even a little. It works as a 2.0 but you get that just by plugging it into the back of your mac. saving you $50. Spend the money on a new set of speakers instead.I read some other idiots review on this item and made my purchase. They have no clue! I have talked to a Mac Genius, My friend who is a Mac retailer and certified repair tech. No one can make it work. If you own a Mac it will only work as 2.0 which it does all by itself without this purchase. It may work fine if you want to go buy a PC and then add this. Zalman makes other good items. Just don't use this for a Mac"
1,Don't bother,"This gets one star for 1) misleading specifications and 2) not doing what it is meant to do.The misleading information is the optical/coaxial interface. It is neither, it's a 3.5 mm jack. The resolution on the photo is such that it's impossible to determine this by looking at it. The manual is equally vague. Quite how a piece of solid metal is meant to interface with a beam of light is beyond me. As for not doing what it was meant to, well, I was never able to coax 5.1 out of it. It's a lightweight and entirely unconvincing piece of hardware, and a big waste of your time."
4,Comprehensive.,"This is a very good algebra book. The examples are well laid out. Each step taken to arrive at the answer is clear and explained. With its easy to follow format along with its real world application examples makes this book, in my opinion, a great buy for any student."
4,intermediate algebra book,the product was used and good shape. i recieved the book in a short amt of time. no complaints
3,nostalgia and superheroes,"The avengers hold a certain nostalgic enjoyment for me. The issues gathered in this volume present a terrific collection of stories circa the 1960's. The plots are simplistic and the costumes gaudy, but that is just part of the charm- and who can forget such great characters, like Goliath (formerly Giant-man), Hercules, and Captain America? However, the printing leaves a lot to be desired: It is as times blurry and uneven, and it is all in black and white, in the style you would find in a weekday newspaper comic strip. Nevertheless, you get a compilation of several issues for a low price, which makes it worth buying."
2,Black & white reprints of classic four-color comics...?,"I honestly don't get the appeal of these books. Why bother making (or reading) black & white reprints of classic four-color comics...? I mean, yeah, the stories are still great and the original comics are hard to find, but a huge part of what made these comics great was the eye-popping artwork, including the bright primary colors: reading them in dull B&W; is just plain wrong. Sure, the printing costs are lower, so you can get more pages for your money, but it's more pages of boring, not more pages of fun. It's really a travesty.On the other hand, it recently occurred to me that these could be used as coloring books... Maybe you could buy a box of crayons to go along with all the artwork that the publishers ruined in this format.PS - Unlike several of the other reviewers, I actually always liked this run of the ""Avengers""... especially Hawkeye being such a big butthead. (Axton)"
1,Totally Ignores The Facts of Reality,"Statisticans can make numbers come out however they like. However this ignores the reality of investors like Warren Buffet, K. Kikorian, Ty Cobb just to name 3 who made millions in the market starting from practically nothing.Along with that people who bought Microsoft, Dell, Cisco, Google when they first went public to name just four of hundreds of stocks that adroit investors have millions on by buying and holding.Malkiel has the mind of an acamadician and not and investor. Random work theorists are defeatists and left wing anti-captilists who attack capitalism in an attempt to validate their belief in Karl Marx's theories."
1,An Egghead's Theory on how Wall Street Works,"It's interesting how with each new edition, the efficiant market theory slowly morphs into value and growth investing. When the book first came out, Malkiel wrote that a monkey throwing darts can beat professional stock pickers. Well, for a couple of years the Wall Street Journal ran a series pitting stock pros against a monkey. From what I remember the monkey lost. I also remember that Malkiel ran a mutual fund which wasn't all too hot (he probably used the Wall Street Journal's monkey!). Now Malkiel recommends loading up on index funds, which by the way are loaded with blue chip stocks and are not at all chosen randomly. Save your money and buy Graham's Intelligent Investor, The Essays of Warren Buffett, and Fisher's Common Stocks and Uncommon Profits"
3,"Dated material, doesn't reflect stock market in the past decade","While the overall premise of the book is pretty good and gives some good insight into the stock market, the material feels severely dated and doesn't necessarily hold true for the past decade in the stock market. A long-term buy and hold strategy probably worked till the late nineties and perhaps the early 2000's, but it wouldn't have done well between say 2006 and 2012 when the market has been so volatile. Holding on to a stock between 2006 and 2012 would have likely depleted your stock portfolio. In turbulent times with high volatility or over years with relatively flat-ish growth, this strategy will burn you. You are better off re-balancing your portfolio actively during this time. Cash out your gains and wait for the opportune dip before investing that money in another stock."
2,WEAK--Danny Joe's return does NOT revive the old magic...,"I LOVE Molly Hatchet's first two albums with Danny Joe fronting--great southern rock. When he left the band after their second album, that was the end of the band, as far as I'm concerned. And his coming back in 1985 to produce this CD does not save the day, I'm sorry. These songs are just WEAK. The only good one is the epic ""Fall of The Peacemakers."" All the others range from mediocre to just plain bad. Not nearly as good as their two albums from the late 70's. I only recommend those and the Live Double Trouble CD."
2,Not for Everyone,"This product was recommended to me by a friend who stated his older dog was able to move around much easier after taking this supplement. However, my dog became sick after taking this. He vomited a few times after eating this on top of his food. Maybe he just has a sensitive stomach because my friend loves this product."
5,Revenge DVD,Great DVD story about the lives of a few familes who live on the South Fork of Long Island. The video shots wure take me back their - sure enjoyed living in the area and the story line of the DVD Revenge is just Great.
5,Revenge,"What can I say, Great story line, Kept you guessing, Loved all the twists and turns, I do reccommend this season a must watch, I can't wait for season two."
5,Great series,This is a great series and I received it in plenty of time to watch before the current season - I recommend.
4,Woodcarving with Rick Butz,"I enjoyed the book a great deal and gave a copy to my uncle this christmas. He also gives it a thumbs up. Rick does a great job at giving detailed instructions and the photos are excellent as well. The material covered ranges from beginning whittler to well seasoned carver levels. Whether you choose to carve with just a knife or you carve with a thousand chisels and goudges, you can find a great little project in Rick's book. I really enjoyed carving the wood spirit and merganser. Great idea book."
3,informative and tedious all at once,"It's sad to have one of one's heroes shot down. Apparently Koestler's understanding of why old Bolsheviks caught in the Stalinist terror confessed to crimes they had not committed was based less on facts than on his own psychological dilemmas. It is also tiresome to have yet another biography of a central European Jew caught between assimilation and anti-semitism and between Communism and anti-Communism. As for K's alleged sexual proclivities, I could not care less. Another hero gone. They have taken George Orwell out by showing his nasty side, and now they have taken out Koestler."
5,The ultimate guide for Disney vacationers,"Disney On A Dime: Money-Saving Secrets For Your Walt Disney World Vacation by Chris and Kristal Carlson is the ultimate guide for Disney vacationers, guaranteeing to save the reader $200 on their next Walt Disney World Vacation. Written with a very ""user-friendly"" setup, Disney On A Dime will guide its readers through an affordable and fun vacation. Enhanced with strategies on money saving, 101 free things to do in and around the parks, the""secret"" option which Disney won't tell you about, and many more helpful and informative guidelines, strongly recommended to all Walt Disney World vacationers."
4,It worked for me,"I used this book and from what I've read it mentions stuff that I might not have or didn't think of. Disney is and will always be expensive. The title itself is not to be taken literally. We took our lunches in and not a word was said..I did this without a second thought. Believe me,they got plenty of money out of me when it was all said and done. So I feel no guilt about saving a few bucks for lunch. If you can save some money while at ""The World"" do it. This is a guide and an informative one at that. 263 days and counting!!"
2,Not modern enough,"I made certain assumptions about this product.I should have reviewed a sample before buying it.I was disappointed that:1) It does not have a Table of Contents2) It does not have a ToC that has active hyper-links3) It is written in archaic English, not modern English.This is not a Kindle-ready product.For $1.89 I'll use it until I find a better vesion."
3,Beautiful But Not Water Resistant,"I really liked this watch. The face and band are beautiful and classy. However, the watch is not remotely water resistant. It was supposed to water resistant to 30 meters. I did not wear it in the shower or otherwise submerse it in water. I did dishes with it, but did not get it soaked. After only a week, the watch had water droplets on the inside of the glass. It was not just hazy mist but actual water droplets that covered most of the watch face. I couldn't make out the time. The droplets dried out after 3 days. I returned the item. Thanks, Amazon, for a no-hassle return policy.If you want a nice watch that isn't going to go near water, this would be a nice choice."
2,Its more like a FLITTED sheet,"Sheets must have sat on the shelf too long because when I took them out to put on the bed all the elastic binders in the corners snapped. I suppose they dried out with age. What can you expect with discontinued product? Should have been deeply discounted, rather than close to full price."
1,Doesn't work,"The letters are so low profile that it is impossible to make an image, even on cardboard or tinfoil. The seller was very nice about letting me return the product, and I did so, but it cost me more in shipping costs than the price of the metal stamps. I suggested to the seller that they drop this item as it will not make anyone happy and will make them look bad."
3,Bandersnatch not up to snuff,"Compared to the other 87th precinct books, this one was not satisfying. There were several loose ends, though not the titillating kind that make me desperate for the next volume, just unaccounted for characters and plotlines. For us die hard fans, its still worth a read. Its not terrible like the last two Patricia Cornwell books.A side note: Maybe I just didn't notice before but McBain makes up his own words in Bandersnatch. Is there a whole list of McBain-isms?"
4,"3 1/2 Stars -- A Good, Fast Read!","The Frumious Bandersnatch is about an up-and-coming music star who is kidnapped from a rented yacht while performing at a party promoting her first album. In typical McBain fashion, his latest 87th Precinct police procedural combines an enjoyable, fast-paced plot with true-to-life characters and dialogue. Having said this, on a comparative basis, The Frumious Bandersnatch has a somewhat more predictable ending and has less action and surprises than several of McBain's previous books. Further, I found a few of the romatic sub-storylines (i.e., those involving Detctives Hawes and Ollie Weeks Hawes) to be more filler than having anything to do with the real plot of the book. If you're a fan of the 87th Precinct series I think you might feel (as I do) that The Frumious Bandersnatch is a good, fast enjoyable book but one that is a slight notch below some of the others in this series."
2,could've been better,"This game's interface was really annoying.I hated having to keep both party members alive at all times.The voice acting could've been better.Reminded me too much of Diablo.The graphics were mediocre at best.You can't adjust the difficulty once you've started the game, and this game is HARD!If Taco Bell is still open go there instead of playing this game.This could've been a good game if they would've designed it better.I gave it two stars because I have played worse.My grandpa died while I was playing this game.He liked football."
4,Feet wetting,"If you know nothing of the Crusades, this excellent little book will bring you up to speed. However, keep in mind that the Crusades span several hundred years, consisting of distinct (often disjoint) episodes of history, while this book spans fewer than 200 pages. As a result, most of the context and many of the details, which can be fascinating, are omitted. Enough remains to keep it interesting and sometimes entertaining.If you are familiar with the Crusades, Madden provides an objective viewpoint and some (necessarily speculative) discussion of the economic and political forces that shaped them."
3,Pre-Algebra book from Was and Is Books,"When we received the Algebra book, we were not pleased with the condition of the book. We contacted the seller, and we immediately received a full refund. We did not have to return the originally purchased copy. We were thankful for the prompt and courteous service we received."
1,Too expensive to matter if it works or not.,"Price: $29.98Sale: $13.20You Save: $16.78 (56%)What? For one tiny single itty bitty TEN OUNCE can. I got burned once this way, never again."
2,Not good on loose stools or chairs,"When my dog usually lays a loaf, it's of the super soft squidgy kind. Kinda like a Hostess Snowball. After using this product, his doggy little debbies are a bit more solid, but still way too squishy for me to want to pick up with my bare hands!So do what I do! Sprinkle some cat litter on the poop and convince your dog that it's cat poop. He'll scarf his own doggie tootsie rolls like they were leftovers from dinner.How's that for recycling Mr Gore?!? BOOYAH!!"
3,crime scene photos,a clear a concise book of early 1900's crime scene photos with interesting text. not for the faint hearted. very graphic stuff including an image of a dead pregnant dog.
3,"Nice Book, But Pretty Worn","The book was interesting but I would not have rated this item in ""good"" condition. It was pretty beat with some marks and smelled musty to me."
2,Falling apart from the get-go,"The stitching on this bag is terrible. When the bag came, there was loose thread everywhere and the seams looked like they had already been stretched beyond their use. Despite this, I used this bag as my school bag carrying books and what not for what seemed like a couple of weeks when the top seam right above the left shoulder came undone. I stitched it back up, but now I am wary of putting any real weight in it and it feels like a ticking timebomb. If this bag were used in any real strenuous way, I'm sure it would fall apart in a couple weeks, requiring constant sewing. This a piece of crap like theNCStar Tactical Backpack, Black - Backpacks - DaypacksI had before; I'm trying theMilitary MOLLE Large Transport Backpackand if it falls apart I'm never believing the reviews on these cheap, crappy backpacks. If you don't want to gamble, buy name brand."
4,Gets The Job Done,"I decided to take a chance on this one. It's reasonably priced, simple, and good quality. The waist strap is pointless unless you're big and fat. I was never going to use it anyways so I just cut it off. Camelbak makes a water bottle holder attachment that goes well with it. Other than that I recommend it.AngeloU.S. ArmySouth Korea"
4,great,This is a great product and i recieved fast delivery from this seller. i would recommend this to anyone looking for a durable backpack that has multiple uses...
3,Ehh,"The bag is nice but I'm already having trouble with one of the zippers. Also it's not as big as it seemed, and the color I ordered doesn't really resemble the color of the online picture"
4,KD Tools 3191 CV Joint Boot Clamp Tightening Wrench,Great tool that works. Use a torque wrench on the tightening spool and get precise clamping. Buy your bulk clamping materials at McMaster-Carr. They sell the strapping in 100ft rolls and the strap clips in qtys of 100.
4,"Great, but long","Much of the book was fresh and exciting, but so much of it was repetitious. They could have added another 100 pages to book 11 and be done.I really liked it though."
2,Not a great ending to the series,"As a true fan of the Left Behind series, I have anxiously awaited ""Glorious Appearing,"" making sure I was able to get one the minute it came out. Needless to say, the anticipation was greater than the realization. What should have been heralded with triumph and victory was instead a great letdown. I truly was disappointed in this book. Given that ""Glorious Appearing"" is the last one in the series, it's a sad end cap to what I felt was truly an inspiring and entertaining piece of work."
1,Not what I expected,"I realize it is difficult to write about the coming of Jesus, especially in a fiction series where one book is building on the book before. The excitement that was present in books 1-11 was not there in book 12, even though it should have been the climax of the book series."
2,"Good book, but don't listen to the audio version.","I have listened to (and enjoyed) many books on CD in the past few years. This reader is among the worst that I've had the displeasure of hearing. The content of this book is great, so don't get me wrong. However, the reader makes it impossible to experience the book the way it was intended. He pronounces many character names incorrectly, including Carpathia and Adbullah. His character voices range from unconvincing to downright abrasive and/or annoying (especially Carpathia's). His voice inflection is often very wrong when reading dialogue. He also adds pauses in the middle of sentences without any obvious reason. These are just the most obvious and annoying problems. There are too many to list completely here, so please trust me and avoid listening to this book!"
3,Now that you have read the end...,"Now that you have read the end, let's here the rest of the story.We have to remember that this is two men's projection of events to come. They have not happened yet. But! If you have not readthe Bible for yourself, then go do it. I would start with the book of Luke, then Acts. Followed by Matthew, Mark & John. Then Romans, 1& 2 Corinthians Ephesians, Then Genesis, Exodus, Isaiah, Daniel. Then Revelation. Then read the other books you missed.Then you will know; the rest of the story. God's plan for man.And his son Jesus Christ. Or if you don't want to do that; pick up your Bible and start reading from the first page you turn to."
3,"Even collectively, not as good as Christ Clone trilogy","Now that all 12 of the Left Behind books are out, I can say that even the 12 books together are not as good as even a single book of the Christ Clone trilogy. It's probably too late to tell you not to waste your time with this series, but once you've finished this, try Christ Clone and see if you don't agree."
5,Wonderful,"This book is worth every cent. It should be in every believers household so that when the Rapture comes, those left behind will have something to encourage them. This book would do it!"
5,Application makes all the difference!,"Sadly many think that we have to have a dialogue with the devil. Just as Jesus used the Word of God while He was in the wilderness, I am so thankful that the authors stayed true to Biblical spiritual warfare. In Christ Jesus we have been His authority and power!!! Having SEEN the Sword make a demon possessed person literally bow down on her knees with her face to the floor in submission made me realize more deeply that Elohim is who He says He is and that everything He says is true!This book is a GREAT TOOL that can be used to help teach us to do what Jesus did... apply the Word of GOD in daily living. We are more than conquerors!"
5,Glorious appearing: the end of days,"Great book! I could not put it down. It made me cry both tears of joy and sadness. I felt at times like Jesus was speaking to me personally. So happy I will be raptured and will miss the tribulation, thank God."
5,Glorious Appearing: The End of Days (Left Behind #12),Received and sure I will enjoy the book as I have enjoyed all the books in the series so far.
3,Guide to Literary Agents 2007,The book was informative and was what I needed. I will purchase the 2008 edition unless I get an agent before then for my novel.
5,Very Roomy Bag,"The bag is a must have for all cameras. It's very spacious with plenty of room for your camera, extra batteries, chargers, extra lenses, and lots, lots more. You will fall in love with it. It's always a good idea to have an extra battery on hand. The filter works beautifully! You will love this kit."
2,Get another bag,Pleased with all things included other than the bag. Had it less than 3 months and the stitching in the comfort pad on the strap just disintegrated. Came loose in several places. It's not very durable and I'd suggest buying another bag from another manufacturer.
5,Unbelievable bargain!,"Canon - Digital camera starter kitWhat more can I say than ""WOW""? For just a little more than the price of the spare battery alone you get a fantastic Canon carry bag and the Haze filter.The only catch is, if you want a small camera bag, this is not the one for you. If, however, you are looking for a camera bag that will carry your camera body, an assortment of lenses, filters, flash, spare batteries and charger and many memory cards, THIS IS THE ONE! I love having an actual Canon bag for my Canon camera and accessories.I am very happy with this Amazon purchase and would recommend it to friends."
1,Not as Pictured,I ordered this with the spade design. But what I got was a very PLAIN looking timer instead. I guess it will still work. . but I just wish merchants would use the correct pictures for what they actually SEND. This happened to us once before on Amazon.
3,Not quite as depicted.,"I found this ring to be a little disappointing in person. The quality is good, and the weight is OK, but not as heavy as a solid S/S ring due to the spinner! I noticed right away that the area behind the Greek Key design is not black (as depicted in the picture,) but rather a light matte gray. It is funny, but I took a quick shot of it with my ""Photo Booth"" camera built into my MacBook Pro, to include as an attachment, but alas it too looks darker in this shot than it does in person. Shipping was quick, customer service is pretty responsive. Overall, a happy purchase, I'll keep it and am wearing it as I type this review."
1,WILL NOT ORDER AGAIN,I wanted texas size muffin papers this product is almost to small for regular tins
1,2.4 ghz NOT 5.8,"The technical details on this page state this is a 5.8 Ghz phone, which would make sense given its bluetooth capable and most users may have a wireless network in the house. As you are probably aware 5.8 Ghz doesn't interfere with networks they way 2.4 does as 2.4 is the same frequency that WI-FI operates on. But if you look down to the actual product description (or on Panasonic's website) it states the phone is 2.4 Ghz, which will render this phone useless if used within range of WI-FI and may render your WI-FI network inoperable. Not often you see a design flaw of this magnitude."
2,"Beautiful, but depressing","I was prepared to love March of the Penguins. I enjoy nature programs, love penguins, and adore Morgan Freeman's voice, but shut the dvd player off before it was halfway through. Unfortunately, the film's (every five minutes) obsession with the death and losses in the penguin colony sucked all the air out of what could have been an uplifting and educational experience. I dont understand how this film received a G rating...........young children will be upset if old enough to understand the narrative."
3,"cute, yes; but contoversial ???","this was a nice travelogue in the 1950s-60s disney tradition, but was nowhere near as impressive as id been led to believe. and i saw nothing cloying about the morgan freeman narration, which was serviceable in the best sense of the word. and what the hell was that stupid fuss between the lifers and the choicers claiming that this was some sort of parable about the sanctity of life? jeez, its just a nice movie about penguins!"
3,Natl Geo after school special,"Ok, I dont get it. This is a perfectly nice little National Gepgraphic TV special. Whats it doing as the most sucessful blah blah blah? Nice but forgettable."
5,Let the True Emperor Arise,"This is a fantastic look into the life of the Emperor Penguin as he navagates his way through life. It is amazing the amount that you don't know about these cuddly creatures..They go through extreme hardship in extreme conditions to bring their one offspring into the world...The cinematography is wonderful and the narration done by Morgan Freeman sets the perfect tone...You will go through all emotions on this one and the penguin endears itself even more to you as it tugs on your heart-strings. One for all the family...highly recommended, enjoy !!! (in fact, I'm off to watch it again)"
4,beautyful pictures and a loveley story,"It was wonderful to see this film again in this high quality in my own home theater. Its fascinating to see this penguins on a big screen. This film is definitely one of the HD DVDs that have to be in every good collection.The look is partially a little grainy, because the film is shot in 16mm.But i like this analog film look. Its a pity, that the original version is not alternative on the disc with subtitles. The voiceover of morgan freeman is good, no doubt. But in the original version (in the german synchronisation to) the penguins tells the story by themselfs like actors. This has definitive more flair. So good 4 stars."
5,incredible,"Morgan Freeman narrates this Film&does a Great Job. He is not only One of the Greatest Actors Ever,but also has a timeless Voice that you know anywhere. this film captures life for the Penguins&the relationships between Mother,father&child. also how they feed themsevles&surivive.great direction,and so full of life.the film isn't long but it gets to the point&the Heart of the matter.more films should take cue from this film.it captures the imagination&stays on point all the way through."
5,Great movie - kids should see it,"This is a terrific movie for adults AND kids. So what, there's dead penguins and a seal attack. But kids should be exposed to the beauty in nature that is life and death. Quit pampering them and have a heart-to-heart discussion about the real life of penguins (and all of us, for that matter). I found Morgan Freeman's narrative to be excellent, the cinematography is wonderful, and the sheer feat of filming this movie is amazing."
3,[Three-and-a-half out of four stars] Fine film and narration,"despite the stupid evolutionist slant.Well filmed and very imformative. MorganFreeman is paid to read the script andit comes off a bit wooden. Fancinatinglook at the life of one of god's greatcreatures, the most amazing bird on earth."
3,What's all the hype about?,"Uhhhh...I heard great things about this movie. Maybe all the people who loved it were people who were discovering nature documentaries for the first time, I don't know. Personally, I found it to be the same as the shows we watch on the Natl. Geographic or Discovery channel. If you are a collector of animal documentaries or extreme penguin lover, then this DVD would be a great addition to your collection. Otherwise, I'd recommend renting over buying."
3,Sure It's Great Fun...But is it Original?,"So for the first hour I was hooked, seeing the lil' devils waddling around in their icy homeland. But then, at the end of the first act...WHAMMO! The ""surprise twist."" Which, frankly, took me off guard-- I definitely wasn't expecting it, but also haven't we seen this twist somewhere before? Oh, yes, about ten years ago, the same surprise happened in a movie called ""The Crying Game.""Definitely buy this movie if you like penguins and ""The Crying Game"" rip-offs."
3,"Good, but lacking something","I saw this movie in the theaters and I thought that the filming of this movie was wonderful, but it lacked factual information. I wouldn't call it a documentary, we learned very little about the penguins we just watched them for a period of time struggle with life."
4,Great Documentary,I had no idea that penguins were such interesting and fascinating creatures. This movie shows how penguins survive for a whole breeding cycle up until the babies are ready to be on their own. This process involves numerous excursions from the sea to the place they breed which is 70 miles away. It is interesting to discover the hardships involved just to hatch a baby penguin and take care of it in its younger months.The babies are cute and the waddling itself is enough to enjoy this movie- and you learn at the same time! Whats not to love?
1,Bored documentary lover,I recommend purchasing a documentary from National Geographic or PBS instead.
1,Very disappointing.,"I would much rather see a documentary on the work that went into this film than the film itself. It falls far short of what I expect from a nature documentary by pandering to the ""family-friendly"" crowd with its anthropomorphic narration and a very blinking eye.If you watch it with the sound turned down, it is gorgeous though."
2,For the Birds!!!,"Frankly I was underwhelmed........ it was quite repetitious. I found myself frequently consulting my watch throughout the movie and I love educational films!! Don't buy this ....if you think you must see it, do yourself a large favor and borrow it!"
1,WHERE ARE THE PENGUINS?,"I ordered two copies of this movie to be sent to two different relatives who live 5 miles apart - ONE and ONLY ONE has finallyreceived their movie - the other is still waiting for their movie - these movies were supposed to have been in stock and ready to delivery AT THE BEGINING OF JANUARY 06.So my review is ""I still don't see any Penguins""Other than that the MOVIE itself is great.Thanks - Michael"
4,An Intriguing Documentary,"I still find it pretty amazing how a documentary could end up being one of the summer of 2005's biggest money-makers. However, this is a great documentary, and there wasn't too much competition. March of the Penguins, narrated in English by Morgan Freeman (this is a French movie) tells the incredible story of what emporor penguins have to go through in order for their species to survive.Every year, emporor penguins across Antarctica have to trek over 70 miles from the edge of the continent to nearly the center of the continent, braving harsh conditions, in order to meet and mate with other penguins. And that is only the beginning.Beautifully photographed, it feels like we're there in Antarctica with the penguins (there are a few shots that I feel are a little TOO close), and wonderfully narrated by Freeman with moments of comedy to punctuate the ""drama"".While I wouldn't advise owning this, it is definitely worth watching once."
2,chronicle of cryonic excruciation,"It's cold, it's painfully cold. Inconceivably cold. And it's dark. And it'll get colder, and darker. But wait... it'll get colder and darker still! Are you still enjoying this? Yes, it's visually spectacular and probably wildly entertaining to eudyptologists obsessed with Kierkegaard. Coldness, pain and death. Horrible, endless sacrifice, generation after generation, leading to nothing but yet more endurance of boundless pain and ever-greater coldness. Endless, forced cryonic 70-mile Bataan death marches to and from a source of food. Actually, it feels rather like life under a Republican administration. But still... our own lives are painful enough. Who wants to see these poor birds mindlessly suffer, huddling against the 100-mph winds and hyperboreal onslaught of frigid death? Maybe there is nobility to be found in the observation of life in hell, but we're all too used to it. We need escape, respite, remission of agony... Not The Passion of Opus."
5,"Penguins, are you kidding? YES!","I first saw this on satellite and said ""what a wonderful movie."" At first, I thought my wife was crazy for ordering the movie, but as I watched it I was mesmerized. The most eloguent scene of the movie was the fathers sitting on the eggs for three months while the mothers hiked, skidded and swam for food. Seeing the fathers survive the horrible weather, darkness and hunger, with one mistake causing instant death for their little ones. The mothers had their own battles to fight. And with them not returning meant death for both dad and the chick.The time line of the movie made me recognize the hardships that the film crew had to go through in order to get the scenes filmed. Indeed, not only is the story the life of the penguins but the film crew as well.This is best animal story I have every seen. I totally recommend it for the family and especially those who think they have a rough life."
2,Inconsistencies and Typos,"...While understanding can come from this book, the numerous typos distract, confuse, and degrade the quality of it. Examples of this include the following: on page 7, the definitions for t_0 and t should be switched (although it's all relative); on pages 39, 40, and 41, there are occasions where a prime ' is either lacking or misplaced; on page 43, a variable dz' should be replaced by dx'. Page 137, example 4.5 (b) gives contradictory exponents. The correct exponents are ^2 throughout. The answer is also wrong! (should be 2.47x10^15 Hz)These are just a few occasions that I have noticed and have spent hours struggling with."
4,Immerse yourself in 1960s Canada!,"I really enjoyed this book. I liked the style and the setting of the '60s. It did drag a little (though I suppose I should have expected that in a book approaching 850 pages long!). The biggest disappointment was the final resolution - the plot wrapped around a murder that was left rather unmotivated, without much punishment or any satisfaction of final resolution. Still, it was an absorbing read, with a very unique style of writing that I really liked. I would definitely read more books by her, though I think it would be subject dependent because I liked the way she handled the young narrator much better than the older one. It was well-written and despite a few sections that could have been edited a bit better to cut down the length, the book flowed well and kept me up late reading it!"
4,Intense,"This is an intense and well crafted story about a murder that takes place on a Canadian Air Force base during the Cold War. It's a fast paced book that was impossible to put down. The historical references are excellent and helped to draw the reader into the story. My only complaint is that the last part of the book about Madeleine as an adult didn't move as quickly. Plus, the Bugs Bunny quotes and stand up comedy got a little annoying. But over all this is an excellent read."
1,One long writing exercise,"This book was selected to read by my book club. I was hoping for an interesting story however I should have known by its length that this book would turn out to be one long writing exercise usually required for a beginning creative writing class. An experienced writer knows how to get their point across, make the words flow and keep a reader captivated with fewer words. This story was filled up with any historical info the author could get her hands on. Add to that the creative writing exercises of how many different ways this writer could describe something led up to an exhausting read. Some authors get paid for each page they write so perhaps that's what happened here. This book should never have been published with more than 300 pages in it."
5,The Best Book I've Ever Read,"Ann-Marie MacDonald is a genius.She knows how to express the soul, how to connect with people.I personally believe that she must have been creating a sort of auto-biography, it is just too real, too vivid.Her descriptions made me cry.Although the beginning was content, and therefore a tad difficult to get through, once she hooks you, there's no turning back.I hope there's a sequel because i have become entirely attached to the characters, especially Madeleine.I would love to be friends with the Author, to discuss issues, but i feel inadequate.It is humbling.I love you Ann-Marie!!!!"
2,Loved the book until...,"How is it possible for an author to write such a great book and then completely destroy it all in the last 100 pages? I loved the characters, the nostalgia, the mystery until Madeleine grew up. Then I hated the characters. Every bit of love and charm was completely blown away. A loving marriage completely fizzles, a precocious and charming little girl becomes an obnoxious and self-absorbed adult. Friendships and families destroyed. Yea, yea. I know. It's all because of the murder, right? Whatever... And speaking of the resolution of the murder mystery. Are you kidding? If you choose to read this book, read until Madeleine grows up then skip to the end where the murder mystery is resolved. Use your own imagination to fill in the gaps. Better yet, stop BEFORE Madeleine grows up and ""finish"" the rest yourself."
4,Not a book I want to keep.,"Even though this book is for the most part highly readable, I kept wanting to put it down. I think this is due in part to the dark subject matter, but I also found myself tuning out to the tone of the narrators. Mixed feelings on this one..."
3,so so,There are several pages that seem to be a waste of time and reading. Thank goodness it came together in the end but way way way too long. Several hundred pages were not needed for the story.
3,Should Have a Warning Label for Disturbing Subject Matter,"The author is obviously talented though long-winded and very disturbing. I have read a lot of books. I read ""Fall on Your Knees"" but this is the first book that I have read that has given me nightmares. As another reader said, if you have problems reading about child sexual abuse, you may not want to read this book."
5,Econometrics explained not proved,"I own quite a lot of books on econometrics. But this one is I think one of the best. Not in technical detail, but in the clear intuitive explanations. If you want to study a subject by yourself, first read up the subject in this book. Only then move on to the mathematical details in others. Besides the clear presentation of subjects, the excellent real world examples are a great help to gain an understanding. Last but not least, the text put more emphasis on cross-section and panel-data than is usual. Unless youre only interested in macro-econometric modelling this is an approach I warmly endorse. Is there no point of critique? A minor one: the appendices might be shortened, but I imagine others will find them helpfull."
4,the woman can sing!,"Very refreshing to hear a ""new"" singer sounding like one of the great soul vocalists from the 1970s. Of course, Sharon Jones is no sweet young thing who just burst upon the scene, but a singer who has paid her dues over the years. And man, can she sing! One of those vocalists who BELTS out a song and leaves you breathless. Sweet and sassy, fiery and funky; this is the real thing. And her band the Dap-Kings are VERY adept at playing their instruments; a tight band that knows where to place the groove. This was my first introduction to the music of Sharon Jones and I enjoyed it. Some of the songs might be a tad derivative, but all in all this is a most impressive performance."
4,Excellent for younger players....,"and especially for coaches of younger players. This book reviews lots of fundamentals and is written in a pretty straight-forward, easy to read manner. It is not for the college level player, but anyone below that will find at least 1 pearl here worth remembering."
2,Can't Hear Timer Ring,"I have two West Bend timer products. Their concepts are great. Both of them have a fundamental problem. I would return them but it is not worth my time or effort. The fundamental problem is that with the refrigerator motor, perhaps television being on or perhaps the microwave running you cannot hear the timer ringing. In most cases, it does not take much ambient sound to drown out the ringing of the timer. It is certainly not suitable for the kitchen. I would not recommend this timer's purchase."
3,Good and cheap,"V.good game, but in view of MW3 in place, it may not amuse gamers. Still worth the money. I may rate 3 stars."
3,Enh,"It's padded and dated, with lots of material recycled from The Gift of Fear and not a lot of actionable information (so if my neighbors don't have furniture, I guess I should report them to the police as potential terrorists? OK, I'll get right on that). This book would be probably helpful for somebody with a pathological fear of terrorism but it's really not interesting to a general audience. There is also a conspicuous lack of coverage on racial profiling and racism against/fear of Arabs and Muslims."
2,DISAPPOINTED!,The first book I read from Mr. DeBecker was excellent. This book was very disappointing because it seemed to capitalize on the 9/11 market.Filled with re-written common sense information and tactics this book was a rush to get to the presses.Hopefully his next writing will have more thought and compassion before it goes of to the presses.
2,Strange read,"What a strange little book. I don't know how I came to buy it, but I guess we all make mistakes. It's not a horrible book, just pretty plain and borderline boring. Bland characters. Bland story. Bland premise."
1,LEGAL AUDIO BOOKS,"Having low vision and enjoying legal format, I purchased this. It is very slow as to the story line and a disappointment."
5,Great pen!,"I needed this for a memoir I'm writing, which is to be a family heirloom. I recommend this to anyone wanting a reliable permanent pen."
4,Uni Ball pens what I expected,"The pens were what I expected. Best price I could find, however, I received an email from amazon advertising an even better deal...havn't looked closely yet at that ad since I already had 6 packs of these pens...my fav penshttp://www.amazon.com/dp/B000FDR47E/ref=pe_57250_26009220_pe_vfe_dt1these for 10.50/12....best deal yet Ive seen"
2,Inconsistent,"I can't tell you why, but half the time these pens don't work well for me. Maybe its because I don't use them regularly and the ink dries. Maybe it's my writing style. For whatever reason, sometimes these are smooth for me, sometimes they are only marginally better than cheap bic pens that are 1/10th the price."
4,Nice writing,"These pens write very nicely and the ink is very smooth. Only downfall is that they don't last as long as other pens, but for the writing quality it's worth it."
2,Highly Disappointed,"These pens came highly recommended, and I am entirely disappointed. The ink is inconsistent -- guaranteed that one+ letter in every sentence will be missing ink. I discovered the Sarasa Zebra 0.7 for even less cost, and this pen never has hiccups -- will be ordering a box of those instead."
4,Great lightweight Hammock,This Hammock Has a 250 lb weight limit but I weigh 285 and it holds up great. It's very relaxing and pretty comfortable. It could be wider though thats the only reason i didn't give it 5 stars.
3,"Nice Hammock, tears easily!","I enjoyed this hammock very much while it lasted. Because it is so light, there is not much in the way of protection. I was relaxing in it and as I swung I was lightly scraping on something. I noticed a little tear and moved the hammock immediately. But too late, because the next time I used it the tiny tear ripped the entire distance across the hammock, and I fell to the ground. So yes, it was ""user error"" because I was not more careful in my hammock placement. But I will not buy one again because I need something a little more durable- I do not want to ""relax"" while constantly worrying if I will fall to me doom."
1,Don't buy,"I am 165 lbs and was very careful getting in and out. It just exploded after about five uses. Junk,"
5,Great Buy!,"I bought this hammock just to have on my back porch--it is ridiculously easy to set up, takes about 30 seconds, and is very comfortable! I would highly recommend it to anyone who is looking for an inexpensive hammock. I haven't taken it camping, but I can tell it would work great out in the woods. Very sturdy, breathes well, and allows you to toss and turn without falling out!"
4,Exceeded My Expections for a $20 hammock,"We purchased two of these hammocks and have used them a couple of times. They've held close to 200lbs and so far, so good. They are extremely lightweight and pack up easily in their little pouch, but yet they actually keep us pretty warm. Since they are so lightweight, I would probably not recommend them for long-term use for larger people. My hubby and I are both under 150 and have smaller builds and these are perfect for us and our young boys. In fact, there's enough fabric to drape over us to keep heat in. These come with rope and can be put in very quickly. We plan on buying several and having them on hand. The only reason these don't get a 5-star rating is because I wish the fabric was just a bit thicker. I'd give 4.5 stars if could! :)"
3,alright,"its a good hammock but not meant to stay on it for a long while......it gets uncomfortabel, but thats just my opinion."
4,Great Hammock,"The hammock is quality material. Everyone who tries it out want to buy one just like it! Doesn't seem big but once you lay in it, you realize it is very large."
1,A HEADS UP TO ANYONE LOOKING TO PURCHASE,"I am writing this review to alert people looking for a hammock. First off, prepare yourself because this hammock does not come with anything to hang it with. You need separate lines to use because it only comes with S-hooks at either end. Secondly and mostly importantly if you do end up buying it you really GET WHAT YOU PAY FOR. After two days of light use I (a 150 lbs male) fell straight through it when I went to lay down one morning while camping. So despite its claim it can take up to 250 lbs. I wouldn't trust it with anyone over 100 lbs. I wanted to right this review to let people know that this product is horrible, and if your looking for a long-lasting dependable hammock that has everything you are looking for right out of the package look elsewhere."
4,Good,This hammock is great because it can be folded up into it's own bag. Very comfortable and portable. Plan to buy another one.
5,Buy This! It's a No Brainer,"This was my first hammock in attempting this new sleep system for camping and I was not disappointed. I went out to buy an ENO Double Nest hammock, but still find myself using this one whenever I do multi-day trips because it is so much lighter and less bulky. I can fit my suspension system, 2 8' pieces of webbing and my hammock and it is still smaller than the ENO itself. This hammock has proved to be pretty durable. For the price, this is the best hammock hands down."
2,Disappointed,I always thought Levi's were made in America. Sorry to find out they like many others (what used to be) quality products are not and lacking in quality and workmanship. These pants are thin materialed and will wear out in 3 months.
2,Mismarked Levis,"I purchased 2 pair of Levi 505s 33"" waist, 29"" length. The pants were both marked 29L and 33W. The 29"" length was correct, but 1 pair has a 34"" waist and the other has a 35"" waist. I kept them because when I was young, Levis shrank when 1st washed. I was wrong!"
2,505's not what they used to be,"Levi stopped offering 505's in the colors that they used to. They also offer less sizes then they used to. I have worn 505's for years. 36 waist and 29 inch leg. But now Levi's offers fewer of the color choices in a 36 waist and 29 inch leg. I can't prove it but the material seems lighter to me as well. Unless I want 505's in my size in shades of blue I am out of luck. To summarize, less choice in colors of my size and cheaper lighter materials used."
2,Bye-bye Levi.,"Levi Strauss sold out; and their Levi jeans are the worse for it. Thin material. Poorly made (by Egyptians.) Worst of all, they've let ""fashion designers"" take over. Jean styles are now designed for the skinny, hang-down-your pants customer. The 505 fit, in spite of being called ""Regular,"" is not; this ""updated version"" is not the sit-at-your waist, straight leg jean we all used to buy, wear and love. Levi has moved-on; they've changed their jeans ... and obviously, have decided to leave their existing customer behind."
5,perfect,"Man, these jeans are cool, they fit just right, light stonewash rocks.....Levis are the best !....Delivered on time, in sturdy box, will buy more."
4,Men's 505 Levi's,I was nervous about buying something I usually try on. The Levi's fit comfortably and it was nice that they came to me instead of having to go shopping.
1,Not the same old 505s,"Heed other's reviews. These are now lower cut. Had to return them after wearing the 505s for 10 years. And trust me , I am not any bigger than I was then.The jeans just don't fit the same."
1,dont comply,"The size marked on the pants did not correspond to reality, they were one sise bigger.I ordered two pants one blue and one beige. I received two beige. I had to return one of the beige. They send me the blue one one week later. This worked ok.I could not use them because were one size bigger than the size marked. I sold then to a friend."
2,Levis Quality Gone - No Longer Worth The Price,"I've owned Levis my whole life which spans five decades. But the last four pairs I bought barely lasted a year before they wore out or started falling apart. These are jeans right? Could fool me.I had not given this much thought but saw a friend of mine who is in the construction trade and he was wearing what looked like really well constructed jeans and I mentioned my Levis problem and he said in a matter of fact way that few people in the trades buy Levis anymore as they cost more but don't last anywhere near as long as some other brands.So from my point of view, Levis is another example of the current management charging too much and cutting too many corners to make a buck. I will not buy Levis again and am sad to see this brand go down the toilet."
2,You'll like these if you're a Hipster...,"I've hardly ever been as annoyed with a product as I am with these jeans. I've worn the same size 505 Levi's for probably 25 years. So I had no qualms about ordering these online. But they are cut completely differently than any other pair of 505's I've ever owned. Low at the hip and skinnier in the thighs.If Levi Strauss is trying to tell me I'm not hip, I get the message. But if you're going to label something 505, it should be the same jean I've always worn and loved.Change the flipping name if you change the product. It's not like you only have one jean..."
4,Bought a black and blue pair,Product came in timely. The jeans are nice but the quality is just not what it used to be. The denim seems thinner. The black pair fit a lot better than the blue pair. The blue pair are a little tight around the thighs. Both were 36 waist. My other jeans which are 36 waist fit fine.
1,New Coke of jeans,"Some genius MBA at Levis decided to change the design of the classic 505 jeans without telling anybody. I bought several pairs before realizing they weren't seconds, Levis had actually made the waist wider and the rise lower so the pants will no longer fit no matter how tight you cinch your belt. Do not buy these without trying them on! Levis has taken a style you could buy without worry and made it unwearable -- without warning any of its customers.Levi's Men's 505 Straight Fit Jean"
1,"Poor sizing, Poor finish","I have been wearing these, the Levi 505, for quite sometime now and I love them. I ordered some on Amazon because they were in a wash that I couldn't find in the store. When I got them, I put them on and they were literally HUGE! I compared them to some other new 505's and the sizing was awful. They were literally 2 inches too long, and at least 2 sizes too big in the waist. I felt like I put on my dad's jeans!In addition, one of the seams was coming undone already. Very poor finish."
3,They are ok,"Gotta say, they don't make Levi's the way they used to. I remember the denim was so thick and sturdy they lasted for years. Now they wear like any other pants material. The thing I don't like about these is the short waste. You can't sit or bend over without exposing your rear, and I hate that. I'm constantly pulling and tugging on them and I have just given up on the fit. I gotta say all of the Levi cuts seam to be the same, with the low waste. They look like ladies jeans any more with the exposed midrif. I'm not looking for something rediculously high wasted but I'm tired of feeling a draft!"
4,great fit,Bought these jeans for my husband.He likes the narrower legs these jeans have.Nice to be able to get them online.
2,"I purchased the Levi's Men's 505 Regular Fit Jean, Dark Stonewash","The style is inconsistent in some sizes. When I bought the pants, the picture associated with the style, was misplaced. It is now corrected. The pants are bulky... with no style. The color is a mixture of generic blue and some white-ish threads like something you would find in old outlet stores. I am a fan of Levi's but this particular one, is not my cup of tea."
2,Quality Control Needs to Improve,"Updated with info on the reordered pair....Again a quality control issue. This time the waist fit ok, but the length was 2 inches longer than the other pair.I didn't believe all of the reviews about poor quality control until I experienced it myself. I am currently wearing a pair of these Jeans. I love them. They are super comfortable and fit great; therefore, I ordered a 2nd pair in the exact same size.The jeans arrive and they do not fit right.If you get a pair that fits right, then the Jeans are 5 stars, but if you don't then it's annoying and frustrating (hence the 2 star ranking). I have already reordered the jeans and will be returning the ""defective"" pair that I received. Yes, it's annoying, but Amazon's return policy makes it super easy."
3,Good jeans but inconsistent sizing,"As others have noted, the sizes seem to vary. Even though I ordered the same size as 4 or 5 other pair of Levis 505 that fit me fine, these are loose around the waist. I don't like wearing belts."
2,What's going on Levi's??,"What's going on Levi's??? Are paying attention to our opinions??? I am a good'ol Levi's costumer, buying tru Amazon and I was going to buy a 505, but not after all these reviews; I have used other models and in the last few years, the guys are right!, manufacturing and materials have been changing a lot, depending on the place or country where the jeans were manufactured; well our opinion are important, so what's going on Levi's, do you want us to quit??"
2,Is it reallllllllly Levi's ????,"Probably this was the last time I ordered Levi's online from Amazon.I got two pairs of Levi's jeans (505) in the same shipment and both have extremely different fitting, none close to the Levi's I know for so long. Now I am wondering why I was so lazy not to go to the local Levi's store..... My advice, if you can get out of your sofa and visit a local Levi's store, it would be worth...."
2,"The name is the same, the quality fades faster than the denim","I've been wearing these for more than 40 years (501-505's) the denim continues to get lighter, the material flaws more frequent, and the sizing more random.I'm done with the whole Levi's thing. For my money, there are better, longer wearing options."
3,They don't make them like they used to,"I have worn the Levi brand for over 40 years and nearly everyday of those 40 years. I loved them for their durability and fit. Unfortunately, I have noticed lately that the quality of my Levi's have been declining causing them to wear out quicker. This last pair of jeans I bought were the worst. The material is extremely thin and cheap feeling - they aren't the Levi's I am accustomed to. I also noticed that Levi's is not making as many styles as they previously had previously. This may be the last pair of Levi's I purchase. A sad day for the Levi's, formerly an icon of quality and customer satisfaction."
2,Way too long!,"I ordered a size 35x32. And that is what the tag said it was when it arrived. But, they were not a 32 length. They were about 2 to 3 inches longer! I was surprised by this, because Levi has always been good with sizing. I would normally be able to order my size and have no problems."
2,"Levi's has changed the design, size is not the same","These jeans have changed in design! We buy the same size Levi's every year and these two pair that I just purchased are way too small. The waist and length is the same as always, but the thigh is way too tight. It barely fits over his leg! Maybe they are trying to make skinny jeans. These are definitely not traditional 505's. Very disapointed."
4,Nice Jean,This is a nice jean. It is a lighter weight which I really like especially as the warm weather approaches. The lighter material seems to come out of the dryer more wrinkled than the heavier 505.
4,good,"Trousers is good, work is very good, I like it, next time will also come to buy, a satisfactory shopping experience"
5,Finally - a waist rider,"This version turned out to be perfect. Not only does the material feel good, the waist seat has been positioned correctly - not the versions which allow no room for the package."
1,Levi's Changed The Fit,"I just bought a pair of ""505 Straight Fit"" jeans and will have to return them. (They used to be called ""505 Regular Fit"" but Levi's no longer offers jeans so marked.)Levi's has changed the cut of these jeans since I last bought them. They're now cut to ride an inch lower than they used to, and have less waist definition -- OK if you're fat, or if you like to wear your jeans six inches below your natural waist. Ghetto jeans, anyone?"
1,505 is not the same anymore--look elsewhere,"Like many others have said, the 505 is now called the ""straight"" fit from the ""regular"" fit with no information provided on why or what changes were made. Therefore you buy the jeans thinking it is the old style but it is not, this one is supposed to be a hip hugger jean I guess. Why Levis did not just come up with another number for these lowriders I do not know, but what you get with the new 505 is not what you are going to like wearing.I finally went with the Premium Performance Wrangler regular fit and it is fine. Too bad since I have worn Levis for many years, but no more. Plus the lack of rivets in the back, lack of belt loops. Just not a good product anymore.They say other Levi jeans will work, they do not work so I can only recommend to the buyers here to try them on at a local store before you buy a Levis product and be sure it is really what you want.LDW120"
1,The Death of Yet Another Great American Brand.,"I'm completely exasperated, disgusted and hopeless. These are entirely unacceptable. There's nothing ""good old blue"" about them. They're made of poor quality ""denim"" that bears no resemblance to Levi's good old denim. They look cheap and greasy, like some off-brand discount junk. In addition, they don't fit. They're almost 2 inches smaller than the stated waist size, as compared with the Levi's 505's of a couple of years ago. They're essentially hip-huggers--no room in the crotch. Worst, they're made in China. I'll spare the essay on Chinese trade and labor practices and simply remind readers of the frequent, nay, routine problems with the quality of Chinese-made goods, of which these are a prime example. I've trusted Levi's for over 40 years and have worn 505's since the 70's. No more. These represent the death of yet another great American brand. Without Levi's in the market, whither blue jeans?"
2,"Warning, Levi's have changed!","I've been buying 505's for many years; I could hardly believe my recent order was supposedly the same product. The material is *much* thinner than it was even a couple years ago, and overall they look like flimsy knockoff copies of the genuine article. If you are considering buying these, don't just take my word for it, look at the other reviews that discuss the dramatic recent drop in quality; ignore these only at your own peril, like I foolishly did. The only consolation is that for $22 a piece, they are not such a bad deal for generic casual pants and as such I will probably not endure the hassle of returning them, but had I paid anything close to list price I would have felt royally ripped-off. They will certianly be the last Levi's I ever buy, however. Too bad, it feels kind of like losing an old friend."
2,They are not the same as the original 505,"I have bought many 505s over the years. In the last 2 months, Levis changed the name of the straight leg 505s to ""straight fit"" AND shorted the distance between the crotch and waistline by 2 inches. They are now low-riders. This was verified by a Levis rep I met at Macys. Guess they figure to save money by using less material. This is not just from Amazon but all original 505s are pretty much gone. If you want real dungarees to work in look elsewhere. Oh... and try before you buy. This is my first and last online purchases of clothes."
2,The size that I always wear was not ok this time,"Recently I bought a 550 relaxed fit pair of Levi's Jean (33*30) and the waist was ok but they were a bit long so in this ocassion I tried the 505 (33*29) and they were too tigh at waist but the leg size was ok. I learn it is necessary to consider the fit type, not only the size which is a bit strange as my old pair of Levi's 555 (33*30)(not currently available) were ok. The fabric is thick and there is not complaint about the material but the sizing is a bit tricky. Sizes across the different fits should be ok but it seems not. A relative, chubbier than I, actually has a 505 (33*30) which are ok, so there seems to be sizing problems with this jean."
3,"It's Ok ,But Not a Heavy Duty Jeans","It's Lite wight Jeans, I don't think that This Levi's Quality is for long term and trusted working jean, I ordered A Lee Denim it's much more a Heavy duty one, After all I don't Under-rate this Levi's the good things it look good and great for Summer like here in my country and the most of all it came Cheap."
3,hi,"good day, because I know why they did not send my purchase is several days and have not sent Thanks for any help."
2,"Watch out for the ""fit"" descriptions","Heads up on the fit (regular, original, etc) descriptions. Unclear why Levi's felt compelled to alter the fits on these long established styles (501, 505) but they did. What you used to buy is not what you're getting. Couldn't find a notice or explanation on any Levi's site, so you're on your own."
2,poor fit,the fit was to loose totaly disappointed. won't buy chlothes on here again. same size from store fits just fine.
5,love levi's,"I am a woman who loves wearing men's levi's in this fit (or 555, 501, 565). I had gastric bypass and just like how they hang and the weight/thickness of the jean material. Most women's jeans are thinner, shallow pockets and have spandex, which I don't need. I like the tighter fit, seems to keep everything tight. And without the spandex, the jeans are warmer for the colder climes. I've always been a levi's fan!!!"
1,so thin,I always get 505 but these pants material is so thin Levi's lately use thin and poor materials that this is my last pair of pants from levis will never buy levies again.
3,Men's Levi's,"There were two pictures on the Amazon website regarding these jeans. One was a newer style with darker top-stitching and silver brads. The other was an older style with definite goldish-brown distinct top-stitching and brass-colored brads. That was the one that I chose, but I was sent the other ones. They are not made quite as well as the older style, which was what I ordered."
1,Slow delivery and wrong size.,The jeans were very Slow in getting to me and they were way too big. I buy the same size each time for my husband and these were way too big.
1,Don't bother,"If you are buying a pair of Levi's because you are a loyal customer, don't waste your time. They looked cheap and were paper thin. What a disappointment, sent them back."
2,decline in quality,"I have worn Levi jeans and other apparel for about 70 years. They first quit making the jeans without the matching white and blue seam which I can see was quite an added expense. They also Quit using real leather pocket tags, also very expensive. 'They then quit honoring the ""If they rip, we replace then"". The material gradually became thinner and the jeans didn't last very long compared to the originals that were usually handed down to about the third child in the family. The last straw was this latest pair I puchased after several years of avoiding Levis and they now have only 5 belt loops which makes them hang between the loops and don't look good at all. Basicly I'm saying Goodbye To Levi jeans for good!"
2,Did they change the sizes,"I have not bought Levis brand in some time, in large part because of their discontinued support of the Boy Scouts. After more than 10 years, I thought i would try them again. Ordered my size that I have been wearing for 30 years and have bought recently in other brands like Lands End and Eddie Bauer. Got my levis and they keep coming down in the back, like they shortened the rise in the rear an inch. No problems with the same ""traditional"" fit in the other brands. So I don't think it was me that changed.So when did Levis change their sizes for 505's?"
3,Levis Straight Fit 505 different than Regular fit 505,"I bought the $28 Staight/regular fit 505's thinking they were just like any 505 regular fit jeans. They're not the same. Inside the waist, the tag says ""Staight fit"" instead of ""regular fit"". They are made n Mexico and fit differntly than all my other 505 jeans. They fit looser in the waist."
1,505s,"What is wrong with you people? I have bought and worn 505 regular fit jeans all my life. Now for some unknown reason you have decided to discontinue this very cut. The closest I can get is the straight cut and they suck. They are crotch bound and uncomfortable. They are designed for the people who wear them around their ass. No thank you, you have lost a good costumer."
1,Legs are too long!,"I ordered these Levi's size 42"" x 29"". Not an easy size to always find. But they arrived with the tag that indeed listed the size as 42"" x 29"". It tried them on. They seemed too long. I took them off and measured the inseam. It was 30 1/2"" rather than 29"". I boxed them up and returned them. It makes me hesitant to order jeans online. Better to go in the store and try them on."
2,Levi 505s,"I have been wearing Levi 505 jeans for several years and like the fit. I recently bought two pair of Levi 505 jeans, same size. When the jeans arrived I noticed they were manufactured in two different oversea's locations. To my surprise, one pair was too small and the other too large. I returned both pair with no problems; I'm going to try one more time and if they don't fit this time guess I'll end up going to the mall."
1,Levis must have changed their measurement specs.,My old 29x34s are much smaller in both waist and length compared to the new and returned 29x34s. What other brands are there that are really 29x34?
1,Not a reliable brand anymore,"What you read in recent reviews of Levi 505s is true- they have changed the sizing a LOT & your old size won't fit you anymore.For years I've bought 33 x 32. I never even bothered to try them on- they always fit nicely. Sadly the last 2 pair I bought fitpoorly- the problem, as many others have pointed out is that they ride too low on the waist. I'll be shopping for Lee or Wrangler next time I buy jeans."
2,Another former customer,"I was a loyal Levis wearer for decades. I even put up with the ""coolness tax,"" the higher price that Levis command only because of the famous brand name. Those days have passed, though.The ""new"" 505s are made from something a lot lighter and less durable than before. It seems like only a few weeks before the back pockets blow out, forcing me to buy again. In fact, older Levis with the heavier material are in better shape than the new ones, with less wear on them. A well-known competing brand still uses the heavier cloth, so that's where I'm buying now. If Levi went back to something more rugged, I might consider buying them again - but I really don't have time or patience to go around checking all the features of all the brands. I'd rather just go to the store, buy what I know, and be done with it.Bye-bye, Levi. We had good times together, but that's the past. I have a future to get on with.-- wiredweird"
3,NOT THE SAME OLD LEVIS,I'VE WORN LEVIS MY ENTIRE LIFE SO FAR AND WHEN THEY WENT OVERSEAS (STOPPED BEING MADE IN THE US OF A) THE QUALITY WENT WAY DOWN HILL. IT'S STILL SLIDING TOO!
3,No more brand loyalty,"Others, have said this, but I'll add my voice to the chorus: Although there is nothing intrinsically wrong with these jeans, they bear little resemblance to the 505s I've been buying for many years. The fit is tighter, and the fabric is much thinner. Now I'll have to waste time trying to determine if another brand offers something closer to the good old 505s."
4,This review is wrote in german...,"Das erste Album - ""Berserker"" - war schon eine Krönung das Dark-Metal, aber ""Sichtum"" übertrifft die genialität (bes. textlich) des Vorgängers noch ein Stück... Während mir das erste Sück eher wie eine Selbstbeweiraucherung vorkam, ist der zweite Track ""Und süß setzt ein das Leiden"" das BESTE Stück von Karsten...so ausgedrückt -und musikalisch untermalt- habe ich noch nie einen Text -der vor Todessehnsucht nur son strotzt- erlebt. Nur allein wegen diesem Stück ist schon der Kauf der Scheibe zu empfelen...sowas geniales gibt's nur selten...aber auch ""Morella"", ""Violine mit Knochenkopf"", ""Barbados"" und ""Sichtum"" überzeugen mit guter Komposition und hervorragenden Texten. Eine weitere Ausnahmestellung nimmt ""Hort des Sterbens"" ein... welcher noch einen Tick besser als die Vorgänger rüberkommt -nur, ""Und süß..."" erreicht es nicht ganz..."
2,Maybe you will happier if you change?,"The light-hearted descriptions of the contributors makes this an entertaining read- and more interestingly contributor Shauna Marsh's popular online [...] reveal the simultaneously secretive and extroverted dual-identity of a blogger for whom weight loss is both a public and private journey. Like her blogs, her contribution to this book is filled with anecdotes full of personal triumphs and humorous mishaps but overall I found the authors of book more self-obsessed than inspirational."
5,A classic for starter sailors,"As Chapman Piloting is for americans, for europeans the reference-starter guide to sailing is Glenans. Recently updated, Philippe Harle shows his years of seamanship, design and teaching into that book. A different insight on sailing for American people, a must for european sailors."
3,Disappointing,"For years I've wanted to see this story. Now I have seen it. It was, at best, OK. But, I would have rather not been so disappointed."
4,Champion Starting Blocks,Starting blocks are great! Set up is easy and fast. I just wish that there was somewhere on the blocks to secure or store the pins and post.
1,what a waste of time,"When I saw the three authors on the cover of this book, I was quite excited. But, OMG, this is one of the worst books I have ever read. Sherrilyn Kenyon's story started off really well then descended into a few pages of ranting about authors who have to write or end up on antidepressants???!!!!???? The other two stories were so below average. Thank goodness for authors like Charlaine Harris, JR Ward and Emma Holly who can write well crafted and fascinating stories."
5,Another Great Review,"Everyone else has said it already, but I want to add my vote. The NY album is better than the London album, and conveys the meaning of the show I saw in New York. There are times this show brought tears to my eyes, and the album does the same. You can't see the show anymore, and the spectacular Raul Esparza has moved on. Hopefully he'll get the part that makes him a household name soon, because he deserves it. Buy this, or miss it at your own risk."
2,Disappointing,"The search for a good corded phone has become difficult in this wireless world. I tried this Panasonic phone, which seemed adequate, but am now finding that I need to replace it after 15 months of use. The Caller ID display was always annoying because it is not back lit, but within 12 months of use it failed completely. The digital letters and numbers are reduced to broken lines and dots and is unreadable. I also found that the set up of functions was not intuitive. I will continue my search for quality phone systems."
4,PANASONIC KX-TS620B,"While reviewing multiple phones, I saw the pluses and shortcomings on numberous models. Everything I've read on this model is true, but it serves my purpose for a home phone. I simply purchased a small light to see who is calling me late in the evening to address the most addressed issue in the reviews."
4,good phone,"i think this is a pretty basic business type phone. i wanted the built in digital answering component and it performs perfectly. the hold music is awful though. Sounds like it was borrowed from a infants musical mobile that hangs above cribs. But it can turn off. I do wish i could have a selection of better hold music or be able to link to my itunes. but overall, good phone for $50."
2,3 minute messages and no battery backup,"Although the product information says that it is 15 minute recording time -- that is for total of all messages at one time (including outgoing message). Each individual incoming message can be no longer than 3 minutes. When listening to messages remotely you have to hit 6 key strokes to delete a message. There is no battery backup, so whenever there is a power outage you have to reprogram everything. The message screen is not back lit.Update: The incoming message feature stopped working Jan 2013 so I did get over 5 years usage. However, I did not like it enough to replace it with the same one."
4,Good Phone,"The only problem that I have with this phone is that you can't totally mute the ringer. Otherwise, it does exactly what I want."
2,Can't push on it,"I bought this based on the great reviews that I saw on Amazon. I've had it for several months now. It is sturdy and powerful, but what I don't like about it is that when you have it in it's normal, straight position and push hard on the end of it to put pressure on the the screw that you are trying to put in or take out, the screw driver collapses into it's bent, L shaped orientation. There is no way to lock it into a straight orientation. Frustrating. Also it didn't come with a normal screw attachment, only one for Philips screws. What's up with that?"
5,Great.....,Nice working with this driver and have everyone at work wanting to borrow it. It is perfect for electrical panel building and many small assembly jobs. The battery life is great and the weight to torch is excellent! So if you are buying an entertainment center to a desk this baby will put it together fast. It's very nice.....
2,Disappointed,"I got this tool to replace my old Black and Decker (its old technology NI-Cad battery died and couldn't be replaced). The Hitachi has plenty of torque, an almost useful LED to light what you're doing, and the bits change easily. It does not have variable speed, so it is somewhat difficult to use in certain situations. My biggest complaint is that after about 1.5 years, the unit failed. First, the tool began to work intermittently (motor? switch?), so just when you get it positioned and ready to use, nothing happened. Finally, the clutch completely stripped. I don't suppose that I'll get another of these."
4,Perfect tool for small jobs,"I bought this driver because I got tired of hauling out the much larger one just to change a few screws (or whatever). It's a lot more convenient in areas where the larger driver wouldn't fit easily. The torque control helps me avoid stripping screw heads when a screw sticks in a tight space. The ergonomics feel good so far--having an articulated handle makes this driver a lot easier to use than a regular screwdriver. I haven't owned it long enough to fully test the lithium ion batteries, but I'm assuming they will be a better alternative than nickel cadmium."
1,Beware - Weak Clutch,The clutch on my unit stripped the first time I used it. I had it set at maximum and was driving a 1.5 inch screw into pine with a pilot hole - very disappointing. I have used Hitachi tools in the past and loved them (their router is the best). This one needs a little more work from Hitachi to meet the quality level of their other tools.
2,I have not yet used this item,I have not yet used this item as there was only one philips head bit and not flat head. Could you please see that I get one? Thank you
4,Great tool for light duty.,I bought this for my wife to keep in the house. She loves this drill/screw gun. Its light weight yet plenty powerful for most light-duty projects. It doesn't have the torque to drive long screws into a wall stud so don't buy it for heavy duty uses. The battery charges quickly and holds a charge for many weeks between uses.
4,Cordless Screwdriver,"I looked at several mfg. of cordless screwdriver to use in electrical work. I wanted something light, with two batteries and had variable speed, the Hitachi is two speeds as with most drivers in this class. I looked at the new Makita but for half the price the Hitachi was the winner hands down. This was the most cost effective screwdriver on the market that met my needs. Saves my wrists every time I use it when high speed drivers are not practical and you need point control when working in electrical panels.Only draw back that makes it a 4 star is that the switch is very sensitive. I do like the fact that the switch is a dual function for forward and reverse so you don't have to push another switch for reverse."
4,Informative and easy to read,"This book presents a lot of potentially confusing information in an easy-to-read format with practical examples. It apporpriately encourages you to use the book as a starting point for talking with an estate planning professional. This isn't a ""how to"" book. You'll be a much more informed consumer of estate planning services if you read this book"
3,Missing Daughter,"Jacqueline Winspear's BIRDS OF A FEATHER does not carry the same punch as her opener, MAISIE DOBBS. Many of the characters seem overdrawn in the extreme and a few resolutions seem too pat with little substance providing an avenue to the said.The reader never learns how choices were made in the beginning to precipate later events.It is a good read with insight into a world few of can imagine today, but just doesn't have the strength of the previous title. I've read later books in the series and they have a much greater impact on the development of the story.Nash Black, author of SANDPRINTS OF DEATH."
2,"'Elp, 'Elp!","If you're interested in reading a book where every character is a flaming stereotype, this is your cup of tea.We have everything--the incapacitated lover, the crusty old dad, the Cockney employee with his wife and little nippers, the royal benefactress and the scholarly mentor. Maisie Dobbs, self-styled psychologist, meditation expert, investigator, and all-around know-it-all, has been hired to find the daughter of a successful London merchant.Along the way, she manages to diagnose and solve her employee's little substance abuse problem, come to a new and enlightened understanding of her relationship with her father, share with us the quaint religious customs of ""Dame Constance"", and solve three murders! And all without eating anything!If I've missed the point and this was written completely tongue-in-cheek, I'd have to give it a 5...Otherwise, give it a miss."
5,Excellent!,"I wouldn't classify myself as a mystery reader. However, after stumblingonto the Mary Russell books three years ago as a result of a book club recommendation, I have found myself very carefully choosing mysteries in the same genre - strong female characters, different time period. I selected this series at the recommendation of Amazon reader reviews. This series is better crafted than the Fremont Jones mysteries (I like those, too). Once I started this book I couldn't put it down. Loaned it to my mother - and she quickly read it and told all her friends, declaring it her favorite for the year. Highly recommended."
2,Non-standard Size,"I ordered this, only to find that it is a non-standard size -- 3/4"" not the common 5/8"" quick connect size that is widely available. Otherwise, the product looked great, though I was never able to use it find out for sure."
4,Combi base,"The base seems to be high quality. It is sturdy and easy to install. It is very easy to attach and unattach the car seat. Other than being pricey, there is no complaints."
2,Did not receive what was advertised,"This Scorpius P7 keyboard is advertised as a PS/2 keyboard, but what was received was a USB keyboard. The supplier claims that they only have USB style keyboards and that they ship USB to PS/2 adapters with the PS/2 versions. I decided to find another supplier."
2,It's rather empty.,This was a very short book whose ideas could have been summarized in a pamphlet. The ideas are very simple and not overly useful. It didn't inspire me at all and I was really disappointed with the lack of depth. Some of the pages only have three words on them. Save your money!
2,"Vague, Undescriptive, yet strangely confidence building","With advice like ""1. Smile"".. I was immediately turned off to this book as soon as I opened it. Much of the advice it gives is kinda dull and useless, and few of them are things a normal mental ward patient couldn't have come up with. I wouldn't recommend it, unless you live in a cave, and are unsure what real people look like."
1,terrible,"don't waste your money, this book was atrocious. I made it to the first ten pages and gave up."
3,Just not really my style,"I picked this up because I have been reading some Kerouac books recently, but I wasn't a fan of this book's style, so overall it really just wasn't for me, still finished it though so it wasn't horrible."
4,Pretty good.,"I did a fair amount of research before purchasing a sub-$100 portable DVD player. I have to admit that I'm pleasantly surprised with the quality and durability of this Memorex player so far. This is a ''box-ier'' player than some, but it is made out of a harder plastic and just ''feels'' more durable than many other players I've hefted. It plays the basics (DVD, CD-R/RW, audio CD), but no DIVX and no DVD-R. Only ONE headphone jack but there are coaxial and S-video out ports. The player opens ''flat,'' so that you can mount the unit in one of those over-the-seat holsters for backseat vechicle viewers. You'll have to buy your own car lighter adapter for this player, but you do get a regular AC/DC adapter, a rechargeable battery and small remote packed in. The player has not crashed or froze since I've used it and is quieter than other players I've tested in person. Battery lasts well over 2 hours. Overall a very good player."
3,Harmful Inrent,"Good, but did not seen to be as exciting as the authors other medical thrillers, I have read. Interesting theory, though."
1,Don't waste your time or money,This novel relies too much on far fetched ideas and coincidences. I thought it was boring.
3,Suspenseful medical thriller.,"I like the ring of authenticity about Cook's medical knowledge; this makes the book exciting. I enjoyed the book thoroughly up until the end; however, I felt the story was resolved too quickly in the last 20 or so pages, when a new character was added which I didn't think was a good choice artistically. However, this is a highly suspenseful story."
4,Pure entertainment,"Hope Stevens disappeared from the witness protection program and from agent Roland Larson's life. The problem is that Larson fell in love with her and wants to find her again. When the list of protected witnesses disappears into the hands of the mob who want Hope dead, Larson must find her in order to save her life- and the life of a daughter he never knew he had.CUT AND RUN is a very fast paced novel that starts slow but gains increasing momentum. As the action picks up, the chapter length shortens thereby creating quick vignettes. This is the same technique James Patterson uses to keep his books lightening quick. There are many faults with the book including the stereotypic characters. The main purpose is pure entertainment and in this it readily succeeds."
2,Not commendable,The book is almost thrilling but not quite. Penny's story is really disappointing. Would yo believe what happened to her in the bathtub? Nor anything else while she was with her abductor. Not in a million years. The last 80 pages or so could be written in about 20. Maybe I had read overly books about spies and witness protection but I really didn't like how Hope escaped the program and nobody did nothing about it.
2,Not his best work,"I was disappointed with Cut and Run. It took me a LONG time to finish this book because every time I set it down I had little interest in picking it back up again. I didn't find the story line very compelling, and the characters were not fully formed. Not sure if I'll be reading another Pearson book...I guess it depends on the reader ratings here at Amazon."
3,Good Workout...but not with Baby,"I was so excited to get this, I was desperately feeling the need for some yoga, and with a young baby, was hoping for a routine I could do with him.Long story short, this is a good workout. It is much better than a lot of postnatal DVDs that I have come across. However, this is not a good workout to do with a baby. There are a few poses in which you interact with the baby. In the rest, you are instructed to leave him on the floor and tend to him if he gets fussy. Um....okay, so pretty much I'm not working out then.I will try this again when my baby is older, once he is able to entertain himself more, and be entertained by the animals on the screen. I am hoping that way, I'll actually get my money's worth out of it.Really, a good DVD, just not to do with a baby."
3,*shrugs*,"I want to like this one. It has all the things in it I usually like - unforced diversity, holidays, cats, intergenerational relationships, sweetness... but for some reason I just can never get into it. I don't understand why. I like other books by this author, but this one, not so much."
1,Cheesy,"If you like words such as ""special"" and ""share,"" this book will no doubt appeal to you.An old Jewish woman, an African-American child, a cat - it's all too contrived and cute for my tastes.Sorry to offend anyone who loved this book, but it just did not work for me."
4,Assisted Suicide...,"I've always liked Judd Nelson. Ever since THE BREAKFAST CLUB, I've looked for good Nelson movies. Alas, they seem to be few in number. RELENTLESS is one of his best. Buck Taylor (Nelson) is a sick and tormented soul. He's also a serial murderer w/ a desire to ""help"" his victims by brutally ending their lives. Taylor uses a unique method to carry out his vicious crimes, in that he allows his prey to join in on their own hideous deaths. Yep, Buck is dangerously deranged. He's motivated by his upbringing by his cold, unmerciful father. Leo Rossi (HALLOWEEN 2) and Robert Loggia (SCARFACE, INNOCENT BLOOD) play the cops who must catch Taylor and end his psychopathic spree. Meg Foster (and her dazzling blue eyes!) plays Rossi's wife. RELENTLESS is well worth owning..."
5,Great Overview of a Great Band,"The Allman Brothers are truly the ultimate in southern rock, maybe even rock in general, and this compilation, for the most part, really shows what they could do.With a good mix of short hits , such as Midnight Rider, and longer jams, such as Sweet Elizabeth Reed, there is something on these discs for just about anyone. I know all my favorites are included on this album. My only one regret is a shortened version of Jessica, but other than that, this compilation is all anyone needs in life.Whether you're a big fan or casual listener, I would strongly recommend getting this CD. Other compilations such as A Decade of Hits just don't have everything you need. Fans of the live stuff should also check out Fillmore East and those who like the hits should look into Eat A Peach."
5,fantastic,"a very clear and concise reboot introducing the joker, great art, good story. gives you an idea of where part of the premise of batman begins came from."
4,They are destines to do this for ever! Plus a little bonus.,Want to see when was the first time the Joker terrorized Gotham? Then look no further!The Man Who Laughs shows Batman's first encounter with the Prince Clown of Crime.Though the the main story is a very short read we do get a bonus story. (Alan Scott plus Batman plus Jim G.= awesome)A must have for any Batman fan.
3,"Good, but not the pay-off I expected.","This is the first thing I've ever read from Brubaker, so I don't have much to go on in terms of how different or new it is from his other stuff. What I can say, is that it's a much better written Joker story compared to a lot of the other ones out there. The book builds nice tension up until the last confrontation Batman and Joker have; which I felt was very lackluster and not even close to as memorable at The Killing Jokes end. The Joker taking over televison and what not is old at this point. However, the additional story of the Green Lantern I thought was great, that managed to invoke more emotion from me than the TMWL. What is top-notch here is the art. I recommend this to anyone who is a fan of the Joker as it is a short and fun read."
5,Toe to toe with The Killing Joke,"The Man Who Laughs is perhaps one the the best Joker tales out there. For me, it was an instant classic. Brubaker depicted the iconic Joker as a psyco, which he is. And sometimes in other Joker related books, he can come across campy or goofey and just down right stupid. Not here. In this book, he has an edge.TMWL fits into the Year One canon picking up after Batman and the Mad Monk. It's well written and the art by Doug Mahnke is awesome to say the least. It's not inked as dark as some others in the Year One line of books, but the colors make sense and it's not cartooney as some others.This book has a ton of re-reading value and it never gets old. For me, it's up there with The Killing Joke standing beside it actually. And that's not an easy feat to accomplish.If you don't have this book, buy it. If you're a Year One buff like me, it's a must have. If you like the Joker and Batman dynamic, buy it. You can't go wrong!"
2,Catchy Title but Overall Disappointing,"I was expecting a good insight into the topic of networking but was disappointed by the rather shallow treatment of this subject. The author tries to differentiate between the ""name droppping, business card-distributing"" schmoozer-type (that one comes across at parties, events, and conferences) and an effective networker, but in the end he fails to distinguish himself from those schmoozers.If you're looking for guerilla networking tactics you will find many (and you may already know most of those) in this book. If, however, you want some insight into effective techniques to connect (I prefer the word ""connecting"" to ""networking""), then pass this one."
2,Name Dropping and Self Importance,"If you can get past Ferrazzi's name dropping and self-importance, his tips are good. As a reserved, shy person, I found his ideas to be beneficial, but I found, unfortunately, his bragging and name-dropping detracted from the book. Those who can filter out the noise created by his arrogance will find his ideas helpful."
1,Skip this one,"I heard this guy at a conference, and of course our conference hosts presented us with the book as a gift in our rooms the night before. I walked out on the ""speech,"" and thought maybe the book would be better. Alas, it wasn't. This is the most self-aggrandizing book of this genre I have ever read. One wonders how many times that ""I"" appears in the book. ""I did this, I did that, I'm great...."" You name it. His methods smack of insincerity and merely using people for his own advantage. It disgusts me. Much better material out there; don't waste your money on this one. Unless you like to use people."
2,Very Used Product,I was surprised to see that the book I ordered had a number of pages that were highlighted. I have sold books and purchased second hand books but nothing that had highlights. I planned on reselling the book but now there is no real market for it unless Grassroots wants to buy it back.
2,"Sounds Good, Little Substance",I feel like this book is a big compilation of common sense. Just another self-help book telling you what you already know with a slight variation in wording. I regret buying it.
2,Boring. Better books on networking out there,"I found this book to be boring and too full of the authors ego. We could all have a rolodex of big-shots names if we started out in the in-crowd, had assistants to do research on the people who would be at conventions, and wrote a book. Most of the tactics listed in the book, would get us ostracized from every club we wanted to be in. They are impractical and rude at the least.The incessant name dropping and the "" I was a poor boy who made it big"" story, took up most of the pages. Save your money!"
2,Not impressed,This stuff put into practice would spread your network to thin and you wouldn't make real friends with anybody. I didn't gain anything from reading this book.
1,"Gloria J. in Santa Rosa, CA","Most of the text is devoted to tips about how to make yourself as visible as possible to someone more visible than yourself, which ultimately reads as blatently self-promoting and swarmy; a pitiably shallow alternative to the exploration of qualities like service, ingetrity, and energy. There is much more substantial business advice out there on leadership and confidence that truely is the backbone of American commerce and strength. Look into ""The Secrets of Effective Leadership, A Practical Guide To Success"" by F.A. Manske, Jr. or any of Dale Carnagie's classics for a solid meal."
4,The Hunter and the Hunted,"A very interesting book about the life and tragic life of Captain Kidd, the privateer who can't catch a break and winds up being branded a pirate himself and hanged. The book shows how tragic his attempt is to get exonerated and how the legal system ""loses"" the one piece of evidence that can set him free, and he has to resign himself to his fate and await his death. The book gets a bit dry at times, but tells the story that I was unaware of about the true Captain Kidd that is not in the fairy tale books...incidentally, much more interesting. Highly recommended."
