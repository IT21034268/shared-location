2,Nice watch but D.O.A.,"The watch was well recieved, but had a dead battery when I got it. Somewhat disappointed, still a good looking watch"
1,Terrible design,This is incredibly poorly designed - it is clear that the manufacturers never attempted to assemble this item.
4,this is a book more than about unrequited love; it teaches us how we can love people and ourselves.,"While there is ""He is jut not that into you"", giving indicators on whether he likes you or he doesn't, Smit's book, ""Loves Me, Loves Me Not,"" talks about unrequited love in a deeper and wider spectrum. It teaches you what unrequited love is and what we may do when we encounter it.When I reached the end of the book, I realized that this is a book more than about unrequited love; it teaches us how we can love people and ourselves."
2,No way,I was very disappointed in the taste of this product. I have had some great tasting Manhattan Chowder in restaurants. Hard to find in cans. Thought I would try this. I wish I could have bought just one can to try. I did not like it at all..
2,For serious collectors only.,I realize that the recordings of this legendary artist need to be preserved but the audio quality of the original tapes is so bad that some editing and remastering is definitely required. For serious collectors only.
3,A Spiritual Approach to Astrology,"As stated the cover was shabby but the book itself, which was hardbound was in perfect condition."
4,Darwin's Barnacles monograph,"I discussed this in my review of Darwin's Insectivorous Plants. I bought it for my Kindle, because it purported to include the illustrations, but they are not useful, because of the difficulty of skipping back and forth to find them, and the fact that they are small and blurred. But I learned a whole lot about Barnacles and about Darwin's methods. Definitely worth reading, even without the illustrations."
5,Pyrex 10-Piece Starter Storage Deluxe Set,"Nice! I can not stand plastic ware. I purchase these,and they are my left hand in the kitchen. From lunches to saving leftovers they are there for me."
2,Great until it shattered in my oven.,These were great until I was cooking a casserole and it shattered all over the entire oven. I have never had a negative thing to say about pyrex but how do you explain this? I have only had these for two months and one shatters in the oven. I hope everyone else has a better experience with this product than I have!
4,Great quality,"Much better than any plastic containers. Glass is the way to go. Does not stain or retain odors. Lids are also super tightUpdate 9/7/08After months of use, still going on strong!!! Lids have been through the dishwater several times and no warping. Watch for oily foods though b/c lids tend to absorb some of it and gets discolored."
4,"Great quality, but lacking size","I've been using these for a couple months now and have no real issues with item... stick em in the fridge to microsowave, diswasher safe, ... The only thing I will caution is that the containers are kind of small in size and the largest of the containers can only fit 2-3 servings at max. So if you're looking for something bigger, go fish."
5,Perfect Little Set,"I was looking for durable storage containers for leftovers, etc. and ran across these.I really love them! The different sizes are perfect for me (I usually only cook for one or two). I like the fact that the glass doesn't absorb any color or odor from stored food. And the lids fit great.I only hand wash my bowls and lids so I can't provide a review on their condition after using in the dishwasher.I would definitely buy this product again."
2,Pyrex drops the ball,"I purchased this exact same set 3 years ago and loved it. Recently I decided to do away with all my plastic containers and switch solely to glass so I purchased another set. The first set I got the lids wouldn't even go on the round containers. I called Pyrex to complain but they sent me to Amazon customer service instead. I found it odd that they didn't want to hear about their defective product. Anyway, Amazon replaced the set promptly and without hassle. The second set I got had almost the same problem! The lids are extremely hard to get on (only on the round containers) They are indented so far that they almost go inside the bowls instead of out. Maybe it was just one batch of the product but I would be leery of buying them again especially since Pyrex doesn't seem to stand behind their product. Thank goodness Amazon does."
1,Poor Quality,"Ordered this item as a supplement to some storage containers that were no longer available. Thinking Pyrex would be a fair quality product for the price, was I wrong! First of all it listed the item as a 10 piece set, only 5 Containers and 3 lids. I think that makes 8. Missing the two lids basically turns the container into a bowl. Also, the lids themselves are very flimsy and do not fit the containers well. Would not recommend."
1,Covers don't fit containers & one bowl missing,Do not recommend to buy this product! This is by far the worst experience I have had so far from Amazon.One 1-cup bowl is missing. The lids are very difficult to put on and one of the lids was broken after 1 day.Not worth the effort and time to return.
1,They arrived broken,They were 5 pieces and 2 of them arrived broken?????? What Happened????I really don't know.I didn't send them back because I don't live in USA.
4,Nice alternative to plastic storage,"I'm trying to eliminate my plastic storage, especially so I can microwave leftovers easily. These are great and have been working really well for my family."
4,Good deal for price,I liked the quality of Pirex anyway. This is really good deal for the price here...
5,This is my 2nd set,I love these...So much that I bought another set. The only bad thing I found about them is that the lids are a little hard to close. They are microwave able and easy to wash.
3,Quality but lacks quantity,Although accurate the stated 10 pieces is a bit deceiving since it includes the lids.
4,Great Product - Made in USA,"I replaced our old plastic storage containers with these glass ones. I love that they are glass and versatile. The rectangle pieces are a little on the small side, but still usable. Big plus is they are made in the USA."
4,Classic pyrex.,"Not much to say as it appears to be the same pyrex it has always been. Great seal and gets the job done. My only issue with the pyrex would be the lids. We just recently ordered the lids only from the distributor b/c, although they were several years old, the lids themselves did crack on the edges. That said, we still ordered more and like pyrex more than any other brand we have found."
5,Perfect,This is a great product for people who don't want to use plastic in the microwave. The lids fit the glass containers well even after tons of washing.
4,the are smaller then they look.,"They are great for food storage, but for some reason the picture made them look like the full size glass pieces. They are a bit smaller then that."
2,Meh.,When this set arrived I was disappointed because the glass containers were much smaller than I anticipated. It is my fault for relying on the Amazon photographs and not previewing the container sizes before buying. I will keep them because I already recycled the packaging but I would not recommend this set for storing food unless you are saving your leftovers for your pet mouse...
3,L.Newton Phila. PA,Pyrex of course you can't deny you will get quality. But I was surprised at how small the pieces are.
2,title - Product feature mismatch,"I liked the containers, everything came in time and the packaging was appropriate for such a fragile item. But keep in mind that there is a potential mismatch between the information given in the title of the product and the description in the Product Features part: in the title there is reference to 10-piece set but in the Product Feature there is reference to 5 storage containers. So indeed I got 5 containers. Perhaps the 10 Piece Set in the title is somehow not related to the quantity of the containers in the package but to something else. But again, this is not clear at first reading. Despite the fact that acknowledge my lack of attention to the information on the site, my impression is that the title could be more helpful."
2,The lids don't fit,"I have not had these long, have not used them for anything but freezing so far and after reading the reviews I won't be using them for anything but freezing and storage.But even then I found it was very difficult to get the lids on. Finally I ran a lid under hot water, then quickly dried it and was able to get the lid on the container but otherwise they would not fit.I wonder if these are even made in the US."
5,these are great for packing lunch to work,"they come in different sizes so you can pack whatever you like. I haven't had any problems with leakages, the lids are pretty tight. Just make sure you handwash the lids so they don't end up warping like typical plastic tupperware, though I've thrown mine into the dishwasher dozens of times and the lids are still fine.These are great not only for packing lunches, but also for steaming and baking small food proportions!The only ""problem"" I have with these is like any dish you nuke for a few minutes, it gets super hot and hard to grab on to. Just make sure when you get these out of the microwave to use some mitts (I use a few layers of paper towels, scrunch them up and grab onto the dish) before you drop the whole thing."
4,Love glass storage bowls but...,I really like glass storage bowls and I am happy with these bowls for the most part. My issue is that one of these bowls had a broken rim just from being stored on the shelf. It was never even used. I washed them and put them on the shelf for storage with the lids on them. One of them was broken when we tried to use it- too late for the return period. Love them otherwise.
5,Glass is always better than plastic,"Pyrex product is always the best, I have been using it for so many years and it still look great. I used to use plastic container and it will eventually have stain and smell that I have to replace it once or even twice a year, end up cost me a lot more money. One thing to be caution is glass container is glass and make sure you put some padding when you transport it, I broke one once.By the way, if you are buying the warehouse deal, which I bought it through the deal, be sure you know that it's opened box as most of them are return problem. Therefore, the package may not be original and don't have full protection when shipping. I ended up received a broken bowl in the whole set."
2,Jojo,"Im giving this product 3 stars, I thought the size was going to be bigger. But the quality is not that great. The glass is very thin.. Poorly made..."
2,Misleading,"This is advertised as a ""10 piece set"" but it is really only 5 items. The 5 lids are included in the ""10 items"", which I find misleading and disappointing."
2,I wish I had read the negative reviews,"These dishes are extremely small and are only made for carrying leftovers to work for lunch. The size was so disappointing when we opened it - we actually started laughing and immediately said ""white elephant gift"". Also, the lids are also hard plastic and difficult to get on. I have Pyrex bowls with softer plastic lids from about 6 years about - which I absolutely love - and apparently other people did too because some of them have disappeared over time. We bought these new ones to replace the ones that have vanished and because we wanted something to cook a dish in, cover, and take to dinner parties - these are way too small for that. I'm sure we'll end up using these new ones, but in different way then we intended. Overall, I would definitely hesitate to buy Pyrex again because of the lids."
3,inconsistent lids or glassware,"After reading the various reviews about lids that are too tight or loose and testing my own set for liquid leakage, my conclusion is that there must be quality control issues ensuring proper fit.FYI, I don't have any issues about getting the lids on or off. In addition to my own set, I bought another set for my mom as a gift, and she couldn't get the lids on to the smaller bowls (2 & 3 1/2 cups). In my set, the 6-cup rectangular has a loose fitting lid and leaks like a sieve (otherwise, the other bowls are water-tight).While these are cheaper than theGlasslock, the Glasslock lids has a snapping mechanism that's easier to use. They also have a silicone gasket in the lid that ensure air-tightness and prevent leakage. If price is not an issue, I recommend those instead."
4,Pyrex bowls,These bowls are great for the price. Bought 2 sets for $20 w/ free shipping. Multi-purpose and the lids are a bonus. Would recommend.
2,"Not the old Pyrex, not made of high quality borosilicate glass","Pyrex is no longer made of borosilicate glass, which is safe for freezer to oven use. it is now made in asia of lime silicate glass. Not as durable. Many consumer problems with it. Buy borosilicate bakeware. I'm sure this stuff is fine for storage, but not for the microwave or oven. It can fail unexpectedly due to micro-cracks, causing ruined dinner, messes, and even burns and cuts. Beware inferior products. Search for borosilcate bakeware, it is what lab equipment is still made of, just like pyrex used to be."
5,Lids not a problem,"Read some reviews about how the lids ""warp"" with time or don't fit tightly with time... well, I've never had this problem (???)But I should mention that I NEVER heat the lids with containers in the microwave. Ever. If I need to cover the container to prevent splattering, I use a glass dish or something of that nature. I just hate heating plastic around food (possible chemicals leaching into the food and all)... even if the stuff is supposedly microwave-safe.It's the whole reason I bought these glass containers in the first place, after all. So no warping issues thus far."
5,Great value!,Our prior set lasted 15 years before the tops began to crack; hope for 15 more with this set! Super price and fast shipping.
4,pyrex storage bowls,"Love these bowls. The only problem is the lids. If you have any arthritis in your hands or fingers, they can be a bit of a challenge to handle. This is the only reason I didn't give a rating of 5 stars."
5,good ones,"the lids for the bowls are a little tight, but it does not matter. After using several times, they works well."
3,Cheap lids are difficult to attach and gets too hot to touch when cooking in microwave,"I wanted these as an alternative to microwaving in plastic containers (which is reported as being unsafe). Be aware that glass (of course) gets very hot in the microwave. There is no cool place to grab the container, so it becomes a bit of a chore wrestling it out. If you had a similar intent, then keep that in mind. I know pyrex sells an alternative with a handle, which you might want to consider, despite the price and storage size increase.Also the lids are very cheap and immediately get warped. They are still usable, but a constant pain.Decent product."
4,Worth the price,"I did A LOT of searching for a chair or couch for my daughter (16 months) & ended up with this one. We've only had it for two months or so but it's been such a big hit with her. I definitely think it's worth it for the money. I mean, look at PBK's Anywhere Chair...same concept (all foam) but more than 3 times the price. We've had no major accidents so far, so ours still looks great. The foam is sturdy enough, as far as foam goes but it's not something that will last forever. Still, even if it gets thrashed, for $30 I'm not going to sweat it. It was a great ""investment"" for us."
5,One of the finest CDs I own,"I am a professional musician (trumpeter) and music professor, and listen to all kinds of wonderful music. This is my favorite CD in my personal collection. Some of the finest instrumental work I've heard. I just heard Phil in concert recently, and he is a true artist. This is his finest album, in my opinion."
3,fire pit,"Overall well made. The reason I gave it a 3 star was that it cut me by sharp barbs sticking out on the inside of the grill.They couldn't be seen until you got cut. Poor quality control, by not checking the ember screen before shipping. These barbs are sticking out all around the inside of the fire pit. I used a hammer and flattened all the barbs.Other wise this would be a 5 star.."
1,won't buy again,i got them and they were all scratched up. cant really see out of them. and they were all bent.
2,Super Dark,Flimsy.Super Dark... too Dark to wear drivingWay to small for my head. (My head is huge though)The Mirror Lens are nice though.
4,Excellent Choice,"I needed a large number of mirrored aviator sunglasses for a school play. This product gave me just what I wanted on time and at a price that was reasonable for a school play. Even if these are not going to be used on a stage, they are a great bargain."
2,"Not a true ""aviator"" shape.",These are more round than aviator-style. I was really disappointed and ended up giving them to my brother and his friends.
1,Defected,"I bought 2 sets of this sunglasses and this set ALWAYS has crack/broken (on the inside part) which I already know and anticipate. There's something that brought my attention this time, the lens ARE NOT THE SAME of each pair. It's supposed to be the same type of mirror lens, but this one starts from somewhat black, a bit mirrored to intermediate mirrored lens. I'm really disappointed this time, you can actually see through it. What's the point of mirror lens if it only reflects a bit of the light? Last set that I bought has crack on each of the pairs but I don't really care since it's on the inside and the mirror lens reflect the lights and you couldn't see the crack. These set that I bought... It's just horrible! You could see everything behind the mirror lens. I don't know how else should I describe my disappointment this time."
3,What do you expect for a cheap price?,Killer value.However as expected the quality of these are certainly questionable. Two of them were completely bent up. But nothing a little elbow grease didn't fix.super dark! Like a 70% transparency.mine came with 3 drawstring pouches. two of them were light purple and one was baby blue silk-like material. Not my style so I certainly won't be using them. But I'm sure I can give them away..
3,All 3 pair cam with broken lenses,"I received all 3 pairs of sunglasses with cracked lenses. Two were very bad and while the 3rd had a smaller crack, it was still very noticeable and would no doubt worsen over time.Visually, they look pretty good for aviators, though as others have noted, they are not built extremely well which would explain the cracked lenses and I suppose is to be expected at this price range.The only two additional comments I would add is that the frames are not particularly big. Some aviators have huge lenses and these are on the smaller side. Also, the glasses are not very deep, meaning the side frame pieces are relatively short so people that require larger, deeper frames should probably steer clear."
2,uncomfortable sunglasses,"These sunglasses were pretty small and uncomfortable, plus the lengths of the sides are different. One side was really long."
4,I like them,"This product is great if you are expecting what you get. The frames are good as are the lenses. For me, they fit my face perfectly. Remember, though, you are not forking over $[...]. These are good all around sunglasses with a distinctive look. I like 'em."
4,Flashback,"Had to order these glasses. I was having an 80's flashback. Great item, incredible price. Delivered quickly in perfect shape."
1,boorishly bureaucratic and mud-slinging,"Spasmodically researched, abominably written, and distastefully biased, Tyler's ""Great Wall"" is a slog of a read. Its deeply cynical portrayal of every public figure, its boorish recounting of each private squabble, together with its complete lack of historical proportionality, all make it well worth missing. Profoundly disappointing.--Of Special Note: Kissinger fans, beware!---Tyler's malignant portrayal of Kissinger easily rises to the level of vendetta, dominating the largest portion of the book. The statesman ""weasles"" and snakes his way across the pages, ending finally as the author's own epithet. Offensive."
1,BLESS ME BLESS ME!,Not only is this book bad with history (as mentioned below numerous times) but I think any Wiccan/Pagan who stands there constantly asking these deities for blessings in such a childish manner they are bound to get a big deity hand smack across the face!
2,Ummmm....well....,"This book was good for two things: 1)It was the first book I read when I started my exploration of magick , 2)The charts are alright but not the best. I began reading THE PORTAL BOOK by Ian Corrigan while I was still reading this one, and there is no comparison between the two. This book lacks a certain something...accurate info!"
1,Just for fun.,My only comment is this: Compare this book word for word with Norse Magic. That will say all I have to say
3,If you are new....,"This was one of the first books I picked up when I became interested in Wicca/Celtic/Pagan related interests... at the time, I thought it was a great book (and it was, for getting started) but it does have some misinformation in it and maybe it's not the best book in the world, but it definately served its purpose in getting me involved and wanting to know more. I actually enjoyed reading this book very much and although it may not be entirely accurate, it is one of my favorite in my collection. I recommend it to people wanting to get interested in the Craft, but do advise that they do not take everything in the text for true and the only way. There are many different ""ways"" and many different perspectives and it is up to you to formulate your own opinions about the right way... do some research and don't make this your only purchase."
2,"pretty for a little while,","The ring is charming and pretty, but the plating wears off fast. This is, apparently, not a ring to be worn every day, I have a gold heart with two nickel leaves and a barely visible cz. It was a gift, so I still treasure it, but I'd rather save for a better one next time. For the price, its about what I expected. However, its disappointing when the plating wears off."
2,Lola should have stayed unrevealed!,"I love Rachel Gibson's books but this one was a bust! A lingerie model who has posed all but naked for catalogs who is devasted because her ex put nude photos of her on the Internet??Lola was shallow (tweezing her eyebrows on a deserted island) and not too bright! She's stranded in the Bermuda Triangle, with a stranger, in a disabled boat, drug runners hunting them and she's freaked because Max used her TOOTHBRUSH!! Uh, duh, not real high on the priority list!I also had to agree with what another reviewer said about the editing! So many mistakes!! I read four or five books a week and many of them are the same way! Does anyone edit these??"
1,Do not buy!,The metal clip broke the first day since it is not strong enough for the weight of the bassoon. I should have listened to the other review. Don't waste your money.
1,Save your money.,"I was really excited with this purchase, but the seat strap didn't even last through one full rehearsal. Broke within the first hour! The metal clasp is just too weak to support the full weight of the bassoon."
1,A bad beginning,"This novel is not a good beginning for the new ""Bombshell"" series. The romantic lead lacks charisma and is really quite bland. He's also married with children. Actually, the most interesting man in the novel is the heroine's partner. There is very little romance, and the rest of the novel moves ponderously. Finally, the end is disappointing. I read romances to reach a happy ending to the romance. You'll understand if you can actually finish this novel."
2,it's great but you need to buy new one soon,"love it and once you used the stone you never want to use other one when you bake a pizza. However it doesn't last long. I bake a pizza at least once per month maybe twice per month. after using the stone for 3-4month it will break...I had to buy three time. No matter how careful, it doesn't work. If you want to bake a perfect pizza, buy this! but if you don't want to spend $20 for buy new one every 5-6 month, don't buy this"
2,just another review,"For all people who want to inform themselves about socialism and communism in very abstract way. Personally I prefer to treat an issue in a realistic way, and I think the oppinions and feelings of the situations that Orwell describes would better be understood if he had used human characters.FINE"
2,Easily Breakable,These cases are decent.They are not very durable though.They tend to break at the hinge when opening.
5,Thoroughly good read,"I loved the old edition of this book back in the nineties and was really excited to find out that it was being updated. It's now got all his new films and shows his transformation from Hollywood bad boy to family man.It's a really great book - it gives a thorough portrayal of his whole career in films as well as showing us his private life behind the screen. It's also a great read and made me itching to watch some of those old films like 'Ed Wood', as well as eager to see the forthcoming 'Finding Neverland'. The black and white film stills and pictures really complete this tribute to one of the finest actors of our time."
2,Damaged goods,"There is nothing wrong with the cases that survived, but 10 of the 25 cases were damaged to the point of being useless. The damage was evident by looking at the side of he actual plastic film the cases are packaged in. I can't say for sure, but I think the item was damaged before it was put into a box for shipment. The cases are exactly as they should be, but the unit packaging could use some work."
5,don't know what the problem is - works perfect,"I just got an ASD-1R and connected it to a Denon AVR-2807. No sweat at all, works perfect. I almost did not buy it because of all the neagtive reviews. I figure some folks have trouble because they either don't have the proper receiver or the (demanding) Denon instructions for their amps/receivers threw them off. The AVR-2807 is equipped with a control dock for the ASD-1R, making it real easy. Iit works just great and I am very glad that I got this gizmo.Goodbye CD player."
2,Low fidelity,Denon offers no digital connection so I'm not able to hear my CD quality Lossless music data in it's actual fidelity.
4,Denon ASD,"My I-Pod works great with it. Didn't use the adapters, just left my cover on and plug it in and jam."
4,A great First barbie doll!,"We received this as a birthday gift & my daughter loved it. Its bigger than a traditional ""barbie"" and with a soft body. All the clothes fasten w/ velcro (+ great for little hands, - because it snags her fabric body) and the shoes are oversized. (No more sucking those babies up in the vacuum or losing them around the house!) We found several other extra outfits at varying locations and in clearance bins. Posable arms and legs, and a very pretty doll!"
4,Hex Shank Drill Bit Assortment,"They work very well on soft woods. Broke one using on hard wood, with what I thought was little pressure. Other than that they do the job.Makita 784000-A-A UltraLok 5 Piece 1/16-Inch to 3/16-Inch Hex Shank Drill Bit Assortment"
5,Luminous images from a photographer with the travel bug.,"Photographer Henry Hamlin is plagued with the travel bug and blessed with the perfect eye. He's been everywhere: East Africa, India, the former Soviet Union, Vietnam, Turkey, Tibet, the American West. His luminous portraits--of Russian school children, Masai warriors, Khampa horsemen, Hanoi vendors, American Indian dancers, and more--are especially wonderful. The images capture people at their best. The dress and surroundings of his subjects are unique, exotic, yet their faces are familiar. In the end, these two fine volumes of color photographs are a celebration of the human family to which we all belong."
1,Freshman Study,"The author of this book gives us little more than a synopsis of the plots of the Marjorie Allingham books featuring Albert Campion. There are few, if any, insights into the development of the character. To anyone who has read most or all of the Campion canon I would say, don't waste your money. To those who are interested in Allingham and Campion I would say, read the originals. In summation: a waste of the reader's time and money."
3,dosen't do any one thing well.,"got one for chrismas and here are my peeves.Can't resume song on startup. My Archos Jukebox has an alternative os and resume a song from the middle, just like my car cd player.Dosen't follow playlists. You can't upload playlists for mp3's. I have contacted MSI and they say they will not impliment this or other features.I have also experienced audio synch problems when playing back divx encoded files.there is no timer on the analog record, you have to be around to manualy turn off the recording.I have used it on the train and on airplanes and the battery life is very good.I would not recommend this as I don't think it is ready for prime time."
2,VERY DISAPPOINTED,"I would love if someone from this company could contact me about why i only got a half bag of white sand. The color was just right that i wanted if only it had been the right amount. I purchased two bags, 1 mauve and 1 white...the mauve sand was intact and made it obvious to see just how much sand had leaked out of the white bag of sand. Aftering turning the white bag of sand different ways i realised where the puncture was. So i got 1 and 1/2 bags of sand. Very disappointed."
4,Faithful adaptation.,"I like to show this to my class after covering the Chekhov short story. It's a rather faithful adaptation for the most part, although about more dramatic than the dry, realist depiction offered in the story. Enjoyable, though, nonetheless."
1,did not fit,Although it said it would fit my Honda ATC 200ES it did not. Too long and also opening slightly too large. Very disappointed in this K&N product.
4,"Org Theory,Design, and Change (6th Edition)",The book ins very informative. It also is written in a style and at a level where it can be easly understood.
3,Book was ok,This book had pages stuck together but it was usuable. It got the job done.Thanks for the quick delivery and helping further my education.
1,Diana Exhausted....is more like it.,"This is one of, if not the worse remix album I have ever heard. The tracks are lame and what's so bad is that the disc was remixed by well known Dj's like David Morales and Steve Silk Hurley..I have heard much much better from them. The best remix on this cd would have to be ""Love Hangover"" but even that gets boring after the first 4 minutes. You'd be better off spinning a old Dinan Ross record backwards for a good remix. Avoid this one by all means."
2,Promising concept fizzles out,"It's difficult to be captured by stories that seem to have been rushed. The whole Sexcapades thing was a promising concept, but the stories fail to deliver the amount of romance and eroticism that said concept required. All three novellas lack story development. The characters jump into the sack before the reader gets to know them. There's no building of sexual or romantic tension. Janelle Denison is one of my favorite erotic romance writers, but His Every Fantasy is an enormous disappointment. I couldn't finish Carly Phillips's Going All the Way. The aforementioned novella had more cliches than the average romance novel. Vicki Lewis Thompson's Illicit Dreams is passable, albeit insubstantial. All in all, Invitations to Seduction is a feeble effort. I'll stick to Kensington Brava anthologies from now on."
5,Beyond The Usual and Into the Application,"One of the most exceptionally valuable aspects of this book is its clear, concise, simple to follow guidelines for how to move beyond TALKING about how SOMEDAY you will live your joy..... it goes into LIVING your joy right here right now by following this step and that step and the other step... clearly, concisely AND ALSO with signature Suzanne Falter-Barnes style.Its kind of like getting down to the brass tacks of the situation... actually getting the fingers-- the palms -- the fists into the fingerpaints and just going for it in whatever way you can right here right now and then getting up tomorrow and doing the same thing so that in two weeks, two months, two years from now you will be LIVING your joy... rather than two weeks, two months, two years you would have been still TALKING about someday....."
2,Review of Sphere,The Sphere Floating HabitatGreat fun. We used in our pool. Used maybe seven or eight times before it ripped. Wasn't particularly rough use. We had read other reviews that is delicate so we were being careful. Our little boy who is same size as kid in picture was standing in same way and one whole panel suddenly deflated. Is a good product but couldn't justify buying a replacement as wouldn't have any expectation it will last.
2,"Interesting, but impractical.","Buy this book if you are a jaded knitter and need the inspiration to take your craft to strange places where few knitters have gone before. Think Jan Messant - she of the atfully knitted vegetables (interesting, but who needs them) - only ten times so.For the rest of us, this one is interesting but impractical. You would never make any of the designs but it's still interesting to look and ponder at them. Think of it as a book on knitting theory, or a book of upscale gourmet recipes with beautiful pictures, rather than the recipe book that you love and use everyday."
5,The Secret to Baking,"This is an awesome set. I bake often, and I look forward to using this set when it arrives. It has almost eveything I use when baking, and I don't have to go the store to buy each piece separately (and probably spend more money in the process). I highly recommend this to anyone who bakes."
2,Knights and dragons.....,I bought these in person at micheals for cheaper but that is not why I only gave them 2 stars. The horses and some of the men have extra warped plastic from when they were molded. So they will not stand up. If they stood up on their own I would give this set a favorable review.
3,a good choice,"although this clipboard is a little flimsy I can keep myimportant info on the inside of it and that helps a lot. other than that it's very ""clip-boardy"" and thats just what the doctor ordered"
2,A silly tale about an Iguana's search for something better.,"Although the illustrations are very nicely done, very amusing, the story itself could use some help.A pet iguana's health suffers as she lacks something in her life - outdoors, sunshine...adventure, perhaps. I found it a bit sad that the iguana was able to leave her friend/owner so easily to go off on an adventure on her own.The direction this story should have gone was for the owner to figure out that the iguana needed a change of scenery. Then the story could have shown how the owner of the iguana went about getting her pet to a happier place, if even just for a vacation."
4,Great to take to pot lucks!,"I like being able to pack either a cold or hot dish to a pot luck dinner, having it arrive close to the temperature in which it's meant to be. My Pyrex 5-piece Portable allows me to conveniently do just that. The lid is easy to attach to the glass dish; removal is just as simple. It is attractive and large enough to help feed a good-sized group."
3,"Good book, but now out of date","Much has changed since 1990, particularly in patent law, with the advent of the provisional patent application. Still useful, but many details will be incorrect."
5,The third edition is up to date--It is super!!!,"I don't know whether or why the 2d edition would be on sale, as the first reviewer implies in his or her nevertheless good review. The third edition has been out for two years and it is complete, accessible, understandable, and better than the competition--by far! If you want to understand patents, copyrights, trademarks, this book will make you an expert in an afternoon."
3,"A little superficial, but okay.","Like almost all hornbooks or outlines, this one glosses over Trademark law. Copyright, Patents, and Trademarks are all taught seperately, so I don't understand why they are lumped together and glossed over superficially by almost all hornbooks."
4,Great Game!,"This is a really cool game for any thomas fan! My three year old loves it!It is pretty hard to get him to turn corners in one of the games, like the other lady mentioned.You have to keep backing up & trying again, can be frustrating to even adults....."
1,Low price doesn't make up for poor quality,I was looking for an inexpensive way to store homemade cd's so I chose this item. I would estimate that at least 40% of the cases arrived damaged or broken and they are so cheaply constructed that on the ones that weren't broken the plastic tabs break on the first or second use. Spend a little more and get something of higher quality.
1,One-fifth of order damaged,10 of the 50 cases were damaged - more to do with quality of product than the shipping I suspect. Poor quality.
1,Disappointing review material.,I also bought this book as part of my review materials for the PE exam thinking that it would be a comprehensive summary of the equations used in each chapter. It is not. Maybe 20% of the material is provided. I didn't even bring it with me to the exam. You're better off making your own review sheets and spending your money on tabs for the Reference Manual (which is VERY good).
3,OK but Should Be Half the Price!,"Be warned that this refillable bottle is surprisingly cheaply designed and made. The biggest downside is the lid has nothing but a little friction to hold it on. There are no threads! Had I known it was this cheaply made I would do what I am going to do, not use it but just use a piece of sponge (cut from a sponge) dampened with water in a cut off soda bottle (a bowl could spill easily. With the cut plastic soda bottle I have tall sides & keep water level low. I fear using this bottle could prove a disaster where the top pops off and water dumps everywhere. I wonder if Sparko paid the Chinese more than 5 cents to make this thing!"
5,Great Service,The Bible was in Great condition! It arrived in only just a few days. I would use them again!
5,Works Great for Me,Holding an 80 lbs. heavy bag in my basement after my old chain was lost in the move. Works great with my Everlast heavy bag stand.
3,ehhh,"i thought as a whole this book was pretty good, but it also seemed to portray a bad image at some points. happiness comes from the inside not the outside. and whne this girl stops eating, it makes it seem like thigns get better for her....NOT HEALTHY! i think the author could have not made it seem like starving yourself will make your parents and everyone love you...but thats just my opinion!"
3,Awesome,"This book is about a teenager. She is obese and she is like any other average teenager, but her brother was accused of date rape!"
3,earth butt other round things,nice read for young girls trying to fit into a world of unperfect .you will find a little part of yourself in this book.
5,run and buy,one day this book with cd will be more famous than it is alreadybuy this today - you be on the floor laughingits pure genius
4,It works...nothing more to it.,This cable is a unique USB cable for a Nikon digital camera. The only problem is I couldn't find the darn thing anywhere. It is a functional piece of equipment for certain but nothing super special.
1,Dont Buy,The Cable does not work with Nikon. Spend the extra money to buy this cable from a reputable company.
5,Same cord that camera came with,"This is the same kind of cord that came with my Nikon digital camera, just as I ordered, works great, no problems."
5,Discontinued! how are you supposed to connect to it now?,When I saw the Nikon discontinued this cable I was like what are you supposed to do to use Nikon Camera Control software? I guess it isn't my problem since I got them for 1 cent each when I remember paying $20 each a little under a year ago.
1,S4000 cable failure,Didn't work for me as a charging cable for an S4000 camera. Camera gave signal that either cable or charger was bad. I couldn't recommend it for this camera.
1,Fits & Charges but Won't Link,"I purchased this as 2nd cable to keep at my office. Computer links fine with OEM cable, but won't work with this non-OEM cable. Seems to charge OK though."
1,Couldn't stand it,"I have to say, I read only one story. But that was enough. It must have been the 8th story, since a child died in this one as someone else mentioned. This book reminded me of Pulp Fiction-type movies. I actually found Pulp Fiction hilarious, but it is not what I want my 8 year old son immersed in. The cynicism and violence, to me, is just not what children's literature is supposed to be about. They get enough of that in the real world & on TV. There's no innocence here! For this reason, I thought perhaps the book might be appropriate for a teenager who needs easier reading, but not for younger children."
5,UN ALBUM PARA LA POSTERIDAD !!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!,"Realmente PEARL JAM , debuto con TEN y hasta el momento para muchos ha sido el mejor trabajo de la banda y con el cual comparan todos los demas CDS lanzados posteriormente , y eso pasara siempre , sera esta la tendencia de comparar cualquier trabajo posterior con TEN.............es un gran album con un sonido muy profundo lleno de canciones muy profundas y epicas ,canciones que quedaran por siempre para cualquier fan de PEARL JAM , ami particualarmente me fascina Oceans y creo que es una de las mejores canciones compuestas por PEARLJAM , ademas esta RELEASE ,ALIVE, BLACK, PORCH y EVENFLOW en fin es un excelente album y esta desigando para estar como un album clasico de una de las mejores bandas de todos los tiempos .... un album inspirador para nuevas bandas y definitivamente que esta dentro de los mejores en el rock.una obra maestra del GRUNGE."
2,"What's up with ""Alive"" on the remastered disc???","IF you go 27 seconds into ""Alive"" on the remastered disc, the audio clearly drops down to a dull a slighty muted/muffled sound, then for the next minute goes back to sounding ok again. How did they miss that?It's great to have the dvd of the Unplugged performance but after listening to both discs, I don't hear any difference (other than loudness) in the remastered version over the original release.The remixed versions are interesting at first to listen to, but they certainly are not any better. In some songs, it's much worse. Yes it's good to hear Vedder more clearly but in so many songs the guitar solos are pulled back and get drowned out by other instrumentation. Other times Vedder sounds so separate from the music that it's almost like he's singing in a closet."
4,"Good, grunge or not grunge.","First of all, I'd like to say that I don't consider Pearl Jam grunge. They're just from Seattle and they came out in the early 90's and had a heavy alternative sound. I don't see any relationship between Nirvana and Pearl Jam. Anyway, this is a great album. ""Jeremy"" is a song that has a very important story behind it that always makes me cry. In fact, most of Eddie Vedder's songs have stories behind them and the way he sings them and the lyrics that are written for them are great. A lot of people don't like Eddie Vedder's voice, but I don't care. This is a great album. Give it a listen if you're getting into alternative music..."
5,Amazing CD,"As you probably can tell by the rating, this is an amazing CD. My opinion is that it's Pearl Jam's finest, if you don't like that style of music, fine, I won't review a gansta rap album or salsa album, because that's not my style.This CD hosts probably the 2 most popular songs by the band (Alive and Black, songs that you can't hear Eddie sing while live cause everyone sings along)If you like Pearl Jam, or early 90s rock, then this is the number one album to buy,"
3,Gossard's other bands were better,"Not to say this album isn't good, but if you look at where the musicians are comming from you might see what I mean. Gossard was in a band called Green River with a couple of these other dudes and Steve Turner and Mark Arm of Mudhoney and that was an amazing band. Then of course there was Mother Love Bone which was basically this band with Andy Wood singing and even though they were more in the vain of glam metal, they still had better songs than the songs on this album. In my opinion Vs. is a better album with songs like WMA that are hard to stop listening to, but really, I'd recomend getting Rehad Doll/Dry as a Bone by Green River or MotherLove Bone's self titled compilation and seeing if those two aren't just a bit better than this."
2,"bad back then, worse now","I remember well when this one came out. MTV ""fanboys"" immediately switched from hard rock to the grunge bandwagon hailing pearljam and the other grunge raggers as the new thing. The fact is, if you listened to ten or watched the videos you'd be asking yourself ""what am I missing here?"" - the musicianship is atrocious, the songs plodding, the singer's voice is monotonous yet this band behaved like they were the Doors..give us a break pleaseLuckily real rock music is now back and this kind of poserrock is now forgotten..same for soundgarden mudhoney stonetemple whatever...what a waste of air.....all those years.."
3,Don't Compare Nirvana to Pearl Jam,"Ok, I'll admit this right now, I loved Nirvana and thought Pearl Jam was a little to much corporate.You can't compare these two bands just because they're both from Seattle. Listen up, Nirvana was much more punkish and raw, and to be honest, more original, but thats not the point.These are two different bands with two different motives and different meanings and insperations in their songs. Got it?"
5,Defines Generation X,"Pearl Jam's best album and the best of of the Big 4's signature albums (Nevermind, Ten, Dirt, Superunkown). Nirvana defined grunge with their look, and Soundgarden and Alice in Chains were heavy metal bands, but this album is the epitome of the grunge scene and a prize of Generation Xers everywhere like myself.With the release of Lost Dogs and a computer, one can alter the disc running order a bit to include the good songs that did not make it on the album but were recorded at the same time. Doing this gives the listener a sense of how creative and talented these guys were. The new playlist:OnceEven FlowAliveWhy GoBlackJeremyOceansWashDirty FrankPorchAloneGardenDeepFootstepsYellow LedbetterReleaseTry to tell me this is not the best band of the 90s."
5,Pearl Jam rocks,"Although this CD does not contain Pearl Jam's best songs, it certainly has the most popular songs on in, like Alive, Black and Even Flow.I do thinks these are great songs, but this CD has more value than just these songs. Songs like ""Once"" and ""Porch"" (check this one out live) are just fabulous. It shows that PJ really has talent.If you like the harder songs on this CD, check out ""Vitalogy"" and ""No Code"", and ""Dirt"", a CD by Alice in chains. Pearl Jam live CDs are really great to. Take a look at the Fila Forum, Milan, Italy album, it shows the power of PJ live best."
5,Great Remix by Brendan O'Brien!,"I love what Brendan O'Brien did with the original tracks. Don't worry, the same vibe is there, just less unnecessary reverb. He pushes Ed's voice to the forefront and cranks up McCready's lead guitars! Fantastic! The only thing that might be a little polarizing is Brendan's remix of ""Jeremy"" which loses the ""Do Do DoDo DoDoDoo"" in favor of more volume on the guitar. I love it, but I can see where some might miss it. Can't wait for the new album!"
5,Excellent CD,"This CD is amazing. You don't have to like alternative to listen to Pearl Jam, you just have to like good music. The emotion on Black is amazing and the messages on the other songs are great. Edd Vedder is a master. He didn't just jump on the bandwagon of grundge--he helped create it. I think Kurt was as great as the next guy, but without PJ grunge is nothing. This album rocks, so buy it."
5,THIS ALBUM WILL ABSOLUTELY BLOW YOUR MIND!!!!!,"Never before have I heard an album this great! this is better than anything before it, better than the Beatles, anything! Pearl Jam is incredible! I mean wow! and theyve only gotten better! Led Zeppelin was my favorite band before, but Pearl Jam replaced them in my mind and rightfully so"
1,The Greatest pearl jam Album? The others must be pretty CRAP,I bought this album a while ago and it's crap. WHY DO pearl crap ALWAYS TRY TO COPY NIRVANA? I don't get it
1,straight outta jurassic park,"Just as bombastic and vacuous as Pink Floyd and Led Zeppelin, but Pearl Jam's not a dinosaur band, is it?"
1,This doesn't even deserve 1 star!,"My god, where to begin? Once is such a dumb song. That's all I need to say about that. Even Flow sounds like some idiot in his bedroom trying to be Hendrix with Mr. Garbage Mouth himself (that's right Eddie Cheddar!) throwing on his ""timeless"" mouthings about sucking (...)for crack in San Diego. Then you have Alive. Normally I'd like a song about a guy banging his mom, but sorry Eduardo! Not happening! Dumb, dumb, dumb. Why Go is another stupid song. Seriously. Then you have Black. My lord, what a crappy song. Could they try any harder to be INXS? I think not. Jeremy killed himself in class today! Awesome! Too bad he didn't kill Eduardo Veduardo instead! Now don't forget the other five songs. One, two, three, four, five against THEY ALL SUCK! BAD, BAD, BAD! THIS IS SUCH A CRAPPY ALBUM! IT MAKES NEVERMIND SEEM GOOD! DON'T BUY IT!"
4,Worth it for the extra tracks,"The extra tracks on this version - with Barrett just accompanied by his guitar - show how the original was almost completely ruined by a completely awful production; horrible, weeny organ, weedy drum playing, pointless noodling guitar. In contrast, the sparse, haunting versions of 'Rats' and 'Dominoes' in the extra tracks section show how it should have been done in the first place; just Barrett alone, voice and guitar. Its a pity that the original producers (I think it was David Gilmour) didn't have the fore-sight to at least try this approach. To me, Barrett's songwriting contains elusive moments of brilliance, and is somewhat reminiscent of another great English singer/songwriter Nick Drake."
2,Its mediocre to his only Pink Floyd album.,"The first Pink Floyd album which was almost completely written by Syd is his best stuff, way better than this solo album. Although it is entertaining to listen too, all the songs sound the same with the exceptions of a few titles. Only recomended to the die hard Syd Barrett fans. But Pink Floyds first album, Piper at the Gates of Dawn is spectacular."
3,"If you dig 'Piper', you'd like this...","The song stylings of Syd Barrett were one of a kind, playful, whimsical--setting the stage for the non-sequiter success of the like of Marc Bolan--Syd, was also however, an extremely tripped-out individual, and this remains his solo swan-song--guest Floyds Rick Wright and David Gilmore appear producing and playing (the latter some particularly madcap guitar on 'Baby Lemonade'), no doubt out of pity for ousting Syd out of his own group. Musically this one is superior to 'Madcap',..but Syd's mental faculties were fast deteriorating. It shows a snapshot of an artist and true originator in his last coherent period."
5,Awesome album! But...,"FINALLY! The last piece of the Warren Haynes/Allen Woody ABB line up puzzle! And boy was it worth the wait! I can't explain why they chose this one out of the three to take out of production. It's by far the best.One word of caution however. If you consider yourself a collector, then be careful with your purchase. The album I received was not the original '91 release, but an '08, digitally remastered, European release with adds and a band Bio where there should be proper liner notes.Still worth it by any stretch, but I (and I'm sure many of you) would have preferred to know what I was buying going in."
5,"Mesmerizing, Mystical, Modern","Contemporary and traditional, electronic and acoustic, religious and artistic: this album of classical Iranian melodies, Sufi poetry, and recording wizardry is sung and arranged by Sussan Dyhim supported by musicians playing the Persian instruments of setar, zarb, daf, zarb, kamancheh, ney, tar plus cello, bass, Indian tabla, and violin. Overdubbing and self-harmonization of voice particularly produces an otherwordly, spiritual feeling without being New Age, though on the cusp. I like it! The music is deeper and more meditative than the similar modern group Niyaz. Sometimes the ensemble produces an airy gossamer, other times it is a strong rhythmic dance, like Sufi breathy repetitions and body movements. The album is moody and mesmerizing."
3,I'll Show You how to Robot,"For the most part the Dvd is pretty good. The parts that actually show Tyson--the instructor--are very helpful. There is no doubt he knows what he is talking about and he is a very great dancer. However, lots of the movie is advertising his friends or believe it or not the movie, The Secret. Which is about quantum physics. I would rate this dvd with 5 stars in a second if it didn't get off subject or advertise other crap. He even shows your around his appartment and the dirty sponge he uses to clean dishes with. Worth seeing the dance parts. You can find them on Youtube."
2,"Dont buy, not worth even $20.","We got this at wal-mart as well, and it looked like a good deal. Problem is we have pets and this vacuum is not up to the task. With all the pet hair we have, I have to vacuum the same spot about 5 times just to get most of the hair. And the mini rotating brush attachment stopped spinning after about 1 months use, even after constantly taking it apart and cleaning it. And like another reviewer said, I have to put it on the bare floor setting for it to even pick anything up. One last complaint is the hose attachment, it plugs into the side and to activate the hose suction it just needs to be pulled out. Problem is it is always falling out or will get bumped against something and fall out, causing vacuum to stop suction on floor. Not a very good design. I would not recommend this vacuum even if you don't have pets."
3,Sizing,Hat is ok for the price. It does size pretty small. As an example I ordered this hat and a similar style in the same size. The other hat fits fine while this one fits my three and a half year old (although a little big).
3,Cap,I bought this hat at a great price but could not wear it because it is too big for my head. it slips down over my eyes when i move my head.
2,inconsistent size and material,"The black hat, supposedly the same hat as the white one I purchased at the same time, is a full inch smaller across the top. It is also advertised as 100% cotton when the lining is definitely polyester."
5,Black Newsboy Cap,"I have purchased many Newsboy Caps, mostly on Amazon. This black, along with the white and brown, are among my favorites. Each one fits perfectly and I always receive compliments when I wear one."
2,Cheap Material,I didn't really care for it. The material was really cheap and had some frays here and there. But you get what you pay for I guess.
2,lb2lb,"This was a gift for my niece, I thought it was more of a wool/cotton texture, but she liked it."
4,"Great price, nice soft hat!","The price for this was great, and it is a nice, soft ""newsie"" style hat. The only caution I have is that it does not fit a bigger head. I wound up having to transfer it to another cast member with a slightly smaller head. But it looks great onstage!"
5,How can you not like Mark Twain quotes?,"Great book, lots of fun. Most fun is the actual truth that is spoken throughout. Some of the quotes make you think, others just make you laugh. Personally, this little book helps brighten an otherwise junky day......Being a Twain fan I cannot help but toot the horn for this book. It's worthy."
4,humor for the ages.,Mark Twain humors many with this encyclopedia of definitions and more.this is a must have for any who want to have a bit of the knowledge of the masterful Mark Twain.
5,Leviton 6515M-W Timer Switch,"Leviton 6515M-W Timer Switch, great product unique way to cut down the electric bill. Product was very easy to install and operate."
5,A B + W Warming Filter this inexpensive?,"An 81B warming filter is used to warm up skin and colors in shadows or overcast days. Perfect for portraits in shade or cloudy skys and flowers, or anything with bright or warm colors. B + W filters are considered the best, along with Heliopan, in the still camera world. Their clarity and quality does make a difference in sharpness. Check out some of the good websites on the net with comparisons.I know that one can make all sorts of color and tone adjustments using digital editing software, but the better the photo is, the better the results turn out. Using some filters, when necessary are very important and can save detail and sharpness that digital editing can remove.I usually buy less expensive Hoya SMC fiters, which are not inexpensive by any means. Whenever I can find something like the B + W for this price when I am looking for a filter, or sometimes not, I grab it!"
5,not just for violins...,I have a taylor t5 custom and use two of these in the winter when the house is dry. Its size fits into the small sound cutouts very nicely. I place one in each cutaway and am good to go. The larger guitar dampit is too large.
3,"Liner notes ""jangle"" the nerves","The music is what it is, and has been reviewed adequately and ad nauseum. The liner notes, however, are a mountain of fawning adjectives trying to give weight to a second-tier band with a revolving-door roster. The Wikipedia entry for the Byrds is far superior to this essay, and and understandably more objective.. Seems like the writer was paid by the word.Listen to the music, don't read the propaganda."
4,WHERE IS THE DVD,WHATS THE HOLD UP ON THE DVD RELEASE OF THE GREAT IMPOSTER AND THE RAT RACE.THEY SHOULD BE RELEASED AS DOUBLE MOVIE ON ONE DISC.
1,I'm still freezing......,"My last heater got overused and I got this one thinking it would be good for a tight budget because it supposidly saves money. Well, you get what you pay for. Apparently, the reason it costs less to run, is that it can't heat anything anyway. I am literally sitting 3 feet in front of the dang thing and it is on HIGH. Can I even remotely feel the warmth? No.I have a basement with very little heat from the rest of the house and this thing is such a waste. Not to mention that if I turn it off but forget to unplug it, I think my room is on fire because I see this bright orange glow from the base light all the time. I wouldn't recommend this at all. It doesn't do the job unless you are standing directly in front of it (within a foot or so...and no, I'm not exaggerating.)The bottom line: I'm out the money I bought this with, out the energy wasted on trying to make this heater work, plus I'm still COLD!!"
4,Pretty good for direct heat source,This type of heater if its pointed toward you-you stay warm. I lived in an old house with 20ft high ceilings-it didn't heat the whole room-just kept me warm as long as I pointed directly at me. It was fine for me. I had an electric blanket at night. The foot light burned out. Bought mine at Cost-co for around $60.I am happy with it.
4,Funny and entertaining,"This is a comedy movie starring Krysten Ritter, and Kate Bosworth. The movie begins with two party girls who go out one night and have a one night fling and one of them gets pregnant. She then must deal with all of the realities that go along with the responsibility of parenthood. This movie was pretty funny throughout the entire film. Nearly everyone will enjoy this movie but it will be especially funny for those whom have had a child. The movie deals with many of the life changes that take place such as balancing work and a newborn baby. The lead character is especially discouraged because of the differences in her life and that of her best friend and roommate. There is a good message and a lot of laughs and everyone should be able to relate to some parts of the film."
3,"Funny story, predictable though","You can't really expect it to not be predictable, but it had a lot of funny parts. The ending was way too rushed. An entertaining watch though."
1,boring,Didn't make it past page 50. So boring. I guess I just don't like books written in that old manner...
5,I love!,"I have a bunch left, but am bummed that none of the local stores sell this product:( But good sale! Thanks!"
2,Ho-hum,"While some of the tracks do their best to be upbeat and lively,this album lacks a sense of cultural authenticity or a vitality of sound. I prefer some of the anthologies available to this dreary effort."
4,A Classic 1990's Album,"The sound of the 1990's is the Alternative Movement. So many bands attempted to copy Pearl Jam. This is the debut release from the band and has such Great songs like, Even Flow, & Jeremy.Ten is a must have!!!"
2,You did not send the product that is pictured.,"Hi, sorry. I don't hate or dislike the product you sent, me, you just sent me the wrong product. You have shown, and listed Pearl Jam Ten, the Japanese import. I received a two disc reissue that is not the correct product. Would you please send me the product advertised instead?"
5,Not for Black & White. For Color Infrared Film.,"The orange-colored B+W Infrared Filter 099 is the ideal filter for photography with infrared color film, which is also referred to as ""False Color Film"" because of its charming abstract color reproduction. It blocks large portions of short-wave radiation, up to 520 nm (blue, blue-green) and reaches its full transmission near 600 nm, which it retains far beyond the sensitization range of these films. This avoids the blue cast that is caused by the heightened sensitivity in this spectral range, and it leads to a better differentiation of colors. The charm of these infrared color photographs is partly due to the orange to red rendition of green vegetation, which is due in turn to the high infrared reflectivity of the chlorophyll in plants. The filter factor is highly dependent on the film and on the degree of infrared reflection of the subject."
2,Misleading description,"When I bought this item, I looked at the black and white photo of the product as what would be produced from the camera. The filter does not produce the same results. For one, it's not really a filter that allows you to see in the infra-red range. It's an orange-colored filter. A true IR filter has a deep red hue to it. Since it doesn't block everything, you cannot see in IR.The build quality is nice, though and those who realize what they are getting will notice it's solid construction."
2,Santa Clarita is right!...this stand doesn't fit the Delta GR275,"The gentleman from Santa Clarita, Calif. is right...if you're thinking the Delta grinder GR275 mounting holes will line up with the pre-drilled holes in this stand, forget it. The only way to use this stand with this particular grinder is to angle the bolts...kind of 'mickey mouse', but it works. Which grinders fit this stand? I have no idea. The adjustable feet are nice for uneven floors. Finish and appearance are satisfactory. Height adjustment is nice & easy for customizing for each person. If you have a heavy duty grinder (8""or larger), and use it alot, I'd recommend a different stand."
1,"Not very interesting, even for a 2 year old","We have had an older Pooh storybook for years. Both my kids loved it. There was a lot to see and do -- songs, funny things that happened if you clicked on the picture, and nice graphics. So when that storybook finally died, I ordered this one. We were so disappointed! The graphics are simplistic, the storyline choppy, there are no songs, and very few fun things happen when you click on different parts of the picture. When you click out of the story, you have to endure a slow listing of options before you can get back to where you were. This seems to have been put together quickly and cheaply and is not worth the money. Even my Pooh-crazy 2 year old was bored silly and disappointed."
2,Its a waste of money,"I bought this software for driving direction exclusively on my PDA , because I had Microsoft Streets and Trips 2006 with pocket streets for the others things, but you are lucky person if you find a address in there; for each 20 searches I found only one so I Stopped to use it and i'm looking for another software just for driving direction on my PDA."
3,A fair representation... of a couple cities.,"If you're looking for pictures of Cleveland, Mansfield, Athens, or Cincinnati, then this book is for you. The rest of the state, though, is largely ignored. Northwest Ohio and Toledo, for example, are mostly absent, save for 2 shots of the Mud Hens stadium.I bought this book because I wanted pictures of Ohio's beautiful countryside, farms and barns, small towns, and of the area in which I grew up. The majority of the rural photos, though, are of the Amish, and their focus is still more on the people than the landscape.I'm not saying this book isn't worth your time. The book is beautiful and the pictures included are for the most part very nice, capturing human emotion and experience well... but again, mostly just within a few select cities."
3,CD Rom,"thought i was buying a book ( i guess i was to excited to find something for my husband finally, and didn't read the description) It ended up being a CD rom when it arrived..I was concerned that he wouldn't enjoy it as much as i had hoped, but Christmas morning came, it ' looked' like it might be good.. We tried to get it to download for a couple of days :D in the end i was able to get it to work. My husband seems to think it is ' ok', not the ' wow this is great' i was looking for, but he has taken the time to look through the whole thing, so It must be good right? Looks good to me :D"
3,No all what it is stacked up to be,Schneider 62mm Grad ND 0.6-4X (502) Filter (65-078916)This product is one that you could really live without more of a sales pitch to get you to use while taking sunset pictures. Save yourself some money.
3,Useful photo filter,This is a good filter. I have found limited use for this filter as the contrast range it compensates is less than what I need. The filter is well made.
5,always wanted it,"I always loved the song wheels and always wished there was more instramental music by the string-a-longs. I suppose there were albums out there, but I was never sure they would be all instramental. I just love this one. It is so much fun to listen to, and many of my friends like it as much as I do. I bought the tex mex teen magic of the string-a-longs and was extremely dissapointed in it because of the awful vocal tracks on it, and the relatively few wheels-like numbers. But, this one is just exactly what I wanted. Anyone who loves the song wheels will like it."
4,Very informative,This book has helped me to identify several pieces I have that I havebeen wondering about. It has helped me to be able to differentiatebetween the real thing and the fake.
1,Way too pricey for you actually get.,"I'll start by saying that I have found reception to worse than the $20 clock radio it replaced. For it's small footprint, the sound is nicer than one would expect to come out of a small radio. However, in no way is it as nice as a small set of decent bookshelf speakers. It just can't produce the accurate highs that come from a seperate tweeter, nor can it produce low end frequencies with any real presence (I am NOT referring to boomy bass here). Overall, the sound is a bit tinny. It would make a great clock radio if they improved the reception, and it was 1/4 the price. That'll never happen, though, because too many people have fallen for the gimmicky Bose sound."
1,rants of a dreamer,"Very short, with recounts of dull incidents which the author, who shows an arrogant disdain for his fellow Westerners, seems to consider fun. The unexciting content might have been taken directly from his diary, which would be fine if he actually had something interesting to tell (which he does not)."
2,misleading,"Unless I missed something this bag was supposed to be 30"" long. Well in a manner of speaking it is. The case consists of two compartments that while together add up to 30"" there is not a continuous 30"" length of space in the case which is what I was looking for. On the plus side it does seem to be a well made bag and I will find a use for it. Just not the one I purchased it for. I would not buy it again there are other products that could fill my bug out bag needs better."
5,Great Old Movie,"lots of fun to watch the old stars and see how a circus is done, and it's always great to see Moses giving directions to clowns."
1,Imaging Units UNUSABLE!,"Price is low, delivery is quick, however none of the Phaser 7760 imaging units we received had authentic Xerox computer chips allowing the phaser to read or use the imaging unit! Our production was shut down for 1/2 day because none of the three back up imaging units we had ordered could not be used. The Xerox technical specialist we called in to repair the machine said the ordered units were refurbished, not new. I say STAY AWAY!"
4,Great Book.. Great Music and Dancing..,..But not the best movie I've ever seen. It can be a little depressing watching this wonderful.. perfect.. prima ballerina.. disappear.. dying of cancer. I LOVE the song that larissa's character dances to foe her Julliard audition. It is very inspirational.
3,Just read the book...,"So if you've read the book, ""A Time for Dancing"" I'll bet you're just as excited as i was to see the movie. The book is amazing...the movie however, well, i'd recommend reading the book and to stop there. If you want more, read the book again. The movie simply doesn't give what the book does. The movie's full of bad music, cheesy lines, and cuts out a lot of important details to make the story come alive at its best. The only reason I gave the movie 3 stars was for its long descriptions of why jules loves to dance because they're so true and because it was trying to imitate the best book in the world so for that, i give it 2 stars."
4,music_lover,"Definitely a good buy, I've been using the same strap for the MSU marching band for a while now and it's held up wonderfully. Don't waste your time looking somewhere else!"
1,False Advertising (Look at all the pictures),"The package came quickly and very well intact. In fact, my issue is not with the product only with what they actually sent. If you notice in the images there are two different items. They sent the large fat one. Not the one I wanted. I guess I should have looked closer, but the pictures should have been correct. This is wrong product. For that, I give it a 1 star. The product itself is very well made. Selmer makes wonderful products and has done so for many years. I'll still buy Selmer, just not without seeing the item first."
1,something fishy,"Seems awfully strange that all of the positive reviewers are from ""parents"" who have only reviewed this one item!!!! I tend to only trust reviews from people who leave multiple reviews."
1,Stay away from Heath/Zenith wireless command products,"I spent the better part of a day trying to get a floodlight and two wireless motion sensors working reliably without success. Very erratic operation, usually culminating in the lights staying on continuously."
3,It was okay.,"It looks nice. It worked as it should. It was quieter than my other bathroom fan, but not as much as I hoped.When the motor failed to work within 6 years, I decided to switch to a quieter fan. Unfortunately quieter models from Broan/Nutone not only require 6"" duct but also larger housing.Since my bathroom already has plenty of light, I bought a 0.3 sone fan from Delta without light. (Humidity sensor is a plus and Energy Star certified!) Now I know how noisy this fan was!"
2,Good looking and quiet but....,"Fan and light combination work great, fan is pretty quiet. After two years of use I started noticing that the finish was rusting. The Representative from Broan said I could replace the outer fixture for $94. Broan rep said that the reason for the rust was because I was not leaving the fan on long enough after showering. Funny thing though I boutght cheap towel bars that match the chrome finish on the fan/vent and they have not started rusting..."
1,Don't waste your money,"This set is a waste of money. The woman's voice is horribly annoying. The music and singing are terrible -- I absolutely don't want to hear those songs ever again. And the lessons are so overly simplistic they are unbearable.The ""Teach Me Italian"" CDs are MUCH, MUCH better. They at least have catchy songs that I don't mind playing over and over again.Anyone interested in buying my set? It's practically untouched and you can have it cheap."
3,Not too durable but totally loved!,"This book lasted 4 days with my son, age 1. The pages are joined by a very narrow binding so it can be damaged easily. That said, I am back to buy my second book because it is such a great toy/book. This time I am going to reinforce the pages somehow."
3,Royal Extreme 7,"The Royal Extreme 7 is a very complete organizer and has everything that makes it easy to use. Unfortunately mine was not unusable due to the fact that it couldn't be read, because the screen had lines through it. The product was packed very well but I think the casing is a bit flimsy. I havn't returned product because I live in Australia and it would probally cost too much."
1,Roya lDigital assistant Extreme 7,This unit will not work with Windows 7 64 bit. Difficult to input data and the manual is poorly written.
2,review,Not user friendly if you have fat fingers. Buttons are very close together & very small. The symbles function does not work.
1,Save Your Money,This Electronic Organizer is a waste of money. The instructions do not in any shape or form tell you how to operate this PDA. In fact I tired so long to get it to work the time lasped that Amazon will allow a normal return. Amazon should be ashamed they offer this piece of junk for sale.Royal Machines Extreme 7 Electronic Organizer PDA with 2MB Memory and 6-Line RoyalGlo Backlit Display
5,Does what it's supposed to.,Does what it promises. Real cheap too. I use it to keep a spare battery charged and it works fine.
3,close but no cigar,"The pulley hoist is to be used to store a 14' kayak in my garage. It assembled well enough but when I tried to raise the kayak with a simple pull of the two ropes, the ropes sliped off the pully jamming the mechanism. It does work but I have to carefully raise or lower the kayak one rope at a time. Ok, but not as advertised. Product should have included a larger pulley to prevent this slipping problem."
1,Total garbage,"The video consists of the words only scrolling across the screen, the audio has the tunes so badly played that the melody is often hard to recognize. The product review supplied is downright dishonest and I feel cheated. One star is too high a rating, but 0 or (-) were not choices."
1,"Wait, whaaat?","I so wanted to like this movie, Joe Strummer, Courtney Love, and Grace Jones in what's categorized by Amazon as a Western. Unfortunately, this movie turned out to be an unmitigated disaster. I can handle avant garde, but this was just unintelligible."
5,"When He Leaves: Choosing to Live, Love , and Laugh Again","A friend of mine from church gave me this book a few years ago. I was in shock. My spouse had just shared with me he was in love with another woman. I was scared and felt all alone. The book helped me tremedously. I experienced many of the same feelings and thoughts that Kari and Noelle shared in the book. It is a book that gives us some affirmation to those horrid feelings one has when they find out their spouse has betrayed them. The authors wrote the book with their heart, spirit and soul. One feels a connection and I appreciate the references to our connection with God. I would recommend this to anyone who is greiving the loss of a spouse thorugh divorce. I have read it through several times and still are growing and learning."
1,Not helpful,"I bought several books on divorce and narcissism and this book was the least helpful of all. I did not care for the format which is random snippets of things that happened to two women before, during and after their marriage. I did not find this book to be of any comfort or help. A much better and more helpful book is Growing Through Divorce by Jim Cloud."
4,"""Battleline"" by any other name","This is a collection of a 1963 TV series called ""Battleline."" Each episode focused on a pair of soldiers on opposite sides of a battle of World War II. It might be a Polish and a German Officer, or a Japanese and a British Officer. This is a great series for anyone interested in that war. The episodes included in this collection are:DISC ONE:Fall of PolandInvasion of NorwayDunkirkBattle of BritainMaltaCommerce RaidersDISC TWOFall of CretePearl HarborBattle of the AtlanticFall of SingaporeFall of the PhilippinesDieppeAlthough the packaging doesn't acknowledge the original series, this is a fascinating documentary on World War II."
5,A taste of Sicily; an ocean of life,"I love the Orange Thief! It takes a bit to get into, but is well worth it. It's as beautiful, funny, sad and human as Sicily itself. And could it be that with all its fruit, almonds, olives and ""batches"" (beaches), Sicily is still so poor because, like Rosalba, it shoots itself in the hand? If you have Southern Italian or Sicilian roots, you may see your relatives in some of these characters, or, as I did, in myself.If you came to this movie for the Italian language, you may be disappointed. There is much Sicilian dialect, so the only recognizable Italian you hear may be that spoken by the prison guard and the tourist - disgraziati!What ties all together is the music - great Sicilian folk music. I hope this group produces more music, and many, many more movies!"
2,The film guys are the thieves,"Aside from the tolerable folk music and occasional pretty scenery, I see nothing to praise. This is not allegory, not poetry, not even good fantasy. A bunch of amateurs pretending to be film-makers. They don't even seem to recognize the difference between an orange and an olive tree. Save your money. This is a waste and a big mess. The film-akers are the real thieves."
1,Entertaining? No.,"I can't believe this got so many good reviews. To each his own I guess. Neither my husband nor I liked this movie. I didn't even watch the end as I couldn't stand to waste any more time. The 'thief' is constantly getting beaten up and seeing his bloody face again and again was too much. The character seems to have no common sense. Poetic? Are you kidding? A bunch of 'thieves' sitting around a fire saying f--- the government, f--- Italy, etc. etc. I've seen quite a few Italian movies and this one is at the bottom of my list. Best Italian movie I've seen recently was ""Ex"" at an Italian Film Festival - Superb. This one doesn't come close."
1,Do not reocommend the RC5910P RCA DVD player,"I received this unit as a gift. I primarily use the unit as a DVD player. It has been *very* disappointing. I have yet to play a single DVD without at least some frame dropping experience. At first I thought it was due to scratched or damaged DVD rentals. I also experience this behavior, however, with new DVD's. At least 30% of the DVD's I have played stop altogether, whereupon the player displays a ""Disk Unplayable"" message. Sometimes this can be ""worked around"" by powercycling the player and sometimes by skipping over the troublesome bit by advancing well beyond the stop point and then ""rewinding"" back to just after the freeze would have happened. All in all this makes for a *terrible* movie watching experience. I would not recommend this product."
3,Not what I expected,"Got this cause my uncle needed a new CD/DVD player for his restaurant, but this can't even play burned cd-r. When it plays normal CD ROMs it works great."
3,Decent Valet,Have had this for a while now. It is decently constructed if not overly stylish. Serves its purpose but not blown away
2,not sure about longevity,"This is the second time in a little ove a year (just outside warranty time) that we had to replace this pump. When it works, it works fine, but when it doesn't, get the mop ready. Unfortunately, there arent many options for our style heat pump."
2,Something must be wrong,"I switched to these after multiple flats while riding through the french quarter/downtown new orleans. i have less than 150 miles on them, they are new, and the back tire has multiple micro slits, one serious puncture, two significant slits that i believe will soon join together and effectively end the tire's life. this is very few miles and they have fallen apart, much of the road hazard is broken tempered glass from car windows, old cobble streets, potholes and street car tracks. admittedly its a tough town, and they are not exactly designed for urban use, and i dont say another tire would have held out better. I am going to try continental gatorskin tires next, but i feel like these ought to be directly comparable.I do like the feel of the tire, the traction."
2,Disappointed,"I purchased the Michelin Krylion tires with great expectations since I have used Michelin tires on my cars for years with great success. I specifically chose the Krylion tire for its claims to puncture resistance. I just had my first flat after only 350 miles of riding. The previous tires that I used had Kevlar belts, I rode two sets of these tires for neatly 4000 miles (over the same paths) without a single flat - I guess I will have to go back to the Kevlar - very disappointing!"
1,Indy release falls short,"Poor musicianship, tin-can production, obscure packaging and songwriting that runs from mildly enjoyable to outright lackluster.Highlights include an ode to Chief Seattle and a track called Lost Bird. On the other end of the spectrum, Monsters of the World Unite and Troubled Man are tracks that should have been saved for the circular file.The glimmer of hope is in the songwriting, the few good songs are muddied by the rest though. Usually, a debut release will feature the best of many years of work. This leaves alot to be desired. This is not an artist to look forward to.One the scale of 0-5 this receives 1 1/2 weak stars.Anthony Chiles, Band of Sound"
5,"read it even if it is not in your plan to stop smoking, it wont hurt at all!","When I bought the book, I thought I really wanted to stop smoking, by the time I started to read it I wasn't that convinced, It just seemed impossible as an idea, by the time I finished the book, i had smoke my last cigarette, and I am totally happy.And now reading his page at Amazon as I am purchasing several more to give to all my struggling friends, I just find out that he died of lung cancer, I'm in tears...Thank you Allen, I love you, and you will be remembered by all this incredible work you did!"
3,It was all right,"P>The intriguing story of Jess and Holly's friendship kept me reading the 400+ page book when it could have easily been 200. I wanted to read stories from the entire 30-year friendship rather than focusing so much detail on the early years. Granted a story about two life-long women friends has been done millions of times before, but that's what this is.Also, the developing friendship between Zoe and Jess is contrived at best. I liked Zoe and understood her quest to find out about her mother. But if the generation gap is everything the authors say it is, is a middle-aged women really going to spill her guts to a 20something stranger just because she's her best-friend's daughter? I enjoyed reading it, just found it a little unbelievable.And why did it take two people to write this novel? Is it a barely-fictionalized tale of their own friendship?"
3,Dread Central review!,"Mirrors makes one thing crystal clear: When it comes to horror of other than the slasher variety, Aja is clearly out of his element. Say what you want about Haute Tension or even The Hills Have Eyes remake, the guy was able to at least build some suspense. Here we get nothing but Jack Bauer meets the mirror spooks complete with explosions and plenty of yelling through gritted teeth. Sigh.Read the whole review at DreadCentral.com!"
2,Vengeful Ghost Deja Vu. Spotty.,"Ok. So here we go again with a ""vengeful ghost"" story.There were just some things that were a bit....inconsistent.1. How often do you really see a person running through a subway where EVERY SINGLE DOOR IS LOCKED? I understand that they needed a reason to kill the first character to get the ball rolling. But come on. That was stretching it a bit far.2. Can we really believe that this Dark Force (that was so omniscient that it could turn water into a death trap) who wanted back this nun was not powerful enough to find her in a convent?It was OK to burn up a couple of hours, but this is not a movie that you will want to see time and time again."
3,"Fun, but Predictible","Watch it in a dark, quiet house and feel the chill!Predictible, but fun to watch.Warning: Might make you want to cover your mirrors!!!!"
3,smal,it is small and u cant even put normal boxes in it :( but its a nice one if u plan to carry snacks.
5,Great lunch box,My 11 yr old son loves this lunch box! At first we weren't sure if it would be big enough for everything; but after we unfolded it; we found out it was. Great buy and Great price!
2,"neat sack, just not big enough","I bought this for my daughter for her school lunch. Unfortunately, it doesn't hold all that she needs for her lunch. Her lunch consists of a sandwich, drink, ice pack, and ususally two other items. It is too small. The two separate compartments are a good idea, but doesn't allow you to put longer items in the sack. For example, I tried to put in a GoGurt, but had to fold it and cram it in there. Luckily, it didn't explode. We are going to have to buy a new lunch box or sack. This time we will go to a store and take w/ us what we want to accommodate."
4,Good,"The lunch sack is nice. I can fit a sandwich container and a bag of chips in the top and a soda in the bottom. I haven't tried any other drink, such as a sports drink, but I don't think the bottom is big enough. It's very convenient. The only problem I have is that the bottom zipper on mine sometimes doesn't zip properly, so I have to sit and patiently work it shut. I bought 2 and my husbands zips fine, mine is just a little more sensative I suppose. Overall I would recommend it, as I think the problem I am having was a fluke, especially since the 2nd one has no problems at all."
5,Finally the right journal!,"I looked high & low for a journal that was clearly titled & created for Grandma to write down her thoughts about time spent with baby. Every other ""journal"" is filled with only family tree stuff. Grandma can do family tree in a seperate book...this one will allow her freedom to share random thoughts and to journal fun things she did with her precious new one. Beautiful pictures too."
3,Skimpy,"My dog loooves bully sticks, and I like Merrick quality. But the ones I received were skimpy, too. I would certainly not have chosen them out of a bin at the pet store."
1,I don't recommend it,"I would like to express my opinion about REA book.Actually, I found out the following facts:*About 60%-70% of questions in this book are useless. They are either very easy or do not follow the real format of the USMLE-Step 3 questions(in regard the length and the difficulty).The remaining 30-40% of questions can be considered to be good.*Many topics are not covered enough like the biostatistics. There are also high deficiency in the other topics.*The explanations are deficient and not so good.The only advantage of this book is that its price [price] is good for its volume and number of questions(2700).I think other books can be better."
2,misrepresentative,"This book is a disservice to anyone studying for step 3. The questions are too short and simple compared to the long and sometimes complex vignettes in the real test. Many questions are repeated in the practice tests, and the material covered was not comprehensive. Look elsewhere for a good question review book."
1,returning after one day,"I purchased this Friday and am returning it today, Sunday. the scale turns off so quickly I do not have time to weigh my food! I suppose I'm suppose to chop the food before I try to measure?I'm going to research the cuisine art's scale comments!"
1,Absolute crap and zero product support. Do not buy this scale do not buy any Salter product,"My scale broke after 3 weeks, I didn't get to use it once. I got it out of the package inserted the battery and played around with it for 15 minutes to figure out how to use it. Three weeks later, I needed it for the first time, I pushed the ON-OFF-ZERO button and nothing happened. So I put in a new battery, then pushed the ON-OFF-ZERO button and got a message of EEEE. That's all it does, EEEE.I was hoping to get a copy of the manual from the manufacturer's website ([...]) but it doesn't work either. If you see the name Salter on a product, run away."
1,Dead after 6 months.,"In using it just a few minutes a month, it went through 3 batteries. I finally decided to remove the battery after use. On putting the battery back in a smell of molten plastic filled the air and the unit died. At least it didn't burst into flames."
1,Very bad on batteries,Don't buy this product. I am buying a new scale after going through 3 batteries in just a few weeks of owning this piece of junk. I am careful to turn it off after each use. The 9V batteries are expensive too. Not sure why Salter went to market with this product. Surely they tested it before fielding. I would be suspect of other Salter products.
1,Awful,"My unit is so dysfunctional that I have to detach the battery to store it. If the battery remains in the unit for more than a few hours, it drains and the scale goes haywire. Aside from this irritating feature, the scale is reasonably, but not terribly, precise."
3,Good book for high school students.,"This is a good book covering the history of the Israeli-American relations with a great deal of emphasis on the impact of AIPAC on American policy makers. The biggest negative for me was the constant referencing to conservatives as ""right-wingers"" with the blaring absence of thus referring to liberals as ""left-wingers"". This and the overt portrayal of mainstream conservatives in a negative light is a bitter pill to swallow, but one most American readers are used to and smart enough dismiss as typical deep-ceded liberal bias. The book is predictably unkind to the Likud party and subsequently minimized the threat of Arafat to Jews and his effect on the two great nation's relations. Overall, I recommend this book because the history of Judeo-Christian relations is the second most important factor in keeping Israel alive and thriving; the first is obviously, the God of Israel."
2,Definitely gourmet,"Originally published in the UK, the terms have not been Americanized. I found it confusing, and I would not recommend it for the average cook."
2,"One song is good, the rest are too self loathing","Fine Again - the song that is included in the Madden NFL 2003 Playstation game is good, but the other songs are just too whiny and self loathing to really matter."
3,Seether - Disclaimer,"Interesting frosh attempt. Talented group with much to build on. Loved ""Needles,"" and I hope they can build future albums around that style. Ultimately, this is a good purchase for anyone's collection. Not as hard as some may like, but the lyrics make up for any short fall."
1,Didn't realize I already had it...,"I didn't realize it until I received it, but all the songs on Disclaimer 1 are already on Disclaimer 2. I had bought the album for nothing..."
5,Objective and realistic,Very objective. The book helps to drop some myths and show you the real true behind poor countries and why volunteering by itself is unable to change this reality.
4,Why we got to be so mean?,"I'am the 1st to admit that I dislike reality shows such as American Idol,etc..because of the weak quality of talent showcased .I do believe however, that Oprah did an admirable job with the talent shown here...Lashell Griffin's song Free and Jackie Perkin's version of Nobody's supposed to be here are perfect examples of this.I'd listen to this cd anytime before I'd listen to an American Idol compilation."
2,Read it only if you are reading this series,"I didn't like this book at all. The relationship between the H/h was too... barbaric. Seriously, it was like reading a novel from the 70s/80s. Honestly, I don't get it, because this author is not generally the bodice-ripping type.If you are reading this series of books, you absolutely should read this one. It contains important events/motivations for the main characters of this book, who will end up as minor characters in other books; for the minor characters in this book, who will end up as main characters in other books; and for the overall intrigue plotline. I've been reading this series out of order as I can find the books, and it's been a challenge.The overall series really is quite good. Don't let this review put you off. Just don't start with this book. Give one of the author's other's books a try first, preferablyA Wild Justice (Harlequin Historical), and then read this one only to fill in this time period in the series."
2,The expected mrs pollifax,"As always, I was hoping for a different plot but not this time. I have enjoyed the author's books in the past. They seem to be formula mysteries. I was really bummed when I found out that the author did not visit the spots she wrote about. Simple plots and an easy read. I have visited some of these places and have to admit her books made me interested in going there."
3,A bitchier Mrs. Pollifax,"I loved Mrs. Pollifax. I would love to be just like her, with her love of life and cool handling of problems. This is not the same women. She whines, the old Mrs. Pollifax would never whine. This major problem aside, the story is okay, the local is okay. Just okay"
4,The original Starter for the WoW TCG,"This is the original Starter deck for the WoW TCG, and if purchased, is exactly what is received. Enough cards to have a starter deck for the game, a few character cards, and the chance for some rare loot (even in-game items).It accomplishes the goal of a starter deck, to sate your desire to check out the game, but feels like it should have included a few more, just for the sake of showing variety. The case is solid and strong, like a PC Video Game (newer) case, and the cards are detailed and vibrant, similar to Magic TCG."
4,Great quality,"Let me start off by saying I am a hobbyist when it comes to photography. I use a Canon 60D with a 70mm 200mm f/2.8 lens. I needed a filter for a auto race coming up in Baltimore,MD. So I started researching filters and filter companies. After a while I became overwhelmed with all the choices and features. I finally decided to go with B+W Kaesemann 77mm circular polarizing MRC filter after reading positive reviews on amazon.com. I was a little scared because the filter was on the pricey side. But sometimes you get what you pay for. I did some test shots and must admit the shots had great depth and color. I am really pleased with this filters quality and the quality of the images it renders. I would definitely recommend it if the price isn't to high."
4,Not cheap but terrific,"This item was not what anyone would call a bargain, but it is a quality product. It is made of quality glass. It screws onto the end of the lens with ease and rotates until you find just the right effect. It can turn a flat looking scene into one where the colors pop and there is more depth. If you rotate it just right a normally blown out sky can attain a deep blue. It will not take the place of a Graduated ND filter, but does help with the sky issue."
5,A fantastic approch to creation -belivable in every respect!,"This book covers an unbelivable number of subjects,in great detail,and all of them were varifiable by our research group. Every student working on their Phd. was extremly excited. Our group covered all the Medical, Biological, and Theological aspects presented in this Book One also Book Two.The Astrology, Astronomy,Embryology and Astrobiology was like taking a graduate course in these and all the other subjects included.If you read both books you will really want to read his others. Every one in the Science ,Biology,and Theology classes have already purchased Book Two after reading Book One"
3,Why pay more?,"I have a 30 year old house that had these timers on some bathroom heat lamps. Both timers became hard to turn in the bathroom humidity and the plastic knobs broke off. Replacement dimmer knobs just broke immediately. I had to look for a specialty electrical store to buy a replacement timers (forget Home Depot or Lowes). The charge at the specialty store was $35 each.Amazon shipped me two of these in 1 week for half the price, and the installation was simple (finding the correct breaker to turn the power off wasn't)."
3,Works until the spring gives out.,"I've used these timers for years for indoor commercial spa / hot tubs. Lots of moisture, lots of use. The last about six months before needing to be replaced. The internal spring gives out. This year I've been changing over to Tork programmable digital timers. More expensive but they don't wear out."
1,Who needs a subsciption to this when...,You can buy this on the newsstand for the same price. And the best part about the newsstand is that you can pick and choose which month one you want. This saves money since every magazine has a few lame issues that only have a few good articles. you can read those at the store and save eleven dollars. I love the magazine but buying a subscription for it is stupid.
4,Very informative...,"...even though I have to agree with the previous reviewer that they do have some favorites (inc. Beatles,Radiohead,Oasis etc) and you find them on almost every issue. But if you sort reviews carefully you'll be alright..."
4,A welcome return to civility and original intent.,While some of the references in this book are a bit dated it has been brought current in this new edition. A welcome reminder of the true basis of Christianity. It renewed the energy with which I pursue enlightenment. A very nourishing read.
2,Jacques's review,This book is highly recommendable. It describes the state of affairs. It shows how difficult it is to test our unique human capacities and also the solution. A brilliant book
1,WRONG CABLE!,It was the wrong cable and did not even fit the Garmin! I phoned Garmin and they said they will send a replacement out. Hopefully when it gets here it wil be the correct cable!
3,Acceptable source - Sometimes difficult to read,"This book is basic for the 2nd. and 4th. Modules of Apics CPIM Program.My Experience for 2nd. Module Exam:The book represents a good source of information as a primary reference. However, this book is not formatted to ease/facilitate learning on key aspects or Primary ideas. For the exam purpose, there are KEY ideas taken from the book that I found on the exam that were not clearly highlighted by the editors, therefore once reading you may think they are not so important.In this matter, the reference book for 1st. CPIM Module is much better and easy to understand (Introduction to Materials Management by Tony R Arnold). For my exam preparation, I complemented this book with ""Master Scheduling"" by John F. Proud."
1,No Textbook Problems Provided,"I purchased this book for a class at my university, however I was unaware that there were no problems or review questions at the end of each chapter. Of course my professor assigns homework, I now have to purchase a new textbook that actually contains the assigned material."
4,Good Film,"This is a good film, but, not a favorite. I enjoy it occasionally, but, not often. It's based on the teen dramatic book of the same title."
2,New version is crap!,"Beach blanket bingo soundtrack kills the movie.It would have been nice if both versions theatrical and director's were here.Now have to buy the old one before it's gone out of print and history is changed once again for the worse.Original cut awesome, stop tampering with our childhood memories.If it's not broke don't fix it.You can't cater to everyone.and other one-liners.You fill in the blanks."
1,It Stinks!,The music is terrible!!!! The original should have at least been included on it.... oh well at least the store owner didn't shoot first.GREEDO SHOOTS FIRST!!
4,Outsiders Review,The outsiders by S.E. Hinton is a very good book. I like how she puts so much emotion in it.I think that this book is a good book for kids my age because it sends a massage to the reader. It does not matter if you are rich or poor things are roughf all over.I liked this book very much. I was always so anxious to come to class and start to read.
5,The Outsiders,"The Outsiders is about some rival gangs, the greasers, and the Socs(short for social). Ponyboy wants to fit in, in his brothers gang. Ponyboy lives with his brothers after his parents are killed in a car wreck. The greasers never had much trouble fighting the Socs, until one night a Soc takes thing to far. Ponyboys friend is forced to killed him in self-defense. Their friend Dallas helps them hide out in the country in an old abandonded church. They are hiding from the town that doesn't want them around, until they are caught by the police. The actors who are in the movie are GREAT! most of them got their start in The Outsiders, like Matt Dillon, Emilio Estevez, Patrick Swayze, Rob Lowe, C. Thomas Howell, Ralph Macchio, and Tom Cruise. The movie teaches young people to not judge others before getting to know them. If you enjoy the movie, you will love the book by S.E. Hinton."
4,"Great film, terrible music","I can't believe the music is changed in this one. To me, it made the film feel completely different and not in a good way. To anyone that remembers the old version, hearing this new one is very difficult. Since it was a two disc set, I wish the second disc had the new version with new scenes available with the old music. I'll stick with the old one."
5,This is the best movie!,"Hi! I really loved this movie. I first read it for literature class, and I totally loved the book. My teacher brought the movie to school so that we could see it. I totally loved the movie too. I mean it did miss a few parts, but overall it was a great movie. And you really should not underestimate it. You couldn't get a better cast then what they had! C. Thomas Howell(which is totally hot!),Ralph Maccio, Patrick Swayze, Rob Lowe, Matt Dillon, Tom Cruise, and Emilio Estevez. You cannot find a better cast than that anywhere. ..."
5,"This is REALLY good, but it does leave out a lot","This movie made me cry SOOOOOOOOOOOO HARD! I though i was having a nervous breakdown cause I kept shouting: ""No! No!"" And I even read the book. But about that. it left out A LOT! It made Ponyboy, Johnny and Dally the main characters when the book is mostly about Ponyboy, Johnny, Dally, Soda and Darry. And they made Soda such a minor character, and they cut out the part where he ran away. Johnny shouldv'e been this really shy looking kid with really light skin, I would say he shouldv'e had light hair, but that wouldv'e totally defeyed the whole book. Another part that they really messed up, was how Dally was practically crying when he got shot. That was just...wrong! And how they ended it there, it shouldv'e gone on. But don't get me wrong, its such a great movie, but its a better book. I think they should make a better version, cause I can name ten actors I think would be perfect in the parts."
2,Did I miss something?,"I fell in love with the book The Outsiders, and have read it over and over, but I felt that this movie barely gave viewers a sense of the plot, let alone the relationships between characters. The story was fractured, and, had I not already known all of the characters' names and roles, I would have been unable to keep track of them. The sense of tragedy at the end was lost on my family, who had not read the book. I highly recommend the book to anyone, but I found the movie to be a waste of time."
3,The Outsiders,"This was a good movie and I enjoyed it, but I did think that the book was way better, but only because it explained things in detail in the book and it was filled with suspense, when the movie just zipped past everything and had not nearly as many deatils in it. The movie was ok but they couldve done better by using details and such, my main point is it couldve been better.Katelyn Puro"
3,The original version was better,"I like the addition of extra scenes in this new edition, but the soundtrack was overdone. Now you can't hear a lot of the lines because they are drowned out by an overbearing soundtrack. This would be a total masterpiece if it weren't for the soundtrack.The original version of the film wasn't as true to the book, but it was a better movie. The best movies are true to the medium of movie making, which does not necessarily include everything from the book on which it is based."
4,The book to me is better,"I liked the book better because the movie left out, of course, some parts of the book. The book was a page turner and the movie was good, but it didn't even tell how Sodapop loved that horse. I think they shoud of done a flash back or something. The movie, for sure, could have more in it and less disgusting parts. I mean the cast all did great. The cast was great. They had great actors. Oh yeah, in the movie you really didn't see that much of Darry. Everything happened so fast that I had no clue what happened. Both book and movie were teardroppers. I'm just sayin' that I liked the book better than the movie."
5,Great!!!,"I absolutely loved this movie! The acting in this movie is wonderful. All of the characters in the movie portray the characters in the book. Although i thought the book was better then the movie it is still my favorite movie to watch. I could watch this movie over and over again and i promise that you will love this movie, especially if you loved the book!"
5,Awesome,I've seen this movie many times and it always hits home about how people treat others due to where they come from. It's also great due to the cast...think it contains the entire brat pack. Greatly recommend it.
5,Great Coppola Movie!!!!,The OutsidersThe movie was shipped to me in a good form and I enjoyed the movie. This is really a classic movie.
5,Seen this many times,I've watched this movie several times and it has classic moments. I grew up in a period that was similar to this. Our high school had greasers and preppies or soch's. Fun to see some of the big names when they were younger.
3,I never felt it....,"This movie was released within about three years after I first read S.E. Hinton's wonderful teen novel. I was twelve when I picked that book up and I think I read it constantly throughout the next two years. By the time I was fifteen, I had seen enough film adaptations to know that they rarely live up to the magic of a book. I fully expected this of The Outsiders. I was disappointed then and I still find it lacking in depth of character and story. I just don't think it was translated well from print to screen. I have a certain sentimentality for the movie, but I think it falls short of all it could have been. In comparison, I believe That Was Then, This Is Now was wonderfully adapted for the screen. I would love to see the Outsiders remade for this generation and given the attention to detail that was lacking in this release. I know people who love this movie, and I do like it, I just don't love it. See it, though. Decide for yourself!"
3,The Outsiders movie comment,"I think the movie was not well planed according to the book. They skipped a lot of events that happened in the book. The some of the setting were like I imaged, like the Curtis brothers house, but other were different like the part and the church. All of the main characters were in the movie, but they really didn't introduce many of them. I imagined the characters differently. The world that I imaged while reading the book was a little different when I saw the movie. The movie didn't really discuss the main themes of the book. Like I said they skipped a lot og events and every thing happened to fast. They also added scenes that never happened in the book. Like when Ponyboy is dreaming when his parents died in a train accident. I think the book is much better than the movie. The book is really detailed. You can picture everything that is happening. While I was reading the book it made me cry. The movie didn't touch me that much."
3,"You Win Some, You Lose Some","I've been a fan of the book and the movie since my teenage years. I now have kids of my own who were recently introduced to the story through required reading at school. We were very excited to see a newly edited version of it on DVD. Yes, it was great to see all of the previously unseen footage, but the new soundtrack was a big mistake.It seems that the director went overboard with the music selections to the point of distraction. There is hardly a moment of dialogue without surf music blaring in the background. Much of the music did not seem appropriate within the context of the scenes, changing or ruining the mood at times. I kept waiting for Pee Wee Herman to appear and dance the Tequila.If you're a fan, go ahead and pick up the new version. The new footage still makes it worth adding to your DVD library. But don't throw away your original version if you own it."
5,A modern classic!!,"This is a classic story with a classic cast. Great preformances by Matt Dillon, C. Thomas Howell. Ralph Macchio. and a young little known actress Diane Lane. It was worth the wait for the complete novel edition.As for the music it is not as good but it does nottake away from the movie. AND THEY DID LEAVE IN ""STAY GOLD"" BYSTEVIE WONDER"
1,Ricky Martin Its A Crazy life,Worse video I have ever seen on Ricky Martin. Seems to be made by a fan. DO not recommend would not give any stars but had to or this review would not go through. If anyone wants to buy it Dont.
1,Came broken on my xt8,I bought an xt8 dobsonian telescope made by Orion that came with this finder scope. Out of the box the thing could not be adjusted so that it accurately pointed where the telescope pointed. I took it back to whe retailer who incidentally had another one that came from Orion broken right in front of him when I walked in. They hooked me up with credit towardTelrad Finder Sightand while it is an ancient design it is made very well. It is also made here in the USA if you care about things like that. ( this was typed on a Chinese iPad )I would not recommend you buy this product. For 30+ dollars just about anything else is better than this.
4,A Telrad is more useful.,One of these came with my Orion XT-6. It's good for bright stars but hard to use with dim objects. The red dot will obscure them leaving you guessing.I've removed it and installed a TelradTelrad Finder Sight. The Telrad projects rings instead of a red dot so you can still see the object. Also the Telrad uses AA batteries instead of a lithium coin battery.I gave this four stars instead of three because this is more compact. It would be very useful for a high powered terrestrial scope.This only gets three stars if you're only using it for astronomy or on a larger scope.
2,Wouldn't recommend,"I bought this book largely based on the stellar reviews I read here on Amazon. Honestly, I felt more than a little let down. The book is centered on a man who has lost the love of his life and is despised by his fellow citizens due to his unwillingness to sell his land for a new Stadium.With the exception of some clever names for the main characters and a bizarre meeting with a football hero, the promised laughs were never delivered. If you are in the market for a few chuckles, I'd recommend you stear clear of this Hole"
5,Scofield Mine Disaster Book,"I have read and owned this book. It was published in 1900 as a fund raiser for the deceased miners. The original bound version is getting scarce and includes photos. The book was reprinted by the Utah Railroad and Mining Museum of Helper, Utah as a part of the Centennial Celebration in 2000. The museum is a good source of information with many stories and video clips. However the Museum is volunteer funded and operated and it is not very efficient. I have made a xerox copy of this book. The one I used and read was stolen out of the Provo City Public Library sometime between 1984 and 1992. Other copies can be located at the Utah Historical Society in Salt Lake City."
5,Don't know how it works...just know it does,"On the first sign of a cold, I have these ready to go. I don't know how it works, don't care how it works, just know that it does. I guess it's the zinc, but if something works you stick to it. Been using these for I can't remember how long now. I take maybe 2 packs over a 2 day period to shock the cold, and it knocks it out every single time. I hate being sick, so I love this product."
2,Purpose?,"I guess if you're in an emergency, then this can help. It comes in a little 2"" x 2"" x 1"" box, completely folded up like paper.Consistency: similar to aluminum foil, I think it's only meant for one use.Once you unravel it, you can never get it to go back to it's original size.I got it for 1 cent, so maybe it's worth it???"
1,"Don't be fooled, you have options","I made a little discovery when I was using my new 60Cx last night. It can be powered from the USB connection!! That means that any old AC/DC to USB power adapter can provide power for my GPS. I am currently looking at a cheap AC to USB model made for the Motorola RAZR (under $1 on amazon!!!). It uses the same mini USB connection as the 60Cx and I just need to check the power ratings between the two to make sure they are compatable. Will update this review with the results of my research.Update 3/5/07: It works! 60Cx powers up with no batteries and RAZR mini USB charger attached to USB port. Lots of cheap options for this charger, mine is on the way for 5.50 with shipping. Also, I wish I could go back and change the star rating as I'm sure there is nothing wrong with Garmins charger, other than it is more expensive."
3,Misleading compatability,"I'm sure the item is well made and would be great if it fit, but as one reviewer has stated, the website encourages you to buy this for units that are not compatible. I bought this along with the 60cx and saw that the 60 series was not listed on the package. I decided to try it anyway and discovered that the pin configuration was slightly different and would not fit. I went to the Garmin website and checked the part number. They too, lead you to believe it will fit, but I wasn't about to use a hammer to try and prove them right! At this point, I don't know if there is a 12 volt power cord available for the 60cx. Has anyone else had this problem?"
1,not needed for my product,I did not need this item as was subjected. I don't know what it is suppose to do. My Garmin came with a cigarett lighter adapter. I did not need the item.
1,another amazon screwup,"like another accessory for the garmin c320 i purchased, this was recommended by amazon...1-it was not needed nor was it the the right one2 after 3 weeks i am still waiting for their return box so i can get a credit.. so far no retrun box, hence no credit...to get the credit i had to go by phone asd their site said i wasn't going to get a credit, even though elsewhere on the site i was told that i was eligible to retrun and get full refundthis was not a good experience , never to be repeated"
1,Don't waste your money if you want buy C330,"I have bought a GPS StreetPilot C330 navigator which it have provided a adapter in the box. Anyway, according to their suggestion, I bought this adapter at the same time. I found it can not connect with my navigator. So this adapter is useless. if you want to buy C330, do not waste your money on it."
1,Don't Buy It For C330,Amazon lists this as better together with the Garmin C330. It does not work with it and the Garmin C330 from amazon already comes with one. Completely worthless.
1,COMPLAINT (NEVER USED THE ADAPTER),"ALL I HAVE RECEIVED FROM AMAZON, IS A HARD TIME, I TRIED TO HAVE THIS PRODCT REPLACED WITH ONE FOR MY STREET PILOT ( THE WRONG ONE WAS SENT TO ME WITH SHIPMENT, AND ALL I HAVE RECEIVED FROM AMAZON IS A HARD TIME, NOW YOU WANT TO REFUND ME $3.00 FOR THE 14.22 CORD I RETURNED FOR REPLACEMENT. ALL I GET FROM AMAZON IS TWO DIFFERENCE STORIES FROM TWO PERSONS,,,,SHIL KAURAANDA PRITISHKARW WHO WAS TO REPLACE THE CORD I CALLED AND TALKED TO SHIL KAURAANDA WHO WHS GOING TO GET EVERY THING SORTED OUT ,,,,,,i WILL NOT ACCEPT A $3.00 REFUND FOR MISTAKES MADE BY AMAZON. YOU SENT A COMPLETE STREET PILOT (GARMINc330) (FREE EXTRA SHIPMENT) WHICH I RETURNED, AND NOW YOU WANT TO CHEAT ME ON A REFUND FOR A CORD.... \WHICH I WAS NEVER ABLE TO USE.......DONALD D. HILL I WAS BORN IN 1929 AND OVER 13 TRS OLD"
1,Nothing new...,"This is a very basic video with not a single exercise that I haven't done before. If u are a complete beginner this might work for u as an easy introduction to the barre, but if you have done it before get a different one...The ladies in the video do have 3 different levels which is great, but the exercises are so basic that it almost makes no difference from intermediate level to advance except for the level of flexibility..Another thing I didn't like is the instructions of both of the ladies, sounded a bit annoying repeating ""good"" between every other word and not natural.I wish I read the reviews before i bought it.."
5,Great for recipes,"This is a must-have for slow cooker recipes. Throw a pork tenderloin or brisket in the crock pot, a chopped onion, pepper and a can of beefy mushroom soup on low for 7 hours and you have the best main dish ever."
5,BACKUP LOCATION HOLDER,PERFECT TO OFFER MULTIPLE LOCATIONS OR MULTIPLE CARS FOR MY NUVI 1490T AND MY ZUMO 665. YES I HAVE TWO GPS'S IN MY DUALLY WHEN PULLING 5TH WHEEL
2,not as sturdy as I expected it to be,"If I had seen the product first hand, I would not have bought it at all. I do most of my driving on back country roads with lots of potholes and I dont feel that my Garmin 72 is really secured in it's mount because of all it's weight pivoting on that small piece of plastic. Maybe for $10 I'll consider buying it again."
3,Kinda big,"If you need a spacious backpack, for camping or lugging lotsa clothes (traveling), its fine. I wanted a cute bag, but it turned out to be too large. Shoulda been more pragmatic. But a decent bag, none the less."
2,poor,did not have the sound I was looking for could not preview on Amazon but really was not worth it
3,On A Whim,"I purchased this film without hearing anything or reading anything about it. I've got to say, it wasn't bad. I really liked their choice of going in black and white. I think that added a lot to the strengths of the movie. I can't really tell you what the movie is about though, because I didn't see much plot when I watched it. But even then it held my attention through the whole movie, so I'm pretty satisfied. It was a nice little movie. The character's were cool, the settings were visually interesting, and again, I'm really digging the black and white. I think more movies should experiment with that."
2,OK but now obsolete,"theoriginalsubguy has it right.I bought this for my ATV and Snowmobile. Works ""OK"" but the locking mechanism comes loose and has to be supplemented some way. I made a little rubber stopper to solve the problem on mine.BUT... there is now a MUCH better solution -- the RAM (brand) mounts are MUCH better. (Amazon has these too). I bought one -- They make this Garmin product obsolete."
3,annoying,"very frustrating to put together. took a very long time, and still could not get the foot rest to fit together properly. would not buy again or recommend. easier and nicer chairs out there for the price."
2,VERY UNCOMFORTABLE!,"I'm disappointed with this.. The lowest setting results in my legs hanging off the edge and it is uncomfortable to put my feet on the footrest rung for very long. The seat isn't even. When you swivel around in it one one side it goes higher and then as it goes around, it goes lower."
3,Add-ons,The floor ring isn't a usual part that comes with the chair so it's not included in the assembly instructions. The two foot ring pieces goes between the wheel base and the lifting shock.
4,Good Chair,"Solid, pretty comfortable. Foot ring is solid too, but not very wide. Took one star away because the arm rests are pretty flimsy and feel like they're going to break when I try and adjust myself in the chair. Chair sits very tall, so be aware of that. The desk/table I use it at is 36 inches tall and I have the chair as low as it will go. These drafting chairs are always expensive, but this one in particular was a really good value."
1,Nightmare provoker,"Parents of children who are afraid of Monsters BEWARE! My then 4 year old Daughter watched this movie until the closet monster scene came on. It went something like this...a boy in his bed with the covers up to his eyes, the wind howling the curtains and window shutters blowing back and forth and the closet door slowly creeping open. Finally an ugly towering monster starts moving towards the boy in the bed. That is all my Daughter had to see! It scared her so badly we have been dealing with nightmares ever since!! The scene ended up where the monster was actually afraid of the boy and cried on the floor but the build up to that is absolutely frightening to a young child. My Daughter cried hysterically. It put images in her mind that have always stayed with her and until this day she's afraid to go to bed."
5,Great bedtime video,"This is a great wind-down video. A great bedtime 'storybook'. My daughter just loves the commentary by the young children in the video as well as singing the easy to learn songs. It is also a very pleasant video to have on, for the hundreds of times it will be played!"
2,Great Story,"Great story, bad animation. It's personal preference, I know, my 24 month old daughter didn't really take a liking to it. I think I would buy the Goodnight Moon story book instead."
3,Toss across not the same,Toss across would have been better if it was like original back in the earlier days. The whole game is smaller than original and you have to assemble everything where as the original came fully assembled from manufacturer. Plus the bean bags are tiny. I would have paid a higher price if it had been same as original.
3,Given as a gift,"I gave this as a gift to someone who requested it. I understand that it was easy to put together and the kids are having great fun. I gave 3 stars because I didn't actually use the gift myself, but I got no bad feedback."
5,"Dark, disturbing, crime drama","I found this book almost impossible to put down. The second book in Peace's Red Ridingseries is a dark, disturbing, wonderful work of crime fiction. The world Peace createsfor the reader is full of victims, devoid of heroes and it seems everyone is guilty ofsome deep dark crime. There is nothing quiet about the desperation felt by the men andwomen in this novel. This novel is the best that I read so far (October) in 2010."
2,Thai Writing Scheme,"As a basic introduction to writing the Thai language, this book presents the basic introduction. It will not be a book that I carry around though. I find the English representation of Thai characters very cumbersome and with little merit. Though the representative sound system is the most widely used method of understanding pronunciation, I have never found this method easy. I started with Gordon Allision's EASY THAI which uses standard English characters to present the sounding of Thai character combinations. Much simpler than what is used here, in my opinion."
5,An Amazing spiritual experience,"I first encountered Ritchie's story sometime around the late 1960's and the experience positively influenced my life. I recently read this book (it gives many details surrounding his life, both before and after his NDE) and was touched by it. It is a delightful experience to read this book."
5,It will grab and hold your attention long after you finish.,"There are numerous fascinatingly wonderful events that George Ritchie shares with us. His experiences touched my heart in countless ways, however, the most emotionally moving for me is the importance of the lesson I learned of not buying into, or perpetuating, the hate in this world. In a society of children using guns in school, pipe bombs exploding in restaurants and poison gasses disbursed in subways, it is all important that we learn this lesson now. For as George explains, we carry our desirable or undesirable beliefs with us, even after we leave our physical state."
5,Spiritual,"This is an incredible experience the author shares. It is a story of life, death, life hereafter and the love of Jesus. It is written by a very astute, professional man who speaks from his heart. I would encourage anyone wishing to explore spirituality to read this book. It is wonderful that the author would share this experience with us. Thankyou George!"
5,Return from Tomorrow,"I purchased Return from Tomorrow along with The Burning Within. Not all of us have the opportunity to return from tomorrow, so those of us who don't are left to learn from those who do. The book is about a young man's death experience from which he returns. Both were good books for different reasons. Return from Tomorrow went into great detail about what one can expect when mortal life comes to an end. I personally found his experience believable.His experience helped me reflect on my life without utter despair. The words of the author served as a soft reminder that enticed me into making adjustments in my life. I was invigorated.Judgment day is not a new concept to me. After reading this book, I am at ease with the knowledge that the Lord will be just. When faced with final judgment, the author's words assured me I will deserve the consequences I receive."
5,Reader Beware,Great book that will be hard to put down. This book inspired Raymond Moody to publish his book Life After Life. Don't start this book if you have something else to do. You might not get to it!
4,Inspiring book that met all expectations,"I am very pleased with my Purchase of this book.I like this first book best. Gives the Account of his 9 minutes in the next life.An experience in WWII army basic traing camp andthen death in a army hospital.A headlong flight as a spirit, then searching for himself, being shown by Jesus things to help him in the future part of his life afterhe returned to his body. Some very good lessons for anyone that seeks to know what to expect when they leave this life. To be where your heart is most centered. To learn to have a unconditional love for one another.I was truly pleased with this book. Reminds me of Embraced by the light only his was an experience where he stayed on earth- rather then traveling on.Highly recommended and pleased with Amazon's service."
5,Val Lewton,"Great stuff. Very controlled, very written, very directed and very filmed but not terribly much acted.loved it."
1,Defective copy!,"I picked up ""The 7th Victim""/""Shadows inn the Dark"" DVD. It wouldn't play on my laptop or on three different DVD players! It's clearly defective. Anyone else have this problem? What can I do? Any suggestions?"
2,what's so healthy?,This is a visually stunning book but the compliments stop there. The recipes are laden with calories and carbs.
2,could have been worse,"But, it could have been a lot better too. The content was fine with respect to case selection. Really, how could you go wrong with that? The questions were often inscrutable, and the typeface and layout made the content very difficult to digest.Dear publishing company: If I am going to pay this kind of money for a book, might I recommend margins?Authors: I am sure your questions are meant to stimulate thought, but remember that I haven't yet written a text book on this subject, and am unlikely to take your recommendations regarding further reading given tomorrow's deadlines. I am not suggesting that I should be spoon fed my Civ Pro, but don't expect me to conduct a scavenger hunt for every reading either."
3,Poor binding...,"The text is simple and clear, adequate for introductory purposes, but the quality of photographic reproductions and binding is poor."
4,"A good book, but not for beginners","You should have some experience with cooking with lots of unusual ingredients before trying some of these recipies. You will also need to have access to foods and spices that are not readily available everywhere. You'll also need some time to prepare some of these dishes. If it works for you, the results are wonderful. Even omnivores will be impressed."
3,"Really interesting design, still needs some work.","I am a coffee lover and I want to love this mug a little more than I actually do. The base where you can store ground coffee is great, and works really well. However, I like strong coffee and the claim that you can store 2 pressings is not true for me. Holds enough for one. The French Press part works fine, but it is not really appealing to drink out of it after pressing, as the screen is not that tight and some sludge gets out. I end up using it as a pot when using the french press, and pour into another cup. The other top is pretty poorly fitted. It works well enough to carry it around upright and use as a travel mug, but if it tips, this top will fall off and spill all your coffee. My 18 month old granddaughter thinks it is one of the best toys ever invented, and will often spend a happy 20 minutes assembling all the various parts. All in all, has a number of design flaws, and made cheap in China, so should be cheaper."
1,"Intriguing Premise, but Poorly Executed","Teen years ago, fourteen disappearances occurred at a small town, including the young son of Dwayne Hooper. On the anniversary of his son's disappearance, Dwayne suspects that a jail inmate, Ronald Perkins, is responsible. Dwayne sends one of his deputies to investigate Perkin's house, but unleashes the fourteen people from a cellar, all whom are now zombie-like-killers!This is the worst movie in the After Dark Horrorfest III. The acting is average for a horror movie, but the pacing is too slow, the makeup effects are horrible, and the dialogue is laughable. I forgot to mention about the countless plot holes! The cops in the movie are unbelievable! Hooper's daughter is a teenager, but I find it odd that she is dating a guy that is probably in his thirties and Hooper doesn't care! I know other reviewers hated the ending, but it didn't bother me one bit as I didn't like any of the characters."
1,Yawn,"Persepolis 2 is everything Persepolis 1 wasn't. In fact it's a bit of a yawn. The author's story of life as a student in Europe is ho-hum. It does pick up a bit when she returns to Iran, but never reaches the heights of the first book."
2,The Charm Wears Thin,"The first novel in this series succeeded because its childlike graphics and gee-whiz storytelling matched perfectly with this subject matter. We could imagine the infant/child author telling her story in exactly these terms.This sequel fails because the issues of growing up and dealing with the disillusionment with one's own culture are much more subtle. The story and the graphics remind us constantly of the nuances that are left out, of the issues of women's rights and humanity that are sentimentalized, of the real conflicts that this child/woman is undergoing that are completely unexplored.There are a few quibbles to be explored: the view of vienna is odd and the little vignette of the narrator peeing standing up seems forced. But most importantly, the mismatch between the story and the way in which it is told ends up making for a read that turns boring quickly."
1,TERRIBLE QUALITY,"I bought this to build with my 10 year old granddaughter. It has been an absolute nightmare!!! The quality of the wood is inferior. Nothing lines up correctly. If I wasn't making this for my granddaughter, I would have burned it. It is so disappointing to put in so much time and money into a piece of junk.NOT WORTH EVEN ONE STAR."
3,For a beginner,"This book introduces a novice to SAP Project System. Written in simple and precise language, this book have several examples and screenshots which makes it interesting.A small modification in the organization of the book would make the flow of thought easy for a new reader. (rather a reader can read the book in the following manner)5 - Implementation strategy1 - Basics2 - Project System in SAP4 - Customizing3 - Practical Example6 - SummaryOverall, the book given a good introduction to Project System in SAP.S.R.

2,So dissapointed,"This was a gift from my fiancé. It is a very attractive watch but with a series of design flaws. The first is the tiny pins which are far too weak for such a heavy watch and band. Also the holes the pins lock into are too shallow. The watch band fell off within the first week and continued until the band itself broke. The crown is unprotected and is easily pulled out from regular wear stopping the watch. Pulling your hand out of a pocket always catches the crown and yanks it out. Over time this has damaged the insides enough that you can move the entire face of the watch with the crown. It has been inaccurate as well but I'm sure that is partly due to the beating the internals have taken after repeated abuse of having the crown yanked. I feel so bad that my fiancé spent so much money on this watch. It is exactly the look and style I wanted, just flawed design."
1,Worth Less,"I have been looking for an Armband for the Vision that looked like you could use it with out it popping off when you get a pump in the gym. I was excited about this product until I opened the box, it both looks and feels cheap and unreliable. Of course I am going to give a try, and 30 minutes into my work out the velcro pads that secure it start to come off the actual band."
1,Cheap,The velcros began falling off after my first use. The screen propector began falling off within a week of use.
2,Too thick,"It is too thick to fit under our refrigerator which is the reason we purchased it. Therefore, we do not use it often."
5,Paramahansa Yogananda has been a blessing in my spiritual development.,This is the best version of the Bible that I have seen. It makes the life of Christ interesting and I feel that I am understanding what Christs message to humans was.
5,I have waited a lifetime for this.,"Yogananda's book is an astounding gift to the world. As a lapsed Christian (Catholic), I had long ago dismissed the Bible as a kind of theological kindergarten. No more! Yogananda's description of Jesus the Yogi-Christ and his teachings transcend anything written during the last 2000 years. An audacious claim, but if you want to become acquainted with a living, supremely relevant Christ, read this book."
4,Thunder Cake,"My students enjoy this story every year. We live in a hurricane prone area and experience storm conditions often. Students identify with the approaching sounds and the uncertain waiting portrayed in this story. Excellent text for displaying fears of storms. We follow this story with sharing of a ""Thunder Cake"" just as in the story. Yum!"
1,LOOKING FOR SPANISH TO ENGLISH TRANSLATOR,"THIS PROGRAM IS BAD. YOU CAN'T EVEN GET THE ""GIST"" OF THE TRANSLATION THAT IT CLAIMS TO GIVE. I USED IT TO TRANSLATE SPANISH TO ENGLISH. IT CLAIMS TO LET YOU BUILD A DICTIONARY BUT YOU HAVE TO START A NEW ONE EVERY TIME YOU START THE PROGRAM BECAUSE IT DOES NOT SAVE THE DICTIONARY. IT DOES NOT DISTINGUISH MALE OR FEMALE NAMES EITHER. IT IS NOT WORTH IT."
5,A must have for Marrieds n Singles Looking to Mingle...,"Well, m an African and from Africa I bought this and shipped it to my cousin in the US as part his wedding presents. I got my self one and must say this is a MUST-HAVE. With people taking marriage and relationship lightly in this day and age, this is an eye opening video I strongly recommend...."
5,Something everyone needs to watch!,I LOVE this DVD.... best purchase I've ever made! This is information that EVERYONE needs... It is guaranteed to improve your marriage tenfold!
1,This Was Really Stupid,"Ghoulies was REALLY stupid. I fell asleep about 3/4 of the way through, and don't regret it. We didn't bother watching Ghoulies II. Ghoulies was so definitely 80's with big hair on the women, punk styles on the men and somebody attempting to look like an expert break dancer. Rather than being a good creature feature, the film centered on black magic, but didn't even do a very good job of it. Save your money. If you want an 80's creature feasture get Gremlins or Critters. Forget this piece of junk."
3,This product was good but not the best I have tasted.,"This chorizo was not the best I have had, I would say it was average."
3,good but I hate when they cut parts,"Why won't they cut only unimportant parts and leave all the important parts, and so what if theres more hours added.When I watch telenovas dubbed in arabic,an 188 episode telenova would be 150. I love watching Telenovas and i buy the ones with engish sub. I wouldn't mind paying extra, at least I would understand what is going on instead of watching 50% of it. They should sub all telenovas so more people can buy them."
2,"Great novela, DVD disappointment:(","I absolutely love,love this movie!! But they took out the BEST parts of this movie!!:( I mean I have to watch on you tube to catch the parts edited out of this DVD:( honestly you are not getting your money's worth. I bought it thinking I would own one of the best novela ever made seriously. I commend Willam Levy and Maite Perroni for their amazing acting skills!! Also the best chemistry between two characters. But you are not getting the full movie this purchase... Sorry"
3,Cuidado con el angel,I enjoyed buy it but i though it was going to be full episodes of the novel. Is there one with full episodes because the one i buy is just a summary of the novel. The shipping was good. It came before the date that it said it will be here.
1,Good Telenovela horrible edition!,"What it's the idea to buy this DVDS when the most important and romantic scenes have been cut!! come on guys, the people in charge of edition made a horrible job!!! Just for saying something they just put scenes of Juan Miguel and Marichuy always fighting not even one scene when they kiss!! they don't show the relationship between Pablo Cisneros and Marichuy!!! what a waste on money they destroyed the telenovela big time!! Go to the internet and download it, at least you are going to see the whole thing! So such romantic story cut it in pieces"
5,Big Brother does not want you to read Terror-Dot-Gov.,"So it turns out that fiction, in the rights hands, can still be dangerous after all. Thank you, Harold Jaffe. What a book!"
4,Posted on behalf of the Salt Lake ColdFusion User's Group (SLCFUG),"-as read by member Kelly YoungThis book assumes some advanced knowledge of coding techniques and advanced Web-based topics, which is fine for its targeted audience. Use of SQL examples I found very useful. I very much like the appendix references Tag Reference, Function Reference, Cold Fusion Resources. The author delivers a well-structured, systematic reference to ColdFusion; just what a developer needs to get the job done, also a handy reference to keep near the keyboard."
5,finally I got the book,"I had bought many other books and they didn't help me at all. this book is great, knows how to teach beginner. it helped a lot."
3,Lots of staff changed in the final release,I've had this book for a while and I can say that MS changed a lot of staff in their latest release. If you get this book you won't find many things the book talks about. My recommendation is to get Professional BizTalk by WROX(10 stars out of 5) and BizTalk Documented by Microsoft Press(8 stars out of 5)
2,Not very useful!,I bought this book with high hopes (The author makes references to Ayn Rand after all) The book is very limited in its discussion of BizTalk and it is a very cursory verbose overview with very little substance. The author continually makes extranious references and fails on numerous occasions to define his terms. Someone needs to write a decent book.
2,Many examples use OmniMark,"This book should be titled ""XML and SOAP Programming for OmniMark Advocates."""
3,Good overview of XML. Terrible examples using OmniMark,I don't know why the author choose omnimark language for many of his examples. The XML/XSL material is very instructive and well presented. The case studies are good in general. I just don't understand why omnimark language was chosen for the examples. This fact alone takes away 2 stars from an otherwise well written book.
1,A complete waste of time,"The useful material in this book could probably be condensed into about 20 pages, which leaves another 200 pages of unrealistic and uninteresting anecdotes, confusing explanations, and rambling. This book would be more accurately titled ""NLP by Dummies."""
1,Yuck!,"This book is, I'm afraid, just as awful as D. Font claims.Mr/Ms Font is also correct in saying that the quote from my website listed above has been cut short. What I actually wrote, at the start of a detailed review, was:'If you buy a book with ""for Dummies"" in the title then I guess there isn't much room for complaint if that's exactly what you get.'And that *is* exactly what you get here."
5,Great book!!!,I loved the book. I read it two years ago and I just started reading it for the second time.
4,Precise,"I had a previous one of these, and when the blade began to dull, I tried others. They were all, in spite of price, inferior to this one. So I ordered a second online and am very happy with it."
4,Quality discs with great colors,"Memorex and other brands tend to be a bit less expensive, but I've found that the build quality of these Sony color minidiscs are better. And since they only are few cents more per disc, why not spend a little more for the quality? The colors allow you to color-code your collection, but you probably would have to buy these minidiscs in bulk for it to be worthwhile. I use these with my portable MD player which can record/transfer up to 6hrs of audio onto each minidisc. The included carrying case is handy and is small enough to fit in a coat pocket. My only complaint is that you probably wouldn't want to cover up these pretty little discs with the mundane labels Sony includes. There's a frosted finish on the face of these minidiscs so that you could write on it with a fine marker, but since many of the discs are dark, they would be hard to read."
2,Terrible,"This book is quite simply terrible. The information thoughout it is entirely useless. One could figure out most of them by oneself. If one went entirely by this book, all Gangrel would be shallow, ignorent wanderers. Case in point: when the book covers the werewolves, it includes, as a TRIBE, the Ragabash. Well, they aren't a tribe (don't know if you know that) they're an Auspice (under what type of moon the character was born). This would be fine and dandy on its own, however throughout the rest of the book the 'author' (it's written in almost a narrative format) seems pretty knowledgable about the werewolves. This, combined with the information that could be easily inferred (or invented), makes the book barely worth the money you'd spend. I suggest you wait until it's on the used rack."
2,A Poor Clanbook,"Clan Gangrel is probably one of my favorite clans for Vampire: The Masquerade, but this book hardly does them justice, or provides anything helpful. Way too much focus on Lupines (although the inaccurate details are a nice touch), way too much. Maybe it's a fine book if you just have a Lupine Impersonator concept, but otherwise, pass it up. If the Gangrel were as this book implies, they'd be living alone in the woods, hanging out with werewolves; they'd never need or desire companionship with other clans, especially in a city."
3,it lacked a lot of depth,"Gangrel is one of my fav. clans and this book didn't do much in the lines of defining them.It didn't ruin them either. I liked the lupine structure to the book, but didn't you over do it?The background of the gypsies and the Gangrel gatherings were extremly interesting. Some things can help the stories, but I recommend this only if you are a true Gangrel fan; otherwise use your imagination. Of course there are a few helpful hints."
5,YOU NEED THIS TO UNDERSTAND,"Before I played a gangrel which was the day I recieced this book my character would never give a gangrel the time a day and I would never have thought of being a ""gangrel"" EWWW to be a ugly annimalistic creature of the night NEVER. They redefined the gangrel to the point where I couldn't think of being anything else. To be able to play a female gangrel and up the appearance and play one that relys purely on animalistic instinct is as she would say....Prrrrrfect...meow kitty kitty I pity the poor full who pets me."
4,"A book about biographies, especially one's own","This book is as much about the search for character and calling as it is an elucidation of Hillman's neo-Jungian/neo-Platonist theory of psychology, termed the 'acron' theory. It is a very readable book, with a lot of biographical anecdotes from the lives of such a broad spectrum of famous personages as Churchill, Josephine Baker, and Yehudi Manheim.Because of this it is a joy to read, and succeeds in invoking a sense of one's own life story as an unfolding drama. One, moreover, that is seperate from the individual ego, and demands its outward manifestation at all costs. This is a well crafted book, and although sometimes quite theoretical, it never loses touch with the beauty of the biographical stories it invokes, and, in a larger sense, the drama of the individual soul desperate to bring its given talent into fruition. If you've never read Hillman this is a very good place to start. You won't be disappointed."
3,"Interesting, but didn't inspire me","I was going to write about my overall sense of disappointment with this book. It's too stuffy and belabors its point unnecessarily. And one of my pet peeves is the use of idiosyncratic anecdotes as if they proved a general case, on the grounds that the writer has some superior sense of the holistic gestalt.But that's my superior sense of the general tenor of this book. It amuses me to see I've shot myself in the foot here. The book does contain a good number of worthy insights, so it's not a waste of time. But on the whole they're sandwiched into such dull prose that you might want to seek this same sermon from a different preacher."
5,The most Thelemic book by a non-Thelemic thinker on the market,This book gives a fascinating exposition of the theories of James Hillman and provides a metaphysic of life that everyone can benefit from. Life experiences of several people are given to illustrate his points. Hillman gives in ordinary language what Crowley spent thousands of words explaining.
1,Don't waste your money,"Unless you have a refrigerator built in the fifties don't buy this. It is way, way too large."
2,sticky operation,"Received this in short order and it appeared to be in ""factory supplied"" condition (i.e. unopened). However, the rotation was balky at one point which appeared to be caused by either a grease lump or perhaps some foreign material that had been trapped during factory assembly. I rotated the outer glass several times thinking that perhaps the ""grease"" would smooth itself out. That effort was unsuccessful so I returned it for credit. Unfortunately, although I received the credit, it did not include my original mailing cost and neither Amazon or the Camera store offered to replace it with a smoothly functioning filter. I offered this option to the camera store, but received no response. In the future, I will only purchase a polarizing filter from a retail store where I can confirm the smooth operation of the filter prior to purchase."
3,Step It Up,"I feel that the scenes of the movie didn't fit or flow together. The realism was lacking. I wasn't expecting Saving Private Ryan, but the tactical movements of the Soldiers were not convincing at all. When securing an area the first thing done is set up 360 security, not pose in front of the camera. The actors were not believable as soldiers. The 'hold a machine gun and scream like Rambo' has been done too many times. The Finnish Russian conflict is one of the most amazing chapters of WWII. I wish more movies were available on this moment in history. At the end of the movie I didn't know if it was really worth spending the money on."
2,Hurts my Toes,The toe box is a little stiff. I have wide with feet C/D and they hurt my toes after 30 minutes of walking. Too bad because I love the way they look.
1,Really disappointing,For a brand focused on quality and comfort they really screwed this one up. The seams under the insoles near your toes are cut so poorly and so far from the edge of the shoe it's like there's a pencil under your big toe.I bought these with another pair of shoes with a $20 off $100 coupon. Since returning them will increase the cost of the other shoes I'm going to attempt to reconstruct the insoles.They also run kind of small.Thanks for nothing Naturalizer.
4,Nice shoe for the office,"This is a very nice professional looking shoe. They are comfortable but are a little tight in the toes. I have wider feet so I opted for the wide width size. Even with that these shoes are still a little snug. They fit fine everywhere else, giving me plenty of room. My toes are a bit squished but I can tell that after a few wears they are starting to stretch a little. If you have wider feet I would highly suggest getting the wide width but still, it may not be enough. It's a shame because they are very comfortable other than that. Plenty of support in the heel and arch of the foot. They also look exactly as pictured and don't look like they are made of cheap materials. I would suggest wearing thinner socks with these, as they will give you a tad bit more room."
2,Not comfortable,"Shoe runs large. I am a standard 10w and this shoe seemed wider than that and it was the length of an 11. Back part of shoe is stiff and cuts the back of my heel, and upper part of the shoe cuts the top of my foot. Not impressed with this shoe. Shoe quality is decent but the cut and size of this shoe makes it uncomfortable. Footsmart also charges for return shipping if shoe does not fit, which I was also unimpressed with."
1,Avoid this one!,"I used this model to store my digital photos for about a year. It made a little death scream yesterday, and is now no longer working. I hadn't created any archive CD's since January, so I've just lost thousands of digital images.Beware..."
2,NAB on DVD,"I really looked forward to getting this dvd as the New American Bible is my favorite translation. I purchased it from Amazon because I usually love everything I buy here. I am involved in bible study and am the reader in our meetings so it was going to be nice to be read to for a change. Maybe I just got a bad copy, I bought it new though. It skips throughout the entire bible, more in the old testament. The reader misses words and reads some phrases over twice. I would expect that with an endeavor of this magnitude it would have been checked and double checked, verse by verse. There are even places where two voices are going at the same time, one faster. Also it sometimes skips whole paragraphs and goes to the next page. I was very disappointed to say the least. If this product is redone correctly I would by another one, but as it is, I don't recommend it to anyone who is serious about Scripture."
2,Is it possible?,"The fact that someone can write a thoughtul,. insightful analysis of social theory and gender -- including literature as part of social theory along the way -- and NOT even include, mention, or refer to the massive, path-breaking, fundamental work of Charlotte Perkins Gilman, Harriet Martineau, Marianne Weber, or W.E.B. Du Bois is mind-boggling. No -- mind-numbing. How is this possible? Gilman is famous for her literary endeavors -- all of which address gender and society -- but she also wrote seminal sociological analyses (WOMEN AND ECON'S being the most famous). Martineau was a top-selling British author, out-selling Dickens at times! She was also a path-breaking sociologist. Weber -- early feminist writer. Du Bois -- greatest American sociologist (see Zuckerman's THE SOCIAL THEORY OF WEB DU BOIS) had tons to say about gender.The book is good and raises some great points -- but leaving out these big names is simply unacceptable."
4,Beautiful pictures of beautiful women,"When I frist looked at this book, I didn't realize the photograph's were taken in black and white. The photograph's are so touching that I saw them in color! I love the way Annie Leibovitz captured the sould of the women she photographed. It is so nice to look at photo's of women that were not intended to sell them as sex objects, but are there to be recognized for their inner strength and individuality."
2,Not up to Starrett standards...,"The good:-- Starrett Pro Site Protractor fits the holster perfectly-- Holster facilitates carrying protractor on a belt up to 3 1/2"" wide-- Provides better protection than having no case at all-- It's inexpensive.The not good:-- Imitation leather material is thin and cheap-- Should have a protective flap over the end-- Looks like it won't last long if used dailyThought about sending it back, but it's not worth the effort to return a $5 item.Should have had my wife make one."
3,woody ole time woodworker,"I was disappointed. I expected higher quality material. But, it does as advertised. Belt holster. Good enough."
2,Poor Quality Finish RUSTS,I bought this product a year ago. I use a cover over the hat and a tarp over the unit as a whole. It is covered with rust on the gun metal finished base. Don't bother spending the extra cash on the finish. THe more industrial looking units stand up to the elements better. Poor quality workmanship is the problem so you may want to buy a couple cans of clear coat if you buy this unit
3,"Not bad, but shy of having the weight it should","This book is well done, is based on a lot of experience and touches on important points.The author is a retired university English prof turned tattoo artist. For someone looking at sociology of the body or anthropology, it may not have the same weight as if it was authored by someone with a background in the above disciplines. Nevertheless, it is a good starting point and has a good bibliography.For a tattoo artist or enthusiast, it is an interesting read, but doesn't have pictures of the work described in the book."
5,What a Read,"Having 4 tattoo's applied last year at the ripe young age of 50, I was fascinated by this book. Tattoo's in the 50's & 60's apparently were taboo except for the underbelly of life. Looking at how they are accepted today as opposed to then is astounding. The syndicate was even involved in the 50's. The book actually had me laughing out loud at some of the situations this highly educated man faced when he gave up teaching English at a major university and took up tattooing. If you have any interest in tattoo's be sure to purchas this one."
4,Excellent Reference,"First off, this is not an identification guide. It is a run down of birding locations in Minnesota. Overall, it is an excellent reference to WHERE one can find certain bird species throughout the state."
2,Too long,"This is a great book, but it is just stretched way too long. It starts out great and keeps the reader glued to the pages. Then the book starts to end the same things happen over and over again and you just think when id this book going to end. Personaly i think this book could have ended about 50 pages befor it did. I think the book would have had a shot at the Newbery if it didn't go on as long as it di. That just goes to show that you cant hve a super-de-duper start but then your ending just really stinks your book wont be that good. You need to have a good ending and a good begining in order to have a good book."
4,Helps toddlers learn about Christmas objects,This book is great for my one-year-old. He likes it a lot because he likes books like this that just show photos of objects. I really think it helps his vocabulary. If your child likes books that show real objects and don't have a narrative then they will like this book too.
1,Great concept...implementation is a total miss!,"I was *sooooooo* happy with this for the first two or three weeks. I would push the button and just giggle at my lack of scooping. However, after the honeymoon period ended the love was gone. The rack started to stick during the rack cycle and make this HORRIBLE thump thump sound. You'd have to nudge it about half way through so it could complete the rotation. The problem only got worse. The problem is that litter gets kicked into the motor area and gums it up. There is no way to crack open the case to clean it. Now the rack part is completely useless. It gets to the half way point and gets stuck. THUMP THUMP THUMP THUMP. I have to manually push the rack thru rest of the cycle. I've quit pushing the button and am back to scooping manually. *sigh If there were just some kind of shield that would keep the litter out of the motor area this one might have been a winner. But alas, this will end up contributing to our ever growing landfill problem."
1,A Waste of Money,"My wife bought this without first checking out the reviews. Big mistake. The weak motor regularly got stuck and the wire scoop would always miss the poop on the edges. The unit was totally useless when we tried using clumping litter. We found ourselves always manually scooping out the poop and wet litter, so the unit was just a very expensive cat litter box. When we got a second cat we had to manually scoop the poop twice a day and ended up just buying a large plastic storage box. If you have a single small cat that doesn't eat much maybe this would save you a little manual scooping of poop but that's about it."
1,Don't buy it.,"This litter worked well for about one week. It has struggled ever since then. Now, only several months later, it makes a very loud ""WHACK WHACK WHACK"" sound in the middle of the cycle, as the mechanism struggles to get the fork to the waste bin. In general, it was always a loud automatic litter. This was not worth what I paid for it."
1,A real piece of...work.,"This was an absolute waste. I've had it two weeks and it's broken, makes loud snapping sounds, has bent prongs and cats who attack it. I have actually spent MORE time with my cats' litter than less."
1,Fundamentally flawed,"This thing jammed right out of the box, my cat hadn't even used it yet. The design seems to be fundamentally flawed. Do not waste your money."
2,Not nearly as good as his others,"I became a fan of this author after reading Newjack, his account of his year as a corrections officer at Sing Sing. Next I read Coyote, where the author joined up with Mexican illegal immigrants and lived their life in order to write his book. Now White-Out...hmmm. I found it pretty boring. Living in Aspen, the author is first a taxi driver, and then he moves on to other jobs, but all we read is about how this celebrity was seen here, another one attended this party with a new girlfriend, another few famous people belong to the same health club he joined. Oh wow. Not exactly riveting stuff. Skip this book but don't give up on the author - his other books I've read get five stars. (By the way, the previous reviewer, Sartin, was writing about the book Coyote, so how her review ended up on this page is a mystery!)"
4,Interesting science-fiction.,"This piece of computers against humans is very interesting. Sure, we have seen the theme before in 2001 but the thought of ""Proteus"" making Julie Christe pregnant is a very interesting twist in this well made, nice looking science fiction film."
2,Disappointed,"I read the book first, and was disappointed in a few things. Mostly that Proteus is totally in love with her in the book, and is a straight up cold blooded killer in the movie version. Also, in the book Proteus was able to access multiple systems and had a human assistant that he broke out of an institution or jail. That dude was hard core in the book, and Proteus would get pissed when he got a boner from looking at Susan. His assistant killed Walter. Plus, the special effects were about as gay as you can get. Even for 1977."
3,Un disco mas,"En realidad este disco de Bahiano no es el peor del mundo pero tampoco regala nada nuevo, no se si es pop, reggae, rock, funk, tiene de todo un poco y a la vez no llega a nada. Si este disco hubiera sido realizado por un cantante desconocido quizas no tubiera ni una estrella, pero con el background de Bahiano por lo menos vendio algunos ejemplares.Lo unico que puedo decir de estos dos discos que ambas partes perdieron, pues bahiano necesita a pericos y pericos a bahiano. si a bahiano le doy 3 estrellas al nuevo album de pericos le doy 3 y media pues es menos mal que el de bahiano, pero tampoco logra nada. Canciones rescatables del disco?, muy pocas, ni el duo con vicentico es bueno. creo q las mas rescatables son ""Asi sera"", "" grandes dias"" y ""mas de mi"" que son escuchables. esperemos que el proximo disco de bahiano se decida por un ritmo mas estable y que nos entregue canciones con mas esencia."
3,I've Read Better,"First of all, the title and cover explanation of the book don't exactly describe the book all that well. After you read them, you think that the story will be about Shylock's daughter, Jessica. Instead, a lot of the book is told by the point of view of Dalilah, Jessica's sort of servant/friend/sister.The main reason I'm giving it three stars is because I don't think that many people would enjoy it - probably only history and Shakespeare buffs. So if you're not into either, it's not the book for you. Also, I was a little disappointed after I read it: it wasn't what I was expecting. It is definately a Young Adult/Adult book, though. The description of the setting, events and characters is wonderful, and the plot is okay. The characters all show some development. It is a good book, I guess, but it will never be one of my favorites."
3,A bit confusing if you've never card crafted,This has lots of great ideas and cute cards to make but as someone who is new to card making even though I do lots of other crafts I found the directions to be confusing with not enough information for a beginner. I kept having to go back to the picture and trying to figure out what they were talking about. I think the instructions are probably obvious to someone who has worked with cards before. I found myself having to read and reread many times.
4,Pretty Good,"Dvd came to us in great condtion. However, it did take the longest to get to our house compared to the others we ordered. But it did come last day it gave as a time of arival."
4,Good but...,"...definately not close to 'the greatest political punk of all time'. This record will appeal to fans of the genre. Don't get me wrong, anti flag is a great band. They put on a great live show and are really nice guys, but they shouldn't even be in the same sentence with bands like the dead kennedys or black flag. If you're an anti flag fan you'll love this."
3,alright,"This is an okay A-F record, the messages are a little more serious in this album than others. They are ""a little more off to the left"" on this album. Actually, anti-flag are socialists.What i dont understand about A-F is they say they believe in unity, love, and peace, but yet they sing sbout killing fascist."
5,Good Book,"Understanding the history of black hair makes you understand the mentality and hang ups we still have today. I have recently gone natural and if I had read this book years ago I may have done it sooner. If I ever get discouraged about wearing my natural hair, I think reading this book will help me remember how proud I should be to rock the hair God gave me. We have struggled to much in this area. Its just hair, your hair. Wear it proud."
4,Great item,"Just what I wanted. I have a very old one and needed more for laundry day. Others were just useless to me, or cheap looking. Who needs individual slots for each hangar?! Shipped faster than expected. Only drawback was UPS shipping. Luckily they gave it to USPS due to snow day."
1,Over the door hanger,This is very flimzy and really not very durable. You get what you pay for on this product. Would not reccommend.
4,Great Shaving Soap,"I tried the proraso menthol for the first time today and I was definately impressed. It is 10x better than the crap in a can I've been using my whole life. I would definately recommend it. I haven't tried the other varieties, so I can't compare them to the menthol/eucalyptus. The only reason it would not give it 5 starts is becuase it comes in a old school aluminum like tube. The soap is great, but it would help to have some modern packaging. Also it's a pain to have to order it online (and pay for shipping) rather than pick some up at the local drug store or super market. I figure the tube will last about a month, so I'll have to stock up on my next order."
5,the best book ever written...,"and title is supposed to be ""Return of the Spirit"" (Awdad il Ruh). This is the best book ever written in my opinion and I have read many books. There is a tightness in the weaving of this novel. the characters are real and relate back to the country."
3,Contains preservative BHT,"Be aware that Diamond Walnuts contain the preservative BHT, so if you're looking for pure, additive free Walnuts, Diamond brand is not the right choice."
3,SOFNIT 300 WASHABLE UNDRPAD,IT WAS NOT NOT AS GOOD AS THE ONE i HAD. i DON'T KNOW WHAT ELSE TO TELL YOU BUT i WON'T BUY ANYTHING UNSEEN AGAIN.
2,Not great,"I use these for my dogs as they have no access to the back yard while I am at work. I was looking for larger, less expensive options to the ones they have at the pet stores.While these are nice and thick, they don't hold fluids for bigger dogs. They do fine for my MinPin but not my Boxer. Just flows right out the back."
3,Not Non-Skid,"Good adsorbant pads, but they slide on the sheets...have changed the outer material from grabby material to slippery..won't buy these again, absorbant or not."
5,Great!,"My son has neurogenic bladder and over the course of the year his bladder has gotten stretched out (we only just got it diagnosed, had no idea earlier but fortunately now can prevent it from getting further stretched. Needless to say he went from a 5 year old size bladder to an adult male size bladder, which no diaper can hold. After countless nights of blowing out his nighttime diaper (even having him go potty before bed), we finally got some of these. They hold everything well, yet are thin so he doesn't even notice them under him. And they're huge, so even when he wiggles around it will still catch everything. Definitely a good purchase!"
5,Why is it all in teensy pieces?,"Well this WOULD be a great toy if they had assembled even some of it!!!! They did not even put the little lights together-imagine putting lenses on teensy little lights- 3 hours plus of assembly- get away from children and find a quiet spot to assemble this nightmare!! Also the instructions are pictorial only, the pieces are bagged completely randomly and related pieces could be separated into 4 different bags and are NOT numbered!! They should pay me for assembling this for them- NOT what I would expect from such an expensive toy. Every other Playmobil set we've bought has been completely or mostly assembled AAAARGH!"
5,Love THE ANTIQUE TRADER,"If you are interested in a 2004 updated value guide for antiques and collectibles, I highly recommend THE ANTIQUE TRADER! The editors went to the experts, unlike some other authors who think they know all, you can rely on this value guide. I also recommend The Antique Trader's guide on Porcelain."
3,Emotion before craft,"Another tome from someone who's paycheck comes from a University rather than readers. And she teaches the same. These type of writers should get out of their ivory towers and into the trenches and learn their craft, especially before they set out to teach others. This book was strong on emotion, but weak on craft."
1,Useless,The car shield arrived in an open box with no signs of ever having been sealed. The instuctions for installation were vague. A critical mounting piece broke making the entire car shield useless.
4,tackle the problems to learn OO,"If you need to practice your Java object oriented coding, try using Garrido's book. He gives many example problems in pseudocode. These are very well suited to you taking them and manually translating that pseudocode into Java.Think of this perhaps as similar to a Schaum's Outline book of problem sets.Of course, you can also do the obvious of learning the object oriented aspects of Java from the book. But basically any book on teaching the general properties of Java tends to cover this to some fashion, since Java is fully object oriented. Garrido's book is a little more distinctive in having a collection of problems in pseudocode put right in front of you."
1,Lovely book if it had some math in it,"Some people seem to be confused about the difference between math and political indoctrination. Saying this is a book about math is like saying ""Miles of Smiles: 101 Great Car Games & Activities"" is a book about cars. You may have a good reason to read this book, but learning math cannot be it."
3,Not a Beginer's Book a,"This book starts with an excellent overview and basics. By the time you come to 3rd day, Everything looks strange.Author fails to explain properly. Most of the codes do not work and comes up with errors. If you are a beginer to VB.NET do not make the same mistake of buying this book as I did. Their website do not offer any fixes either."
4,"pricey for what it is, but it works","This is pricey for what it is (a big piece of molded plastic), but it does what I wanted it to do.I am short and bought a medium-sized balance ball to use as a chair (a small ball, which is the size recommended for my 5 foot height, wouldn't let me reach my desk!) To solve the problem of my feet reaching the ground, I have a foam footrest. Unfortunately, if I moved at all, I would sometimes start to roll off the ball completely and could not stop myself. (Dangerous in a small space.) This base works - now I can't fall off the ball!"
3,a pleasant read,"A story of a small Welsh village and two 'Englishmen' from the Ordinance Survey who have come to measure the height of the local high point, which they term a hill to the outrage of the villagers, who take extraordinary steps to upgrade their hill to a mountain and romance enters the life of the younger of the Englishmen. Altogether a gentle and entertaining read."
5,Good stroller. Substantial but light. Great price.,"This stroller is very easy to use and to carry. My one year old is super comfortable in it, and the sun shade has good coverage. The storage is small, and I can understand why some people complain about kicking the wheels, or the handles not extending out far enough. For long walks we use a jogger stroller. This is perfect for errands, short outings, crowded spaces, airports, etc. It is SO SO SO much better than the cheapo flimsy kinds of umbrella strollers, and SO SO SO much more reasonable than paying $[...] for something just a tad bit fancier."
3,Buyer Beware,"I bought this stroller to replace a large and cumbersome stroller. I needed something for my two year old, and chose the Chicco because it is lightweight and has a five-point harness. Like other reviewers, my husband and I do sometimes kick the back wheels while walking, but overall we have managed alright. The stroller functioned fine for a while, however upon closing it last week (after only a month of use), one front wheel bent. I was able to bend it back enough so the stroller works, but the wheel skips and is not steady. I contacted Chicco directly and they were delightful and are sending a replacement wheel assembly out today. Not sure how long this stroller will last. Hoping is goes for about a year. (Was going to return it directly to amazon for a replacement, but apparently this stroller is no longer available!?)"
4,Good for the money,"Can't beat the price of the C6. I got this to leave at the grandparents' houses. It's not perfect (kind of hard to maneuver, impossible to fit into carry bag) but it serves it purpose. I like that you can tilt the canopy to block the sun from all angles. Mesh basket below is tiny. Folds up really small - no complaints there. In all, you can't really beat this value, but I wouldn't want this as my every-day stroller."
3,Not as convenient as I'd hoped...,"I purchased this for the same reason as many others: I needed a lightweight stroller that would fold up easily, especially for taking public transit. When it's open, it's great. The problems arise when I try to fold it. The latch mechanism is useless. It's a c-shaped piece of rigid plastic that is too tight to fit over the stroller's side shaft. No matter what I do, I cannot get it locked. I have to hold the stroller closed manually whenever I board a train or bus, which completely defeats the purpose of a fold-up stroller, doesn't it? The second problem is the WAY it folds. My last stroller folded up with all four wheels on the bottom--nice and neat. This one collapses downward, so one set of wheels is at the top, the other at the bottom. On a rainy day, I end up with muddy hands and dirt on my clothes. I think this may have been designed by the same guy who did my kitchen..."
4,Decent product,I like the quality and design. The only complaint i have is a canopy. I had a hard time to install it. There should be a better way to put it on or remove it.
3,Great for an Umbrella Stroller,"For what it is, it's great. Better than any other umbrella stroller out there. My only big problems with it are that the handles are a bit wobbly and my feet do sometimes hit the wheels. I am not a fan of that at all. My main reason for buying this was the height, it's actually taller than my full size stroller, so I don't have to be bent so far over when pushing, but I do still have to lean a bit. I had no problems with my son fitting in the stroller and he is a pretty big boy. Tall and a bit chubby, but he had no problem fitting in the stoller at all. The straps adjust so he will definitely fit in this thing for a while, which is awesome. I just wish there weren't so much wobble in the handles and I didn't step on the wheels."
1,Shoulder Harness Difficult to Connect!,The lap portion of the 5-point harness is well designed. The shoulder harness attachment scheme is very difficult to use and pinches fingers. The shoulder harness makes an otherwise OK stroller not worth buying!
4,Good Lightweight stroller,"I live on the third floor and carry this up and down every day with my 3 month old. The back goes down just far enough for her to sit, and works great for my height (5'6""). I do kick the wheels if I'm taking full steps, but overall I love this stroller."
2,Harness complaint,"My husband & I liked this stroller because it was affordable and would fold up nicely but when we started having problems with the harness system, we started looking for a new stroller. Our son is 14 months old and well within the weight limit for this stroller but the waist harness would not extend out any further and we could not adjust the crotch strap which would make the waist straps and buckle dig into his legs leaving marks. The major problem with the harness is that twice I have caught a small amount of his leg meat or my husband & I's fingers in the clasp contraption because it is so limited in the space available to get him properly strapped in. I would have given this a 4 star if it weren't for the harness system and the way it was poorly designed."
2,disappointed,"everyone talks about how uncomfortable the stroller is for them.what I'd like to note is that it's very uncomfortable for my 1 yr old as well. The seat does not go in enough to where he's in a comfortable position. he always looks like he's about to slide right down if not for the harness. even in the reclined position, he's uncomfortable.i would also like to agree to the comment about the clasp being hard to latch. i too have pinched myself on more than one occassion."
1,Wheel Broke after 2 months,Loved this stroller when we first got it. But unfortunately after using it only two months one of the wheels broke off and I can't find a replacement for it.
4,"Lund 602005 Bi-Fold Loading Ramp - 30"" X 77"", 1,500-Pound Capacity",I have been looking off and on for a long time have seen a lot but none really did it for me until I saw this pair they are just what I was looking for. I am really pleased with them.
4,Rest here before your gone,"I keep saying I don't like country music. Then someone like Mary Chapin Carpenter comes along and blends her piano or guitar with maybe a fiddle, adds poetic lyrics and husky voice into a magic that is hard to match in any style of music. Let go of the songs that don't hit your ear perfect the first time because you should be able to find something that makes you listen over and over. Then it becomes clear you have found something special to hear. I would give it 5 stars but I don't love EVERY song - just most of them.From Between Here and Gone:""I thought a light went out, but now the candle shines.I thought my tears wouldn't stop, then I dried my eyes.And after all of this, the truth that holds me here,Is that this emptiness is something not to fear."""
2,So disappointing,"Mary Chapin Carpenter's new album ""Between Here and Gone"" should more aptly be entitled ""Between Dull and Boring."" Having been an ardent follower of Carpenter's music for over a decade, I was disappointed to find that her usual mix of energy, wit, and insight had been replaced by wondering, flat melodies and angst-ridden ramblings. Except for maybe one or two tracks that are mildly enticing, the whole album plays like one extremely long, drawn out song that you hope will pick up but never does. All of the songs on this new album were penned exclusively by Carpenter, which could explain the monotony and highlights the fact that some artists may need collaborators to reach their full creative potential. Whatever the case, this latest effort falls way short of any of her previous work. Let's hope it is just a fluke, and that Mary gets on a good antidepressant and back to making the kind of music we've come to love and expect from her."
4,It works!,"Bought this to replace the lost power cord for my JX8P keyboard, since Korg no longer carries it. Got my keyboard back in commission just fine. It also arrived several days ahead of schedule!"
2,doesn't anyone proof these books?,"While the story had some promise, Faith, pretty, poor and in trouble, is rescued ""from a fate worse than death"" (and I leave you to figure that out) by the handsome green eyes Lord Vigilante, Lord Carrington. But the story was so predictable and there were several literary mistakes (wrong names, titles, etc...) that it was not an especially good read. How on earth Faith did not realize Lord Vigilante and Lord Carrington were one in the same was silly."
4,Good resource,"This book does a good job at looking at Remi's texts and providing criticism, though some of the arguments (specifically relating to the concept of a matrilineal line in La Manekine) don't hold much water. A good book and very informative on texts that very few people seem to have written on. Invaluable to my thesis."
5,Nothing Compares to the Might of the Lepus,"This movie was better than I expected, and quite amusing. WB did a good job with their DVD, despite the theatrical trailer being the sole extra. It's worth picking up for fans of monster movies featuring giant animals."
3,fun well acted over the top horror flick,"If you don't like over the top horror movies that the humour comes unintentionally then this one isn't for you , but if you love horror movies in which a cop tells people giant killer rabbits are coming and noone even questions him then this one is for you. The actors in this movie were all fading a listers like rory calhoun , janet leigh , and stuart whitman, and deforest kelly (may they all rest in peace) and they give their usual excellent performances and that takes alot of talent when faced with being in a movie about giant killer rabbits munching on people. I also like that this was shot in rural arizona and that adds to the fun. The effects look good for their day too which we must remember that this was a film from 1972. The movie goes at a quick pace and it's so absurd yet fun that you have to smile while you watch it. Th film print looks pretty decent on this one too."
2,Good Cast But What Are They Doing Here????,"It's wabbit season folks and that's not all, it's huge like giant like weally big wabbits and they are snacking on people, sound tasty?All this film really needed was to name one of the main characters Elmer and easily called it a Warners tribute.Rates right up there with The Food Of The Gods and Frogs as being nature revenge nightmares in every sense of the word."
2,nope; didn't like it,"I used to see this one on the video store shelves years back, and I thought it was a bad idea then, too.Thought maybe now that I appreciate bad movies a little more that i'd like it. I was wrong.It's not scary, not really gory, and its way too boring for a long time in the middle.Killer rabbits seem like a more creative idea than they actually are, as proven by this film. It's not the worst movie I've ever seen, but it's still crap."
4,Very Cute,"I like this whimsical deck it's cute & it always puts a smile on my face I always think of Endora,Sam,Tabitha and Darren.My 9 yr old likes them too she says they're ""Very Friendly""."
5,Works Great - Dell D830,"I bought this RAM to double the memory in my Dell D830. I'm now running 4GB (the other stick is a factory 2GB stick). I wanted the extra RAM due to doing some virtualization (basically it is a memory hog). I was slightly concerned about compatibility, but everything worked out fine. I am very pleased with the purchase, the price, and the performance. I've always bought and never had a problem with Kingston."
3,"Sexy Voice, Pleasant Album","Ari Gold has a wonderfully sexy and expressive signing voice. And it is used fairly well in this album. ""He's On My Team"" is fun. ""Do You Really Want 2 Hurt Me"" is a simplistic remake. Liked this album and will look for more Gold in the future."
1,The feed that never comes,The information contaned in this blog is top of the line science and technology info. Problem is that I have received only one update in a month. This is not what I pay to receive.
4,Sexy Fun,"Jaine Bright lives up to her name: She's as bright -- and explosive -- as a firecracker. But after three broken engagements, the heroine of this breezy new tale from Ms.Howard (All the Queen's Men) has given up on finding Mr. Perfect. When Jaine and three pals engage in some risqué girl talk about what they want in a man, their tongue-in-cheek list gets leaked to the local newscast. Soon, they're being pursued by the national press -- and one particularly offended, and psychotic, killer.Jaine takes refuge with her next-door neighbor Sam Donovan, a hunky cop who, as Howard pantingly describes, measures up on all counts. Their white-hot affair takes up so much of the book that finding the murderer seems almost an afterthought. Sam's police work cracks the case, but by the inevitable showdown, it's clear that Jaine is one woman who doesn't need rescuing.A quick sassy read."
1,I didn't even finish it,"I love Linda Howard...I have read every book she has ever written. I was so disappointed with this book, I didn't even finish it. If you like Linda Howard, don't waste your time with this one. She must have been under deadline when she wrote this."
4,"Not just a romance, but a story of turning points","I really enjoyed this story of Niema and John. Niema has grown by the end of the book and sees that she needs to move beyond her past. John has taken a chance and trusted another person with himself.Eric's name is mentioned twice in the book but hardly more than to snag you! Louis and especially for me, Laure are people I want to see again and hope they overcome the problems that Laure faces.Even Cara Smith looked like a character that had the opportunity to grow. Maybe not, but maybe!For the reviewer that wants Chance MacKenzie he is going to be out in midyear 2000 as a Silhouette Intimate Moments. No info on title yet.Happy reading!"
4,Solid 4 Star read,"Not as good as my favorites, Cry No More and Son of the Morning by Linda Howard, but lots of action and very steamy. A keeper."
2,tired adventure,"I was disappointed in this book, and that's a first for something by Linda Howard. It has a great opening, but somehow never seems to get offthe ground. I felt I never got to know the heroine, her background, the details of her life, all the things that have made other Howard female characters so compelling. I await her next book."
4,Very Good,"I enjoyed this book very much. Once I started reading, I could not put it down. It was filled with supense and action as well as romance. I'm not quite sure why it is called ""All the Queen's Men"" because it has no reference to the Queen or her secret service. I was rather thinking the story line would have a twist or two, but no such luck. That is the only reason I am not rating this at a five. No surprise ending, no unknown killer, just romantic suspense. All in all, a good read."
4,Intrigue and Secrecy,"The story starts out on a CIA mission that goes wrong. Neima and her husband are contract workers for the CIA deep inside of enemy territory. John Medina the legendary Black Ops leader, whom many think is a myth, blames himself for tragedy of that mission and has always felt a pull to Neima.LH pulls the reader quickly into the life of intrigue and secrecy. She also shows how people who live this life may yearn for normal lives but there are some things that they think are more important. She does a good job of pulling the reader/listener into the story and pulling for the heroes.If you have liked her other stories or those of JD Robb or Julie Garwood you will like this one."
4,This CD is pretty good,"The only other time that I heard the ""Haffner"" symphony performed, was at a live performance. This isn't as good, but it is a pretty good recording. The violins squeak a bit during all three of the symphonies, but other than that, these are a great bunch of recordings."
2,Got my money back,"Hundreds of writers have waded into the Arthurian waters and some have come away with great books. This isn't one of those times. The Guinivere in Dragon Queen is so perfect she's just a card board figure. The ruin of Merlin's character isn't even worth talking about. I bought it at 8:15 AM read it, didn't like and by 4 PM I got my money back."
2,not the best i've read,"i was really looking forward to reading this book,due to the fact that i loved ABs Wolf series.i even conideed buying it when it came out in hardback,but didnt have the money.i am glad i didnt.i checked this book out from the library,and the book started off well enough,but i just got bored with it.i guess its just me,i just didnt like this boook.it did have its moments,and those were the parts between Guinevere and Blackleg,hence the two stars.i fought urges to close the book for good at so many time,because i always finish what i start.it just could have been so much better.i expected more from Ms.Borchardt after her wolf novels.i hope the sequels are better"
1,Dragon Queen,"First of all, Merlin is supposed to be a ""good"" wizard, but for some reason he's evil in this book. The books prologue was stupid as well, the author talks badly of books and how she can't believe she wrote one or something like that...i lost interest in this book by the time i read the first two pages, but I read on until the end just the same. I nearly always finish a book. I love fantasy books and stuff about magic and all, but this book is more about dark witchcraft kind of stuff that is just completely satanic and stupid. It's a book for pagan wiccans and people like that."
4,"Nice, Solid Lamp","This is a nice, heavy, solid, attractive lamp. It came very well packed, aside from the flying styrofoam that you'll inevitably have to vacuum up after you take all the components out of the box. The shade is elegant and apparently well made. The only complaint I have is that the arms that hold the bulbs are not that solidly fixed in position. After you pull the chains to turn the bulbs on and off a few times, they have a tendency to droop. I haven't yet figure out how to completely secure these arms. Still, even if they droop a bit, it doesn't affect the function or appearance of the lamp. I'd say this is a pretty good value. The picture is accurate."
5,Action!,It was pretty cool! It may be one of my favorite books but I have not read them all yet! Rachel gets amnesia and the rest of the animorphs gets attacked by the Veleek! A dust monster! You have to read this book! . Come on if you don't you will miss out on some action! So go ahead and by it! You will not regret it!
2,this boring book,This was the most boring book i have ever read. i do not recomend it to anyone. The three different storines in one book about the same person is very stupid. I think dean koontz was on drugs or something when he wrote this book. i didnt even want to read the rest of it it was so boring. steven king is a much better writer if you want a good book to read pick up a steven king book!
2,slow start,I am finding this a very hard book to get into 40 pages in and it is weak-should I go on? will it get better? and is it worth it to read all those pages? Maybe he has abetter book.
3,A fairly good Dean Kontz Novel,"Dean Kontz seems rushed and hurried though-out his writing of this book. The multiple plots blend and blur in places leaving the reader confused and at times bored. Many of the plot turns and twist are predictable, which is unusual for a Kontz book.Most of the novel is set in the past and many details of present day creep into the story further confusing the reader as to the actual time frame that the events happen.The ending is almost as rushed, but not quite as rushed, as Phantoms, leaving you feeling a little cheated.If you are a died in the wool Dean Kontz fan this is a must read. If you are new to Kontz you might want to start on other better examples of his fine work."
1,Better Luck Next Time,"I read the first eight chapters and thought, ""Yuck!"" The good characters were so syrupy sweet that I wanted to puke right alongside Enoch Cain. I guess that's why he pushed that perfect wife of his off the tower, right? Anybody out there agree with me?? I continued up to the part where Barty's parents are involved in the car accident. The perfect husband names his son before he dies, and the couple share a 1970ish melodramatic goodbye. Then I put the book down. I talked to a friend, who is also an avid Koontz fan, who told me that the ending was lame. Some reviewers agreed. I'm sorry to be such a harsh critic on this one, but Koontz should have worked on his characters some more. Some reviewers complained that the story was too drawn out. I like long stories, if I care about the characters. Sorry, Koontz. Better luck next time."
5,"Love, love, love Koontz!","This guy has the perfect blend of what I love in a novel. Gripping stories that make me think. A bit of the beyond and a lot of the here and now. The ending was a bit quick after a long read, but the rest did not lose its luster.Rock on Dean. Don't even think about retiring like the other."
4,Separate Lives with One Connecting Force,"In Bright Beach, California, Agnes Lampion holds her newborn son Bartholemew. Even though she has just experienced a terrible tragedy, her son will give her the will to go on. In San Francisco, Celestina White watches her sister die in childbirth. She vows to hate the baby, which was conceived during a brutal rape, but her sister's last words inspire her to raise the baby as her own. In Eugene, Oregon, a killer decides upon an evil mission to dedicate his life to. Unbeknownst to any of them, they are somehow connected and will all come together with a new understanding of themselves and the world around them.As usual, Dean Koontz creates strong and complex characters. His tale of tragedy, human compassion, and inspiration is well written and excellently paced. Although I would not consider this book one of my all-time favorites, I would definitely pick it up and enjoy it again."
4,A Thrill Kill,"From The Corner Of His eye, is a novel of suspense and intrigue. It holds you in a grip of both fear, terror, and ultimately compassion. It is a story worth reading,with its never ending plots of dangerous twists and turns, Dean Koontz will leave you breathless and inevitably wanting his next novel. However, the mysterious ending of the novel, prevented me from giving the novel the full five stars."
1,"Another ""Easier/Softer Way "" Book","I began reading this book several years ago just as my problem drinking crossed the line into full blown alcoholism. I had never tried AA but had listened to drinking associates who had...half heartedly. In fact, this book was given to me by one of these people. One who had read it and was still drinking unsuccessfully. All it did for ME was set me up for another failed attempt at quitting on my own. The only thing that has worked - so far - is treatment and a committment to the AA program. Its been proven to work over and over. Why go anywhere else?"
5,"""My kind of Death Metal""","Seems to me that nowadays most death metal bands are focusing on the technical side of the genre which is becoming quite a fade, and furthermore most of the newer technical death metal music sounds very weak because it's missing the fundamental elements of what gives death metal it's darkness and abrasive heaviness .That is why I am grateful for bands like Drawn and Quartered who are taking death metal on the path to true evolution, the way it should be."
1,Carla has an irresistible voice,"Before everyone boos me for giving this cd a one star rating, please allow me a chance to defend this rating.To start with, Carla has a real smooth and exciting voice. It is really what I would call a great voice. Carla will definately entertain you with this voice, if you give her a chance.The whole reason for such a benign rating was because of her repertoire and not her performance. You see, Carla is like most artists, she wants to write original songs and perform them. This to me is a big turn off. I am of the old school that requires old standards. For this project there were not very many old standards offered.Carla definately has a bright future and I will buy more of her cds when they become available, but I will be looking forward to her recording more old standards."
3,Don't feel strongly one way or the other...,"Nice enough, but it didn't set my world on fire. If you like her, you'll like this one plenty. It just didn't evoke any strong feeling in me one way or another, and that happens sometimes!"
5,A treat for EZ fans,"I am a huge fan of Elizabeth Zimmermann's knitting and writing. I have all of her other books, but this book allowed me, a relatively new knitter, to have her newsletters in one place. The photos and added text from her daughter, Meg Swansen, make this book a real treasure. I highly recommend this book for serious knitters."
5,Maravillosa grabación!!!,"Es realmente maravilloso apreciar este grupo de grabaciones no antes publicadas por un sello discográfico y apreciar a plenitud del virtuosismo increíble de esta leyenda del piano de todos los tiempos: Vladimir Horowitz.Excelente interpretacion de Clementi y Scarlatti y como siempre impresionante al tocar Scriabin. Muy hermosa esta obra de Medtner ""Fairly Tale"". Obviamente es destacable que esta producción recibió un Grammy al Best Classical Performance - Instrumental Solo Without Orchestra en 1992.Todo buen melómano debería adquirir este producto, un verdadero tesoro!!!"
1,So basic as to be insulting and it's boring to boot.,This book was used in an MBA class at UMASS. Goes to show you what the MBA program is like there. And this Lacey guy is the head of finance. Go to Tuck.
1,This is a terrible product,"I was unfortunate enough to have purchased this item. I had to return the 1st unit I purchased after a couple of days because it was making a terrible noise. The 2nd unit's video card failed after 4 months. Because I was stupid enough to think that HP made good products, I didn't purchase an extended warranty. HP makes it as difficult as possible to get anything fixed under the standard warranty. The HP staff is very little help and close to rude in my opinion. You have to ship the unit to some place, but since I had something on the hard drive that was sensitive, I asked for the part so I could have someone competent fix it (I now believe that all of HP products and staff are worthless). They won't even ship the part so I have to go to great expense and time to have it fixed. I will never buy *anything* from HP again!"
1,"BEWARE, THIS IS NOT A 1080p TV","The Samsung LS-4695D is advertised as a 1080p TV but it does not support a 1080p signal. The Samsung website even states that this TV does support 1080p [...] ""The Component input jacks of the 2006 LN-S4095D and the LN-S4695D accept 480i, 480p, 720p, 1080i, and 1080p signals.""The user manual states this TV only supports 720p and 1080i. I have tried multiple 1080p signals on this TV and it DOES NOT support 1080p. I am extremely disappointed by Samsung and false advertising should not be permitted. Amazon should not be listing this as a 1080p TV either."
1,Poor Design,"I have suffered on and off from knee pain when running for a few years now. It seems to act up most when training for marathons. I have tried a few different knee straps to treat the problem - ChoPat, Mueller, etc. This one is the worst. I liked the idea of the V-shaped rubberized brace that can help your knee track more accurately. The problem with this brace is that the strap has no elastic. It is single piece of velcro and has no stretch. Thus it is impossible to put it on correctly. You have to make it either too tight or too loose"
5,keep on walking and playing tennis,A tennis buddy recommended this and it has helped when ever I get my knee inflamed. It allows me to walk and do ballet and just keep moving.
2,not for everyone,My significant other did not like the way this feels at all. Although all of our friends wear these it just wasn't for him. The strap had nothing to do with the feel. He just didn't like the way it sat under his knee. Just be careful when purchasing this product. If your ok with the placement of the support then I would suggest buying it. If you are not comfortable with the idea then do not even bother.
5,Knee saver,Seems to really help my knees. I am 65 years old and play lots of Senior softball and these really seem to help.
3,DISAPPOINTED,"MY SON-IN-LAW THOUGHT I WOULD GET SOME RELIEF WITH THESE UNITS, HOWEVER THEY ONLY ADDED ANOTHER PAIN THAT I HAVE NOT EXPERIENCED BEFORE, AND THAT'S PATELLA PAIN. I WOULD GUESS ONLY ANOTHER OPERATION WILL SOLVE MY PROBLEM....."
1,Kneedit Band,Don't buy it!!! Worked great the 1 week I wore it before the little plastic thing holding the velcro strip broke. I read that had happened to others while reading a couple of the reviews. Wished I would have taken the time to read more of the reviews before purchasing.
4,kneedit knee brace,Product works as advertised. But a bum knee needs more than a brace to feel like a knee that is not damaged.
3,A man shouldn't think about women so often.,"I liked the story of Horndog Blue well enough. And parts of it showed Wintner's usual wit and insight. But I got bothered by a main character who approach to women was so clinical as to suggest gynocological interest. Maybe I'm guilty too and he wanted to touch a nerve. He did. I finished it, and like I say I liked it, but it left me uneasy."
2,Not Complet. Not always The Beach Boys,"A musician capable of plugging in the holes will find this songbook useful, but it will be frustrating as well. It isn't a good research tool. Songs are missing. Sections of songs are missing. Some songs are in the wrong keys. Songs are in the wrong time signature. In one case -- ""Don't Worry Baby"" -- the authors of later discarded lyrics are credited for writing Roger Christian's originals. Those of us who study such things could use a good comprehensive songbook of Brian Wilson's body of work, but also of the key collaborative songs. This aint' it."
2,Limited Information,"This book has limited information. Some of the major river/brooks/ponds/lakes have good info, if your looking to fish smaller waters forget about getting information from this book. Fly selection is just limited to a favorite fly for a region. Limited to no info on hatches. A Delorme Gazatteer will give better information on Locations, and fish species. Many waters are listed in the book but will only a sentence or two of information provided."
4,"Ignore the previous review - ie, USER error","There is NOTHING wrong with this adapter - mine works great. This guy apparently doesn't know a computer from a stick of gum. Windows XP home is no different than WinXP Pro, Win2000, or Win98SE. It is the computer HARDWARE which determines which usb specification the computer is capable of, however most newer computers and usb2.0 cards are compatible with both usb 2.0 and backwards compatible with usb 1.1.Also, there is no such thing as usb version 1.7! Please box up your computer and send it back because you are a moron! j/k... sort of..."
4,great mp3 player,after breakin down and reading the instructions its a great machine !!!!! easy to load and change music ...works well after you figure out the buttons they can be a bit quirky
4,"Read the Manual,it's there for a reason","I just got mine yesterday.I was pretty easy to figure out.Alot of people keep complaining about simple things like having trouble figuring it out or making playlists.To those people I'd like to inform them that there is a manual on the disk it came with,I'm pretty sure your suppose to read it but hey I could be wrong right?lolpros*no itunes*small size*backlight*good sound quality*transfers music fast*doesn't skip*fm radio*voice recorder*great battery lifeCon's*no lanyard*ear buds alittle big"
2,Firmware upgrade solved static? Not quite!,"I downloaded and successfully installed the 1.02 firmware upgrade but it doesn't completely solve the static issue on my player.I don't hear it much with Pop music but it's very noticible with my Classical music mp3s. I can't really enjoy Bach's ""Mass in B minor"" or the Haydn ""Trio Sonatas"" because of it.Not sure if this is because Classical music is recorded at a lower volume level or just has more pauses but you can't miss it in the quieter sections of pieces. After messing with the Equalizer it seems to be minimized with the Jazz setting but it's definitely not gone. Hope they really solve this in a future upgrade.In the meantime, back to the drawing board."
3,Sooo frustrating,"Its small, light, and has great sound but SOOO frustrating. I can't get the play lists to play the way I want. The software is annoying. The drag and drop function does not work so can only load songs through the software. If I could go back I would get a mini Ipod or even a Shuffle."
1,Lasted for about a week,"Nonsensical menu made navigation (it shipped without a manual) next to impossible. It took almost an hour for me to figure out how to enable the shuffle feature. After a few days of use, trying to switch songs would result in the player shutting itself off about half the time. The next day, it happened every time, using fresh batteries. It would also shut off randomly after a song had finished playing, even though it was not at the end of the playlist. Certain songs (which worked on my previous, four-year-old MP3 player) would cause the player to freeze up irrecoverably, forcing removal of the battery to reboot it. Sadly, it stopped working entirely after I threw it against a wall in frustration."
4,Great little MP3 player,"This MP3 player is a great deal. It holds a lot of music (not quite as much as I own, but then again, I own some stuff I don't listen to on a regular basis.) The display is large enough for me to easily see and work with. The controls are simple to get used to. I don't use the arm band thing, though. The neck cord is sufficient since the player is so light."
3,Good MP3 Player,"You get what you pay for. It's a great alternative to an iPod. The sound is just as great, and downloading songs is even easier than iTunes. There is no installing of anything and you can download songs to the MP3 from any computer (unlike the iPod). I found this MP3 player to be extremely easy to use. The only complain I have is with its song searching capabilities. It's just not as easy as the ipod. The battery life is really good. I didn't have to change batteries that often. Overall is a good buy for your money if all you are looking for is an easy, simple MP3 player. Great for young kids..if you don't want to spend the money on an ipod."
4,Nice little MP3 player,"Good things:Nice small size for 1G MP3 player.The MP3 playback sound is great.The voice recorder sounds pretty decent for what it is.Sound level is pretty good for such a small player.Not so good things:I found the controls to be a bit clumsy to use.You have to use a USB cable (one is included), it doesn't plug directly into a USB jack.The included CD > MP3 ripper software is the free version of MusicMatch Jukebox.Hint:Many USB players include MusicMatch software; I downloaded and use CDex instead (it's free)."
5,Cant go wrong with sandisk,"Sandisk makes great durable mp3 players. I work in landscaping and I've dropped mine on cement, in water, dirt, mud and even had it ran over by a bobcat loader. It is still in perfect working order though by now it's a little scratched up. The controls are easy to use and I'm amazed at how finite you can get the volume level to, it is nice to be able to have that much control over the volume."
4,I liked it....,"I got this one as a Christmas gift. It was not my first choice. The sound is clean and clear, you just have to set the equalizer to make it perfect. I have copied several hours of music on mine without issue. MusicMatch Jukebox (default on a Dell) works without complication. Files are easily dragged onto the player as if it was an external drive."
4,Very Pleased!,"This television is not only gorgeous, the picture is outstanding. The picture is extremely sharp, my xbox 360 and PS3 games look incredible. The only reason that I gave this tv 4 stars is because the one con that I did find with it is the sound. The sound quality is not perfect, but is not an issue if you plan on buying speakers. Besides that, I would recommend this tv to any of my friends and family."
5,Satisfied Customer,"I have been very happy with my purchase. I set it up with my stereo (5.1 dolby) for sound and using composite input for video and optical output for audio. Sounds and video is great in HDTV. I have never heard the speakers on the LCD HDTV so I cannot comment on them.Cons: Without HDTV picture is not the best, but in all fairness this is probably true for any LCD TV."
5,Nice Set - Right Price,"Bought this TV after having the Sony 46V2500 at the house for about 2 weeks. Though I got a great deal on that Sony TV as well, I just could not get over the ""clouding"" problems the sony had.The 4095D is a very nice TV for a very reasonable price here at Amazon. The first weekend after receiving it, I was lucky enough to borrow a PS3 to test it out. The images were spectacular! It also does one of the best jobs of any LCD tvs on Standard definition content (Dish network). In fact, I even have one of the inputs over coaxial cable and the TV handles it just fine.This is one of the slimmer tvs out there, so if you have space constraints like a cabinet/recessed wall smaller than 40"" then this is the best fit for it!If you can't fork over the extra cash for the LN-T series (this years' model) or it won't fit in your space.. then this is a great alternative.Also, this was one of my first ""Big"" purchases over the net, and it was a good experience with Amazon."
3,READ THIS BEFORE BUYING! Buy the LNT series instead. This has clouds and flat sound.,"PROS: Wonderful 1080p, and fantastic for playing games on. Love the piano finish.CONS: Sound is VERY flat. Nothing to worry about if you have a receiver. The TV suffers from backlight bleeding in the corners, also known as clouding. It can only be seen when it is very dark scenes or when a full black source. There are a lot of messages about it at the avs forum. It affects both Sony and Samsung for last years August and forward models. But the new LNT* series are amazing! I went to BB yesterday to check them out and the cloud issue is solved and the sound is gorgeous. LNT4061F has a matte finish. The 65 and 66 have a semi-gloss.Samsung LNT4061F 40"" 1080p LCD HDTV"
4,Great TV,Finally Upgraded to HD and wanted to future proof with 2 HDMI inputs and 1080p. Great picture and watching normal TV is a downer now. We were looking at the 4096d but couldn't find any differences except for the HD Cable Card which we would never use (no PPVs or DVR with Cable Card).Only other downer is the black/gray levels which we knew going in with the LCD.
1,A Certainly-Not-Ian-McEwan Book,"After reading a series of well-developed and complex novels by Ian McEwan, my standards are higher. This one didn't measure up."
3,Needs some tweeking,"I had something similar and lost it in a move (where do those things go?).I ordered this assuming it was basically the same thing. It is, with two glarring exceptions. One, the cups are abviously made to hole ""small"" eggs. I prefer to use Large eggs and they spill over from these cups into your boiling water. It's messy! Two, the little slots made to pick the pan up out of the boiling water with a fork are a great idea, however, they're not wide enough for a standard sized fork. I think I'll be dumping this one and buying another...live and learn."
2,Out of luck?,"It came in brand new from the box. But does not work at all.I have never run into this for a brand new PC. The power lights are on and fans are spinning. Even the HD light is on. But the mouse light is off, no keyboard response, no show no monitor at all. Not even a BIOS check beep upon power on. Am I out of luck or some serious design flaw or QC control from HP?It packs with a lot of attractive goodies though."
4,"If you have to choose, you should select ""In Over Our Heads""","I happened to read Kegan's, ""In Over Our Heads: The Mental Demands of Modern Life,"" prior to reading ""The Evolving Self."" While both books were very good, I don't think I gleaned a whole lot of additional insight from ""The Evolving Self."" So, if you are busy and can only afford to read one or the other of these two books by Kegan, I recommend you select ""In Over Our Heads."""
1,Heart Sensor Doesn't Get Picked Up,"What a disappointment. I had the previous model of this Timex and it worked great, until I broke it on accident. I thought this would be better because it's a newer model. I disregarded the previous reviews and thought they must have gotten the bad batches. I tried it once I got it, and I couldn't get a heart beat for the whole entire time I worked out. 45-minutes of cardio is long enough to get some kind of reading. I lost my trust on Timex that day. Good thing I tested it right away, I was able to return it to Amazon, with no problems."
2,Wireless Issue,"This Dance Pad is so nice, sensitive and accurate. You will never miss a step during play time. I have only one problem with wireless, i bought to of them since it uses a infrared and uses them together you will have a problem coz whoever step first will get the button if you're late thats it your out! You'll feel it didn't work well together. It's better only 1 player not 2."
1,Big disappointment,"The color combinations look good in the book, but bear no relationship to the colors you get on the web. The printed colors are sometimes wildly different than the on-screen colors they are meant to represent. It was a waste of time and money."
3,"A good resource, even with the problems","This book is a wonderful resource that is deserving of 5 stars if it wasn't for the printing issues and wrong hex colors. Some colors you pick will come out completely different on screen and 10 or 20 hex colors are misnumbered.Don't let this scare you away though. It is not difficult to match the correct colors in Photoshop using it's built-in color picker and the publishers have put up a a page on their site with corrections to the wrong hex numbers.Overall, a great resource, but you may want to look into the Color Harmony Workbook, printed by the same publisher, as well."
2,Poor Choice,Bought this based on price and got what I paid for. Cheaply made and does not work well. Soon after submerging it it comes back to the surface. Used the float option which is also sub par. It also leaks and has humidity on the inside which obscures the numbers. Overall a poor product.
4,Nice Video...,The video is well done. It shows a glimpse behind the curtain of the toy industry. I would like to have seen more but maybe that is just me. It is family friendly but kids today may not know of many of the classic toys revealed in the video.I enjoyed it. I simply wanted to see more of the behind the scenes at the corporate level. Most of the eye-view was that of the inventor and designer. I know what that looks like. I wanted to see how the companies act behind those shiny closed doors in the ivory towers. I guess that is for a different documentary.Am I glad I bought it? Yes.Am I glad I watched it? Yes.Would I watch it a second time? No need to.perrytheinventor.com
4,It's getting a little chilly in here.,"I've owned a dozen or more versions of Oedipus Rex over the years, and this one still remains on my shelf. I like Salonen's Stravinsky in general. It follows th composer's preference for chilly, precise, detached articulaiton without sentiment. But in this cast the Oedipus, Vinson Cole, sounds overparted, as does the excellent mezzo, Anne Sofie von Otter. Vocally, the parts of Oedipus and Jocasta are as weighty and florid as anything in early Verdi, and here we have lighter voices trying to carry the dramatic thrust but sounding like fairly polite oratorio singers. I imagine that's deliberate, and the result overall is very musical But for me there has to be more fire in the mix, at least as much opera as oratorio."
4,a most sinister gift.,"Diaghilev was correct when called this 1927 work by Igor Stravinsky, ""a most sinister gift."" Everything about it seems wrong: timing; libretto; translation; narration; staging; Italianate vocalisms; the ominous tympani rolls. Its one standout virtue is its simplicity. For those reasons - & more - Oedipus Rex is really an ironic comedy about Stravinsky himself, & quite Mozartian if one is willing to make a character of the composer & laugh at his pretensions as Mozart laughed & as Stravinsky so rarely did.Bob Rixon"
3,"It is not 8 ft., it is 7 ft.","To start, this was misrepresented at being 8ft. Actually it is 7ft. Not that big of a deal. What is a big deal is that after using this product the first time, the cord does not fully retract. It almot fully retracts but leave about 6 inches of cord dangling - not good."
2,Great idea but still far away from a perfect BT headset,"I bought the BT200 after doing some research over the net and generally it has a good rating, now it is my turn to write my experience.Pros: great idea, comfortable on the ear, good price, voice dilaing if your phone support it, stylish, convenience, safer driving, volume button, easy to pair with your phone.Cons: still far away from a perfect BT headset because of:really short range I am talking less than 9 feet before the conversation gets really uncomfortable for both sides, a lot of interference. basicly you need to keep your phone in your pocket. Not small in size, I give the quality of the sound comparing to my phone 2/5. if you are not in a really quite place forget about the voice dialing and the clarity of the conversation bottoms to the ground.I am still waiting for the perfect BT headset but I am not sure if they will come up with one soon."
1,"Cell Deal Good, Order Accessories Elsewhere","My order included both a Nokia 3650 and a Jabra BT200. Amazon sent me the old non-compatible version of the BT200, now I have to RMA it back to Jabra, at my expense. Poor service on Amazon's part, even tho it was listed as a compatible accessory to the Nokia!"
1,Jabra does not take it back now!,I called Jabra today and they refused to take the incompatible version back. I'll need to refund it myself.
3,"Great idea, could be better","First off, the headset is only $20 if purchased with a Sony Ericsson T610. For that much, this is a must buy.The concept is wonderful, and it works well for the most part. I can speak wirelessly with my phone elsewhere. The headset itself is comfortable - especially the eargel. It fits snugly and sound is clear.Two gripes, however:1) Battery life is less than impressive. Jabra claims 3 hrs. I have yet to get beyond 2. In fact, last night when I used it, I got a warning signal at exactly 1:51.2) Bluetooth range is 30 feet only when in a clear path. My bathroom is 15 feet away. I get noticeable static on my end. If I close the door, everything becomes unintelligble. The interesting thing is that the person on the other end doesn't seem to notice a thing.All in all, it's a great concept and works well aside from the two gripes listed above. I recommend it."
4,Does Work with the nokia 3650 great!!!,I have the jabra freespeak bluetooth at first i tryed to connect the headset but it would not connect. So i called jabra corp and they did say it was a problem and that they did fix the problem by having me ship my head set back and they sent me the new verision it works fine now no 10 wait.
2,Convenient and comfortable but bad sound quality,This is a convenient product but I wish it had better noise cancelling. The people to whom I talk complain that they hear much of the road noise in my car. My other (wired) headsets work much better.On the good side...this is the most comfortable headset ever.
1,make sure you get the box with the 3650/S55 sticker,"Even though this phone is specifically listed as working with the 3650, Amazon sent me the wrong box (without the sticker) and the unit doesn't work with my phone. I went to my local AT&T wireless store and picked up one that works fine."
2,Not worth it,"This product is not worth the money, you are better off with the headset that came with your phone. It works great if you are using the headset in the bathroom where there are no electronic devices around. And the max distance between phone and headset is probably 4ft. For example if the phone is in your pant's pocket the reception is terrible, you have to hold the phone in your hand then what's the point of having a wireless headset. Anywhere around the living room with the TV on, you hear static. BTW I have a Sony Ericson T68i."
2,The commercial-pop side of Wetton,"This anthology is the pop, commercial, ballad type. I do not like this sugary side of wetton. There is another compilation which is 10 times better: 'King's Road', that includes progressive music from his era with K Crimson, UK, and some solo songs. This one is really a great intro to the 70's great wetton."
5,Psarantonis.. a world phenomenon,"""Psarantonis represents the higher gate of the Orphic secret scale, despite the fact that, according to all meaningless and insignificant modern ""lyrical poets"" whose labour is centred on the trivial and superficial embellishment of a cheap reproduction of the past, his scale is rather limited. Psarantonis' superb poetic value will henceforth deprive them of any chance of survival for the sake of posterity"" by Yiannis Spyropoulos. ""Once you meet a cretan lad you're overwhelmed by joy,lass, you wish it not and yet you smile without knowing why"". MY gongratulations to Amazon.com for adding this superb record in the lists...And my gontratulation to who ever buy this one and others records of Psarantonis... And I suggest to all to come and visit Crete to saw him performing live in Crete Island, its fantastic"
5,Hard to Find and Worth it!!!,"FAst, timely, exactly what i wanted and as described. Great addition to my collection. Thanks!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!"
2,Worked great for a month...,"This product worked great...until I changed the battery. After I put a new battery in, the player would barely even come back on. It does this EVERY time I change that battery. I put a new battery in it yesterday and of course it didn't come on right away but after trying and trying to make it work, it still won't come on. I will not buy another sandisk mp3."
5,AWESOME BUY!!!!,This is a great little MP3 player. The joystick makes it easy to get to any song. For the money it is a great first MP3 player.P.S. It DOES NOT freeze! Some people said it did...
2,"decent device, horrible service","After only six hours the earphones stopped working. Serveral days of emailing tech support later, SanDisk refuses to send a replacemnet. The display screen is also slow to display. It has no alternative means of power (like an AC adaptor). The radio receiver is a nice addition. The included arm strap is fairly useless."
3,Not bad for a first MP3 player,"The size is great, it's about the size of a cigarette lighter. This player is pretty easy to use, though to set up right hand or left hand us, it helps to read the manual.The big drawback (maybe it's just mine) is that it freezes. I have to take the battery out and put it back in just to turn it off. But once it freezes I have to format the player and re-sync all the music. Sometimes it happens out of nowhere when it is changing songs, other times it freezes from the time that I've loaded new songs on. I was told to download a patch and upload that onto the player, however that doesn't fix it AND it takes up MB. But all in all this happens maybe 2 times a month.If I can find another player at the same price I'll get a new one."
2,Unit freezes after one song..... Nice radio though-----,"I received this unit last week and I havent listend to more than one song, the unit freezes and the battery has to be replaced to get it working again. I contacted sandisk technical support and after trying everything they say the unit has to be replaced.The only reason I gave it a 2 star is because the tech support is very effective. After I receive the new unit its going to ebay.Look for Lexar, they has a better MP3 player."
2,not that wow,when i got this mp3 i enjoyed it for a while. then while in the plastic wrap it dropped and the screen cracked. after a while when u play the song all u hear is static. at first i thought it was the headphone but after purchasing a lot of head phones i came to the conclusion that my mp3 was bad. i gave it out and now i am here shopping for a new one.
4,Great little player,"Tiny, light and works as advertised.I originally bought this to play birdsongs and animal calls through external speakers (it will hold about three CDs worth of material), but now I wear it every day at work to listen to the radio.It is easy to use and sounds good, big screen for its size, my only complaint is the battery life - I get less than half the advertised life when using the radio. Time to invest in rechargables!Steve"
4,Solid cheap media player,"I was very happy to open the package and find this media player to be about the size and shape of a cigarette lighter. I was looking for something for use at the gym so I didn't have to listen to 24 Hour Fitness' terrible piped in tunes. This player is the perfect size to put on your arm with the comfortable included strap and forget it is there. In the real world it holds about 90 to 100 songs comfortably, but more than that and the menu gets a little slow. I like the player very much, but have one reservation- the included headphones are absolute crap. Replace them with a decent set and be happy, otherwise you have to walk around holding them in your ears, and they sound pretty muddy."
1,Worst MP3 Player it is JUNK!!,This is a very difficult item to use and it breaks down! DO NOT WASTE YOUR MONEY!!It is a good thing this thing is no longer available as it shows it is junk. Not even SanDisk has replacements!
5,A Wonderful Biography,"I just finished reading ""Isaiah Berlin"" and must say that it is one of the finest books I have ever read. The story of Mr. Berlin's life is fascinating, from his childhood in Russia and England, to his education, his service in the Foreign Office during WWII, his meetings with Boris Pasternak and Anna Akhmatova, his career as an Oxford don, etc. Mr. Ignatieff tells the story, interspersed with the substance of his developing philosophical views, with warmth and insight. Even if you care not for philosophy (and I generally do not), this book deserves attention simply because it is a wonderful life and well told."
5,An excepcional book,"Few biographies turn out to be such good books: Ignatieff's empathy for its subject mirrors Berlin's ability to understand/feel, and explains the glow that remains when you finally put the book down; in that sense it is a very unusual biography, fitting a most unusual man. Objectivity and love make a fair, warm testemony that does not cut intellectual corners. Berlin was lucky with his biographer, but then he always was.One criticism: I think it's the first chapter(""Albany""), not the last, that should have closed the book - it is there that Ignatieff gives a clearer feeling of who I.Berlin was. I went back to the begining and repeated that first chapter, and only then did the book seem complete."
3,Re: the first Brady Kenton & Alex Gunnison tale,"Just finished this book a day or so ago.Frankly, it's well done, but I think this author has done better work before.Especially try, by this writer:Outlaw TrainMr. LittlejohnCherokee JoeThe Genesis RiderAny of these stories shows Judd's talent as a writer much better than ""Leadville"""
1,dont last long,"After a few minutes of use the disc that is holding the wires will spin on the shaft, so no power gets transmitted to the brush to make it spin once a load is applied to it. This has happened to everyone that I have tried to use so far, that's about 6 of them."
5,Great Movie!,Great actingGood storyWorth watchingI watched intently throughout the movie. I wish they would make more movies like this one.
4,Great spy book with a nice sci-fi twist,"I picked this book up in a used bookstore as I am a fan of Haldeman's Forever books and enjoyed it immensley. The premise is a basic spy story, a KGB spy placed in America and awaiting activation who happens to end up being a sort of double agent with the CIA. Basic spy stuff and while interesting, it is nothing spectacular.Oh, I forgot to mention this spy in question has invented a device (a watch) that can control people's minds, hypnotize them in a sense. Which mixed in with a spy book makes a great read. If you see this book in a used store or if hopefully it gets reprinted, grab it!"
3,Everything you ever wanted to know about CB Irwin (and more),"This is an incredibily thorough, detailed book about the life of CB Irwin. Anna Lee Waldo has done an incredible job researching the subject. The book gives a wonderful insight into what life was like for farmers and ranchers in Kansas, Colorado and Wyoming during 1870-1930. As this is a true story, it is often lacking the exciting plot twists that you would have in a novel."
5,Thank you!,My boy friend loved them they are a little to small for his 2012 dodge Ram truck but he still is using them even though they are a little small would probably fit a smaller size head rest still thank you.
5,"Captivé, fasciné, subjugué","Godard est peut-tre le seul réalisateur à ne pas avoir eu peur du mythe BB. Le résultat est magnifique : la présence de Bardot, la musique de Delerue, la villa de Malaparte à Capri, le tout réuni avec maestria par Godard adaptant Moravia font de ce film magique un sortilège de séduction irresistible."
2,not good,"i love great movies. i didn't understand this movie at all. it seemed very indulgent and lacked passion and meaning. it lacked heart and soul. i have seen several french films and they all seem to disappoint in some ways. they share a warped sense of love, relationships and romance that i find wierd and uninteresting. perhaps a better background in the Odyssey and Homer's work is required as it was alluded to throughout the film. don't waste your time with this flick. see something else."
2,Misfire on Blu-Ray,"This is,without a doubt, one of the best films ever made by Godard and his cinematographer, Raoul Coutard.The Criterion Collection transfer is impeccable - sharp focus, well-balanced primary colors, great sound.The Blue-ray disc (not from Criterion but Lionsgate's Studio Canal label) is a major disappointment on just about every level - especially with the color levels. There appears to be a yellowish cast to everything. No hard reds, blues, yellows or greens.Skin tones are dull and gray. It seems to have been made from completely different elements, with no reference to the original intent, or even the Coutard approved transfer.At least it was not panned and scanned, about the only thing in it's favor.If you have the Criterion version already - keep it.The ""up grade"" to Blu-Ray is NOT an improvement."
3,Not what I expected,"I found this book to be very well written and easy to read. It provided a lot of insight into what you should consider when writing an instructional manual or book.However, the reason I purchased the book was to study up on technical writing in order to take the Technical Writing Dante test. After I finished reading the book, I looked at the sample questions and found that not one of them had been addressed."
4,"New Wave Dance Hits: Just Can't Get Enough, Vol. 1...",Cruel to be Kind - Nick Lowe - that was my song at the time. New Wave was alive and well in 1981. Four stars overall!
3,"Cool for the price, but it IS cheap","Fun and easy to build, but it's pretty fragile. The traces will pop off on you pretty easily. They are really more of a sticker with foil than traces, so be careful.It does work, but it's mot particularly audiophile or anything.Can't beat it for the price, though."
4,My 1st introduction to Bobby McFerrin (3.5-4 stars),"I think I kinda heard this back in elementary school (maybe like in the 2nd, 3rd, 4th grade or so, I get kinda mixed when I say that), it's like sumthin I never heard be4, A guy who sings, scats and does it all goes by the name Bobby McFerrin and a cellist by the name of Yo Yo Ma. I'd have follow thru his work as a cellist/string player from various TV apperances, shows, movies, etc. and he does sounds good 2 this day, believe me.Anyway as I was gonna say this was the 1st album I got introduced a bit by Bobby McFerrin. Not SIMPLE PLEASURES nor SPONTANEOUS INVENTIONS. Just this 1. I hope to hear more from him and collect all of his albums incl. Yo Yo Ma's. They still sound good. No doubt."
1,Prostalex Plus,"Has not really helped with frequency of urination. Wouldn't recommend it.The best bet is Flomaxx, or a similar product."
4,"awkward door, but otherwise good","this playpen is way to give your animal some play space outside the cage. i've got two attached to one another so that my rabbit has room to run and get her freak on. the pen is fairly sturdy. the rabbit chews on it and flings herself against the side of it, and it remains standing. i've attached the pen directly to her cage, which is also made by ware, so it fits well. while would never trust the security of this attachment without the separate carabiner clips i bought at the hardware store, it is very secure now that i've added them. it's pretty easy to remove panels from the pen if you want to customize your configuration.the door of the pen seems odd, but since i don't use, it's not an issue for me."
1,Wheels Fall Off During Use,I returned this product to the store I bought it from. The bucket cannot handle the weight of the water when it is filled up. Wheels fall off one by one. I recommend spending more and getting the Rubbermaid Wavebrake. I am very pleased with it's durability and that it is commercial grade.
2,mopbucket,This mop bucket was to flimsy. I gave away to my daughter and she said the same thing. Rubbermaid product are the best. So from now on I will buy rubbermaid.
1,Very disappointed!,"DON'T BUY IT!! We ordered this bucket for our daycare center and paid for it with fundraising money. I put it together on a Friday afternoon to start using it on Monday. The first time the teachers filled it and rolled it across the floor the wheels fell off! The second time they used the wringer for the mop, it fell apart! After numerous times of trying to put it back together, it just keeps falling apart! What a waste of our fundraising money!"
3,Easy glide mop bucket,This product is not what I quite expected. It does the job though. For what it cost I thought it would be sturdier. Will see how it does as we go along and get used to using it.
4,Netter's Interactive Atlas,"The setup and layout of the atlas is fairly intuitive and easy to maneuver.One beneficial aspect of the atlas was that one can bookmark certain slides and labels to return to and study further. However, it would have been helpful if the layers of muscle were somehow illustrated or assembled such that each successive layer could be examined or studied."
5,The REAL THING !,"From the samples this sounds like an excellent disk. Too expensive, I think, but still - these are original recordings of the music; sometimes it's only the end-credit cuts rather than the intro's, but the content is much, MUCH better than a soft sad muzak-style reprise on some synthesizer or something - here you get the vital old TV Western themes in their all glory.A proof of its value, perhaps, is that they can charge so darned much."
3,Switchin' To Glide Ripoff,"Swichin' To Glide is only the 2nd half of the Beat Goes On / Switchin' To Glide combo. In other words, it seems to start in the middle of the song. Kings fans be warned."
1,Hood latch,You get what you pay for very cheap metal made in taiwan. Feels like they just bent sheetmetal for the latches a week later rust was showing.
1,You only pay for the brand,"I thought this Compaq was going to be a reliable PC, I was wrong, it doesn't have reset button and I had to call a technician due that it always frozen and I've lost a lot of works because of this. I don't recommend this computer to anybody."
1,description of item changes in cart...,I really wanted to get my fiance this sweatshirt. I ordered the pullover Carhartt like it says in the description. When you add it to the cart it automatically changes to a zip front - which he hates. I had to cancel the order once I realized it was a zip. I tried it again and it still changed the description. This is the first problem I have ever had with Amazon. Now I have to order this from somewhere else and I don't want to...urgh
5,Don't listen to the other fashion reviews,"This is not your ordinary hoodie. It does NOT fall apart within 6 months. I have had one now for 2+years and despite paint and other stains, it is in excellent condition and i continue to wear it to this day. Carhart sells from what i can tell, two types of hoodies. One is the heavy weight, insulated and this is not it. This is a lighter weight and is ideal for layering. I have 3 now."
2,its not a pullover,"I needed a hooded sweatshirt i hate the zippered ones so i look for the pull overs. so i search ""pullover"" well a picture of a pullover came up so i went to checkout. when i hit the order button somehow it automatically changes it to ""zippered"" so i tried it a few more times with the same result, it kept changing on me. so i called amazon and told them about the old switcharoo. the guy on the phone told me that he sees the problem and doesnt know why its doing it but he kept reassuring me that when it was shipped that it would have no zipper!!! well i got it and it has a damn zipper!!! i needed exactly what i orderd for an event. when i got it thought i couldnt even use it! im done with amazon!!!! p.s. the customer service people are hard to understand, maybe amazon should use an american based service line!!!"
3,meh,"It's an ok sweatshirt, nothing special tho. Figured carhartt would be better material. Kinda short as tallness goes. I'll wear it tho, gunna put some patched onto it."
4,Helps when spelling gets dry,This book is a great help when you can't think of any ways to make spelling enjoyable. This book has a ton of great games and fun strategies for learning weekly spelling words.
3,Good ideas but not practical.,"What I mean by saying this book isn't practical involves the time spent copying, preparing and implementing the games in the classroom. Most spelling curriculum includes practice worksheets. There isn't enough hours in the day to add another activity. Perhaps parents would use this book but I doubt it. The games are fun and helpful but it didn't work for me as a teacher."
5,Debussy says,"""It is my love for music that drives me to liberate it from certain sterile and restrictive traditions.It is a free, open-air art, a bubblingg spring, elemental like the wind, the sky or the sea.It must not become closed and academic"" One of the things I miss most about music today is a primal element, a visceral approach. You can fell it in this excellent record."
4,Excellent interpretation but dull program,"For one who wants to discover Debussy's piano music, this is an excellent buy. However, Entremont's program is one of regularly played pieces: the images, suite bergamasque, etc. I was hoping to find some of the more obscure pieces as I am used from such a good performer as Entremont. All in all a very good buy."
2,Not so useful....,"This is really a source book lacking in new and useful information. It concentrates on who would bond familiar of type X (animals, outer planar creatures, undead, snakes, vermin, etc) and expanded lists of those creatures. I personally think it have been much more useful as a source book for the familiar it self; IE creature ""motivation"" for accepting the bond, feats for them, and maybe even ""personality"" traits. After all, if you use the basic familiars and those available from Improved Familiar feat as a guide you can easily replace most of this book with a 10 minute conversation with your DM. Sure this list of extra creatures is nice, hence the 2nd star, but a great deal of this type of information could be reasoned out on your own."
5,Diamantine Aranjuez `s Concert !,"This celebrated and so may times listened Concert has seen many performances of all kind of conceptions. Even there is a curious transcription for harp by Nicanor Zabaleta, not available in CD format.In this case we have a warm performance. John Williams in the peak of his powers performs to date the most successful and expressive Aranjuez that I have listened ever. Ormandy shines too throughout his accompaniment with the glorious strings sections of the Philadelphia.Fantasía para un gentil hombre finds in Williams an acceptable reading, but the full acknowledgement goes to Andres Segovia. who recorded an unsurpassable recording in the late fifties.Giuliani Op. 30 is a lovely piece as well the famous Vivaldi 's Concert, altough I felt this last work with extremely fast tempo.A golden recording for your collection."
5,Wonderful Saw,To me this is the king of miter saws. Amazon had the best price on it that I could find anywhere online. I got it for $100.00 less than I could have gotten it locally. The unit works great. It is dead on on cuts. I was also very pleased with the fast truly free shipping from Amazon.
4,Great entry in the Dover Coloring Book series!,"This Dover Coloring Book of selected famous Frank Lloyd Wright stained glass window designs is very well done. Each design is is clearly executed on translucent plastic, suitable for hand coloring. Each of the 16 designs are attributed to the place they came from, and there are illustrations of 4 of the original windows provided. Definitely worth the few bucks to own this wonderful book!"
4,Frank Lloyd Wright Stained Glass Designs,"If you're a fan of Frank Lloyd Wright architecture and art, or if you like stained glass art, this coloring book can inspire your own designs. A few hours with a copy machine and some colored pencils can produce personally customized drawings for use in your own home. I recommend this book to the designers, and budding graphic artists in the crowd."
1,Renegade-Very Disappointed,"After reading Lawman, I deceided to to buy other books by Diana Palmer. I found at least ten books so far that I like. Some times I read them at leat three times,before I start another book. When I read Renegade, I were very diappointed. I did not like Tippy in Lawless. Then she brought Tippy back with Cash in Renegade and I really hated that. I wish she would have found another female love interest for Cash."
3,Wish it would have been stronger,"There was SO MANY avenues that this story could have taken and been so much better! Cash needed a more fleshed out military history and then a usage of his history. REALLY disappointed in his character usage. Have worked for a movie studio as a stunt woman, so am familiar with how things work there and Tippy would NOT have been used for the stunt! Needed a different premise and more investigation into how the the stunt world works."
4,Renegade by Diana Palmer,Love anything that this author writes. Great stories blending the old with the new and the continuation of characters in the series.
3,Art Doesn't Always Imitate Life,"I have seen this choir in concert and find the video a pale imitation of the former. The choice of music doesn't match up to the powerful ensemble of voice; the lighting and camera work aren't of the highest quality, which is also a let down. This is a shame, as the choir themselves are exceptionally brilliant. If you get a chance to see them on stage, you will easily see what I mean.The video is worth the purchase to get a good idea of how well they are choreographed and work together, especially when you consider they only practice as a group twice a month.There are a few songs which will inspire, but apart from that, it is a disappointment. The CD I have is far superior to this.I hope that if Cantorion Colin Jones decides to make another video - and they should - they will select musical pieces appropriate for a male voice choir of their calibre, and that it's presentation will be better."
5,We're all hoping for change,"Playing for Change is the best concept in music yet. The album (especially the DVD version) captures the essence of what the whole ""Playing for Change"" movement is all about -- fostering world peace through music. The performers, all joining in a series of overdubs of the same songs, show that musical harmony can bring about cross-cultural harmony, and Grandpa Elliot epitomizes the powerful change music can provide in a single life. While he was a street performer,he was picked up by the producer and included as a featured performer in the band. The production in this album is really smooth and the selection of music is right on target. Get this album and support this worthwhile cause that has already built a school of music in one of the African villages that appear in the album."
4,Better than the original by far,"I only paid $4 for the original and i liked it, sort of. i really couldn't get into Lee's voice, i'm sure he's great vocalist for the type of music he does but it just didn't mesh well with this album. I always thought, it would sound cool if Dave would sing it and well isn't great that he did. Although i kind of don't buy the whole ""the vocal tapes got lost"" thing. I really love Hell's Motel and The Creed the most now, yeah there are songs with some lame lyrics but i still think it's pretty good. The change in vocals really did a lot for the improvement of this album so i give it 4 stars."
3,Better ?,The music sounds great like on the first one all the instruments sound realy solid and Dave sounds alot better than the other dude but I thought he was ok. But man come on these lyrics are so cheesy that it hurts.Alot of the riffs are pretty good but some sound very familiar. The extra tracks are worth the money alone.
2,what a difference,"I had the original version on cassette for several years, and I really enjoyed Lee Ving's limited vocal abilities on these songs...then I found the remastered version on CD, without knowing Dave Mustaine had rerecorded the vocals, and I almost returned to the used CD store which I bought it from before I even got home just to get my money back! You don't know how much of a shock it was to hear that Muppet with his jaw wired shut ""singing"" these songs; I forced myself to listen to the whole thing before I made up my mind, and it only convinced me to search out the original version on CD to replace the tape I had..."
5,Great book,"A masterful overview of the process of building your own house that makes it seem both straightforward and eminently doable. David Cook's personal experiences at saving a great deal of money make any canny reader want to go and do likewise.The hard work needed is not ignored. If you don't want to, David Cook says you can still build your own house without lifting even a hammer. But most of his readers will be eager to wield the hammer, the nail gun and especially the backhoe.If this book jumps off the shelf at you when you see it; or you laugh out loud or give an involuntary shout for joy, maybe you need to build a house, aided by Mr. Cook's excellent advice."
3,"light on details, heavy on ideas","If you happen to be a rather wealthy and apparently successful professional who can take a summer or two off to build your house, here's the book for you. A fairly well written account, finances are never actually mentioned other than purchase prices.I doubt you'll build a house with this book, but if you're already started on that path a few of the ideas listed may help shave substantial amounts off your final cost."
4,The Great One Rides again,"This will be a hit for anyone who has fond memories of the 60's and Jackie Gleason's classic visual comedy.We loved the chance to relive the 60's fashion, hairstyles, cars and dialogue in a fun way.Think Ralph Kramden and family as tourists in eastern Europe during the cold war.The screenplay is based on a Woody Allen stage production and is witty without being too introspective.Loved it!"
3,Cute Bike But High Seat A Problem,"Looking for a 2nd Tricycle for my 2 yr. old daughter's daycare, we went to TRU last evening to take a look. She absolutely loved the look of this one, but unfortunately could not swing her leg over the seat to get on and off easily. We have a 10"" Radio Flyer Classic at home that she has no problem with and rides all over the place (we love it). Also, while riding in the store the handlebar bumped against something and tipped right over (as almost all do). I was also concerned with the plastic compartment on the back as my crazy girl would be standing on it (I'm sure)and could break it or hurt herself.After checking all of them out I decided to go with the Kiddi-o Simba ST1 for only $29.99, didn't want to spend to much since this will be an extra bike. Just called the store, they had one left and it's assembled and waiting for me. Hopefully it will be worth all the research."
4,Great Tricycle,We bought this Fold-N-Go Tricycle for our 22 month old son and he really loves it. He doesn't know how to pedal it yet but his so thrilled with it and we figured he will learn how to pedal it. It's a great tricycle and safe just don't forget to buy the helmet and elbow and knee pads.
2,Super cute trike if no one is riding it.,"I orginally bought this trike when my daughter was 18 months old. At the time she was still too small to really use it, so she pushed it with her feet. It's an adorable product, small, folds up (great to take on trips to grandma's) but it isn't so cute when your kids sails over the front of the handle bars. Now that our daughter is almost 3 and is actually much more in to riding this trike we are getting rid of it. It just tips way too much, to the side, to the front, to the other side. I just ordered the new Schwinn Roadster Trike to replace this one. Now that she wants to ride, I want to get something that is safer and easier. For some reason it also seems a little hard to petal...the tires (which are hard plastic) sometimes just spin and don't go anywhere."
1,Tip hazard,"We purchased this tricycle for our 24 month old son. As soon as he would shift his weight away from the seat and turn the wheel, the tricycle became very unstable and tip. I thought the main idea behind having three wheels was stability. This bike is a hazard.I am returning the tricycle immediately. I do not recommend this product."
3,So-So Trike,"I bought this tricycle eventhough I read the mixed reviews. The positives: Good price, good brand name, looks adorable, folds and hangs for easy storage. The negatives: It says it's for 18 months+, but my 2 yo twins are having problems with it tipping over and haven't figured out the whole peddling thing yet.Overall, it's just okay and didn't break the bank."
1,Unsteady trike,"My twins have had these since they were 2, and they've never been a good fit. These tricycles are very unsteady and tip over constantly. It's like they are too top-heavy... the wheels should have been designed further apart from each other to provide a more stable base. I can tell my sons don't feel comfortable riding them, so they always opt for their Radio Flyer Scoot-Abouts instead."
1,tippy,"I am so very surprised by the difference in opinion on this bike.Overall: My (just turned) two year old tips this bike constantly. She likes it. (except when it tips) She wants to be a big girl like her sisters and ride her bike, but it discourages her when it tips. It is cute. Nice little bucket....but bottom line is I am trying to find a bike that doesn't tip as easily."
5,GREAT LITTLE BIKE AND COMPACT FOLDABLE.,"We use this bike when the little one has to go watch an older sibling at soccer practice or a game. The little one could ride this one around and not be bored. The great thing about this bike is that it is foldable so it fits in the car easily. We've used it for 2 years and it's still in great condition. Now, the little one has outgrown this one...I wish they made a bigger one, too. Or, a bigger bike that is foldable."
2,High center of gravity!,Works ok if riding straight on smooth flat ground. Easily tips with turns and uneven ground. Would not recommend. Very disappointing.
3,Try it out in the store FIRST!!,"This trike was one of the top choices for a Christmas gift for my 27 month old son. The ages say 18 months -4 years, but there is no way is that possible. My son is 36inches tall and too big for this trike. When he tried to get on the trike holding on to the handle bars, it tipped over. I thought he did something wrong, so i placed him on the bike, then he tried to push forward on the handles bars to get his feet to go and the trike tipped again. I would most definitely try it out. I did put my son on the bigger version of this Trike , the fold n go XL, but he was too short to reach the pedals, but atleast if offers more room for growth."
5,From the old guard to the golden age,"Harlequin's release of ""Roberto Firpo 1920-1944"" is a rare oportunity to hear both acoustic and electric recordings of Don Roberto Firpo, tango maestro, a forming figure of the argentinian tango. The tracks on this release, taken from original 78 RPM records, bring both the taste of the old guard of tango - listen to Rosendo Mendizabal's ""El entrerriano"" or to a master rendition of Angel Villoldo's ""El choclo"" and of course, of the golden age - as in Blomberg and Maciel's ""Violines Gitanos"", also a big hit for Ignacio Corsini. Today, seventy or eighty years after they were recorded, the 23 tracks in this CD are an insight into one of the father figures of the eternal tango. Wether you love tango, or are ready to give a chance to some music from the heart - let the music of Firpo take you to old time Buenos Aires, to the era of guapos and victrolas, to Hotel Victoria and the Hansen's and you'll see why tango is called ""a feeling to dance to""."
2,"Feels cheap, wouldn't turn on","I happened to get this model as a great deal, however, when I brought it home it wouldn't power on, even after trying my own battery that I knew worked. I ended up sending it back, but while I had it I noted that it had a single sheet of documentation, a cheap battery, and the unit itself felt like the plastic was too light, the buttons too flimsy. Instead of getting a replacement, I ""upgraded"" and got an iRiver unit instead, and after examination found it to be much better made, with much better doc. It cost me 50% more than this Sandisk player, but I guess sometimes you get what you pay for."
1,Do Not Waste your money,"I purchased this MP3 player instead of an IPod and I really regret it. The buttons on it are very hard to press and they usually do not even work. It will get stuck on the radio and unable to switch back to the MP3's. Or, it will start scanning the radio for stations and you won't be able to stop. I highly recommend spending the extra $100 for an IPod"
2,worked well for about four weeks,"I got this for Christmas from my kids. I loved it the first few weeks. I use it while running. After four weeks, the player shorts out, then resets itself and shorts out again. I've tried changing batteries and head sets, but this is obviously not the problem. I'm very disappointed, yet afraid to let my kids know it's not working properly since they just bought it for me six weeks ago. Prior to this problem commencing, it would lock up and I would have to uninstall the battery and reinstall it to get it to turn on. Buy the dell dj ditty instead, or an iriver or ipod nano. My husband got the ditty and my kids the nano's they work great. More money, but mine is now basically worthless after just six weeks."
5,this thing is AWESOME!!,"The first one I ordered for my 10 year old son had an issue with the FM tuner, but the replacement one works really well. He has had it for 2 weeks now, he uses it every day and is still on the original battery. The sound quality is very good. Once you get the hang of it, it is very easy to use. I would highly recommend this item."
4,Perfect choice if your concern is quick and easy music,"This mp3 player is very easy to use and handy, in contrast with other reviews. It is fully customizable and well designed. However, the sound quality is far below the i-pods. The armband is very useful and very durable. I have been using this player for almost 6 months and expreinced only a few problems which are actually very easy to figure out and solve. The only problem is the firmware the earphones coming with the player. you may need to buy another one because it is totally useless, very very uncomfortable. However, It is a nice, fancy and durable stuff. perfect for runners."
1,It may be good if it works.,"Got this one as a birthday present. Looks not as good as an iPod at my first glance. But it can play wma DRM which I can get the song cheaper than iTunes. And it use AAA battery so I can use a rechargeable NiMH without worry about when the built-in battery will die someday. The whole package feels like a cheap crap. And it really is. Mine never woke up, it's a DOA. Totally CRAP!!! Got to return it to Sandisk, not the reseller. What is the hell I need to wait for shipping?? Feel very very unhappy about this product. Go to get a new iPod mini now."
4,MP3 okay,"I only use FM stations to listen to preset TV channels at gym or radio stations. Did try to download program and had MAJOR problems after the fact with security and program ""glitches"" due to install which ended up taking off."
2,found a better price,"i ordered this card and 2 days later found it at a store cheaper, so i retured it, no problems"
3,SanDisk 1GB miniSD Card,"Not bad for a mini SD, read write speed is not the fastest and I didn't get a good answer from SanDisk as to what the actual speed was. The price definitely made this a great deal so I'm giving it an average score of 3 stars."
1,its a hoax,"it looks exactly like the SD used in SK3's, but its notits nothing like the picture, make sure you know what SD you use in your phone before you buy it"
4,Nearly Quintessential...Nearly,"My biggest complaint about this particular album is the inclusion of ""Hold onto Something"" by Great Buildings. Many of these songs define my days in high school, but for the life of me I can't remember ever hearing of this band. However, I do remember hearing this song...or one very much like it -- Joe Jackson's incredibly popular song titled, ""I'm the Man,"" from his album, ""I'm the Man"" (1979), which was hugely popular through the early eighties.Re-mixing this album with the correct song would help this album's rating a lot."
1,Don't recommend buying it,"First of all, the quality is poor. Next time I would buy stickers that cover the whole key completely and not only a half of it, so the borders of the key sticker don't get dirty. Second, for the ukrainian alphabet ""'"" and ""'"" are messed up!!! :( ""'"" sticker is actually ""'"" and vise versa. It very disappointing they couldn't get that right!"
2,Falls apart quickly,"I bought this for my dog and within 2 days the spikes started falling out. I bought locktite and reattached them but it seemed as soon as I got one back on another one had fallen out. Past that, the collar fit true to size and was definately a head-turner. Just wish it was a better quality."
4,Fine,"I listened to her second album first, not this one. Thus, this has less impact, but still truck 7 ""better days"" is really amazing! It's so cool. Yet, I can say that the second album is much greater. Check my anther review of her second album. If you have comments, drop a mail @ nakahashi@hotmail.com"
3,Fun toy for the moment,"This was a great purchase for my nephew. He enjoys playing in it but of course, it's very large and folds in an awkward manner. It's a great outdoor product or if you have lots of space but in a small home or apartment it's just too big."
4,Good performances but not very good for dancing,The performances and new arrangements will be good for a listner of tango. But they are not suitable for dancing. The tracks are generally too long and the arrangements are too complex and difficult to dance.
4,"""Godd**n weirdos are taking over this country!""","Hot (for the 70's) teenage runaway Cheryl splits from Ohio and ends up in Los Angeles staying at an old rundown hotel full of weirdos. The weirdest of all is George and he has a crush on Cheryl.Not as perverse as I was hoping it would be (then again no film ever is), but I really enjoyed the atmosphere of this movie. The story moved along at a nice pace and even though it never perved out in a big way I still felt satisfied and would watch it again.The picture on the DVD was great, but I wish there had been a commentary track by somebody. Yea, I know Paul Bartel is dead but somebody must have something interesting to say about this film.Look for a cameo by director Paul Bartel in the park."
4,Good Emo?,"Don't get me wrong.I don't hate emo. But emo is too emo for me. If there is such thing as good emo, Between the Trees' music would be one of them. Their album, the Story and the Song, is beautiful beyond words. Lyrically refreshing and easy to relate to. What could you ask from a band? Unlike many of their contemporaries, Between the Trees is a band with hope and purpose.Soulful voice of the main singer is strikingly similar to Fall Out Boy and Academy Is. Honestly though, Between the Trees' main singer is better voice than these two bands that I have mentioned though. With thousands of emo wanna be in the market, it is hard to find a band original and inspiring as Between the Trees.Strongly recommended for the fans of Relient K, Emery, Academy Is, Blink 182, Fall Out Boy, Sherwood, and Mae."
1,Cheap stuff,"It did not work, i threw it away, bolted it to kids bike tightened down, take king kong to squeeze the handles.It was junk, i wasted my money."
1,Overrated Tony Award Winner,"How could this musical win the Tony award having as a competitor a play like HAIR which - for many people - stands as an emblematic theatre piece of the 60's? Who remembers a tune out of this musical? On the contrary, ""Aquarius"", ""I Got Life"" or ""Walking in Space"" are still popular and they play all over the world. Even ZORBA and PROMISES PROMISES - both candidates for the award in the same year - have songs that are still remembered. 1776 may wake up patriotic feelings to American listeners which is quite understandable but the music and songs are old-fashioned, overrated and awfully boring."
5,boo,it was excellent. highly recommended.it played really good. will order more and more dvds from you in the future at a excellent price. will tell friends how good you are.
4,Track 19 Is Bad,"It's a great album, but be warned that track 19 is bad (on the MP3 download version of the album). It goes silent at around 55 seconds and stays silent for the rest of the song.I opened a ticket and they authorized my account to download it again, but it was the same. I then spoke to someone on the phone, who said they would refund my credit card (for the full album!) and let the MP3 team know that the track is bad, but that it would take some time to get a new version of the track. So I got (most of) the album for free, but that's not what I really wanted. Five bucks is a great price for the album -- I just want track 19 to play!"
4,LOVE,As a Tupperware Sales Consultant we were given 4 cases of this product at our Super Saturday sales meeting. I have used them since and really do love them. The two sided pad really does give you the control to target specific problem areas. The gentle side works great on the sensitive areas and the exfoliating side works wonders on oily areas.
3,tain-ment,"a decent, quick read. yes, she has read ""white noise"" a few times.two issues:--the ""this is how LA people are"" bit got a tired; in a 220 page novel maybe a little less space could be spent on the obvious revelations that they have breast implants, they relate real life to the movies and they eat those ""wacky"" foods.--towards the end of the book the author was still giving us back story rather than plot/character pay off."
5,Just about perfect,"This is a children's book, but adults will enjoy giving it a read now and then. I. It is not a book about magic, but it has magical and somewhat mystical elements woven into it, seamlessly blending with a believable reality. It is good writing, plain and simple, and while the story is anything but plain and simple, it is easy to follow. The complexity is useful in furthering the story and only adds to the suspense, believability and exciting pace of the tale. Even younger children, say, 8 or 9 year-olds, will stay glued to this book like I did some 15 years ago."
4,Cute,Very cute. Just wish the thread count on the sheets were higher for the price paid. After washing them they were very wrinkled and I wasn't about to iron my sons sheets!
2,"Decent towels, trim falls apart","I agree with reviewers that had issues with the trim falling apart on first wash. I thought it was my washer, I started washing all baby's clothes on delicate setting. I like the towel's texture however. They could be better for the price."
2,No Breakfast At Tiffany's,"It looks lovely as travel size Tiffany Shower Gels go... I mean the bottle is very nice you understand. But when I opened it and tried the gel...It was ho hum. The scent was all right but nothing all that elegant or even comforting, just yellow soap in a lovely bottle. Don't get me wrong, I didn't get the mean reds when I used it.... it just left me a little blue. So the next morning off I went downtown to the real Tiffany's, ate a Danish, had some coffee and window-shopped. Calmed me down right away."
2,Mechanism slips,I bought this chair from Office Depot about 5 years ago. It has a very high back which is kind of nice if you want to lean your head back but it looks too tall. Overall its pretty comfortable. My biggest complaint is that the adjustment that controls the front/back tilt does not hold the chair securily. Every time you scoot the chair or lean a bit forward the mechanism slips and you end end up having to tilt it back again.
3,"Cute, but expensive -","For the price 12.00 including shipping, I should have just bought from a store. Chalk it up to impulse buy...and wait and get one in the store. Shipped in a unbelievably large box for no reason, could have sent for less than a dollar."
3,Pretenders,"You wont find a picture of the singers for this cd on the cover. I was miffed when I found out they are mostly all white. You couldn't tell from the name of the group, or the politically correct use of the term African American instead of negro. I was just hoping for the kind of nuance you hear in African American church choirs. This choir mimics the Negro spiritual ok, but you can't help but wonder how much better it would be if they used actual African American singers and direction. The real thing is always better than the pretender. Nevertheless the voices are proffessional so I did get something out of it."
4,"Works great, except for dust bag","I have been running this sander for several years now. It works very well except for the dust bag. It does not attach very well, and tends to fall off at the worst time, especially if you knock it against something.There connection for the dust bag is also a very odd size (square and small) so it makes it impossible to hook a vacuum hose to the sander.The variable speed is nice to have, but I find that I run 100% most of the time.I like the sander other than the vacuum bag."
2,CHEAP AND AMATEURISH,"This film hardly meets the stardards for release. The direction and editing is quite amateurish at times. It's not scary and the death scenes are disappointing.But the lead female is really hot, i'll give you that. Tough only in the beggining you get to see her naked (waist up only)."
3,D-Stink,"Alright, so I don't mean to say that I could build a router better than D-Link myself, but this one stinks. There is about seven feet between it and my HTPC, and I can't tell you how many times I need to repair my connection each day. Furthermore, I sometimes use my laptop on my bed (approximately 3 feet from the antenna) and rarely can I connect to my network. You get what you pay for with this. The hardwire routing is great, but the wireless signal is shamefully weak. I would recommend anything made by Linksys. You pay more, but your product is far superior to anything made by any other company. You can also find cheap routers by Belkin and Netgear - both of which are better than D-Link. God Bless, and Happy Shopping!!!"
3,dont expect too much,the router is excellent as long as it works. but too many disconnections if using more than one system. once it is disconnected it will take a hell of time to come again and we would never know when it is going to work again. apart from this negative aspect it works good as long as wishes to.
3,Nothing gr8,I bought this router hoping that being a D-Link product it should work really well but it dint work upto my expectations. The connection speed suddenly drops and you have to repair your wirless connection from windows before it comes back to 54Mbps
2,Avoid,"The DI-524's setup is just plain lousy.The interface simply hasn't been tested! If you go through the ""Wizard"" you can set up a WEP key, but if you do it through the menu, you get a ""Key1 can not be empty"" error message no matter what you put in the key field(s).Another part of the lousy interface immediately bites you if you try to set up a WEP key. Most wireless cards and routers have a way to set the WEP key from an ASCII string or Hex string or passphrase. Anyone with any sense will want to use a passphrase, so that's the one option the DI-524 does NOT offer. Very lame, very inconvenient, very poorly designed."
3,Works great - but loses signal frequently,"So, I decided to get a wireless router so I could hop into the world of wi-fi gaming with my Nintendo DS and Sony PSP. The router itself works just great. I haven't had any problems playing online and it was simple to set up following the directions the setup disc provided.The PROBLEM however, is that it loses it's signal frequently, causing you to have to unplug the router and plug it back in to reconnect to the net. And this isn't just a once and a while thing, we're talking multiple times in a day on average. Very annoying. So, it's hard to recommend. If I were you, I'd do a little more research into wi-fi and routers before you spent your money on this one. I have had problems with DLink, but this one was recommended for compatibility with the DS and so forth, and so I bought it.If you don't mind the frequent disconnects (like AT LEAST 2 or 3 times during an average day, in my experience) it does what it's supposed to do. And does it well."
2,Troublesome,"Firmware is troublesome. I have an older D-Link wireless router that is excellent, but this one is sharply worse.I was trying to use some of the advanced features (filters, for example) and found the firmware very buggy. I decided to stop wasting time fighting through the problems and return the unit.If you're not going to do anything but run the basic setup and use no advanced features it might work fine for you."
2,Don't Buy This Router!,I bought this router after a friend reccomended it to me. I followed the instructions exactly yet the connections kept resetting continously. I contacted the manufacturer three times and they were unable to solve the problem. I also called my Internet Service Provider and they were no help. I replaced the item and the problems continued.Save yourself the trouble and do not buy this router.
1,"A waste of time, effort, and money for sure!","Fuggettabouditt! Even free, this thing's not worth it. First off, after I connected it all up, it wouldn't respond to it's own firmware ISP call, using I.E. Then a call to the D-Link ""Tech help"" and they couldn't figure out what I was trying to tell them (I speak English)! They kept telling me to ""reboot it"", but there's no power switch. By the time I figured out what oonplooog it meant, I just wanted to talk to somebody who spoke English and didn't sound like a recorded message. After twenty minutes of oonploogging"" and other assorted b.s., I told them to forget it. I had the solution to the problem. Throw it in the trash can! Now D-link would have to PAY ME to use any of their products."
4,"DSL Router, 802.11g, 54Mbps","Well a little confusing on the directions ....But their customer support is nothing but A++,If haveing any probblems with this product just give them a ring!All in all work very well for the price very happy with the dlink system I bought from amazon!"
2,piece of junk,"this router is not worth it. here are my two quirks with it:1) i would lose signal once every 2-3 hours2) the antenna was so cheaply mounted that it just broke off. i moved the router around quite a bit, but the di-524's physical structure vulnerability is needless.3) the router has very bad ventilation. it gets HOT. my linksys wrt54g is much cooler, and i've yet to lose signal on it (had it for about 3 weeks now)"
1,Works for a while and then problems start... not worth it.,"First week it worked without any problems. Then it started disconnecting every 30 minutes or so.. and after three weeks it stopped connecting. I read numerous complaints about firmware problems. But it doesn't even allow me to access setup page.Called customer support and spent more than 2 hours, with no result. Will try to return the product or throw it away.Now I am searching for a router that will work.. you also do the same."
1,I wish foresight was 20/20,"I bought the DI-524 to replace my LinkSys BEFSR41 and to be able to use my laptop wirelessly.The wireless connection was horrible. It kept dropping. The speed would go from 1.1 MBps to 11 MBps & back. I figured, ""well, it's wireless, it's bound to happen.""However, even my workstation that's wired DIRECTLY to the DI-524 would disconnect every 10-15 minutes. I play MMORPGs & getting disconnected even for a second is a very bad thing indeed.I updated the firmware, replaced the cable, replaced my NIC. All the same. I reinstalled my NIC & reconnected the LinkSys & all is good again.I'm returning this unit & I'm going to get a LinkSys WRT54GS instead.Moral: I should have stuck with what I had to begin with."
3,Very basic router,"When I have 2 wireless computers connected, it frequently drops the connections. I know this product is cheap, but please spend a few extra bucks on a better router. It's not worth the headache."
2,Unreliable,I have ver 3. It never provided reliable service. It would drop the signal to both my wired and remote computers. It would irregularly cycle on and off once every couple of minutes. Although it would only be off for a second or two it was enough to stop the flow of data & I would have to start over my downloading. I obviously can't resell this on e-bay so I will donate it.I recently purchased a Lynksys WRT54GS for $70 from Amazon.com that took three days working with their Tech reps from India to get it operating properly. But now it runs steady as a rock.
1,Rather poor,"Really cheap router... saved me a lot of money. However, I had to reset the router very often because it just quit working. I had a few times where the power to my house would flicker in bad weather, and every single time the router just quit and wouldn't accept any new connections until it was reset. All my other hardware, including my Vonage Linksys router, that was plugged into the same circuit protector didn't have a problem with the power flicker. After having this router for three months, it went completely dead and wouldn't power on again when plugged in. After my problems and what I've read other customers saying who have used this router, I'm not even worrying about sending it back."
4,No complaints here. This router works just fine for me.,"I was very apprehensive about buying this router because of all the negative reviews. However, I couldn't resist the tempting price tag and decided to take a risk.Setting it up was a cinch, and so far it's worked liked a charm. I purposely waited for a month before posting this review to make sure that it does not crap out on me. No problems here so far. I would give it 5 stars, but the router's build quality, along with many of dlinks products, does feel a bit cheap. My previous dlink router got stepped on by my fat sister and stopped working. I'm keeping this one away from her foot steps this time around."
1,Crappiest router ever made,"I am writing this review after a thorough research done in the past 2-3 weeks. As it clearly stands out, this is the worst product I ever used. The network connection drops all the time. No reason whatsoever. The router admin page is very poorly designed. Like someone else mentioned, you can't practically do anything with this router. Currently, I connected my old Netgear 802.11b router as my main router and added this one to it. I got it in a deal where I paid only $20 for this. So I have no hesitation in trashing this.Stay away from this router - I dont know about other D-Link products."
3,This Is Where The Happy Go,"While this CD includes most, but not all, of the Trammps greatest hits, most of the tracks are the single length (short) version of the song. This CD would be much better with the long version of the song since that is what you heard in the clubs."
5,dmx is da man!,"he tells about how his childhood was. he felt un-supported, and like his life was just ""slippin"" away from him. i can't believe people rate him as ""the next 2Pac."" 2Pac was more of a criminal and thug, and he really needed to straighten himself. DMX got it goin' on, this is like one of my favorite songs. DMX, thanx for ""getting up"" like you ""gotsta"" and making a wonderful song, and CDs."
2,More Inteligent Design?,"After reading portions I get the feeling this book is intended to be more ammo for the ""intelligent design"" crowd that is hell bent on teaching Creationism in science class in the public schools. Personally, I have no problem with teaching Creationism in the public schools in a Comparative Religion class or similar class, but it doesn't belong in science class. The author seems to want to merge science and religion here and it just doesn't work for me. They seem to be somewhat knowledgable about general science, but alot of the book is conspiracy theory as well. An internet search provides plenty of mainstream scientists ready and able to debunk some (not all) of Missler's work."
5,EXCELLENT,"I've had the album of this since it first came out.. I loved it, and always wished I could have seen the show...of course with Florence Henderson. The songs are delightful and funny...and Florence sings beautifully."
4,"Not What I Expected, But Great For What They Are","I was looking for inserts, but these are no where close. But they do what they are intended to do quite well. They are thin, bald, and a bit hard now. But they are a nice fit in the diaper, pull a bit of moisture away from the baby, and keep the stains off of the diapers. Also, if she poops while I'm changing her, I can just switch one Kushies Liner out for another.Overall, I recommend these; just remember if you're looking for inserts or doublers that you'll need to buy those seperately."
2,NOT WHAT I EXPECTED....ONLY ONE TIME USE,THIS PRODUCT ONLY FIXES THE PROBLEM WHEN USED THEN GOES BACK TO THE LOW INK PROBLEM. I HAD THOUGHT IT WOULD CLEAN FOR GOOD BUT THIS ONLY CLEANS FOR ONE USE....
4,Bitingly True,"I Loved Darkside Zodiac. If you want to know why you do all of the ""bad"" things you do this is the book for you. The books format could be annoying for some readers with its brightly colored pages. Just don't expect the author to say anything nice about your sign because they won't. Also having your birthchart handy will be helpful. A number of websites will produce one for free."
4,Nice carrier,This carrier required some simple assembly which took about 15 minutes. I bought it mainly to use with my motorhome but have used it more with my pickup truck because it is easier to use than just putting the bike in the bed of the truck. It seems to be a good value
2,pH too high!!!,"The back of the bottle says it ""preferentially buffers at pH 7.8, but can manage any pH between 7.2 & 7.8."" My pH shot up to 8.2 from 7.3 after 1 tablespoon of this in my 15 gal tank! What's up with that? The Goldfish Aquarium Board recommends a pH of 7.5 so now I'm worried, although I know pH too high is better than pH too low and my fish seem fine. Still, the product seems a bit extreme, but I've really liked other stuff Seachem has made.. so.. maybe I got a bad batch?"
1,So bad.,"To say this low-budget film is similar to Hitchcock's work is an insult to the master director. Watch it and form your own opinion, but prepare to be disappointed."
3,Compelling,"This smart, disturbing film embodies the best elements of its genre: the emotional and mental demise of Graham, the main character, is inceasing reflected in an altered reality, and the fine line he walks between external and internal monsters becomes increasingly treacherous. A fine study of what can happen when a loveless marriage and meaningless work are pitted against the possibility of real passion."
1,"Dear Ghod, why?","I love independent films. I love films that are made with passion.This is made with ego. From someone who probably should have let the script age a bit first. And gone through a few rewrites. And been edited by someone who hadn't taken a sleeping potion.Really, unless you are looking for a soporific experience, give it a pass."
2,Passionless Wife / Passionless Movie,I bought this dvd based on the positive reviews posted here at Amazon. If you want to see just how dull characters can be ... watch this. I'd recommend renting rather than purchasing.
2,bad,can;t record music from radio to cassette tape.The cassette tape drags plays slow.I tried every kind of cassette tape same result.I wouldn't recommend this product to anybody very poor waste of money.
3,material,"the quality is really based on the price you get what you pay for. If you have a champaign taste, don't settle for beer."
2,cd [;auer wotj cassette recorder,I liked the looks of the recorder. The cd worked fine as did the cassette recorder but the radio had such poor sound quality that I couldn't use it.
4,Decent introduction to VRML,"This is the only VRML book I've read. It is easy to read and requires no prior graphics or programming knowledge. My only complaint is it lacks Java and VRML integration (it does cover JavaSript). Over all, I found it to be a good introduction to a topic of which I had no prior knowledge. If you have any interest in VRML I highly recommend buying a book on it. Virtual Reality Modleing is very fun."
5,"The essence of House - positive, fun, good vibes",This CD is definitely really good - but you should really go see this guy live. It's amazing - people actually DANCE. Not just gawk at the DJ - but really get into the music. I saw him a few months ago at a venue in New York called the Sullivan Room - and it was really great. I have seen alot of DJ's and frankly - this guy has great programming skills (track selection). OM records really has some great compilations - particularly house and downtempo/beats. If you like your house positive and something that will make your girlfriend smile - check this CD out.
5,The Only Christmas Album You Need,"To put this in the category of ""classical"" is a misnomer, since it implies an emphasis on operatic style. On the contrary, this album combines the fantastic jazz style and unique arrangements by Marsalis on selections such as ""We Three Kings"", the soothing and inspirational sounds of the gospel and boys choirs, and the versatile voices of Battle and Von Stade (using both classical and contemporary styles). The ladies' voices blend effortlessly, and their harmonies will stir your soul! There is not a single track that will not elicit an emotion - jubilation, reflection, joy - you name it. The triumphant ""Go Tell it On the Mountain"" is so full of energy and joy it moved me to tears. Hallelujah! Get this one!"
3,"not too good, not too bad","this was an okay cd. it had some good songs i liked, but it was not the best christmas cd i've heard."
5,A classic/modern blend of traditional Christmas selections,"An album I begin listening to after each Thanksgiving to put me in the spirit of Christmas. Listen through headphones and you will be placed in the center of Carnegie Hall and ""experience"" the magic that must have been felt during that concert."
1,Waste of money,"a load of crap and certainly a waste of my money. aside from the movie music interspersed throughout the mix, this cd works if you're still stuck in the goa vortex of a few years back. otherwise, aside from maybe 3 songs, this pales in comparison to Oakie's global underground mix."
1,Dumb Fat Panda!,"THIS IS THE DUMBEST TOY I HAVE EVER GOTTEN IN MY WHOLE 5 YEARS OF MY LIFE! I SAY, ""COME TO ME!"" AND IT JUST SITS THERE! I SAY, ""PLAY DEAD!"" AND IT JUST SITS THERE! THEN I SAY,""YOU'RE A FREAKIN DUMB FAT PANDA!"" THEN IT SMILED AT ME SO EVILY! PEOPLE THINK I'M MAKING IT UP BUT IT'S TRUE! THAT PANDA IS SO GUILTY! GUILTY I SAY! DO NOT GET IT!"
5,Quick Service and Good Product!,"Delivery of product was quick, on time(as promised) and product itself has been working great for my kid during last couple of weeks, brand new and good quality.Highly recommended to buy from this supplier and better yet thru Amazon! :)"
4,Good Book,"This book is great if you want to learn ASP.NET. Within a week I was programming with confidents. However, I don't like it as a reference guide only because this book has an index that [is bad]. It has the main points listed in the index but it's missing alot of topics that were discussed thoughout the book. I still recommend this book since it helped me go from Classic ASP to ASP.NET with ease."
3,Drive for reading floppy disks,"It does a good job of reading disks, but you have to unplug and replug it when changing disks. You can't just eject the disk and put another one in it."
2,No luck with this...so far.,"The 3.5"" external disk drive just arrived (a day ahead of schedule), but so far has been unable to read disks created with WIN98. I get a message saying that the disk is not formatted and offering to do that for me. I've not yet begun all the plugging-and- replugging and searching for drivers, but I am mighty put out that the device doesn't do its one simple task without requiring a lot of troubleshooting. If any other user has encountered and resolved this issue, I'd be grateful to hear about it."
5,Easy install works very well with Windows 7!,"I have always had great success with the Teac product line. Hence, I decided to spend a little more for this particular Floppy drive. I haven't been disappointed. The install was a matter of plugging it into the computer's USB port! There was no software install and the drive is always ready to go! I am completely satisfied with my purchase!"
5,Good item; serves purpose well,Great price. Easy to install and use. Good item for those who have a lot of material stored on old floppies and don't have the time to transfer the information or retype it into new format. I would recommend it to those in this (my) situation.
1,not a good choice,it only plays segments of songs and my girls get frustrated that it won't sing a whole song i wish we knew that before we purchased it i just thought it was a demo mode for in the store
2,Not as good as the old one.,"I had to purchase a new electric razor because my charger for my old Norelco was damaged in an electrical storm.I must say the new model is much lighter, however the quality of the shave and the harshness on my face is less than acceptible.I prefer the older model."
1,"junk, plain and simple","Wow, I am shocked that so many people like this shaver, since it has proved utterly useless for me. It has no power whatsoever compared to my previous Norelco, and I can go over light stubble several times and still feel plenty that it has missed. Just turn it on and you can feel that it's a pretty wimpy motor inside. Plus the trimming blade is set at such an angle that it's very difficult to use without it closing on me all the time. Again, my previous Norelco had much better design/placement for the trimmer in addition to being far more powerful and effective. This model is only passable if you have a very light beard and/or you use it every day. But I consider this a waste of $50, and I wish I had spent more to get something that's actually useful to me."
4,"Good razor, Good value",This model cuts my beard closely and comfortably without needing frequent recharging. The sideburn trimmer works well too. It's a good value for the price.
3,Excellent shaver... for a while,"I bought one of these and was very happy with it for quite a while (maybe a year or two.) But lately it seems to take forever to get shaved, and when I finally give up, I'm not happy with the result. Sure, blades get dull and all that, but this seems to have happened very quickly compared to previous Norelcos I've owned. I wonder if Philips is joining the stampede of manufacturers going for cheap and substandard? I've just bought a replacement Norelco, and if this one goes the same route, after 20-30 years of Norelcos, it's on to some other model of shaver!"
4,Excelent shaver,"Despite the bad reviews about the product I bought it, and I don't regret about. This shaver is what I need, specially for travelling."
4,Satisifed,"Bought this 5 weeks ago. Charge it once a week and it never runs down. Close shave, easy to clean. Only complaint is that the price of the replacement heads is almost what I paid for the razor. On the other hand, if they come out with an improved model for the same price a year from now, I can buy that instead of the heads for the same money (maybe sell the old one on E-bay?)"
2,Not as good as past Norelco shavers,"I was initially disappointed in this razor and continue to be disappointed. I've used Norelco's for many years. This one doesn't stack up to the others I had owned.Reasons why:Cheap PlasticPoor PerformanceWhen I received the razor, I thought: It look cools, but felt like a cheap knockoff in my hand.The motor doesn't seem to have much power. If I go a day or two without shaving, I have to shave three to four times to clean up areas it misses.I still own my old 90's vintage Norelco. I am tempted to buy it new blades and use it over this razor. Before I do that, I will buy an upgraded Norelco and try it. If the new razor doesn't measure up to the old 90's era razor, then I will try buying a different brand."
5,Cafe Life Florence,This book made my trip to Florence worthwhile. Instead of standing in line for a church or museum I was able to sit in the best cafes and read a potted history not only of the cafe but the surrounding area. Joe's interviews with the cafe owners led to the inclusion of some anecdotes you won't read anywhere else! I tasted only the best old fashioned style gelati of every flavour. If the beer was a bit expensive at the Cafe Rivoire the free nibbles made up for it. Following in Joe Wolff's footsteps I was led to various slightly off the beaten tracks parts of Florence and up to Fiesole. If you've already 'done' Florence do it again with 'Cafe Life'. A tip - put the page numbers beside the Cafe Locations on the map to save going back and finding them on the Contents page.
1,This book was the pits,"This book does not tell you anything about what the title of the book suggests. It basically was meant for people who never stepped into a casino. For those of you who expects to get pointers on what to do in order to get more comps, don't bother buying this book. It doesn't even give the most basic strategy about how to improve your comp. By this, I mean that it doesn't even tell you that when you are playing at a table game, to tell the dealer to hold your spot while you go to the restroom. For those of you who don't know this, the reason is simple. While you are gone, your play is still being recorded for a good amount of time until they stop holding your spot. I am going to be returning this book today. So don't bother wasting your money on it"
4,Very Good Thai Green Curry!!!,"Used to use another brand (that changed), in a jar, but this is so much better! Has a very pleasing hot spicy taste with a hint of lemon/lime and a good amount of heat. It is a little too salty though, if you like to use a fair amount to ""spice it up"". We wish it had a lower sodium content. While, made from scratch with fresh ingredients is always better; this is the next best thing! Really good with chicken, beef, pork, tofu and veggie dishes. Quick and easy to make good-for-you meals. We don't like the packaging and wish it were in a jar, but other than that and the sodium content, we like it. Will buy again!"
3,just ok,"i dont really get all the glowing reviews. the book was mildly entertaining, but definitely not something i felt i just couldn't put down. the plot was predictable and i was bored at times."
3,Sounds too expressive to me,"I am a big fan of Mozart's piano sonata #8 (K310) so I simply wanted to hear how Perahia plays it (because I liked his Bach very much when I heard it on the radio). Unfortunately I was not moved by his interpretations at all. His interpretations are indeed lively and expressive, but perhaps a bit too much that they sound nervous and unnatural to me. To be very sure of my feeling, I am listening to it again. And yes, they are too sensitive where I think they sholdn't be.081710Let me update my review a bit. I read somewhere (in a CD's note) a description ""the maximum of virility coupled with the maximum of delicacy"" for Mozart's music. This is so so true if you repeatedly listen to Mozart. So what I really wanted to say here is: delicacy, yes you can find it in this CD, but to me it's a rather faminine one. In my view, one has to pay great attention when playing Mozart, but not to the extent of losing the feeling of freeness."
1,The worst,"We have two of these lenses. Both shut down and stop working at long focal lengths.Tamron wants to charge 140 dollars to fix each one, even though the fact that both have the same defect shows it is their fault.Forget Tamron. They do not stand behind their products and the product is a mess to use."
2,You get what you pay for,"This lens is not a bad deal considering its price and focal range. HOWEVER, if you are hoping for very sharp photos this is not the lens for you. Furthermore the lens (my sample anyway) had quite a bit of chromatic aberation and color fringing. I could have lived with the lack of sharpness but not the color fringing so back it went."
3,Zoom range shorter than 300,"The long range is not 300mm. It is closer to 190mm. Comparing this lens to a Nikon 55-200 VR lens, I focused closer with the Nikon lens using a Nikon D80 body.Before buying, check to make sure it zooms close enough for you. The focus is slower and more noisy than the Nikon VR 55-200 lens. So unless you need the wide side, the Nikon lens is a better deal."
2,"Jim""s rating","I installed the hardware and the wireless router seemed to be working. However I couldn't get it set up properly. The instructions gave a link URL for setup but when I tried to contact it my browser returned with ""unknown page"". They should ship a setup disc with this product. A phone contact was unsucessful. I have since returned the product to the vendor."
1,I'd give it Zero stars if it would let me.,"First off, I was skeptical to try this product, but as a student who lived off Top Ramen before, figured it couldn't be that bad. The item was easy to make, but difficult to cook the noodles evenly. Then to the smell. The smell was God Aweful. Finally the taste test. I can honestly attest that I couldn't even stomache one bite. In fact, after the initial taste... my mouth rejected it and into the trash it went. My coworokers actually complained to the very rank smell eminating from the gabage can. I'd stay away from this one if possible."
1,A waste of money,"Yuck! I thought I'd try this version of instand Pad Thai and I quickly realized it was a mistake. As soon as I took it out of the microwave the smell made me feel queasy. Then the taste test, oh man, it tastes as bad as the smell. I went online searching to see if others had similar experiences and sure enough they did."
5,A spell-bounder!!,"If you are looking for a book to get totally lost in, to be immersed while the world's troubles are put on hold, then this is the book for you! You are pulled in by the very first chapter and as the adventures of the red deer Rannoch unfold, you feel as if you are experiencing them as well. From the title and the description you might feel this to be a children's book but this is simply enjoyable fantasy. One of my main thoughts about this book is..""This is why I read!"""
2,Fire Bringer: No Burning Legacy,"Fire Bringer, written for children ages 9 to 12 will, most likely, be read by adults. The text is far too elaborate for a nine-year old (few will ever finish) and I give it two stars in that category. However, fantasy-loving adults may want to rate the book higher, with a 3 or 4. Fire Bringer has the right formula in a pantheon of strange and familiar beings, a hero with characterist honor and bravery and a dangerous quest. There is even the obligatory map.However, Clement-Davies could have improved the text and held the attention of readers of all ages by writing in the active tense. The book is agonizing to read in its past tense presentation. A change to the active would have made the book read faster and with a better sense of action. Fire Bringer's flame is diminished by its poor use of grammar. Only honest imagination spares the book from total burn-out."
5,My All-time Favorite Book,"I can honestly say that this is the ultimate book. After I read it, all I could do was gape at the foreboding cover in awe. I'm not ashamed to say that I have the prophesy David Clement-Davies so beautifully scripted memorized.The enchanting story begins innocently enough, with courageous Brechin worrying about one of his mates, the bold and beautiful Eloin. And when Brechin is defeated in a fight to the death, Eloin is forced to protect young Rannoch from the fate of his father and, acting on the advice of the wise storyteller hide Rannoch from his own fate. Of course such a thing cannot be done, and as a tyranny envelopes the land, Rannoch is to be recognized as the savior. This fine stag wishes only for peace, and a drastic occurence is all that can force him to go on to fulfill the fate that has long been waiting before him...."
2,"Dated, unclear material","The material in this book is dated (2000). The writing style is highly superficial with little depth not already available for free via java.sun.com. The content is too wordy, not enough pictures/diagrams. The code examples are superficial.There are much better books out there, if you need a book.

5,La mejor producción de Reggaeton hasta la fecha.,"...el reggeatón no volvera a ser el mismo, jamás. En la increible producción ""Contra la Corriente"" Este ingenioso compositor/productor une lo contagioso y lo ritmico del reggeaton con tecnicas de composicion de varios generos de la musica pop, creando un anticipo de lo que luego será la música pop Latino-Americana. Comenzando por las canciones, la produccion, los arreglos, los temas y hasta en la caratula, ""Contra la Corriente"", hace honor a su titulo, dejando atras las demás producciones puertorriqueñas para convertirsen en una produción internacional. Noriega, no solo nos entrega una producción para los seguidores del genero del Rap y Reggae, sino tambien para todos lo que negativamente critican este genero, desplazando en 23 canciones, arreglos musicales que dejaran a Emilio Estefan y Robi Draco Rosa, rascandose la cabeza. El CD esta más que a fuego... no te vas a arrepentir."
3,Photo Misleading,The silver necklace shown in the photograph does not come with the product. You purchase the slide only and have to supply the chain yourself.
1,So much potential...so little anything.,"I really could say that this is the worst movie I have ever seen with the most potential. It is a technological nightmare with the volume of the 'background' music enough to make your ears bleed. The characters have so much potential, but the writing juvenile with the acting to match. The only one worth anything was Bonnie Steiger who really could have been the story-teller of the film with potential. The plot could have been fascinating; the characters could have been endearing, funny, and tragic; the sub-plots of the people could have left you wanting more. Instead...you end up with this waste (not unlike the money I spent to watch it - Yes, I'm kicking my own butt.) which leaves you with the indelible impression that the writer was more wasted than his characters."
5,Fantastic,The music is a very interesting the combination of the orchestra the backing vocals and his backing band makes for a full on dynamic sound it is one of his best.
4,My boyfriend loves it,"I bought this as a present for my boyfriend because he's always asking me to rub his head with my nails. He enjoys it, but only when I use it on him, it's just not the same when you use it on yourself. It's still easier for me just to use my nails. The compactability is nice because it folds flat, but also a pain because sometimes the wires try to fold in when you are using it. Came with a little velvet carrying case, which is nice, but also makes it look like some tortue device if you don't know what it is."
5,Makes Me Happy,This is the coolest thing. The copper version and this Tingler brand are far and away the best. I've tried others and they just aren't the same. Using this on our heads makes me and my whole family feel happy inside!
3,"Ok, but nothing to write home about","Seemed ok in quality, not really all that much fun. It doesn't really ""massage"" in a way that would help with tension headaches or similar problems, just sort of a gentle rubber tipped poke. Wouldn't recommend, unless you just have some money you need to spend."
5,Lorna of Kingston Castle - Sweet story,"This story is an inspiring tale written by a young homeschooled student who has a passion for sharing her commitment to strong character traits. That alone was enough to draw me into this authors world. She has woven a tale of war, love and the need to forgive remarkeably well. The story is witty, funny, sad and hopeful all at the same time. This book is for anyone who would like to put quality writing and high values in the hands of their young kids. I hope to see more from this young author in the future."
5,I've Only One Thing to Say..,"Just listen to ""Lush Life"" !! It will completely blow you away!!R.I.P. Mr. Ferguson.."
4,Maynard Ferguson - Live in San Francisco,I got this CD because the tape I had this album on had worn out! There's the review! It is one of Maynard's best and bears repeat listening. It's GREAT!!
2,What a waste,"This book (and the PMI approach in general) is complicated for the sake of being complicated. It reminds me of the IT guys I used to work with. Rather than just give a straight answer, they couch everything in a wordy overly descriptive soliloquy in order to seem important and smart. Because, of course, if you got any actual information out of them, they would lose a tiny bit of their power (or hit points). Seriously, the PMI took a relatively straightforward discipline such as Project Management and analyzed and 'decompressed' it until it seems deep and heavy - in order to appear more impressive and legitimate. Well, if all of these corporate giants buy into it, we have no choice but to learn it and live it. Good luck brothers and sisters of PM!"
4,The resource every project manager must have,"The Guide to the Project Management Body of Knowledge is the book which defines the practice of Project Management as defined by Project Management Institute. This book is the reference for project managers and a excellent guide the to PM test once a basic knowledge of project management is acquired. Even though it is a great resource for project managers, it is not for those who are learning or new to the project management field. I recommend another book like ""Project Management: A Systems Approach to Planning, Scheduling, and Controlling"" by Harold Kerzner for those who want to learn the subject of Project Management.(T)Hank(s)"
5,This is the bible,"A lot of people would say that the book does not has flow and is not easy to understand etc ............... but so is project management profession to most of the people, even though they believe they do. People say it not practical, but many are the challenges in project management profession, and to deal with them we need to have a sound base of whats ideal. I mean how would you know the risk of what you are doing unless you know how it is supposed to be done.This book is straight and challenges you."
2,Good Reference Material,"It's not very well written for the exam, but it makes a great reference book. You will need other study materials and should not completely rely on this guilde."
2,Reading this book is slow and tedious,"I don't mean any insult to the PMI, but reading this book is slow and tedious. It is best suited as a reference manual. For those seeking PMI certification, it's required reading. But for anyone else wanting to learn project management methodology, I'd suggest something written in a more easy-to-read format."
4,pm411.org Project Management Review,"As others have mentioned, this book is essential for preparing to take the PMP and CAPM exams. However, this book was never meant to be used as a study guide, but rather a framework upon which the PMP and CAPM exams are based. In preparation for the PMP exam, I would recommend purchasing this book and skimming through it to generally understand the various Knowledge Areas and Process Groups. But, I would recommend using a true study guide to fully grasp the concepts - such as Eric Crowe's ""How to Pass the PMP on Your First Try."" Also, to truly determine your knowledge, you need to test your knowledge with practice exams which are readily available in various sites and books.I have used the PMBOK multiple times after passing the PMP as a reference book and guide in my daily work in Project Management.Ron Holohan, PMP MBAwww.pm411.org Project Management Host"
3,"Unfortunately badly written, but absolutely necessary","This book is absolutely mandatory to get a PMP certification, which is nearly a mandatory requirement for being a project manager. These days, it is difficult to get a PM job without this certification. And the only way to get it is by knowing this book from cover to cover no matter how dry and 'dictionary-like' it is.That being said, it is not *that* bad. It is better than, for example, the CMMI 1.2 book. What is missing is why these practices are the ""best practices"" and why you would implement them - what the benefits would be. Also missing is any kind of comprehensible memorable writing style.You're not going to pass the certification test by reading this book, but you can't pass without it either."
1,Absence of knowledge,"340 pages with lists and schedules and more lists and schedules and even more lists and schedules. If that is where you are after, this is a great book. If you want to learn something about how to run a project better, buy something else."
4,Less dry than it could have been,"I must thank the editors for reducing the 3000 pages of PMBOK to 300 pages here. I'll have to read it another 3 times before it all sinks in, because this thing is packed with info. I underlined important parts and I now think that it is more than half underlined!"
2,Guide to Project Mgmt Body of Knowledge,"This is exactly the book I was looking for and it was discounted at the time of purchase which was lucky for me.The most impressive part of the purchase however was the delivery time - which, with only 3 weeks till christmas, I still got the book in 1 week and I'm living in NZ which was truly amazing to me. Thank you for the best turnaround time I have ever experienced from an online/overseas purchase. I was able to take it away with me on holiday."
3,Standard text book fare,Just about every project management class refers to this book so its essential. Text was a nice size. Books a touch floppy so would be best to own as a hardback.
3,A must-have for prep classes,"Not the best organized, but you have to know the stuff for the test, and that's what it lays out, except for the PMI-ism's, which is what the class is for. Fairly easy to absorb, once you understand the layout - the book is nice, large font, way better than trying to manage a print-out off the membership CD."
2,Not as expected,"The title for the book is too much for what you can find inside. They cared much more about the definitions than the actions. It's not really a ""guide"" when you can't find in few words what are you looking for."
4,"Philips Norelco 7110X Cordless, Rechargeable Shaving System","The 7110X is quiet, comfortable and gives me a close shave. Much better than my old National electric shavers. I rate it Great!"
4,Norelco 7110X cordless razor,The shaves are close. The motor is very quiet compared to my previous Norelco's. I chose to purchase a new razor rather than buy the replacement heads. I am enjoying this Norelco edition!
5,Not worth spending more,"Love this razor. Gets the job done, battery lasts for at least a week's worth of shaves. Definitely no flaws and no reason to spend hundreds of dollars when this razor gets the job done."
3,"Great price, but bad item.","This is the worst Norelco I've ever bought. I have had two other Norelcos that my dad and my brother took from me. They were great shavers. The only thing I like about this one is that you can rinse it under the faucet. This thing has a very weak battery. One must go over his face more than twice to get a smooth shave. I paid $25 for it, but I wouldn't buy it for myself."
2,Slow At Shaving,"I've been a Norelco fan for years, and this must be my fifth shaver from them. This is also the worst. I'm not sure why, but it takes forever to shave with this model. It seems to have a smaller cutting area than my previous Norelcos. Perhaps the more expensive models do better, but for now, I'm just living with a longer shave time to get the same results."
3,Just Adequate,"I agree with everyone else that says it takes several passes over the same area to get all the hairs. If there is any length to them at all, it can also pull on them. Ouch! My skin always feels a little irritated, especially around the neck, when I'm done. I've gotten to wear I really don't want to shave, so I only do it like once a week and therefore become quite scruffy looking. I'm realizing that's not going to work in my professional setting, so I'm definitely looking at upgrading very soon."
4,"Good shaver, great price.","At first we thought it had to be garbage because it was so light weight. When we turned it on, you could barely hear the motor. It sounded like it would never cut very good. Once my husband used it, we couldn't believe how close of a shave. It really holds a charge great too. Considering the cost, great little shaver. Doesn't replace those $150. ones, but comes close when you factor into it the cost."
3,cordless shaver,"Works fine... but you get maybe 2 or 3 shaves (days) and it needs recharging, again."
2,A Seriously Defective Shaver,"I bought this shaver four years at my local Target and, after a few months, I stopped using this shaver. For one thing, this shaver creates an uncomfortable and prickly shave. It just hurts the skin. Another major pain is recharging the shaver. It can takes several hours to recharge the Philips Norelco 7110X Shaver but after twenty minutes of shaving the charge starts flicking a red light which means ""low."" It's inefficient, uncomfortable, and takes several hours to recharge. The Philips Norelco 7110 is a seriously defective Shaver. I've had much better results and more comfortable shaving with the generic razors I find at my local Dollar Tree than this way overpriced electric razor."
4,Great product,"Purchased for my husband for Christmas, and he loves it. Says he has experienced no hair pulling or other irritation, likely b/c he lets it grow out a little between shaves, 3-4 days. It does work best when the hair is a bit more than rough stubble...better to use a regular razor if you need a close shave when it is still short, like 1-2 days after a close shave. He did find the 8 hr fist charge annoying, and I keep reminding him that this type of battery works best when it is allowed to drain to near empty before recharging or it reduces battery life. Other than remembering that, it is a great product and he has used it several times, happy each time!"
3,Works only if the hair is thin and shorter length,This might work wor people who shave daily. Does not work for people planning to shave like once a week or longer!
2,For Facial Use Only!,"First off, you shouldn't be shaving anything but your face with this razor. Norelco's older models seem to be heavier and have more powerful motors; this thing is more like those old electric lawnmowers that couldn't cut grass more than 1/2"" high. It gives a middling shave on face and neck, but it certainly can't handle the forest around the Great Oak Tree, if you know what I mean. It also won't do armpits or backs or legs very well.I'd go with an older model that is heavier and seems to have a more powerful motor. You'll need it to clearcut your axillary forest."
3,Philips Norelco Cordless Rechargeable Shaver,I purchased this as a gift. I have had no response from the receiver of this gift. I hope he likes it.
3,dont miss a day,"it appears that if you do not shave every day, shaving becomes more of a chore. it requires me to go over the same area over and over in order to remove some the longer hairs. This wasnt a promblem with the previous shaver that i had, even though i have given the proper amount of time to readjust to a new shaver. ed"
3,Not as good as I expected,"The charge on this shaver holds long enough. However, the shave isn't close. Cleaning is very simple though"
1,Just aweful,"This shaver stinks. I've used Norelco's before, and had a good experience with them. But with this one, I can go over the same area of my face over & over and it still keeps missing those same 3 or 4 hairs. It takes forever to get a clean shave."
3,A little disappointing,"Picked up the 7110X at a bargain price. Since I was in the market for an electric for a reasonable price, I figured a Norelco would be a decent choice. And that's all it is. Decent. Not great, not terrible. It's a great deal for a cordless rechargeable, however the power is much to be desired.It almost feels as if it's running low all the time. It does an okay job of shaving with no nicks or grabs, but it seems to take a longer time than I had expected. It takes several passes to do the job. Not 2 or 3, but as many as 5 or 6 to get the job done. But it eventually gets the job done. The flip-out trimmer works fine. The ability to rinse it out in water is a plus, quick and convenient. I would recommend this bargain shaver for someone who may need an inexpensive rechargeable travel shaver as opposed to a full time home shaver."
4,Eclectic but surprising,"This album surprised me. It's an eclectic mix of Lounge, Rock, and new age.It reminds me of Massive Attack's Protection in some ways, with some Vangelis thrown in here and there.If you're in a mellow mood, I highly recommend this album. Get a glass of wine (or whisky on the rocks) in a darkened room, relax, and enjoy the mix."
3,motorola phone system,"The features on this phone are useful and it was easy to learn to use. The problem is I can't use the phones in most of my rooms because the reception is poor. I have to walk to the few areas in the house where it will work clearly.The accompanying base unit malfunctions. Messages give the wrong day of the week, the chosen ring tones don't work correctly and the light on the screen dims unexpectedly."
5,angry johnnys new bed mat,"This is a very nice thick bed mat. Fits my 95 sierra well. Ive been hauling gravel and firewood lately and its held up well. Doesn't blow around when i do 80 on the freeway either. Err i mean 70. Prompt shipping too, always a plus."
4,A Marines tale,This book was a page turner and I could not put it down once I started reading it. I do work with Al and learned a few things about one of America's true heroes that I did not know before! Well worth the money and time to read.
2,Overpriced EP,"I am a long time fan of Enigk/s, but I felt a little gyped when I listened through this album and noticed that half of the material has already appeared on the previous album, ""World Waits."" For full price it simply wasn't worth it to me. Also, in my opinion the presentation of those same songs on ""World Waits"" was far stronger. Here they just seem like raw outtakes, which may be of value to other fans--just not to me. The few new songs on this album are decent, but they alone do not justify in my mind the $13 I shelled out in anticipation of a NEW record. I probably will not give this one another listen. A bit turned off by this experience."
3,2 year old got tired of it quickly,"Bought this for my 2 year old daughter. For this game you have to be able to use the mouse and to click. She has trouble with doing that and lost interest pretty quickly. She likes the Little People theme for the game though. For my part, I think there is not enough activities in this game. The activities themselves are not that imaginative. I think Jumpstart Baby is a game to get for under 2, then Reader Rabbit Toddler as the next game. Also had trouble installing the game. I had to uninstall quicktime, otherwise the software would not intall it."
5,Great Supplement to the Little People Discovery Airport Toy,"I bought this for my 4 year old twins and my 2 year old little girl. I also bought them the Little People Discovery Airport Playset for Christmas. The twins love to play the games on the computer and then go play with the playset. The computer games gives them ideas for play. My 2 year old can't handle the mouse, but she loves to watch her brothers play. They games are pretty easy for my twins, but they still like to play them. If your kids love Little People, they will like this game."
1,"crashes at startup, no help on the web","I spent the last hour searching the web for assistance with this game.Installed it on my XP, but at startup,it crashes as soon as my son starts typing his name.Help does not exist. I was however able to find many links to other Fisher Price games,airplane crashes around the world (!), Vivendi Investor Relations, and many other useless links.Why do companies that make these games assume that we will never have problemswith them? Why don't they ever have a ""patches and updates"" page?Sigh. Sad state of affairs.."
5,QuickVerse Rocks!,"I have been using QuickVerse on my desktop machine for nearly a decade. Adding the same functinality to my Palm TX is, in a word, FANTASTIC. I no longer have to go home to look something up. I can take advantage of the search capabilities while sitting in Sunday School or Church. I highly recommend this product for Palm users."
3,A Penguin Twist on a classic.,"This is a retelling of Hans Christian Andersen's The Princess of the Pea except with penguins. It's a good story with cute illustrations, but there isn't anything about this book that makes it special or particularly penguin-y. That being said, my preschool-aged daughters love this story and I like that the prince and princess fall in love not because of their royal heritage, but because they spent time together and fell in love. I also love that there are some bigger words thrown in for vocabulary building."
5,Soo cute and festive,Great for kids really fun and amusing way to celebrate the holidays. You will find yourself singing along with the crazy famous critters
3,Starts out great,"The first half of this book was setting up nicely. Fukuyama was making a reasonable case for mostly what he sees as the philosophical cons of the coming reproductive technologies and the need for the government to set up a new entity for regulating them. He spends a lot of time on philosophical handwringing and ultimately doesn't deliver much except the old it's unnatural and will mess up society. I read Gregory Stock's book, Redesigning Humans, on the same subject and I liked the nuts and bolts explanations of things and the ultimate conclusions more. Fukuyama seems to get a lot of attention for how weak I think his conclusions are."
1,Creepy,"This book is sad, depressing, and boring i had to read this for English class and hated it this author needs to get a life and try not to be that weird guy you avoid on the bus."
3,Informative yet annoying,I have been to NY and researched all the spots that were associated with John Lennon and the producers did a good job. Only negaative is the speakers voice....WOW!
3,BLEAK AND DESOLATE,"This album is so bleak and desolate, it's almost painful to listen to. Like another reviewer said, it's like a series of poetry recitations over very stark, alienating music with some very avant-garde sounds thrown in. Cale is my favourite musician and I do like most of his experimental work, but this album is not a pleasure to listen to. It's not that it doesn't contain elements of beauty - Taking Your Life In Your Hands, Thoughtless Kind and I Keep A Close Watch certainly have their moments, while I love the track Risé, Sam and Rimsky-Korsakov just because it's so different from the rest - less cold and clinical, with an otherworldly touch, almost like Ocean Life from Last Day On Earth. If you like musicians like Lydia Lunch or Swans at their most unbearably depressing, you'll enjoy this album, although ""enjoyment"" is not a word I could associate with it."
5,why isn't this movie on queer film lists???,"i have been walking past this movie for years in the video store and passed it up as many times... except this last time.of course raquel is a steammy dream in her flashy and skimpy get-ups [a bonus] but the story is equally as fun to watch unfold. since i don't like to give away too much on a review, i will leave you with a few tidbits to ponder:1] watch it for the cast (raquel welch, farrah fawcett, rex reed, mae west, tom sellek, etc.)2] stay for the mildly eyebrow-raising plot.there is a strap-on.there is a nurse with a bullwhip.there are fabulous costumes made with scant amounts of fabric.there is an acting ranch.there is gender questioning.there is gender non-answering.but for your own good i will leave you with a quote:""i like it when you touch me... up to a certain point.""that's farrah's character to raquel's character. it is what you think.not convinced? you must have no camp in your veins. too bad."
2,IT is CONFUSING!,"The director made half of this movie cause the added clips of old movies, fill in the rest of the movie..This film is for a really small diverse crowd of people , I guess, as the book was!...but Mae & Rachel are fun to watch...just thought that it was a ""ripoff"" by that director...to put in all those clips..The clips were great on their own but to add to this story, I don't think it worked for me...I would not want to be sitting in a movie theater and waiting for Mae & Rachel to come back on the screen!...that's MY review...just saw it last night on CinemaxCheers..Tony(NYC)"
5,PERFECT!,"This cd was exactly what we were looking for! My husband heard this song and was determined to have it as his ""mother son"" dance song at our wedding reception....we looked everywhere for it! It came quick, as we needed it quick and it was perfect! Great CD!"
4,Handy item for take-along warmth,"I have nerve damage in my arm and am very sensitive to cold. I keep a supply of these in my purse and whenever I need to go out into the cold, or even when I'm going into a place that's notoriously cool (movie theaters, brrr), I can open one, give it a good shake, slip it into my pocket or even my sleeve, and I'm good for a few hours.They do take a few minutes to warm up, and if you keep them deep in a pocket, they can cool quickly (fixed by exposing them to air again), but all in all, a great product."
1,"""Lukewarm Hands"": a frustrating disappointment","I have severe Raynaud's syndrome in most of my fingers so I'm always looking for new disposable hand warmers. I had high hopes for these because of the positive reviews, but, unfortunately, they are the worst I've ever tried. To date, I've used 6 of them (in the ""20-pak"" I bought), and all six were very disappointing. After 40 minutes, they got mildly lukewarm and then they cooled down totally after 3 hours. They're worthless. I don't expect hand warmers to get so hot that they burn my skin, but I do expect them to radiate enough heat to warm up my frozen fingers. And they don't. (As an afterthought, I reread the most positive reviews to see why they had convinced me to buy this product and I realized that they are so inaccurate and sound so much like advertising copy that they were probably written by a company shill). I urge you to save your money and buy another product that works."
5,Excellent synthpop/electronic compilation!,"The numerous various artist compilations that have been released on A Different Drum since 1996 are among the best compilations in the synthpop/electronic genre. Synthpop Club Anthems is, in my opinion, the best compilation the label has released to date. This is an excellent collection of remixes, representing some of the finest synthpop bands out there (Neuroactive, Echoing Green, Wave in Head, Iris, and System22 are personal favorites). There is not a weak track on here. For those familiar with the bands, this is a great collection of remixes; for those unfamiliar, this is a great introduction to them."
2,needs separate songs,Was really hoping there would be more learning songs on this cd. I was disappointed for the amount I paid.
4,Once again the Doctor flirts with a parallel universe...?,"Parkin's first book for the ""New Adventures"" series is seamlessly plotted and while effortlessly readable, also challenging and highly absorbing. Parkin sets out to avoid most of the usual sci-fi stereotypes in this book set during an apparent German invasion of the Channel Islands during World War II. The Doctor and his companions take seperate paths to investigate the development of a secret German superweapon, leading them all to believe that history has been horribly perverted...but is the Doctor the real cause"
1,"First book yes, forget the rest","The first book of the series is great, but after than it really goes downhill. It becomes a real mess.Just read the first book."
2,Rusty,After using this at the gym for about 2 months it's all rusted through. If it wasn't for the rust it would have been nice if slightly big.
1,Dollar store junk,"This tote is no better than something you would find in any dollar store and Amazon is selling it for $5, it's shameful! It's a small piece of junk that wasn't big enough for my 10 yr old to take to Boy Scout camp! BEWARE the picture makes it look much bigger than it is!"
2,seventies madness...,"saw this when it came out. the dvd seems to have scenes cut.(common complaint with me). a cynical,liberal extreme view that later turned into hill street blues. both seem dated/other world now, (at least to me). it's the chopping up that makes me angry, even if you haven't seen it before, you can tell something's been cut."
1,"Mother, Jugs and Speed",The movie is a good movie the product was garbage. Didn't work. No return policy. Will not buy from them again.
4,edited?,"Two odd things about this DVD:1) It's got some edited/dubbed-over vulgarities while others are left as is....how'd THAT happen?2) Toni Basil as a shotgun-toting junkie?Fun movie though with some disturbing elements too, but we're all adults, deal with it. It was the 70s and a double helping of them at that."
5,"compact folder, pretty style, very sturdy","This arrived on the doorstep last night, first question in my mind, why such a gigantic box? There really isn't a lot to do here just pull it out of the box, take off the plastic and unfold it. It folds very easily and the wheels already installed on the back feet can be removed and replaced with covers which come with it. Bought this for mom who really can't deal with a cane anymore, we have a small house and there is not a lot of room to walk around between furniture etc. Only one bottleneck to deal with otherwise in this old 50's house with tiny rooms and tiny doorways the walker does fine. Mother can even pick it up without too much complaining. Nice product. Legs adjust easily and there are quite a number of selections too. She's short it came out of the box the right height already."
2,Non Amazon vendor sent wrong item,"Oregacyn works wonderful for my wife and I as we have had no colds or respirators illness for the three years we have been taking OregaCYN. Unfortunately, the non Amazon third party vendor sent OregaRESP... not the same. When contacted several times, they did not respond."
5,Be Rich,"This is a wonderful, well written book on how to make the necessary changes in your life to ""Be Rich""! The author is well educated and confident in the material, and makes a special effort to use multiple examples to educate the reader in the power of different ways to think. This book has been an inspiration to me. I have implemented many positive changes in my life and I recommend this book to all!"
1,DON'T BUY!!,"SIX (6) Pages of errata on the wrox web site, and counting. Sample programs that don't compile. I'm half way through, and I don't believe a word I read. I'd take it back, but I marked in it. Thinking of pitching it. My last Wrox book. Absolutely unusable. I've heard the next book in the series, ""Professional C#"", is just as bad."
4,"Describes foundation of C#, .NET and VS.NET","This book will probably be a hit or miss for you, with no in-between ground. You can see by the reviews people either loved it or hated it.I believe some people like to make assumptions about the basics of a language as they learn the more complex subjects. Others like to see the basics spelled out, then take off like rockets.If you fall into the second group, as I do, then I think you will enjoy this book. I probably won't refer to it again, but reading this book will help me absorb the more complicated aspects of using C# and .NET all the faster.I like to separate learning _what_ all the new C# and .NET features are, from _how_ I should use them. This simple book focuses on the _what_. With a solid understanding of the pieces of C# and .NET, I can now focus exclusively on learning _how_ to best use these new features, via other books."
3,"Good, Not great.","This was useful, but did not keep the med cold for as long as I needed it to. The ice packs just didn't last long enough in a warm car traveling for 10+ hours. The compartments weren't exactly what I needed, but overall it was adequate. It is well made, but needs more insulating qualities built in to it."
5,Love the cold storage,"This holds a lot of supplies, and the cold-gel packs keep everything within a safe temperature. This is great for travel."
2,It's just okay.,The case shipped and arrived very quick. It is large enough to hold supplies for a week or so.What I did not like and am having problems with are the follwoing:1. The medical waste pouch sealer is broke. The zipper sealer is broke and broke very quickly.2. The velcro is coming off the pouch. Looks like it was sewn on and not adhered correctly.3. The elastic loops that hold insulin pens and maybe a lancet device have become loose and do not hold the devices very well.We have had this bag less than three months.
4,functional,"the product is shown and fulfills its purpose very well, I recommend all the parts shown on the package very good"
3,Functionality seems fine,"Liked the product, although early stages yet. The zipper looks very weak though and I am not sure if it will last too long."
3,"Is is washable? If so, How, in washing machine or diswasher",Mine has gotten quiet dirty and I am not sure if the mechanism will be ruined if I wash it. I am hoping someone will let me know how they washed it.
4,Still a Norelco,"As expected, the new 7180XL razor delivers a close and comfortable electric shave, even though it runs much slower than earlier models. The slow speed does make it very quiet and the new cleaning method is very handy. Just 2 noticable disappointments:1. The external power supply is a rather combersome change from former Norelco products.2. The exclusion of a storage case is certainly an unwelcome ""feature"" of an otherwise good product at a premium price."
5,"Finally, a decent Norelco to replace my dead Quadra","I had about abandoned hope that I would ever find a suitable replacement for my beloved Norelco Quadra 6886XL that bit the dust. I tried both the SmartTouch and Arcitec models and they just didn't deliver a decent shave for me. Then I discovered the 7180XL, which uses the same shaving heads as the old Spectra series. It has given me the same close & comfortable shave that I used to get with the Quadra. I get 10 shaves on a single charge and my battery low light only comes on about the 9th shave. Plus it rinses clean with hot tap water - a decided advantage on a busy work morning. I highly recommend this shaver!"
3,Smooth shave but...,"I've owned this razor for about two years now and while it does give me a relatively close and comfortable shave the battery life is starting to show its limited use. I would charge it for about eight hours and the charge usually lasts for about one shave. I don't even have that heavy a beard, and a shaving session lasts for about three-four minutes. I'm guessing that the battery should last longer than two years, but maybe that is normal, I don't know. I will admit that the blades have stayed sharp, but as I've mentioned, I don't have a heavy beard which would entail more wear on the cutting blades. I would like to replace the battery but do not know if replacement batteries are even possible. It would be a shame to replace the entire razor after two or three years but if this is the norm for Philips/Norelco razors then I will have to consider other brands."
4,To clarify older reviews...,"I do realize that the previous reviews are 5-6 years old, however I would like to point something out.Hopefully the reviewers are a bit more experienced now (one did admit he was inexperienced), then they would realize/know that Bokken (the wood swords) are to be used for practicing form only. For sparring one should use a Shinai (bamboo sword)...that is what they are meant for. Sure, these look better, but once more...they are meant for practicing form only. For that, they are quite useful."
4,Excellent Young Adult horse fiction,"This is a fun book, a realistic rather than romanticizedstory about the trials of growing up andworking with horses. A good read for older horse-lovers."
4,Bodystocking.,"It was a little big on me, and I'm around 5'6'', but overall it was extremely good for the price."
4,Minus One Star Because Mrs. Robinson Is Horrible,I had a roommate in college who wanted to use Green Onions as his wedding processional. But years later when he got married he didn't do it. Pity.
3,a good start for managers in understanding Software Engg..,"this book is a good start for managers in understanding the software engineering process. it talks about the the effective practices that are to be followed.it is consice and can be used as a ready reference for certain technical issues like software configuration management, metrics. it gives an insight to the CASE tools available. its worth buying this book if u r looking for a begining."
4,Fellowes Shredder,"I read that you should always cut the sheet number in half. This one says 17, so I figure 8-9. So far it handles everything I throw at it, credit cards, cd's, paper. Some mail I shred without opening...no problem. It's big too. I haven't changed the output basket yet. I rated 4 instead of 5 because I have only had it for a couple months. No long term data."
4,Perfect for Home Office,"My older shredder failed several weeks earlier so my new Fellowes Powershred SB-97Cs 17 sheet Confetti Cut Shredder immediately faced a wall of paper. It quickly and efficiently chomped its way through the huge stack. Never had a jamb. It has worked perfectly since. The longer I have it, the more I realize my earlier machines were made for a sheet here and there, not the piles of paper I generate. Perfect for the home office.Mike"
4,Fellowes Paper shredder 32197,JUST GOT IT AND HAVE NOT HAVE THE OPPORTUNITYT TO ACTUALLY GIVE A GOOD ASSESSMENT BUT I DO HOPE AND AM CONFIDENT i HAVE PURCHASED A GOOD PRODUCT.
4,Junk Mail eating Monster,"This thing eats junk mail like Homer Simpson eats donuts, but not for more than 20 mins. straight. Let it rest for it to digest. (Burp!)Don't forget to use shredder oil periodically to keep it smooth."
5,Best Shredder Yet,"We do a lot of shredding in our home and I was going to call the mobile shredder to come out and handle our old boxes of papers dating back 6 years. Instead, we ordered this shredder for the same cost as the mobile shredder and it worked fast and furiously to get the job done! It's quiet and quick. I even accidentally put in some paperwork from the vet that had a metal rabies tag and s-ring attached to it, and the shredder kicked it back out. I thought after that the shredder would die, but it kept going. It did have to stop for a ""break"" every 30 minutes or so, but that's because we were really taxing it. It was quite the trooper, though, the miserable task was over in no time and we still sing the praises of this shredder. I don't think you are going to find a better one on the market and the price is unbeatable. Oh, and it has a guard on it to protect little hands, very important in our home with two little ones."
2,Why did the author knock author John Costello?,"Carter wins on giving us numerous minutia about Blount's life and his odd selection of friends. But her book was not of great interest to a reader who was aware of Blount's peculiar nature and interest in art. It is difficult to understand how Blount or his friends, seemed completly oblivious of politics as Carter has laid out. Unless she is making the case that Blount was the perfect mole - at all times on guard against exposure. But I don't think she is trying to make that case.Carter gives us a blur of names, quotes, and a failure to find mention of expected comments in corresspondence such as the passing of Blount's father. It may be Carter's intention to show Blount's world as an extremely focused life which was hardly influenced by outside events; such as the end of World War One and the rise of Communism. I suspect Carter is trying to explain Blount as a Good Boy Who Does Bad Things."
3,Credibility,"Wright and Blunt and bits of gossip. Carter read it as ""Clarissa Churchill, the daughter of Winston Churchill"". Wright wrote it as ""His funniest story concerned Guy Burgess and Churchill's niece Clarissa"". So how reliable is the rest of it? Will her next work delve into just what all those others were up to? How about Eddie Playfair? Dull? He was joking of course! But Miranda interviewed these guys - has she yet told all she found out?"
2,Not a man to know . . .,"The book is well-written, but Blunt and his circle are very""precious"" in their interests and relationships. It is rather like reading about a curious creature than about someone you would have enjoyed knowing. He was a warped man, not a sympathetic character at all. This book would be ""way down"" on the list of interesting biographies to read."
4,Not all vampires can be scary...,A story of a little boy and a vampire who is always getting in trouble. Highly recomended for a gift to a kid aged 9 to 14.
5,Solid Brass Push Plate,"This is a great product. My use for this product was not based upon what it was designed for. We have 3 little dogs who do not like being locked out of rooms, so over the past 5-6 years these little darlins have scratched the bottom of all doors that are shut to them. The scratches are too deep to restain, and I didn't want to refinish the entire door. I purchased a number of these beautiful brass plates and mounted them on the bottom of the doors where the dogs always scratch the door. These plates leave my doors looking brand new, and although the dogs continue to scratch the door plates, no marks are left......a beautiful great solution, and our doors now look custom made."
3,Tamron 1.4 teleconverter,"I purchased this teleconverter last week and when it arrived, I tried to fit it between my Canon T1i and either of my Canon lenses. It went on the camera but I could not attach it to either lens (one being the standard lens the camera came with). After struggling with it, my husband noticed the instruction manual said it would only work with a Tamron lens. I do have a Tamron lens and tried it out. Sure enough it fit. But I really bought it more to use it with one of my Canon lenses. There is no mention in the description on Amazon that it is for use only with the Tamron lens. I'm going to return it since it doesn't really suit my purposes. I'm sure it works fine with the Tamron lens but it should have specified that in the description."
3,VERY USEFUL,I have a 5D mark II and the Canon EF 1.4x II and EF 2x III teleconverters but with the original Canon (or with the Tamron Pro ) we cannot have autofocus with a Canon EF 100-400. With this small converter we still have autofocus with the EF 100-400. So this is a layer very useful in the field once at home I haven't any problem to do the manual focus including with the EF 2x. In a safari for instance it is quite diferent. I recommend it is inexpensive and very useful. If you don't like you don't loose very much.
3,"This is NOT a ""how-to"" book.","I purchased this book after reading the feedback and other information. Overall, it could prove to be helpful as my website matures and business grows, however, as a novice I needed something more hands-on and how-to. The information contained in the book is valuable, but not helpful to me at the moment. I found myself saying ""that's great, but how do I do that."" Now, if I were planning to pay a website developer, this would surpass my expectations."
2,Hardly worth it,"This antenna allowed me to receive 2 HD channels in my area, but it gave me no better reception than my thumb placed over the end of the coaxial cable. Basically any antenna will be as effective as this."
5,"Better than those old ""Rabbit Ears""","After reading reviews on various HD antennas, I settle on the Philips PHDTV1. It was easy to assemble (no screws; everything snaps into place), and it fit easily on my TV. With the ""rabbit ears"", there were a couple of stations that I would only pick up sporadically. Once I started using the HDTV1, I received all of the digital stations and with improved signal strength. I would definitely recommend this for your TV if you are getting over the air transmissions!!"
3,Amazing antenna with design flaw,"This is my second silver sensor. These devices perform better than any ""rabbit ears"" I have ever used. However, the second one had a faulty cable connecter which I was unable to repair. I had attached a cable but could not unscrew it. I tried to use pliers to loosen it but only suceeded in twisting the wires until they broke."
2,Will end up in the trash...,I'm unable to receive one major network (NBC) and only receive PBS 1 & 2 intermittently. I live near the center of a major metropolitan area and I've spent much time adjusting the direction of the antennae trying to receive better reception to no avail. I've ordered an Antennas Direct DB2 Multi Directional HDTV Antenna today and expect much better performance.
1,not different from any other antenna,"you can get just an ok picture, not too good.the antenna's cable screws are very weak, they break even whenn you screw them with your fingers"
3,Not for Rural Areas,"Purchased this with the Digital Converters hoping it would pull in at least on channel. However, living in the rural area I live in, this antenna does not do the job. I was told that the old rabbit ears will do a better job."
3,Performance depends on tuner,"I tried this unit out with a friend's Pinnacle USB tuner, just to see if I could receive adequate signals before buying a HDTV tuner. The antenna/tuner combination worked fine, pulling in all 13 digital channels that were in my area. I then went out and purchased a Samsung HD TV Television Tuner (DTB-H260F), and the Phillips antenna, and could only pull in 7 stations. I tried moving it up to my attic, but that only added 2 stations. I proceeded to buy an amplified antenna at Home Depot, and can again receive all 13 channels as originally with the Pinnacle tuner and this model antenna. I'm 6-7 miles from all the stations - and all are within a 5-10 degree arc, so I presume that the lack of performance is due to the Samsung tuner wanting a stronger signal, and not my inability to point the antenna in the right direction.Bottom line - it might work for you, then again, it might not."
2,DIDN'T DO MUCH,This is a very cheaply made product that only brought in a few channels and most of those were shopping channels. Oddly enough though it only brought in 3 network affiliate channels that kept blinking in and out it brought in an independent channel from an adjoining state perfectly clear. Perhaps it depends on where you live but I am up on a hill in the Boston suburbs and expected better reception with this.
2,Not good enough in Ann Arbor,"This failed to pick up a consistent signal here in Ann Arbor, no matter where I put it. It seems that an indoor antenna isn't powerful enough in this area; you'll need either an outdoor antenna, or cable. It's about 40 miles from here to Detroit, where the nearest TV signals originate, so I'd infer that you have to be closer than that to the source in order for this device to be useful.The device is also clumsier and less attractive than its picture might suggest. Keep in mind that it's more than a foot wide and just as long (from front to back); think carefully about where you're going to put it before you buy it."
2,Bummed,Got the Digital Antenna because we got the converter box and got no channels with the old rabbit ears. Upgraded to digital as recommended and we get one channel.
1,returned it.,"The item did not work in my location, so I returned it in it's original package as per instructions. I hope that I get the credit back as I used my credit card to purchase it. I returned it last month."
1,Very disappointed with the reception quality of this antenna,"I live in a major city and got this for a small (10"" screen) quality, new portable HDTV. I was barely able to get two of the 8-9 stations I can get with a $20. RCA basic ""rabbit ears"" set! I am so disappointed in this fancy looking sleek antenna. I also wasn't impressed by the flimsy and lightweight plastic base and lightweight metal ""fins."" Next time, I'll stick to the old tried and true rabbit ears, which I have already ordered to replace this piece of junk."
2,Modern Technology,"I compared Stone Age to ""Modern Technology"". Stone Age wins and is CHEAP.Go get a T wire antenna and an adapter for wire to coaxial for a couple of bucks. Hook both wires to terminal A instead of A and B. Also try both to B to see which gives best reception. As good as, or at my location out performs, ""Modern Technology"" for Regular or HDTV."
1,product switch & very poor quality,"The Phillips Silver Sensor indoor antenna arrived packaged and identified as a Zenith antenna with the same appearance but of poor quality (the cable came off the antenna attachment) and the reception was abysmal. My first contact with the vendor was quick and very accommodating as was my reply but I have heard nothing further from the vendor. Follow up has not occurred since I responded affirmatively to the vendor's kind offer.Words, just words!"
3,Not compatible with an Ipod.,"I like the CD but am a little frustrated by the fact that I can't put it on my Ipod. I can understand why they want a ""Copy protected"" CD but you should be able to download it to any portable listening device. Apparently it is compatible with some portable players but not Apple/Ipods."
3,Not my favorite,"I ordered 4 different categories and these are probably my least favorite. The wolf, bison and orangutan look a little odd (because of their angle or due to them just being heads). But then the full-shot ones are a little too big for small kids. I'd pick something else."
1,"Very, very thin","Not much here to help novices and certainly not for anyone with the vaguest idea of how scripts ""work."" Very skimpy with examples. There's so much ""nuts-and-bolts"" knowledge that's necessary to create a good script or treatment, and this book provides little of it."
5,"Easy to read, great information, helped me get started","This book is full of very good information. It is easy to read and every chapter has exercsies to help you practice what the author suggests. I've written my first treatment and it is being reviewed by an agent. If you have an idea for a TV show or movie, this book is a great first start."
4,This is a Great Project,"This is really good hard rock,singer sounds like gary barden.Songs likephotograph fades and never goin' home are just really well written and areso catchy.If your into Silver and gary barden,this is a must have!!"
1,Who are these guys???,"I heard this comedian on comedy central mention death metal bands lke obituary and mortuary and no one, including me, doesn't know who the hell mortuary is!"
5,Dedicated Mobile Base,"This is the third, dedicated mobile base I have purchased. The first was tool dealer supplied, the rest I purchased as a result of satisfaction with the first. I also have a universal base or two from HTC. Amazon is amazing with surprisingly quick turn around from order to deliver. I am very happy with the product, price and quick delivery. tedwick"
4,Very Good Debut CD!!,"Darrell Diaz is a multi-talented musician from the west coast who has played with some of the greats of jazz including Oscar winning composer, Herbie Hancock. His publicist gave me the chance to review his work and I must say his debut CD is rather impressive. The track, ""Come Back to Me"" has a nice saxophone by Keith Fiddmont. The title track is by far, the best on the album with his mentor, Hancock giving an assist. Though a few of the CD tune melodies were repetitive, I was still enthused by the quality of the recording. I liked the flavor of Latin Jazz, R&B and Smooth Jazz. It's a very good debut CD that I would recommend anyone to purchase. I look forward to hearing more from him."
5,The best DVD Upconverter under $1000,"I have tested 4 different upconverting DVD player. This is the only one I have tested that I would recommend. The results were excellent on my 72"" HDTV. Price was reasonable and it was quick and simple to set up. Makes all my standard DVD movies look like HD DVD movies. A must have for those who have HD television."
5,Excellent service!,I bought this unit after seeing all the favorable reviews. I needed to replace a couple older DVD players which were constantly freezing up or skipping entire chapters. I've never experienced those problems on this unit. Some dirty looking DVD's even played fine. After 4 months I experienced a 'DISK READ' error. I'm sure this isn't a common problem but being in the electronics service industry I know that s*%t happens. I must say I was impressed with Oppo's service dept. The turn time for repair was less than a week from my door back to my door without even a penny spent. The player seems to be working better than ever. Thanks Oppo.
4,"Great Picture, no true digital 5.1 DVD audio out!","So, I bought this Opp DVD player for the same reason most of you are reading the reviews, the up-converting! However, I also bought it because it had a lot of great music related functions, and I listen to a lot of 5.1 DVD audio! Well, I was very surprised to find out that you cannot run DVD audio directly out to your home theater system in digital form (i.e. SPDIF etc.). You have to use old fashion RCA cables to make that happen. The manual says that they cannot offer this due to copyright restrictions . . . What? This makes no sense to me as you can burn DVD's, but not play true digital audio? Weird. Anyway, if DVD audio is not a major concern for you, then this is an excellent DVD player to buy!"
1,broken on arrival,"When this unit arrived, it would only display the main menu if a disk wasn't inserted. Once a disk, any disk, was inserted the output from the hdmi port went away with only an occasional, miscolored, out-of-sync image flashing across the screen. The svhs output functioned normally, but that's not why I purchased this thing. I returned it to Amazon."
5,It is just...AMAZING..!!!,"I am having this DVD player for almost a year. It is a reliable and durable machine overall .I do really enjoy the features that it can convert the PaL DVD movies ( for Europe, Asia...) to be playback on NTSC HDTV with superb image quality !If broken ? I would go for it again !!!"
4,OPPO takes over.,"I had heard some buzz from my super-geek friends, a new game perhaps for their 40 year old brains to ponder......No, an upconverting DVD player from China that was only $200.00 and played everything, and was rated higher than the best brands. I caught their religious fever, and tried the new cult icon.Yes, yes, I believe in OPPO, it works, it is elegant and simple, even my old dvd's look great, it has HDMI which makes the sound terrific, too. I am building a Home Theater shrine around its smooth Black design.This is going to give me weeks of pleasure before.......the Next Big Thing!"
2,Missing Half-Note,"This machine does not reproduce the first half note of many selections on CD. The Oppo technical support team informed me that they are aware of this but there are no plans to fix it. They attributed the problem to the processing chip. So, if you want to hear entire tracks while listening to music, this is not a machine you will enjoy."
4,A Winner,"For an upconverting player it does a great job. Very close to the high end HD players, it is what it is and I'm not sorry I bought it. when you see the quality of picture it puts out to your hd tv compared to regular upconverting players with HDMI outputs (and you will notice.) you will know you made a good purchase. Great player to tie you over untill you decide to take the big plunge to HD or Blu-ray."
5,Couldn't be happier with the Oppo DV-981HD DVD player,"Everything about this DVD player is top of the line. There is nothing that it hasn't been able to play unlike my previous two DVD players that supposedly would play all formats. The 1080p upconversion is a bonus that keeps my existing movie library from being obsolete with the addition of a 1080p TV. Although I wasn't familiar with the brand name of Oppo, after spending many hours reading reviews and checking out the forums, it became evident that Oppo had something going for it. Even the high quality packaging leads you to beleive that what is inside is not your everyday DVD player. First quality from the outside in! I can't say enough on how satisfied I am with this purchase and will recommend Oppo to anyone considering a DVD player purchase."
3,problem with DLP technology,"I bought this product through amazon and at first was very pleased. Weeks after I started seeing blotching in the dark areas of the picture during playback. Called Oppo and they can't return or refund since the purchase was through amazon. They told me that with the ferudja upconversion technology there was a conflict when it came to dlp televisions. Hopefully amazon will take it as a return. Upon further investigation under page one of the general set up menu, scrolling down there is a color space option. It was set to ycbcr 4:4:4 from the factory. I changed it to auto and PERFECTION i wish i would have rated it a 5 star!"
5,Up-converting DVD player does not get better than this!,"I decided to go with this player due to all the positive reviews here and elsewhere. I am really happy with the performance, quality and bang for the buck this Oppo player provides. Frankly I do not think there is another player in this price range that provides the kind of picture this unit is able to squeeze out of standard DVD movies. Utterly artifact free picture, seamless layer changes, film like quality and quiet operation. As long as you take the time to properly set up for your HD display native resolution, you will be amazed how good standard DVD discs can look. Slightly soft in comparison to true hi-def sources but truly amazing. Until the catalog of Blu-ray make that format a must have, this is the player to own. Only minor quibbles with the remote layout but nothing else to complain about."
3,Isuzu Axiom Brake Pads 2002 from 11/01,"These are good pads. This is the second set I bought. The price is right. The Ceramics are supposed to give you less brake dust and stop better. The stopping power is good, but the brake dust is the same as others. I would buy again."
2,Word Salad,"This is an extended version of the some parts of the author's book ""Technical Analysis Explained"", especially the parts on chart patterns. Nothing much added to this subject by thicking those parts of the above book. These parts are better presented (brief and short) in the original source."
3,It Is What It Is...,"For the price, this guitar case does the job. It is much flimsier than I expected, and I was a bit taken aback with the bright gold latches - for some reason I thought they'd be steel/silver in color - but I guess what can you expect for the price and $3.95 shipping?I would've upgraded to their next case which has plush lining to protect my guitar better since this case seems to seriously be heavy cardboard with a plastic coating, but the shipping on that item was upwards of $28. Quite a difference in price.I am a newb at the guitar and so this case will serve its purpose for now - protecting my inexpensive instrument. Just know that the case is not extremely sturdy and you get what you pay for!I would not purchase this case if you have an expensive guitar that you cart around from gig to gig that needs protection. If you are a beginner like me and have a so-so guitar, it will work, hopefully, until you are ready for an upgrade."
1,Totally disappointed ...,"Although the staff at the company where the harptone chipboard guitar case came from are quite friendly and eager to assist, I am totally disappointed in this product. I wouldn't be had the description stated that it wasn't lined; however, this case wouldn't protect a guitar from anything. The case is nothing more than laminated cardboard. I would NOT recommend this purchase for any guitar that means something to someone."
4,madden 08 psp is good,"very good game, must have for all psp owners.. great play, can get old after a while but there is much to do to keep u interested. GO RAIDERS!"
3,"holds a 17"" laptop nicely- wish it were a bit more professional looking","Functionally I give this product 4 stars. It holds my 17"" laptop nicely. It would get 5 stars functionally if it could handle a bit more thickness-- as it is, a large charger will cause this bag to bulge out more than I like. Also, the shoulder strap gets tangled up quite often- annoying.Stylistically, I give this product 2 stars. It has gaudy bright yellow lettering with flat black and gray. It might be at home in a university but I find it embarrassing as I walk into the office or airport. I suspect Targus makes other products that are better looking and functionally equivalent..."
4,Zipper City,"THE bag for people who like to compartmentalize----I lost count of the number of pockets and zippers. The shoulder strap is comfy but doesn't detach. So if you want to just carry the bag by the handle, the strap is either in the way or must be folded into the interior of the bag. BTW, I got this for [...]."
4,The really big bag that I rarely use.,"This is a nice shoulder bag designed for laptops up to 17"". It was bundled as a free item with the purchase of my HP laptop. That is all very nice. I think that they were matched up because the color schemes matched. The quality of the bag is good. The shoulder strap could be a little wider for such a large bag. There are lots of cool inner pockets for every function imaginable. The problem is the laptop that I got this with is a 14"" widescreen and it just gets swallowed. Plus I felt compeled to use all the space in the bag which makes it quite heavy. I wish it were the 15"" bag of this same production line. That would make more sense. As for daily use, I don't use it. I use my laptop backback. It is hard to beat. Anyone looking for a good quality LARGE bag will enjoy the laptop carry all."
4,Good Value,The case has plenty of room and is well padded. The fact that it tends to fall on its side is a slight annoyance. Overall its a good value.
4,Great. Especially if you plan on carrying a bunch of stuff.,"Pro's:-Lots of space and organized very well.-Zippers seem to be of good quality-Shoulder strap is comfortable-I've got a Toshiba Satellite L555 17.3 inch laptop and it fits with plenty of space to spare-Well built (as you would expect from Targus)Con's:-The strap that keeps the laptop in its compartment is not adjustable and is quite long, allowing the laptop to jiggle around a little bit. I wish it was adjustable because I want it fastened tight.Other:I really do like this case. It is quite bulky so if you're not planning on carrying a lot of stuff you may want something smaller."
5,Best Low-Cost Laptop Case,"If you have a 17"" laptop and want a sturdy carrying bag with space enough to carry all kinds of stuff (extra shirt, power supply, loads of stuff), this is the one. It's large, but then so is your computer. The strap and handles are comfortable to use, the case is sporty, and for the price it's a steal."
4,Targus as a computer plus accesory case,The design looks like someone who uses this type of gear for travel. It is well thought out and well made.Targus CityGear Miami Messenger Case for 17 Inch Notebooks TCG200 (Black with Grey)
5,what a deal,"I shopped for two months before finding this case. I have a 17"" laptop and this provides excellent protection and lots of additional room for work product. The fabric is VERY durable. I am now also using it for my additional carry-on item without the computer; it is like having 1 and 1/2 carry-on suitcases."
4,"Thanks Targus, just what I needed!","I travel to europe a few times a year and then between Minnesota and Vegas a few more. Without thinking it through one day I bought an HP 17"" laptop. I really like it except for it's bulk and weight. I actually looked for almost a year before I found this bag and I'm glad I waited. This holds all I need for a day's business. Yes it's big, but somehow it seems to minimize the weight of my laptop. Good on the shoulder and with the strap that attaches it to my carry-on, it has become this road warriors best friend."
4,nice product,"this I model this very well built and very strong, in the specifications that I read, said for laptopd of 15 ""4 but it is for 17"""
5,portable office,"very useful, lots of storage and pockets, fits my 17inch hp perfectly, comes with adjustment spacer for smaller screens. I like the wide shoulder strap. A little padding for the minor bumps of life. Great for storing all your personal electronics together. its like a mini laptop office. Construction is lightweight and adequate for the price. Good for normal use, but if you are a daily commuter and subject to rough environments you might need something sturdier and tougher. Great deal for the average laptop user in need of organizing."
2,Works temporarily,"The product smells great and I followed the instructions. It didn't remove the stains off of the floor or the odor. It did mask the odor, but it was only temporary. I wouldn't recommend this product for floors that have old odors/stains."
2,Bad foam,"The foam was very stiff and did little to cushion my knees. I was attracted by the price and positive reviews, but I will be returning this product."
3,Disappointing,"I'd heard good things about Qiu's first book, Death of a Red Heroine, but was only able to get my hands on his second book, ALCD. I picked it up eagerly, not because I like mystery fiction generally, but I am interested in the political and cultural environment of China. I was surprised to find the book a bit dull. I liked the detailed descriptions about life in china, but I found the characters not particularly interesting and the story kind of pedestrian. Moreover, I found the attraction between Chen and Rohn very grating, but that's prob because I hate romantic stuff in non-romance books. Seemed very hollywood to me. In fact, wouldn't be at all surprised if the book was made into a movie. Anyway, I would still recommend reading the book because it does paint a very interesting portrait of life in china and it's always a good thing to support authors there. If you are interested in reading more chinese authors, check out Mo Yan. Cheers."
5,An enjoyable sequel,"As with Death of a Red Heroine, I enjoyed reading about Chinese culture at the same time that I was reading a good mystery novel. And, even though I'm not a romance fan, I think that Qiu did an excellent job of creating a believable, interesting releationship between the 2 main characters, which added a lot to the story. All of the food/eating references remind me of the exotic sandwiches that Francis X Delaney from The Deadly Sin books by Lawrence Sanders - these little dim sums are wonderful! This is a thoroughly enjoyable read, and I look forward to my 3rd trip to China with Inspector Chen."
4,BOOK BY QIU XIAOLONG,A PEEK AT MODERN CHINA THROUGH THE EYES OF A DETECTIVE AND OF THE POLITICS THAT HE MUST WORK WITH
3,Yummy but small and sweet,"I am a diet bar junkie, my favorite ones are the ones that taste great but leave you full, rather than yearning for another snack 20 minutes later. These ones are quite small (about a 1/3 of a Luna bar) with 120 calories, a gooey caramel filling which is quite chewy, and a chocolate like outer shell. They are quite yummy but just don't taste ""real"" --not worth the 120 calories and they totally don't fill you up, and usually i reach for another snack soon after. If you have 120 calories to waste, just go for some very satisfying chocolate, or a few nuts."
3,How To Be Alone,"Although this book is well written, the title is deceptive. Somehow I missed the main topic, which is dealing with the issue of neurological decline."
4,the funk lives on with the original p,"This is the original p minus george why these guys left p-funk was a long sad story but anyway calvin, ray, grady, and fuzzy got together and proved they can funk without george cliton. This cd is tight if you like funk espescially for the old funk heads you'll find plenty of funk to shake ya booty off."
4,An excellent variety of frightening narratives!,"Not your usual horror recording, which ordinarily consists of some Poe stories or mildly frightening children's tales. The most appealing feature of these selections are the narrators, which include Boris Karloff and Theodore, who sounds convincingly psychotic. Jackie Torrance, known mainly for children's recordings, is also vividly gifted. I would not recommend this collection for children under the age of 12. There are some disturbing aspects to the tales, including death and madness."
1,"very elementary, yet still hard to read","I don't know how Kolman managed to do it, but he did. He wrote a very basic linear algebra text book for beginners and yet made his explanations so unclear that the book ends up being hard to read. The topics are the very basics of linear algebra: no canonical forms, no infinite dimensional spaces, the underlying field is always R or C, and everything is done in terms of matrices. The explanations of the concepts that are covered could use some coherence and a dash of order.I wouldn't recommend this book for anyone. It's pretty much garbage."
2,Bottom line: poorly written,"Th explanations are inadequate. They skip steps. Some elements are added into the chapters that are considered optional. Who ever heard of an optional chapter in their textbook!? I, for one, never heard of such a thing! The problems in the back are not very good usefull and are often repetative in some places and lacking in other. The proofs that the book spends much time with are also poorly explained. The author should know that to the new student, nothing is obvious, nothing is known. There is not more to say than: its a bad book.p.s. I couldn't bring myself to any book only one star."
5,Great!,"This book is really helpful for my PA program classes, especially in the clinical problem solving courses. I highly recommend it!"
2,Keep Looking,"I purchased this CD hoping to replace my vinyl recording of these works by Malgoire, recorded in 1974. That version featured Handel's original Royal Fireworks score for winds and brass only. This CD, recorded in 1986, utilizes the later version which includes strings. Compared to Malgoire's '74 effort, this version lacks power, passion and depth. It is uneven and the ensemble runs through it as though they had been force-fed a strong physic. The Water Music is pedestrian but serviceable; several pieces included on the '74 version are also missing from this one. If, like me, you are looking to replace your old '74 vinyl Malgoire ""Water Music/Fireworks"" with this one....keep looking."
2,Why doesn't Sony release the earlier recordings?,"I'd just like to endorse the comments of ""quidditchqueen"" regarding the early '70s analog recordings by Malgoire of these seminal Handel works. The later ""DDD"" recordings, available on the CD featured here, are serviceable but nothing special. I have never found another recording of ""Music for the Royal Fireworks"" that matches the energy and ecstasy of the c.1974 recording by Malgoire. Perhaps Handel didn't care for the ""no strings"" arrangement of the Fireworks music, but I doubt if he ever heard a performance with the fire of Malgoire's. And the period instruments, including the wonderfully raucous horns (it hardly matters that they're slightly off-pitch at times -- this ain't Mozart), are heard to their best advantage. I am less taken with either recording of the ""Water Music,"" but here too the earlier performance is the better one. Please, oh please, A&R folks at Sony Classics -- put these early '70s performances on CD!!!"
3,"Good, I guess.....",This album is good but it could be a lot better. I enjoy Rozz's work as much as Valor and I would have to say this album is not the best.
4,A true-life adventure story,"I was a little hesitant about reading this book, because it was written in the 1890s and I was afraid that the prose might be tough to slog through. But in fact, the writing style is very readable and the book is a real page-turner. It's almost like a big historical novel, except that it's all true. The author lived a life of high adventure and describes everything that happened to him in clear and dramatic terms. The highlight of the book is the story of crossing Death Valley in 1849 with a small party of emigrants, and nearly dying both from thirst and starvation. Very vivid stuff!"
1,Forgettable plot. Despicable characters,"I read this book at the end of the year, thinking it would be good to read about the end of one millenium at the end of another. Wrong! I particularly disliked this book. It's little of historical fiction, and a lot of surrealism. I even thought it lost in the translation, but by the time I was through, I knew it was simply unlikable. Sometimes it even makes you want to puke."
5,Best dark comedy I've ever seen.... by far.,"I gave this movie five stars not because it is worthy of an Oscar for best picture, but because a good dark comedy is hard to find. Therefore, within the genre it definitely deserves five stars; but if dark dark dark dark dark comedy is not your thing, then take a pass. Otherwise, heed the advice of the reviews that others have posted here and buy this movie (even if it's on VHS)."
4,A great study for right handed fingering,"I teach guitar lessons, and when I studied the guitar I learned from this book. Now I am teaching students 20 years later, and I use this book as well. It is great practice for learning to use the right hand when you play the guitar, not just for classical players, but for all guitarists.I recommend this book to everyone who is learning to play the guitar.As one reviewer wrote there is no tab in this book. The book was written before tab existed. It helps to enforce learning to read music and not just playing along with tab."
3,Alan Sherman sings the greatest vampire song of all time,"""My Son the Vampire"" is the funniest vampire-related song of all-time. It is not as good as ""Monster Mash,"" but that's an imitation of Boris Karloff and he was Frankenstein not Dracula, so there. Some of the other songs are decent, but they are not about vampires. Actually, I would expect a bit more from a Dr. Demento collection. He must have already done the other biggies on another album."
1,space rock to avoid,warning: this is a collection of B-grade space rock (Hawkwind can barely play a chord!) that would drive anyone interested in acid jazz up the wall.
2,NO BATTERY!!!!,"Ok, so I bought this watch for my Dad for his birthday. Little did I know that it would come without a battery! Who sells a watch without a battery?! Really?! Then I had to go through the hassell of going to the store, paying the over-priced jewelry guy for a battery. I haven't had the best experience with this watch...However, once I put a battery in it, it works well and the numbers are nice and big and it's pretty user friendly to figure out which buttons control/set which features."
1,Do Not Buy!!!!!,"Beware! I bought this for the specific reason that it was a digital tuner. I wanted to use this at the gym where they broadcast their TV audio on specific stations. Imagine my disappointment when I tried to use it the first time AND YOU CANNOT SELECT THE FREQUENCY. The only thing this radio allows is for it to ""scan"" and ""lock in"" on a station. The reception was beyond terrible. Avoid at all costs!!!!!"
1,"Repetitive information about ""calling""-- stopped halfway through","I always read books even if they're not that great, but this was so repetitive and used so many examples that illustrated so little that I got so bored and stopped. I didn't learn much of anything from the book; I was hoping to learn to get the most out a job and, in a way, ""whistle while I work."" But the 1st half I read just repeated information about how an inner desire will always call you to something greater (i.e., another job) until you respond. I hope most people already know that."
2,Out Of Date,"The one I have is from 1997. Concepts haven't changed no, but it is really annoying to read some of the numbers they toss out. Like a 700 pair limit electrophoresis, not on today's machines... The language barrier can come through at times, lightly, but still incorrect grammar here and there.Bottom line: old, small, expensive. Fine an alternative."
2,Not a good introduction book,"I do not think it is a good introduction book for biologists to learn computational biology. The authors should have used more figures and examples to illustrate the concepts. Also, I do not like the norrow margins of this book. I like to write comments and my understanding in the books when I read. There is simply no place to write."
2,"Outdated, unrealistic info, a few good activity ideas","I bought this book looking for more easy activity ideas for subbing. I was quite dissappointed. There were only a few pages at the end devoted to activities. The remainder of the book consisted of general sub info, maybe of some worth to someone who is looking to get into the field, with no experience. I've only been subbing a few months and none of this info was helpful. The author conveyed the false sense that all you need to have a good day is a cheery attitude and a ""bag of tricks."" That may work in some classrooms, but not in many I've experienced. In 1983, when the book was published, classrooms were significantly different. Also, the salaries she quotes, after admitting she only polled a few schools to get an ""average,"" were extremely outdated. I make twice the pay she quoted to be on the ""high"" end, and I am being paid low for a sub in my area. I will be returning this book promptly."
3,An adequate short story.,"This tale follows the sad life of timid medical student Deiter Heydrich. Young Deiter comes from a village named Hagenholz (which means hang wood in German), the son of an uncaring father who is a Priest of Morr, to pursue a medical career in the Apothecary's guild in Bogenhafen. After the death of his Mother he vows to learn the arts of medicine and to help prevent death and grieving in the world. However, certain events unfold that will slowly turn the young apprentice to the darker arts."
2,Yikes!,"This woman doesn't have a language problem, she has a Pitch problem with a capital P! Not my kind of a jazz singer."
4,Happy,The people are easy to work with and will contact you about the product and are concerned for their customer satisfaction.
3,"Not Their Best, But Pretty Good","This is a fine debut album by the Monkees. Nesmith's ""Sweet Young Thing"" and Boyce/Harts ""Last Train to Clarksville"" alone make it worth the price. I don't think it is quite as good as some of their later albums such as ""Headquarters"" and ""Pisces, Aquarius..."" when their artistic freedom from Don Kirshner led them to some great music. Some of the Davy Jones stuff gets a little cloying. Still, there is good music, and some fun moments such as ""I'm Gonna Buy Me a Dog"" with comedy bantering between Jones and Dolenz. Worth buying, but I wouldn't make it my first Monkees purchase."
2,Better off dead!,"Listening to the music now after all of these years really shows that the Monkees had no original talent when they were first grouped together. The only one with real talent was Micky Dolenz. All of his songs had a better vocal arrangement and harmonies than the other singers. Davey Jones, well, he should have stuck to the tamborine. I have all the original releases on vinyl. You can easily save yourself money and just download these songs using Kazaa. Stick to some of the real artists of the 60's and 70's and leave the milly vanilly to the amateurs."
2,Prior review correction,"The members of the Monkees sang on this cd, but they didnt play a lick of it. Any talk of this being Monkees music is a pure falsehood."
4,Lagren like early Ernie Ranglin,"Exceptional mastery of guitar jazz expressions. Ought to bemore exposed to the American Jazz public. Great constructionof fluid ideas and scorching phrases.He brings a refreshing taste to the fretboard sice Farlow, Ranglin,Montgomery ans Martino."
3,Smaller than it Looks,"The mistake I made was not realizing their isn't a holder/pocket for water on this bag. This bag is not as large as it looks either. I would recommend it for a kid, but not an adult man."
3,Poor Construction,The soles delaminated on my first long approach to a climb. I have had to re-glue the soles myself 3-4 times. I wrote Five-Ten about the problems I had and never heard back from them. They are very comfortable and the sticky rubber is great for approaches. I just wish they had better construction. I won't buy another pair of these shoes.
4,"Nice shoes, skid marks","I bought these for my husband a few months ago and he LOVES them. He's really hard on shoes, they fall apart all the time, but these have really held up and they look good. The only problem: if you have hardwood or tile floor they leave black marks on the floor that are hard to get off. Other than that, a really nice shoe."
2,Too Many Tools Needed,"Things I didn't like about this video:-You need too many tools - hand weights, a strechy band, a chair, and a yoga ball. This isn't mentioned on the Amazon description. You don't find this out until you go to do the workout.-A partner is used in the video - not practical. They say you can use a door frame or bedpost but I don't have those near my dvd player.-It is only for the first 2 trimesters. No workouts given for the 3rd trimester.-Not enough leg workout.-Time is deceptive. If you do the warm-up, workout, and cool down it takes you more than 15 minutes.What I liked:-Good upper body workout (if you have all the tools)."
1,Not alone!,"The trainer in this video helps Gabrielle with everything. While you are at home with no one to help. He also tells you after you get on the ground you might need to stabilize the ball? He holds the chair for Gabrielle and hands her everything, holds the ball stable for her. This is not a do it yourself at home video. Also why not just put a warm up and cool down at the beginning and end of every month? It was a waste of time and money!"
1,Not worth the money,"I bought this when I was almost 6 months pregnant, not realizing that it only gives workouts for the first and second trimester. Mostly my fault because I should've known I can't workout too much towards the end... but I really didn't like that for all the workouts, you need different equipment. You need weights, a stretch band, and an exercise ball. Make sure you have all the equipment before you start. Basically, I have no use for this DVD now."
4,Good inspiration,"The exercises were great. Unfortunately the exercises only went through the second trimester. You will also need weights, a ball and those bungy exercise cords (can't remember their exact name)."
3,great price,this book is alittle dry and boring but when you need it for a class you do what you got to do. the price was also great comnpared to the book store and fast shipping.
5,The Chosen a 5 star experience,"There are so many people out there who are either contemplating giving thier lives to Christ or are newly saved and are wondering what their next step is.I beleive that the book ""The Chosen"" clearly explains the 4 A's in your walk with Christ. I have been unable to find another book that answers those questions.As you read the book you feel like God and Prophetess Mangum are sitting down with you having a conversation. When a question arises in your mind, the next sentence is the answer!!!I would recommend this book to the young in Christ and those who have been in Christ for years.If you or someone you know have questions about what happens after you say ""I do"" with God ""The Chosen"" is the book for you."
1,Thick English Accents,"Do not buy this movie. It was made by the Britains and they used all English actors who all speak with thick british/Cockney Engish accents. I couldn't understand a word of what they said. Not only the accents, but the words they use in Britain that we are unfamiliar with in the USA. I had to have subtitles throughout the entire movie. Additionally, it was made with a budget of only 4 million pounds. Not a very good movie or story and impossible to understand because of the accents."
2,"Watch ""Carlito's Way"" instead","This movie is a bad ripoff of ""Carlito's Way.""Watch that instead. It's far more engaging and entertaining.I agree with others that the plot was hard to follow and the actors talk with a heavy British accent that is sometimes difficult to understand."
4,Daniel Craig forever!,I enjoyed the flick as I enjoy the Daniel Craig in anything! Only problem were the British accents. They were heavier that I usually here in British flicke.
4,"Smart, Stylish and Realistic","The DVD case for Layer Cake chose to use a review which said ""Hilarious!"" in big, bold letters, probably trying to convince people that this film was similar to Snatch and Lock, Stock and Two Smoking Barrels. This couldn't be farther from the truth, though, because this movie never tries to be funny. Instead of a tongue-in-cheek British crime comedy, this movie tries to show a realistic view of the various forms of underground crime in London. The characters are gritty and human, the dialogue is snappy, and instead of random violence right and left with no consequences to show for it, every shooting, knifing and other killing in this film has a profound effect on the characters, who actually show remorse, nervousness and other honest emotions.Layer Cake will definitely appeal to fans of the aforementioned films, but don't expect a zany comedy. Instead, enjoy this smart, gritty and realistic crime drama with its powerful acting and realistic storyline."
4,"TOP OF THE WORLD, MA","Traditional gangster film with a modern British spin. Drug kingpin advances to the top of the trafficking 'layer cake' of drug smuggling, and believes he will be able to retire in multi-millionaire comfort. There's just one more job to do. While all the familiar gangster themes are here; heads packed in ice, double crosses, pistol wielding maniacs, the film boasts a realism that reveals the upper income underworld with little pretension, and not a godfather in sight. The entire organization is nearly brought down by the hot potato 'big score', - one million hits of the club drug Ecstasy, a loot, I would assume, no self respecting murderous drug smuggler would be left holding in a bust. It all makes for an intriguing and entertaining gangster film; these characters could be the grandsons of 'Goodfellas'. It's no wonder the cool, controlled Daniel Craig, as the accomplished and independent anti-hero, has just signed to be the new James Bond."
2,"A social commentary, not a reassurance","I bought this book in the middle of some very difficult decisions whether to have an amniocentisis following a positive MSAFP. The premise, that for many women pregnancy is tentative for the first trimester because of fear of miscarriage and for the second trimester because of fear of negative results from the amnio really fits my experience. I was hoping this book would provide some validation and reassurance. It didn't. It is very much a social commentary which subtly criticizes women for wanting to control whether or not to bear a child with a disability or fatal deformity. I was hoping to have some validation of my experience, and instead I felt judged and criticized."
4,Awesome!,"The title says it: this will leave you in awe. Although at first a little confusing, Juvinile Orion is an addictive manga with, might I add, beautyful art. Although at the beginning i tis rather confusing, things slowly begin to fall into place. Overall, i highly recomend this for those of you who are looking for something interesting and new to add to your manga collection."
3,Pretty good,"To be honest, I thought that Aquarian Age could have been better. True, the art was beautiful (with plenty of bishonen to boot) but I felt that the story was a bit choppy. However, it was still interesting enough to keep the reader flipping the pages, even though its was a bit like X/1999 (which is better by the way)...my main issue was that the main character, Mana, seemed like all the other main shoujo characters. But that is just my personal opinion. Overall, I think that Aquarian Age is a good buy if you have some extra cash or something, but definately not a must-have."
4,"Basic Cable, 2XLR to 3.5mm jack.","It is what it says. The only reason I didn't give it 5 starts is because the connection between the metal and rubber of the XLR end seems like it could be a bit fragile. So just make sure when you're unplugging the XLR side you grab the metal and not the rubber. It hasn't come apart yet and everything sounds fine, but it's just something I've noticed.Other than that great cable, great price, on-time shipping. Good job HOSA."
4,"LOVE IT! Functional, Easy to Clean!!!!!!!!!!","I am the mother of 3, my youngest is 7 months old. I have already thrown out 2 booster strap-on seats and one Graco highchair. The one thing I HATE about high chairs is that they get so darn filthy!! (Food gets trapped in the straps, folds, etc.) I must say the BOON one is extremely well built and VERY easy to clean. It is all one piece with no seams or crevices, so it just wipes clean in a jiffy. It rolls easily around the kitchen and is extremely sturdy. The one thing I would change is that the center bar between the child's legs should be a little further out from the child's groin area to give them more room. Other than that, this high chair is BY FAR the best I have seen on the market."
2,Not a Fan,"This high chair looks cool, but that is about the best part of it. It is horribly uncomfortable because it doesnt recline, my child screamed when I put her in it. The idea is terrific, the whole easy to clean and push a button to raise it but not comfortable at all. Returned it right after i put it together."
5,Don't miss! It's the best i've ever .....,"It's not need a word. Just Enjoy,and then you'll see it .His voice is very gentle. the music is the best. Recording is very loud. Just Enjoy.""My life for a song"" is the best.I love his Otello then i listen to these songs, just like he is happy . and i'm very happy.I love you Mr.Domingo."
2,Not much useful when comparing with other com book,"When comparing with books like 'inside com' & 'Beginning ATL com', I found this book is hard to follow. Although sometimes it provides some few good insight, it can't clearly explain the detail's of COM and the chapters are not very well organized."
5,The best book on COM available,Tough reading but by far and away the best and most complete COM guide available.
5,THE only COM book you will ever need.,"I found this book a breath of fresh air when it comes to explaining what is probably best described as a difficult subject. Don starts with the fundamentals and really hits the nail on the head in explaining COM without worrying about going into the various implementation libraries that are out there (the main on being ATL of course). I program using ATL, and now I feel that I understand what is going on. An absolute must for all COM programmers."
3,this book really is overcredited,"Yes, the book gets its job done. Once you are done reading this book, you will know COM quite well. However, this really is not for beginners. Unless you have a good idea on how COM works, you will be lost. I have read ""Inside COM"" before reading this book, and I was still somewhat lost(its that confusing). If you know how COM works, this book will lead you to more technical background and help you truly understand how COM works, but, things are not clearly written. The author expects you know COM quite well."
3,"Useful for filling in the blanks, but not a summary of COM.","Worth reading--will probably fill some holes in your COM knowledge. Box wants to ground programmers in the theory, but goes too far in his academic approach to the material. Combine this with a more hands-on COM book e.g. David Platt."
3,Useful for advanced Turkish,"Very good for more advanced Turkish conversations. The book is VERY heavy and large, so it's not a take-along book unless you're going to Turkey to study the language."
1,Just not that good,"Susan Peach is unclear, hard to follow, boring and stumpy. I felt like i was stomping around stupidly for hours. Its not fun at all. I love Mambo dance and this DVD made me feel like an elephant, or like I would end up with elephant legs. I hate this DVD."
4,Hours of entertainment,My 6 year old and my 9 year old both like this game. They have played it for hours and it still works like new.
3,Seen it all before,"This is basically a rehash of another book that I reviewed for Amazon--The Encyclopedia of the World's Special Forces.The book has information on operations carried out in Iraq & Afghanistan, as well as informaton on Special Operation Forces from around the world, as well as a look at the soldiers of the future.The major disappointment for me as far as this book goes, is that unlike the previous tome, it says nothing about counter terrorist or hostage rescue unitsAll in all, not bad for the price, but there are better books out there."
2,disappointed,the quality of sound and arrangements are not to par to the other cds by this great choir. i was disappointed...i kept skipping to the next song.
2,"Definitely NOT a good book to ""learn"" asp.net","Don't buy this book if you're looking to learn asp.net. It won't do you much good. It's a good reference once you get some of the basics down, but this book is terrible at walking you through even some of the beginning level stuff. There's definitely a reason that this is the professional book. I guess I just figured it would be enough with the several years or asp experience I had. But there's no way you could develop an asp.net application if this was the first and only book you read.Great reference but only later on. Don't believe the section on the back ""who is this book for""? It's not for asp 3.0 developers looking to learn asp.net. It's for people who have already read another book and learned asp.net but are trying to find out what some of the more advanced stuff available is."
2,Badly out-dated today.,This was a good book back in 2001 because there wasn't much available. It is more than useless now. There are loads of typos and the code techniques used are not best practice. Don't even think of getting it 2nd-hand at a bargain price; better get a later edition.
3,Poorly Organised and Executed,"The subject of this book is obviously very fresh and all new texts will offer a useful insight into the platform. This book gives you several ideas on ways to restructure your existing ASP apps and potentially write new ASP.NET apps. However the downside to this book is the poor examples. In other Wrox books you build the example code so that you understand it, but with this book, you download it (it doesn't always work) and the authors dive right into it. Too many times you spend alot of effort going over the downloaded code trying to figure out what is going on before you get back to the book or you end up not understanding why things work nor how to repeat them.Overall, the topic is great, but the book could be better."
4,A Great Reference,"Most of the .NET stuff to come out so far has been either a lot of fluff, or just redistribution of existing MSDN articles (with the exception of Introducing Microsoft .NET).Professional ASP.NET takes off where Programming Active Server Pages+ left off. This book is over 1000 pages of details for everything .NET.No, there isn't a C# section, but if you want to know about the GAC, how the CLR works, security, caching, and even the ASP.NET syntax, this is a great book.You'll find that this servers more than just an introduction. I use it as a reference book now for topics that I didn't get into on the first read."
5,WA Penlamp,Excellent product as always. Light is very bright . Bought this lamp as a replacement and I have always had a very good experience with this particular model.
4,A testament to the author's family,i bought the book because i wanted to know more about the author's mother whose paintings I own.It is also a great book to come to grips with one's mortality and end of life issues.
3,"Enlightening, but loooooooooooooooooooooooooooong!","A fable that made me think! Though I think it's way too long. Could have been much shorter had the author been just a little less descriptive. Too much is too much. Also he uses Hindu words like ""Naniji"" and ""Dhol"" which he never explains. I had to look these words up on the net! Which is upsetting. Other than that it makes you reflect on the harried nature of our lives and what's really amusing is the way the 'Warhogians' speak. They speak in 'Wise old sayings' which they memorize without ever understanding, or which they say and then do its opposite. I think I know about a dozen or so people like that! It's a good laugh."
4,Doggie Bowl,I really like this bowl. The only thing is that I thought it was higher from the ground than it is.
5,Burroughs is far better than the Tarzan movies,"Despite an enthusiastic recommendation from my grammar school principal (and, later, superintendent of the school system for which I taught), it took me over 50 years to follow through on his recommendation. Yes, although I was no fan of the movies, the books are quite well written and entertaining. The collection is well worth checking out despite your qualms."
4,Publisher and publication date in error above,"This short 26-page book is a review fish oil research as of the end of 1986. The publisher is Keats Publishing Co and the copyright date is 1987.Although Amazon's bibliographic data shows a different publisher and a much newer publication date, you can browse through the scanned copy here on Amazon and get the correct information from the copyright page.Amazon lists Dr Passwater as the author of 40 books, although many, like this one, are updates of earlier works. Most are related to specific nutritional supplements.The book is what it is - a four-star report of fish oil research as of 1986. Passwater draws conclusions from the research that are positive for fish oil as a nutritional additive."
1,Watch out-battery expired only after two years,My original battery that came with my opthalmoscope lasted about 10 years. The one I received from this company's expiration date was only two years. It didn't work that well to begin with.I called Welch Allyn and they are sending me a battery free of charge.
1,Could have been good...but,"Definitely not for a general audience, this work is quite vulgar. With no shortage of obscene language, and child sex in the opening story, this cannot honestly be called an anthology, and is by no means exemplary of the dynamic culture with is African-America."
5,love it!,i have been using this conditioner for a while now and have actually just ordered some more to keep-or even share :)my husband loves the smell and i love the feel!for the price-it's worth the buy.
3,So-So,Great concept however dish is too shallow. My cats pulled the grass out by the roots. I have one more pod so I will try again and see if I get better results.
1,A WASTE,"Don't waste your money. You may get a ""good"" batch of seeds. I didn't. Only 2 sections grew anything at all then died in a couple days. Moldy and buggy too."
1,Worthless,"What a waste of money. Can buy five of these at grocery store already fully grown and they last at least a week. For $10 this is a rip off. Seeds must be old. Grows in very thinly, cat can't be bothered to pick up one or two strands of the ""grass."" The are only $2 fully grown at supermarket. Save yourself the cost and buy the already grown from the market."
5,Awesome T-shirt,Without question the best $7.89 t-shirt out there. I originally purchased four and will be purchasing four more if they ever get anymore in stock. The shirt feels silk-like and wicks away moisture better then the under-armour shirt I paid $22.00.
1,Disappointing second for Donna Andrews,"I so much enjoyed ""Murder with Peacocks"" that I had high hopes for ""Puffins,"" but was disappointed from top to bottom. It was a meandering, plotless story, lacking utterly in the humor, romance, excitement, and pace of the first. The characters were as drab as the setting. The writing felt self-conscious; the dilemmas were tepid; worst of all, Michael totally lost his spark. He was not believable as a male -- or even as much of a person. Pretty much a sidekick dishrag. He was so endearing in ""Peacocks!"" I only bothered to finish it because I was up feeding the baby anyway. Was this a rush job? And the attemps to ""puffinize"" the book with cutesy puffin titles were embarrassing."
4,Meg Langslow Mysteries,"So far I have read 5 of these mysteries. I have liked the ones I have read. I enjoyed the thrill of the problem solving and the ""who done it"" type of mystery."
2,Two Stars,"I really like Donna Andrew's ""bird series."" However, I gave up reading Murder with Puffins 2/3 of the way through ; it was too grey. The weather was grey, the houses were grey, the character development and interaction were grey. I found myself rooting for the hurricane to wipe out the town, especially the bird watchers; this is not a good sign. I sincerely recommend Murder by Peacocks and Revenge of the Wrought-Iron Flamings, but I would fly right over this book."
3,"Entertaining, but Slow-Paced.","This is the first novel that I've read by Donna Andrews. With the title, ""Murder by Puffins"", I thought this would be a quirky mystery book that was right up my alley. The premise of the book was intriguing. Meg and her boyfriend believe that they are off to a secluded lovers getaway on an island off the coast of Maine. They soon become embroiled in a local scandal and mystery. I have to admit I was somewhat disappointed when the mystery was solved. It was a moment of ""Is that it?"". Perhaps I should start off with Ms. Andrews' first book. This one I found to be slow and lacked excitement"
1,Written by a throwback to the uneducated days of gambling,"I found the book utterly unreadable, I have read many blackjack books and have enjoyed most of them. I have always leaned towards the authors with a more technical background but I have also enjoyed Silberstang's work because of his wealth of blackjack playing experience. Mr Patrick writes like a clown and even brags about his ignorance of computers and their use in basic strategy construction. His book is a defintie throwback to the days before computer and statistical research"
3,"not good, not bad, just typical","it's too bad tracks 2 and 4 start with the same overdone little riff, really, it's terrible, but, tracks 1 and 3 are pretty cool, mellow, have that cool beat that compiment a dark room with clove cigarettes and b&b. (track 7, dark-sounding, kinda cool) overall the cd is allright, which I guess is what you can expect from any cd nowadays, a few really good tracks, but a pile of mediocre nonsence, one of which the voice of mr. melbourne made me cringe (tr 8). melbourne is on the same type plane as pj harvey and morcheeba, so if you're into those types, it's worth a listen. only other criticism is the overuse/misuse of electronics and funny little drum machines."
5,"Very nice, but Very heavy","I got this set back in September of 2006 as a present to myself, and find it VERY nice over all--things cook very evenly. No problems with cleaning, or things burning on, or what not, as long as I use cooking spray as needed. I love the feel of the pans, and the handles take a very long time to heat up, so I can usually pick them up without a potholder.The one downside for me is the wieght of the pots. I had hand surgery in February, and it took almost 6 weeks for me to be able to lift a pot with water in it! I was able to lift my mother's pots and pans within a week or so--these weigh quite a bit more than anything I had used in the past."
5,Beautiful memories,"I bought this because our church, like many these days, doesn't have an organ or choir. The music is all electronic, read off a video screen in the front -- most of the time I don't even try to follow along to sing those unfamiliar songs. I miss the hymnals and music I grew up with and this album brings that all back in my memory. [Of course the Mormon Tabernacle Choir is the best!]"
1,Not a Very Good Product,"This is a first generation head protector that lacks refinement. It is very uncomfortable to wear, especially in warm weather. It does not ventilate at all. The ability to head the ball is very limited, due to the padding and seams on the forehead that actually hurts the head when the ball is contacted. This needs to be vastly improved to be effective, useful and widely used in sports. It is a good first step, but the vinyl used does not breathe. This also cost nothing to produce, and to sell a little bit of vinyl and padding for $30 is ripping off people that are desperate after they suffer a concussion. This product does not have any properties that can be proven to reduce further head injuries as well. No research has been done to prove that this head gear does anything at all."
4,Solid and sort of true,"The college days came rolling back, although it had only been about three years. Most of the descriptions and antics are still so true today, which makes the backdrop for the book such an interesting nostalgia read for somebody just out of college. Although not Yale.This was my first Perrotta novel, and though some of the criticism is harsh, I found the narrator somewhat interesting even if a bit unrealistic. How many things can bounce off one person without him even getting the remote hint of responsibility?People like Danny, the main character, are people you love to hate. He is almost of a reverse-case scenario to the silver-spooned Yalie. He had a working-class upbrining but in the end proved to be as spoiled as they come.Maybe it was the spite that kept me reading this book and highly entertained at the same time."
5,the best instrumental christmas music,"this music cd is something to be treasured it is a must have for christmas song lovers. it is relaxing and while you listen to it ,you'll feel the spirit of christmas so i recommend this for those who love christmas."
3,Coffee table reading for air enthusiasts,"This volume is a good mix of detailed history and other information on USAF fighter and attack aircraft of the 1960s thorugh 1980s (A-10, F-15, F-16, F-18, etc.) along with some rather sketchy data on late-model Soviet craft and stealth craft. The photos of the Soviet craft are particularly disappointing; most of them look like long-range surveillance photos shot in the Soviet era rather than the clear views seen at major air shows in the last decade.As a definitive reference it falls short, but as an enjoyable read for buffs, it's a good value. I bought a copy for an aviation-obsessed nephew, and he's mad about it. Owners of more complete and detailed libraries might be more subdued in their enthusiasm."
2,"Hardly ""up-to-date""",I was really looking forward to reading this book but when I recieved it i was greatly disappointed. Most of the material is from the first edition which is at least ten to fifteen years old. Coverage of new planes like the B-2 is really poor. The section on Russian planes features old photos like the ones from books in the 70's and 80's. Monthly or weekly aviation magazines like Air International have far more professional and up-to-date coverage.
2,"Okay food, inadequate quality control.","Natural Balance needs to improve their quality control! A few months ago I opened a can of the Venison & Green Pea canned food and found a piece of flexible plastic cooked into their food. Needless to say I was surprised and notified the manufacturer immediately and sent the can back to them (at their request); they assured me that they have the highest standard of quality control and that this would not happen again. I was given a replacement can as well as coupons and an apology for the incident. I continued to feed them the canned Vension & Green Pea, but lo and behold, a few months later and we're experiencing the same thing! This time there was a big piece of green plastic in the canned food. I will be notifying the manufacturer again and sending the can back to them as before (hopefully they can test to see exactly what happened), and I will no longer be using this product."
3,Good begining Sailor's Handbook.,"Good beginner reference, weather resistant plastic coated boards.Covers basic sailboat and sailing information. Would be handy to have aboard for novice skipper to learn terms like luff, clew and foot. Book is illustrated with many clear drawings and photographs. Reviews basic sailing terminology, has section depicting most common marine Knots.I added it to my library because ""Herreshoff "" was the consulting editor. Would highly recommend begining sailors first read ""Royces Sailing Illustrated"" ISBN:0894716964."
2,Not for beginners,"I have extensive knowledge of HTML, forms, and some programming (mostly VB). I was completely lost from the get-go. There is nothing in the book about HOW to write a cgi-script (use an editor or use VI?). Nor did it say how to FTP. I believe that the book would have been a lot better if it stuck to PERL and how to program and implement programs instead of worrying about the history. More working scripts would have been nice."
4,Beginner's Comment,"This book is very good for beginner like me. The author had explained verry wellhow the CGI scripts work and what are the importent of each CGI scripts.He directed me how to cunstruct CGI application with efficeincy.Thank Eric, I learn lot of stuff by reading your book."
3,This a good book BUT not for the beginners.,"This book covers wide range of CGI topics. It is a goodsecond book for those who already know the basics of CGIetc., and want to learn a bit more on things such as how toapply real PERL tricks to it. However, the material isnot organized in a way suitable for a 'Teach Yourself' onefor the beginners . Novice reader will quickly get lostin the 'forest', without clear indications as to what arethe basic structural features of CGI."
5,Best CGI-book I've ever read!!!,"This book by Eric Herrmann, is the best toturial book I've ever read. Not only does Eric's humor turn out to be fantastic throughout the book (for me thats the positive sides to reading). I was a newbie to PERL and CGI-scripting, and after reading his book (In under a week!!! - comment to other reviewers) I found myself programming CGI-scripts. So this book I would recommend to other fellow student arround the world who is willingly to read a fun and interresting book. Perhaps other reader's seem to forget that the book is for newbies, and not for experienced programmers (hence the word ""teach yourself"" which is my oppinion reaches out for non-experienced programmers!). Hope you write more like this, and don't let some readers go to your head!..."
2,Not recommended,"This might be a good book if you already know Perl, but if you don't know it before reading this, you won't know it after. This is really more a CGI book than a PERL book, and it's only for UNIX users. It's also disorganized and repetitive."
1,Many examples not included in either the book or on the CD,"I found some useful information in this book but way too many examples are missing. For example, in Chapter 7 you build a form which posts to a non-existent CGI program. There is no indication anywhere to explain what this missing CGI does.There are no updated files on the publisher's website so you're just stuck.Don't waste your money on this book."
4,This book would benifit greatly by inhanced detail.,"CGI programming in a week? More like a month for us non-programming, just got here, what's going on types. The explanations are excellent, but very little mention is made about implementing the code leaving the novice in the dark. What good is wonderfully explained code if you have no idea how to actually make it work? Good Luck!"
3,Charming,"Not a bad collection, with three solid episodes of an old favorite. The episode where Lassie gets hit by a car is particularly heartwarming."
1,More bad Ratt,"Ratt have found a new way to pollute the world and thats a video collection! Relive the memories of cheese and bad haircuts and guys in girl makeup.It does crack me up Stephen Pearcy has failed to release a live album since he can't hold a note to save his life.If you want to cure insomnia, I""m afraid this will give you nightmares. A great christmas grab bag gift for the ones you hate!"
5,Welcome to Reality,"Marc Parent is a social worker in New York City. His job is to make sure children that are getting abused are removed from their home and placed into better ones. He takes us with him to the tradgic and horrible places where most of society tries to avoid. He deals with drunken mothers who rely on their eleven-year-olds to take care of them to a child who wants to kill his little brother because he can't control him while his mother is away. He begins to doubt himself on whether removal is always the solution until one day a child dies. The blame is placed elsewhere, but Marc Parent believes differently. The book opened my eyes to things I didn't want to know or hear about, but glad I did."
4,Turning Stone,"""Turning Stones"" by Mark Parent is an outstanding book that captures the readers attention from the beginning. After Parent gains his readers attention he begins to captivate his audience with an inside look into his life as an Emergency Children's Services worker. The reader is brought into the homes of families to decide whether or not the children should remain with their parents or be removed, deeming the living environment as being unfit for the children. Parent is also able to bring the reader into the true situation with his first person narrative of the his many encounters inside five of New York boroughs. He displays to the reader his uncanny ability to relate to children with a vast array of backgrounds and upbringings. ""Turning Stones"" has the power to change peoples' entire outlook on how the world can unfold right beneath their eyes. Without a doubt, this page turner will remain amidst the top of the charts for years to come. By J R Berg"
4,turning stones,"Marc Parent shows the truth about Emergency Children's Services. Parent tells of the struggles and pain that many children go through day in and day out. He tells of the long hours that the EMC put in everyday. Parent moves people with this book by telling exactly what the children are thinking and what actually happens to them. ""Turning Stones"" is a must read!MA"
4,Excellent Book,"Reading this book gave me a new repect for the people that work with Human Resources and Social Services. I can see now why the Social Service field needs so many people to help protect our children from harm. Marc Parent does an excellent job in using description to bring us closer to the child in whom he was trying to protect. When Parent talks about the children under ""The Hex"", it really made me wonder how many people believe that they are under some sort of hex. He tries in all of his cases not to remove the children. I really enjoyed this book. There were times that it got hard to read, the emotion that I felt was too much. I remember thinking, ""How could anyone do this to their children."" I would recomend this book for anyone who is thinking about doing Social Service work, anything related to the field or for your own information."
5,Excellent book,"Excellent book, my copies keep disappearing; so I'm on my third order. Excellent book, my copies keep disappearing; so I'm on my third order."
4,"Sounds good, looks cheap","I received the Sony CMT-NEZ3 as a gift from my company (service award) I put it in the bedroom. Sound is pretty good but it looks cheap. I would not have it in the living room or anywhere people would see it. I also have a Bose Wave radio which sounds much, much better. The CMT-NEZ3 seems to be a fairly good unit for under $100.00."
3,It's a thermostat kit...,"Not much to review here, its a thermostat and gaskets.I did find out that the Thermostat housing gasket in this kit was not the right one for my app, even though it says it is. Mine required the gasket that has the rivets in it. Other than that it seems ok."
4,Shadows and Songs,"The shadowy trail on the sale of this rough mix from a 1978 concert date in Boston makes it a highly-coveted collectible for progressive rock fans. Released in April 1999, the CD was ""withdrawn"" from the marketplace due to a legal dispute between band members and the record company that sold the concert tape to another label.This is the original group - Allan Holdsworth, Eddie Jobson, John Wetton, Bill Bruford - during the critically-acclaimed tour to support its debut album, with the North American dates played in clubs and small halls. Holdsworth and Bruford left the group soon after the completion of the tour.Due to the lack of live material issued by the band, this is a gem of a find, though the sound quality parallels the history of how the tape went from a vault to being very briefly an ""official"" chronicle of a remarkable supergroup."
3,Good creative fun,"One has to admire the artistic freedom inherent here. As this reissue's good liner notes explain, the Monkees were by now working separately from one another with producers and session men, putting together basically whatever they wanted to. Needless to say, we get an eclectic result. There are legitimate big hits by great songwriters, ""Daydream Believer"" and ""Valleri."" Then there are times you wonder with a laugh, ""what in the *hell* am I listening to?"" All in all it's fun, and the outtakes are of interest."
5,"beautiful music, musicianship","these weiss recordings by lutz kirchhof (and the parallel series recorded by robert barto) provide a beautiful and unexpectedly poignant taste of the late baroque. the lutes in both series have a splendid tone, resonant and bright, and the recordings are close (20 bit technology is used) without being too detailed. the pieces are played with nary a buzz or flubbed note and with stunning rhythmic momentum and verve. (kirchhof once or twice pops a string in his enthusiasm.) the various suites by weiss are not strongly contrasted musically -- all are built around similar harmonic progressions and motifs, developed as arpeggiated chords and free scales -- and all the discs in the barto and kirchhof series are delightful: the music is gently propulsive, endlessly evolving, wistful, joyful, reflective and dancing by turns. the whole series is highly recommended."
2,Not very practical,"The book is thick, and god only knows why! I have been preparing for the Oracle Certification exam. Numerous times I have tried looking up parameter definitions, and they are not to be found in the index! Try licking through all the pages!For example, the book is very convoluted about steps required to set up a spanking new database, along with a pool of users. Nowhere does it delineates ALL the steps. Granted I may know that after wading through all the chapters, but try doing that with a finite project deadline...Save your money and buy a better book."
2,Not for Experienced DBAs,I bought this book and Oracle 8 DBA book and found they are not for experienced DBAs. I did not find much new information in these books. I found cram exam books on OCP-DBA Upgrade from Oracle 7.3 to Oracle 8 and Oracle 8 to Oracle 8i much useful.This book will probably good for people who just became DBA.
5,Taffy's done it again!,"Taffy's done it again! She is blackmailing Jana Morgan, who she thinks stole a teacher's wallet! This book teaches an important lesson about honesty, and the consequences of lying!"
5,Best Monkees Album,"Even though many regard Headquarters as the Monkees' best album, I like this album better. Headquarters is a great album, don't get me wrong. But Pisces is more innovative. Almost every song here has its value and is pleasing to listen to. The only songs here I don't like are ""Hard To Believe,"" and the overblown ""Star Collector."" This is pure psychedellia, Monkees-style!"
3,Interesting sounds,"The Monkees finally had the creative freedom to do their own thing - each one did do his own thing, and the results are a pretty far-out mash of fascinating effects and not-so-memorable songs, except for the hit ""Pleasant Valley Sunday."" Lots of fun, though."
5,"The greatest of The Monkees's albums, and a masterpiece in its own right....","This is not only The Monkees's best album, it's also a great album completely on its own. Too often The Monkees (as others have said here) get trashed by the establishment. Here they showed that they actually had talent, and made their most consistent and greatest album. There are many great, great songs here, including Cuddly Toy, the intense Words, the country pop masterpiece What Am I Doing Hanging Around?, and the pyschedelic (and brilliant) Daily Nightly (penned by Mike Nesmith). It also has one of their most underrated pop singles, Pleasant Valley Sunday. If you take away the fact that The Monkees were originally a band made up by record executives just to create an American Beatles, they still made great music and this album should prove that they were excellent musicians in their own right. I play this album a lot, and it keeps improving everytime I play it."
2,Not what I was looking for,"I am getting ready to create some online training courses and bought several books to review and this book was one of the least helpful to me. I might have found it more useful if I was in an institutional environment which appears to be the intended audience. There is a great deal of theory and discussion here, but not a lot of practical information. I also didn't find the writing style very engaging and lost focus many times.If you are looking for more real, hands-on information, I highly recommend E-Learning by Design by William Horton which I found covered most of the topics discussed here in a more engaging and useful manner."
2,"If you are after the music, don't get this one......","but if you are after the history, and more about the life of Nusrat Fateh Ali Khan, it is worthwhile. There are only snippets of his concert performances (really only one in particular) which as a whole, make this DVD fall far short of what I was looking for......"
3,"Lackluster, but OK","The reviews on the back of this video's box would make you think you are about to see something like ""American Masters,"" an intelligent, well-produced examination of Nusrat's life and his artistic impact upon the world. Instead, the production is less than excellent, the history is slightly innacurate (Qawwali is NOT ""Sufi music,"" but music performed by only a few Sufi groups in Southern Asia, not the entirety of sufism in the Islamic world). However, interviews with his various collaborators (Michael Brook) and samplers (Bally Sagoo) proved interesting, but not too essential. As far as the music is concerned, you're constantly teased by snippets of ""Allah Hoo"" and ""Dam Mast Qalandar,"" but for the most part the soundtrack seems dominated by one or two songs played over and over ad naseum. Purchase this video only if you're a Nusrat completist. Better yet, just go rent it."
1,Skip This One,The 1 star says it all. This video is only of interest to fans who like his raw un-westernized music. This DVD did nothing for me.
3,Eats batteries,"Good sound for a small boombox but potential buyers should be aware that battery life is very short. Six Energizer size ""D"" batteries will only power the system for about 5 hours! The user guide says 7 hours but we have not found that to be true after 3 sets of batteries. Not a problem if the unit is plugged in but we bought it to use outside."
3,67% satisfied,"I have purchased 6 of these players for use in a childcare setting in the past year. The CD player on 2 have already broken and in niether case was able to send them in under the warranty. Taking into account that they are in use here approx 50 hours/week; they are pretty durable. However, they are not as indestructable as I needed them to be for the price."
4,Sound is pleasing,The radio reception is excellent--I pick up public radio about 30 miles from the broadcasting tower. The CD & tape player all work well. Sound is pleasing. My only tiny complaint is that the buttons to play the tape are confusing.
1,Ate the Cassette Tape=Sony CFD S350 Boombox,"On the first day, it ate and destroyed a cassette tape, and it was a VERY important one. I couldn't get the tape out of the machine withOUT breaking the tape. Be very careful, and make sure you have duplicates of your tapes before you let this machine eat it!"
1,Bad buy,"In the last five years, Sony leads the industry in customer complaints and this product is in line with Sony's poor performance. The distortion level is so acute that it's impossible to enjoy a cassette, the CD does only slightly better. One wonders how anybody who likes music could be satisfied with this product. However, it is good for listening to news, and talk radio. The AM and FM reception is really good. But this one's not for anyone who likes music, even a child will be unhappy with it. Plus, the buttons are so poorly made that they fall off if you aren't careful."
1,"Cheaply made, threw it in the garbage","I bought one of these a while back for work on construction sites. Had it a little over a year or so until the buttons pushed down into the radio & wouldn't work at all. In good faith, I bought another one; same thing except this time, the volume would go all the way up as soon as it was turned on. I could only use the remote since the buttons broke but the volume still went right back to full blast. total garbage unless you mostly use the remote and don't move it around much. ....oh, the cd lid was tricky to push down without almost breaking it....."
4,Last of the CD/Cassette Portables,I was looking for a replacement portable Radio/CD/cassette player for my old one that had died. I was suprised to find that there aren't many of these portables still being offered. This one is was a good choice. It does everything well. A nice plus is the remote. The sound is good for a couple of cheap 4 inch speakers driven with a few watts from an amplifier chip which it what you find in just about all if these type of portables. Bang for the buck is very good.
3,Obituary of a CD Player,"As a music teacher, I use my classroom CD player all day. Sony is a great company, so I trusted this one would last. The volume would go louder than other small boom-boxes, but not quite loud enough for my 26-person classes. It lasted about 7 months.Now when I try to use it, it acts like the CD is skipping, even new CDs. Perhaps it needs to be repaired? Either way, I'm disappointed in Sony."
2,Weak cassette movement,The movement of the cassette tape is too slow. It gets weaker toward the end of the reel.
3,It's Okay,The boombox is okay but I'm afraid it'll break in no time if I'm not careful with the CD component. The part that comes down on the CD seems loose and have to be very careful when playing the discs.F.Y.I. You can't play recordable discs or bootlegs on there. So that sucked
2,Poor FM and NO bass,"This looks like a nice unit but has no low frequency at all. As other reviewers say Mega Bass does almost nothing. Also it could not pick up local high power stations with serious hiss.The CD & cassette had clean sound, but NO low end.I returned this one. Not worth it."
1,Sony loses my loyalty,"I've had many Sony products in the past and thought they were great. I wonder if the ""modern"" Sony has given up their high quality standards that got them their good reputation.None of the push buttons on this ""thing"" have worked properly since soon after I purchased it. The tuner buttons just do what they want - I push volume down and it changes the radio station I'm listening to, etcetera. The circuit boards under the plastic housing just don't function correctly. I don't know for sure if they malfunction or just don't have the right support so that when you press a button it does not function correctly.I'm always touching the cd cover somehow. It's poorly placed and is clumsy to work with. The cd cover is always popping open dumping the cd out.Sorry folks...... I just hate this thing. Real junk as far as I'm concerned."
5,CD cassette portable player,It's nice and compacted. It's just what I was looking for to play CDs. It has a great sound and fits perfectly in mybedroom. I highly recommend it.
4,It's the great speakers!,"It's no BOSE, but Sony came up with a wonderful thing when they invented these speakers! The depth and detail of the sound, at almost any volume, is pretty remarkable for a boom box at this price. This is an older model, which isn't readily available anymore. The models Sony came up with to replace this one just can't compare to the sound quality of this one.I'm a licensed massage therapist. I use one of these in my office, and one when I do outdoor chair massage. They both deliver excellent sound in both settings. And even after a few mishaps when the unit fell off a table, it still keeps going strong! Just use extra care when opening and closing the CD cover on top of the unit. The plastic hinges on that cover seem to be the weakest link of the unit."
3,Rediscovered and Re-issued!,"This CD was originally recorded in December 1980, and re-released by JSP this year. The music therefore, is 20 years old, but still sounds pretty fresh. Mars, who resides in England, certainly shows that he ranks among one of the best harp players on either side of the pond. His songs are a mixture of soulful R&B, blues and a little old time rock & roll. Standout harp tracks are ""Johnny's Groove"", ""If I had a Woman"" and ""Mighty Mars"". The cover of your ""Cash ain't nothing"" but trash and ""I'll go crazy"" are mediocre at best and may have been total losses if not for Mars harp playing. Otherwise a good disc."
3,A Little Bit Nicer This Time,"I Know I have been a extremley harsh critic of this album. It's not one of those albums you can just put in the cd player and expect anything like Sgt. Pepper. But after doing some reserch on it. I understand the difficulties from goin to The Pre Fab Four to the less then Pre Fab Three. Peter Tork had left two albums before and Michael Nesmith was becomeing a lot bossier even picking fights with Davy Jones and Mickey Dolenz sometimes. And would be the last album of the Monkees to feature Michael Nesmith. I enjoy Michael Nesmith song ""Listen To The Band"", ""Calico Girlfriend Samba"" as a Bonus track and I enjoyed his ""Never Say Yes To A Woman"". I Enjoyed the bonus track of Davy reading the poem.. I enjoy Mickey singing ""Mommy and Daddy"". The ""Ladies Aid Socitey"" reminds me of the show short, stupid,and funny. This album takes time for someone to enjoy it. Let it grow on you."
2,Not one of their better releases,"PRESENT is a very minor collection of late Monkees tunes. Only a couple of songs (""Listen To The Band"" and the uncensored version of ""Mommy and Daddy,"" included here as a bonus track) are of much interest. The material given to Davy is especially weak. Even the mix seems rough and hurried.Only hardcore fans need pay much attention."
4,Fine,"This is a good audio card if one needs to supplement the main on-board sound mechanisms in a PC. My own model has a motherboard with an AMD chipset, and my machine, which runs on Linux Mandriva, recognizes the card's presence and readily provided the necessary drivers for it.They're available from among thousands and thousands of programs, all of which come free, with the operating system.I can't agree with previous negative reviewers. There's nothing wrong with this product. It's very good, especially for the price. The big problem is that other users have relied on Windows, I imagine. For anyone operating on Linux, however, it's fine."
2,Disappointed,"I had wanted a book that was more detailed, that explained everything about the cattle dog. The book does not do that, it is a very brief summary of their habits."
1,Don't Buy - Can only read on a PC,"I've read this collection several times in my distant past, and loved the stories! I was very disappointed when I received the CD and learned that the only way I could read it was on a PC monitor. Audio or the ability to print the stories for reading is not available on the CD. It is extremely misleading on the way it's sold. Buyer Beware!"
2,Monkees go out with a whimper,"You have to feel sorry for Micky and Davy that they had nothing better to in 1970 than put out a Monkees album. Especially since the two remaining Monkees were arguably the least talented musically. The album does have it's moment's, notably ""99 Pounds"" which is a mid-tempo rocker and ""Midnight Train"" which appeared previously on the television show. There is nothing particularly bad about the rest of the songs here, but it's no ""Abbey Road"" in terms of swan songs. It surprises me that Micky or Davy didnt release a subsequent solo album billed as ""The Monkee"", but I suppose it was a contractual thing."
4,A Refresher,"This book may not necessarily tell you something that you don't know already. However, it may just jog your memory. Great for gift giving."
2,Only Two Song,"Only worth buying for two songs. The trippy ""Porpoise Song"" and ""Daddy's Song"", where Davy goes Sammy Davis Jr. on the audience."
1,A photocopied text book.,"Though I was buying a used textbook, I didn't expect the pages will be photocopied. I would have returned it if not for the price I bought it. The pictures of the UNIX dialog box in the text book are not visible because it has a black background and the writing is white and crooked. I have to stain my eyes to see the commands that was typed in. It would have been better if I even got an international edition, so I will know that I paid for what I got."
3,Decent coverage of low-level unix-like usage,"The book covers the lower-level concepts of using Linux. Not much by way of practical ""OK, I've installed Linux, what do I do now?"" advice, but a decent reference for those wishing to become more familiar with a bare-bones Unix-like system."
1,"Too many errors, who proof read it ????","I am a College Student using this book, my prof. likes it because he does not have to work at making exercise for us to do, but the whole class seems to hate the book, we only meet once a week, but during those couple hours we find about 10 mistakes. to many typo's, and the review questions at the end of the chapter don't help either, there are more than one spot where the answer could be multiple but there is only one answer ????? i would not use this book. unless you have an O'Reillys ""Unix in a nutshell"" handy."
5,A Realistic Picture of the Depression,"""In Open Spaces"" is a lovely read and reminded me somewhat of the tales my parents told me about their own trials and tribulations in the Canadian Prairies during the depression years.The story is told in the first person viewpoint of Blake Arbuckle as he lyrically explains his families' struggle to keep their Montana Ranch afloat through the difficult years of WWI and the ""dirty thirties."" The setting and the ranch are characters just as clearly defined as the members of this emotionally charged family. The story tends to be character-driven and you can't help but love some and hate others as is appropriate. At the end of the book you are ready for more about this complicated family and Blake's own tantalizing romance."
4,Well written if not a bit preachy,"I enjoyed this book and felt that it was well written. Unfortunately, as others have noted, the veracity of the book has been called into question. I also found the book a bit preachy and reptitive. Yeah, yeah, we KNOW - the president and the others in the administration are forgetting the bottom half of society. Enough already! But, a good and quick read that people looking for an inside look into DC will enjoy."
3,"I appreciate Robert Reich's pedantic, nuanced style","Reich always is the reader in his audiobooks. He's the type of author that adds much greater meaning by narrating his own works, because his use of intonation, pace and timing is superior. He's obviously not just real smart but a standout among geniuses. In this book, he improbably explains what it was like for him to serve as Secretary of Labor and somehow not lose his soul or get tainted by corruption. Even now, I wonder what he has that kept him immune from the seedy side of power. It makes me suspicious that he didn't have much power after all compared to peers.In this book, Reich makes the case for increasing minimum wage. He's always on the side of the bottom 70% of society. Irrespective of politics, I think anybody would feel stimulated to hear Reich speak. I continue to buy all his books in audio format, which is the best way to get his content."
1,Copy protection ruins this CD - Be careful!,This is an excellent learning tool.....WHEN IT DECIDES TO LOAD AND RUN!!!I don't know what kind of copy protection they are using but it prevents me from using the CD most of the time. Other CDs are recognised but not not this one. This piece of *#(* will only be recognised as a CD with data after rebooting and then only a small percentage of the time.That's a shame too. If not for that fact I would rate it highly but as it mostly useless and not heavy enough for a paper weight I give it 1 star.BTW. I contacted the tech support and they accused me of using an illegal copy. They had no answers.
1,"Heat cable, not so hot!","I am not pleased with this product. It does emit some heat from it, but nothing that I would say is useful. I would not recommend. I was really looking forward to this item. Very dissappointed. someone else may find it to be what they are looking for. I do not find it useful, not enough heat."
4,An overlooked gem,"By 1969 The Monkees seemed to be running out of steam. Peter departed, the show had been canceled, their creative 1968 theatrical movie ""Head"" and 1969 TV-Special ""331/3 Revolutions Per Monkee"" met little fanfare. Too bad this creative and energetic gem was lost in the shuffle. Mostly a collection of solo efforts and leftovers, this collection is definitely worth a listen. Micky kicks it off with the Beatlesque ""Through The Looking Glass"" and contributes the well produced ""Just A Game"" as well as an opus to his cat, ""Shorty Blackwell"". Davy sings the mauldlin ""The Girl I Left Behind Me"" as well as the hard hitting ""You and I"". Mike stands out with my personal favorite, ""While I Cry"". ""Tear Drop City"" is a pale ""Last Train To Clarksville"" remake. Worthy bonus tracks include ""Someday Man"" and ""Smile""."
5,A great rare Manhattan Transfer album!,"Recorded in the late 70s at the peak of their performance cycle. Great songs, an excellent audio recording for its time. A great price too!"
1,Sadly disappointed,This text is a pathetic excuse for educational material. It gives meager examples and many are not even applicable to the chapter exercises. By far this is the poorest written text I have encountered in three years of college.
4,interesting book,"I bought this because I like the d'Aulaires' book - specifically the ""Book of Greek Myths,"" ""Leif the Lucky,"" ""Wings for Per"" and ""Don't Count Your Chicks."" I wasn't familiar with this title before purchasing it. This was an interesting choice for a reprint. The little dog starts off getting lost because he's scrawny & hungry and his owner is teasing him with a bone. When my son's old enough to understand the book, I'm curious to see if he'll want to know why the dog didn't just get enough food in the first place."
4,An encounter with love,"This is a fairly short, but intense book that examines the problem of suffering in God's salvation of men. Overberg takes the reader through many of the classical arguments about suffering before he gets to the point of his book, the Incarnation as God's central act of salvation. It is a powerful point, well worth buying the book for. Yet, in the end, the goal of explaining suffering remains elusive. I think we need to live with the the centrality of Incarnation for a long time before we will be in a position to understand how it relates to suffering."
1,Pretty bad for BSC,"Kristy in Charge was maybe the stupidest BSC book I ever read. I like BSC a lot but this one really disappointed me. A short story was made long and it was kind of boring. It was a little interesting, but not really. And Ann M. Martin favors Kristy too much---shouldn't the other BSC members have Great Ideas more often? Do not read this book if you are looking for excitement because you won't find it here."
5,The Best Book,"In One crazy week, The kids at SMS have become teachers. Mallory faces an out of control English class. Mary Anne did the same too. And this is Kristy's first assignement. She will be teaching gym class with Cary Retlin instead they make a teacher feud! Kristy has to win. She only wants the person to teach gym class to kids."
5,A Fun Read!,The author enjoys what he writes and the reader enjoys what he writes. If you like goblins and fantasy you'll love this read.
4,how many sword and sorcery books have any humor at all ?,"and aren't written by Terry Pratchett. All the major characters have back stories, and some depth. And the author succeeds in making the main character a goblin of few redeeming virtues and yet someone you root for.Good plot, characters, humor even if there's very little that's new here."
2,On and on and on and on,"I should not have bought this series. Let's put it this way, I couldn't wait until it was over! I will donate it to our public library, so I have something to feel good about.And then the ending. They dragged Nina all over occupied France, so they could get her to England with all the info she had in her head about the French underground..only to find out at the end that her info was obsolete. The writers didn't even make us feel good that something was accomplished!In the opening scene, one French resistance leader wanted to shoot her so the Germans would not capture her with all this ""vital"" personnel info. They should have shot her and ended the series there.Don't waste your money."
3,Manhunt,"Started out slow and continued slow until the last few discs. Cyd Heyman cried and stumble and fell far too much. Alfred Lynch was obnixious, and for a trained military combat pilot appeared undisciplined, obnoxious and downright stupid at times."
5,"very nice, and durable","my grandson loves his toy, and nothing has happened with it yes, and he uses it more than other toys he has, so I recommend this product highly"
