4,We cruised right thru..,We bought these and had no problem getting two thru in each bag on Carnival Cruise Glory. We each took a 32 and an 8 oz. We saved a lot on drinks and then won $500 at poolside bingo which wiped out our tab except for $44. :) Great purchase.
5,A great idea!,"Took rum on our recent cruise, and passed through a rigorous screening process undetected. Excellent, prompt service and a good product. If you cruise, you need this kit!"
5,Great Resource,"I wish I had a book like this when I was trying to select a college 20 years ago. Kaplan also has a college guide for African American students that is also a great resource. It is called ""The DayStar Guide to Colleges for African American Students"". I highly recommend both books!"
2,Only if you have alot of patience,"This game has the severe potential to be alot of fun but if you don't have a tremendous amount of patience, forget it! It's almost as if the game sets you up for failure. Each time you corral a sheep, a few get loose...when you get all the sheep but one, a barricade pops up making it impossible to get the last sheep. Maybe if you are hospitalized and don't have anything else to do, this game might work out for you."
2,Annoying to watch,"I am sure the military strategies depicted are accurate and quite interesting for military history buffs, but I could barely stand to watch this and only did so because I had paid for it.Little trumpeting music played in the background the whole time, and made it hard to focus on what was being said. It was completely unnecessary.This documentary focuses almost entirely on a few battles in Cuba, giving the Phillipines and Puerto Rico only a brief mention. Also fails to discuss the social-political climate of Cuban citizens (didn't even mention the Phillipines or Puerto Rico in this context) and only gave a short mention on the role the media magnates Hearst and Pulitzer played in trumpeting the nation to war.Take away the goofy music, the reenactments would be fine if they had a lesser role, and show a broader more in-depth overview of the war and this would make a fine documentary."
3,"Honey, I Shrunk the Politics","The video ""The Spanish-American War: Birth of a Superpower"" does a good job on using photographic evidence and reinacting to portray the war in Cuba and in the Philippines. Its analysis of military events is good but not historically insightful. It is, for the most part, devoid of any useful discussion of the international politics of the day, and does only a cursory job of covering American domestic politics.If you like shoot-'em-up-history, this video is for you.Rick Whaley"
1,horrible,"This is definetely one of the worst physics books I have seen. They neither really incorporate the math as if they are afraid people will be frightened and then when they do, it is REALLY hard to follow. Explanations are really, really bad, each topic is about 30 pages long, but the essence of a concept is never elucidated. You learn how to solve THEIR problems, but you never quite understand what is really going on. Unfortunately, I HAD to buy this book for a class."
2,These run SMALL!,Right this minute I am comfortably wearing a pair of size 6 Lee boot cut jeans.I ordered these in a 9 (because I am aware jrs sizes run smaller).They are so small I can't even get them on!Not even close!Just be aware of this if you decide to order these.Otherwise they are really cute.
4,great look fit could be better,Awesome! not the BEST fit on my Jetta(I guess thats the trade off for being universal) but it really looks great!
5,In a fair and just world...,"everyone would be talking about Aunt Bettys and Michael Knott would be hailed as one of the more gifted songwriters of his generation. As it is, we live in a cruel and spiteful world and the Aunt Bettys have disbanded and Michael Knott continues to toil in obscurity. The band plays unabashed power chord rock star rock while Knott's lyrics gleefully skewer life as we know it. I looked the band up on AMG and was surprised that they labeled Knott as a Christian songwriter. Any religious connotations here must be hidden very deep beneath lyrics dealing with various addictions, particularly the hilarious Addict and the mournful Jane (the 3rd song I know about a drug addict named Jane-hmmmm). Other standouts include Suicide Sex Doll, Little Fighter, Star Baby, & Lush. Double is so sad it makes my stomach hurt. If somehow you've happened across this page, heed this & other reviews and give this CD a try before it disappears."
4,Heartwarming,"Shows the triumph of the human spirit and the power of music, and how it can change lives. Good family movie with messages."
3,VHS Broke in the mail,"VHS tape mailed in bubble wrap-lined envelope. Door to tape cassette was broken on one end, so could not go into VHS player. Tape also was not rewound."
5,One of the best movies I've seen.,"I've watched this movie three times in as many days. It's a little slow paced and took me about a half hour to get into it, but then I was hooked, and couldn't get enough. Richard Dreyfuss plays a man, attempting to persue his dream, but gets bogged down with family and financial responsibilities, and the pressures and demands of his job. Have some tissues handy, you'll need them, but it's not all tears, There are some laughs along the way. It contains some profanity, which I don't care for, but very little, and would be a shame to miss so great a movie because of it."
1,something fishy,"The dvd came in what seemed to be original shrink wrap. When I popped it into my computer, I was concerned at first because my Media Player noted that the dvd was titled ""Dead Poet's Society."" A good movie, but not the one I'd ordered. The picture was not clear, and was no more clear when played on my DVD player. A few scenes I recall were deleted. Overall, I was rather disappointed."
5,Great! I love this!,I love this movie! Everyone should have a chance to watch this wonderful movie! I feel bad for the people who don't get to watch this movie.
5,One of the best movies dealing with the state of education and the arts,"This movie is a very heart-warming story about a frustrated composer who has to become a music teacher to make a living. While the storyline of his development as a teacher and the growth of his music program is a touching story in itself, it also touches on several issues outside of the narrative that are still present in education today; namely, the cutting of arts programs in schools in favor of math and science. This movie demonstrates how important music is in the lives of students and how important it is in creating well-rounded young minds."
2,"SCHMALTZY AND CLICHED, SAVED ONLY BY DREYFUSS","Most of the reviewers on Amazon seemed to have loved this movie. They've said it made them cry, and think. This movie didn't provoke a tear from me.I am not sure I'd attend classes that begin with rhetoric like 'What is music?' but Dreyfuss does a decent job of a quasi-inspiring teacher. Although this band master could be a little less mean when returning assignments.The acting overall in the film is pretty plain though, and the somewhat interesting premise gets old real quick.Some scenes are even borderline idiotic. First, our supposedly great teacher expects kids who don't know how to play their instruments to be playing Mozart after one day.Then, there is a scene where he is teaching a girl how to play her clarinet. She has been playing the thing for 3 years but still can't get out a note. He tells her to think of the sunset, and suddenly she can play perfectly.Corny. Very corny. Dreyfuss is pretty much the only thing going for this one-time rental."
2,New but not well made,"This re-issue of the Brodsky/Weiss memos looks like a print-on-demand book. When laid down it never lays flat, as though the binding were too small for all the pages crammed inside. I'm glad to be able to read the memos but quality still matters,"
2,Not Very Self Sufficient,"I bought this book thinking that the author was going to describe his activities while living on an island in Nova Scotia in a self sustaining manner. He doesn't. He purchases an island, moves there with his wife and step son, and then publishes his daily notes concerning his moods, relationships (which are not always pleasant), and how he passes the time. He regularly motors to the mainland to buy food and do laundry. They grow nothing, except a failed attempt at sod (SOD?). He fires off a hundred or so shotgun shells, and kills two ducks. Most of the local food is provided by his mainland neighbors. I would have much rather read about their lives than his. At times he waxes philosophical about the evils and pitfalls of our society, especially television. Then he states he has a heavy chemical dependency. This is not one of the better ""how I did it on my own"" books that I've read."
5,"Powerful, Unusual Deck","I purchased this deck a few months ago during a troubling point in my life and upon opening the deck, I could tell this was THE deck for me. The images themselves are just breathtaking! I have used this deck often and now it is the one I go to first. It's a bit different than a traditional Tarot as the images are all female and most of the major arcana are given different names. The readings I have gotten from the cards have been extremely accurate and I love the chakra cards which can be used alone or with the other (alchemy) cards. The book which comes with it is lovely, although the writing style is a bit ""flowery"". However it is very sincere and you can feel the wisdom of this deck and ""understand"" it even without the book. There is a section on each card where it will recomend a food, herb or flower to help balance you. Beautiful deck for women!"
5,"Girl, you have got to get this book",I loved this book. I am civil servant working with a low income and reading this book is getting me together. I recommend this book to any sister or anyone that needs to get there finances together. This book couple with prayer will get you there.
5,Seems Like It's Working,"I bought this carafe because I accidently broke the other one when I was rinsing it out in the community sink. The coffee maker isn't mine. It belongs to another guy in the office, so I thought it was the only right thing to do because a lot of other people in the office actually rely on this coffee maker too. I'm just glad I found a carafe that was just like the one I broke, and it seems like it's working as advertised."
1,"Great coffemaker, crappy carafe!","This is the second replacement carafe that i have bought in a year. I LOVE the coffemaker, but the R&D team at Cuisinart must be taking alot of coffee and donut breaks. This carafe lasts about 3 or 4 months before it starts to leak where the plastic meets the glass at the top. It only takes a few times for the water to leak all over the counter when you try to fill the coffeemaker, or to pour hot coffee all over yourself, to make you want to throw out the whole thing. I wish they would make a better carafe. This one stinks."
4,Freshest Tasting Coffee Ever!,"I was given this coffee pot for a gift and thought why grind coffee when you can buy it already ground....coffee is freshest tasting ever and no bitter after taste. Unfortunately I dropped the glass pot on the counter and it shattered. I had difficulty finding a replacement pot, but, WAHLA, Shop AOL had the pot and the option of black or white."
5,Love it,I have a problem with breaking these poor pitchers. Thanks for the replacements...I'd hate to have to purchase a hole new coffee machine every time I broke the pitcher.
2,Problem Carafe,The handle is not sturdy and has broken twice. Replacement carafe is $18 with shipping charges of $7.50. Seems excessive for a $69 coffee maker.
2,Was Ok,"Jeff has a great voice; and after hearing him tell his testimony and sing at a church in Brownsville Florida, I really wanted some of his music. This CD just didn't fit my personal taste very well, maybe it wasn't modern or live sounding enough."
1,Cheap Poor Quality,Daisy P51Got 30 shots off and leather sling broke. Hardly worth the trouble to get another cheap China crap. I'll make my own and hope the rubber doesn't snap me in the face next time.
3,great price for a nice watch,"This is a nice watch for the price. The face is colorful, the date is really helpful and the overall look is genuine. I would recommend this seller too!"
5,"Classic, elegant, versatile.","Actually bought these to go with the single strand Onyx Bead necklace. But I ended up liking the earrings to wear alone. Very simple but elegant. Silver and Black always looks elegant, can be dressed down or up. Great for work, with or without the matching necklace. A great deal."
1,gigabyte does not back their warranty,"I bought this card and it immediately started having problems. I contacted the manufacturer because it had been passed the specified sellers date to return. Gigabyte had me ship it 2 times to them and sent back same card without repair. The card will not run on any of my 3 pcs at home. They will not replace their products and this card is only 7 months old, still under the 3 year manufacture warranty. I will never buy another product from gigabyte again and I advise anyone else to do the same. check this companys ratings on the better business bureau they have a rating of F! Terrible product, rip off for a company."
1,They Could've Tested It Before Releasing It,"I purchased this game for my Dad (who's a pretty savvy computer user in his own right), based upon our mutual enjoyment of Rowan's ""Mig Alley"". This game WON'T install, we can't uninstall it, and to add insult to injury, Mig Alley now crashes when we try to run it (so there's obviously some kind of heinous conflict going here).Just another case of a game, delayed ad infinitum, and finally foisted on the public so that we, having paid full retail, can debug it for the developer."
1,If you don't store enough food? It falls down!,"I liked the idea of be able to store food and keep the bowls in the same place. But found out very shortly that if you don't store enough food, to support the upper level, it falls down....and when the water bowl is full... NOT such a good idea.Also...keep in mind that if any drop of water penetrates between the metal bowl and the plastic, you will have smelly mold...I just can't stand this thing anymore!!!"
3,I guess its ok,I like the store in feed but when you take the top off make sure you have some patience to put it back on if you need it to go to one of the lower levels... In the instructions it tells you all what you have to do is turn it when going down but it is more then that... But over all its an ok product...
4,Worthy contribution from this NJ guy,"I got a copy of this book after watching Bruder's very funny web series ""Who the Hell is Dan Bruder"" and was expecting more intelligent, pie-in-the-face comedy. I was surprised and caught off guard when there were many poignant, even quite emotional stories he shares with everyday things like his dog's cute habits to the horrors of dealing with his spouse's cancer. He doesn't BS the reader, or try to be something he is not, just a regular guy who happens to have a bunch of interesting experiences living in the Garden State and a fairly eloquent way of writing. This book is almost a decade old, but well worth the read. The issues are timeless and I related to it."
2,Not necessary,The lense protector is useless but the body will come in handy when the camera is swinging around your neck out in the elements to keep it pretty for when you use it indoors. A little excessive though but won't do any harm.
3,"LESS THAN WHAT I EXPECTED, BUT DOES WHAT IT SAYS","Although it looks like it would fit within the soft case, it does NOT. Since the wrap around soft case is so easily removed and not actually attached to the camera like the quality leather cover of an old 35mm reflex camera of days gone by, I wanted two layers of protection. You just can't fit one within the other. Why would the two products not be made to work together? Bad design, I guess."
4,Camera Armor,Absolutely wonderful product. Fits snug on the camera without impeding access to the controls. Highly recommended for anyone who wants to protect a hard earned investment.
4,A Real Eye Opener,"As a first year culinary student I have found a lot of the information that I have been given is very overwhelming and makes you think twice about wanting to become a chef. And although this book does show the exhaustive traning and life of a chef, it was very interesting and also challenging. It makes you realize all of the things that you have to go through in order to become a chef. Becoming a chef is not for weaklings or lazy people! This book is a real eye-opener and I think that anyone who is interested in becoming a chef should read it. I also like the way it is written; almost like a mystery novel-you keep reading so that you can find out what happens!"
1,And he calls himself a writer?,"How good can a ""foodie"" book be written by a wanna-be foodie who misspells MFK Fisher's name and mascarpone?"
4,"Balanced, colourful.",I've really enjoyed this colourful book. I have brought it to meetings to show clients different 'styles' before producing the graphics of a home page. So I particular liked the 100 page 'show case' showing many good examples of well-balanced home page layouts. The 'sites best unseen' could have been left out.
1,Embarrassing,The only reason I give this book 1 star is because zero was not an option in the popdown menu.
2,underwhelming,This dvd is less than an elevator version of an epic. It provides only general information and offers little insight into the life of Carnegie. Save your money.
5,Only One,"If I could recommend only one book for parents who want to start their children on a life path of success and happiness, MasterMind DreamMakers is it.This book has given our family a shorthand language to remind ourselves of, and reinforce, values that lead to strong self-esteem, respect for all people and creation, self-fulfillment, peace and joy."
5,Awesome oh wow !,"I think this book is a book that inspires young children to get along and to attract good thoughts and good people.The book has fun activities and stories that make the book more interesting for those who read the book.I think this book will inspire kids who read it.It is a fun book that shows kids what is right and what is wrong.It has fun characters like Cuddles,Watts,Lani,Patches.It gives kids right ideas for a better life.It also teaches about being a Mastermind rather than being a Monstermind.Suggested age: 12 and under"
5,What a fun book!,This book is so much more than it appears. It promotes sharing feelings and discussing heart's desires. My son wanted to keep reading and playing all night. He said the DreamMaker Game was the best game he ever played. This could be for adults too!
5,"Fits perfect, almost.","I have ordered bushings from Energy before for the lower control arms on my 2001 Honda civic and they were perfect. These however need a little more input from you the installer that I expected. It was not a large issue, but there was a bit of ""trimming"" required to get the rear inserts to go in correctly. I trimmed some off of the insert and the original rubber mount as well. The front one went in with out a hitch though.Just a quick note for those that weren't sure, these fit into the original mount, around the oem rubber mount. I thought when I bought these that you had to remove the oem rubber, but that's not the case. There is quite a bit of vibration at idle after you install these. This is due to the added rigidity of these inserts, once you get rolling though it is almost un-noticable.I'm giving the five stars because as a product they do what they say they do. Can't beat that."
1,"That's right, 1 star.","I, like many others here it seems, am a fan of Phish and have a pretty open mind when it comes to music. Still, this will never be listened to again by me. Is it jazz? Is it a jam? I'd say it's the sound of a bunch of great musicians all playing a different song at the same time. Honestly. Some parts are dead quite, others are obnoxiously loud, but all are just annoying. Listen before you buy, and if you're looking for something non-Phish with Trey in it, just get his ""Shine"" album, or even Oysterhead."
5,An insight,"Very well done video giving the history, both ancient and modern , of the Great Wall and it's place in Chinese and world history. Not only does it show you how and why the wall was buily, but you have a chance to examine the actual architectural methods used. I used this with my hisotry class since we are studying China and they were attentive and curious about the video and its information. Nicely done"
2,just so so...,"I normally adore anything written by Tami Hoag - I even loved Dark Horse, but this....I found I really didn't like her lead Elena very much at all...do I understand why she might be the way she is...absolutely...but all I could think about was what an absolute B*tch she was....after every scene with every person I kept coming away with the same thing....she is incredibly unlikeable....The story itself is not really what I've come to expect from Hoag...it was very slow. That coupled with the unlikeable heroine left me cold..."
3,Garlic Peeler,"The peeler works just fine, but I am not surewhy I bought . I really do not use it much."
1,Don't buy if you want to watch dvd movies on win xp,"This DVD player works fine with windows 98, but if you're ever thinking about using windows XP, don't buy this one, unless you feel that it's okay never to be able to watch dvd movies on it.So basicly any other dvd player works better than this one."
5,Awesome!,"Another excellent book by Elizabeth Fulton,and fellow emapth! She is very knowledge and full of wisdom as a psychic healer for the animals. This is my second book of her's,and most easy to fellow and understand. I talked with her few times,and felt her loving energy,pure in heart. She is Always in my heart the BEST!"
1,Disappointed; book lacks instruction in procedure,"Animal Reiki is well-written and it is obvious that the author has had a lot of hands on (pardon the pun) experience. There are many case histories and the book reads well. I am disappointed however as there are no instructions as to the practice of Reiki in the book; the reader is told to find a Reiki instructor and take classes. This book reads like a diary not an instruction manual - which I thought it would be. I have purchased Four Paws - Five Directions through Amazon and this book give clear instructions on Reiki, acupressure and other holistic animal healing. I highly recommend FOUR PAWS - FIVE DIRECTIONS to anyone interested in the holistic approach to healing family pet animals. But this book, Animnal Reiki? Naw - don't waste your money."
2,Animal Reiki,Many thanks to N. Trant Topaz in Florida who stated that the Animal Reiki was of no help. I purchased Four Paws Five Directions and Ms. Topaz is correct in stating that Four Paws helps teach and show you what to do for your pet for any illness. I use this book every day on Chauncy and it helps. A must have for anyone who has a pet with problems. My guy had liver problems with a mass. With this book and holistic remedies this mass it gone with the latest ultra-sound results. Another excellent book that Amazon's sells is Whole Health for Happy Dogs by Jill Elliot DVM & Kim Bloomer which did get a bad review which it didn't deserve. Lots of good information and well worth it in both books.
2,dead battery,"I purchased this watch several months ago and received it with a dead battery which I replaced. I recently broke the watch by accident, (my fault) and ordered a new one to replace it and it also had a dead battery. I like the watch but I have spent as much on new batterys for the new watches as I have to buy the watches. They should figure out a way to send out a watch that runs when you receive it!"
5,trip hop,"purchased for my mother for the holidays, extremely relaxing and thought provoking beats/trip hop with some vocals. very happy with product, great for relaxing. purchased because of the ""Waterfalls (one love mix)"""
1,Don't do it.,"I dont' know if EPSON still sells this model....but if so, it's without conscience. I've been through 3 in 3 years...don't do it."
1,waste,"Not only do the cartridges last all of about five days, but I just put in a new high capacity black ink cartridge, but it won't let me print plain text because it's low on yellow ink. I set the thing on ""black and white only"" and still need to have color cartridges. Rip-off."
3,Nominate for 'Bad Sex in Fiction' Award!,"A rip-roaring yarn, real page-turner but Mr Moore really needs to remember that when writing about sex less is definitely more. I was in tears (of laughter) at his crass attempt to describe the heroine's 'awakening.'"
2,....Ummmm wat can I say,I was not happy with this book in it's entirely. Even though in the end it said everyone got their just deserve I felt that things were so rushed at the end not everyone did and it left me kind of puzzled as to what happened. I'm hoping to read the second part to this novel and maybe that will help me out. But I would not recommend this book to my friends to buy maybe something to read when there is nothing else to do.
4,"Really good, really sad & tragic","The book in my opinion was a page-turner. The grammar and usage was poor but for the most part, the author got the story and point across. Sometimes it read like a book and other times like a movie or something. A gruesome tale of real life. Will read the next book."
2,Hmmm... could use some work,"Granted, the story itself was good... it definitely had its' strong points, but as an avid reader of books (avg. 2-3 books a week) I was tempted to put it down just because the editing was so bad. The only thing that kept me reading was the fact that I wanted to see how it would end. I wouldn't say this is the worst book I've read in terms of storylines (although the character storyline was a little predictable), but the editing was TERRIBLE. I would highly recommend Crown Publishing Company to hire some better editors before final release to the public. Good first effort for K'wan though!"
5,I luv this book,I was really surprised by this book. I was expecting the usually and I was mistaken. I luv how he showed the good and bad side of gangs. You will have so many emotions while reading this book. If you luv urban fiction this is a must have book. I will 4ever be a fan of K'Wan now. Get the sequel too.
3,My birds don't care for this product,"I am sure the product is great, I just don't have the right birds around my house. Maybe this summer more birds will come and like it."
3,Heartbreaker review,"The only problem I had with this book was actually believeing some of the stories that this author shares about his experience with Judy Garland, some of it comes off as Tabloid in nature while at other moments it is very heartfelt and affectionate."
2,Causes Terrible Gas Mileage,K&N77-3062KP; Polished Performance Intake KitThis installed easily and does give more power but it lowered my mileage from 13 to 10mpg and this is after the first tank when I touch the pedal lightly. So don't install it thinking you will improve your mileage !
5,No Problems,"There's not a lot to say about these replacement slings. I had no problems with them. All I can say is that when you put them on, just add a little water to the inside edge and they go on like butter."
2,Non-authorized video?,"I have used the Precision Toning VHS in the past. I feel that this ""NEW Method"" release is basically an attempt to transfer the original VHS footage into a DVD format (the new consumer media). This would explain the poor video clarity and the recycling of footage. For those looking for a better quality DVD, I would suggest a newer release."
4,"nice photographs, but focuses upon more rare glass","This book has great photography, all in color. It's just disappointing, given the title, that it does not include the kinds of pieces new collectors find and want to be able to look up. Instead, the authors are trying not to include glass which has already been documented in the out-of-print books from the 1950s-1980s.However, the authors are highly respected members of the National Milk Glass Collectors society and this book is a great contribution they can be proud of.(One more comment-- be aware that the Atterbury rabbit dish on the cover of this book is not included or discussed in any way in the book.)"
4,Very good reference,I liked the fact that it covers a wide range of styles and manufacturers. Not crazy having to refer to the back of the book for pricing. Too much work. Easy/cheap for the editor to update pricing but makes for disruptive reading.
1,I have been cheated!,I'am truly disappointed with this book. How can Karen Leewrite such an unrealistic book? I felt very cheated. The onlycharacter I truly liked was Travis. I thought Eve was too shelfish and dellusional. And DJ seems to be to overdrawnand boring. I was rooting for Travis until the author paintedhim as a green monster. I thought the author should havedevelop Travis and Eve's relationship. Instead of having Everun after DJ. The author really was really rushing through thisbook.This book is not worth the $11.00. If you consider purchasingthis book. Please read the reviews and come up with your owndecision. Karen Lee will not get another dime from me! Karen pleasetake your time with your next book. Make your characters morerealistic and belivable
4,Good basic printer,The reason I selected this printer is for the fact that the paper is enclosed in a covered area rather than just being left out open on a paper-feed tray. This helps keep the paper from becoming damaged by having the edges bent which would cause paper jams or the paper becoming dirty. (you'd be amazed at how many people eat stuff while hanging around the office printer while waiting for their documents to print.)
5,So Far.......So Good,So far......does what it is supposed to do. Prints. Color is what you expect from an InkJet. No problems. Just click and go.
4,Looking for a good book on Paul,If you are looking for a good book on Paul this is one that should consider. I enjoyed what Stendahl had to say about Paul. Take a look at this good book.
5,Part of my continual study!!!,An amazing study book. Encourages me to continue in my Native American roots search. Thank you. I have all of Garretts books.
3,Hollywood Whitewash,"""Pal Joey"" (1957) makes a sanitized translation to the big screen, with a trio of classic stars - Rita Hayworth, Frank Sinatra and Kim Novak - elevating an uneven, overlong musical. The film is worth seeing for Sinatra's signature tune ""The Lady Is a Tramp"" and director George Sidney's visual stylishness, yet lacks the hard-edged quality of the stage version. Thanks to the prudish Hays Office, ""Pal Joey"" emerges as another casualty of Hollywood censorship."
2,"Dated, but not because it's old","This movie expects the audience to believe that a really unappealing character like Sinatra's Joey would attract two very reasonable women. It's an old idea that has run its course.The movie gets 2 stars for good music. Nice clothes, too."
3,"Good Music, great stars!!!","But I wonder how it would have been if Gene Kelly reprised his roll as Pal Joey. Kim Novak and Rita Hayworth are always lovely to look at, and Sinatra is of course, Sinatra! Nobody can sing ""That's Why the Lady is a Tramp"" like he can. Not one of the greatest movie musicals, but certainly very good. Classic songs from the American songbook."
1,Lemon,"We bought a Panasonic PV-DM2791, and we finally arranged to exchange for a different model. The worst thing about the TV is the VCR. From the very beginning, it didn't want to accept videotapes. At least 70% of the time, the tapes would ""catch,"" and the VCR would spit them back out. When we finally got the tape into the VCR, it occasionally didn't record properly. It was very loud rewinding and fast-forwarding. Then there was the DVD player, which didn't seem to handle the sound on the DVDs very well. Half the time, we'd have to turn the volume all the way up to the max in order to hear the dialogue. We tried adjusting all the audio settings, but nothing helped.In short, steer clear of this one... The model we exchanged it for is a Panasonic PV-DM2792, and so far, it's 100% better (not to mention less expensive!)."
4,Cute and Durable,Bought this for my rough & tough preschool boy. He used it for 2 years before he finally wore out the straps. Still uses it for an occasional overnight bag without the straps. Just adorable.
4,violence but not as much bonds,just buy it no dorky review just buy it man i told you to buy it beeeep beeeeep i told you to buy it .
2,C-grade western,"Its probably the worst FPS i ever played... dull, schematic, boring... As a c-grade western film... If u like FPS games u can play it, but you will not find any real thrill in it."
3,Join the revolution get red faction!,Red faction is probaly the best first person shooter ive played since 007 for N64. I was pleasantly surprised w/ the game play and the weaponry the game provided. I definite purchase-p.s.- i cant wait for the 007 shooter to come out for the ps2-
3,Mediocre but occasionally entertaining,"This is your run of the mill half-life wannabe. I think people latched on to it because it was early in the PS2 lifecycle. There are moments when you are really drawn in, but most of the time it's lacking all the little touches and creativity that made half-life great. The multiplayer is really nothing more than a glorified goldeneye, which may be some people's bag (definitely not mine)."
1,This is NOT leather!,"This camcorder bag is NOT leather. Contrary to the description provided by Amazon, there is no leather used in the contsruction of this bag; it is instead a ""pleather"" type material that dosen't seem like the strongest stuff to be used for the bottom of a bag holding a $600+ camcorder!I wanted to use this for my new Canon HF100 camcorder, but there isn't enough room for the camera, adaptor/charging cord, wide angle lens and extra battery. The bag bulges at the seams with all contents crammed in, so not sure of its durability. I'm taking a trip to Ireland for 8 days, and don't want the bag to be more of a burden than it should be."
2,"NARS' ""Orgasm"" is a horrendous color","This review is for NARS' Orgasm color, which I bought on Amazon. Although the quality of the NARS product line seems to be fine (it uses safer ingredients than your average nail polish, some colors appear to be nice), I didn't not have such luck with Orgasm. When I reviewed the color sample online I had expected it to be a slightly pinker version of normal fingernail colors. However, when I received it, it was sparklier than it appeared to be in the picture, and there was also an ugly sheen to it, which only reminded me of bacteria and mold.I don't know about you, but I don't want unexpected yellow coloring on my nails, much less have it coming from something called Orgasm. Unfortunately I cannot return it on Amazon, so this nail polish will gather dust in the back of my medicine cabinet."
2,Color off,I had seen this color mentioned in several magazines so I ordered it. But in the pictures it seemed more pink but the actual color is more orangy which I didn't like as well.
2,Unusual Disallusion,"This book is a summary of work taken from books that Tor has read. The constant reference to other works is irritating. Having read them he then gives us his theory of conciousness which is not really supported by any tangible evidence (other than others have already thought of this idea - as well as the idea being the basis of many other religions).Its a well researched 'one idea' book, an idea that we all had at the beginning of the nineties when GUIs were appearing on computers.I bought the book because I thought it was a genuine scientific text. Alas, this was an illusion. I was just being used. Just another example of Bad Science."
1,use your illusion?,"Is this where Axel Rose came up with the title, 'Use Your Illusion' for one of Guns & Roses' albums? Hmmmmm........."
4,interesting,"This book starts out with eye-opening facts about the history of information theory and its relation to consciousness. This first section takes some concentration to get through, but it's necessary for the next section that explains the nature of consciousness itself. This part of the book is utterly fascinating and often mind-blowing. You'll be shocked to find out how your mind works, and how you previously and certainly weren't aware that it worked like THAT! The last section is disappointing, though, in that the author makes conclusions based on the flimsiest of evidence regarding the evolutionary history of human consciousness. It gets almost gobbledygooky new-agey. But the first parts of the book are founded on hard-won research, and those parts alone (if you haven't read about the original research elsewhere) are worth the price of the book many times over."
1,"Boring,Boring,Boring.........Worst book I've ever read .",This is my first book from Kellerman and my last. It started out slow and I hoped it would pick up. Well that never happened through out the whole book. I was so mad at the end of every chapter because I could not believe it was sooo dull. I would have more fun getting root canal. The ending was the worst let down. After putting up with the torture of reading the entire book it ended with as much excitement as watching your nails grow. Don't waste your money like I did.
1,Pointless,"This was a total bore. The plot (?) was contrived; there were waaay too many characters who added nothing. The original premise evoked a ""so what"" in me. The only interesting passages involved Blanche."
3,Routine,"I have to echo most of the reviewers. Although this book was not horrible, it was incredibly routine.I think this series has run its course - unfortunately."
4,A good listen,"Once again J. Kellerman has constructed an interesting story with an array of convoluted characters. As a retired law enforcement investigator, I am always most critical of the details of the fictional investigation. Kellerman stretches them but never breaks them and I appreciate that. The plot lines are, at times, a challenge to follow while listening going to and from work, but it was worth the effort."
1,Rather boring,"I am a big Kellerman fan. Actually, the only reason I didn't give up on this book sooner is because he wrote it. What a letdown. The premise to the story was very dumb. A woman on her death bed makes some goofy remark and it sends all these people and all this time on an investigation. Even though nobody really knows what the crime supposedly was. Bad story."
2,Too Unbelievable,"This book was not up to the usual Kellerman/Alex Delaware standards. I think maybe JK has run out of ideas and is stretching a bit too much. There were way too many characters who were not well developed confusing the reader. And what PD has the time to spend on a crime which never was reported? I know we have to suspend belief when reading fiction, but, come on, Milo and Alex solved a series of murders from nothing more than a few words from a dying woman???I only kept reading to see if anything interesting was happening in the private lives of Alex & Robin and Milo & Rick!JK, please don't just keep churning out books."
5,Enormous depth of on site research = top quality guide book,Tom Miller brings the quality writing & accurate detail shown in his earlier baja guide books to the west coast of mainland Mexico. We used it to find new surf spots not listed in the Surfer Guide.
4,This is the original uncut film with PG-13 rating. Should be R-rated.,"This original film depicts children being drugged and hanged. It is extremely brutal and realistic. I can't imagine it carries a PG-13 rating.The film is rather long and might not hold the attention of those who aren't truly dedicated to learning about The Holocaust, however, for those who are interested, The Rose Garden is an essential."
5,One of the best books I have ever read.,"When I finish reading a book, I give it a rating from 1-10. The Seventh Scroll received a 10+..... I just could not put it down! It was as though I was watching a fast action thriller on the big screen. The only fault I found was the sexual perversion of one of the characters. If you can overlook this flaw, it is a must read for anyone with an interest in Egyptian history. Unknowingly, I read The Seventh Scroll BEFORE I read The River God. As it turned out, I was glad I'd done it that way, and I would recommend to anyone who has not read these two books to read them in reverse order."
3,Abridged version,Description does not state Abridged or Unabridged. Be warned this is the Abridged version.
4,Archeology & Egyptology Buffs Take Note!,"I get into archeology, especially in Egypt, so I enjoyed this book and ""River God"" immensely. Wilbur Smith is an excellent writer who makes you believe the characters really lived at one point in history."
2,"Not bad, but a let down after River God","A unique way of linking two books together! I saw one of the reviews of this book stating that the books are approximately four thousand years apart in setting and that got my attention even more -- I had to see how this link could be ... the concept was wonderful. Now, on the other side of the coin, I found the characters and plot line development to be rather cookie-cutter. After being thrilled with River God, perhaps my expectations were simply too high for The Seventh Scroll. If you like an old fashioned treasure hunt, then The Seventh Scroll is for you. If like me you want to recapture the joy of reading about Taita, you'll surely be dissapointed."
1,The Seventh Scroll by Wilbur Smith,This book arrived in good condition but smelled so badly of cigarette smoke that Icouldn't give it as a gift. (My intention.) I have tried to let it air out in the Sun but it is saturated with the smell of stale cigtarette smoke. One should think twice before buying from this seller.
3,A bit dissapointing,"Having read River God and Warlock, I was anxious to start with this read. The book starts out with a bang and moves at a good pace. Unfortunately compared to the other two, this one misses the mark. Almost like the story was written in haste.I do like the way Wilbur Smith ties himself into the story. Very nice touch.I found generally the story was slow and never really reaches a peek. Some nice touches at the end to throw you off track, but not a great read.There are 3 books in the series, with this one supposedly being the second, but I found it better to read after the other two.Pity, but hey two out of three ain't bad."
3,OK for some light entertainment but don't expect to think,"Wilbur Smith does it again with fast and furious, hero and heroine, good guy bad guy, soap.I always enjoy reading Smith's novels because I know what to expect and I always get it. Dynamic, roller coaster stories in which you can sit back, be entertained and have it all explained to you (as if you couldn't work it out) in the end.A few holes in the plot, a willing suspension of disbelief as a ""smart and cunning"" hero fails to question the obvious, notoriously linear plots, and the predictable betrayal by the (Gasp) smart AND beautiful heroine (Sob), all can be happily glazed over in true Indiana Jones style.I do like the way Smith builds his historical frameworks in his novels; not quite Colleen McCulloch but sufficient to lend credibility to the central concepts.These novels are great intermission pieces in your reading adventures. Enjoy"
4,my review,"While digging the tomb of a Queen, archaeologists find scrolls that indicate the tomb of the Pharaoh. And nobody has ever heard anything about it before, so a race to find the tomb is started by two very different parties....As usual, Wilbur Smith has written an excellent book; he writes history like a novel and I really like that, it makes it much more ""alive"".The subject is very interesting and maintains the reader hooked until the very end. The author has the gift of writing. Every scene is so well presented, you can actually live it while you are reading it! The characters are precise, alive and very human.This book has really been a joy to read. I recomment it to anyone!"
5,Thrilling,I thought this was a real page-turner. Lots of edge-of-your-seat material. Really really good.
2,A Good Book A Little Over shadowed,"found Menage's Way to be a bit overshadowed by the constant sex scenes. I think the plot and characters were strong enough to build an interesting story without so many sex scenes. While I am no master at the drug dealing game, from my research, the content seems to be realistic and believable. Menage Unique Legend is the main character. We travel with him through his life of Benjamins, name brand everything and promiscuity. This combination proceeds to turn his life upside down. One this journey, he learns that material possessions and easy sex is not a part of obtaining true love and a fulfilling life.At the end of this journey, he finds himself and redemption, but at what cost?Rating: 2--Reviewed by Tanya Bates for C&B; Books (2/05)"
4,MATTER OF FACT BOOK,"I would describe this as something of a 'matter of fact book', not a thrill to read. That is not to say it's a bad book by any means, only that it is not written as a great story, but as a narrative of events in Texas City in April 47. The author looks at what happened, how it played out, and who was responsible. The human side of the disaster gets little attention, although there are some notable descriptions from time to time. The disaster is largely attributed to inexperience and complacency in handling explosive chemicals and fertilizer. Readers interested in the subject will likely enjoy this book, but it is far from the last word on what took place at the docks when the Grandcamp and High Flyer exploded."
3,Fugitives from Justice. The notebook of Texas Ranger Gillett,"The service was good, and the book arrived in excellent shape, as promised. The book was loaded with detail, but lacked those things that made it readable, as in story. Cold Hard Facts."
3,Not Sure,"As a wrestling game Simpsons doesnt really cut it but it does provide loads of fun. Simpsons Wrestling has all of the characters from the television show so everyone will be able to choose a player that they like. This game is more based around fun than serious playing, so if you want to wrestle seriously i would recommend that you buy Smackdown2. I feel that they have brought out a lighthearted version to entertain everyone and keep the younger end of the market happy, although i play it and im 23"
3,Ok game at best,"This is definately not a game to buy unless you want all the Simpsons merchandise in the world. It took me about 3-4 hours to beat this game, listen to just about every quote, do all possible matchups and moves. It is just silly how easy it is to beat this game. Ned Flanders has to be pinned twice to lose and he also has the best move in the game which makes the championship round in this game pathetically easy. There is only about 8-10 hidden characters in this game which is also a big disapointment. Itchy and Scratchy dont have any lines. I returned the game to the video store the 2nd day I had it cause i had done everything there is to do in this game."
2,Good but not great,"This game for me was a straight impulse buy since I love the Simpsons. I was hoping for this game to reflect of the show as being good but it was only OK. At first it was good, the humor in it and all. Then as I went to the tournment, I noticed my moves were limited. Along with the lack of moves the game gets increasingly difficult. Of course games are suppose to be difficult but this was too much. When I got up to Smithers I couldn't even get a punch off! Outof 10 fights, at least, I won 1. My advice is not to buy but if you want to find out for yourself, you might think different."
4,make you feel good and want to try every workout at once,"I started to workout few months ago (I think I'm still in average-fit condition). I tried Callanetics, Firm parts(standing legs), and this QuickFix. Each one has its unique merit. Till now, I especially enjoy to follow this vedio. Every movement is explained very clearly and the moving tempo is moderate (in Firm workout, sometimes it is really hard for me to keep up the moving speed for over 40 mins). Because the tempo is not too fast, I felt like to do another workout after each 10 mins and didn't notice that I probably already did 3 workouts. The counting clock keeps me motivated.This is not a heavy workout tape, so don't be afraid to try it.But if you are looking for really intense workout, you should try the Firm workout vedios.(ps. Firm-more 5 day abs is another good vedio, recommended!!)"
2,Not for beginners or those with limited flexibility,"This DVD is for those who are already in good shape who need some new challenges. It could have been titled ""Quick Toning for Contortionists"". I have bad knees and have been back into exercising for just over a month, and a lot of these moves were very stressful to my joints (a lot of crossing and bending at weird angles). I was very disappointed with the choice of exercises.On the plus side, the directions were very clear, the sound and camera work was good, it was easy to select the segments you wanted and the ladies demonstrating the moves could give Barbie a run for her money. For those who are already firm, toned, and flexible, enjoy."
5,Wow I feel it!,"I'm impressed! I just bought this video mainly for the lower body part of the workout. I did the three buns segment, the leg and arm segment, and the legs segment...and I could barely finish that last ten minutes! This is my second favorite exercise video/dvd... right after Weights II (Francesca Gern...a fabulous body sculpting video that is hard to find). Make sure you warm yourself up before doing this dvd...there is virtually no warm up or cool down!"
5,Great DVD,"9 different exercises, 10 minutes each, all 3 women do great explanation of each move and I feel great after working out!"
5,Lot's of variety in TotalMix,The whole DVD is great. These three ladies work your muscles hard. The DVD is a little testy and tricky to work at first. It's a little difficult going from the main menu.There aren't very many of the workouts that use weights.They focus on alot of isometric moves and resistence. The butt and leg workouts make you BURN!!!
1,ANACHRONISTIC RENDITIONS,"This rendition of Stephen Foster's music would have been foreign to Stephen Foster. Other performances of Stephen Foster, in the style of the mid-nineteenth century period, seem far superior to this."
4,Pretty Good,The pictures in this book are wonderful. The only thing missing is that many but not all of the features in the book are listed on the photographs. Overall one of the better books for Osteology.
4,Excellent for ALL ages,This book was excellent. It has every beanie baby that was ever availible to that date in it. The pictures were great and so was the information. It has different prices for each tag that the beanie was ever made with. The only thing I am dissapointed with is that the beanies should have 1 page each.
4,fairly complete compilation,"This compilation is a real education in Kink-ology. I heard songs seldom heard before and they are very good. I have noticed that it skips when I play it in my car and I'm traversing bumpy roads. Don't know the reason for that. The only song that's missing from this album is ""Come Dancing"". The rest are all there and the Kinks have an abundant list of hits to keep you rocking."
1,DON'T BUY!,"I ordered 2 of these and had to immediately return 1 for exchange. Since then both the original 1 and the exchange one have started leaking!Although the concept of having a shut-off lever for filling is a great idea, it simply doesn't work! All 3 of them leaked from the lever slot - good idea - BAD design!"
1,do not buy,"The best thing about this book is the cover. It is very shallow in real use information. The diagrams are not legible and are poor copies of the original Ford diagrams. The photos are not for the ""how to"" crowd. The photos are just pictures of disassembled parts with no or few directions. The instructions are just assembly notes and poor ones. The original Ford Manuel that came with the car is better.Restorer's Model A Shop Manual (Motorbooks Workshop)IT IS AN EXPENSIVE WASTE OF YOUR MONEY!"
1,Usless as a real guide,"This book was purchased a couple of years ago in the hope it would give me some help and insight into the world of the Ford Model A and how to ""bring it back"". I thought it was poorly and amateurishly written then and after looking at it again last night, think it is even worse than that!! If you are working on an early 1928 car it may have some use. The engine info is generalized and body information is worse - much is absolutely incorrect. In summation, THERE ARE A LOT BETTER SOURCES OF INFORMATION ON THIS VERY POPULAR AUTOMOBILE"
3,A Start... a slow one at that,"I pre ordered this game about a month before it was released. When I received it I was extremely pleased to finally get a lacrosse video game. After two or three game I found myself getting a little bored with the game as the ""real"" action was very limited. As I said it's a start for the lacrosse die hard but definitely needs to be upgraded in the near future for people to really get into the game. The game need much better graphics and a large dose of realism and ""intellegence"" for the core sports gamers to enjoy it."
4,Great Game! Worth the money!,"This game is a lot of fun. Starting with the graphics, they aren't mindblowing, but this is Playstation. The sound is pretty bad, as the announcer Scott Farell has about 5 or 6 annoying phrases that he says over and over again. However, the gameplay is a blast. The closest thing that I could compare it to is NHL Rock The Rink, which I still play today. It is challenging and is pretty deep as well. The Sudden Death modes are great as well and add some extra replay value to the game. The Bottom Line is that it is fun to play and it plays like lacrosse. For people who say that the game is too fast, well, its an arcade game, so it is supposed to be fast. Besides, Lacrosse isn't a slow sport like baseball. The price tag is excellent at 29.99. I dare someone to find more than a handful of new PLaystation games for only 30 bucks. Go out and buy it, you won't be disappointed!"
4,Not as good as it could be but still fun,"Ok, I have heard some bad reviews and I have heard some good reviews about this game. Today I went ahead and bought it and at first I was dissapointed. The player models are kind of blocky and the commentator is just annoying. Also one of the big things that irked me was that ALL THE GUYS ARE LEFT-HANDED! Enough of the bad stuff lets talk about the good stuff. Blast Lacrosse is fun to play. If you liked NBA Jam and lacrosse then you'll like this. I would really recommend renting this game first though. Maybe we'll get a simulation lacrosse game soon on PS2, X-Box, or Gamecube!"
2,Obviously no lacrosse players at Akklaim,"I hate to say it, I was psyched for a lacrosse game on Playstation but this game is pretty lame. The gameplay is weak, its hard to tell who has the ball, the commentator is a dork....I just dont see how they could have messed this game up.The people at Akklaim must have never seen lacrosse because this game bears little resemblance.My first major complaint is that there are no shot fakes, then there is the faceoff where you stand, then there is the fact that its nearly impossible to make a pass. You folks at Akklaim need to consult the game writers at EA Sports and do a little research before you release a game that brings a bad name to the great sport of lacrosse.If you ask me, buy the game just so you can play lacrosse on your playstation in hopes that maybe the sales will bring a possible lacrosse game to PS2.Hopefully by another company and some people who have played or seen this sport before."
2,LAME,"If you play lax as much as I do, You are probably stoked for this game as I was. I think this is The absolute worst game Ive ever played. In lacrosse there is 3 attacks, 3 midis, 3 defenders and a golie. In this game there are 4 runners and a goalie. I was hoping this would be something like an NHL game by EA. But this has taught me that I should never buy acclaim. They just cant make sport games. So If I was anyone wanting to buy buy thiis game I would use the money and give it to the person you absolutely hate. Because that is a better investment than buying this game."
2,Very Disappointed,"Since there are no other lacrosse video games, I was really looking forward to this game. Since I play indoor lacrosse, I was hoping it would capture some of the art and excitement of the game. Instead, Acclaim produces a game that can best be described as ""WWF Meets the NLL."" The graphics are so poor you sometimes can't distiguish between teams. The game play is hard to follow. There are NO penalties or even rules for that matter! In addition, the commentary from Farell is outright degrading. ""C'mon! Kick him! Kick him in the head!"", has no place in lacrosse. I'm glad that Acclaim developed a lacrosse game but they totally missed their mark. They should create a game that is closer to NHL 2001 in style and play. It should also be PC based and targeted to older and intelligent demographics. Buy it to send a message that lacrosse games are worth creating but for no other reason."
5,Nothing's Changed,"This MagLITE, as are all Mags I own, is a great flashlight. It's built like a brick and either the LED or the krypton bulb will emit a very bright beam."
2,"Choppy, frantic, and a bit dull.","After catching up to Go On and liking it, we decided to check out Episodes 1 and 2 of Cougar Town, hoping we had missed another post-Friends success for the Friends cast.We hoped to see a bit more witty dialog to this, and after waiting years to first catch it, had expectations that it might be more watchable.But while the premise had promise, the reparte was lacking. The editing was choppy, and the soundtrack sound effects got annoying after about 1&1/2 episodes.So this one is out."
4,Courtney Is Unbelievably Hilarious,"Just like a bag of Ruffles potato chips, you can't eat just one! I am serious! this show is really funny and shocking at times. I would sit and watch at least 4 episodes back to back. Crazy I know but I wanted more. I really love all of the actors on this show. They each are special in their own unique way! :) Even at times this show makes me think about my own life and laugh about it! I cannot wait until Season 2 comes out!"
1,not fun,"Graphics are horrid and over the shoulder view shows too much shoulder. There are much better shooters out there, unfortunately I only know of one, Doom, that is first person and not third person. But so much better gameplay."
4,Excellent Guide to Style--Poor section on color coordination,"Flusser does a great job outlining the classical 1930's style of dressing that is the standard for well-dressed men in the US and Britain. His work is the definitive one, and his prose is interesting. The pictures are outstanding.A couple shortcomings that caused me to rate it a 4--first, his section on color coordination is far too brief, although he does give the principles or coordinating color with hair, skin, eyes, etc. This is something that is usually overlooked in the mass of details on this subject in other fashion books. Second, some key points are hidden in his eloquent sentences while they would be more accessible if they were bullet-pointed. For example, I didn't realize that a dinner jacket should have one button, although I had read his section on the topic fairly carefully."
2,Revolver Waistband Holster,"This holster fit my firearm great, however the clip is made of cheap plastic that isnt rigid enough to stay secure. When the firearm is drawn, the holster comes with it..... This holster would be PERFECT, if that clip was made of metal."
4,A wonderfull watch,"I bought from Amazon com. the DZ 7035 watch that according to my opinion is a wonderful sports watch, because of it's modern design and it's nice leather bracelet with the strange and also very convinient clasp. A lot of people have asked me about that watch. I had the same before and I was very happy wearing that, but when, one day, fell down the floor very strongly, unfortunately it crashed down. So, I decided to order the same one from Amazon com. The price was very good, but unfortunately, I didn't know that, leaving in Greece, I had to pay taxes which they coasted me the double and more than the initial price of the watch. And that is my complain, because nobody from the site informed me about the taxes I had to pay.Anyway, what done is done, I have my watch now again, which is excellent and very nice. The package came in Greece at a very short time and with very good delivery. I propose to buy that watch, if you live in the USA.Fouli Theodoridou, Greece"
4,Great but could be better,This is a beautiful and wonderful game! And I heavilly recommend it. The only problem is that it goes from easy to really hard. It is very fun and the graphics are AMAZING! The music is good too. I recommend this to anyone who has a GBA and doesn't like a lot of text on the screen.
2,Muskido's Intuition,"Personally, I think this game is horrible. A few bonus levels are fun, but the rest is generally hard to admire. This game is only good for those of you who are really hardcore platform players. The game is hard, keeps you frustrated at timing that jump half a second off, and is not as fun as many expect."
2,Not For ME,"I expected this to be just another clone of Mario and I was seurprised to see it was very different. While the game is very creative and the graphics are excellent, the gameplay is very repetitive and seems to be designed for very young children and unlike mario which has incredible replay vaue do to tons of secret levels and items, this game is a little too straightforward. ITs an okay game I just think it needs a little reworking to achieve the level of Mario"
1,"Big No, No","Rayman, is not very entertaining. The graphics aren't all that great either. I highly regret wasting my money on such a crapy game. The game has no solid point or goal. This game is side-scroling. However, if you like Rayman forgive me saying such bad things about this game, but I am trying to help people save their money for games that really entertain you. The game hardly gets harder as you go up in level, and the levels are horrible, they are all easy, boring, and they don't have very hard enemies. This game is definitally for gamers who don't like video games, but who have nothing better to do. If you still want this game, it may seem fun at first but adventually you will feel the same way about this game as I did."
3,yes,"A descent record, none of the songs are as good as the title track. But most songs are good with a couple clunkers. Every song is quite a bit different than the others,in that respect I would say this is a good record."
2,Police and Thieves,"I was recommended this album to expand my reggae collection as a classic produced with the famous Lee ""Scratch"" Perry. Having never listened to any other Junior Murvin, I have to say I was a little disappointed- the beats and lyrics are quality, but his falsetto singing voice soon made me realize I wouldn't be adding this to my favorites collection. I would recommend the little known Gladiators Trenchtown Mix Up instead of this cd if you're looking for an excellent reggae collection."
1,I wasted my money,"This game has to be played with Steam. If you check the reviews on-line, most persons want to play without downloading Steam. I was looking for a game that can be installed and played (as easy as that). Too much work to install and play. This is foolishness."
4,a little depth for the youth,"i loved MISTA when they originally debuted when I was in Jr. High. My favorite was Bobby. When I heard ""Slow Down,"" and saw the video, my first inclination was, ""was this the Bobby who showed promise from MISTA?"" It was! Just as nice as his voice is displayed now, so too is the group. It is too bad they don't come back with a single now, but this CD has great cuts. From ""Lady,"" to ""I Think that I should Be."" Most of the songs are ballads, but they aren't too played out in 2005. I own 2 copies of the CD...not by choice, but still I won't give one of them away. I also like the song ""Tears, Scars & Lies,"" a very slow ballad. what I appreciate most about MISTA is their depth at such a young age. It makes them credible for the future. If you don't already have it, there's no need to cop it for full price...but if you have $5 and it's on sale on Amazon, I say please add it to your collects."
5,We STILL love this music,"I bought this when my 10 year old was a baby. It is calm, soothing and more fun to rock a baby to than any other ""lullaby"" CD. My youngest (she's 8) still listens to it every night. I enjoy giving it as a baby gift for new ""rockers"" to enjoy!"
4,Dedicated to the one I love - Linda Ronstadt,This is an extremely creative children's album using modern rock songs interpreted as lullabies. Ms. Ronstadt's voice is impeccable and the execution is fabulous. Linda Ronstadt never ceases to amaze me as to her musical vision and prowess. I would recommend this album to anyone (with or without children).
5,Perfect for parents and babies,"This is a beautiful transformation of rock standards into lullabies, perfect for frazzled parents and insomniac babies. Those who complain about ""We Will Rock You"" seem to be stuck in the mode of thinking there's only one proper way to interpret a song (and by the way, the lyric is ""you've got mud on your face,"" not ""blood,"" and if you have toddlers, they've probably got all kinds of stuff on their face). Personally, I think Linda Ronstadt's version of this tune is an excellent example of how a different context can change a song's meaning and interpretation. ""Winter Light"" is gorgeous, and a song that gave my mother deep peace and relaxation in the last few months of her life. So it means a lot for me for my little son to hear that song now. Whoever said this CD is ""terrible"" may not have had the right audience in mind--it's not something you groove to at parties, but it has its time and place."
5,Best baby lullabyes ever,I've purchased 6 copies of this cd to give as new baby gifts. My daughter swears it was the only thing that worked to get my grandson to sleep.
5,No solo un cd para bebes...,"Linda interpreta los temas con una voz suave y relajante. Ideal para olvidarnos por un momento de los problemas diarios. No solo un cd para bebes, sino un cd para todos. Gracias, Linda!!!"
1,this is the worst,"I love mathematics and read math book of all sorts, including textbooks. I teach music theory (which is similar to math) at the college level, and have been doing so for the last 18 years. This is the worst math book I have ever seen. Where are the brillant proofs of Euclid? This is a hodgepodge of history, so-called music, and diverse topics thrown into one book, that consists of mearly formulaes and prove it yourself theorems. The Pythagorean formula is circular, if you can follow it back far enough. There are no concepts or brillant ideas, only ""you do it this way"" as in the old calculus books. The authors are all school teachers, with one college teacher (wow). The school teachers have been complaining for years about how bad the ""new math"" was when the mathematicians wrote the texts; now it is their turn and they have turned my child off to math by their dull pedantic book. I think all schools should review this book before using it."
3,Not too durable.,"Lettering get mushed and distorted after a few months. But it's cheap enough to justify buying again. So, next time I'll just get 2 or 3 packs at the same time."
2,"Low quality printing, incorrect characters","These stickers have very low quality printing, some of them have a blurry shadow, as if they were printed twice. Besides that, and that's the worst, one the bracket keys has an error, it's printed with ""} ["", instead of ""} ]"". Huge mistake. The pictures you see here on amazon are not from the actual product. They should change that ""quality"" motto."
2,"looked nice, inexpensive but flimsy","The reason I needed keyboard stickers is because I type many keystrokes a day and my letters wear off, and then other get frustrated using my computer.These stickers looked nice in the photos and when I received them. They were easy to apply. They were not expensive at all, but unfortunately they are also a bit flimsy and with someone who types as much as I do, they just started sort of flaking off after a couple of weeks with little plastic threads. I can still type but I'm going to look into something else a little pricier that will be longer lasting.If you don't type a lot, this probably would not be a problem, but then I would wonder why you would need keyboard replacement stickers to begin with"
1,Looks Great When New,"The stickers look great when they are first applied but the problem is that they do not last long at all. The letters do not stay forever! The letters fade within days. Do not purchase, do not waste your money. You will be disappointed!"
5,adds new life to a worn out keyboard,I applied these to my old SONY laptop keyboard and so far they are working perfectly. I cleaned the keys with isopropyl alcohol before applying the stickers and they adhere well. They make the keyboard look new plus the letters are brighter than the original key letters; I can see them more easily and clearly. I ordered 3 sheets of these in case they wear off but they seem to be more rugged than the original key lettering. I am very pleased with them and recommend them if you're tired of looking at worn-off naked blank laptop keys.UPDATE: It's now April and these keyboard stickers are still going strong even after extensive everyday use. None have peeled off and the letters are as bright and easy to see as they were back in January when I first applied them. I think cleaning the keys with alcohol before applying them helps them to adhere so well. I'm still very pleased with these keyboard stickers and I'm glad I bought them.
4,Not perfect but still worth it.,"Not a bad read. If you want some guidlines as to where to go and what to do it's a good start. I love the fact that it not only has busness names but phone numbers as well! The directions arn't that good aparently even the Japanese people have a hard time finding their way around Tokyo. It also has some Japanese words that you can learn in the back of the book. For example, Hi what's your name? and What time is it? and do you have any rooms availible? I have personally never been to Japan but with this book I think I will be more confadent. One more note, Buy the full Frommer's Japan book not the Tokyo edition. I Have both of them and the full Japan edition has the same info and tons more than the simple little Tokyo edition."
4,Old Friends Return...,"This one hour, made for TV special is Dorothy's animated return to the land of OZ. Although now 40 years old, the film will delight young fans of OZ and bring back memories to those who remember this newly refound, classic animated story. Dorothy returns to Oz (via an fruit tree this time) and once again must battle the Witch of the West, once a puddle now a witch again, for the ownership of the Silver Slippers (no rubies here folks). The animation is typical of it's time; stylized and sparse with muted tones. Still, it's well done and features some great voice work on the part of the cast. Like it's more famous inspiration, the film features some well crafted music for Dorothy and company to sing. A definate treat for young audiences that deserves to be refound by adult fans of the legend of the Land of Oz."
4,EXCELLENT!!!,"I'm almost 13 years old and I thought this game was great! I rented it and I just wanted to rent it over and over again. For a person like me, I went through it pretty quick, but it was a lot of fun! You go through different levels of a mall and play several mini-games featuring all of the Rugrat characters. Then you win certain items for winning those games and show them off in a fashion show featuring Angelica. Then you get scores from the judges and total them up to go to the next floor. It's great for all girls at all ages, because it's about what girls like best.....tha mall!!!! I personaly think this is a cool game. GET IT!!!"
1,Two Girlfriends Get Real About Cosmetic Surgert,"I received this book today and was interested in breast augmentation. A couple of things bothered me. First, they only really discuss insertion of the implant through the armpit although this is not the most common insertion. So that really didn't help at all with comparisions. Then, when they discuss the hardening due to scar tissue around the implant, they say that the first treatment is manual compression by the plastic surgeon to break up the scar tissue. Everything else I have read says that most plastic surgeons refuse to do this because of possible damage to the implant and that this can void the warranty.I don't know what they say about any other procedures because I stopped reading after this section and am going to return the book immediately."
4,Fentastic work,It is nicely wriiten and subjects are well arrenged. I thank the author for his good work.
1,Horrible music,"The music that accompanies this video could best be described as jazzy. I do not want to listen to jazz music when I practice yoga. Also, the whole video is just a bunch of standard sun salutation sequences with a few super difficult poses (that not even my yoga instructors can do) thrown in. The cover makes it look like you do dancer's pose in this video but you do not. I am in my twenties and my back hurt after doing repetitive camel poses. I would not recommend this product to anyone."
3,Interesting and a must have for Erasure completists!,"I was always kind of bummed that ""Knocking on Your Door"" never made it on the greatest hits album. At a brief 2.55 couldn't they have fit it on there somewhere? Anyway ""The Hardest Part"" is not a remake of the famous BLONDIE song (playing time 3.38). It sounds better after repeated listenings. ""She Won't Be Home"" is a lovely Christmas ballad (playing time 3.27). ""STOP"" Remix has a 5.44 playing time, while the ""Knocking On Your Door"" Remix has a 6.03 playing time (a little long but the first version I ever heard -- at a club in 1988). I bought the ep at the time and just now got the cd because I had an itch to have ""Knocking on Your Door"" on cd. Its nice that this cd is still in print."
3,Got Crackers?,"""Stop!"" is one of my favorite Erasure songs. Upbeat and melodic, it's a classic. The 12"" version is ok. ""The Hardest Part"" is a mid tempo track that is simple and sweet. ""She Won't Be Home,"" with a Holiday theme is mellifluous and light, a gem. The versions of ""Knocking On Your Door"" are fair, I liked the other songs better..."
4,That's the Hardest Part of it all...,"If you have not heard this CD, go back up to the sound samples and take a listen to the clip of ""The Hardest Part"". There's something about that song that's...that's...well, anyway it made me want to buy the album. Stop! is a fine song, reminding me a bit of Drama! but not close to as good. Knocking on Your Door certainly isn't bad either, but stick either of these songs on an album like Chorus and they'd be the low points of the disc. The remixes are an interesting touch, and I think the Stop remix improves the song, adding extra sound effects and beats, while Knocking on Your Door's remix serves simply to drag out the song and make it boring. The other track, She Wont Be Home, is my second favourite from this CD and was really quite fitting to me (since I ended up recieving this album for Christmas!). Anyway, I reccomend this disc to add to your collection. For me, the Hardest Part of it all was to stop playing that song over and over and over and..."
1,Harris quarter album,This is a piece of junk. Harris company should have never had their name on it. It is poorly made and will not withstand the weight of the coins. There are only 2 rivets holding the binding. Should be 3. The binding is made of cheap thin plastic. The ends of the pages are very thin paper. Do not waste your money on this product.
5,excellent quality and nice presentation,"I am new to coin collecting and have not seen many other state quarter albums. However I am very pleased with this one. It is hardcover, with reinforced edges, archival quality. There are 5 thick cardboard pages with 20 coins on each page. Each quarter fits very snug and stays put. A thin sheet of plastic on each side of the quarters prevents them from falling out. It also has space for both P and D coins which is a plus. The whole look is very professional and durable. There is a brief history of the quarter on the inside cover but other than that there is no further information about the states."
5,"Good product, but needs instructions","I have found this product to be pretty sturdy, coins fit snugly and are not difficult to remove if necessary (just slide out the plastic protective covers and pop it out). Coins display nicely, visible on both sides, and there are slots for both Philadelphia and Denver mints. The only suggestion I have is that it should come with instructions. Not being an avid coin collector, I wasn't quite sure how to use this product at first. I found that it worked best if I removed the top plastic protective covers, pushed the coins into the slots, and then slid the top plastic covers back in. Overall, I am happy with this product."
5,Waiting For It is Absolutely Amazing!,"Waiting For It is a brilliantly, exhilarating read. I can't think of another author who can match Ms. Byrd's powerful, breathtaking style. This deeply romantic story will leave you speechless except for one word --- MORE!"
1,Gave me a rash on my face,Received as a gift in a set of products. I used last night for 1st time and today awoke to itchy red angry bumps and swelling around my eyes and mouth (where it had been applied). Won't be using again.
1,THIS GAME IS OK FOR PRE-SCHOOLERS,"This game has pretty good graphics but is way to easy to beat. If you dont have a life than you can have a goood tiime ppplaying ths game. But if you are an experienced gamer like me this game is not for you. This game is way to easy to beat and you can go onto the internet to get the codes so it sorta ruins it. If you have your heart set on buying this game than buy it used and save 15 dollars. So in other words this game is fun but 1,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000 times 8,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000 to easy for an experienced gamer DONT'T BUY IT!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!"
4,The REAL Gundam...,"Mobile Suit Gundam 0079, drawn and written by Kazuhisha Kondo, is the Manga adaption of the original Mobile Suit Gundam, produced in 1979, and has absolutely nothing to do with 1995's New Mobile Report Gundam W, known in the US as Mobile Suit Gundam Wing. Volume 1, which is approximately equivilant to the first 11 episodes of the series, is almost a direct adaption, and is reccomended for the fans of the original, as it has far more material than was seen in the Anime Village release of the three compilation movies. While at times it seems a bit on the silly side, and the art is definitely late 70's style, it's a very good manga. My only complaint is that Kondo's rendering of Yoshihaku Yashuhiro's character designs leaves a lot to be desired..."
2,not so great,"i bought it for ""popular,"" as did many people, and i was dissapointed in it. a lot. they jumped on the comet tail of grunge and are nowhere near as spectacular as the original. the only redeemable song on the album is ""zen brain,"" the closing track. that song has a lot of emotion put into it and seems much more heartfelt than the rest of the album."
3,"Lots of fun, but not great","A lot of the songs here start well, but most deteriorate quickly into low-end grunge. But this is redeemed by the great tracks 'The Plan' and 'Popular'. All of the songs have odd lyrics, and a lot of loud guitars with heavy feedback."
3,A reader,"This fascinating book is based on a national survey of 75,000 parents--the largest name research project ever. It reveals the images and stereotypes associated with 1,400 popular and unusual names. Find out what people think of the names your considering, so you don't make a harmful mistake. This invaluable book reduces the worry of picking a name for your baby. And, it's entertaining to read. A must for every new parent."
4,Hawaii in 1953,"Rita Hayworth is great in this, but another reason to watch the movie is to see unspoiled, wild Kauii in 1953, beautifully shot in Technicolor. So intoxicatingly lush. Make use of the photographic aspect of Hollywood movies, I say! The energy of the soldiers and native islanders is also vividly conveyed. The old motor boats and cruise ship are also a treat. There's a lot of details to like about this movie. (On the downside, the insufferable Jose Ferrer is really bad in this role (mailed in), and didn't live up to his role. He was nowhere nearly as effecdtive as previous actors in the part.) This version also shows a single woman in a more modern world than the previous versions, a point of interest until Sadie gets pulled down by her past."
4,Excellent product received but was very slow to ship,"Ordered and receivd the DVD ""Miss Sadie Thompson"", a Region 2 DVD. This DVD is not available in Region 1 for the USA market. The DVD case and cover was retail quality and the picture quality on playback was very good. My only complaint was the shipping time it took to receive the item. It took 3 1/2 weeks from the date it was ordered until received (North Carolina to California). Other than that I have no other complaints. Good quality merchandise as one would expect to receive."
1,Smartbombs,"New Yorker goes to the Left Coast, doesn't understand what she sees and hears, writes quotes out of context and without any insight or understanding into the logic or philosophy behind those quotes, insults the talented people she's interviewing because they aren't fashionable enough for her (and apparently that's crucial for writing a book), then gives them a hug and says she likes being their friend. Couldn't she have gleaned real insight from having spent substantial time with these fascinating people?"
1,Building & Managing a World Class IT Help Desk,So basic it was insulting. I kept reading thinking the author would give more detail. Not sure who this book is geared towards as the technology sections are weak too.
3,cannot read pounds only killograms,soem one should warn you that this scale displays kgs as a primary and pounds as secondary the pound are displayed are almost totatlly hidden unde the wooden platform You must bend totally backwoards to see it and for some family members this is impossible .Although lovely to look at it is impossible to read
1,i was fooled,i bought this cam thinking it was a good choice however it started out working great but know it sticks i took some realy great photos and by the time i got home i tried i vane to upload them and i could not ever since this cam sticks every time .in my own words this cam stinks i fell like just slaming it against a wall but i paid money for it. i hope i can get a refund or something .if you see this cam do not i stress do not buy it its no good.a ordinary cam user.
3,good for a first,"I liked how that I dropped this camera on the floor to concrete like 5 or 6 times, and it has been hit by a basket ball and still it works!! The video's on this camera are pretty pixelized, they are not choppy though. And the fact that rechargable batteries dont work on it. YOU BETTER GET ENOUGH LIGHT THIS IS AN OUTDOOR CAMERA! And unless you have a VERY bright home, go outside with this, I must say you get a little more than what you pay for. GOOD CAMERA IF IT IS YOUR FIRST ONE!"
4,it is nice,I like it very much it is as fun as the firstone but the music is diffrent and so are a lot of the levels and they put new ones ENJOY
2,Bad Black Gold,"Having read Daniel Yergin's epic on the oil industry (The Prize) I was expecting much much more from this DVD. I must say after viewing its less than 1 hour effort I am utterly disappointed. To begin with, Amazon.com should make it mandatory for each DVD on sale to state the length of the production. This is basic product information and I wonder why we need to get this information from customer reviews when available. After a 5 hour ""The Story of India"" and a 4-disc ""The Universe"" my expectations were for a 2 hour presentation at the least.This DVD has not enough coverage and depth for its price. It focused mainly on the origins of oil in the USA and thereafter demands for it, firstly for kerosene lighting and thereafter during the automobile craze in the USA. It largely ignored the development of the oil industry in Persian Gulf countries, Mexico, South Amercia and parts of Asia and the politics surrounding oil during World War II."
3,Story of Oil,Good historical review of the importance of oil in our society. Somewhat simplified with little insight of political and industrial importance.
5,"A Compendium of Good Ole Fashioned ""COOL STUFF"" Stuffed Into One Book","This is an EXCELLENT resource for the student of folklore, mythology, the occult, or anyone interested in the origin of our stories, myths, legends, and important symbologies. Reformatting of the book from the original text provides the reader with a more smooth and thorough definition. Useful illustrations come in handy as well when a visual guide is necessary. All in all a great addition to my occult library."
4,Now Quite Happy with This Product,"I now maintain a bi-monthly subscription to this tea. The tea comes loose, which is the way I like it for my tea pots. The very best Jasmine pearl green tea sells for $80-$100 a pound. I enjoy having a genuine jasmine experience at a more affordable price. My first order came with individually wrapped servings (about a teaspoon in each plastic package, which you have to cut open to put the loose tea in your cup). This is no longer the case. I drink this tea iced (sorry, authentic tea lovers). It is just healthier and more soothing for me than other drinks. It is affordable enough to share with friends, who are always amazed. I wouldn't be without it. Excellent value for the price."
1,Response: Mandy C.,"Fictional or not this book should not have been directed towards his own tribe! This book may protect the authors intentions by labeling it a fictional book, but those who RESIDE and INTERACT on a DAILY basis with the government and people of the KICKAPOO NATION, know the feelings behing these falacies of a man who does not LIVE with the Kickapoo people or suffer the consequences of the past tribal council members. Before you begin to use personal words of attack and labeling a person as being NAIVE, try looking up the spelling and definition first! This book does nothing to portray his people in a way that is respectful, nor does it give any insight to the corruption on his behalf as well! DO NOT waste money on a book that is a personal plot to humiliate his own tribe!"
1,What the hell!?,y an alternate universe where Pangea was still intact and what do i get?!a crappy little cd... this sucks...
4,Love it All-in-one,"I love it, we placed this LCD in our bathroom, works great, Love the fact reciever is internal !! Very convient for odd locations. Got mine for $220, 2 years ago off ebay. Still working great. Wish I could find another one !!"
5,Thanks For A Great Book Shelly!!!,"This book is so jammed pack full of great information I don't know where to start. I've always wanted to write and found this book. It is great! It gave me so many ideas about what I could do, offered all the information about each opportunity....and then unlike many other books, it actually gave tips for getting the great jobs. I had a couple questions, went to Shelly's website and she answered them via e-mail. I have many of Field's books. I love the way she formats them. It makes it easy to find just what you're looking for. It is pretty evident to me why she is one of the leading career consultants in the country. I'm so excited. I just received my first check for a freelance writing assignment and can't wait to see my byline. Thanks Shelly. You wrote a great book for people interested in writing as a career or as a sideline. I wish I could give it 100 stars."
3,Not as good.,This series was NOT as good as the first. Since the orignal actor died and they used someone else it's just NOT the same. Also you can buy it much cheaper at Walmart brand new for only 19.98 with NO SHIPPING CHARGES.
1,"like Spartacus and Rome, just for the kiddies and machos","There's a lot of blood and seems to be sex in this kind of series...well i don't like it, i always compare it with the ""Tudors"" and that's on another level, there are good actors and a storyline, well something like a script. In this kind of films you only find a lot of crap and a language full of primitive words, that's not how people in previous times have spoken, believe me!!! Please scriptwriters deliver more good taste!"
5,Spartacus: Gods of the Arena,I can't get enough! Best series in a long time! The characters are so easy to get close to and the story line is addictive. You'll be glued to the screen!
5,It was a present,Just what my daughter wanted. I have never seen this show. I understand it is very good and it was what she wanted
5,Great Movie,So worth seeing and owning this movie. My husband and I both enjoyed Spartacus very much. A must see movie.
4,Most entertaining show - fabulous!,"Too bad we lost Andy Whitfield. Dustin Clare and Whitfield made The Gods of the arena and Spartacus blood and sand.The Spartacus Vengence does not have the panache,the exitement that the first two episodes provide."
4,An excellent prequel to season 1,This is a great addition to the Spartacus series. I find it to be an excellent prequel to season 1.
3,Interesing Prequel,"This is a great prequel to what happens on SPARTACUS--with great production values and superb acting, I found the series highly engaging--even with the amount of violence. It's not something I normally like, so it was an unexpected treat to view it. If you're a fan of THE 300 or GLADIATOR, you'll enjoy this great set of discs!"
3,Something you might not know about,"Billy Lawrence is a singer that I think alot of people really missed out on. The voice is unique and when you hear it, you can say ""THAT is billy"".I gave the album 3 stars instead of 4 only because of a couple tracks that people would like to call fillers. But songs like ""chances are"", ""come on"", and ""foot steps"" NEED to be heard. Great songs, good album, I suggest this one for something different to add to your collection."
5,Paradise,"I love this CD. I had it once before, but I lost it when I moved. I knew that Amazon.com was the best place to find it. I feel the same way I did when I first got this CD. I can relate to all of the songs. She is a good writer and singer. I wonder if she is coming out with an album for 2008."
3,Come On,This CD is pretty good but i bought it thinking the rest of the songs would be like Come On which they aren't. The other songs are slow and ballad-like. It's worth a try though if you like that sort of thing!
3,Package smaller than expected.,Product arrived & I was expecting the package to be bigger. Vendor should put cubic inches or dimensions in the product description so that buyer knows better what they're getting. This package won't last long. A little disappointed. Product is good quality.
3,Not for the casual hiker,"This is a beautifully illustrated book - I'll certainly give it that. I didn't get into the prose, though, because as I thumbed through the summary description of each hike, I was disappointed to find how few of them are accessible to the casual hiker.I'm going to Seattle in mid-May and I wanted to take a few hikes while I was there. Of the 100 hikes listed in this book, less than 5 of them are accessible in May, and all of those are either on the coast or east of the Cascades. The weather isn't the authors' fault, but one would hope there would be a few ""classic"" hikes that would be accessible at other times than mid-summer.The other disappointment was that a very large percentage of the hikes involve trips of multiple days. I'm sure they're gorgeous, but this borders more on camping trips than hikes.I foundFoghorn Outdoors Washington Hiking: The Complete Guide to More Than 400 Hikes (Foghorn Outdoors)to be a much more useful guide."
5,Very Detailed,"Loved this, very detailed and helpful for finding hidden and beautiful trails! Would suggest this book to anyone interested in hiking Washington."
3,A good mystery-adventure book with a loveable cat hero.,"This is a good whodunit book and the main cat character, Big Mike is a hoot. The human female character is less well done than the cat. She is a bit one dimensional. The plot is pretty good and the descriptions are good. It doesn't lag in the action and is an all around good writing job."
4,Good basic set - and a great price!,"I've had this set for a few weeks now and, from what I have been able to tell, this is a good, durable set. I can't speak for the comments regarding the finish not lasting, but I have used the saucepan, the larger pots and the frying pan on a semi-daily basis and they hold up very well.I would recommend this for everyday use in kitchens, and you can't beat the price."
3,SWEET CD.........BUT KINDA DISAPPOINTED,"its a good cd no doubt but these are the core songs that shoulda been on it. hip to be square,new drug,heart of rock and roll,back in time,stuck with you,if this is it,power of love. theres a few i named that are notably absent and its not like they werent HUGE hits! but on a good note, i did like their version of ""it's alright"". great song and they can sing their butts off."
3,This is the Best?,"Okay, so Huey Lewis & The News wasnt the biggest band of the 80s, but with the success of ""Back to the Future,"" they were pretty popular and had some decent hits. This is supposed to be a collection of, ""The Best"" of Huey Lewis & the News, but h0ow can it be ""the best when it is missing some of their BIGGEST hits?Noticeably absent:""Hip to be Square""""Back in Time""How can it be a greatest hits collction when it's missing two of their biggest? Huey Lewis wasn't big enough to warrant a second volume of their greatest hits, so everything should be available on one disc.It's likely they couldn't secure the rights to ""Out of Time"" but I find that odd considering Power of Love was also from the ""Back to the Future"" soundtrack and they got that. Regardless of whether they could get the rights to the song, the fact that it is missing makes this CD lacking, and not truely deserving of the title ""Best of."""
3,"Great music, but too much missing","One of the best and most fun groups of the 80s. But there's some good stuff missing: Walking on a Thin Line, Jacob's Ladder, I Know What I Like, Hip To Be Square. They should have included these and left off the four new ones. For my money, it would be better to have the original CDs."
4,Numero Uno !,"Another excellent disc from the Threadgill Sextett, a ""little big band"" adds nice rich texture 3 horns sax, trombone, trumpet and the a big propulsive rhythm section bass, cello, 2 drummers really cook all the way through ""Bermuda Blues"" is the single most cachiest track Ive heard by the composer, ""YKNTN"" one of 3 strong albums came out on RCA, some of his best work of the 1980s. These major label goons when will they wake up ? still NO CD reissue ?? whats going on, put this on CD now !"
5,A must have addition to the Catholic Library,"There is no excuse for any Catholic to misunderstand the Catechism after reading this book. It is easy to understand and with the reputation of this author, it should allay any fears of being misled in doctrinal interpretation."
2,Bare Minimum Requirements for a Starter Scope,"This scope is as very basic starter scope. Here's why:1. The objective is 80 mm, just over 3.1 inches, so it is jsut adequate to bring in the light necessary for a beginning look at the universe. It is adequate for the moon, and beginning views of the larger planets. The planets will appear as small disks. One will be able to see Saturn's rings, and Jupiter's moons, but the images will be very small. Some deep sky objects will be visible, but faints and fuzzy.2. The mount will vibrate when touched, which will cause the image in the eyepiece to ""shiver"", which is very frustrating to the observer.If additional funds are available, I'd opt for a larger scope with a better mount. Kids will be satisfied with this scope however.Jim ""Konedog"" Koenig, astronomy buff"
5,Soft & WRM,"The wool felt insoles keep your feet very warm. They are bulky and they made the boots I bought them for too tight. However, I put them in another pair of boots that had been a little too roomy and now the boots are perfect and even more comfortable. It's like waking on warm and toasty clouds. They are wide. I went to a party last night where I had to stand a lot and it was really great with that extra padding."
5,Toad Catchers Creek,"The colors, graphics and positive message is why I would recommend this book to anybody that has kids."
1,"This is NOT, I repeat NOT for all babies","This is NOT, I repeat NOT for all babies! Had a friend who used this method and her childs eardrum burst from crying from ear ache! We humans slept together for hundreds of years. What a load of garbage, about independence. Children get that from self confidence and loving, nurturing care. We had a community bed for both boys and both are extremely independent individuals with strong sense of self and NO sleep problems!"
4,"CIO method, but otherwise alot of good sleep info.","My daughter is 2 1/2 months old and I won't do cry it out method with her , at least not now. This book strongly recommends a graduated cry it out method. Other than this part of the book, it is a very interesting book. I have learned alot about sleep, habits, associations, problems etc and how to solve them. I think with an older child that has really bad sleep issues the graduated cry it out method may be the best approach but for my baby right now it is not what something that I will do, nor do I think it would be kind or appropriate. This book does say that if your baby is less than 4 months old that most of the time you should wait and give it some time to see if the issues work themselves out and only after 4 months try the graduated cry it out method if issues still exist. Otherwise a very interesting book with a lot of helpful info on sleep."
4,Good Advise if Your Child had Problems Sleeping,"If your child is having troubles sleeping and is older than 3 months old, this book does have good advise and an interesting theory about sleep. However if your child isn't really having problems a good book that just helps you learn about and understand a baby's and a child's sleep schedule and what to expect from children at different ages, try ""Healthy Sleep Habits, Happy Child."""
1,It didn't Work,"I was diligent with the methods in this book. However, for the first week he got so scared everytime we left he $#^@ his diaper, after a month of this method, my son was falling asleep faster, but still falling asleep crying and sitting up against his crib rails; he was beside himself in emotional pain; and it made him more anxious and clingy during the day, because he felt abandoned by his parents when he needed them. I had specific problems for which there were no answers in this book. It is not right for every baby. However, less intense, laid back children may respond to this well. I think you have to know your child and do what is right for them. I have had better success with more sensitive methods."
2,"While it sounds easy, this method was tough and did not work for us","While the theory behind this method sounds simply, it was extremely difficult and we never got past the first stages as our son vomited all over the place as soon as we let him cry for a minute or longer.It did not work for us and we are trying a different method."
2,I think its a good book...but,"I have been trying to get through this book, but for a sleep-deprived mommy of a 2 month-old, its not an easy read. I need simple steps to follow -- this is way too complicated."
1,not needed,"Did not work, could not see the screen. Just get one of those screen covers and call it a day."
3,Harold And Kumar Get The Munchies-The Continuing Saga,"A dope dealing Santa. A stoned toddler. Neil Patrick Harris rising from the dead. Your typical day for everyone's favorite ethnic slackers. Most of the gags here are hit or miss though I was beside myself with the parody of ""A Christmas Story"". You get a feeling of ennui watching this movie. Kal Penn and John Cho seem to be going through the motions as if they've outgrown this type of juvenalia. This is not to suggest that they're phoning it in but they don't seem to have the same energy level as they did in the previous installments. The movie is certainly watchable but I can't imagine it becoming a holiday staple. I didn't watch it in 3-D but I can't imagine that making much of a difference."
4,Relax - still your friends from White Castle!,"We had some of the same trepidation that others voiced here - in as much as we found the last installment in the Harold & Kumar trilogy less than enjoyable. We actually had to look the last time because we did not believe 'Guantanamo' was written by the same team that brought us 'White Castle'. Much to our dismay, it was. Don't know what happened there. The good news, however, is that much of the same fun and spirit of Harold & Kumar is back for their Christmas Special! Rest assured that these are the guys you fell in love with on the way to White Castle! NPH does a hilarious turn (again) but sadly, we miss out on Christopher Meloni on this one. I think you can see who he would have been, though. Rent or buy with confidence. While it isn't the original - it has at LEAST 14 or so of the same herbs & spices... Have fun!"
3,"Silly, but fun.","This was a gift for a friend, but we watched it together. I've never seen any of the Harold & Kumar movies, but I knew what to expect. It was silly and fun, just like Christmas movies should be."
4,move over Amon,"amazing. picked it up by chance while in Norway. naturally, #1, #4, #6 are catchy; but dont be misled, handsomely juxtaposed starting with track 9 and on are some brilliant tunes.regards"
2,Warning: this is not a CD!,"First - ""artistic"" rating. The content of DFP's work is very nice and mellow - even though a couple of tracks (like ""Okinawa Love"") leave me perplexed. I'd give it 4 stars.Now, the technical... Contrary to what's advertised on this website, it is not an ""Audio CD"" - as in ""internationally adopted CD standard originally by Philips"" JVC released a crippled non-standard version in the guise of ""copy protection""! The package says it does not play on Macs, and not on DVD players of certain (?) regions (I can't read Japanese). When I try to play it on my PC, it launches Microsoft Media Player and plays tracks at 48kbps (only 48!) - which also means no playing on Linux. Shame on JVC!"
1,Contradictive and Imprecise,"Lesley Downer has mentioned many times in the novel that geisha are not prostitutes and are not viable to associated with the word sex. However, she contradicts this statement by mentioning the mizuage and mirare, all of which mentioning geisha selling their bodies. She also makes many assumptions of the Japanese culture and character, but it seems that she bases all of these off of few accounts rather than vast research. There is also very little emphasis placed on what kinds of geisha she is talking about, because the geisha of Gion Kobu, would never associate themselves with such scandalous and degrading practices.Although it gives facts on history and such, it is greatly cumbersome in identifying the practices of geisha of different locations and classes. Approached most certainly with a Western interpretation, it just seems like a novel with a double entente that contradicts itself. Disappointing."
1,"Way to much punctuation,,,,,,,,,,,,sometimes hard to follow!","I read alot and I've never seen so many commas in a book in all my life! I keep having to go back to re-read a sentence to see if a missed the period somewhere. I've, gotten, about, half, way, through, the, book, and, don't, think, I, can, finish, it!! AHHHH"
5,Mother of 2 girls,"This is a beautifully written and eye-catching book that deals with a very real issue of being a ""hot head"" and saying you're sorry. Both my girls (aged 18 months and 5 years) love this book and want me to read it over and over! I often substitute their names for ""Maddie"" when they are acting like her! Perfect for teaching little ones to think before they act and to consider other's feelings."
4,It's good.,"The grandbaby likes it for a bedtime story, and so I like it, too. It's easy for her to sound out the words, and it is easy to for her to understand the morals of the story."
5,Absolutely the best critique of the Novus Ordo ever written!,"Father Wathen may be the greatest thinker of our times and it shows in this outstanding book. What seemed to be hidden from the eyes of the Church, and the world, in regards to the sacriligious nature of Bugnini's concoction 40 years ago is undeniable today! Fr. Wathen's book has stood the test of time and the conciliarists remain exposed as frauds. Every priest and lay person should read ""The Great Sacrilege"" to learn how their Catholic Faith has been stolen from them since the modernist anti-Catholic forces took away the real Mass.However great this book, Fr. Wathen's follow-up may be his masterpiece - ""Who Shall Ascend?"" is a must read; a must own!"
2,Very flimsy,"My cats broke this within the first hour of it being on the door. It snapped off the base, which is really too bad because they had a lot of fun for the 20 minutes that it lasted!"
1,Awful awful,This is the worst collection of westerns I've ever seen. Don't buy it since it's a waste of time and money.
1,all recipes require author's bottled sauces,disappointing book since all recipes require using Maggie Gins bottled Chinese sauces which seem to be out of production .... not available in our area of CA.Save your money.
1,Worst Bad Company CD ever,Worst Bad Company CD ever. It was actually painful to here what they did to the classic Bad Company songs on this.Even more dissappointing because the previous album Company of Strangers was their best non-Paul Rodgers album.Save your money. Buy the original Bad Company or Free albums.
3,Required reading for my granddaughter,"I purchased The Red Kayak to read while my granddaughter was reading it as a school assignment. It opened up the opportunity for us to discuss right and wrong, peer pressure, and finding the strength to do what YOU know is the right thing to do. I enjoyed our little book club of two much more than the book itself. The cloud of sadness and regret and fear that was prevalent throughout did not make it a fun read although well written. I will say it was a good choice for 8th graders."
2,What was the name of the Song played...........,The scene where Queen Latifah's character is gunned down - what song was being played? That song was the only reason I bought the soundtrack and it's not on the soundtrack! Does anyone know?
4,can't find songs,"Can anyone tell me where i can download these songs hey joe ,from ya back side , set it off ,live to regret. I've tried on kazaa but it can never find or on winmx.Plz help me out if u can but the movie was off the hook.so holla at ya gurl"
2,The title and the cover are the best things about this book.,"While the arguments are valid, this book drags on and on AND ON AND ON and on. With the exception of How To Program in C++ I had to read in college, this is by far the most boring book I've ever read. Excellent material to keep on the bedside table in case of insomnia, though!"
1,Bad Book?,This was the worst book I have ever read. It was so boring. I have never spent so much money on such a stupid book!! I can't believe that anyone would say that they liked this book!! And I really wouldn't recomend anyone else buying or reading it!!
4,Good Family activity,"I've had this game for a couple of weeks. It's not quite what I expected but it's challenging and fun. The setup and data stuff is a bit tedious, IMHO. Also I don't like all the screen narrative after the game is over, but I don't like it on other WII games either.This is a good family game and will be fun for kidergarteners and up. Within a family setting, even the high schoolers will have fun."
3,Brain,"There is to much ""chattiness"". There should be a way to skip over all of it, especially if you have played it more than once. It gets old, takes too long, and is repetitive. That said, it's a fun game."
5,Good,Its a good game that does test your skills and makes you wanna play against other people to be the best. The challenges never change though so once you got it down you got it down.
5,Great game.. highly recommend.,"Got this game as a birthday gift for my kid and she absolutely loves it. Since it has different levels, it can cater to various skill levels. They have made it interesting to sustain the interest level for the kids."
1,leaky,"All I have to say about this product is that, yes, it does prime the carbon but only when the line is already full of fuel. But the downside is that it leaks and that isn't right. Its a design flaw and not a shipping damage or a faulty production. It also cannot draw fuel into the line."
1,"If your class requires this book, run!!","I took a class called ""Feminist Film Theory"" and this was required reading. I love movies and discussing philosophy and feminism and social movements and all, but if I had known how awful a read this would be I would have dropped the class and saved myself the hassle.I can't complain about the price; it was about half what the campus bookstore was charging and it was in excellent condition. The book itself made me want to tear my hair out. It's a collection of essays by different authors and reading it was like wading through mental quicksand.After one reading assignment my professor (who chose the book!) told us he wouldn't blame us if everyone had come in with a baggie full of ashes that used to be their textbook. So, yeah, I would only recommend this for someone who enjoys convoluted cinematic name dropping. Not a leisure read, and that's coming from someone who read the unabridged Le Miserable for fun."
5,"""The natural thunder""","Amazon, you don't have enough stars that can give this subwoofer the attributes,I feel it requires. You feel you're in the action all the way to the end of the movie after a good action blu-ray movie like ""Air Force One"". I have to turn on the lights to check out the bombs damage to the room and to see how many bullets have hit me. Subwoofers can't get any better than this one. Add more stars! I'll never understand why Monster discontinued this subwoofer. I just finish my home theater with cherry hardwood floors. I went with everything THX right down to the reciever (Onkyo TR-SR707,THX Certified), Monster HD Clean Power, THX inwall speakers and THX certified wires. I went all out ""THX"" wild and I'm so glad I did. I wish you could hear this system, oooOOooo weeee! I'm in heaven. The Monster THX Select Certified Powered Subwoofer (THX SL200-SW) sounds better than GREAT! It sound WONDERFUL!!!!"
1,JUNK,I purchased this item at a game store. I tired the product but found it to be too complicated to use. Also during the start up of the program it allows you one free trail without registrating the product (I use the trail because I did not have access to the internet). After the trail you have to use the internet to registered before the program allows to be utilized. After you go through that ritual you find that the program is JUNK! Due to copyright you can not transfer it to the PSP. I ened up buying the UMD videos. Don't waste your money.
4,Like it,"In my opinion very good product for good price, scores very well, without any issues, like it in all aspects and I would bought it again"
1,Worked for a while....,"I have had this dart board for about 2 years and it's been used about a dozen times. If you looked at my board you would think it had never been used. It was a great dart board, or so I thought. However, the unit stop working, the game selector button stopped working so you cannot start a new game. Since it's off warranty I disassembled the unit and discovered that all the power wires (4) were pinched between the screw mount points and the back of the board. This lead so the wires tugging on the main circuit board as darts were thrown and that has cause the mainboard power tracers to crack and fail. Anyway, long story short, the unit's dead, I can't be bothered to spend the time to fix something that wasn't built correctly the first time. I'm going to find another brand."
4,Nice board,Not very well packed at all. Shipped UPS in original store box.I like the dart board but it is difficult to keep score.
2,good if you're touring the region; otherwise skip,"The director of Los Alamos National Lab is described as an Austrian-American and then his name is consistently given as ""Sid Hecker"". Sixty seconds of searching the web could have confirmed that Sidney is not a very popular name among Austrians and that ""Sig Hecker"" was director of LANL at the time of the book.Sloppy facts rolled into a well-organized and well-told story would be great, but this volume brings to mind a non-fan of Gibbon, upon obtaining a later book! Scribble, scribble, scribble, eh, Gibbon?""Still, there is enough to like and the book is fat enough that I think it might make a good companion while touring the Southwest. I give Shoumatoff for not respecting arbitrary political boundaries. He includes a substantial amount of material about territory that is now part of Mexico."
2,Northern reader,"I just completed the book, and wish I'd read the reviews from readers sooner. The errors definitely distracted from the overall experience. Unlike many of the reviewers, I purchased the book prior to a vacation to Arizona, thinking it might give me an insight into the history and flavour of the American Southwest. That it did - but to see the relationship between Dine/Navajo linked to Athapaskan-speaking people in Canada's north who fished for salmon and built totem poles .. 'Scuse me? The author mixed up the Pacific Northwest's Haida people with the inland Dene. In the chapter named 'Tombstone', the author mistakenly names Val Kilmer as an actor portraying Wyatt Earp; wrong again, Kilmer played Doc Holliday and Kurt Russell played Earp in the movie referred to. And these are just a couple of the more irritating and obvious mistakes.It's too bad, as the material is fascinating. However, I soon began to mistrust the information."
1,Poor product quality. DVD is blank.,Didn't try DVD right away and by the time I did I had misplaced the packing so I couldn't return it.
1,DO NOT BUY FROM THIS SELLER!!!!,THIS GUY SELLS DVD'S THAT WILL NOT WORK IN THE US TO PEOPLE THAT LIVE IN THE US. YOU WILL NOT BE ABLE TO RETURN THE DVD'S SO CONSIDER YOURSELF RIPPED OFF.
2,My cat was terrified of this toy mouse,"I bought this for my adult cat and every time it squeaked she ran and hid. She was truly scared. I gave her a few days and her reaction never got any better. I took it to the animal shelter I volunteer for, and while they weren't scared, no cat was particularly interested. Cats seem to be very particular when it comes to what toys interest them. I am sure some cats love this, but mine did not."
2,Disappointed as well,"I am in complete agreement with the woman who wrote the previuos review. In addition to the disappointing 2 - 3 hours of fountain time, the seal between the bowl and the base of the fountain broke shortly after I purchased it. This product is definitely not worth the money."
2,Terrible movie,Everything explodes. Just a ridiculous way over-done movie that had me rolling my eyes more than anything. The only reason it's worth watching is that it is part of a series. Thank goodness the other Mission Impossible movies have different directors.
4,good movie,Not sure i would pay for this again. It was a good watch though. Lots of action like the other MI 's
4,Good Action Flick,"When you watch an action movie, any action movie, a certain amount of what is called ""belief suspension"" is required. Most action movies have ridiculous, insane and just down-right impossible moments. The car chase between Cruise and Nyha, which a lot of reviewers seem to not get, is her way of making Cruise prove himself worthy of her time and intelligence. The movie gets across exactly what it needs to; a douche wants to make money by hurting people, Cruise has a love interest which could end sourly and states that being a total cock-knuckle will almost surely end in you getting your ass handed to you in a fiery and epic way. Nice wire-work with all the flips, cool driving and a lot of guns. If nothing less it is a good movie for some popcorn, a big screen and killer surround-sound."
3,It's OK,More cookie cutter action . . . more cookie cutter action . . . more cookie cutter action . . . more cookie cutter action . . . more cookie cutter action . . . moe cookie cutter action.
1,BEWARE:If you bought the Enterprise book DON'T BUY THIS ONE!,"Kinnaman has written truly great books that will prepare you for the MCSE exams, but this book IS A VIRTUAL COPY OF THE ENTERPRISE BOOK. Kinnaman tries to cover this up by adding a phrase here and there to sentences, but the book is essentially the same. This begs the question, are the Server and the Server in the Enterprise exams so similar that one can write the same book as a study guide for both? The reason I gave this book one star, even though it may sufficiently prepare you for the Server exam, is that I think either Kinnaman or the publisher (or both) was (were) dishonest in not coming out with a Server/Enterprise combination book, that simply included the few chapters that don't appear in both books into one study guide. He (They) are trying to rip you off.PS: Can someone write another review that lists the chapters that differ between the Server and the Server in the Enterprise books?"
2,Not worth the savings,"I bought this one, and then returned it a month later. The main reason is that the GR-DVM90U is about the same price, and there are two features that are well worth the upgrade to the 90U. The first is the memory card for digital stills. The 80U doesn't have it -- digital stills are stored on the Mini-DV cassette. This is incredibly inconvenient. The second feature is a flash for digital stills. It makes a huge difference, and I have taken some pretty good quality stills with my new 90U. If you already have a digital camera, and don't want to use this camcorder for stills, the 80U is OK. However, if you want to use it for stills, it's well worth it to upgrade to the 90U."
3,Not as Bad as you think,"First novels can be a tough road for writers even as talented as Justin Tussing. I have to admit, I read the review in the NY Times Book Review a few weeks back, and I became intrigued with some of the issues in the book: early 1970's, the idea of three people going off an adventure, the contrast between that era and the one we now live in. There are lots of avenues to pursue. Some of the moments in the writing are worthy of literature, and then other times you scratch your head and wonder what the hype (of this book) is about. Bottom line: I think you have to read it at the right time with just the right mood. That makes it a quirky book, I supppose, and hence the three stars."
1,Don't Waste Your Money....,"After reading the other reviews, I felt compelled to warn the unwary and gullible people who believe them. This was her first novel, obviously, and in my opnion was atrocious. The characters are poorly created, and the only interesting person with any depth is the mother. I like my share of depressing novels, but this one really just bites the dust."
2,"A horrible movie, but great songs!","Yeah well this movie isn't too great, I mean the plot is dumb and ""Olson"" the dolphin talks too much and he has a funny voice. Also they try to mix in ""education"" throughout this movie but the problem with that is that it's wrong! It tries to tell you that dolphins can swim as long as they want underwater but that's not really true. It does give you some ""fascinating"" information about coral, however, plus you get to hear about Moby Dick, and see a giant green octopus known as the Oracle. But the only reason I gave it 2 stars was because the songs in it are SO great! You will find yourself singing ""Mother Sea"" and ""Why Don't they Leave Us Alone"" long after the movie is over! And I must admit, I felt very bad for the beached whale when she said her family was taken away but of course I am a big sap. All in all, if you are landlocked and cannot leave, I would watch this movie to pass the time. Otherwise stay far away."
1,Excellent single. Buy it for 'In Your Memory',"Like the previous reviewer said, 'In Your Memory' can't be found anywhere else, and for me, it was the reason I bought this single. It's a great song, which starts out eerily, and the lyrics keep up the sense of mysteriousness with lines like ""Keep it in your memory/ Leave it in your past/ But don't forget"". Anybody else long for the days back when Depeche Mode's b-sides were just as good (if not better) than the single?"
2,ARGGGGGG,"The dubbing on english just gets worser and worser. And most of all at the ending where Ryu Defeats Bison(Vega in Japan), I won't spoil this but the famous lines of the street fighter moves are screwed up and modified into something stupid. The american version screams and grunts exageretly too much. Stick with original Japanese with english subtitles."
4,Am happy... it is perfect for its price,"The camcorder is small - to fit your palm and to make it difficult to man the controls equally. Close zoom in causes strong shivering in the video. So get closer to get close-up shots.I bought fire-wire ports and installed Studio DV. It works perfectly fine. You can eventually burn VCDs if you have the right CD burner (Roxio 5 and up). The digital quality is not very satisfactory.Overall if you buy the DVM90U it is worth it, for its lower price. Cheers."
2,no support - fire the engineers,"As others have said, there is not only no support for the camera, but some of the features that JVC brags about are almost unusable....for example, the megapixel still images. Can you believe that this feature is not usable on new Macs; only the old out of dated ones.....!? Fire the engineers! I want to throw the camer away to buy a SONY!"
5,Amazing,"It's an amazing cd, in fact all of them are. It's like getting high without taking drugs like good music should be. Highly recommended"
4,This is a great product,Very easy to use and very effective. I use this every day and it has done wonders for my sinus problems. This is a very good deal on refills.
5,My Daughter's favorite doll.,"We have a Boston Terrier that we love, so I bought this plush for my daughter when she was born. She's only 7 months old now, but she has completely decided that this is her favorite doll. It's very soft, durable, and our Boston thinks it's a real dog! I'm really glad we have this plush, because handing it to her is the only way we can keep her from flipping off of the changing table. The toy is quite well made, and looks very realistic. It even has that forward stance that Boston Terriers are known for. Great doll."
5,GPS waypoints for the pacfic NW,"Bob Hale cruises the Northwest every summer. Here are the GPS waypoints he uses. I have all 3 of his waypoint guides. Bob is extremely conscientious with his waypoints. These are very precise lat/lons. I use them religously. They're invaluable for our fishing and traveling. Well worth the price.Wayne Heinz, author of, How to Catch Salmon, Sturgeon, Lingcod, Rockfish, and Halibut Along the Pacific Coast: Fish On!"
1,try another provider AND another brand,"This looks like a price ripoff from the previous review (plus shipping!).For a 250v 5amp fuse try cooper bussman fuses from Amazon. Superb fuses. Low low prices. (Make sure the fuse has the right 'blowing"" profie---i.e. fast, slow, etc.)"
3,pretty good,"I enjoyed this video but I thought the instruction segment could have been longer. It's only 20 minutes of instruction....I think they should have made it 30-40 minutes long so that it feels like a full workout, and not just a sampling of a few techniques."
5,Excellent writing by a Latina but a book for all audiences,"This was one of those books that I just could not put down.Being a latino it brought back many memories of my mother,a devoted Catholic,and her Saints.When my mother died I kept her Saints and packed them in a box when we moved to our new house.what an excellent job by Ms. Escandon in describing the main character,Esperanza.Not to keen in the ways of the world but certainly not lacking in common sense and wholeheartedly devoted to her only child. This was a refreshing and authentic book unlike so many of the books today that all seem to come from the same brain factory.It should appeal to all audiences."
5,insightful pleasure reading,"I read this book after having read Maria Escandon's book ""Gonzalez & Daughter"". It was a great read and different from any other book I have read which was refreshing. Although it gave an insight into another world (prostitution), the author still portrayed the lead character as sympathetic and likable. It was funny at times; disturbing at times and heartfelt at times. The relationship the main character had with the saints and her faith gave it a totally different dimension. I enjoyed it and highly recommend it."
3,This is a good book.,"This is a very useful book to study and teach.It describes well the actual use of grammatical features in different varieties of English :mainly conversation , fiction , newspaper , language , and academic prose."
2,Not recommended: just statistical/frequency data,"If you are a teacher, student or a writer seeking guidance, this is not the book which I would suggest, as it's really not prescriptive at all. It's chock full of frequency data wrt various grammatical constructs. It's like reading the census data, if you know what I mean. You'll be left out in netherspace, to basically extract the rules by yourself. Would much rather suggest using your hard earned dollar to buy the ""Comprehensive Grammar ..."" by Quirk to get some real guidelines. However, if you like statistics, buy this book, you'll love it ..."
1,How to be white and use political influence to get what you want,Santorums 15 minutes are about up and he is now backpedaling from Bush and all his nutty ideas as fast as he can. He's about to lose an election. Read this book to see why.
2,You will like this book if you already agree with him.,"This book does not seem to have a target audience. You will like this book if you already agree with Rick Santorum. However, if you already agree with him, his book is not really accomplishing anything. If you are moderate, you will probably be too put off by some of his statements to be able to sift through the book and find the reasonable ideas. If you are liberal, you will probably throw the book across the room. Santorum basically insults and demeans people who do not agree with him, so if you are going into this book trying to get the other perspective, you will probably just be insulted."
1,Worst Clegg Book Ever,I read 40% of this and submitted the book for a refund. This is one of the worst cases of all telling no showing I have ever read from a professional author. Clegg has always been hit or miss with me. The Hour Before Dark and Neverland are outstanding horror novels. This one is a total miss. Avoid.
2,Boring!,Man! this book was so boring. Its about a kid that plays on a baseball team and cant throw to 2nd base well at all. In this book it took the writer of this book like 3 chapters to tell the story of one game. There was no action what so ever in this book. the whole book led up to one play where the catcher me a great tag out. But i still gave this book 2 starts instead of 1 because there were some parts where it almost got interesting for a second.
4,My second favorite Ween album,"Go buy this album! It isn't their best, White Pepper gets that nod, but it sure is close. My only complaint is that they seem to not be able to handle success. They put together a couple of truly awesome songs and it freaks them out so they jam in some nearly unlistenable track that just grates the nerves. They cleaned it up on White Pepper and then really regressed with Quebec (half of that album could be deleted). Awesome prog-rock album that should have just been a concept album, ala Pink Floyd or Alan Parsons Project."
5,a tip o' me hat to sum seafarin' songs,"AYE this here platter o' goodness brings me back to days of olde..LISTEN this is one of the coolest albums EVER, just buy it now ya landlubber! If any modern music can come close to the genius of say, the Beatles or Zappa, then WEEN is it. The Mollusk is my first ween cd, It is pure creativity and imagination set to music. With the sea farin' theme it conjures up all kinds of moods with tons of variation and strange oddities. ""the golden eel"" is a Bowie meets pink floyd on a tuna boat epic theme, one of my favorites. OH MY GOD STOP READING AND CLICK TO BUY THIS LOVELY HEAP O"" TENDERNESS!!!!"
3,Changing minds is (usually) a slow process,"I like Howard Gardner's step by step explicatory writing. I respect the crucial role he played in breaking open the complexities of intelligence, and I like the way he continues to apply his theories in contexts different from their origin. I thought him disingenuous in his foreword?preface? when he said he hadn't anticipated the interest shown...within political and advertising circles...but whatever reason you have for selecting this book, I think you will find much to reflect on for application to your own particular circumstance. I have not read other works in this field and selected it because of the author, whose absence of breathless zeal I particularly appreciate. I found it relevant to my work in education, my life in a new, small, community, and even to my grappling with the personal dimensions of more healthy living."
2,Changing minds with one point of view,"I found the first 50 pages or so to be intriguing, after that it became a grind to endure. Mr. Gardner makes very indirect references to the impact of the media on the vignettes that he recounts, yet seemingly asserts that the individuals involved acted in a vacuum.The author credits Bill Clinton with single handedly coming up with ""mend it, don't end it"" for welfare, yet does not explain how the Republican congress of 94 had any part in this course of action.Darwin is treated as an infallible truth, yet Mr. Gardner does not address the lack of transitional forms, the various ""truths"" that are allowed to exist, like the stages of the human embryo [fish, primate with tail] and the lack of any new species.The author does have some interesting ideas, yet the simplistic characterization of the people or ideas that he analyzes [see the part on George Bush] fails to allow us, the readers, to form a realistic idea of the forces acting on them.So how do I change minds?"
2,Poor product,"I've been using sponge cloths for many years, and the last time I went to buy them, they were no longer available in any store where I'd found them before. So I went on line, and found these, thinking that a sponge cloth is a sponge cloth. Well I was wrong -- these are much smaller, thinner, and less absorbent than the ones I'd always had before, and very disappointing. I bought ten of them, and now regret it."
5,I give them their props too......,"Hey, i like what the doors did with fusing jazz, and blues into rock n roll it works well, and i have to say its cool.Im a black teenager and i like this greatest hits collection.I didnt know who the doors are into i was on the school bus, and my friend showed me her cd collection. I asked her to make a copy for me and she did. Now i listen to it sometimesMy fav songs are:People are strange- oh yeah i can relate to thatlight my fire"
1,Falls Short of its Goal in Every Way a Book Can,"""Compelling evidence?"" False advertising if I've ever seen it.The only people such ""evidence"" would manage to sway are people who already believe. That's a fairly poor scientific standard. I have spent my whole life WANTING to believe, and my intellect not letting me - I came to this book WANTING to find something compelling - and it fell so far short.The writing wasn't even compelling - until the end, when the author is re-counting someone ELSE'S narrative.Poor, poor, poor, in every sense, and didn't get into the specifics of Dr. Stevenson's methodology, which would be the place to start if you wanted anyone to believe in the solidity of the research."
3,The individual cases discussed are not worth a book.,"I have read a fair sampling of books about reincarnation, so I suppose I had high expectations when I purchased this book. I have no argument with the author's interpretations/opinions re: past research, and what it all may mean, etc. My disappointment stems from the fact that the cases he discusses are simply rather boring examples of the phenomena. Although he was limited to those cases which he could not hand pick that were under investigation during the trips to Lebanon and India, he could have at least included some reference, anecdotal or not, to some more compelling cases that would make the book more worthwhile reading. It was a letdown."
2,Runs but never fisinshes the race.,"This book is a compilation of the author's thoughts. It is like he is thinking out loud. It tells a lot about everything but never ties it into the ""final"" thought or ending of the author's exploration. Leaves you knowing as much as before you read it."
2,A dissapointing evaluation of the evidence,"The author learned of the research of Ian Stevenson, M.D. and decided to accompany him to evaluate the subjects first hand. The book spends more time describing the details of the trips and the surroundings the author found himself in than on describing the subjects themselves. In support of the evidence of reincarnation the author concludes that the subjects are truthful and the evidence cannot be explained by any other explanation than reincarnation, but it is much more interesting to read the evidence in the several books that Ian Stevenson has written about his case studies."
5,Fascinating and delightfully agenda-free,"Tom Shroder has done us all a great service with ""Old Souls."" He is an evocative writer who, in my view, hits just the right note, neither blindly accepting nor summarily dismissing the remarkable -- but, often, aggravatingly flawed -- cases that he and Prof. Stevenson encounter. And unlike another reviewer here, I enjoyed the 'travelogue' aspects of the book nearly as much as the exploration of reincarnation -- if Schroder wants to write a straight travel book next time, sign me up!"
3,Disapointed,To much detail of the authors travels. I thought it was going to be just cases. The cases were sprinkeld in only.
2,"Gritty product, poor service","I purchased this product from a local store during my first pregnancy and loved it. It went on silky smooth, smelled good, stopped the itching. Sadly the local store no longer carries it, so I bought it from BeautyCost.I bought two, opened the first and it felt like they'd poured sand into the mix. The second was okay--not great. I called BeautyCost and they said that I couldn't return it since I'd opened it. (How was I to know that the product was defective or old without opening it??) Then the person on the line said, oh yeah, because of the natural ingredients, that product gets gritty. Yeah... Not buying the product again, not buying anything from them again."
1,Not based in Reality,"I think they are better ways to raise your children with respect than to not give them any consequences for their actions. If my children are fighting, I am too go and hug both of them and tell them how much I love them both and it stops? The culture we live in promises there will be consequences for actions, good or bad. I'd like my children to grow up with a sense of respect as well as a sense of realism regarding life. If they flunk out of college no one is going to pat them on the head and explain the benefits of a decent education. I thought this book was ridiculous and I wondered if the authors even have children."
3,Good CD,"I bought this CD or the song ""If Tomorrow Never Comes"". It is a very sentimental love song. The rest of the CD is ok."
2,Not quite sure...,"I didn't really like this book. Part of the reason is because I've read 4 of K'wan's later work and REALLY liked them. This was his second book and you can tell. It started off too slow and took too long to get to the action. When the action did start, however, it was good. You have to wait until the end of the book and that is why I didn't it.I was wondering what his earlier work was like... and now I know. I won't be reading his 1st book but I will be reading what he puts out next. If anything, this shows how much an author can grow over time. It says this book was put out in 2003. You think they would have fixed all the typos and mis-spelled words in FOUR years!!!I'm not a teacher or anything but the mistakes were glaring and embarassing. Also, when I'm really pushing to get my customers to read stories by Black authors this doesn't help at all. The first printing... maybe. 4 years down the line is just plain stupid!!!"
1,boring,"I guess I am not a fan of K'wan books. I read this book, but I skimed through it. It's like he is too detailed, jus get to the point."
3,Disappointing,Not the best recording that you would expect from these three great artists. Save your money and buy something more recent.
3,"Decent , but could have been betta","Not great, but enjoyable in it's own way. Likeable cast. Needs a more sure-handed director...and a more fleshed out script. The story framework was there, and a decent crew of characters...but not executed to it's full potential."
2,Why watch it? Firth and Kingsley and no other reason at all,"Colin Firth and Ben Kingsley could read a dictionary and keep me entertained but their being cast in this dreadful movie cut it really close. The movie is and will always remain a dreadful waste of the $2.99 I spent renting it.Dull because of possibly one of the worst scripts I have ever been witness to. Honestly, this is a dreadful movie that must have paid some of the very popular cast members quite a bit for them to appear in a movie based on the really horrid script. Perhaps they all got together and tied one on and signed a contract to appear in this mess while inebriated.......I dont know.Incredibly poor movie. While watching it I experience my first desire to kill a young male actor in my entire life. Perhaps the kid will get into something more suitable for him, like child prostitution.This really was and always will be a purely dreadful movie."
2,It's worth seeing once for curiosity,The fighting scenes are OK. The acting is below par. The plot is not interesting. It's worth seeing once for curiosity
4,Last Legion last great stand,I enjoyed this movie from the start to the end. The cast was great Colin Firth and Ben Kingsley brought their charactors to life. The battle scenes were great. This is a movie that I recommend to those who like a wonderful adventure and great people that you will enjoy to watch.
5,Excelente Libro,"Creo que he contado con suerte al seleccionar este libro como mi primer libro sobre conducción deportiva. Existen muchos libros que tratan el tema pero me dejé llevar por el buen nombre que tiene la Skip Barber Racing School y creo que hice muy bien. El libro cubre, creo yo, todo lo que en teoría se debería saber a cerca de como correr en un auto de carreras, después del libro sólo queda poner en práctica todas las cosas que se aprendieron, algo que obviamente es muy complicado, pero por lo menos al haber leido el libro ya te sientes con confianza de que no estás actuando como un ser irracional al frente del volante de un auto de carreras. Yo aconsejo que lo compren y además si tienen la opción de hacer el curso (yo no la tengo) lo hagan, creo que es uno de los más completos que hay en el mundo, lo digo porque he investigado el asunto por largo tiempo."
3,Not Worth it.,"just bought it from circuit city. sound ok, not that great.However it does work how it supposed to, though it only comes with a small sheet of paper, NO user guide, which they mentioned that they would have one in the package. just my first time listening the letters and everything got all jumbled up, and it was question marks, and all types of punctiation marks on the screen, the LCD display isnt too good, not as bright as i expected, you can barely see it even in the dark, and to turn it off HOLD the stop button, which the sheet of paper says just press it twice... Over all this is not too good of a product for that price, i wouldn't suggest buying, However if you do decide to buy it, make sure you buy it at the store, dont order it."
2,bla....,"A decent design, but the oval display window cuts off some part of the outter characters. The volume on this thing is HORRIBLE. At the maximum of 40, you barely get just enough volume for a quiet room. Again, signature of Sonicblue, the claimed 15 hrs of battery life is NOT attainable with normal use. Build quality is actually decent, but the joystick key is really [bad]. The down arrow key doesn't work very well, i have to press it soo hard to activate, so hard that i am afraid i might punch through the circuit board underneath it. I think sonicblue's sp100 unit is the only one I like... everything else is just downhill from there..."
1,Dont drop it!!,"This is the most fragile CD player I have ever seen. I went through !4! of these CD players and each of them broke when I dropped them once or twice. These werent big drops, 3 feet max. It has reading problems where for no reason it would say ""read error"" (this happens even before you ""break"" it). It was great having 180 songs on one CD, but replacing it so often is not worth it. I reccomend the sony line of CD players (they have a mp-cd player too), that line can really take a beating."
1,Lacks Reliability,"I dropped it once, less than a foot from the ground and it stopped working. Warranty does not cover that. It looks nice and runs great, but it can't take any abuse without completly breaking down. I suggest trying something else."
4,subtle and sophisticated,"What the artist achieves on most of the tracks is a composition that is far greater than the sum of the parts. Superpitcher knows how to sculpt sound to his needs, and creates subtle, sexy, sophisticated passages of music to house his whispered vocals. If you don't dig male vocals in your techno, you may want to look elsewhere. I emphasize that overall I'm impressed with his singing, and find it fits snuggly into his toe-tapping, feverishly bouncy house production. It is perhaps best to think of the vocals as an essential ingredient in the song's sound-texture, rather than the song's focal point as in a rock group."
5,kids of all ages love this one,I took it to a dinner for adults and there were 2 girls 9yrs and 12 yrs old. They had a good time thanks to this book. Quick little jokes kids love to ask grown ups.
2,No illustrations,"The jokes range from blah to very funny. There are NO illustrations. Beyond the cover, the book is colorless and appears very boring."
4,Puts it all in one (rather long) place,"The real purpose of this book is the fold-out time-line. It is beautiful and about 5 feet long (8 pages). It makes good use of color and symbols. It compares Biblical events with other world events to help give it a better context. The chart can be easily removed without damage, but you may need to re-staple the book (or throw it away). The chart is printed on only one side of coated glossy paper so there is no image bleed-through.The chart begins with Abraham and concludes with the death of the Apostle John.Very useful for the classroom or for home study.The text is, well, condensed. The authors managed to squeeze the entire history of the Israel and the Apostles into 16 pages, including the index."
1,Richard Groove Holmes Flop,"In my view the CD, Dancing in the Sun, was a disappointingflop. There was too much interference or override fromother instrumentation in this production and not enoughof pure swinging Groove Holmes. There were too manyrepetitions from accompanyists and the overall effectborderlined on kietch. Holmes comes across betterin trio and quartet format."
3,STM,Good background stories for the fan of STTOS but for the novice this would be mostly boring stuff about the production teams and the writers. Bill Shatner has a good sense of humor and keeps the listener engaged with some highlights.
2,Not for me,"I thought I would try this product because I love the scent of the lavender vanilla body wash I use on my son at bath time. I was disappointed in this product because the vanilla scent seems to be the predominant one, creating a sickly sweet smell on my skin, which ends up giving me a headache."
2,Clamps fell apart on two of these lamp fixtures-poor quality,"I bought two of these fixtures less than one month ago and both the clamps fell apart, causing the very expensive bulbs to fall into the lizard enclosure, damaging the bulbs and stressing our reptile.I do not recommend these fixtures.The ceramic portion seems fine but the clamps are cheap metal and do now work well."
3,Workable but not without some serious flaws,Review is for the PNY Vibe 1GB White.Sound quality is average; nothing spectacular.Bootup takes quite a while compared to other flash players (10-13 secs).Transfer is also slow since it's only USB1.1.Device will not save files over 15-16MB so those who wants to listen to long audio files or save huge files are SOL; disappointing given the storage size of this thing.No other performance problems otherwise.
5,Excellent!,This is an excellent book for parents to read to their 5-7 year olds. It explains in an imaginative way how the tooth fairy can look just like a parent. I'm a first grade teacher and it is the book I pull off the shelf when the first child in my class loses a tooth. The story keeps the children on the edge of their seats and does not disappoint in the end!
5,Required reading for dixhuitiemistes,"Starr's brilliant elucidation of the generic interplay between poetry and prose during the eighteenth century will be welcomed by students of what used to be called the ""rise of the novel."" Also insightful for scholars of Romantic poetry, as Starr focuses on the way these poets came to use ""representational practices pioneered in the novel to bridge the gap between one person's lived experience and that of another."" (198)"
2,Get it from the Library,"I purchased the Kindle edition (~$10) after listening to an interview with John McPhee on NPR - having not read any McPhee books previously. Notwithstanding glowing reviews by others, I was disappointed overall. I found the book dated, meandering and rather short (the latter points likely reflecting its origins as a magazine article). I read it on a long-haul flight and to be honest it seemed like a long version of one of those ""color"" articles one finds in airline magazines. I have purchased on the order of 40 Kindle books to date and this is the first time I have felt short-changed. I would say you could spend $10 (and your time) more productively than on this book. (Sept 2011)"
1,Ugh! What is this?,"This is NOT at all what I thought it was going to be. It is just some lady trying to sing like Tori, although I cannot seem to see the similarity. Don't quit your day job... On the inside of the cover it shows the same girl has done several ""tribute"" albums for different artists, including Natalie Merchant. I do not reccomend this for a tori fan. Save yourself the money and buy the real stuff..."
1,karoke,A tribute album is not good simply because the artist tries hard. The covers on this album are little more than karoke. Karoke doesn't make for a tribute album.
1,tribute?,"Tribute? I might as well sing a long in my car, record it, and call it a tribute. Thats how I feel about this albums originality. The music and her voice sound like a cheap imitation. She should have made it her own, added her own twist it's too much of the same music vocal style. I've heard better covers of cornflakegirl by jawbox, and iieee and professionalwidow by the pimps, these bands made it their own."
1,"Not a tribute, just a poor imitation.","Sad. This album should've been titled, ""Should've Kept Silent All These Years--Sessions From A Bad Karaoke Bar"" because that's exactly what it sounds like. Sure, we all sing Tori in the shower, in the car, wherever, but at least the rest of us have the common sense not to put it on a record! Toriphiles--this is your alert to steer clear! Stick to the real thing--you'll be much better off."
2,Disappointing...,"As a huge Tori fan I was intrigued to find a tribute cd by various artists. Imagine my surprise to find the ""various artists"" was a 23 year old unknown English woman whose previous claim to fame was a tribute cd to Kate Bush! She has a good voice but, naturally, can't compare to Tori. Basically this is a cd of Tori covers. I wouldn't mind so much but they sound exactly the same as the originals. Nothing added, no re-interpritations. I keep thinking of Tori's cover of ""Smells Like Teen Spirit"" and can't help thinking this tribute could have been better. I guess there is some novelty in owning it but it isn't a must-have."
1,Gwen Stiffani is a Tori fan?,"It truly sounds like NO DOUBT decided to cover Tori...and no, they can't pull it off. When you get the opportunity to record your own album, you should do just that. The whole idea of an unknown somebody making an entire cd of Tori's songs (not changing them in the slightest) sort of bugs me, and probably frightens Tori. I close by saying...STAY AWAY unless you feel like laughing, of course."
4,Belkin Travel Charger,"I have found this to be the best priced and most flexible charger as it enables charge through USB, AC and car adapter."
1,Not really for sports,"I purchased this MP3 player for use on my long runs. Although I liked the size and sound quality, the limitations of this device quickly became apparent.1. It is not really designed for sports. It is not moisture proof. I am not looking to immerse the device in water, it should have been at least sweatproof.2. The device's software is not 100% stable. The software crashed on me. No hardware reset, the solution? software reset (reload firmware) - only available on the PC, not Macintosh. On the Macintosh, you can upgrade the firmware, but not reset the firmware.3. Not durable. After two weeks of use and without dropping it, one of the buttons became stuck in the pressed position. I tried to fix it, but ended up breaking the unit. So, the only time that I did drop it was in the trash.I am going to purchase a good sports FM radio and wait a year or so until a REAL sports flash MP3 hits the market."
2,My Rio S30S Review,"Had this Mp3 player two weeks and the volume up botton stopped working, I took the player apart and resoldered the micro switchand that solved the problem.As I'm electronic technician this wasen't much of a problem for me but to all others consideringthis product beware the construction of this thing is hardlyrugged. On the plus side it has great sound and the battery life is pretty good, it also supports low bitrate files which is why I bought it.Hope my little review helps with your buying decision."
1,piece of junk,"i bot this player about a year agoand guess what its already making buzzing soundsi e-mailed their customer service , and they tell meto get new headphones. I GOT NEW HEADPHONESIT STILL BUZZING.the radio feature never worked right."
2,Try again Rio.,"This player sounds like a great deal: expandable, radio included, perfect for the gym. BUT once you get it out of the box the honeymoon is over. The buttons aren't as solid feeling as they should be. The menu isn't that great, and like many have said before the radio is a joke unless you live very close to the towers. Sound quality is ok, but the real nightmare began when I connected it to my computer (win98). I installed the driver, and the Rio music management software. But once I connected the player, it flipped from recognizing the device, to not recognizing it every 5 seconds. The help line, which is a long distance number-on hold for 40 minutes-ended up telling me that my computer was the problem. Long story short, I returned it the next day and got the Nike psa 64. It works perfectly. Guess it's not my computer."
4,Great service,"I was very happy with the service and the book, the delivery was fast and the book was in good condition, and the fees for both very resonable."
1,Birthday gift gone bad!,"I purchased this item as a birthday gift for my son. When the gift was opened, to our surprise there was NO music CD in the box. Basically, my son received an empty box for his birthday. I contacted Amazon.com and expressed my dissatisfaction. I will not buy from this company again, and certainly will not recommend the company to any friends!"
4,Classic text remains (mostly) valid,"The Bushido as a guide for the warrior is still a text with plenty of inspiration, and this is quite a handsome edition of it. It is not surprising that big companies still use it for leadership seminars. Parts of it sound prety predatory to the modern ear, and parts (see the section on homosexuality) are far from politically correct. The sections on remaining focused and goal directed while adhering to fundamental values hold their water."
4,Exceptional Film,"The life of Edith Piaf unfolds from the depths of poverty to ove of the most beloved and famous singers the world hs ever known. The film does so with superb production values, wonderful performances and especially the fearless and spot on portryal by Marion Cotilard as Edith.She owns the film - and the performance is nothing short of spectacular."
1,BUYER BEWARE,"This web page states the DVD has English subtitles. I received my copy and it does not have subtitles, English or any other. The DVD is very good and will be a good purchase if you speak French. I tried it on three different DVD players and they all agree, no subtitles."
5,Brilliant music,"Ok, so film is in French. The acting and the music is brilliant. Tells the story of Edith Piaf so well. I thought the acting was bang on and the music is fantastic. This is one time you need to get over fear of reading sub titles and just sit back and enjoy a lovely time watch a film that will move you."
4,"""Whose Child Is She?"" ~ The Heart And Soul Of France","Note: French with English subtitles.The '07 release `La Vie En Rose' provides the viewer with a fascinating, though jumbled journey through the tumultuous life of the legendary French singler/icon, Edith Piaf. Piaf lived a hard life and nothing is held back or glossed over in this cinematic depiction. She was temperamental, at times cruel and lived a life of indulgence and excess. However she also was a woman of infinite passion and drive and those characteristics made Edith a survivor and aided in her rise above her faults and miseries become the most beloved French icon of the 20th century.Marion Cotillard is wonderful in the starring role, the production values are superior and the music bittersweet and nostalgic. How could that voice not evoke one's deepest emotions?"
5,La Vie en Rose,"This is a well made, truly excellent rendition of Edith Piaf's life. It tells the story of her life though a series of flashbacks. It takes us from her humble birth, though the difficult years of her childhood and teen years. This movie helps us better understand the kind of events that helped shape her personality as well as her complexes. Throughout the film we hear her beautiful music which reflects her deep desire to be loved and her unwavering sense of hope. One comes away from the film with sadness for the difficulties she endured thoughout her life but with a great respect for her ability to rise above her problems and create beautiful music."
3,The darker side of Edith Piaf,"The film is a moving portrayal of Edith Piaf's life, but at time difficult to follow. Overall it portrayed the tragedy far better than the triumph. I may be a sentimentalist, but My memory of her greatness seems like a morfitting take away than som much bitter taste.I am writing a theater production about edith Piaf's life and I hope to capture more of the power and beauty, while remaining true to her difficult life's story."
1,Foam pads fell apart right out of package,I don't know how these sound... I opened the package and took the two foam covers out.. they literally fell apart in my hand. The earbuds won't stay put without them.... so right now I'm writing this review and listening to my MP3 player through my SKULLCANDY earbuds... still my best investment...
2,"ok gps, mapsend software incompatible.","The GPS works fine, but I bought this unit because of the software available that it was supposedly compatible with. Do NOT purchase this unit if you think it will work with any of the mapsend programs. It will NOT work. I have spent 3 days of sending emails and making phone calls, and cannot get any support from this company whatsoever. I still have yet to load topo map one into this gps. With no releif in site. I have resigned myself to the fact that I am going to have to send it back. As for the technical support from Magellan... I would rate it a negative 5 on a scale from one to ten. The very worst I've ever experienced."
2,Nice GPS really bad software,"I bought this thing and tried it, it's a really nice GPS for the price, a bit frail it seemed, otherwise OK.Good reception outside and in the car, no signal indoors however. My main beef with it: I installed the software on my computer and it kept giving me a warning that it is highly recommended I should not install this software because it could do permanent damage to my computer. I installed it anyway. It would not work, it would not recognize the GPS, it would not connect...after one evening of failed attempts I decided to return it. I really needed it to connect to my PC because I wanted to add topographic maps, I'm really glad I did not buy the topo software with it. If you just want a GPS with the base map and you're not planning to add maps this one will do."
3,Ok but I think Garmin's better,"I had bought my father a Garmin eTrex entry level GPS and wanted one for myself.I tried the eXplorist to compare them and see which one was better.Even though the differences are slim, I think if I had to buy a new one now, I'd go for Garmin's GPS.My main issue of concern has been the (apparently so far to me) impossibility of clearing the main trip and the fact that it seems to be impossible to measure speed in the different sections of my trips (NOTE: I use my GPS to keep track of my performance when I'm climbing volcanoes - this is a very particular application). I know for a fact that Garmin's eTrex does not have a problem with these issues.So, at least from my perspective, even though I'm not disappointed with the product, I suggest you try Garmin.Good luck!"
1,CHRISTMAS NIGHTMARE,"I bought this item for my son, a third year electrical engineer student at the U of A. My brother, who has owned 3 GPS systems, tried for 3 days to use this product. It would not perform any of the operations they tried. It would not even turn off. They used every available source of help to get this product off and running. It was such a dissappointment to our family. I would not recommend anyone buy this item."
2,darnit,Ok so when I bought this here on amazon I was in a hurry ..I thought this was a talking unit and its not. It would be good for a truckdriver etc but not for my needs. I need a voiceunit not just a small display
4,Great Mp3,"This mp3 is very great.The Bad things about it are 1.)It doesnt have good earphones, 2.) The belt case isn't that great(it doesn't fit the mp3's top buttons. The good things are 1.) That it is upgradeble to 640 MB. 2.) It runs on one AAA battery!!!(who wouldn't like that?) 3.) The software is very easy to use (if you have roxio it is way easier to download songs from your own cd's). All and all this is a great mp3"
2,False Advertizing,"Although it makes as a great mp3 player, it is not as rugged as they say it is. My dad and I bought one each but both broke. Mine was moderately hit and completely broke. My dad's started coming open and and the volume wouldn't go down. It makes as a great mp3 player but just doesn't stand up rugged of a teenager."
1,"Faulty product, Extremely bad customer service.","I purchased a Rio S35S through the RioBlue website last spring.My first one lasted for 2 months before its ""system"" crashed and the customer service representative (after making me run though several month long hoops) finally said it was unfixable and replaceable. She had a new one shipped out to me after I sent in their faulty product at my own expense.Their customer service correspondance was largely ineffectual and very time-consuming. The entire process took me about half a year to complete, so you can imagine I was quite dismayed when the REPLACEMENT PLAYER I received ALSO CRASHED in the same manner, not two weeks after I received it.This was my worse internet shopping experience to date, and I warn you against dealing with this company and its products."
3,Not bad ...,"The player itself is very good, ie, good sound, small size, upgradeable with MMC or SD cards, handy ... But there is something that really bothers me, it doesn't have a hold button! Whenever you put it in your pocket, in your hand or anywhere else you will easily (and accidentally) press the big round set that has the Play and so on. It's very frustrating to put it in your pocket and press the buttons with any minimal movement ..."
1,SONIC blue Rio S35S - Disappointment,"I purchased this item on reviews, looks and I thought quality...that is not the case. I can not get the software to work on my new Gateway computer with home-Windows XP, I called Sonic Blue who manufactures this product and they were NO help. I would not recommend this product to no one!"
4,Excellent MP3 player,"Excellent MP3 player, does exerything your could want, and easy to use.Why not a 5 rating??1. Radio reception is poor2. Headphones are poor.Still more that worth it. Excellent for athletes."
5,A must before you use the player,"I just received this player as a christmas gift. I found the sound is amazingly well for this small size gadget. It also has an equalizer to change the music settings.I strongly recommend you to visit www.digitalnetworksna.com/support/rio/ to upgrade the player firmware and the RIO Music Manager.After the firmware upgrade, it will let you upgrade up to 1G of memory (SD or MMC memory card). I believe 512M is a basic necessity. It also let me play by my own playlist rather than all the songs I have in my player. I find this very useful, because I can organize the songs by album.I love the sound quality and the small size. It is a good quality product."
1,Beyond bad,"This movie is beyond bad: the concept is completely unoriginal, the script vapid and ridiculous, and the acting 100% unbelievable. Unless you're a student in your first video-arts class looking for examples of what not to do for your first project, don't waste your time on this movie."
4,Mouse Tales (I Can Read Book 2),"MY 5 YEAR OLD GRANDSON LOVED READING THIS COLLECTION OF SHORT STORIES ON MY KINDLE. HE IS LEARNING TO READ RIGHT NOW AND HE WAS ABLE TO HANDLE ALMOST ALL OF THE WORDS IN THESE STORIES. HE LAUGHED AT THE STORIES AND COULDN'T WAIT TO SHARE THE STORIES WITH HIS MOM AND DAD. IT WAS NICE TO SEE HIM READING ON THE KINDLE INSTEAD OF PLAYING VIDEO GAMES FOR A CHANGE. CUTE BOOK.....GLAD IT WAS AVAILABLE ON THE KINDLE. WE ALSO LOVE ""OWL AT HOME"" BY THE SAME AUTHOR."
2,Uh...say what?,"I mentor elementary school children who have problems reading. We read this book out loud together - one of the short stories was about an old mouse who went for a walk every day but hated children. While he was walking, his suspenders broke and his pants fell down. He cried for help but ladies screamed and ran away. Even his own wife said he looked silly in his underwear and hit him on the head. But the children he hated helped him pull up his pants and held them up with chewing gum. From then on, he was nice to children. What? I found that a little inappropriate. I know through a kid's eyes, it's just a story, but I told her that if you are capable of walking everyday, you are capable of pulling up your own pants. Kids shouldn't help adults pull up their pants."
1,don't be misled! A long book about four bitter women...,"I will never again recommend a book by Penelope Stokes to a friend. I had such a bad taste in my mouth after I read this book. I read to the end, hoping that at some point it would end up encouraging. If you don't mind books that graphically describe lesbian relationships, use foul language, are entirely cynical, and focus on people who remain bitter throughout their lives then you won't mind this book and may even enjoy it. I am so puzzled by the reviews. But, I think the reviewers approached this book as adult fiction. Unfortunately, my library placed it in the inspirational section--which it is not. Don't be misled thinking that this book will be anything like the Blue Bottle Club. Please find another--a better book to read!"
2,Disappointing Book-Delta Belles,"These women all have major problems with their relationships and sink into the inability to solve them. Their reunion helps for the better; however, some of the topics they reveal about themselves is not at all familiar to me."
3,"demented??,disfigured??,defomed??? what does ""D"" stand for??","i love different styles of music and this sounded like a decent techno,jungle drill & bass album. Some of the songs are loud and crazy but this is aphex's unique sound. my favourite song is of course the ""girl boy song"" which sounds like a good soundtrack for a racing playstation game.The fact is most of aphex twin's fans will be turned off from buying this cd due to the disturbing freaky cd cover!, my goodness it looks totaly insane!!, he dares anyone to buy his album and review his music.this is probably the best cd to buy if you want to scare people."
4,Almost perfect.,"There are two annoying parts of this DVD. The first one, is the cencorship. They should not have beeped out the curse words on the songs (I'm glad I still have my ""skills"" video). This is so annoying, that I almost want to return the DVD.Second, is that there is nothing from Licsensc to Ill on it. That's more understandable, because maybe they didn't want to pay the kickback to Def Jam. Still, that hardly makes it a complete anthology.These points aside...it is still a great DVD for any BBoy fan."
2,Sent mine back,The recharge feature over USB is a great idea but mine didn't work. The sound quality was really good but it got progressivly worse as the unit ran. After three songs it was fuzzy and unbearable. At nearly 200 bills I expect better and will probably get better sound from a cheaper unit. Tech support was unresponsive and only sent me a form email stating that I should try playing the MP3 file again.
2,Great until it stopped working,"I loved this mp3 player -- until it stopped working altogether after three months of use. I purchased it at Best Buy and had their replacement plan, so thankfully I got all of my money back. It was a great player while it was functioning, but clearly I won't be buying this one again."
4,The best inexpensive Mp3 Player 2002!,"It is small cute and quite adorable. Backlit blue screen, it comes in colors! FM tuner works (depending where you live!) and your headphones have a long cord, like mine. Mp3 uploading is quick, but the headphones ...., just buy some digital ones (sony has one for mp3 players).... How cool is that!You just have to edit your play list when your taste changes for all the non ipod people out there."
1,Worst MP3 Player!,This product I had for about 3 months and the unit kept restarting any time you pushed a button. I received my second one and out of the box it was doing the exact same thing. When I got my THIRD one it was freezing with my memory card in it and anytime it was out it worked fine. I sent the memory back and got a new one and tried it and it was doing the exact same thing with the old one. So right now I am contacting Sonic Blue to get my FORTH replacement. The only pros I can say is that it is a good player when it plays correctly and they have good tech support.
3,Everyday user. Pros and Cons. Hard to organize.,"Got it about a month ago. Added a 256MB memory card. A cheaper choice for Mac. I use it everyday, including while working out...fairly satisfied.Pros1.Battery life2.Light weight.3.Easy to use.4.Works with Mac (better price than iPod) and PC5.Expandable6. Very good audio quality.Cons1.iTunes always crash when I try to add a big group of songs. It also takes a while when you want to erase a song.2.Every time I add a song the entire list is updated. And the process is slow.3. I though that I would be able to search my playlist (rock, hip hop, classic, etc) on my mp3 but only gives me 2 choices. Play from a certain song or the entire list. Kind of a nightmare when you have more than 80 songs in it.4. Cannot organize songs order after I added to the device. Even from the list that appears on the software.5. Buttons have a slow response.6. Radio reception kept really bad even after upgrade."
5,Branded name is so worth it!!!!!!!,"This is my first Gibson and it took me so long to save up so that I could get it.I gotta say that it was so worth the wait.I have had epiphone, fender, ibanez, squire, washburn ... but gibsons, my dream guitar, are so awesome.The way you grab, the way you play is just magical, there is no comparison to the way it sounds with others I've had."
1,Do not buy this laptop!,"I bought this model laptop in February of 2007. In November of 2007, the screen split in two. I called HP who initially refused to repair it under warranty. After much hassle, they agreed it was under warranty and repaired it. Now, in November of 2008, the video card has gone out. Again, HP is refusing the repair, and we have gotten a quote of $800 to repair it. A laptop of less than two years old and it is worthless."
1,IT'S BETTER TO THROUGH YOUR MONEY TO THE GARBAGE!,"My sister and I and a friend bought the same computer less than two years ago and they are giving us the same problems.The screen split in half, gets crashes, the charger and cord are broken, everything seems to be falling apart, etc....I've been reading lots of reviews and it seems like a lot of us are having the same problems, I do believe we should all contact HP and complain about it!!We paid $1400 each for 3 computers that lasted less than two years! I dont think I will get any money back and at this point It is worthless to try fixing them, I will try to call again and complain....Never again I will buy a HP!!!!!"
3,"Informative and entertaining, but needed some editing and proofreading before going to press","I purchased this book for a History class on the Civil War. It was used to complement other books such as The Killer Angels, Twelve years a slave, and Confederates in the Attic. The book is full of interesting documents that helped in better understanding the other readings and class lectures.There is a major problem with typos. The book is full of them, and though you can easily comprehend the text and understand the sentence, it is annoying and burdensome. This should have been better proofread for typographical errors and misspellings."
3,"Very Nice, But May Not Please Old Fans","Caravan, led by original member Pye Hastings and apparently still going strong, released this album of all new material back in 1995. It certainly is not another ""Land of Grey and Pink"", but then, it's not 1971 anymore, either. What it we have here is a beautifully performed and produced collection of mostly mid tempo pop/rock songs. Pye Hastings always excelled at writing this kind of material, and has retained his writing, playing, and singing skills over the years. There is very little jamming, but brother Jimmy Hastings provides several nice flute and sax solos. The graceful arrangements feature organ, piano, violin, acoustic and electric guitars. Frankly, this isn't a ""progressive"" rock album, but a pleasant listen it is none the less."
2,Big and noisy,"My 9 year old loved this thing...for about an hour. It's really cool and really fast. BUT, it is also very big and very loud. As the car whips around, Spiderman launches it at Doc Ock trying to knock him over. We've had problems getting Doc Ock to sit back up and sometimes the car goes too fast to whip around the track the way it should."
1,A total waste of money,"I made the mistake of ordering this product without reading any of the reviews... no words can even come close to describing the amount of frustration you would feel trying to use this software... as for me, I could not even get passed getting the activation code... I tried to get support but I am begining to seriously think that they don't even exist or even if they are a legitamate company... beware..."
1,This product deserves negative stars!!!,"Wow, did I get burned. I had a good experience with Magix's Audio Cleaning Lab, so I just assumed this product would be good-- not bothering to check out the reviews here in advance. I bought it at Best Buy this afternoon and threw it in the trash this evening! I have also been burned by the Sony Sound Forge $70 version (worthless) and the CakeWalk Pyro software. $30 down the drain... ouch!!"
1,weak,the music here doesn't work for his Light voice.Brandy will Last he never will start.at best he is a 3rd tier Tevin Campbell or 2nd tier Usher.Let it Go was so-so and the rest of the disc is Boring.
2,BEWARE--Not Original Recordings,Just another time I've gotten burned. These songs are all newly recorded re-releases...no originals here.
3,"Still Kool Kieth, but he could have done better........","When I first listened to this album, one of the first things I noticed... (and you will too) Man, those beats are kinda whack! Keith decided to not call Q-bert or Kut Masta Kurt and went with an Amateurish second rate producer...The beats on this album all sound like it took like 2 minutes to make them..plus there are scarcely any record scratches...Also, the Lyrics aren't tripped out, but I understand this album was meant as Keith's tool to vent on the industry, however, he has a reputation to uphold.On the other hand, I'm glad to hear anything from Kool Keith, as he is the ""baddest MC"" but next time, dude, just go with Automater!"
4,Still Double K,"Definitely not up to par on the usual Kool Keith style, but still better than any other piece of hip-hop out there."
2,Good Player At First...,"I first got this mp3 player for $120 probably about a year ago. The memory is only 64 mb and it held about only 14 songs for me so I bought a 128 mb card. Then one day I turned it on and it said upgrader on it. Sometimes I'd have to bang it to get it to start working again like I think some other lady said on another review. It sounds like there is a spring loose inside. I tried to update the firmware but it doesn't work. Well anyways, for the first almost year I had been using this, it has been working fine but now I can't even get it to play my songs. I would suggest getting the Rio Karma or another brand of mp3 player."
2,1 drip ruined it,"Had and liked my S10 for 1.3 years, only using it to work out and run. The headphones were useless, however, the player itself was good. Downloading songs was easy if you are computer literate. My problem is that when I was running I wiped a drop of sweat from my hand and it went onto where the earphones connect into the player. This zapped the player into a $120 hunk of useless integrated chips. Design flaw on a sport type of MP3 player. Also, the menu button stuck (I saw another comment about the same problem).When I got it to turn on at one piont I downloaded a newer firmware (easy to do) and now it just works when it wants to. I have to take the battery out for 20 minutes then restart it to get it to sometimes work. Customer support said they would not fix it for the $59.00 non-warrenty charge because I took the back of the player off to unstick the menu button.I'm looking for another MP3 player and it won't be a RIO."
3,the bad thin about this,i like the color of this mp3 player and its fast...but it only holds at the most 15 songs and i dont want to spend 80 dollars on a memory card...try to find a better one.
2,Disappointing.,"Instead of being a fascinating account of a crucial period in the history of the Christians and Druzes in Mount Lebanon and Syria, the book appears to be an obvious attempt at demonizing the victims and justifying the massacres. It is disappointing that so much bias was camouflaged as an objective interpretation of historical events. On several occasions, the book gives the impression that the author's interpretations of events constitute the ultimate truth. At times, this is done without taking into consideration even the interpretations of the people whom the book uses as references. The only beneficial part of the book is the extensive bibliography, otherwise very disappointing."
1,Endlessly bored,"I had read all of Jodi Picoult's book. When I got my Kindle for Christmas, I found this one and thought I had to read it as well. I couldn't get into this one at all. It takes forever to understand who the characters are and then once you find out what is going on, you don't like them. Unless you have an intense love for the song of the humpback whale, don't bother. The characters are very badly explained and the back and forth is exhausting. Jodi's other books are so well written and pull you in to the story immediately. As my friend just told me...don't read it...who is going to care. So I quit reading it about a quarter of the way through."
5,I haven't read a book by Piccoult that wasn't a keeper.,"I think it actually better not to say too much about Piccoults novels. She always manages to do something with the plot you are not expecting, so the less you knwo the more interesting it is. Her novels always keep me ingrossed until I have read it all the way thorugh, usually in a sitting or two. She brings voices to her characters, and to all her characters, not just one main character. What does love mean? How about a career? Read this and find out."
3,Not up to Picoult's par,"Normally, Jodi Picoult's novels pull me and don't let me out until the last page. I didn't feel taht way with this book. It was slow-moving and I feel the 2 love stories were not developed at all, so that I didn't really care about them. I bought this on the Kindle and there were TOO MANY spacing typos, making it difficult to read."
4,Songs of the Humpback Whale: A Novel in Five Voices,"For years, Jane Jones has lived in the shadow of her husband, renowned San Diego oceanographer Oliver Jones. But during an escalating argument, Janes turns to him with an alarming volatility. In anger and fear, Jane leaves with her teenage daughter, Rebecca, for a cross-country odyssey. Charted by letters from her borther Joley, they are guided to his Massachusetts apple farm, where surprising self-discoveries await. Now Oliver, an expert at tracking humpback whales across vast oceans, will search for his wife across a continent, and find a new way to see the world, his family, and himself: through her eyes. The story is told in five different voices which at the start i found a bit difficult to understand as this is a very unusual way of writing, especially with Rebecca telling the story backwards: ) but once you get into the novel it becomes more clear. A very good read and i will read more of Picoults books."
3,Songs of the Humpback Whales,It took me awhile to get into this story because of the several characters and the bouncing back and forth in time.Would have liked it to stick to a time line more. Overall enjoyed the story as Jodi Picoult always makes you think about relationships. Didn't like the ending.
3,Jodi's Debut...,"I am a huge fan of Ms. Picoult's work but her first novel, while good, didn't win me over like her other works of fiction.I liked the idea of writing the story from five different points of view but unfortunately parts of the book became repetitive. While we did get to know the characters very well and were able to understand why they acted the way they did, I found parts of the book a little confusing. Having Rebecca's character tell the story backwards took away from the ending. I knew what was going to happen.Jodi does come through however in her beautiful and lyrical writing. She has a way of conveying a feeling that is both touching and honest.While this book is not my favorite by this author, I will continue to read her novels. Her work only got better from here. Harvesting the Heart is a shining example of her true writing ability."
3,An interesting first novel,"I am a HUGE fan of Jodi Picoult and found it necessary to read her first book. This was my least favorite of her books.I could definitely tell this was her first book. It was a little hard to follow at first, because she switches time in illogical order. There are quite a few times where the book becomes redundant, causing me to suffer through deja vu. There are several conversations that take place several times in the novel because you are reading from the point-of-view of a different character, and I found this confusing.The plot idea is interesting, but the presentation was a disappointment. Unless you are an avid fan of Picoult's and have read several of her books, do not let this be your first experience with her. She is a phenomenal writer and simply struggled through this first novel."
3,a fantastic piece of work!,"My dad turned me on to Greg Brown this spring. He bought the CD down from Atlanta to visit, beaming with pride that a fellow Iowa boy had been getting such critical aclaim. I was suprised to see how strong Brown's cult is, and since hearing this album, his name and music seems to be turning up everywhere.Greg's voice is low, rumbling, strong but wavering. His songwriting is in the tradition of Bob Dylan/Bruce Springstein - a solid mix of blues, country and rock and roll. If you like these other songwriters, I urge you to buy this.People like Greg Brown, Wayne Hancock and Lucinda Williams are the best thing country music has going for it after decades of trash.'Lullybye' is my favorite track, but the whole album is good."
3,Coasting,"Each of Brown's last several albums has refreshed his artistry: The Poet Game was a unified and sober reflection on the relevance of his craft; Further In's acoustic impressionism foregrounded his elegiac, tender side; Slant Six Mind returned to a more overtly-masculine expression where even the ballads retained a certain edge.Covenant offers no surprises or refreshment. Certain songs can be traced stylistically to various albums from Brown's recent past, not a problem in itself but I feel I can call the shots before they're made, and some of the melodies are crudely simple. Also missing is some of that layering of meaning and wit that defines many of his best lyrics.However, Covenant is a solid album, and in particular the first two tracks continue the high standard Brown set for himself with Dream Cafe and his subsequent works. Fans will appreciate the craft on display here, but new listeners may wish to dig deeper in the catalog."
2,Disappointingly conventional,"A long-time fan of Brown, I got this the day it came out. Except for the first couple of songs, the rest of the album is rather conventional and finds him exploring rather mediocre C&W styles & themes. As another reviewer noted, there is an almost total absence of his usual wry wit, and very little of the lyrical and musical complexity at which he excels. Sigh."
4,Intriguing tale,"MURDER AT LOW TIDE is well-written with characters and plot tantalizingly unfolding as the reader progresses through the story. Family and financial concerns underlie the basic 'who done it?' plot. Police procedures and financial trusts seem to have been well-researched. I stayed up one night to finish reading the book, and for me, who normally retires early, that is saying something."
5,THE CHURCH GOD INTENDED,"If you want to see the Church of Scripture, the Church that God established on Earth that we chose to change, this is the road map back. This is what many theologians will not address. Too many denominational leaders are too fearful to giver up control of what they have.(If it didnt matter who would be in charge we could get alot done) Church has become a preference more than a conviction. If you want to know how to bring the total church together on earth this is your guide. Lets put the Body of Christ back together. "" This do in RE-MEMBERING ME (Rememberance of Me)"""
5,The Master of Doom Unveiled (kinda),"If you purchase this book hoping to find out more about the personal life of Thomas Ligotti, you're out of luck. His interviews are as enigmatic and mind boggling as ever, his brilliant essay (hilariously defaming the mystique of the vampire) and a few mild speculations on 'how Ligotti came to be Ligotti' make the book worth reading. Anyone who is an avid fan of Ligotti will instantly recognize Matt Cardin's poignant essays, analysis of his stories, and longstanding interviews such as ""Disillusionment Can Be Glamorous"". Perhaps the highlight of the book is David Tibet's short but sweet essay on his personal relationship with Ligotti, including an excerpt from an amusing letter which Ligotti apparently wrote after watching the horrible ""Mars Attacks"". All in all, this is more than worth buying and putting in one's personal library along with Lovecraft's letters, Poe's stories, as are the rest of Ligotti's masterpieces."
1,Not a good book,"If you are just trying to learn polymer chemistry, this book is too complex for you. It may be good as a reference text, but I doubt it. The exercises don't coincide well with the material and the main concepts get lost in too many specifics. Skip this book if at all possible"
5,magix movie edit pro 10,"Magix Movie Edit Pro ""10"" is way more awesome than ""15"" movie edit software I prefer... I am Paul Stark."
2,2 stars at best,"It will pick up animal hair off wood floors. Has no effect on carpet, whatsoever. Has all the power of a $10 drugstore dust vacuum. Way underpowered.Product, not much. Amazon was as always, excellent."
2,Noisy!,"I guess this works alright, but it is so incredibly noisy that I turn it off before the job is done. I would not recommend it for those with sensitive ears."
4,Does the job,"Because of our light need for the stick vacuum, I got a more low end model. The Boss gets the job done on our hard wood floor and surprisingly doesn't clog with hair or other small particulates.The only downside is that it seems to not be very sturdy. While I haven't had any problems myself, I doubt it could take a real beating. This isn't a surprise for the price range it was in."
1,ANTOnline is an unreliable vendor.,"I ordered in time for delivery by Christmas. 5 days after the item was supposed to ship, I received an email (which happened just 2 days before Christmas) stating that my order had been canceled. No further explanation than this was provided. When I called Amazon to inquire about why the order had been canceled, they were finally able -- after a little under 15 minutes of searching -- to determine that ANTOnline does not have the item in stock even though they still list 8 available on their website. Needless to say, my wife won't be receiving one of the 2 items she requested for Christmas this year... all because ANTOnline is incapable of updating the availability of their products on their website. I find this to be not only poor customer service but also lazy and irresponsible. I DO NOT recommend using the vendor ANTOnline."
5,A tasty read,"This book made me late for everything...I couldn't put it down to attend to my regular life! The author is a deft storyteller with a rich emotional clarity: She absolutely pinpoints every nuance of feeling in scene after scene. Plus she's extremely funny. Her lead character, Lily, is strong and smart (and clueless), and for some reason I love how she describes herself at one point: ""slightly off-kilter, motor running full blast, but basically okay."" I had a lot of fun with this book; I'd go anywhere the author takes me."
3,H. Head-a reader,"I have read one of this author's non-fiction books before I read this one. This book was good, there was some expected and unexpected twists. I will probably read more of her books."
3,"its fun, but......","I bought this toy brand new for my little 6 year old for xmas. only on xmas it was opened and the skydancer flys great, however the bubbles all leak out of the battery compartment making the bubble part of it useless(would not even blow bubbles just kept leaking). we called the manufacturer and apparently these are not made anymore so they offered to send us something of equal value---however they did not let us choose what that would be. so my child decided to keep the toy as the skydancer still flew. dissappointed the bubbles didnt work, if they did i would have rated this toy 5 stars for the fun factor!!!"
5,Seeger on Love,"For those who have always enjoyed Seeger's work, this album is a blessing--clever, musically adventurous, and full of the Seeger knack for accompaniment. For new fans, it is the perfect introduction to Seeger's style and songwriting. Seeger, whose music has mainly been political and traditional, makes a bold and wise step with this album of love songs."
4,Gay life in Brazil,"I read this in Portuguese (Devassos no Paraiso). One could perhaps wish for more history and less activism. Believe it or not, the history of homosexuality actually does not consist of talking about little activist groups and their publications. The illustrations will probably give ""nice"" homosexuals a fit, since they tend towards the lurid."
2,Living Moss - Looks Dead,"The moss I received was nothing like the picture. When I received it in fact it looked brown and overly wet.I tried to revive it, but it's still brown."
2,a disappointment from kettler,"i am a big kettler fan, but this baby locomo was poorly made, missing a part, and a huge disappointment for the price... nearly everything we have purchased from kettler has been exceptional (you occasionaly need a missing bolt sent, but they comply quickly), so we got this baby kettler ride-on expecting no less... even though we'll still buy lots of kettler, this is one item we will tell everyone not to purchase again! sorry kettler, but do a better job on this one next revision!"
1,Will never buy again.,"Not only did it not work properly, but it also distorted all sound in my computer. I am glad that I am a computer technician and could repair the damage that was done. Expecting a FULL refund. BE CAUTIOUS BUYING THIS CARD!"
3,Beware of CD,"I installed the card after removing previous audio software and bios settings. Then came the software install which didn't work properly right away. Crust of the matter, it corrupted my operating system!!!! After reinstalling my whole PC system, I downloaded the driver directly from C-Media and it installed properly. So far, so good! Throw the cd away!"
1,Not worth price,"Buyer beware...this ship is only about 11 inches long and not of the larger model versions usually sold for these prices. I just bought it for my grandson for Christmas and returned it when it arrived and I saw how small it was. I thought it would be about the size of the Queen Anns Revenge that was recently released. I should have paid closer attention to the specs, but for the price I just assumed it to be a larger play version. This ship would be fine for about $30.00 but not for the current selling price of 149.00. Not sure why it is so high."
3,"Fun, but i was comparing....","I guess if you havent read Meg Cabot or Sophie Kinsella, Rose Wilkins comes across as an inteligent writer with original plotlines and funny jokes. I, however, have read books like this before. So when i started reading So Super Stylish, i was unimpressed. The characters arent very strong and it wasnt an unputdownable book. But it looks like Rose Wilkins had a surge of creativity towards the middle of the book, because the latter half of the book is much better, and it starts to get even more interesting towards the end.Overall, this is a good read for youngsters and quite enjoyable, but if i had to recommend another book instead of this, i'd reccomend a Meg Cabot book. Because really, you cant go wrong with Meg."
1,a truly biased view,"Dr. Dattoli touts brachytherapy above all else, even though studies have shown that surgery offers surer long-term results, important especially for younger men who don't want their cancer to recur down the road. Seed implants can leave areas of the gland undertreated. Also, the idea that radiation causes fewer side effects is bogus. In fact, in addition to urinary and erectile problems, men getting radiation in any form run the risk of bowel problems."
2,stolen riff,"the leadriff of ""I Don't Wanna Be"" or was it ""I'm a wannabe"" !?is from Stone Temple Pilots' ""Vasoline"" (1994), and that's about the only ""catchy"" song on the album, but it doesn't sound anything new or fresh, or even that good! This just another one of those commercial sugar artist, and he wont be remembered after a year or two, Gavin is a criminal in music, yes! they're criminals, the ones doing it only for the money."
5,it's the kind of cd that just stays in your cd player,"quite honestly one of the best cds i own. if you like something with substance, something with soul... this album is probably for you. he's got a smooth voice but it's got character. he often sounds like stevie wonder, glenn lewis or maxwell... which is GREAT.... but somehow he manages to make the sound all his own. he's got a realness about him. check it out... you won't be sorry i guarantee it."
5,*****GREAT FROM START TO FINISH*****,"Bought this CD after I saw Bo Bice's performance of 'I Don't want to be' on American Idol. Liked the song when Bo sang it, love when Gavin does. In my opinion Gavin is a artist who always stays true to his art. Sound is fresh and inspiring with great vocals.All songs are good, but my favorite three are: Belief, Follow Through, and Chariot.""A MUSIC MUST HAVE"""
5,Genuine Talent!!,"Gavin Degraw is an incredibly talented singer/songwriter. All songs are from the heart and everyone can relate to them. ""Follow Through"", ""Just Friends"", even ""Overrated"" are songs that tug at your heart and have you singing them over and over. Not too ""poppy"" or mainstream. Overall, a good range in melodies. If you like John Mayer, you'll love Gavin!!"
4,Finally!,"Finally,Music........not overproduced, not synthesized. Just talent. Real musicians playing intruments and vocals sung from the heart with a style that covers all styles. Excellent songwriting with great presentation. Gavin is comfortable across many moods and tempos. I saw him recently on Pepsi Smash and he's just as comfortable on stage reproducing the music with an added energy.Buy this!"
3,One To Grow On,"I caught the title track while tooling around on-line one day and liked what I heard. So, I decided to pick up the whole album. It's not a record I immediately fell in love with. This one's taking awhile, but it's definitely starting to grow on me. Degraw's strength lies in the delivery and craftmanship of his songs. His lyrics leave a little to be desired (it's not the first time I've heard ""Your love fits me like a glove"" and it certainly won't be the last!). The sticker on the CD cover is a little misleading. I can kind of hear the Billy Joel reference, but I don't understand where they think he sounds like Van Morrison. I think his music can be easily compared to A.J. Croce. ""Chariot"" is worth checking out. A good first effort for an artist who's easily on his way. Like his lyrics say, ""Oh, this is the start of something good. Don't you agree?"" Yes, I do."
1,booorriinngg,"I've got to agree completely with""a music fan""from chicago,and harrisburg.I was impressed with his energy on the tv show,then I checked him out on amazon's preview and wow was I let down.Thanks amazon,you just save me some cash I can spend on something fresh."
2,Besides the one song.... more John Mayer style junk,"After I heard the theme song to One Tree Hill, I thought there might be something to Gavin Degraw and was stoked to check it out. Unfortunately (besides the song ""I don't want to be"") its pretty much the same cookie cutter, crappy accoustic, John Mayer type, cheesy kind of ""rock"". If you like hanging out at coffee shops and the mall then this will probably be right up your alley. If you like real rock music don't bother."
5,Awesome album.....fantastic talent,"I had the pleasure of catching Gavin live when he opened for Maroon 5 at Northern Lights in Clifton Park. Gavin was absolutely fantastic. He is a rare talent indeed and his music style is something I have never heard before. I went out and bought his album the next day and haven't turned it off yet. Get this record, you won't regret it. And while I'm on the subject, pick up Maroon 5's ""Songs for Jane,"" the best album to come out this year."
5,Amazing up and coming star..,"This is definately the best CD I have bought in a long while. All of his songs have their own feeling to them, and they straddle a few different genres of music. His music is one of a kind. I'd say if you like Jack Johnson, John Mayer, Howie Day, or anyone like them, you will love this CD! He is a dynamic new artist, and will without a doubt be a big star very soon!"
5,An Inspiration of originatlity,"Gavin Degraw is a breath of fresh air for musicians, singers, and even listeners. His unique blend of soul, jazz, and rock has affected me personally as a performer and songwriter. There is always the search for the perfect lyrics, but as seen in many of Gavin's songs, he was just being himself; writing what he was comfortable with and genuine. This album is superior and will affect people in ways that even Gavin will not be able to fathom. However, there is one album that is better, and that is ""Stripped."" This album breaks it all down and exposes Gavin at his finest. The raw talent demonstrated is unlike any other. The emotion infused into every song, and the tightness of the band gives this album a step above the rest. I can't say enough good things about these albums except that I have been affected as a writer and musician."
5,Promising Talent,"Fantastic, passionate and beautiful is what I have to say about Gavin DeGraw's debut album. I am looking forward to catching him live because I imagine that his passion and energetic voice, which one senses through his album, only enhances and adds fullness to the music and lyrics. His voice does remind me of Stevie Wonder and his piano skills are Billy Joel-like as other reviewers have said, but I must say he stands in a category of his own. The lyrics are mature and experienced and Gavin's energy makes the album an instant favorite on my list. Buy it and smile, for this is only the beginning for a promising talent."
5,amazing cd...do yourself a favor and buy it,"i bought gavin's cd on a whim after hearing good things about him, and allow me to tell you i was not disappointed. this is a guy who knows where hes going and is on his way to getting there fast if he keeps putting out discs such as this one. track after track i was mesmerized by his incedible lyrics, amazing piano driven melodies, and great voice. let me assure you, if you purchase this cd, you will not be let down. standout songs such as ""i dont wanna be"", ""belief"", and the title track ""chariot"", will pull you in and you will not be able to free yourself from the wonders of this artist."
5,Great New Artist!!!,"Great new artist, Great CD with 11 great songs NO filler. This is the real deal. Billy Joel, Elton John, and Spingsteen did not have such a great first release. At last a artist who can write."
5,Wow,"The hype surrounding up and coming artist Gavin DeGraw definetly proved warranted when his debut CD was released this week. Already seen on Carson Daly's NBC show ""Last Call"" and featured on the WB's Pepsi Smash DeGraw is a force to be reckoned with. With catchy lyrics, and an incredible talent for the piano ""Chariot"" is a fun, and easy to relate to album that pulls you in on the first listen, and keeps you coming back for more. From the first track and single ""Follow Through"" to the very end of the CD there is absolutely no question that DeGraw is here to stay, and is a much needed, and refreshing change from the many singer/songwriters and their acoustic guitars that are currently flooding the charts."
5,The start of something good . . .,"Gavin DeGraw is going to be a household name. His debut album, Chariot, is filled with songs that ring with influences ranging from Elton John to Sam Cooke, with a little bit of Jeff Buckley thrown in for good measure. The songs will stay with you long after the first listen, and you will find yourself singing ""I don't want to be anything other than what I've been trying to be lately"" for days to come. His lyrics and musicianship are equally as strong. With this amount of talent, it is clear that this guy will be with us for the long haul."
5,GaViN DeGrAw review- awesome CD!!!!!,"Gavin Degraw's cd is so awesome, i love it! His songs connect with so many people in so many ways. Plus, every single one of his songs has a different and unique style. All he wants to be is himself, and his songs are a perfect reflection of that. I personally love his CD Chariot. I made all my friends listen to him for the first time and not one of them werent singing along within a minute of the songs!!! He doesnt disappoint anyone here. If you ask me, you should purchase this CD, even if you dont know who he is, you will most likely like him."
4,a very interesting book!,"I saw Shirley McClains ""Out on a Limb"" several years ago and it really got me interested in Peru and Machu Picchu. Now that I have read this book, I am determined to go. I truely feel pulled to visit there - I imagine a lot of people will feel this way after reading this book. It sounds like a truely mystical place to grow spiritually and learn about yourself.I like that the author does not just write about her initiation, but includes her first stay in Peru in her story. Her first encounters with the Apus and the first group she joins shows how one must be strong and trust your intuition."
5,a personal door to my roots,"This book was a personal door to my roots. Originally I am a Kechwa native American. But I am adopted to Dutch parents when I was young. Since a copple of years I have 'strange' experiments. By this book I now know what that means. Every word is true, a real reflection of the other level of life wich western cultures have forgot. I hope this book will be a door to the real world of Kay Pacha. Mark Lucana Champi-van Deursen"
4,Fun for both baby and cat. :),"My son likes them. They roll, they make sounds. He likes to shake them. He doesn't so much as chase them. He prefers the balls of his hammer toy. I can't give them a full five stars. Maybe if they also bounced, but that's probably too much to ask for. I recommend these for curious babies who like to follow objects across the floor. I have also caught my baby taunting the cat with one of them. It was funny."
3,"Slow drama, kinda sad, but very good acting.","I love all kinds of movies, this one was kinda slow, but kept me interested enough to watch it all the way through. Nick Stahl has a string of bad luck, and has alot of hard choices to make, and it leaves the viewer feeling kinda empty."
4,Insightful Book,"Another interesting book from Zimbardo. This book should be on the shelves of all who serve in an authority role (police officers, military, teachers, coaches, etc.)and others interested in human behavior. Could something like this happen to you?"
4,The Lucifer Effect,"Scary! The Lucifer Effect is a frightening story of the Stanford Prison Experiment and how quickly average people can assume roles so different from their usual selves. Although the Stanford Prison Experiment had to terminate early for humane reasons, one can certainly see how these concepts apply in situations such as at Abu Ghraib prison and during the Holocost.Anyone working in a prison or jail setting should read this book! Anyone who intends to conduct experimentation using human subjects should read this book!"
3,Finally the book,"Zimbardo forbidden experiment brought him fame and offered a look at the less proud dimensions on human nature. Humans are resitant to looking at this aspect of our capabilities. For the most part this is a correct tact for very few will be placed in circumstances where these inner forces will be called forward. However those few occasions happen at crucial junction and be come defining to individuals, groups or nations.His detailing of the experiment is numming and marginaly contributory to the point. I showed his film to my classes and found little in the book to add to the discussion. The issues he raises should make up the analysis of the news with its lust for revenue generating violence. Using a demon in the title is counter productive. Doing so infers an external causation of violence. Inhumane behavior is behavior by non-human beings yet we use the term for the cruel behavior of a person or persons.His information is paramount his delivery..."
3,Less Stanford Prison Experiment story time and more psychology,"Let me start by saying I have not finished the book, yet. I am very disappointed that the main focus is the Stanford Prison Experiment for the majority of the book. It's been a struggle to get through this dry content. I decided to skip/speed read the prison experiment almost entirely. It was bland and nothing more than story time. This was nothing more than filler. There were no psychological evaluations or explanations along the way. The Prison Experiment chapters felt as though I was reading fiction, blah. We shall see how the rest of the book turns out. Just glancing ahead it looks like the attention is redirected towards the aforementioned tragedies, finally!"
5,first impressions can be deceiving,"Honestly , I hated this album during the first listen. Slowly after that, I found myself curious as to what Rhett was saying. So I read along on the liner notes, only to discover that 'Too Far' was anything but ordinary. Just when you think hes speaking in riddles, out comes a line that hits so close to home that it makes you feel like your right on top of the epicenter. Song for song, it may be every bit as catchy as Wilco's- 'sumerteeth'. Thats saying alot considering 'To Far' is far removed from the pop undertones of summerteeth."
3,for those who liked the fast versions of turn back time,"A questionable inclusion as a single espesially before cuba libra. Possibly the last release off the album. One remix is good. I think aqua need to get someone else to do the music for the next album to get some ""real"" dance songs aka ""candy man"" ""roses are red"" If you like aquas faster tracks like me then buy it ""cheap"""
1,mislead and then ignored,"I ordered the book ""The Listener"" by Taylor Caldwell not knowing that it was part of a collection of exerpts of four authors. Seller did not state this in the offering. After buying and before shipping, when I questioned the seller, I received no answer. The book arrived and I shippd it back. Emailed seller twice and received no response. Will never deal with this seller again."
5,SE ME ACABARON LAS ANGUSTIAS Y,"LAS REPETICIONES !Este libro me da UN PLATILLO FUERTE PARA CADA DÍA...¡SABROSÍSIMOS TODOS !Y fáciles de preparar...y como es comida rica para el diario, NO SALE CARA !"
4,Cool Key Ring,This is one of those things that is very simple but is very cool. Its just a little loop of plastic-coated wire that retains its round shape and has a very functional little closure. I use it to hang keys or little tools here and there. You really have to have one to appreciate it fully.
4,&#50676;&#49632;&#44256;&#47532; &#49104;&#47564; &#50500;&#45768;&#46972;...,&#50668;&#47084;&#44032;&#51648; &#50857;&#46020;&#47196; &#49324;&#50857;&#51060; &#44032;&#45733;&#54624;&#44163; &#44057;&#45348;&#50836;.&#51104;&#44552;&#51109;&#52824;&#44032; &#50557;&#44036; &#48520;&#50504;&#54616;&#51648;&#47564;&#50676;&#49632;&#44256;&#47532; &#51060;&#50808;&#50640; &#55092;&#45824;&#54256; &#50672;&#44208;&#44256;&#47532; &#48143;&#44592;&#53440; &#50672;&#44208;&#54616;&#45716;&#45936; &#49324;&#50857;&#54616;&#47732; &#50836;&#44596;&#54624;&#44163; &#44057;&#49845;&#45768;&#45796;.&#49324;&#51060;&#51592;&#44032; &#51089;&#44596;&#54616;&#51648;&#47564; &#49353;&#49345;&#46020; &#45796;&#50577;&#54644;&#49436; &#44316;&#52270;&#45348;&#50836;&#51116;&#51656;&#51060; &#45908; &#44204;&#44256;&#54616;&#45796;&#47732; &#51339;&#51012;&#44163; &#44057;&#49845;&#45768;&#45796;.
3,Nice enough,"I like the flexibility of the key ring and its a god size, the shipping took forever, and I have to say the clasp could use some work, but I'm still using it today... Soo I would buy it again."
2,Much smaller than pictured,Ordered two of these. When they arrived I was surprised at how small they were compared with the picture. Picture indicates they are much larger. Not only are they small in circumference but the wire itself is very small so you have to wonder how strong it is. I also had to pay postage due because the vendor did not have enough postage on the package. Sent them back and am still waiting on a refund.
5,Simple yet effective,The Lucky line key ring one of those devices that just save you time and make life better. No more breaking fingernails and taking 5 minutes to remove keys. This device lets you remove and add keys in seconds. It's very durable and affordable.Highly recommended.Pro's:* Affordable* Ease of use* Makes life betterCon's:* None
4,great music,"all i can say is listen to samples, and hear it for yourself.... it would be nice to have more of this type of music..."
1,Don't Bother,"If you've used a Mac for more than six months you probably already know 90% of what's in this so called ""Desk Reference"". Taking just one chapter (Jamming with iTunes and iPod) as an example:* The discussion of the iPod is confined to one page, 4 paragraphs. It ends with ""The best thing I can say about the iPod and iTunes combination is ... well ... that there isn't anything else to say about them.""* There is a mention that you can store Address Book information and your iCal info on your iPod but nothing to tell you how to do it.* The book makes no mention of sampling rates when it discusses ripping CDs for iTunes.* The book doesn't mention Smart Playlists at all.Don't waste your money like I did."
1,Don't buy flash drives from Simple Tech,"I recently ""upgraded"" from the 1GB Sandisk Cruser to the 2GB Simple Tech. The write speed is INCREDIBLY SLOW! A one MB file, while instant with the Sandisk, took 10 seconds with this Simple Tech drive! I first thought it was the machine. I changed to a different machine with USB 2.0. The same thing happend. The SanDisk worked faster on a USB 1.0 machine.Later I tried to delete a 40MB folder on it (It was copied onto from a USB 1.0 laptop, and it took more than 15 minutes!). You won't believe this, but the deleting took a few MINUTES to complete.A friend of mine had this 1GB drive. She returned it after experiencing the same thing.The read speed of it is very fast, comparable to the Sandisk."
3,"Ok Doc, good matches","I don't have much to say about this except to me the story part was kinda boring, and I have many DVD that have documentary and I find them enjoyable this one was just boring to me and I used to order the weekly PPVs. The best part of this dvd are the matches and the bonus section."
3,"Missing ""Sally Gardens""","One of my favorite tunes from the movie is not on this CD--the lovely instrumental version of ""Down by the Sally Gardens."" You can find it, however, on Alec Finn's ""Blue Shamrock."""
4,Freeze Caution,"Own a slightly older model than this one but it has the same Trigger gun as this model. Unit works well and have had no problems with it. Takes a little while to set up with all the hoses, electrical and loading of detergent but once operating it does the job. I live in climate where it gets below freezing and thought I drained the unit prior to winter so left it in my garage. Big mistake. The trigger gun has a chamber in it that doesn't drain so the water froze and cracked the plastic. Leaked so had to replace it ($40). If you live where it gets below freezing I strongly suggest you bring entire unit inside for winter or at least remove the trigger gun and store that inside."
5,Perfect replacement for OEM,Shipped in two days as promised by Amazon. Took around 5 minutes to replace and the action on my gate is now smooth as butter. I replaced both the left and right at the same time. You can order the same part (as I did) for each side because the bottom bolt assembly can rotate. I would order these StrongArm lift supports again.
3,Better than staring at a wall,"I use this program every now and then. Initially, I used it quite often but after a while it got old. It shows you the road, some scenery, and gives you incentive to keep grinding it out so in that sense, it accomplishes what it says it will. Production value is not too bad, but not high dollar either. For the price, I would recommend."
3,Where is the modern music?,"The music on this CD is good, but listeners will be led to think that Irish music has not evolved at all since the 1950s. There are plenty of Irish singers and musicians releasing their own excellent material these days in all genres, especially rock, pop, cabaret and singer-songwriter. The CD would be better if some of them were included."
2,Don't bother with this product!,"If you like to install, uninstall, reinstall and get tons of unknown errors, this product is for you.I am running this on a 3.2 Mhz Pentium brand new computer with Windows XP and there is no reason it should not work.To be honnest, I did get it to work for a while (including with a number of unknown errors) but I am unable to make it work again.I uninstalled and reinstalled several times and the software is unable to find the Adaptec hardware.Very frustrating and time consuming.No help from Adaptec either.This is a wanabe product that will drive you nuts!"
1,Only works with THEIR software!!!,"Just got one of these and tried to use it with Windows-Video and with Adobe Premiere - The drivers for this device are not standard and neither of these products can access the device. On TOP of all that, I can't take short clips from VHS tapes to make a holiday montage (remember the copyright free-use laws???) because the device detects Macrovision signal encoded on the tape. On the cover of the box it even says ""Convert any analog video to DVD or CD"", which is not true."
2,Numi's Bouquet Tea Set,"The tea is not quite what I expected. The ""flowers"" are already opened. Other teas of this type that I have had, have been tightly rolled up and expanded in the hot water to form the flower. That was a let down. The tea its self did have a good flavor. As for the pot, the lid has no catch so you have to try to hold it on when you pour, or it falls off (usually into the cup and splashes). The pot gets VERY HOT and is hard to hold - especially the lid. On the whole, I was very disappointed with this set. I would not recommend it to others."
4,Arrived On Time For Christmas,"I ordered alot of gifts this year online. I was very happy that the product was not only in stock, but arrived when promised. Not all of my purchases went that well. I still ended up at the mall last minute."
3,More decorative than tasty,I really like tea and this is so inventive. I love the look of the flowers when they bloom. It's great that they come with everything you need (the flowers and the pots). I used these as a novelty for awhile. The taste of the tea itself isn't that great. I bought a couple of these 2 years ago and I still have some. I will use them for visual stimulation. Then steep me a real cup of tea from some other tea bag.
4,very nice tea,"A great opportunity to test out different teas that please your pallet. This set of tea would make a really nice gift to yourself or to others and the neat part is that you can buy additional, individual teas without buying the whole set again.. If you like exotic flowers and tea you will love this. I bought this set as a gift for my mother in law cause we both enjoy tea. We tried the jade jewel first and it was wonderful. The flower was very pretty and the tea itself was very relaxing. Now I have to buy one for me to try."
5,Gift...,"Bought it to be part of a large gift basket I am making for Christmas so I don't know how it tastes and what the contents of the box look like but the box is cute and everyone else who has seen it has already called dibs on it if the recipient doesn't want to keep it. The box alone would go for what I paid for the set at somewhere like Pier 1. Also; the recipient has a young daughter, knowing how my niece reacted when we brewed our Primula flowering teas I imagine (even if it doesn't taste that good) both mother and daughter will be delighted."
4,"Great value, fragile teapot","At Amazon's price, this is a good value for this gift set. With this type of tea, you do need to use very hot water for it to flower. You can also use the flowering tea in a second and third steeping.However, the teapot is extremely fragile and hard to hold when full of hot tea, so take care handling it!"
1,Disappointed Tea Drinker,"This tea set was my reward for the hard work put into my flower gardens and it was with great anticipation that I waited for the package to arrive. How disappointing! The musty, dank smell hit me before I ever saw the contents of the box. It was so bad that I took it outside to open it for fear of releasing mold spores in my house. The tea pot is very small and fragile and I have yet to bring myself to try the tea because of the moldy smell. I would not give this as a gift. I am so very disappointed."
1,ugh,"received as a gift.. its sooooo tiny (1 teacup size),i could get flowers from outside if i wanted to see flowers in a pot..wish it was returnable, but since its in the 'grocery' category, its not.otherwise i could get something useful that is not a waste of money and space."
2,Not so good,"I give 2 stars for a great bamboo box,but so far the tea is not drinkable. Also without labels you don't know if you pour hot water on delicate green tea leaves or boiling water on the black leaves. I wouldn't buy it again. This review is for Numi Tea Bamboo Flowering Tea Gift Set Frustration-Free Packaging I got this gift box of Nami flowering tea leaves for Christmas. Sat down to my first cup this morning. No labels on the flowers so I decided to choose the darkest leaves as it might be the best morning tea. After pouring water over it a horrible smell came off of it. I had to pour it down the sink."
2,Looks so much better than it is.,"So, the tea didn't taste bad, and the box is adorable, but the ""flowers"" were mostly just brown crap and aren't at all like the photographs. The idea was interesting, but the actual product, not so much."
4,Numi Tea,I think this product is fun. The presentation of the tea blooming in the clear pot is so beautiful and the tea has a great flavor. I just wish they made some blooming teas that were decafinated. The only reason it did not get 5 stars is some of the tea fell apart in the water as the sewing came apart so it never bloomed. It is definately worth the purchase though.
3,Label ruined the box.,"I thought this would be a great mother's day present. I was wrong. My mother loves wooden boxes, well this one turned out too ugly to present to her. When the label was removed there was damage to the box, real damage. Looks like water damage to wood. I am disappointed with this purchase and I am keeping it for myself because I am too ashamed to give it to my mom."
1,Not for the true tea lovers,"Got this for myself since I do usually enjoy Numi tea bags.Howerver, I would NEVER consider giving this to any one as a gift!The box itself is very flimsy, the tea pot is a joke! There was no strainer included, the lid of the pot, does not even fit on the pot! It's very dangerous to pour hot tea when the lid does not want to sit on the pot! Yes, it was cool to see the flowers unfold, but it ends there.The color & the flavor is just not as impressive as what I had expected.I wanted to return the item, but LATER found out that as a ""grocery"" item, it is NOT returnable! I wish that had been noted on the item page or before I checked out!!! I do not recommend this item at all!"
3,Poor packaging,"The tea seems fine, although I have not had a chance to try it yet. The teapot is also lovely and adorable. The problem I had was with the box. Some of the parts weren't finished (the coloring of the wood) and then, when I took off the picture on the front, there were dead bugs underneath it. There were also dead bugs where the paper had been glued. Moreover, the glue would not come off, at all. For the price, the tea and the teapot were an good deal, but for someone like me who's scared of bugs.. it was a bit of a shock. I realize that many people had perfectly good boxes and no bugs, so I most have just got a bad one."
2,Little Disappointed,"The bamboo box smells terribly musty. The pot itself is cute and the tea, I hope, will be good. Not sure it's worth the money spent."
3,Kind of small,The actual pot is smaller than I had expected. And the box of bulbs is no bigger than a notepad box. I do not like the idea that it does not have a latch on the front. It has two slip knots on the side. The bamboo box itself is nice. I think it will work well in protecting the pot for storage purposes.
2,Horrible cheap tasting tea,I guess you get what you pay for. Teapot is super small and the tea tastes awful. I'd never give this as a gift.
1,Supa dupa garbage.,"What a thought provoking and creative album title.I wonder how long it took her to come up with that name?I cant believe the trendy garbage people listen to these days.All the songs sound the same and have the same pointless lyrics to them.She cant produce,rap write or do much of anything of value.I saw this trash at tower records and it was just collecting dust.Save your money and dont buy any of her worthless junk ever again.Listen to some real artists like black sabbath,judas priest or iron maiden.Dont forget to vote for my review."
2,Won't turn off completely,"I like the single spray pattern (multiple spray options that are never used was not needed) and the large pause button is a plus for arthritic hands but ---- in the off position it still sprays about 25%. Poor quality? Paid shipping to get it here, not paying more to send it back and pay more to get another that may or may not work."
5,best resource i have found,"am writing a thesis paper and this resource had the best information, was clear, covered the subject completely and accurately. would recommend it to anyone wanting information on the B-17 and the modifications."
5,"Best magic book since Now you see it, now you don't","This first volumn, is so good, I plan to buy the remaining 4 my next pay check. I have not seen a book in the magic world this good since the Now you see it, now you don't books. It is very clear in writing style. The illustrations are great. There are sidebars and tips to help you. This book and a deck of cards on an deserted island and I woudl be all set. Now if someone would do this type of book for coin magic I woudl be all set."
2,Its just not that good at all,"I love DT- but this album- is simply boring- Sherinian barly lifts a finger on this album- hardly displays his talents. HEavy song, soft song, heavy song, fast- uhhhhhhhh this album has nowhere NEAR the same replay value as their others."
3,Where is the Aunch!,"After being amazed by ""Images And Words"" I must say that I was dissapointed by this release. When did DT forget how to rock? There are a few good tunes...""Lines in the Sand"" and ""Anna Lee"". But the rest just hobble along without the magic of previous releases. Mike's lyrics seem, at times, rather un inspired. John P's lyrics are also not up to par....is this the same guy that wrote ""The Killing Hand""? The music sounds more like the Police....not enough aunch! I hope they aren't doing the 80's RUSH thing! Skip this one if your not a fan already.....Images and Words is a classic piece of progmetal!"
2,FALLING TO SLEEP,"ZZZ...You Not Me...ZZZ...Lines In The Sand...ZZZ...Peruvian Skies...ZZZ...Hollow Years...ZZZ, and i'm still tried. This is a very weak effort by a band that has potential to be really HEAVY. I mean, it sounds like the band is playing it safe, making every song sound like it's formatted to be a radio jingle. That's good for a song or two, but not an entire album. You just have to leter rip. All those songs mentioned above are good and accessable but not acceptable by a band that can crank out metal and prog like no one else can. Sorry boys, this one's a yawn."
4,It's Dream Theater. It's automatically good.,"Probably their most controversial album to date. The band, while still progressive, has gone in a more streamlined direction. Not as crunchy as Awake, which may disappoint many fans, but nevertheless a great listen. New Millenium and Lines In The Sand are the highlights of the album."
4,Familiarity breeds contempt...,"The rumor is Dream Theater sold out on this one. I wish other bands could sell out like these guys, but that's still an unfair indictment of the album. Granted, Falling Into Infinity doesn't take you all over the musical map... you know, the one they recreate every time they pick up their instruments. But it demonstrates they can rein in their incredible talent to put out an album that taps into a larger audience and which is quite listenable if you're not in the mood for an hour of world class shredding. For all the criticism, this was nothing more than a blip and a pretty impressive one at that. Lines in the Sand doesn't rock? They're still around and still awesome as ever. Enjoy a good album by an amazing band."
5,Damn fine CD!,"I'll avert from name calling, but the critics on here chewing this CD up really don't know what they're talking about. This CD is vibrant and alive, and it jumps right out at you. It did with me anyway. Perhaps this CD is a bit mellower than their other ones, but HEY, that still doesn't mean that it isn't any good. I really liked the way it was structured and laid out. DT definitely put some time and thought into this one."
3,Progresive Rock come AOR - Not DT at there Ultimate.,"Dream Theater are renowened for there unbeleivable musical ability. With there explosive and sometimes heavy playing, intertwining into a frenzy of complex songs. This album takes a somewhat different route. Instead they have gone for the mainstream approach, mixing typical AOR with Progressive Metal elements. Some of which works extremely well. Highlights on the album have to be the gorgeous 'Hollow Years', the headbanging 'Peruvian Skies', the Funky 'Lines in the Sand' and the electric 'New Millenium'. Unfortunatley the album didn't break them into the mainstream limelight as obviosly intended. Although this is probably just as well as they should stick to what there best at - Progressive Metal. Although its most definatly an Album I keep going back to, other DT fans may not agree. Mixed feelings on this Album but still a solid and respectable effort."
5,Great item,Our dog passed away and this a great reminder of him! Long live Moses! It is crafted very well and has a good design representative of an eskie!
4,Brilliant album but sometimes I just can't bear it,"Not because Tom's grizzled "" one-too-many-bourbons'n'cigs "" voice gets irritating ( although it might not help sometimes ) but the actual concept of the album seems a little too real for me. I feel like I'm the character in the music-movie and that I'm the one who seems perpetually lost in a lovelorn lust for a girl. The snow, the ice, how everything seems so weird and foreign - it's like going over traumatic holiday experiences which promised so much and left you empty handed. It seems so brutally honest, so pure, so raw, that it almost hurts you to relive the memories. The only break in the mood is Kommienezuspadt which only seems to heighten the weirdness it is being a foreigner on foreign soil. It's truly remarkable that you can get an album that is so viscerally visual set through music, but that's Tom's way. An amazing accomplishment!"
5,Maybe his best,"Too much ink has been spilled over Tom Waits for me to add anything of great value to his legacy. Let me just say this ""lost masterpiece"" might just prove to be his best to date. I wouldn't recommend it as a starting point for beginners (maybe Rain Dogs or Mule Variations for that), but his beautiful melodic/cacophonic style certainly comes to a head here. Only time will tell if this review hold true. Either way, I am very glad that Waits continues to add to his important catalogue, which all together is masterpiece that will last well into the future."
5,Tom at his Best !!!!,"I just want to say that this Tom Waits masterpiece blew me away. I did have to listen to it more then once early on to really absorb the material on Alice but I usually do the same with all of Tom's works. Some of my favorite tunes on Alice (in my opinion) are 'Fish & Bird', 'I'm Still Here', 'Flowers Grave' and 'Lost in the Harbour'. Get your hands on a copy of Alice you will not be dissapointed."
3,six swans,This book is about a girl that has to remain silent and not laugh for six years to turn her brothers into humans again. She also has to sew shirts for them during this time.The tale is alright. It shows women as heroines but in order to do it she has to sew; again women are oppressed. Read this story you will also learn about family fidelity.
3,Good book for basics - touching on advanced topics.,"This is a great book for the neophyte to get an overview of the basics of SBS 4.5. It does touch on some advanced topics, but those wanting more details had better look elsewhere. Although written with a keen sense of aliveness, numerous typographical errors throughout the book, kept this reader from giving it a higher rating."
4,I thought that the record was good but could've been better,The record had some good songs.There needed to be some more songs that everybody likes.
5,Best of the Series,"I thought this was the best of the Puzzle lady series as it had the most intricate plot so far. There are TWO not one weddings in the works here. And more than one mystery. I don't know if one was not a regular reader (had not read the previous books) if you would pick up on all the plot nuances, but this is a great read for those who have read all the others and are aware of the many previous ""relationships"" of the Puzzle Lady. The interaction between Cora and her niece are priceless."
1,no ink comes out,I ordered rhinotek magenta replacement for the Canon BCI-6M to use in my Canon S820 printer. The ink stays in the front compartment of ink and does not flow to the back compartment like it should. I ended up replacing with magenta cartridge from a different vendor.
4,in search of battery,I need an extra battery for my PV-GS39. I can't seem to find it anywhere. Can anybody give some info on where to find one.
4,LONG WAIT FOR BOOK,I HAD TO WAIT A LONG TIME FOR THIS BOOK. BUT DID RECEIVE IT AND WILL SEND IT ON TO MY GRANDDAUGHTER. I WANTED IT FOR A CHRISTMAS GIFT BUT DID NOT GET IT FOR THAT TIME. GLAD THOUGH THAT AMAZON KEPT TRYING UNTIL IT WAS AVAILABLE. THANK YOU.
3,"Melanie, Go Away","This is part of a series - I didn't know that, but the book can stand alone anyway. Is it ok to be unimpressed by this book? The cover drew me to it but, overall, I didn't find Melanie or her exploits all that entertaining. Melanie just came back from a trip to Spain where she met Miguel, a boy her age who comes to NYC and visits her there. Melanie shows him the sights and, along the way, we meet her friends and her other `love interest', Justin. The book is written in a diary format, and some of the drawings and rhymes were cute (but got annoying too). I would marginally recommend this book; the age group seems to be lower than the actual intended audience. The book also contained a lot of English/Spainsh words and translations, but did the author really have to spell out each Spanish word (LIKE THIS)? I found that really annoying and condescending too."
3,A Colorful Splash of Laughter!,"My daughters - a preschooler and a toddler - gravitate to Max and Ruby like magnets. The board book Ruby's Rainy Day proved no exception. Shiny foil raindrops splash across the book cover. Lively rainbow colors brighten the ten sturdy pages inside. The story itself is an abridged version of a comical episode on TV's Nickelodeon. Little brother Max wants to go outside to play ""Baseball!"" Big sister Ruby insists they both don layer after layer of rain gear first. Your child can learn colors while laughing at the antics of these lovable rabbits."
5,A favorite,"My god this is a great album. I'm a fan of 70s Krautrock and prog, but often times I think you have to put up with a good deal of boring not so great stuff in order to arrive at real gems when listening to bands like Amon Duul II or Can. With Ghost, it is like they filtered out all the annoying stuff and condensed all the good parts, then added lots of extra flair of their own. And Michio Kurihara's guitar tone on some of the tracks is unbelievable to me. Highly recommended."
2,Not so Japanese,"I was expecting more experimental noise than this Rock and soft jazz sound with a hint of Irish in it. I like this change of pace some what but, is it to good for it ownself. I hear a bit of Pink Floyd in this as well. Some people will like this right away, while others will have to listen to in several times before they really appreciate it."
1,Big trouble maker,"It worked one day for 8 hours, then took one day off. I mean it. 24 hours could not do anything about. Tried upgrading firmware to 5.3_5, tried reseting using the tiny button, tried cooling it off. Even the power LED was not stable. Then, it worked fine for another 4 hours, and refused to respond to me the next morning. I believe it freezes just seconds after initialization. My wife was screaming on me because I wasted so much time trying to figure out what happened. Search for ""mr814v2 problem"" on google and you'll see how many people complaining its quality. This unit is going back to shelf for sure!"
1,Netgear MR814 Wireless Router,"I have had no success with this product. Netgear doesn't provide warranty support for Macintosh computers and this router drops connection constantly. After doing a firmware upgrade, I could no longer to access the router to reconfigure, so it is essentially useless. I don't recommend this product for Macintosh users."
1,DISAPOINTED,I BOUGHT A WIRELESS ROUTER FROM AMAZON AND I CAN'T EVEN USE IT. FOR ONE NO SOFTWARE AND TWO I DON'T THINK IT EVEN COMES WITH A MODEM. I TELL YOU I AM VERY DISAPOINTED AND I WILL NEVER BYT ONE HERE AGAIN.
3,Difficult to configure,"I found the documentation that came with this router (even what was on the CD) was poor, and I was unable to configure it to support even one wired PC without calling Tech Support. The wait was 20 minutes, but the person who answered was professional and useful. After about 40 minutes of work, the router worked, and then connecting up my laptop wirelessly was easy.I had quite a bit more trouble getting WEP working to my home desktop. That required another > 1 hour call to tech support.This is my first experience with 802.11b, but I have to say I was not satisfied with Netgear. I would try another brand if I were buying another LAN."
4,Netgear MR814 802.11b,"This product has exceeded my expectations in every way.The setup process is pretty straighforward, and the tech support staff are quite helpful, and not to mention knowledgeable.A word of caution: If you are planning to use this product with Windows 2000 and Pac Bell DSL (now known as SBC Yahoo DSL), you will run into issues with DNS addresses. Pac Bell DSL typically refuses to help with routers unless the router has been supplied by them.I set up the same product with Windows 98 and Pac Bell DSL, and it works beautifully! I have 2 laptops with Netgear's MA401 wireless card."
1,Doesn't work with Verizon D-SLAM,"I live in an apartment building that is wired for Verizon DSL. No DSL modem needed, the building has a D-SLAM in the basement so I plug my Ethernet directly into the wall. It took me 3 calls, including one with a Level 2 tech, to figure out that this router won't work with this equipment lineup because the router can't handle the speed of the pipe coming out of the wall. Very frustrating! The first tech told me that the router was faulty, so I sent it back and ordered another one. It wasn't until I got the 2nd router and had my call escalated to the Level 2 tech that they admitted the router wouldn't work with my equipment."
1,You get what you pay for,"I bought this router a year ago with a Netgear wireless card thinking I got a good deal. Little did I know I ended up with one of the worst wireless routers out there. The range is only about 100ft, and you can't add an antenna or signal booster like other routers. I lost reception in the room next to the router almost everyday for no reason. The connection speed is sloooow on a good day. It is not compatible with many other wireless cards such as Linksys. And the list just goes on. I guess it is true you get what you pay for. There is a REASON this router is so much cheaper than other similar products out there. Nobody will buy it if the price is remotely comparible. Do yourself a favor, spend twenty more dollars and get a router that is worth keeping.(...)"
2,terrible tech support,"I purchased the MR814 in Feb.2003 and it worked fine for 6 months and then I lost my connection. I contacted tech support several times and had to wait each time 30 minutes or more. The system would work for sometimes a day and sometimes only a few hours after re-configuring and re-setting,etc, with the tech. Then I was finally sent to level 2 technical support and waited online for over an hour. He tried everything, then issued me a RMA for a return. I haven't recieved the new router yet, but will do another review after I recieve the new one. I also had to pay a $14.90 fee for the returning of the router. Unless you have a lot of time to spend online with technical support if something goes wrong, I wouldn't recommend buying this product."
2,"Wireless worked, port forwarding did not","As a web developer I needed my wireless router to have port forwarding so I could host ftp and web servers from my computer behind the router. Although the router allowed me to network the computers and connect to the Internet, port forwarding (although conceptually easy to set up) did not work. A call to Netgear tech support did not help. Returned it, bought linksys, and port forwarding worked first time."
1,Causes my cable modem to restart frequently,"I was disappointed after using the Netgear MR814v2 for more than a week to determine it causes my RCA cable modem (supplied by Comcast) to unexpectedly restart, losing my Internet connection, and to degrade the connection speed when it does work. The Netgear firmware upgrade did not resolve the problem. After going back to my non-wireless router, the Netgear MR614, all is fine and my cable modem no longer restarts unexpectedly. Comcast confirmed this is a problem with some routers. I didn't believe it at first, but after a week of troubleshooting I believe it now. I have always been a big fan of Netgear until this situation. I am returning the MR814v2 for a different brand and model of a wireless router."
3,"Great for cable, not recommended for DSL","I have bought 2 of these, one for a friend and one for myself.I used it for cable connection. It works perfectly, didn't have a single problem.My friend uses it for DSL. I have configured it for him. Since DSL goes through a connection process (which is not as simple as cable), there's a need for the router to be robust enough to recover from temporary problems, instruct the DSL modem to re-connect, and re-configure the connection properly. This router performs very poorly in that environment, and must be recycled regularly in order to recover. If you have DSL, this router is not the right product for you."
3,Good looks.. performance as good as D-link,"...Now it is here and after a 10 minute installation, it is up and ready. My only problem is that the signal strength is not very good. It works fine when my laptop is 2 feet away, but whenI put my laptop in another room (about 60 feet away), the signal strength fell to 50%. After moving it around through a few locations, I finally found a spot where the strength is about 90%.In essence, nothing great, but good value for the money.Now I hope my mail-in rebate comes in a couple of months."
1,Buyer beware: high failure rate,"Watch out!Amazon will ship you the new (smaller) revision of this router, the mr814b, which has a VERY high lemon rate! The router's wireless functions will stop working after a couple hours of use until you physically unplug it and plug it back in.I have personally seen two people (myself included) purchase the second revision of this router and have this problem. The routers had to be returned. I have NEVER seen one of these work properly. A search on the web will show many other people with the same problem. I highly recommend you choose a different router."
3,Easy to setup but not reliable,"Router easy to setup. However, locks up every couple of days and requires rebooting. No incoming logs."
4,Simple Setup,"I've had this router for a few months now, hardly any troubles and setup was easy. Reception is great around my condo and thru the immediate walls. The primary reason I bought it was price. Also I have had Netgear products previously and they all worked great.Gave it four stars for design, wish it was a stackable design. And the reset button would be more convenient in the front than the back."
2,Dissapointing,"I had the original version of this product. It worked great, covered the whole house even when installed in the basement. I never had dropouts from it. Unfortunately this one got fried when lighning struck the house.I had been so happy with it I went straight out and bought another. When I opened the box though I discovered I had the V2 model, which is about 1/3rd the size. This a much inferior product to the original. The range is much less and drop outs are regular, every few minutes, even when in the same room as the router. I've been back to the store once to exchange it but the replacement is no better. I'm going to return this one too."
3,Seems to have VPN issues,"I bought this router for a home network. According to the Netgear website (which is always extremely slow), the router is supposed to support outbound VPN connections using PPTP. After configuring everything, I found their claim to be only half right. VPN works fine for strict TCP/IP-based traffic (Intranet websites, etc.) but does not properly forward other types of traffic, such as what is required to map a network drive. (Anything using Netbios?)They had me talk to their support people three separate times to try to resolve. At the point they told me they would escalate my call to a system engineer, I returned the product and bought a Linksys, which performed flawlessly on all counts.With that said, however, as long as you are not doing VPN, the Netgear router should perform very well for you. It seemed slightly faster than the Linksys. (Though my signal strength was typically better with the Linksys.)"
1,Not compatible with DSL Provider modem,"Had the router working for about a day then would not work again. NetGear support was unable to resolve issue. Had to return. NetGear said my DSL providers modem (Verizon) was not compatible. Even though more expensive, going to buy a Linksys Wireless router. I have had no issues with before with my existing Linksys Non-Wireless router and the Verizon DSL Modem."
1,very un happy,"I spent 4 weeks with customer service, who were very patient and helpfull, but in the end we could never get it to work with my speedstream modem. I finally gave up, took my losses and bought a syslink."
2,Worked Great.... for 4 months,"I got this router for cheep and was very very happy with it untill it stoped working. Internet connection is spotty, slow, or lost compleetly. Rebooted, updated firware, no luck. Its a great product with great features... but it only lasted a few months."
2,Very very unreliable,"I would strongly advise against buying this router. When I first got it, I couldn't have the wireless part turned on if I wanted to get to the Internet. Customer service was useless the first few times, and then they led me through this absurdly complicated procedure to do a special reset on the router. Now the reouter occasionally just dies on me, requiring me to unplug it and plug it back in to get it to work again. It's phenominally unreliable.Finally, their free support is limited to 90 days. In other words, if you have a problem after that time, even if it's a problem with the router, you have to pay!"
2,Unrealiable - tech support a hassle,"Judging by the other user comments, I guess some people are lucky and don't have a problem with this router. I am not one of them. It worked great when it actually worked properly, but I found the proformance to be inconsistent and the router often dropped packets. Their tech help is in India so you have to wait about an hour to get through and then the help, although friendly, was difficult to understand. I ended up calling three times and finally felt I had wasted enough time on the phone with them and sent it back for a refund. Life is to short to spend holding on the phone. I can not recommend this product if you need a reliable connection. I guess if you are not online too much then it will suffice, but if you work from home and absolutely need it to work everytime, don't count on it."
1,terrible router,"Terrible router. Very unstable, sometimes it works, but after one n ight, it will stop working and you have to reset everything to get it work again. Also, it slows down the internet speed a lot. Very disappointed with it and will buy one from some other manufacturer next time."
3,Does not work with Dell's TrueMobile 1300 Mini-PCI Card,"I got a Dell laptop a month ago with the TrueMobile 1300 Mini-PCI card to work with this router. After trouble shooting with their technical support for three weeks, they told me there is a known issue with this configuration and a fix is expect to come out in August 2003. I tried to return the laptop and they told me I am one day over the 30-day return policy. If their technical support would have told me earlier that it was an issue, I could have returned it earlier... So if you are shopping for a router to work with Dell TrueMobile 1300, don't buy this one. It will only give you tons of frustration with Dell's technical support."
4,"painless installation, no problems",i installed the mr814 in my apartment without any difficulties. paired with ma401 wireless pc card - excellent signal quality.
1,Piece of crap - Netgear will charge you to return,"Bought this router less than 2 months ago and started having DNS problems (no internet). It was due to heat, the router chips get too hot and starts failing. I called netgear and they know about this issue and gave me an RMA right away. Now they want to charge me $15 to cross ship the product, no way I said. I will wait until it burns itself out then return it. This product was badly designed and a lot of people are having the same probelms. If netgear cared about thier customers they should replace it free of charge."
2,Dont be surprised if it drops your connections regularly,"I bought this because it was super cheap and I needed one. I'm starting to regret that. It drops wired connections AND wireless connections all the time. It assigns incorrect IP addresses and made WEP enabling VERY difficult (mainly because the computer and router weren't communicating the new key). The only positive thing from this experience was Amazon's willingness to bend over backwards to get me a replacement. They'll treat you right, but you may want to look at another product."
1,"Ended badly: I got what I paid for, I guess","Yep: it's dead. I can't even get to it to reload the firmware. It's a shame: it's a nice design, much more compact than the Linksys WRT54G I'm gonna get instead."
2,Only works for 2 months,"I bought this wireless router 2 months ago. In the beginning,it worked fine. However, after around 2 months passed, itstart to drop my laptop from wireless network every 5 to 10minutes. After the similar situation appeared several times,you will find the wireless network indicator light doesn'tflash anymore. At the time, you need to reboot this router againto make it work for a short time. Then repeat the similiar steps,every several hours. :(I give it 2 stars because I use it as an expensive hub now. :Q"
2,Printer & File sharing,Broadband sharing is excellent and it did not take more than a minute to get going. The router was also bought so we could share the color printer and the laser printer attached locally on two separate computers(One upstairs and other downstairs) I could print only once from the downstairs computers to the upstairs computer. But after the boot up next day I am losing the connectivity. I have tried to assign static IP addresses to the computer - but no luck. And when I ask Netgear for support -- they say I have to pay per incident charges!!! their CS really [is bad]!!!
1,Chokes on heavy UDP traffic,"I've bought alot of Netgear products in the past, but this is by far the most unreliable piece of network equipment I have ever used (and I work in networking). If you do anything that generates a large number of packets, this router probably won't cope. The router gets overloaded and stops routing any time I send heavy UDP traffic through it over my 1.5Mbit ADSL WAN.Services especially likely to trigger this are UDP-based services such as some file sharing services (like Overnet) or game servers (like Half-Life/Counter-strike).I have applied the latest firmware from Netgear to no avail."
1,Mail-in Rebate from Netgear is a joke,I bought this router and the MA521 card in September. The router and the card worked fine. But I still have not received the promised the mail-in rebate more than 3 months later.
4,Easy to install and very secure!,"So far, so good. I've only had it for four days. I couldn't pass up the deal with the $40 rebate.My main goal was to secure my home computers from my cable internet connection. This router did the trick!It was easy to install and configure. After it was connected, I went to broadbandreports.com and ran a security test. I received a PERFECT SCORE! Passing their test is pretty impressive.The combination of ethernet and wireless is awesome! I can bring a laptop home from work and have internet access without wires."
3,"Good overall, but connection lost from time to time","I bought this wireless router a couple of months ago, the setup is pretty easy and it is smaller than I thought and I actually like the style. However, the wireless connection is lost from time to time and the interval is anywhere between 1 hour and 1 day. Everytime this happens, I have to unplug the adaptor and restart again. BTW, the rebate provdided by NETGEAR is very unreliable."
2,"Warning: Not the real book, just a commentary","I thought this was the real Great Gatsby book with additional commentary, but it is primarily a commentary with little of the original text.This version does not include the complete text of the book like some of the other editions do.The commentary is okay, but not as helpful as some other study guides."
1,YOU'RE GONNA BE VERY DISAPPOINTED!!,"OKAY HERE IS THE TRUTH ABOUT THE ZEN MICRO:(What Creative doesn't want you to know)1)Battery life, you'll get your 12 hours if you only have about 10 songs on in. The battery life DRAMATICLY DECREASES upon usage. I only had about 400 songs (around 1gb) and an overnight charge gets me about 1 hour of music.2)It's gonna crash, and Creative have the worse tech support.3)Did I mention,Terrible battery life!Other than that it's cute,has FM radio and doubles as a flash drive, but again your only gonna get about 2 months out of it, so does that matter!(Oh yeah and tech support doesn't care!)So if you are looking for a TEMPORARY mp3 player, go with the Micro. Only if u need it for about umm 2 MONTHS then it's dead!Please shop around, maybe the Ipod isn't as bad as we think it is....."
4,Great MP3 Player!!!,"Just bought my new MP3 player yesterday and I absolutely love it. I had an iPod and gave it to my daughter to use while she works out. She can keep it, I love the functionality of this player. A little tricky at first because of the sensitivity setting, but I set mine to low and no problems. The only other thing I would change is the menu setup. It took me a minute to figure out how to get the music library to show up on the menu and the owner's manual wasn't any help. Maybe I'm just slow like that! Overall, I'm more than pleased with the unit and I'll continue to let me daughter think she's gotten over on me..."
5,Zen Micro Is still one of the most versital players,"I have Had many MP3 players but always go back to my Zen Micro. I am using a 6gb that I purchased on ebay for a song. It had a bad headphone jack. I figured out how to fix the headphone jack problem, so now it looks and works like new. I realy like that you can remove the battery from it. All the curent models of mp3 players out there have perminit batterys, so when the battery goes dead the player is dumpster food. I also keep a charged extra battery in the its case. I listen to audio books and the Micro has a bookmark. so you can mark your place. I do wish that the text readout was a little bigger my eyes arn't as good as they use to be, so I have to put reading glasses on to see what's on my player. I think that the Micro is a well desinged and built player."
2,Broke apart after one day in the pond...,Worked okay for a few hours then the filter holder broke off. I glued it back on and it works now but certainly not a good design.
3,there's another one,"Hustler's Wife is set in Richmond and after reading B-More Careful I was curious to see if Nikki Turner could do with the bad side of Richmond what Shannon Holmes did with the hard knock side of Baltimore.First, let's be honest. This is a fairy tale. A girl's version of a street novel. It sugar coats the drug dealing lifestyle and portrays low down streetwalkers and ignorant high schoolers as heroines. If that's what you want in a book this ones dishes it up. I found it distasteful. Also, the book needed an editor. If you're going to ask me to part with my money the least you can do is come correct."
1,Wrong Name,"I did not enjoy this book. First, there were too many grammatical errors. The title as well as the cover was an eye catcher, but the title doesn't support the book. She was neverhis wife, unless you bring in the topic of common-law. Secondly, what mother would let her child go through so much when there was proof from the beginning to clear her name. Not a real mother!!!!"
1,A total disappointment,"The characters in this book were more like super characters (they could & would do anything). The Mother was suppose to be moral but in the end did something so out of character it was unbelievable. The main character's decisions were poor considering the author wanted you to believe she was young and smart. Also, the editing of the book was horrible. Missed spelled words and poor sentence structure. Save your money."
4,GOOD READ,THIS BOOK IS NOT WHAT YOU THINK IT IS. I HAD SOMETHING TOTALLY DIFFERENT IN MIND WHEN I BOUGHT IT. I'M GLAD I DID. IT WAS A GOOD BOOK THAT HELD MY ATTENTION TILL THE END. AND IS THAT NOT WHAT WE ALL WANT. BOOKS ARE SUPPOSED TO TAKE YOU TO A BIT OF FANTASY LIFE AND THAT IS WHAT NIKKI TURNER DID. I READ SOME OF THE REVIEWS AND WAS QUITE DISSAPPOINTED AT HOW MANY PEOPLE SAID IT WAS NOT REALISTIC. GUESS WHAT?? IT'S FICTION. JUST ENTERTAINMENT. GOOD JOB NIKKI. I CAN'T WAIT TO READ PART 2.
2,Part two's comming soon! Please be better than this one,"I Love Nikki Turner's writting style and have enjoyed her books...this was the weakest I have read so far. Don't get me wrong I enjoyed it and will be reading part2 to see how things end and all but, uh...let's just say if I would have read this book first? I probally wouldn't of read anything else from her unless it really caught my eye. Not a must read but a ok read for true Nikki Turner fans."
5,A book that every wife should read,"I can really relate to the book being in almost same position Yarni was in. I felt like I was really reading my life story. It made me laugh and even cry. I really have to hand it to you Nikki thanks for writing a book for us "" hustler's wife"" can relate to. The struggle of every day to day basis dealing with life different turns makes you really want to get of the game. Congrats on an excellent book! Have fun reading it."
1,NOT....,"This was one of the worst books I have read in a long time. I am so tired of reading books with typos, incomplete sentences, storylines that don't go anywhere, and, completely unbelieveable situations.The only reason I finished the book was because I started it. But it was a chore to do so.It seems to me the only people who like these books and give them 4 and 5 stars, are people who seem to have problems writing and spelling themselves. If you don't believe me, read their reviews, and you will understand what I mean."
3,"""Glamorous life...""","The glamorous life of money, cars, designer clothes and envy was the sell of being with a hustler. The intrigue of danger and outside the lines living, brings a dark side that is such a heavy price to pay. Taylor brings the street life to your reading room with complex characters and true grit drama.This story of survival is happening in every city USA, the reader should be careful not to assume otherwise.Reviewer: VRS"
4,That's whats up,"I really liked this book first because its about where I live,and second because it kept me interested page after page. I have known people that the characters in this book remind me of. I feel like the author really really brings it home with this book. I will read any other books comming from her. Much luv in the 804."
2,Not what it's Hyped up to be,"I read this book because it eas eye cathcing,I read the back of the book and it sounded good, and most of the reviews I saw on here were good. This book was ok because it shows how some bad things can happen and it still kinda gave a good message, but this book is unreallistic. What mother would let some 21 year old man take her 15 year old daughter and move him in with her without trying to press charges? It was kind of a fairy tale. If I could give this book 2 1/5 stars then I would. It had a hand full of grammical errors and last but not least, the book was a little boring. but overall the book was ok."
4,True to the game.,"This book was so real. It was real in the aspect of betrayal and deceit. Yarny experiened so much pain from men that it was true to the game. Men in that game beleive that if you don't ""Roll with them they will Roll right over you"", such is life. But just like any BLACK woman we always bounce back like RUBBERBANDS and that is exactly what Yarny did."
2,"A bootleg version of ""Coldest Winter Ever""","A Hustler's Wife: The title of this book immediately drew me to wanting to read the book. I love to see Black authors trying to get on their feet and get the recognition everyone wants, however, I think people need to be unique in their writing styles and stories. Although this book started off slow and childish, it begame an okay read I thought. To witness the struggles Yarni and her close friends and family went through and overcame was a joy. I loved to see her turn herself to God in the end. I think most of us get carried away in situations and forget to thank He who brings us through everything. The love story between her and Des was real and it shows that even though a woman might do her thing while her man is on the inside, she's always thinking of him first. Overall it was just a bootleg version of ""The Coldest Winter Ever"""
5,Loved It,"I received this book yesterday in the mail and began reading after work,I am writing this at 10am the next day and I loved the book. I finished it in less than 24 hours.It was such a quick read and it was so well written. Ms. Turner did a fine job with her debut, I can't wait to recieve her next work in the mail. This kept me up all night and i loved every word of it. Thank you for such a good read."
4,Quick Read,"I enjoyed A Hustler's Wife. It was a quick read and a definite page-turner. I felt like I knew the characters.The only problem I had w/the book were the numerous errors throughout the book. Please allow SEVERAL people to proof/edit your book before sending it to the publisher. As an english teacher, this is a pet peeve of mine.I am looking forward to reading your next book!"
3,Gritty Urban Drama,Unfortunately this is how some women live and Nikki did a grat job of bringing the story to life. If you ever wondered how can they do that? Then this is the book for you.
2,Typing errors make me crazy!,"This book had it's good moments, but the typing errors and the ""mystery"" characters made it a difficult read. The God child and the god childs mother, where did they come from?. The ending was horrible. Who was Rico??? Very poor planning on the writers part. The ending wrapped up too perfectly. Which we all know is nothing like life on the streets!"
4,"Heres 2 you, NIkki!!!","I loved it, I was unable to put it down. I was late for work because I was too into Yarni to check the clock. I don't get into too many books. I don't relate well to made up ish, but this, I could relate to the fullest. I loved the bond between Yarni and her family and of course Des. To the haters ...she did ""hustle"" to get hers. She didnt sell herself for materials she earned them by doing -what a girl had to do-. I ordered your newest book, I am looking forward to it. Yeah, I will agree there were typos, but damn... I think we all errors. You go girl...go for yours. And good luck with your future."
4,AI'IGHT,"A HUSTLER'S WIFE WAS OVER ALL A PRETTY GOOD BOOK...THE AUTHUR REALLY SHOWED SOME OF THE DRAMA A GIRL MUST GO THRU SOMETIMES IN ORDER TO KEEP HER LIFE TOGETHER. TURNER ALSO VIVIDLY DESCRIBES THE INTENSE LOVE THE MAIN CHARACTER,YARNI HAD FOR HER ONE TRUE LOVE, DES. EVEN HIM BEING TAKEN AWAY FROM HER FOR YEARS DIDN'T DARE SHAKE OR STIR THE BOND THAT WAS SET BETWEEN THEM. WITH OTHER GUYS YARNI WAS PUT THRU BABY MOMMA DRAMA, JAIL TIME, AND HER VERY LIFE WAS PUT ON THE LINE...SHE COULDN'T EVEN DEPEND ON THE GIRL FRIENDS SHE HAD BECAUSE FOR SOME REASON OR ANOTHER THEY ALWAYS ENDED UP DOING HER HARM INSTEAD OF HELPING. IN THE END WITH SUPORT FROM HER MOM, YARNI ENDED UP BEING AN EXAMPLE TO ALL WOMEN... SHE WAS DEDICATED, CAREING AND SELF RELIANT...I KNEW FOR A FACT AT THE END OF THE BOOK THAT YARNI WAS GOING TO BE A GREAT WIFE TO DES AFTER ALL SHE'D BEEN THRU WITH OUT HIM."
1,You'll pay more for shipping than for the merchandise itself!,"$1.98 seems like a great deal, right? I was interested in purchasing this product in order to create ""goody bags"" using iron-on transfers (for an event I am planning). I needed 15 bags and went about the process of purchasing them only to find that the shipping costs far exceed the cost of the merchandise! No, thank you! I'm better off purchasing canvas bags for 2.98 apiece at a craft store!"
4,"Very thought-provoking, strong characters","The novel is essentially a detailed character, cultural and behavioural study which happens to explore some rather intriguing and potentially divisive issues. If you can read with an open mind, you'll see that this book is most definitely neither mean-spirited _nor_ mocking or derisive of religion. It's a book that attempts to challenge and encourage it's readership to think - if you start reading expecting to be shocked by it's blasphemous content, well, you've prejudged and will doubtless find such a message."
1,As dry as the landscape it depicts,"I enjoy intelligent, philosophical writing, which is why I was eager to read this novel. But I found the writing to be as arid as the desert landscape it describes. I forced my way through it, hoping for something allegorical or thought-provoking. The characters were well-differentiated but shallow, and the entire thing read as if it had been outlined and then filled in. I wasn't bothered by the lack of plot, but I finished the book wondering what was the point of it all?"
2,Eddie Bauer V10 Mini Triplex E-Light,"Nice size light,and stailess is nice,but its outdated leds are weak and tinted bluish.The threads are rough,so it doesnt turn on/off easy.The single led version of this light is much brighter and whiter.Still rough threas,no amount of grease seems to smooth it out,I still need 2 hands to turn it on/off. To bad as its a handome looking light,also runs on AAAA battery,not as common to find,It does offer a long runtime.I feel better choices for the money."
3,I have no idea which set this is,"Is this the newly released 4 cd set with the New York and a few from the Columbia?I have no idea which set this is.I see some are selling at $8, others at $50. I suspect there is a mixup somewhere here. Can all sellers please provide details of their listings.Also we need a photo and more product details.If this is the Walter/Columbia Last 6 sym set, then I rate it 5 Stars and is worth $50. But if its the set with the New York in syms 40 and 41, its only worth $8 and I rate it 2 stars.Any help here is greatly appreciated.see my comments on the Mozart/Walter sym set above.Paul"
5,Gene Pitney - what a classic performer,"There are songs on this CD which I don't remember ever hearing before. A new favorite is ""Yours Until Tomorrow,"" written by Carole King/Gerry Goffin. I so regret not being able to see Gene Pitney in a live performance before he died several years ago. What a fantastic voice he had. This CD is quite wonderful, and has 25 tracks on it - a long one!"
5,Almost all there,"I owned several Gene Pitney 45s during the 1960s and gave them away when I left town to pursue higher education. 25 All-time greatest hits replaces those vinyls and adds most of those that came out after I left.But missing is Donna Means Heartbreak. For some reason, this song is rarely available. I may have seen it listed on only one on several Pitney CDs. I don't know if there is a copyright problem here, but I hope to be able to hear it again someday. I still give the CD 5 stars, although with that missing piece it should probably be 4.75."
5,Great deal,"you can not go wrong with this CD player I got it for my garage and it works great. it is not real fency but it sure does a great job and the shipping was fast, and the seller is great if anything is wrong. GREAT DEAL!!"
2,Stock on Fuji: Not good,"Never broke a spoke on a bike, ever.... until I got a set of these Weinmanns stock on my Fuji Absolute. Wheel went out of round within 200 miles.... broken spoke. Got them professionally fixed and trued. 200 miles later.... broken spoke, then another, then two more. Once one goes, the other ones go in quick succession... it was a matter of seconds. I'm 210 on 700c's. That shouldn't me too much to ask of them. I do crank up a lot of steep hills, but all on pavement. The wheel is so out of round now that it can't be totally re-trued, this from a professional bike shop. Either bum spokes, bum construction, or bum hubs, but something about these wheels doesn't agree with Fuji hybrid road bikes. I've read other reviews of the Weinmann equipped Fujis and there are a larger than normal ratio of complaints about broken spokes. I'm trading up to Mavics recommended to me by a pro bike mechanic."
1,Nothing but Problems,I was initially pleased with the laptop but after a while I started having problems.The wireless network adapter failed because of a bios problem that has now been patched but required a trip back to HP.It often hangs during shutdowns and Windows Explorer will hang during normal operation. I don't run anything out of the ordinary.There is nothing in the event log to point to the instability and tech support has been useless. All they did was have me send it to them and they re-imaged it after I had just done that not long before. I even had problems with nothing but the original HP image and no added software other than Firefox installed.Vista is such a resource hog that 1 gig of memory is really not enough. If you run more than one application performance slows. I am considering going back to XP because I think many of my problems will disappear.
5,Another tremendous album by Lucy,"This one has it all--great, personal lyrics (Just You Tonight will have you running for the kleenex), well-written songs and playing. The title track is a real keeper, as is the cover of Steve Earle's Somewhere Out There.A great album, sure to be in my CD player for years."
4,Red Dot Sight on CO2 Pellet Pistol,"Product is high quality and functions as advertised for a very reasonable price. I adapted it to a CO2 pellet pistol, greatly improving accuracy and repeatability. Batteries are a bit expensive, and one has to be careful to shut the sight off between uses to extend battery life as much as possible. Plan to buy another."
2,No dot appearing,"no dot appearing when I turn the sight on. says it has a long lasting battery, im assuming its because it doesn't even turn on?"
1,no light--no dot--no nothing--period,"Received mine today--excited as a kid to mount the unit on my 1377; unfortunately, the sight doesn't work--at all. There's a 3-position switch: 'dark,' 'dark,' and...'dark.' How very disappointing. At least I can use the 459MT on another project, so it's just $10 down the crapper instead of $20. May your luck be better. Peace."
4,"Good collection of early Muddy, but....","...but, well, the Complete Blues label, which issues this new series of digipacks featuring artists like Muddy Waters, Elmore James, Leroy Carr and many more, is taking advantage of certain European copyright laws, so the morality of buying from them is dubious. The Muddy Waters CDs from MCA-Universal (the successor to the Chess label) generate royalties to Muddy's family, and also tend to be more coherent thematically, so I'd go for one of their excellent Muddy-compilations instead.Anyway...this is a collection of Muddy Waters' earliest sides, a couple of them non-commercial recordings made at Stovall's Plantation in the early 1940's. There are some genuine classics here, like ""Gypsy Woman"", ""I Can't Be Satisfied"", ""Train Fare Home"", and ""Rollin' Stone"", and the mastering is generally excellent.Yadayadayada. I still think you should buy the MCA/Chess-albums."
3,It has a twist,"This is a book about a group of gay and lesbian friends who decide to retire and buy houses near each other in an exclusive Florida community. You get a chance to see how older members of the ""family"" adjust to living together and to trying to mix in with the rest of the neighborhood. There is a twist ending to one of the relationships that lingers with you. This just isn't what you expected to happen. It's hard to get into the book though because there isn't a lot to relate to in the characters. A longer book might have done the story more justice."
3,"Great Reference, Difficult to Follow","I had to use this book for my Language Learning Teaching class and there were parts of the book that really helped me out in better understanding English grammar. However, this book is very complex and difficult to follow. Everything is really dense and the material seems harder that what it really is. Without the guidance of my professor I would of for sure been lost trying to read and comprehend all the material."
3,Longman Student Grammar of Spoken and Written English,"Most of them explain clearly, but some parts are more complex to understand. There are many examples in the book, sometimes I confus a lot because looks similar. Overall, the book is good to read because you can get more knowledge that you do not know it before."
4,Thorough but imperfect,"This is a textbook used in my junior level grammar class at university.The text is very thorough and dense. Odds are, you'll get more from this text than you'll ever need. Just keep a highlighter at hand and you'll do great reading through it. If you get the workbook companion to this, everything will click quite well.The only issue is that it has a few errors in it that are a bit frustrating. The most blatant issue with it is that it includes a section on ""Verbless Clauses."" If you're unfamiliar with grammar, let me explain why that's ridiculous: CLAUSES MUST--I REPEAT, MUST--HAVE VERBS. There are NO exceptions. Our professor simply instructed us to ignore that section.Otherwise, it's a great textbook that includes quite a bit more than most books. Better it be too thorough than not thorough enough!"
4,Would have given it 5 stars but for my mistake.,"As usual, I always think bigger is better. I should know better by now, but! This travel case is one of the finest cases I have ever owned, and I have used the best in my long life. I ordered this specifically for a three day trip to my daughters wedding. I took the train as it it is easier for a handicapped person. When the porter helped me on the train he even commented on the good looks and ease of use of the pull out handle. The wheels worked great and never once tilted or tried to flip over. Loaded with exterior and interior features, it was a pleasure to use. In New York it took a lot of abuse but not one mark appeared on the material they use in production of this case.I am very, very happy with the purchase and I would reccomend it for those who travel for longer periods of time, for those of us just traveling for a two or three day weekend, look at the smaller size."
5,If this is the direction these guys are going...,"Then I am going to be one little obsessed Dredg fan.This album has everything....techno beats...orchestras..rock tunes..has it all.When I get some money,This cd is MINE!This is very different I think from their first cd,it shows a broader aspect than just rock.If u like this album..then I would suggest checking out Diorama by Silverchair...it is very good as well."
3,Great music - but a lot of B.S. tracks,"Don't be mislead by the 3 stars I gave this album. The music is amazing. Like other reviews say, it's truly awesome art rock. I just felt the need to write a review to warn other listeners that there are a lot of tracks on this album that aren't songs. All of the brushstrokes and a few other tracks are too weird to be considered songs. They're more or less just soundscapes. They're still good to listen to sometimes, but I wouldn't consider them songs. However, the actual songs on the album are phenomenal. A great addition to any Dredg fan's collection."
5,Unbelieveable,"Amazing. Nothing short of that word would do this album justice. I've had Leitmotif since 1999, and picked this album up the day it hit the stores. To put it simple: just do yourself a favor and pick this album up, or at least give it a listen one way or another, as you won't be dissapointed. I had extreme expectations for this follow-up to Leitmotif, which is (or rather, was) probably my favorite album, and El Cielo blew them away. Recommendations don't come much higher than that."
4,Different,"WOW they really progress from album to album. To compare this album to the first is hard to do. Kinda like comparing apples to oranges as the cliche goes. Comparisons aside, this is a must have album for anybody bored and sickened with the standard mold of many modern rock bands. I find myself looking harder for more and more art rock because that is where it's at. This album features very good instrumentals to compliment the smooth vocals. I like the whole concept of the lyrics and how they're taken from journal entries. It adds to the depth. Once again this is a must have."
2,"Humor based on the ignorant southerner, the time for this type of humor has passed","This is a pamphlet book where I am unsure as to what the target audience and purpose is. It is supposedly written by an uneducated southern man with no sophistication and little knowledge of spelling and grammar. Phrases like ""sed"", ""sez"", ""air"", ""shore tuh"", ""ovah"", ""whar"" and ""et"" are frequently used. Since it was written by a southern man, it would appear that it is a parody, but it is decidedly unflattering to people of the south. My best description is that it is a book where if it had been written by a Yankee, the verbiage would be considered ""fighting words"", so it could only be written and published by a true man of the south.If you like silly humor based on the ridicule of a segment of the population, you might enjoy this book. However, in my opinion, humor based on the cliché of the ignorant southerner passed into history some time ago and the world is better for it."
1,Spam software,"This is a spam software. It's good for the people that Amazon carries this, so that they can read the reviews before they fall in the same trick. However, Amazon will get sued one day or another because of selling spam. The software itself is cheap, but all the cost to have a professional come out and fix customer's computer is not. Be aware!When it installs the 'ringtone maker', it also installs its 'MAGIX manager' secretly. There's no easy to to quit from the 'manager'. You can't uninstall from the control panel either, because it stays in the system all the time. When you close the 'Magix manger' windows, it pops up another window, which does not even have a 'close' or 'quit' button.1 Star is the lowest possible here, I wish I could do negative. Whoever made this software should be put into the jail."
1,Warning before buying this product,One thing they do not mention is that your wireless phone must have infared or have bluetooth. I did not know this and must now return the product. Make sure your cell is compatible before ordering.
1,Not compatible with many phones,"I could not tell from the product description that this would not work with my daughers phone. Waste of $20. This product needs to have a very clear description of supported phones on it. You cant tell until you install which then invalidates the returns policy for the software. Very poor.When buying, it was not clear that this was being delivered by another merchant with different return policy. Now the returns process is a pain. I wanted to buy all my Christmas gifts early from Amazon, not some other vendor because I want their return policies. Amazon need to make it much clearer that you are leaving their web site when you do so. Unless you look carefully it all looks like Amazon branded until the package arrives. Amazon should deal with returns when its them that take the money. I have used Amazon and been very happy for years but this has been the first bad experience. Now I'll think twice about where to buy."
3,Good but not GREAT!,"There are plenty of great songs from Jackson Browne to compile a ""greatest hits"" cd. There, however, are only a couple of them included in this compilation. This cd is good....but not at all what I was expecting from something titled ""The best of Jackson Browne""!"
3,"Someone's choice for ""best of"", but not the right one","There are enough good Jackson Browne tracks to EASILY fill a single (or double) CD best of. So why is this compilation so lame? First off, it takes the questionable approach of including no more than one track per album. That means the classic era albums (through The Pretender) get shortchanged, while later efforts are overemphasized. The one track chosen for each album is also suspect in several cases. On the upside, the mostly unheard and/or previously unreleased material that comes at the end of this CD is suprisingly strong. In fact, much stronger than some of the hits from the post-Pretender era. This is material that deserves to more widely heard. But this compilation serves neither that material, nor Browne's true best-of properly.dap"
3,Greatest hits you've never heard of!,"Okay, Mr. Browne, we'll concede that you're a pretty talented guy, and we know that, like any serious musician, you are capable of better stuff than the tunes that get the airplay might suggest.We also know that if it weren't for us, your adoring public, you'd be crooning for free fries at the local Tastee-Freeze. And although some of your enduring fans are enamored of your more ""artistic"" efforts, it's obviously fair to say that the pop stuff made you who you are.With that fact in mind, this CD, which of course includes many fine songs we all know and love, is a bit of a self-indulgent effort -- and a real ""up yours"" to fans who've waited years for a compilation of your real hits. A ""greatest hits"" release which excludes so many true hits in favor of little-known B-side cuts is more than a little weak! Perhaps this is an effort to save a few for a second greatest hits volume. Some advice: Don't bother, you're not THAT good."
3,Jackson Browne out,"Well, I like the selections on this greatest hits offering, however, I think it comes up a little short. After all, where's any representations from his album ""Hold out""? What about ""that girl could sing""? ""boulevard""? those were decent hits for Browne and they are omitted from this greatest hits cd. I dont want to spoil the love fest for Jackson, but come on, ""Running on empty"" wasnt his only good album"
5,Great,"I make duct tape products, and this works GREAT for ID plastic. They are extremely durable and VERY thick. That are a little hard to open, so if you are buying them to hold cards, it may be a bit hard to get the card in, but other than that, these are really well made and i definitely recommend this item."
4,Be lost without it!,"Full of the latest prices, hottest places to go for the new century. A travel guide that helped me see all that I wanted to see without getting lost. A must have for European travel!"
2,Outdated information,"Much of the information in this book, including telephone numbers, prices and maps, are outdated."
4,Great thriller!,In Silence is the 2nd Erica Spindler book I've read. This book was so good I had a difficult time putting it down.The ending was a complete surprise to me! Avery Chauvin is a tenacious young woman who doesn't believe her father took his own life. The big city journalist returns to her small town birth place to end up imbroiled in multiple murders and caught between two brothers. As people are being brutally murdered all around her she manages to piece together a insidious plot in her sleepy home town. Who should she trust? This is a must read book!
5,"creative,refreshing, cohesive,and inventive",Very tight knit group. It sounds like these guys really rehearsed the material. Interesting concept
1,i ride 3 wheeler charge bunk mouth,look to nice ate all my yum. i will be first i will be first on sunday! send to little houses my name in snow balls toodle to yuk my name! lice will tickle but i wet my coffin. so sorry. a little small tiger is a goose to lick eat dinner. merry christmas. you are santa claus.
2,Bags,"If i were buying another bag for one of my sons i would still go with the standard bag. size plus the dividers is just nice. if you have enough discs to fill this bag wouldn't be to bad, but the standard bag will also hold a 32 oz gator aid."
5,Concise,"It's concise, easy to read, and has great citations. I hate reading books that have obvious political bias and this avoids it. At times I think the guy is a liberal and other times I think he's a conservative. Most of the time I think he's an unbiased observer. Enjoy!"
4,Boards From Hell: Maps for Getting Home from There,"This book is a must read for volunteer board members and the staff who nurture them while trying to do their underpaid, undervalued jobs.Boards from Hell is an easy read, reference manual that gives names to the dismay you're feeling when attempting to make your non-profit board productive and mission-driven. It also gives easy to follow, realistic steps to take to rescue faltering boards and put them back on the road to governance rather than abstinence or micro-management.I use this book with struggling boards and with college students interested in ""getting it right."" In fact, this order represents my 60-something purchase of the book!"
4,I Love this bag,"I love this bag, it is my addiction, front and center. It helps me not to drink it, coke, which is weird, becasue coca-cola didn't sell it to me, it's like nicorette, and you wouldn't think they'd let their logo be lisenced if it was gonna help me break free of their hold. Every time I think I might want to have some beyond what I've allowed myself, beyond my 36 ounces, I look at it and it does everything coke made it to do. Red silver, it makes me think of drinking it, it makes the roof of my mouth feel fizzy and cold and not sweet but not not sweet, just cold refreshing that opens out into my throat, and now just looking at the red swirl and fake bubbles, just looking under my arm makes my brain feel fizzy and fresh all over, like shaken a little, and colder ande cleaner.I love this bag. But four stars because it's hard to see it up under my arm like that. I wish the strap were longer."
5,Flutophone,I saw this item and thought it would be perfect for my child. She loves it. She did not have much experience with musical instruments so this was perfect for her. It is great for small hands and mouths. It is super cute and fun. It is high quality. This is perfect for any child who wants a musical instrument and is just beginning.
3,Check out book in bookstore before you buy.,"From all the great reviews I was looking forward to buying this book. I checked it out at the book store and found it to be a rather slim book. Not a whole lot of content. Many short sections and not a lot of depth. If you know something about photography, this book may be a lot of repeat basic information. Nothing groundbreaking and not a lot of meat to any subject. If you're like me, you'll read through it once in an hour then never pick it up again."
3,Take Me Out to the Ballgame,"I was disappointed to discover that this was an older edition and not the new one, which I have purchased for others. It lacks the updates of the currebt edition. I suppose its one way to get rid of old merchandise."
2,AGAIN its BROKEN,this is the second time i will have had to have my wheel replaced in 6 monthsfirst it was the left paddle shift & now it will not center correctly......the build of this wheel is SHOCKINGLogitech do you build anything with quality anymore...+ it took me 6 weeks to get a replacement last timeby the time you replace this one my warranty will almost be up & i will be asking for a fresh warranty to cover my wheel.i just do not trust it will last out a year....
4,Nice wheel for the price,"I bought this wheel for Toca Race Driver 3 and it works great! It was a plug and play situation with my macbook pro. The pedals have good response but no clutch pedal. However, for the money the wheel and pedals are worth it."
3,"Good wheel, horrible attachment to desk","Overall, this wheel is pretty good. I like the seperate stick shift, shift padels, and gas/break. The amount of buttons allow for a wide variety of setup options for games such as the NFS series.However... the way you clamp this thing to the desk is just plain stupid. Look at the pictures and you'll see. They should have looked at the old Microsoft force feedback wheel of older days - now that was a real clamping system. There's nothing more irritating then when you're enjoying a great driving game and the wheel slips because of such a poor design. If it hadn't been for that, this wheel would be 4, or even 5, stars. Grrr - if Logitech would just redesign their ""clamping"" system!"
2,Misleading,The ginseng is much smaller than what you would expect since it looks so good on pictures. Would you call this premium after all????
4,Odds and Ends,"The 1989 EP A Rose By Any Other Name serves as a brief overview/rarities collection of early L.A. metal band B_tch and their fierce frontwoman Betsy Weiss. B_tch was one of the earliest of the Metal Blade bands, and their mix of fast and furious heavy metal with S&M; subject matter definitely made people take notice!The EP contains remixes of B_tch songs Make It Real and Skullcrusher, as well as the song Sunset Strut from the Betsy album and Walls of Love, which was intended for a new Betsy project. There are two more previously unreleased songs - Throw Me In and Crash the Party, Smash the Cake - rounding out the collection.A Rose By Any Other Name is a must-have for B_tch fans, and is a nice (and inexpensive) way for those who are curious to see what B_tch's sound was all about. Fair warning though - don't go in expecting to hear something like Lita Ford or Vixen."
2,Triple Crown Publishing Should Be Ashamed,"Money talks and bull---- walks. That's Triple Crown's Motto. I agree with most of the readers that we should boycott Triple Crown Publishing until they provide us with some quality editing. Instead read Sister Souljah (Coldest Winter), Weber (Player Haters), Zane (Nervous), Rolyat (Lust), Dickey (Other Woman). Now these are quality, pageturning stories with sound editing.Souljah is STILL the reigning Queen of Hip Hop! She never gave birth or passed her baton to another so there is no princess of hip hop! (Not yet anyway)."
3,Hmmmm..........,I thought it was a pretty good book but like some of the others pointed out...there were way too many typos and errors. I wasn't sure if it was deliberate or she had a terrible editor. Loved the concept but it was seriously dummed down. I'm looking to pick up Hustler's Wife pretty soon.
4,Loved It,I enjoyed this book just as much as the first one. The small errors that I found in the book were not enough to turn me off from reading it. It was true to life cause pg 2 paragraph 3 everyone knows someone who is like that or has been with someone like that.Nikki you doing the damn thing!
3,THE BOOK WAS A PAGE TURNER,I THOUGHT THE BOOK WAS A GOOD READ I READ HUSTLERS WIFE AND I THOUGHT IT WAS BETTER THAN THAT ONE NIKKI TURNER DID A GOOD JOB ON HER SECOND BOOK I STILL THINK THAT ALL THESE BOOKS TRY TO IMMITATE THE COLDEST WINTER EVER AND SHANNON HOLMES B-MORE CAREFUL. OVER ALL IM GLAD I PURCHASED THE BOOK AND I LIKE HOW THE CHARACTER DIDNT NEED TO DEAL WITH HER BABIES DAD FOR MONEY SHE NEVER SLEPT BACK WITH HIM AFTER SHE LEFT HIM. I THOUGHT THAT SHE COULD OF BEEN A REAL PROJECT CHICK THOUGH. AND SHOWED SOME OF THE SHEISTY MOVES PROJECT CHICKS REALLY MAKES. I WAS HAPPY TO ADD THIS BOOK TO MY COLLECTIONPEACE AND HAPPY READING
3,Well It Was Ok.....I Guess,lets see wen my friend gave meh the book she was sayin that the story line was ok buh nikki turner was writin like she was writin the book for middle school kids....and i agree...i really didnt care for a hustler wife as well to b honest i like A Project Chick a lil betta...the book was ok could've been betta i mean idk...it was alright!!!
5,TO MANY HATERS,"THIS WAS ONE OF THE BEST BOOKS I HAVE READ. I READ A LEAST 4 BOOKS A WEEK AND I AM SURPISE BY SOME OF THE BAD REVIEWS. I AGREE THAT THERE WAS A LOT OF TYPOS AND GRAMMAR ERRORS; BUT PASS THAT ""A PROJECT CHICK"" HAS NICE STORY LINE. I HAVE GAVE MY COPY TO OVER TEN PEOPLE, AND ONLY RECIEVED ONE BAD COMMENT. SHE COULD NOT RELATE TO THE BOOK BECAUSE SHE WAS OLDER AND DID UNDERSTAND THE STRUGGLES OF A PSYCO BOYFRIEND."
2,OK Story Line... Horrible Editing!,"I haven't finished the book; I am only on the first few chapters. But the grammatical and punctuation errors in this book are ridiculous! Just because the book is about the 'hood doesn't mean that the author/editors can write correctly.I'm not speaking about the word choices and language used. I expect that from this type of novel. I'm talking about misplaced and unnecessary commas, run-on sentences, etc. I'm enjoying the story, but trying to decipher what Ms. Turner is saying is giving me quite a headache!"
3,A PROJECT CHICK,THIS BOOK WAS GOOD UNTIL THE ENDING.THE WAY THIS BOOK ENDED LEFT ME MAD BECAUSE I STILL NEVER REALLY FOUND OUT WHAT HAPPEN TO THE LAST PEOPLE STANDING IN THE BOOK/AND I DIDN;T TELL WHAT HAPPEN TO THE EX-CRAZY BOY FRIEND/AND WHY THE BOOK REFER TO HUSTLERS WIFE WONDERING IF THE END OF THE STORY IN HUSTLERS WIFE I GUESS I WILL SEE WHEN I PURCHASE HUSTLERS WIFE
5,A Delight for All Ages,"I'm a paper artist who also happens to be a Hans Christian Andersen fan. I bought the book for myself, although it would be a terrific selection for a child who likes to use scissors and glue or who might be interested in the person behind some of their favorite fairy tales. It's hard to find many printed examples outside of Denmark of Hans Christian Andersen's cut paper work. Beth Wagner Brust is a paper cutter herself and brings this enthusiasm to her book. She has performed a great service for Andersen fans and paper cutters of all ages."
2,dissapointed,"I think this is the best Bible that money can buy however, I am dissapoined with the print. Almost every page I have read so far has letters that are a ""blot"" of ink instead of the letter and words that run into each other without a space. I would not have paid $75.00 for this if I new that in advance."
5,Girlfriend loves it,My girlfriend loves the corset. She looks great wearing it. Perfect gift for valentines day
5,Thought provoking but refreshing,"I found reading this book to be both thought provoking and yet refreshing. It was wonderful to get such different outlooks on the death and dying process and to know that it is nothing to be feared or dreaded in any way. In fact, it is what every soul comes to the earth to experience. A truly life changing book!"
4,Good,"I thought this pack of 50 DVD+R was good, but I would recommend you get the brand Verbatim. Memorex is cheap and reliable, but your best bet would be Verbatim since it's much more reliable and can keep your files and anything you put on it safe and secure."
1,CRAP!!!,"DON'T WASTE YOUR MONEY!!! I have only burned 3 dvd's successfully...out of 8 tried. Don't know what the problem is, but it isn't my burner, as that works with other brands. If you want to save money and get a more reliable product, go for the Amazon DVD's."
1,Many DVDs don't work,"Like other purchasers, I purchased these DVDs thinking that Memorex was a good brand; however, I quickly found that many of the DVDs are dead and will not allow data to be written onto them. That's a waste. I can certainly understand one or two, but at least a third of my 50 DVD pack are useless. I do not recommend buying these."
2,A once great product,"Memorex used to be a brand worth buying, but not now. Lots of write errors, short lasting after burning, just a horrible quality control process. Spend a bit more money and go for a true superior product such as Verbatim DataLife Plus."
4,They will do for now.,little high in price. but did the job. I buy a differant brand. and thought these were light scibe. they weren't.
1,DIE HARD WITH ESTROGEN,"Last year I'd read MORTAL PURSUIT by Brian Harper, who's now writing under the nom de plume Michael Prescott, perhaps a savvy move by his publishers at Signet who wish to distance themselves from the author of the PURSUIT series.The blurb on the book's cover is sexist enough enough as it is- ""For a female cop, the next six hours is all about staying alive."" Why should it matter at all if the cop is a female?The blurb should read, instead, ""For the reader, the next six hours is all about staying awake.""It is preposterous to expect the reader to believe that a cop is going to stay out of radio contact without anyone attempting to look for him/her and the ghost-from-the-past plot device is too hackneyed for words.This may do for a few empty hours at the beach or the laundrymat but I'd recommend going to a second-hand bookstore to pick up this and ""Harper's"" other PURSUIT novels."
2,No insight,"This book is a collection of stories accompanied by a description of each one according to a set structure; backstory, present action, character,tone, dialogue, imagery and description, time management and design. He follows this with Notes, comments on the story.The idea of the book was interesting however, none of the entries taught me anything. He basically states the obvious. I found no insight here."
4,Nice big numbers!,"This is a great game made nicer by having theses extra large numbers. My 89 year old grandmother loves to play but the regular numbers were getting smaller and smaller for her to see so this size number has made it easier for her. The tiles seem easier for her to grasp, too. There is only 2 drawbacks: the blue and green colored tiles are very similar in color and the tile stands are hard to use. The colors should have been farther apart on the color spectrum and they should have used the original tile trays. All in all this is a really good product and I would recommend it for elderly as well as older children."
5,Great Buy & Fun to Play,This is a lot of fun to play. The carrying case is nice. I do wish it came with a bag to put the tiles in.Deluxe Rummikub Large No. Edition
5,George Does It Again!,"I am already the fortunate owner of two of George's workout tapes and this one does not disappoint either. I love the interval training, with short bursts of aerobics. George is his usual positive self, giving the viewer encouraging comments along the way. Petra is marvelous as she leads the viewer through a well constructed workout. For the average everyday individual such as myself, this workout is great especially when you don't have time for a full hour of exercise, but can squeeze in about half that much. It's fun and makes you feel good at the end."
5,Gnosticism- what the Matrix movies primarily were based on!,"Gnosticism is what Jesus taught before Christianity was taken over by the Roman Empire. This book explains who the gods of the old testament were and what Jesus really wanted us to do in life. It is a bit shocking at first, but I enjoy going deeper into the conspiracy of major religions."
2,"Spaced out, this book offers no sound advise on living a spi","I found this book flaked out and spacey....I'm fairly open minded, and do believe there are hidden truths in the Bible, however some of what the author descibes seems like a drugged out space trip. After reading Elaine Pagels synopsis of the secret gospels unearthed at Nag Hammadi, I was Very dissappointed to read such far out un-useful stuff.If I am to understand, Gnostiscm is the path that each person has a direct relationship w/ the creator/divine/all that is. What I read was Panella's interpretation of the Bible. Nothing here to aid someone seeking to persue a spiritual path(never mind a direct relationship w/ a Higher Power) while in an earthly exsistance....I personally believe the secret truth will be revealed when we re-discover for ourselves the feminine face of God and how we as a species are sufferring for lack of it. Read history, mythology, astrology for the great archtypal truths."
4,Wild bird Food,"It really is waste free, which is so important in the garden. It is pretty expensive, not good. I probably would not order again because of the cost."
5,"This Set's a Mess, It's Not Just Hits","Still I love it! Would it have nice to have more of the original clean tracks (hits?!?) compiled in one place? Maybe. But I still get a kick out of every low-fi live track, demo alternate version and whatnot. X was that good of a band in their prime. They tailed of quite a bit after MORE FUN IN THE NEW WORLD, but this set manages to mask that by providing the good stuff and masking some others with superior alternate performances.While X gets lumped in with the LA hardcore scene, they actually had more in common with roots rockers like the Blasters, Los Lobos and the Gun Club. Joe Doe and Exene were salt of the earth poets, John Bonebrake was a powerful drummer and guitarist Billy Zoom was a world class rocker. A great summation of a great band. Get it!!"
5,Adorable!!,I bought this as a Christmas gift for my newborn nephew and he is so cute in it!!! I love it! I would definitely recommend this to anyone looking for a cute sports onesie set!! Go Tigers!!
2,"the first cd is pretty good, cd #2 made a good coaster","the first cd has some tight songs, like heated heavy, world war, war iz on, when i die, thug always, and thug mentality, but cd 2 just straight sux, my best advice to n e one wanting 2 get this cd is just d/l the mp3z, cuz half the album is stupid skits, and get ""i am"" by nas cuz that is one dope album, hopefully layzies solo will be betta than this and the new bone cd coming later this year will be dope"
5,PUT THIS BESIDE YOUR 2PAC AND YOUR DRE'S THE CHRONIC,THIS CD IS VERY GOOD THE SONG WITH SNOOP AND KURUPT SOUNDS LIKE SOMETHING OFF THE OLD CHRONIC CD. ALSO THE SONG WITH FATJOE AND BIGPUN IS THE S-IT AS WELL.I NEVER THOUGHT BONE COULD MAKE A DOUBLE ALBUM THAT I COULD LISTEN TO BOTH CD'S AND LIKE ALL THE SONGS.
5,Good Album,"Krayzie Bone is the most rounded talent musicaly in Bone, it's like his soothing voice and rapid-paced rhymes touch you in a unique, and special way."
3,"decent, but probably not worth the bux spent","cd1 is pretty tight, heated heavy has a phat beat, snoop and kurupt spit dope lyrics in ""the war iz on"", most the trax on the first cd are listenable, except those skits, cd2 on the otherhand sux, i dont think there is one song on it i like, hopefully layzie's solo job and the upcoming bone cd will be alot better, by the way, i bought this along wit nas ""i am"" and nas' cd is 100 times better than this"
3,Warning: Not for all Greatest Generation readers,"I bought this book intending it as a gift for my 90-year-old mother, who loved ""The Greatest Generation"" and ""Duty."" However, once I had a chance to look through it, I know I can't possibly give it to her. She would be so put off by much of the language (liberal use of 4-letter words and casual blasphemy) that she would not be able to see the other values in the book.This criticism in no way represents my own views, but only a caution that this book would not be appropriate for all readers."
2,Great Expectations,"My Husband and I watched this video with great anticipation, thinking it would help provide useful information for our son. It showed parents as they taught their children and the Dr. giving some advice. Basically, let the child progress at their pace and don't push them. Nothing new"
5,women are my weakness and so is poetry,"and jason expresses him superbly in these funny, and sweet poems about love and relationships. several of the poems are short, arranged in 3 line ""stairstep "" stanzas...they are romantic and understated. sublimely beautiful."
5,SATA power cable,"This cable is a really well made with two devices possible per cable. It is fairly short so relies on the existing power connector to provide most of the length. I actually rearranged my devices so that this cable could provide power to two of them that were physically close, leaving a previous cable available for another device."
1,CiTi Electronics is horrible,"I cannot say how this cable works because after 9 days I have not received it or heard anything from them. Even after emailing them 2 days ago I have no idea where my cable is. Be wary of Amazon's guarantee: they tell you to wait until after the vendors shipping estimate has passed, than they tell you to wait 3 more days. In 3 days I'm sure they'll have another excuse! In the mean time my daughters new hard drive sits in a box waiting for a stupid $2 cable. It's funny that a hard drive from a reputable company arrived on the third day but a simple ""drop in an envelope"" cable has taken 10 days and counting.To Amazon:I suggest you use feedback to wean out dead beat companies like CiTi Electronics that are only hurting your reputation. I'm a long time Amazon buyer and this is the first 3rd party vendor that has left me hanging. Please review your guarantee policy for 3rd party vendors and post it as it really is."
4,This CD grew on me,"I believe that there are two bands that have a truly distinct sound and have yet to be imitated. They are My Bloody Valentine and Stereolab. ""Dots and Loops"" took a good two years to grow on me which shouldn't be looked upon as a bad thing because that means that I kept coming back to it and didnt forget about it. I think that serves as a testament to how good this Cd is. It was my first Stereolab album. I dig the mix of French and English. It's interesting to listen to. Just recently I bought ETK and would recommend that one but Dots and ETK are not that similar in my opinion. The overall mood of this album is relaxing and fun. Some of the beats and rythms I find amusing. Overall, I recommend ""Dots and Loops"". It did take a while to grow on me but the important thing is that it DID grow me."
5,At the Heart of the Citizenship Debate,"Whether you agree or disagree w/ Neuman's models of citizenship, his place in immigration law and constitutional theory is solid. He reconstructs the history of immigration, and conducts his questions of citizenship that is bound to pave new ways for thinking about the alien/non-alien split. This is one of my three top books on constitutional theory along w/ Haney-Lopez, White By Law, and Hirsch's A Theory of Liberty. A Classic."
5,As described and on time,The book arrived in terrific condition. I would order from this seller again. This is an unusual Clifford book since it's not a story where Clifford and Emily go somewhere or do something.
1,Myth #26: This is a great investment book,"Mr. Clements' editor should have told him that if you want to write a personal finance book you have to actually endorse something. OK, to be fair, he likes stocks. But not much else. A humorless, discouraging look at finance. Not a book to read when depressed or looking for an inspiration for your next investment. Clements tells you how bad everything from owning a house to life insurance can be, how you'll never get ahead, earn 10%, beat inflation (he is obsessed with inflation and mentions it on almost every page----no exageration) and how everything will be eaten up by taxes. I couldn't wait to finish this. The most un-fun book on investing I've read."
2,Very disappointed,"I purchased this retro bar table, specifically because of its 30"" diameter top. IT'S NOT 30"" round, it's 24"" round. The so called ""formica"" top is painted mdf. The chrome legs don't feel as if the finish will last very long either. The two good things I can say is, despite all of this, it is attractive and the metal ring around the black table top feels like it's made with some quality. This shipped from Hot Products and I can't say enough good things about there outstanding customer service. I only wish the table was as good a quality as they are."
2,"great for baby, but not made well!!!!","Our son is now 3 months old. We have used these bottles since he came home from the hospital. The other day he started whaling while I was feeding him. He had touched the bottom of the bottle and cut his finger. The bottle had several cracks in it on the bottom rim. When I looked at the others they all had at least one crack. We think this came from the bottle warmer even though we used the disposable bottle insert. He is a very gassy baby and these worked well for him. We tried the vent-aires for 2 days and had nothing but tears, screams and spitting up. We are now going to try the Avents."
3,"I hate it, but Baby just loves it","I have one of those babies who just wouldn't take a bottle. Desperate to get a break from nursing, I took the suggestion of a friend and tried the Playtex nurser. This was the only bottle my son took for 6 months. I was finally able to get him to take the Avent bottle, which I think is alot easier to fill, travel with, etc.. But if you have a baby who turns his nose up at the bottle, this may be your only hope."
1,How do you mix 8 oz of formula in these???,"I wish someone could tell me how they have no problem mixing 8 oz of formula in these bottles? Each liner holds exactly 8 ounces of formula. When I'm on-the-go with my son, I fill the liner with the required amount of water (6 ounces is what he eats now), then when he's ready to eat, I pour in 3 scoops of powdered formula, which fills the liner to the top. So how in the world are these 8 ounce bottles?? I could see if you premix the formula in a pitcher or use concentrated formula, but you cannot make an 8 ounce bottle with powered formula. Even if you carry an extra container with you with 8 oz of water in it, then mix in the 4 scoops of formula, it will not fit in the bottle after it's mixed. I wish I would have thought of this before I bought 10 of these at $4 each. When my son starts eating more 0unces I will have to get new bottles!!!!"
5,NO MORE GAS !,These are BY FAR the best bottles. They are the best for gassy tummys! My mom used them with my sister (25 now) me (19) and my younger brother (14). The complaint I'm hearing the most is that it's hard to mix enough formula in them. I didn't find this as a problem b/c we mix the formula in a tupperware juice holder and pre make our bottles b4 we leave the house. I find that easier than dumping powdered stinkey formula all over the car ! :) Just a suggestion.
3,Kind of difficult...,"I am still not going to give up on this bottle until I get a hang of it...the problem that I have with it is the disposable bag. I've read that it is supposed to contract as baby sucks in the milk, but it hasn't been doing that, I have done what the directions have said by squeezing out the air through the nipple and having my baby latch on, but it doesn't work. I know that you are supposed to keep pushing the bag in as baby gets more milk, but it is kind of a hassle. I also was reading the reviews where another reviewer stated there is only one sealing disc, and that is true...you can only store one bag at a time with this starter set, and you have to go out and buy another set, which only contains four. I will continue to use these bottles but not on a regular basis, I've found that ventaires work better, they aren't a hassle at all, but the playtex nursers have the advantage of transferring bag to bottle. We will see how well it goes and will update this review in the future."
4,Fragile,"I didn't even get to see how well this bottle stood up to the bottle tests I've designed (I don't want to have to deal with leaks, etc.) because I dropped it and it broke. The plastic is hard, but thinner than the standard Playtex disposible nurser.I went and bought another one, so I could hopefully run it through my little test before the little one arrives. It performed as well as the standard Playtex disposible nurser.This many not to be the bottle for traveling or when baby is self-mobile, but when they are small and Mommy & Daddy have to feed them, they are great.Also, all parts can be used on other Playtex disposible bottles. SAVING YOU $$$ :-)"
5,Beautiful Adventure,"Such a beautiful and gentle book! I now have this incredible image of that region fantasized in my brain. I was laughing out loud many times in the book and had to stop and read aloud passages to my partner as well. I caught him quite a few times reading my book instead of his own as we sat next to each other. I really love Chris' spirit. It's winning, gentle and very determined."
3,Sour Lemons,"I love Spain and when I saw this book was extremely excited and looking forward to reading it. Unfortunately, I found the book to be a bit short on charm. Although episodic in structure, the author sometimes gets a bit side-tracked and begins focusing too much attention and detail on the more technical aspects of owning a home in Spain--do we really need a whole chapter on water irrigation? The people are what is most interesting here and not enough time is spent painting vivid portraits of what is really the most enjoyable part about traveling--the characters you meet."
1,"Yes, knobs are poor.","I hope that with this controller I will easily use garageband in the gig.But the package came to me in this morning and i played the 'First' song of my garaband file excitedly, then one of the knobs was taken off. Inside of the knob was broken. I can not believe this situation. So, I pulled out all the knobs, then I found all the knobs were almost broken.What a disappointment with this controller! I will not purchase other products of M-Audio from now on. Maybe it's the worst controller in this world."
4,Valkyrie,"Like Patton it is something you may not watch regularly, but it is an excellent film nonetheless. Great cast, good directing, detailed costumes, and awesome effects make it one of the better war thrillers. Most people know about this attempt at killing Hitler, but few know the level of planning that went into it. This movie does a magnificent job of drawing us into the plot and the people that tried to bring about his downfall. The successes and failures will surprise you. Well worth the time of the family especially on DVD. Definitely worth a rental and most war movie fans will probably want to own it. Great quality picture and sound along with several features to make it a nice addition to your library. If you enjoyed this catchDefiance.CA Luster"
3,plenty of unsuspenseful moments,"Yes, Valkyrie may be a pretty solid movie regardless of certain obvious factors such as poor audio (I was struggling *hard* to hear the majority of the speech taking place in the film despite having the volume on my TV set extremely high- it felt like everyone was mumbling) and there's definitely a lot of boring talking segments where nothing even remotely interesting happens (the first half, mostly) and of course, the film has a typical overdramatic feel to it thanks to the inclusion of Tom Cruise AND Hollywood (a devastating combination) but eventually (key word there) the storyline does improve, the suspense eventually enters the picture, and the quality of the film overall goes way up.I'm still pretty disappointed though. The ads were making it seem like this would be the best war movie in several years and sadly that's not the case."
2,A BAD DVD,THE DVD WE PURCHASED WOULD NOT WORK IN TWO DIFFERENT PLAYERS. WE FIRST TRIED IT IN OUR PLAYER AND THEN HAD OUR DAUGHTER TAKE IT HOME AND ATTEMPT TO PLAY IT. IT DID NOT WORK IN EITHER OF THEM.
3,Good Movie but not Great,It was a good movie but a little slow in the beginning. Definitely not a 4 or 5 star movie though. It really wasn't as suspenseful as I had hoped. They should have really focused on the horrors of Hitler and the Nazis more to build up the tension. The movie was almost set in a vacuum. All in all it was still worth watching.
2,Be sure Fuhrer is dead first!,"Says it is a movie based on a true event. Okay well we all know that Hitler did not die before the bunker death with Eva. Not going to do an extensive review about Tom Cruise and all that stuff all the positive reveiwers wrote about. I paid $1.70 for this DVD (used).""Be sure the Fuhrer is dead before you overthrow the Nazis!"" Just did not happen,think somebody needed to see the dead Hitler before all this garbage to take over Germany started to unfold.Not the best Hitler movie I have watched. Felt like I wasted time watching this DVD. Was a great idea to stop the maddness but make sure you take care of business. I would prefer a work of fiction where it actually seemed to have happened over this Tom Cruise joke."
2,A Snoozer,"I am probably being mean not to give it three stars, but I am penalizing it a star for doing so little with such great material and disappointing me so much.Visually, it was splendid....Nazism in all its cinematic grandeur. But, incredibly, it was flat, flat, flat as a story."
4,Valkyrie,"Valkyrie Was a Pretty Good movie I think. On the events leading to the failed plot to get rid of a monster.A Monster Just Like Castro,Lenin,Stalin,Mao and Che. Sadly there will always be Tyrants in this World. I think the Valkyrie Movie Did Justice to the plot. Rent it and see for yourself, It's way Better than Glorious."
1,Really? This? A Good Movie?,"Think along the lines of point and realism...What is the point of watching a PG-13 movie about Nazi's from the Nazi point of view about the plot to kill Hitler.How can someone seriously make a film about Nazi's, and expect it to be realistic, and still get a PG-13 rating. I also found myself lost as to why the Nazi's had various accents from across the world, but none sounded like they were German...AND, the writing on certain forms (not all forms) was German, yet nobody spoke German.Plus, everybody already knew (if they paid attention in history class) that Hitler committed suicide. So why waste your time watching a film about something that you know is not going to work in the first place, only to pull for a Nazi posing as a good guy, and all under a family friendly rating?Need I say more?"
1,Sloppy,"This movie was created with a great disregard to historical facts. The acting is horrible. The movie felt like it was made in a matter of days. If you want to learn history, read books. This movie is a farce."
1,the writing is an atrocity!! hahahaha,"A concatenation of cliches, stiltedly delivered--esp. by the king of the school of rigormortis-y acting, Tom Cruise. Stiff as the starch in a Scientologist's SeaOrg button-down collar, Cruise is a hoot: so superserious hence silly. Poor the rest of the cast! Good Brits--Tom Wilkinson, Bill Nighy, even Ken Branagh--wasted.As bad as ""Defiance,"" the recent too-good-to-be true Jews-in-the-woods travesty.Risible and sententious."
2,"Great movie, bad set...","The only thing I want to say about the movie itself is that it is pretty good. If you are just going off the negative review then do yourself a favor and rent it.Now, for those collectors that like two-disc sets with extra features, skip this edition. The only thing this set has over the one-disc is the digital copy. You will be paying $10+ for a digital copy."
4,retells a complex story in riveting fashion,"This was a really good retelling of the failed assination attempt on Hitler. As complicated as the plot of the men involved was, the movie made it pretty easy to follow along and moved at a brisk pace. The suspense and build-up work very well , especially considering you see very little war action. Tom Cruise did very well playing the defiant Colonel although hearing him voice the lines in English was a bit weird at first, but short of learning German on the spot and using subtitles, not unexpected. I enjoyed this movie."
4,An Important Story that Left me Wanting More,"Valkyrie was well done. It moved at a good pace and was entertaining. Based upon the actual assassination plot against Hitler it does have some marks of a documentary, but that adds rather than detracts. The cast is excellent. Cruise underplays his role, which is surprising for him, but effective. The supporting cast features many well known actors and they all bring their 'A' game. I rented the single disk which lacked the documentary of the two disk set. You will want to learn more after watching the movie so definitely get the two disk version. Well worth seeing."
4,Good Stuff For Gene Wolfe Fans,"This book was really fun to read. For me, a few parts were sort of boring, hence the four star rating. The pieces are so varied though, that there is something for everyone. If you loved the Book of the New Sun, then this collection is worth a few bucks."
3,"good, but......","i love x men have done for years probably always will and this is a good collection of stories...the lifedeath stuff about storm is good, forge (one of my favourite characters)gets introduced, wolverine is his usual self, magneto makes an apearance as a good guy....generally theres a lot of goodbut...its maybe just before this time but man do these comics become grim and miserable...i know its a bit old fashioned but sometimes a nice little bit of escapism would be nice rather than mutant angst over and over...i mean hell does anyone actually break a smile during the whole book?? as mentioned before theres a lot of other stuff going on such as secret wars and new mutants so a lot of plots just seem to go awol by the next story....it is a good collection of stories...but...its not got the same classic status as Byrne era or Jim Lee era....recommended cautiously"
3,I don't know.,"I like the guitar, but it's not right. It had a quality control check sticker on it but I don't think so. This thing wouldn't hold a tune, and produced false notes. I worked on it and got it to play ok but it's still a little buzzy. It's light and easy to play, and I haven't changed the original D'Addario strings yet. so that could help. I think of it as something Jack White would play.The price was right and it shipped on time."
3,Not quite up to standards,"I've read a number of black lace books this one fell short of my expectation. This book is set in a victorian setting with a curious virgin as the heroine and a enlish gentleman with strong eastern overtones as the ""hero."" This put me off right away, being not only increadably passe but completely improbable. This set up also had the side effect of jolting me out of the world the author was creating.This book gets three stars because the scenes were good. The main characters in this book only have intercourse with each other which is a nice change from other black lace books. It also contains a lot of role playing between the main characters."
5,THIS IS HOT!I,"If you havent picked up Mya's Moodring yet, you must do so! It has all the right songs for the summer. Love,Excitement, and Personality. So hit it up at your local record sales store! Holla"
5,Mya Harrison is a true diva. Her album is like wo...,"Mya Harrison is great in Moodring so are the other album. her songs are great and really sexy, sophisticated. This album is better than beyonce,ashanti,mary j,j-lo I promised you you will be amased with her voice she is really great. make sure you watch her at the movies on dirty dancing 2 havanna night."
4,Mya is like...WO,"The first time that I heard about Mya was in 2001 because of the the #1, grammy winner international hit ""Lady Marmelade"" next to Christina Aguilera, Lil'kim and ""P!nk"". Ok let's be honest but out of the U.S Mya, Lil'Kim and Pink were not famous or even heard of. The song gave them the opportunity of their lives. So after the impact of Lady marmelade I bought Mya's ""Fear of flying"" cd because I found her good. The cd was good but nothing more than ""good"".So when ""Moodring"" came out I bought it and let me say that as soon as I heard the first song I found it very good, the whole cd is fantastic. It has great rythms, Mya's voice is also very good and the lyrics are strong and direct.Some other good songs are: ""Fallen"", ""Hurry up"", ""You"" and ""Free falling"".Mya took a long time to come back but it was worth it."
4,Mya's better than ever,"I've bought all of Mya's CD, and this one has been my favorite so far. She certainly doesn't have the strongest voice...Beyonce, whom she is often pitted against, does have her beat in that department. However, Mya does have a total package, and there's an originiality about her that is refreshing...and it's best seen on this album. My favorite song is ""Anatomy,"" I can listen to it over and over. I loved it right off, but I think that it has to grow on some people. I also really enjoy ""Step,"" ""Sophisticated Lady,"" and ""Why You Gotta Look So Good."" I'm not sure ""Fallen"" should have been the second single, because there are certainly better tracks, but I hope she brings out another single that will help people see how good this CD really is."
1,HORRIBLE!!!!!!!!!!,"Unoriginal, boring, a waste of good money for any of you still buying c.d.'s out there. I recieved this one as a gift unfortunately. It will be making it's way to a used record store very, very soon!!There is absolutely nothing catchy about it (even the single, ""My Love Is Like Woo"" puts me to sleep!!!). I highly recommend you skip this c.d. and buy something with a little more heart and imagination.Who was the moron who thought that this c.d. should be recorded in the first place???!!!AVOID, or you'll be sorry!!!!!!!!!!!!!!"
5,"MYA,MYA,MYA YOU'RE A STAR","THIS IS ONE OF THE BEST ALBUMS OF 2003, I LOVE MYA'S MUSIC AND SHE'S A GREAT SINGER. ALL THE SONGS ARE GREAT AND MYA IS ONE OF BEST R&B SINGERS OUT THERE SHE DOESNT GET AS MUCH REP AS SHE SHOULD. CANT WAIT UNTIL SHE RELEASES HER 4TH ALBUM. MOOODRING WENT GOLD.MYA IS GREAT!!!!!!!!!!!!!!"
5,One of if not the best album this year,"You'll notice how much Mya has matured listening to this cd. Her best cd yet, and i'm sure not her last. Buy this album, you will not be disappointed, and if u are, then you must be an ashanti fan. Mya, Beyonce, Monica, Blu Cantrell, if u don't have any of these cds, then what are u waiting for. Now all im waiting for is Tamia's new cd which comes out next month, can't wait. But back to Mya, I love 14 of the 17 tracks on here, im not saying that the other 3 songs are bad, just not for me."
4,Moodring brings out the freak in you.,"Moodring is wonderful. This is the Mya we've been waiting for! She comes out supersexy, superfreaky, and it's all a big turn on! The first three songs will have you wanting to find your significant other and get in the mood!"
3,The black Britney Spears,"Mya - Moodring (Interscope, 2003)I was never a Mya fan but I listened to this album at a friend's house and picked it up. There are actually a couple of good songs on here (the subpar first single, ""My Love is Like Wo"", is not one of them). The bounce track, ""Whatever B****"", is surprisingly good, while ""After the Rain"" is pretty moving. ""Things Come and Go"" featuring Sean Paul (what would a 2003 urban album be without him?) samples a Shuggie Otis tune and is also good. People laugh at the fact that her duet with Common used in that Coke commercial is on here, but the truth is that it's better than most of the songs on here. Everything else ranges from tolerable to skippable, so pick it up or borrow it if you're not a fan. -EJR"
1,My Love for this album is like EWW!,"I am upset because her last two albums were great so I bought this one under the assumption it would be good too...well u know what they say about those who assume. The beats were horrid and there aren't any ""sultry"" songs that really show her voice. Im gonna buy tamias album and thats it. And they wonder why people download music- because it isnt worth BUYING!"
3,Not the best.,"Mya isn't a phenomenal singer -- she has an okay voice, but she's better on tracks where she's featured or where she doesn't have a large part. Her last CD, ""Fear of Flying,"" was pretty good, but she shows again that she can't really carry a whole album with ""Moodring."" There are a few songs that stand out and are pretty good -- ""My Love Is Like...Wo,"" ""Fallen,"" and my favorite, ""Anatomy 1 on 1."" ""Sophistcated Lady"" is an okay track, and then there's ""Real Compared to What"" that she did with Common for the Coca-Cola commercials, but the rest of them kind of just blend together and aren't distinct from each other or command listening."
3,Not sure if it good,"I feed my fish in the outside pond. It sinks to the bottom. I don't know if the fish can get it.Normally, it float on the surface"
2,Mistake,I had previously bought my fish food at Petsmart and decided to try this. My koi and goldfish just didn't like it! They wouldn't eat it and it just floated around the koi pond.
1,Not suitable for Koi,"I'm not sure what the issue is but my koi fish refused to eat this. I need to change to a different brand. Now, I'm stuck with a 10-lb bag.Anyway, if you still want to try this brand, only buy a small quantity, to see if your fish would eat it."
4,good deal,"Bought this food for my gold fish, they normally would'nt even touch anything but flakes, but to our supprise they gobbled it up and this brand is so expensive in the pet stores. Great deal for pond fish food."
4,Fascinating World,"If you're simply passionately into SF you will love this book. It's a bummer that people write irrelevant reviews (how is 375 pages ""a short book""?), but I think anyone who can appreciate a truly inventive vision of a dystopian future will love it. The world that Budz has created is so meticulously detailed and thought out that you never need to suspend your disbelief. I can't wait to read the sequel."
5,Eddie Arnold Rules!!! Great Classic Western!!!,The late great singer Eddie Arnold rules in this great classic western.It's a must see that really should be released on DVD!!!!
4,a great mix of anthems and soulful house,"cevin puts forth a great mix of some of great anthems (studio 45's ""freak it"", ""the break"", submission's ""women beat their men"", and both his own ""house music"", and ""the freaks come out"") and some more soulful, deep house with tracks like ""beautiful day"", ""i am"", ""free"", and ""sunrise"". it's a great mix through out, showing off cevin's great skills at mixing. great track selection, wonderful mixing, it will get you shaking and having a good time before you know it. this is a bit more of an after hours mix, although it has some good prime time dance floor tracks, it has more of a tinge of a late night set."
1,Cocktocock Tales of Greece,"This book is one of the most boring, badly written, unimaginitve books I have ever read. Bad grammar and repititious action with very little variation, except, perhaps, the object of the lust."
1,Wrong disks shipped twice,"The packaging is ambiguous. It just says ""Adhesive Pads"" with no part number and the disks aren't visible through the packaging because they're sandwiched between the front and back cardboard packaging inside the sealed plastic outer packaging.When I opened up the first shipment it was a three pack of the permanent disks (there's a penny-sized hole in the middle of the pad, the temporary pads are solid).I had to do an RMA and pay for the return envelope.The replacement shipment was the same, incorrect, permanent disks.Why is this so difficult to get right?"
4,challenging reading; not for the timid,"Geoffrey Hill is among the best three or four British poets of his generation. His poems are challenging: they require a strong knowledge of history, religion, and literary allusions, as well as the decipherment of thorny syntax and obscure symbolism. But to interpret these traits as weaknesses would be mistaken. One can continue to read verse in the colloquial, Blake/Wordsworth/Frost/Williams tradition ... or one can tackle poetry which requires real effort to understand it. Hill offers the latter."
5,Really like this series,"I read this series some time ago. I saw one of the books and wanted to re-read it, but realised I only had the one book, not all three in the series. This 3-in-1 book is a nice solution. The books center on the three daughters of Thomas Concannon. Each is quite different in personality. The stories deal with each sister finding love and happiness in their chosen careers, while learning to cope with each other as sisters and daughters. Very enjoyable."
5,Professional results in half the time,"I spend about half the time in the kitchen due to the fast simple approach to cooking that is served up in this book. The ingredients are fresh, simple and healthy... The photos of each recipe are wonderfully arranged and give you an appetite to try the meal. The first chapter telling you what a well stocked pantry should have also makes it easier to prepare any given recipe on the fly... an essential for anyone who works and likes to come home and prepare a fresh imaginative meal... I feel like I have gotten terrific family response from my teenage niece and nephew when they saw me preparing the pink apple tarts... imagine that...as a working woman it has made cooking a creative joy. This book has become the standard by which I would choose any other cookbook."
5,"Stylish, colorful watch.","This is a really fun and fashionable watch. It has a bangle style band and can be worn slightly loose or snug. I like the pink dial that changes color. Depending on the angle and lighting, the dial looks pink, yellow or purple. I also like how Fossil made the band adjustable. Remove or add as many links as necessary. There is no need to have the watch adjusted at the jewelry counter."
1,Dishonest Company,"This product advertises no MSG added but if you look in the ingredients it has Autolyzed Yeast Extract, which is essentially the same thing..."
5,BUY THIS IMMEDIATELY,"I just saw her live in Austin, and her show is absolutely amazing. I plan on seeing her as many times as possible. It is a great album, I love every song (Which is quite rare for my picky tastes). But it immediately, and if you live in Texas look out for her, she is sooooooo amazing."
5,Great Smell,Great product. I would recommend it to anyone. Smells great. Better than axe body sprays. A must have for my fellow man.
4,Review of Weinmann 519 bicycle rim,"Rim was generally beautiful. It was, I think, the only Weinmann rim with a shoulder on which the tire bead could sit and be held during a flat. Research has shown that rider safety after a tire deflation can depend crucially on whether or not the tire is held on the shoulders. It was therefore disappointing that all the other styles had no shoulders, and there was no guarantee that a tire would be held on the shoulders of this rim."
5,A Must-Have Resource for Every Freelancer,"This book is well organized, extremely informative and even entertainingly anecdotal. Dr. Shaw is a real veteran and her tips and guidelines reveal those years of experience. Her examples take the information a step further and help illustrate the point being made. I highly recommend this book for anyone who is serious about freelance writing."
2,inspiring despite poor organization and sloppy writing,"I never return books. But after reading the first two chapters of The Successful Writer's Guide to Publishing Magazine Articles, I dug the packaging box back out of the recycling bin. After skimming through the rest of the book, I was rummaging through the trash for the packing slip. The writer may have good advice but I just couldn't get past the dull, flat writing and the disorganized content to find it. As another reviewer commented, it's inspiring to know that if the author of this book could get published, there's hope for the rest of us. Disappointing to say the least."
5,CFH was NOT a debut album,"This is to correct all the folks that are being fed false info about Pantera...CFH is a highlight album from a band that discarded a glam image and then pretends it doesn't exist they had 4 albums prior to CFH...Metal Magic, Projects In The Jungle, I Am The Night, and Power Metal. Power Metal was Phil Anselmos first album with the band and it is in all fairness a good album...but CFH is a killer album with no filler on there at all anyone interested in Pantera owes it to themselves to get this album. Diamond Darrel (thats right Diamond Darrel) absolutely shreds his heart out and Vinnie Paul and Rex Rocker supply a rock solid rhythm section that never misses a beat. Dimebag indeed..."
5,Metal to The Bone,"These guys live, breath, eat, and sleep Heavy Metal. You won't find a more dedicated, or even tenacious band like this anywhere! Right from the beginning, Pantera lures in the listener with hard-core riffs and defiant lyrics. Dime Bag Darrel is a great guitarist. His style drives to the very root of one's nervous system. And, Phil Anselmo provides these tremendous vocals that can only have come from a guy who was weened on Metal! The drummer, Vinnie Paul's playing never misses a beat, and he seems to play almost tirelessly through these hard-hitting songs. This is an album that I would recommend for any Heavy Metal fan."
3,unsealed?,product was a nice clean disc but what really got me was the unsealed CD case and the damage on the CD case it came in. the CD itself was perfect.
4,My First Album,"This was my first album, and a good heavy metal album to start with. If are getting in to heavy metal, or are new to music, I would start with speed metal, and possibly this album. It sounds great, and isn't very deppressing. Phillip Anselmos voice, tops many other song artists, and has a huge range. Though Pantera is compared to Limp BIzkit, they are much more talented and much better. Cowboys from Hell and Cemetary Gates are the best songs on this album. This is a good album, the best Pantera one, but the song's order is rather poorly organized (putting Domination, then Shattered after Cemetary Gates.) Pantera isn't as heavy as death metal, and isn't as deppresing, as death metal, or grunge, and though i do like bands like Opeth, and In Flames, or Grunge, like Alice in Chains, it is good to start with. Also try Mettalica's black album, or, my favorite, Master of the Puppets."
5,pick yourself up a copy...or download it,just make sure to pick up this CD Before you die so you can spend your last moments knowing you listened to what metal really is!
2,Don't Roll Well,"Because of the openings in the balls where you feel the textured patches, these do not roll very well and don't even work with some of the playsets. I love other Roll-A-Rrounds though and would give all other sets of them 5 stars."
5,It was toooo easy!!!,"I set my Havarhart 1078 trap at 10:30 pm and by 12:00 am I caught a opossum, the first time I even used it. Very durable, easy to use. I might purchase a bigger one to catch that bill collector that keeps come around my house. :-) Darryl in Florida"
1,No show,"After several WEEKS, and after the scheduled delivery date, I was advised the item was not available, and my money was refunded. Civility prevents my commenting further."
5,Works great!,"I have caught 3 rabbits so far. It works great! Haven't caught any in recent days, so I think I may have caught all the culprits in my yard."
3,No squirrels yet.,"We had squirrels in the attic, a boar, a sow and they were starting on their second litter. I had tried mothballs and everything else to get rid of them with no luck. Finally put the new roof on the house after a hailstorm got the old one and then bought the Havahart 1078. We have so many pecans on the place the squirrels are not interested in peanut butter or even pecans in the trap. However, it ""sets"" easily and I figure if one of the varmints does go into it, game over! The trap is sturdy, well finished and appropriate for the large fox squirrels we have around the house. Haven't heard them in the attic so maybe we got the inlets covered with the new roof. I'm betting after we have all the pecans harvested, we will catch them and haul them off."
5,Just Perfect!,"I love these! The rectangular shape works much better than round in the fridge, as they stack and don't waste space. Of course the Pyrex quality is wonderful. Highly recommend. I may purchase an additional set."
5,Pyrex products,As always PYREX products at Amazon's low price are the best deals ever offered to Slickdealers
3,Quite confused about the story,I have read this book in Thai and i was quite confused coz it seemed that the story in the book happening soooooo fast and not quite good as her first book of this series...may be because of translation that make things worse...when i have finish reading this book in english i will review again...
1,What happened here?,"I was a big fan of Parappa the Rapper and I was seriously disappointed with this sequel. It's bad enough that you can beat it in 30 minutes, but what's worse is that you wouldn't want to! The music is just bad and that is inexcusable for a music game. Where are all the catchy tunes? I can't remember one line from this game, whereas I have all of Parappa the Rapper's songs memorized. It's missing those great lyrics found in Parappa like my favorite: ""Sunny in my life, she's like a dice, I can't tell which way to turn 'till I spice!"" Skip UmJammer and get Parappa."
4,great book,A wonderful books with no visible rips or tears library book quality. I love the level of excellence that it is.
3,Good...but not Great!,"This is The Kingpins second CD.. the first song ""King of The Jungle"" is very good.also ""Manon, Viens Danser Le Ska"" is sung in French. over all this is a good Ska CD but I like their first CD better."
2,"Provocative topic, but not too original","Everything that could have ever been written about teenagers and their sex lives has been written. This book proves itself to be very trite -- covering ground that has already been traversed, offering very limited insight, and looking at very little new reserach. Not only that, but it does not include an index, so there is now way for readers to thumb through and find relevant information....Good organization could have saved this from the remainder pile -- it could have been another manual about sex. But alas, even that did not happen...."
5,"A Great Versatile, Flexible, Portable Security Mirror","For me, the happy surprise about this mirror was how clear, wide, and far it's field of vision is.I was hoping that it would be well made and that the clip would spread wide enough to clip on 1"" plus wide objects -- and it delivered on both of those counts too.The goose neck is fairly stiff but has plenty of flex to position the mirror just how you want it. It then holds the position you set firmly.The best thing about the mirror is that its portablity allows you to easily experiment with different locations.If you need a convex mirror like this to keep an eye on somewhere, but don't want to spend the big bucks for a commercial one or aren't certain yet, then buy this one. You won't be disappointed.The 7"" diameter is surprisingly big. Personally, I would not buy any smaller, but check it out on a ruler and make sure you won't mind that size for your location."
3,Directions.,I just received the pump but the directions do not tell a purchaser how to use it. The picture shows it with the water inlet on the topbut the purpose of the pump is to get as much water off the pool as you can. Seems to me the water inlet should show the pump upside down from the picture on the instructions enclosed with the pump. I am hoping that the pump can be placed any way you want and it will work because its a self contained waterproof pump.
5,wow,"mind blowing guitarist, anyone that says its been all done, wake up, just listen to his techique, it's been done but nothing like this . borislav is amazing , i can't wait for his next project."
4,Well written and hard to put down,"I bought this book and several others to prepare myself for the transition from VB6 to VB.NET. I wish they would have covered the disconnected datasets, ADO.NET and ASP.NET in more detail. I would have given it 5 stars if it had.Other than that, I feel that it is an excellent resource to prepare a programmer from any background for VS.NET. It does a good job of covering the OOP, Inheritance, Overloading, and multithreading subjects in a concise manner.The book also has a web site for errata and source code. Gary Cornell is a good author and it shows in this book he co-authored.I have a few Wrox Publishing Books, but my library is starting to collect more an more APRESS books because their style and format is what I expect from a book.Wrox does publish some good books also:I would also recommend .NET Enterprise Development in VB.NET from Design to Deployment, ISBN 1861006179, (Wrox Publishers)"
5,All Natural,"Nice debut album from New Jersey based crew Organic Thoughts. Solid production accompanied by valued rhyme content. Should be interesting to see what happens with their sophomore release.Definately on the look-out for more El-Gambina projects. She is undoubtedly proving she's a stand-out, not just the token female emcee."
4,Icy cool hip-hop,"If you don't feel like listening to mainstream hardcore hip-hop with some dude talking about how much money he's got, or how he's the best MC or how he screw gold diggas and leave them, then I recommend this treat here. It's on the same jazzy, R&B level as Tribe Called Quest and it's something to lay back on. Check out "" Playa can you see"" and "" Swing My way"". Those two are definant gems."
2,"Actual title should be ""Bardeux: From Dominating Divas To Ditzy Duds In One Year""","""Bold As Love"", Bardeux's first album, was so amazing that I was nothing short of dangerously excited when I found out that they actually had two albums to their credit. Unfortunately, they went straight down the drain with this one. This is as bland and soulless as their first album was beautiful and captivating. Plus, this was 1989, not 1950; it was common knowledge by now that smoking is not cool (one of the songs contains a lyric in which one of the girls says something to the effect of ""smoking my cigarette while I'm waiting here for you"" or something like that). The only reason that I don't condemn this to the dungeon of 1-star albums is because there is no overt explicitness in it."
5,Started on a whole new mystery series and a fine writer.,"Am a regular reader of mysteries. How I'd missed Sallis I don't know. I am pleased to ""discover"" him and his wonderful characters. He has a fine feel for my favorite city to visit: New Orleans, and gives a sound psychological sense to his characters. Even the minor characters stand out as people I would be interested to know. I took several quotes from the book and introduced them to a class I was teaching on Human Identity. The words just fit right into the context of the class. Now I've read Black Hornet and am waiting for more."
5,Aluminum Is Better Than Plastic,"I have been using this lens hood on my canon for 3 years and it does exactly what a lens hood should do. It has the added advantage of being able to be fixed after it has been bent and it works as well as new.It does not vignette, even at 24mm.If you're sick of plastic lens hoods, this is for you."
1,Outdated material,"Required textbook for FNP program. Publication date is 2004. Material is outdated. Found the information overall insufficient for learning or good reference. Too much ""touchy feely"" information and not enough practical information. Book constantly refers to other sections of the book.Would not recommend this book to anyone"
4,Great Enticing Read,"Parallel story lines across the centuries works very well. I did find the 19th century dialog and character/location more descriptive. Provides enticing tidbits of information that leave reader hopeful of a sequel (or prequel!). Does Edgar go to find Jonathan? Is Marissa truly psychic? Is the bad ""guy"" off the radar screen? Will Stephen move on to find a new love of his life? And others."
2,ght thi,"We bought this about a year and a half ago. Worked great for about a year. Then we started experiencing problems (as explained by others here) with the milk frother just popping into the milk. What a pain!OK...so we could live with that, because honestly, we only used the espresso side of it a couple times a month. However, last month the plastic cover on the coffee side snapped at the hinges and it stopped making coffee. Thinking the two problems were related, I took it apart and fixed the top with epoxy. Got it all back together....and.....it still does not make coffee anymore. There must be a pressure leak somewhere because the water doesn't even make it all the way up the drip tube...just steam.And, to top it off, Krups ""Service Center"" is a complete oxymoron. Impossible to get any service there at all, let alone parts. Time to get a new machine. No more Krups for me...."
2,"Good Espresso, no froth","I was given this maker as a gift (though I chose it because it was economical), and am disappointed. The frother does not work. I have had boiler type machines that outperformed this one at a third the cost. The steam never builds up enough pressure to properly froth milk for cappucino. The espresso function is good, however, as is the coffee. I think it is probably too late to return the machine, so my friend wasted $200."
1,Do Not Buy,"The espresso side of this machine is a complete piece of garbage. Steamer has never worked properly. Serious water leakage. And finally after two months of use the espresso maker just stopped working completely. Wish I'd read the other reviews before I bought. Coffee maker works fine but I bought it primarily for the espresso. Debating whether or not to have it serviced or just toss it, leaning towards the latter, as it seems this machine is just fatally flawed to begin with."
1,"Tank Leaks, Poor Quality","I think Krups cuts some corners on this one. Cheap parts, made even more frustrating by the fact that they do (used to?) make good products that would last years. The espresso part is awkward and difficult, and I've been a barista. The regular coffee side is also a mess because the actual water tank leaks. I contacted Krups, and they said they stopped making the machine in 2006 despite the fact that it is readily available & still being sold new in both stores and online. They said they wouldn't stand behind ""such an old machine"" regardless of when it was purchased. Beware! If you buy Krups in person, check the code on the bottom for the last 2 numbers of the manufacturing date. In short, don't buy this= poor customer service, unreliable product."
1,Krups XP2010 combination coffee/expresso machine,I have had this machine for only six months. It suddenly stopped brewing coffee on the right side. One year warranty. Company refuses to take it back. They want me to ship it to New York for service at my expense. Cost approx. $30.00. What a ripoff. Do not buy from this company and save your money.
1,3rd machine and it has been into get fixed twice! in first 6 months,I got this as a gift for my wife. First one leaked from the coffee machine side out of the box took it back to the store I got it from and the second one did the same thing. Third one worked for maybe 6 months then the expresso side would not work and it was shipped off to get fixed under warranty. Got it back and before a month was out it was doing the same thing so back into the shop for repairs. I would look for a different product then this if I had it to do over again. Looks great and when working was not to bad but have had a lot of issues.
1,Very Disappointing,"I got this unit a year ago as a Christmas gift. It worked ok until 4 days out of warranty when one of the wires to the heating element on the coffee side fried rendering it useless as a coffee maker. When I say it worked ""ok"" before that I mean it, it didn't work great or good, just ok. At a glance XP2010 looks solid and well made for a home unit but the housing and water storage container(on the coffee side) is made of a cheap brittle plastic, the hinge for the coffee door broke within the first few uses. Within a couple months water started to leak ever time coffee was made, which I suspect may have had a part in frying the heater, causing a big mess on the counter every morning. I never had major problems with the espresso side, but it is slow to heat up and warming milk will take a good five minutes. This machine is too expensive for the quality, and I would recommend not purchasing this model.I would not purchase a Krups coffee/espresso maker again."
4,Great picture book,"I purchased several of these books for my son when he was born. I love the fact real pictures of things where used, not illustrations. It's been a great book and now that he 2 years old we use it to learn how to spell words. I only wish is was bigger with more pictures."
3,Maybe I got a lemon??,"My Dad got this for me during christmas and I thought this was a nice MP3 player. Unfortunately, it wasn't as good as i thought, one thing i dislike about this product is that it kept on crashing my computer whenever i tried to transfer MP3 music file to the jukebox. Also, it can get really hot, I meant REALLY HOT! i thought the jukebox was going to explode! Maybe i got a lemon but the good thing was that my dad returned for a refund after i had it for two weeks."
2,Too difficult for someone who is not into gadgets,"I bought this product as a gift for my brother, figuring that the hours and hours of music that it can store would bring a smile to his face. Alas, he could not figure out how to make it work and returned it for a refund. I am not sure whose fault that is (the mfr or my brother) but I thought I would write this review to alert potential purchasers that at least one user had a problem figuring out how to make the Nomad work."
1,I'm melting (what a world),"I was so excited when I bought this, thinking about how many songs I could put in and listen. I enjoyed it for about a month. However, after a night of charging the batteries, they faded after one song. No problem, I had a backup set, or so I thought. I had never used them so I plugged them in to charge up overnight. My dogs woke me up about three in the morning, barking at my desk which was smoldering. I quickly uplugged the jukebox. I checked the batteries, and they were in correctly (I have photos). I beg you, DO NOT PURCHASE THIS ITEM."
5,He is the cutest!,This is the cutest and will be perfect for my hatter party...He will be used with the flamingos in the garden.
3,Very worthwhile for a prospective Pilgrim.,I found this book to be very helpful to me as I am in the planning stages of walking El Camino in 2000. Although I believe that too much stress is put on the spiritual and religious aspect of the walk a lot of practical information is provided as well. I was especially pleased to learn about the infrastructure which has been recently developed to assist Pilgrims. Ms. Frey has researched the subject to a great extent and puts a very positive light on this interesting subject. She has also presented numerous of the varied motives for tackling this venture.
4,Pretty Comprehensive,"An interesting box set compiling diferent aspects of the Doors music. The Live in NYC is pretty strong. Jim is in good voice and the band really rocks. The first disc has some flaws particularly the sound on Five To One. I'm not too crazy about the arrangement on that track as well. Also, Hello To The Cities and Adolph Hitler are perfect examples of wasted space. I would have liked to hear some more tracks from the Doors after Morrison unfortunately passed on. Tightrope Ride with Manzarek on lead vocals is a fairly riveting piece which features an excellent guitar solo by Robbie Krieger.The band favorites disc is pretty sound. Loaded with many of my faves Wishful Sinful, Take It As It Comes, LA Woman, Light My Fire, Peace Frog, I could go on.A solid set with some minor flaws."
2,Don't Waste Your Money,"If I could get my money back, I would. I love The Doors, but this set is virtual garbage. The audio quality of the live stuff is poor at best (Disc 2 is the only decent recording)."
5,ONE HELL OF A SET,"THE DOORS BOX SET A MUST OWN FOR ANY DIE HARD DOORS FAN . IT CONTAINS FOUR CDS OR TAPES. ALL FOUR ARE GREAT. THE SET COMES WITH A NICE BOOKLET, A MUST HAVE. MR. MORRISON AND THE DOORS HAVE REALLY BROKEN ON THROUGH WITH THIS MUST OWN BOXSET."
2,Loses smell quickly,"Silly me, I purchased this book twice because I thought I had a defective book the first time. It had no smell. I found another book that DID have fragrance in the store and bought it for my daughter because I thought she got cheated the first time. Within a month the smells had gone away. Now neither book smells. Bummer! We love Strawberry Shortcake and all her books, but you should be aware of this problem with the book."
1,No smell at all,"I bought this book and thought that I needed to peel off the stickers or had a defective book. There is absolutely no smell! I recently read a scratch and sniff book from 1970, and the smells were wonderful. I wonder why we can't find books like that now?"
1,*scratch-scratch...sniff-sniff* I can't smell a thing.,"It's a cute book, but I think it sucks that there's no smell in it. My little sister sold hers at a yard sale because of this. I would have given this a five if the book actually HAD a darn smell!!!"
3,Awesome World Hip Hop,"Everytime I pop in the Outlandish cd, I can't help but start dancing. These three guys may be from Denmark, but their roots trace back to Honduras, Morocco, and Pakistan, giving them a distinctive and culturally influenced sound. Their hip hop beats are contagious, especially in the song ""Guantanamo."" Their sweet ballad ""Aicha"" is probably their biggest hit on the album, but the whole cd is great. Definitely recommend it."
3,"Good Music, Too Much cursing!","I purchased this CD after listenting to their latest CD ""Closer than Veins"" hoping it was as good. When i got the CD in mail their was a parental advisory sticker on it that i was not aware of before purchasing. I was able to salvage only two songs without any cursing ""aicha & guantanamo"" great songs. their latest CD i already mentioned is much better byfar. these artist are very talented and I hope they keep their next album clean."
3,Broad range of tunes,"Some great selection of a wide variety of tunes here. CD 1 esspecially hits you with track after track of quality. CD2 is not quite up to par with it's counterpart, but it still has a nice selection and progressive mix that takes you on an emotional rollercoaster the way a mix is supposed to.A great Album to get a broad sampling of the genre. Fabio and Grooverider are capable of a mix much deeper than this, but I doubt that that was their intention on this D&B; Arena mix. A great album."

1,"anti-marriage, anti-religion, dull thriller","This was terrible! Lindy Booth as a psychopathic Christian zealot killing the ""sinners""? No thanks. Also, for them to put Eric Roberts on the DVD box when his scene lasts about a minute before he is killed is extremely deceptive to the person buying the film."
5,Great book for kids conflict resolution,We have been using this with the Leaders Guide in our afterschool program for Middle Schoolers grades 5 - 8 and it is wonderful. The topics are framed in a way that kids can relate to. I recommend it!
4,Great band,Sup my ... homies eastside representin da north dirty south. Anyway great cd the vocalist can scream as well as sing which is hard to find in a vocalist anymore. Oh and buy it from amazon.com cause they are the best...
4,"Very nice, professional machine",I bought this for my husband (a true coffee aficionado) for Father's Day. He loves it. He especially likes how fast it makes quality espresso. We had our last Krups coffee/espresso maker for 15 years. If this one lasts 1/2 that long (with how much he uses it) it will be more than worth the money.
5,"Easy, Delicious!","Very pleased with the XP2070. I am a latte fanatic, and was tired of constantly going to starbucks and spending a fortune. I have had the unit for over 2 months now and have not had any problems. Definitely worth the money to buy the unit, and the time to make a delicious espresso."
1,Absolute garbage,"This machine is absolute garbage. There are not enough pejoratives or expletives in the world for me to describe my feelings for this device with anything like the right level of detail.The user interface is like trying to decode an alien artifact. The manual is terrible. The customer service and support is unbelievably bad. It is unreliable and expensive.Get a different espresso machine, go to a coffeeshop, heck, boil coffee in a 55 gallon drum over a pile of oily rags - any of these is a much more satisfactory way to get a coffee drink than using this (insert chain of imaginative diminutives) thing."
1,As Bad as It Gets,"I owned a Salton 3 for All over 10 years old. I thought that with the purchase of this Krups unit I'd be moving up in the world. Boy was I disappointed. The steamer has a detachable nozzle which frequently pops off while frothing milk, splattering everything nearby. The Salton had a 4 shot capacity while this makes only 2 shots at a time, and weaker at that. The Salton for its $99 price included a carafe and steamer jug. You'll have to purchase these separately from Krups. Krups recommends purchase of a separate water filter for the water reservoir for the espresso unit. When it's in place the pump can't draw water through it. I brew espresso every morning. I don't understand how anyone could rate this product favorably if they reguarly make espresso. However the coffee unit works well. I've never written a review for Amazon before. The poor quality of this product motivated me."
3,Disappointed,The Krups coffeemaker is a nice machine but all its attachments are very cheap - the coffee pot is very cheap the lid doesn't fit correctly it is very poor quality which I did not expect for the price. I like the coffee the machine makes. I enjoy espresso so I like that feature but wish it made slightly larger quantities (very small amounts made and can only fit a tiny cup under the espresso maker). I did expect better and have been disappointed for the price but do enjoy coffee and continue to use it each morning.
1,Do NOT purchase this from BEACH CAMERA,"The machine they shipped did not work from day one...would not hold pressure so it wouldn't make espresso or froth. I contacted Krups and they said it was broken and it should be returned. The Beach Camera rep said to return it via UPS and they would reimburse me for the shipping which was $33.18. After 6 weeks, a dozen e-mails and 4 or 5 phone calls, (the last two telling me that my refund was being processed ""right now""), still no refund rec'd. I'm out $33.18...don't let it happen to you. Do not do business with Beach Camera. There are plenty of other companies offering similar, (and better), products with better Customer Service."
2,Why buy two makers that work if you can buy one that doesn't?,"This item seemed like a great idea, but has been a pain since purchase. It is unnecessarily difficult to program. The espresso maker/steamer is very tempermental and unforgiving. The espresso maker soon failed completely. Coffee maker was fine and it did a good job steaming milk, but don't recommend due to overall poor design."
1,A Very Decorative Paperweight,"I received this product from my wife as a gift about a year ago. Actually really liked the machine once I learned the quirks of using it. We descaled it (both sides) about every 2 weeks and rarely had trouble. Then one day, it just didn't turn on. No lights, no LED, nothing. Just a stainless steel brick.Still have not heard what the issue is from Krups, or how much it will cost to fix. From what I've read and now my own experience, it seems it's just another product from Krups that went to market before it was sufficiently tested."
1,"Electronics broke, carafe replacement took over 2 months!","I bought this combo-machine for my husband's birthday 2 years ago. The electronics were broken within the first 2 months of average use. The lights blink wildly and the espresso side doesn't stop brewing, unless you push the button (which means you have to stand right next to it during brewing). The foaming worked sometimes, sometimes it did not. The plastic cover of the tray that collects the condensed water has peeled off. I'm very disappointed with this purchase. I bought it because I was raised in Germany and know the Krups brand as very reliable and high-quality - unfortunately not with this machine. I'm throwing it away now and recommend either to go for a more expensive machine or for two separate ones (one for coffee, one for espresso)."
2,Ditto,"I must echo all the other negative reviews this machine has recieved.The drip part worked well as most Krups drip makers do, but the espresso maker which is supposed to be the exciting part was a night mare. To put it bluntly it never worked, it would quit midcycle and blink, this behavior was described in another review of another Krups machine so it wasnot a fluke. The supposed great frothing attachmnet flew off twice while steaming, splattering milk everywhere. The lid on the carafe is also very cheap although the filter assembly seems well built that is the best thing I can say about it. I two felt the controls weird and the instructions incorrect and hard to follow. Thankfully Bed bath took this gift back and allowed me to order the Capresso with rave reviews for the same price got my fingers crossed."
1,Do not buy a KRUPS XP2070,"If you buy one of these, the circuit board will go out within a few months. Replacement circuit boards are no longer available so you will end up with a nice-looking, non-functioning, unfixable coffee maker."
3,Eeeh......!,It has all the good tracks of its time but lacks the sound quality that would make this album sound a lot better! Over all its ok but I would recomend save your money on this one.
4,Ah-hah! There's The Hermit Crab!,"The elusive LPS hermit crab, the unicorn in the littlest pet shop world.... AND I HAVE FOUND IT! Now to buy it for my over spoiled child before it's discontinued and the price goes up!"
3,Jakks Elimination Chamber,Lots of pieces. Comes apart easily when played with heavily as my boys did.. Like most toy wrestling cages..not the greatest
1,Annoying,"""Cities"" and ""Lawn"" boy could win an award for most annoying lyrics of the year. Hee hee, those, Phish guys are so funny."
2,Great but Beware,"I,ve been waiting years for this recording to be re-released. It's in my opinion there best album since Spooky Two. With veteran originals Gary Wright and Mike Harrison the vocals are really at there best. Mick Jones from the band Foreigner is with them on guitar and his musical influence is definitely felt. There's no writing credits on the sleeve and I no longer have the vinyl version but I remember that Jones helped on the writing. There isn't a bad song on the album.Here's where the bummer comes in. The sound is of bootlegquality. There's PLENTY of distortion. On two songs ""This time around"" and ""Holy Water"" the distortion really ruins the pleasure of listening to these great tunes. The album was put out on a German label called Progressive Line not the Edsel label which did a great job of remastering the other imports that I got of the Tooth. Still it's great to have and it's very listenable, just be ready to cringe from time to time."
4,Characters bent on Self-Destruction,This is a well-written psychological drama about life's losers bent on self-destruction and self-annihilation through the use of drugs and alcohol. Many deal with personal demons. The people are strange and they find themselves in weird situations.Johnson's language is very captivating.
3,Tuned to dispair,"Let me start by saying that Johnson is a phenomonal writer. I read this about a year ago and look forward to reading his other works and also this one again even though 'Angels' left me depressed. Despite the subtle humor, the hopelessness of the characters and the poor choices that they make wrap a dark cloud around the story. This is a very inventive and realistic novel but full of despair. I can see Johnson's influence in an emerging new crop of shock-lit writers such as JT Leroy. Close the blinds, get back under the covers and take a break from sanity for a few days."
5,Hallucinagenic Reality,"Johnson's compact masterpiece takes us into the land of America's dispossessed bastard children and the power of poetic beauty which comprises the small and great moments of their lives. What also impressed me was how believable all of these eclectic characters from nomadic mother, child serial killer, streetside scavengers, a religious fanatic, and good old fashioned American outlaws. Even more remarkable is Johnson's ability to segway from gritty realism into inspired poetry that brings to light the lost angellic souls that populate the American wastelands, shedding their wouded beauty upon pages, illuminating many truths."
4,Haunting odyssey,"Denis Johnson has already proven himself to be among the premier contemporary authors in America with books such as ""Fiskadoro"" and ""Jesus's son"". But ""Angels"" ranks among his most disturbing of works so far.. he follows the journey of two lost souls across america fleeing pain that neither can understand, let alone overcome. The most striking thing about this novel, though, is Johnson's visionary prose. Johnson reaches levels of gaudy lyricism hardly approached by any contemporary author. Johnson transforms the highest levels of pain into strange, schitzophrenic passages that are all the more disturbing for being on a printed page. Not a book for the weak-hearted, but worthy none the less"
5,A One-Sitting Wonder,"Sheldon Currie has nailed this book, this character, the essense of the highs and lows of life, and the pain of love, and of loss.I read this book in one sitting. I couldn't put it down. By the end you'll be one with the characters, and the setting will be a place you know, or have known, all to well in your own life.The movie, Margaret's Museum, is also great, and definetely a buyer.If you've ever wanted a book to fill that little space you have in your schedule, the bigger place you have in your heart, this is your book."
3,"It was okay, a little boring","Although the book was well written, it was a bit slow. The plot was good and interesting, it just lacked excitement"
5,Intensely Talented with Depth and Skill Level,"This second masterpiece by Norma Jarrett - is Norma on a whole new level - this is Norma depicting another layer of her intense talent - It takes an extremely talented writer of profound creativity to do what Norma has done with this piece of work...she has shown between her two books, Sunday Brunch and Sweet Magnolia, that she is vast in depth and skill level; therefore not limited in her writing sytle and audience. If Norma is still growing as a writer (which I'm sure she is as she should be) then, my, my I am sitting on the edge of my seat waiting for her next release!"
5,The Best Book EvER!!,"It all starts when the kings champion, dalveen leandor, goes on a quest to recover the book of shadows in order to stop the evil sorceror avoch-dar. along the way he meets shani, a knife-thrower with spunk, craigo meath, a mercenary, tycho, a made being with strength and mind power and many more who aid him on his way through the perils of zenobia to recover the book. a definate must-read. Shani Rules!!"
4,Trading Card pages,The box of 100 pages was a good value for the money. My grandson was very happy with the purchase.
5,Great Product!,"Great for coupons! Very durable, and have no doubt it will last me a very long time! Shipping was so fast, all my coupons were barely cut when it came."
5,Just Right!,"Bought these for my coupons, they are nice durable plastic sheets, heavy duty, worth the money.Theyre overall a 5I recommend them!"
5,Great for the price!,The card pages are sturdy and easy to get into a 3-ring binder. I thought the inserts were a wonderful value. So far all my cards fit and look great.
5,Great reliable product.,"If you're looking for a product to safely store your trading cards in, these are for you. Couldn't imagine not having this product to show off my collection."
3,Rear Mounted Spare-Forget It,Great concept. Adjusts quick and easy.Will not work with rear mounted spare. I wasted my money because I did not anticipate this.
3,Not quite all that can be said about the movie,"I was a little disappointed that out of a 245-page book on the making of Gone With The Wind, only 15 pages contained color illustrations. Although the black and white photographs are plentiful and good, I just expected many more color shots.On the plus side, Mr. Bridges writes smoothly and all the facts and facets of the nearly four-years-in-making of GWTW are fully set forth. It was interesting to see the covers of the foreign versions of the novel GWTW, and illustrations from the foreign versions.Bottom line is the book is good, but I wouldn't call it THE definitive book on the history of the film of Gone With The Wind.If the reader can find it, DAVID O. SELZNICK'S HOLLYWOOD, a huge book, has an excellent section on the making of GWTW, profusely illustrated in color, with all kinds of background information, for example, on all the actresses considered to play Scarlett (with photographs of their screen tests)."
4,Why didn't these guys get big?,"White Witch is one of many hard rock bands (acid rock?) from the 70s that didn't get nearly as big as they deserved to be. Unlike many of their peers, they used a lot of tones and textures making a diverse blend of music.As for the lyrics, well they are for the most part VERY 70s with songs like It's So Nice To Be Stoned (done ragtime) and Home Grown Girl, among others. Lot's of songs to get high to. When I was a young teen and first heard them (in the early 80s, I was VERY young when this album first came out) I thought it was great. Bands singing about drug use. Imagine that, lol.Same with the artwork, you'd look at the album cover and think, wow, we got 5 stoned unwashed hippies sporting makeup here, but then you listen to the music and it will change your mind. Never judge a book by it's cover.These guys can rock hard, or space you out. They were almost ahead of their time. How many bands used double bass parts in 72? Or metal SCREAMING? Then got m-e-l-l-o-w?"
5,Top ten favorite of mine!,"It seems so long ago when I first heard this album, and now when I hear it the memories flood back to a time when I was in ""HIGH"" school. So glad it was re-released! The music is quite extraordinary. I find it flows from one song to the next like no other album I've heard. The vast array of instruments (synthesizers?) being used is unusual in todays times... though back in the '70's the synthesizer seemed to be a groups #1 tool. The vocalist is absolutely fabulous... possibly the best I have ever heard. I find the lyrics very true to the era... yet now even more than 20 yrs. later, I can still enjoy this album as much or moreso than when I first heard it. For those of you who may be skeptical... try it...I believe you will like it!"
2,Sophmore Slump,"I bought this CD Today, and was happy that I did received the bonus ""Suspicious Minds"" cover CD. However, there were only a few songs that I liked the first time through on the new album. I consider ""Musicforthemorningafter"" one of my all time favorite CD's, and can listen to it over and over. I actually wasn't such a fan of the album my first time through, either, however I knew I absolutely loved ""Strange Condition"" and ""Life on a Chain"". With this latest effort, however, I feel that there is not any song, save, well save nothing, there is nary a song that is destined to be great, unfortunately. I do like PY's style, and can only hope that the next album can measure up to the first. But then again, he isn't Eddie Veddar!"
5,"Great Album, despite the ""experts""","I am suprised to read all the negitive reviews on this album - while I am not a die hard Pete Yorn fan, I really really liked this album. I liked his first album, but I feel that this is a stronger effort. Don't be swayed by the negitive reviews, this is one of the better albums so far from 2003."
2,Disappointing Sophomore,"Pete's debut MusicForTheMorningAfter was absolutely brilliant. From start to finish, it's impossible to get sick of.After much anticipation patiently awaiting Mr. Yorn's ""oh-so important"" sophomore release, unfortunately Day I Forgot does not come close to having the same impact as MFTMA. Not all is bad on this album but I find myself skipping through a majority of weaker songs to get to better ones, which is quite the contrary on MFTMA.Not much lasting power on this one."
2,Oh Pete.,"This album is disappointing. The first two songs are fine and then it's all downhill from there. I have listened to this album a few times, but it has never really caught my attention. His first album was much memorable. What is up with the song about the burrito? Lyrically this is pretty bloody awful. The blush is off for me. The honeymoon is over."
3,Very Average,"I was pretty surprised at all the ho-hum reviews this album was getting, but after picking it up at lunch I understand why. This falls way short of his first one. There are some good tunes sprinkled in, but it seems to me he tried to make something that more of the ""general public"" could digest instead of just writing really good songs. MusicfortheMorningAfter is still one of my favorite albums in recent memory though."
3,"Not as good as ""Morning"" but still pretty good.","Pete Yorn's second major album holds some MAJOR similarities to his debut, ""musicforhtemorningafter"". While the angst has been watered down a bit, and there seem to be a few more of the upbeat footstompers that were less than half of the first disc (and therefore render this one a little more radio-friendly, a little less memorable), it's still a good listen.Not as deep, not as profound, but not as bad as some have said.I particularly like ""Come Back Home"", ""Long Way Down"", and the somber ""All At Once""."
5,the beginning...,"My dad brought this home in the spring of my sophomore year in hs. Everytime I hear it it takes me back to a very special time in my life. My first experience with both Grover and Bob James...classic. Worth owning; cool, peaceful, hip...cat could play."
2,Alan Jackson,Got this for wifes' b-day. Video quality a big disappointment. Looked more like a VHS tape than a dvd. I don't know if it was because of the technology back then or what.
4,Older but goodies......,"Older videos with clips of award shows, good ,but could be better..... more current video hits would help...but still Alan Jackson"
2,Not very elegant,Digital photography is all about color. Why would any publisher release a book on the manipulation of color images in Photoshop with mostly black and white examples?Save your money
1,Too Complicated For Little Ones,"These blocks are truly disappointing for a Baby Einstein item. The age rating on this item lists 6 months, but most of the adults that have looked at this item have trouble figuring them out. You have to line up the pictures perfectly and push hard in order to make the music start. And since only one block plays the music, it is confusing to my little one why he can't set off the music by putting two of the other blocks together. Plus, the stickers on the blocks are coming off already and we have only had them 2 months and rarely play with them. I recommend staying away from this product."
2,Two stars for 4 wheels-o-steel,"This CD is mediocre. The mixing is pretty good, but the song selection is bad. The scratching is something that more and more DJs are putting on breakbeat albums, and it seems out of place with all of these...trax. The only two tracks that are worth checking out are DJ Volume's ""Ride the Funk"" and 321 Crew's ""E-F-F-E-C-T"". Both have good basslines and quick beats, just find them on something else. I guess it must have been DJ Friction selecting the songs on this because DJ Spice's ""Breaks are Delicious"" CD is awesome(checkout my review on it). If you liked this review don't forget to vote. THANKS!"
3,so-so,"I was really hopeing for some multi-player action which would have made this gime 100 times better... Other than that its just another run of the mill adventure game, you really have to be a fan to like this game."
2,Not Great,"I purchased this case for a wooden recorder, and will probably replace it as it is such a tight fit that I am afraid the zipper will scratch the finish of the wood."
1,"One Month to Fix ""Programming Errors"", according to Mfr.","This thing is very disappointing. It skips like crazy, turns off at random moments, and is really not Ultra thin. I chose this specific model because of the FM tuner, but it doesn't work at all. Once I FINALLY got a hold of a tech support person at sonic blue (after being on hold twice for over 1/2 hour), I was told that there is a programming error with this model, and they might have a fix for it in about a MONTH. Forget it. Sending it back for a refund. :("
2,I don't think Rio's very good...,"The first time they sent me this player, it didn't recognize any discs, so I sent it back. The new one worked, though it skipped a lot on audio CDs that are older than 2000 AD, and doesn't recognize Fujifilm CD-Rs for some unknown reason... Then a year later the second one stopped recognizing discs. I'm just getting another brand.This unit had lots of cool features for a good price, but unfortunately the performance wasn't as good quality. Now the player is only good for charging the batteries that only it uses."
1,Skip city,The only thing I like about this is the remote other than that the product just get 1 star. It skips a lot on both type of CD audio and MP3. The radio reception is also bad. If you are thinking of doing sport this is not the one for you. This is my second and last time buying from RioVolt.
1,I am so sad,Today I received my sp350 and it only worked me for 3 minutes. I live in Costa Rica and I don't know like the amazon guarantee works for my country. I am disappointed of the product and I want to know if somebody can help me with the application of the guarantee.
2,Disappointed.,"I already have an SP250 and an Iriver Slimx iMP-350. I bought this SP350 because of the 32 minute shock buffer. The player I got was skipping songs constantly. Called the online store to get a replacement. The replacement seems to work, but it skips songs still unlike the other two MP3-CD players(which never skip). First of all, I am disappointed in the review that [Amazon.com] gave because it says that you can use AA batteries. There is no external battery case to use AA batteries like the iMP-350(Sonicblue might sell it as an accessory later). This player does not always recognize my MP3-CDs like the SP250 and iMP-350. The only good thing is the sound quality is the best out of all 3 MP3-CD players. The rechargeable batteries that did come with the player take 6 hours to recharge. I currently have my own NIMH batteries and a 1 hour charger that I cannot use with this player. Sound quality is the only good thing about this player. Way overpriced and not worth the [$] retail price."
1,"TryHarder? It may look the part, but RioVolt; Keep Dreaming!","All I have to say is this is the worst player ever! My MP3 cd player kept on skipping and having a rough time playing cd music. I didn't even bother of keeping it, I just throwed it outside my window into my trash can. There is way too much negative description for this player and it is way too much that I am not going to list them.RioVolt, if you want to try to make a better innovation for the community, then I suggest you to fix up this RioVolt SP350. Stop ripping off people money and start fixing up this MP3 CD player!"
1,Very Disappointing,"The tremendous drop on its price explains why I said that this product was a disaster. It skips a lot and there's bugs on LCD, bascilly it does not do its main job, to produce high quality music.I am really sorry for this product, although I think the design is very nice. I wonder why RioVolt would release such product, they are losing their customers' trust."
5,Great Book,This book gives very good details on how to do things and shows you to. Very well writen and the pictures are great. Makes wiring a home very easy.
4,great,soooo sexy. You man would love this outfit. Bodystockings are the only way to go for me. Cheap and the look good.
2,Meh,This didn't fit me like the picture. I'd have to lose 40 pounds to have this look nice on me. (which is a goal)It's also not as soft as I'd had imagined. I could see it chaffing certain sensitive areas on the bosom.
3,Step by Step Microsoft Outlook 2000,"When using the CD with the practice files, it disabled my NIC making Ethernet access to the internet application inopperative.Knocked out my ""shared printer"" with others on the Network. I amnot happy with Microsoft. They need to make their software compatible with all other applications. This CD also does NOT havea removal feature. I lost 4 hours trying to get my system back upand running again!The book is informative. Good tool."
1,Thr poorest book I have ever read!!!,This is the pooest book I have ever read. You don't know what the author is triing to clarify. All the equatios seem to have jumped out without any derivation. The author lacks stern mathematic fundamentals.
1,Doesn't Stack Up,"This text is definately not for new programmers, but even seasoned programmers will be lost in space. The author takes a very simple approach to some topics, and then quickly goes into examples that do not make sense and have no meaningful explanation (if any explanation at all). I have read texts on Object Oriented programming and C++, and this one fails to unite the two in any meaningful way. There is a healthy sampling of exercises at the end of each chapter, but I could not find the solutions anywhere online. I emailed the author and asked where I could get the solutions, and he graciously replied. Unfortunately, he sent only a short message that said there were no solutions. Did he mean the exercises are unsolvable or that the published solutions are not available? This response sums up the content of this book. I suggest looking elsewhere."
3,an odd approach to a complex topic,"I bought this book after reading Pohl's ""C++ for C programmers"" and found it to simply be a beefed up version of the same book without the part about the C kernel language. Pohl has an odd way of approaching the complex topic of C++ and writes in a manner which is at the opposite end of the spectrum from the ""C++ for Dummies"" type books (I read & liked C++ for dummies). I was forced to buy and read other books on the same subject in order to fully appreciate the language, but this book is not without its merits."
3,"Very odd code examples, with many mistakes","I did not buy this book. I borrowed it from my co-worker.After reading upon to page 7, I feel like this is a very odd book on C++. I am a intermediate C++ programmer.On page 4, hello.cpp, it did not compile on my Visual C++ compile. I do not see any merits of using that weird style to code simple ""hello world"".On page 7, the author declared a member function void assign (const char *st), but he never defined it! Yet, he gave the output.How come this is a 2nd edition? Strange."
5,An amazing album...,"Colors of the Year is just a superb album. I'd agree with the references listed above, maybe even a little Everly Brothers too. Just a damn solid disc from beginning to end. I'm highly impressed."
5,Nice End to a Great Series,"Truth be told, I thought the first book in this series was pretty boring. However, the second book got slightly better, the third better still, and so forth. The fifth book definitely continued that trend. It was very slow going in the beginning of the series, but by the time this book comes about, you've had a chance as a reader to get to know the characters and learn to love them, and their faults."
3,Arrived danaged,"This item arrived today and when I took it out of the box, the second hand was broken off and floating loose in the clock face area. It's very disappointing. I use a second hand on a clock to quickly verify that it is working. Other than this, the clock looks good and will be useful on my wall."
3,does its work,"This clock works quite nicely. it is large and not at all stylish. the minus is that is made mostly from plastic and looks rather cheap but who cares? as far as I can read the time accurately, its all that mattters."
2,Cheaply made with loud ticking sound every second,The good:+ It has great contrast with black letterings on white which makes reading the time very easy.The bad:- Cheaply made with flimsy plastic that rattles- Loud ticking sound every second which can be very annoying
3,It's not nuclear physics,"It's just a simple analog clock, battery run with one AA. It does what it's supposed to so far. It's easy to read the numerals. It has no cutesy frills I wouldn't have wanted.A problem I have with all this cheap Chinese stuff is the packaging. Probably because the item has to travel so far to get here, the excess packaging required a lot of muscle to remove and the stabilizing plastic thingies on the back made it impossible to get the clock flush with the wall. Here it cast a shadow from our overhead light. The plastic protrusions can be removed, but the screws holding them on would not unscrew with a Phillip's head screwdriver and I didn't have a tool that would work. We finally improvised something, but it was a struggle.I worry about the environmental cost of a. purchasing an item that must be brought from far away and b. the waste of the packaging to keep it secure on the journey."
3,works,"Seems more solid than those $10 wands you buy at big-box stores that have flimsy plastic valves that crack or pop off if you drop them (such as the Melnor watering wand from Home Despot). However, it does lack an on/off squeeze handle which is not easy to discern from the pictures, and you'd think at this price it would have. You can shut off the water flow (and regulate it quite well) with the flow control valve, but you end up leaving the water on as you go from plant to plant and the weeds in between get some water too.The showerhead is at an approximately 60 degree angle from the feed tube which makes some watering around/behind some plants kind of awkward (you have to reach around and bend over, which kind of defeats the purpose of the wand). A straighter angle would be more convenient as you can just ""point and shoot"" water at the area of interest."
3,Some are edits,"While the selections are timeless classics, be warned. 3 of 4 songs I ordered it for, ""Love Has Come Around"", ""Harmony"" and ""Fantasy"", are single edits. At least the Trammps cut is the long version."
3,Best of the B's...,"Like Macalpine and Impelliteri,Vinnie Moore seems to be one of the imitators,rather than one of the originals(Vai,Satriani,Johnson,etc.).A decent effort with some moments of beauty and inspiration ,but one that still pales in comparison with the newest from Satriani or Steve Vai."
3,"Nice bracket, but temporary adhesive useless in summer","The bracket itself is reasonably well-designed, offering enough degrees of freedom in how it can be adjusted. So, it's somewhat useful. However, the adjusting knobs on mine seem to need frequent re-tightening, as the assembly rattles when they loosen. Also, the temporary adhesive pads appear to be pretty useless in summer: the adhesive melts in the sun and the bracket falls off, leaving a gooey mess."
1,Buyer Beware!,"This will be the third time I have tried to post a review of this unacceptably bad album, and I suppose I have been too harsh, because neither of my previous efforts have been posted. Lets keep this one simple. This is not music, plain and simple. I purchased this due to glowing recommendations from other reviewers on this site, and was terribly disappointed. It basically consists of massively distorted (and detuned) guitar and bass monotonously droning on and on for nearly an hour with no coherence, structure, or anything approximating the actual ability to play an instrument. Call it performance art, experimental noise, whatever. It's simply not music."
1,Ruined it,"Alana ruined Ani DiFranco's ""32 Flavors."" I'm a huge Ani fan, and listened to 32 flavors by Alana, and was thoroughly disappointed at how different and... how much worse it was."
2,BAD VERSION OF 32 FLAVORS,"I cannot express how super PISSED i was to hear alana's cover of ani's 32 flavors on the freakin radio. It was chopped up for mainstream listening and if she had any respect for Ani's work she would have never covered the song the way that she did. I only looked her up because I was curious to see who the idiot was that tore up my favorite Ani song. I like her voice, but I have no respect for her work. Get a new manager Alana. Don't cover any more Ani songs...please."
5,un excepcional hallazgo,"...Alana Davis es esa clase de cantante que uno sueña hallar cuando bucea entre nombres desconocidos (para uno). Con una bella voz, un tono suave e intimista de interpretar sus propias canciones, que tienen mucho de balada con blues, jazz y soul. Una cadencia ritmica comun que nos envuelve al igual que su voz misma. No hay en este album una cancion que no merezca ser escuchada y atesorada. Aun no puedo creer que esta mujer a los 20 y tantos años haya podido lograr tan soberbio trabajo musical en composicion e interpretacion...."
5,"beautifully played, wonderful and overlooked pieces","This set is a remarkable value. Yes, you could choose some individual performances of certain works that are better, but for the price, this is a remarkable set. Ashkenazy is sympathetic to these wonderful and often overlooked solo piano compositions. Highly recommended."
5,Very handy -- assuming this is the version I own.,"Assuming this is the version I own (I can't recall how much I paid for mine, but it was a lot more than $4), this is a very handy board to have for a sewer who does not have a dedicated work room with a cork table top.After laying something like a towel on my dining room table, I open up the board and feel free to use push pins. It's great for tracing and copying paper patterns or changes with a stiletto tracing wheel. I've also used it on a floor with a rug, so I could listen to the TV, although that is less comfortable.It folds up and stores easily."
3,"Strong Idea, Interesting premise.","This is kind of an interesting book for anyone who is really, REALLY interested in all that is mysterious in North America. Unfortunately, I found the book to be too centered on the United States and Canada, with little mention of anything in Mexico. This was quite disappointing, as I had picked up the book in large part to try and find out about some of the Mayan and Aztec sites in the region. Also, many of the entries were far too brief. Sometimes the lack of information was almost criminal, with little explanation for why the site was included in such a survey. If you are looking for a book that covers all of the US and Canada, this would be a good book. If you require a more in-depth analysis of a SPECIFIC area or type of site, then there are better books out there. I would recommend A Natural History of the Unnatural World for a humorous title (it never takes itself too seriously). This one is one to be left on the shelf for most people."
1,Rubbish,"They sent a T shirt which was completely diffferent to the one I had ordered, admittedly, it was sent quickly, but when I queried the wrong one, they admitted that they didn't have any of the advertised product. I would like a refund, but I shan't hold my breath!"
2,Socks,"Not soft and smooth enough, though lots of socks for not much money. I walk a lot and don't want rubbing, so I won't buy these again."
5,recommend for 9 to 12 year olds,This movie can teach children some life lessons; it was an enjoyable movie I think this movie is recommend for 9 to 12 year olds. Is a nice movie and you will have a good family time with your kids.
3,Good Television Style Movie for Preteens,Both my 8 and 12 year old daughters watched Alice Upside Down with me. We all enjoyed it. The acting was good. The plot was a bit predictable and cliché. It is set in middle school but is appropriate for as young as 8 and probably up to 12 or 13. Alice's Mom had died and that is why she is living with her father and older brother. The relationships focused on are between parent and child and between teacher and student. The relationships between the students are very platonic although there are some minor hints of a boy being cute and a bit of the gossipy teen stuff but not much. This is all treated very lightly. In the end Alice finds her way and everyone is happy.
4,Excellent family film,"There's hundreds (if not thousands) of films aimed at the pre-teen and teen markets that aim to provide a valuable life lesson. This is certainly nothing new. But many of those films also suffer from a distinct lack of anything resembling reality, so the target audience often finds the lessons lost or muddled in between all the flash and fantasy. Not so with this one. The lead performers all look and (more often than not) act ""real"". And with the decent production values and good performances, the message of ""Alice Upside Down"" comes through loud and clear, and rings true.Recommended."
1,VERY BAD PRODUCT - NEVER BUY,"VERY BAD PRODUCT.- I have EN 985e 19"" Flat MonitorDIGUSTING MONITORGEOMETRY IS ALL MESSED UP. I WORK ON 1280 BY 1024 AND MY VERTICAL DISTANCE IS MAXED OUT WITH ATLEAST HALF AN INCH BEFORE THE BORDERS.It always messes up the geometry whenever I restart my computer. I work on GeForce FX 5200 (256 MB AGP) and still this monitor is the most useless product sold in the American markets.I strongly suggest NO ENVISION Monitors.NO WAYNO WAYWasted my money :(Sigh !!"
5,sweeeet!,I've looked at this on the ninja turtles website.It will be awesome to have a physical copy of this.I've been wanting one of these for a while.can't wait to get it.
5,The Bomb!!!!!!!!!,The book was totally off the hook everybody must read this book . It was so good I finish reading the book in one day
5,good,"I basically bought the book for any mechanics/friends that might need to work on my car. I don't personally do the work so a lot of what it talks about is a little foreign to me but as far as the quality, the book was in great condition. I could tell it was used but there was nothing wrong with it."
1,DO NOT BUY THIS IF YOU HAVE A PC!,"DO NOT BUY THIS ADAPTER FOR A PC. While the adapter might be OK the included WIDCOMM software is terrible and the tech support is a joke. After 3 days of trying to get it to work all I can get is ""Incorrect License Type"" and ""Bluetooth stack service could not be started"". I know this is the WIDCOMM software because I had the same problem with the Kensington Bluetooth USB adapter which uses the same WIDCOMM software. One Belkin tech support rep actually told me to format my harddrive and reinstall WindowsXP ?!?!?!? What a joke and he was completely serious. DO NOT BUY THIS PRODUCT! also do not buy the Kensington Bluetooth USB adapter which is even worse. I am a software engineer and have 20 years of PC experience and I have never encountered such a terrible combo of device and software."
1,what is it at all??,"There is no picture, nor a model number for this item. I cant imagine how 700 poeple bought it???"
4,Good Value,This book is a very good summary of this series of WW2 battleships. There is a lot of technical information on the ships combined with quality historical data and good pictures in balance. This is great book at reasonable cost.
1,Waste of money,All this did was make continuous noise in the bathroom. The plug-in from the grocery store was far superior.
1,Not for Every Believer,"This book is not meant for every Christian believer. It's valuable only to those who are members of the church in reference. It provides the historical origin of the organization being referred to. It prescribes doctrines, mandates, and structure for this organization and how it is administered as a corporation. The book could have been better served as a short-run publication provided only to the church's membership and not the general Christian public."
1,What made this album was the mix he had with Billy And 702,Like I said the album was ok but I really dont know the image he is trying to portray. Either he wants to be a thug or he is doing it for the ladies. I was very disapointed when I had gotten the album and to find out that the mix he had with 702 wasnt on the album. Thats one of the reasons why I had got it. What can we look forward to in the next joint. No hard feelings
4,Good Looking cabinet,"The item looks nice and is a good fit but is not as good as the display. The drawers were a pain to put together and most average consumers would have had to return 3 drawers because they were not milled correctly. I am a carpenter so I could repair them without returning. There were also chipped areas on the wood and some of the drawer slots also must have came apart in shipping. Once assembled it is nice, but they need to do a better job at the factory for QC inspection."
4,It's a good start,"I believe this book was very good and set up the series beautifully.This introduces you to the main characters--Gemma and Nathan--who's romance is continous throughout the series, and introduces the insecurities that plague this relationship.The book is also a separate romance from that of Gemma and Nathans. It is interesting to see it unfold because the next book always sums up a previous book--except the first one.I wish the book was still in print because I would snatch it up in a hurry."
2,Not the best of it's genre...,"OK, so Into Eternity are Canadian (lol)... with that in mind, they're good (I guess), but they are so negative. I listen to a lot of metal, and most of it (if not all of it) is negative, but Into Eternity are just trying to fit into the genre, and they are kind of fake. I think that this release would've been awesome without the annoying sing-along style of singing that they embrace to the fullest. The sad part is that on their self titled release, their lead singer sings higher than the chick that is featured in the song... just keep that in mind if you are thinking about buying this CD. I would highly recommend Night in Gales - Nailwork instead of this CD if you want to listen to catchy metal."
5,Unbelieveable!!!,"Just buy it. You won't regret it. The great thing about Into Eternity is that they appeal to such a broad audience. If you like bands like Rush and Dream Theater, you'll like this album. If you like bands like Dio and Iron Maiden, you'll like this album. If you like bands like Death, you'll like this album. Into Eternity creates a monophonic sympony of amazing guitar licks with a hard driving rhythm and indescribable vocals. The lyrical content is creative, and poetically descriptive, leaving the listener in a sea of emotion. I can't say enough good about this album...about this band. I've been a metal fan for year now, and I don't like much of the new stuff that comes out...but these guys are on my top ten list right up there with bands like Van Halen, Ozzy, and Judas Priest."
2,Disappointed with Oliso Iron,"I am an avid sewer & crafter; purchased the most expensive of this line; the iron blew up after 20 days, sent back for replacement which I think all they did was replace the cord & sent back to me; does not steam well or will not get hot. Really disappointed in its performance."
1,It looks better than it works,"This iron is a toy and not practical for everyday ironing.Pros:featuresappearanceCons:poor performancepoor qualitybulkyPoor performance: steam is inconsistent. Although the dial is turned to maximum, the steam burst button spits out more water than steam. Soleplate does not glide over surface like the name implies....they should call it Touch & Drag to be more accurate.Poor quality: it has a very ""plastic"" feel to it, this iron is made in China. Rowenta is made in Germany, and the quality shows!Bulky: It's such a lug! When maneuvering the iron around button areas and along the collar, the iron is so heavy and massive, that it makes it a chore. Smaller lighter-weight irons are much easier to get into the ""tough"" spots than this one."
5,Very handy iron,The iron is awesome. Since I am a quilter I do lots of ironing and this iron is so handy to use. The steam functions are very good.
4,Pretty fun for an iron!,"It took me a little time to get used to not lifting up the iron when you stop ironing, but all in all it made a dull job a little more interesting. And it irons easlily and steam works well. So no complaints, especially for the price - great value."
4,Removing the legs,"I've seen alot of complaints about not being able to remove the legs after assembling them. If you read the instructions, simply remove the water tray. (rotate counter-clockwise) This exposes the metal clips that retain the legs. Pull the clips to disengage the legs and they drop right out! Put the tray back on; put the legs in the tray; and add the grate, grill and lid. Put it in the bag. It's that simple. Nice little grill."
3,mostly great,"We used the grill yesterday; the piezoelectric lighter worked the first two times; the third time it 'gave up the ghost'. luckily, we had some matches. It cooks great, cleans up easily. Just that one little bugaboo."
1,Big Waste of Money,Don't waste your money. I'm taking my recertification exam in March. The layout and more importantly the clinical information provided in the text is useless. The only positive statement I can make is that at least I can use the questions.
5,Very Comprehensive,"This is a fantastic resource. As a fairly new practitioner, this book has really helped me with my approach to my little ones with feeding difficulties. It is very comprehensive- any issue I've had questions about is covered completely. Lots of strategies are offered in excellent detail. I am very pleased with this purchase."
3,"Okay, but...","I was a little disappointed with this book. For one thing, the author gives Luke superhuman powers- whatever happened to the more brash Luke? I can understand growing and maturing in the Force, and all that- but then there's also the slight fact that he seems to regularily do things without effort using the Force, without even pausing to think about it. It gets old, after a while.And Han Solo was totally unlike the character we remember from the movies. Come on, who ever heard of using a Gun of Command just to get someone to go on a space flight to a planet with them?On the other hand, the plot line does have some interesting points, and Teneniel Djo is an interesting character.Nice try, Wolverton. Try to make the characters a little more realistic next time."
2,Star Bores,"Dave Wolverton is an okay author. I read some of his other stuff (this includes other SW short stories he did for the Tales Of series,) and liked them. But it is so obvious that he is in over his head in this one. Take the plot: When Leia goes to marry another man, Han kidnaps her and drags her off to a planet he had won in a card game (!?!,) which turns out to be inhabitted by a race of force-sensitive witches(!?!) who keep Rancors as pets (!?!) and battle more another tribe of witches. Now, is it just me, or is this a little silly? This ultra-politically correct book tries not to insult any minorities, but manages to offend it's majority: the Star Wars fan. Admittly, Wolverton had a hard job, making a novel out of the premise of how Han and Leia wed in the Thrawn trilogy, but Steve Perry had an even harder job with Shadows Of The Empire and he managed to pull it off. Say, I wonder what it would have been like if he had written this..."
2,Not Captivating and Unbelievable,"I will premise this review in saying I could only get through the first 50 pages of this book before I put it down. The characters seem shallow. The love story is boring and unbelievable. After all Leia and Han have been through, the epic love story of the original trilogy, she just will consider leaving him for some strange prince she does not even know? It really quite angered me. I refuse to read a love sory of Han's jealous rash behavior. I wanted to read the books in order after Return of the Jedi so this came shortly after The Truce at Bakura (which was superb). I am not going to finish this book and am going for the Thrawn Trilogy by Tim Zahn instead. I would not recommend this book to someone looking for epic action. It quite frankly seems like a bad romance novel that does not belong in the Star Wars EU. 2 out of 5 only because the author can write well, just a lame storyline."
5,My favorite star wars novel,"Wolverton is a great author. Unlike Zahn's peety little space skirmishes , Wolverton has huge space battles that fit the star wars galaxy better. Zsinj is a true Warlord and has a fleet to back up his claim , unlike Thrawn. Also charecterization is MUCH better than Zahn, [who has created] some very fake, unrealistic charecters. Han Solo , in this book , has a softer side. I espically like the part at the end where liea almost cried because she was so happy. Zsinj is awsome , espically if you read about him in the X-wing series. Gethezerion is scary too. I seriously hope Wolverton wrrites other star wars books. He definetly has a better grip than any other author I know to date."
4,Breath-taking story lots of action !!,"This is a superb book.Luke has to battle witches that control the dark side of the force.They all women but extremely powerful, yet exciting. There's even a part where Luke get... by the witches.I really loved this book I just lent it out to my friend that's how good it is.He's also enjoying.this is the perfect book if your looking to start the star wars novels.This is also exciting because Han takes Leia away from her duties to prevent her from marrying the princ of Hapes.He then takes her to Dathomir a planet he won in a card game.From that point the action starts to heat up.But don't take it from me read ot yourself."
4,One of the better SW novels,"Great!, this book was what you call a nice surprise! I read 'children of the Jedi' just before I bought this novel and man, what a relief to see that great SW novels are still being written! The story never got dull, and the planets, characters and sofort that have been added are all a worthy addition to the Star Wars universe. I do have so critism though. For instance, I really can't believe that Leia would run of with some other guy so easily. And what are the Imperials actually doing exept getting killed? And why do Luke's powers appear to be greater than they were in novels that took place later? But aside from that, a great book, Zahn, Anderson, move over."
4,Great Book should be read by all who like Star Wars.,"This is a great book to read. I laughed when Han said he gloated to the warlord, saying how he blew up his stardestroyer and said something like kiss my wookie. I cryed when Han said goodbye to Leia when he turned himself into the witches, and he was going to blow them up with a grenade, he knew he would not make it out alive, and thought it was going to be the last time he would ever see Leia. You can tell that Luke has turned into a great Jedi, he has learned patience very well. As some people have already pointed out, Wolverton did not know the characters very well. But otherwise, there was a good story line to it."
5,Good book. It abides by the Star Wars theme.,I really enjoyed reading this book. Since Episode 1 was so hyped up everyone forgot about Luke and the characters from the first trilogy. I reccomend this book for anyone who wants to follow up on the story right after The Return of The Jedi. This book really abides by the Star Wars theme. It has a very cinematic quality to it. And the evil witches who are Luke's enemies are pretty scary.
5,SHOULD HAVE BEEN A MOVIE!,"Like the title says ""SHOULD HAVE BEEN A MOVIE"" I just could not put this book down. I read it some time ago, and I finally decided to write about it. Full of Action and Drama. I recommend this book for any true SW fan. ( is there a 6 star rating....?)Darkjedi27@yahoo.com"
1,Save your money,"This book could have been a lot better if the author had managed to keep the characters in character. The major premise of the book is that Princess Leia might marry some guy she's just met in order to seal an alliance between his mother's government and the New Republic. This despite the fact that she's clearly in love with Han Solo. If that doesn't seem bad enough, Han responds to this by kidnapping- kidnapping! -Leia in order to talk some sense into her.I'd really like to give this book half a star, or no stars."
3,so-so,"Its a book you will enjoy reading, but all the while know its no masterpiece.I read it because I was interested in reading more about Han and Leia. On the subject of the famous couple.... Sometimes this book is very touching... And other times you just wished there was some way to reach in a book and slap the characters to get them to think straight. The desperation Han feels over loosing Leia, and the great lengths he takes to make her choose him is sweet. However, Han was made out as uncharacter- isticly whiney and pathetic. And Leia was made out to be snobby and mean on occasions.Regarding Luke... He was irritatingly emotionless. An obvious case of taking the mysterious Jedi Master Image way too far."
5,Awesome way to get Leia and Han together,"This book is an awesome way to tie up the loose ends for Leia and Han. Instead of just getting them married period, they have a huge duel between Isolder and Han. The only problem is that it seems like this book gets lost in the series. Like whatever happened to the Hapans from which the Alliance got a huge amount of help? What happened to all the money they got? What did Luke do with the Chu'Unthor? Other than that, I liked how the witches were able to use the force so well and how they take on the others. I was also impressed with the sacrifice Han was about to make for Leia at the end. This is a great book and I highly recomend it."
4,Easy to install - having a remote is the bomb!,"Installed this to replace an old unit that died. Install took maybe 20 minutes tops. Mounts securely, and connected up easily. Note that batteries are not included - need two AA and 1 9V for the remote.Programming was not that straightforward - needed to use the cheatsheet, but otherwise just fine. Being able to use the remote to turn zone on and off while standing at a particular sprinkler is amazing compared to the old method of turning them on from the garage.Excellent value!The one I received is not the green color in the photo - it was black."
5,The most important albums of my life,"This and Learning Curves, that is. These albums made me hear music in a completely different way. God only knows where I would be right now if it hadn't been for these albums. These albums honestly are the most important in my collection, right up there with Blood on the Tracks and Abbey Road."
2,Real War Rogue States,"I like using the many different units and the somewhat realistic features of the games such as the firy explosions, the booming sounds and the units flying into the air when they are destroyed.What I dont like is the fact that there are obviously some bugs that prevent me from completing the Nuke level in us campaign. This means I can only get to complete less than halfway through the campaigns."
1,Good Idea...................But That's About It,"I'm sorry, that's all I can think of. What begins as a great idea for a novel winds up being not even creepy in an interesting way. One can imagine this writer dreaming of Nabokov while putting this novel together, and unfortunately all of the ambitions of that idea are present here but none of the actual talent or payoff."
1,You've got to be kidding!,"So many books utterly ruined by their endings. Here's another to throw on the pile. It's the last few pages that change it from ""interesting if seriously flawed"" to ""How dare you waste my time like that!"""
2,Not what I expected...,The piece if very nice looking but it doesn't hold very many cd's. I was disappointed and probably would need to order about 4 more of them to fit all my cd's.
1,Monster iLink cable won't work with iPad or iPhone,"The title says it all.. I thought that this would work on my iPad and iPhone given it has the standard Apple pin configuration, but simply can't get this to work with either device."
3,still works but....,although i bought this a while ago ive kept it in good condition and one day i unplugged it and the casing around the input tip to the iPod broke.
1,I wish I could rate it lower,I have the ipod classic and it did not work. Amazon please state that in the description.
2,Quality construction but won't work with Nano 3G,"Monster cable has a very good reputation & previous products I have used were excellent. However, this cord will NOT work with my 3 month old Nano 3G. I followed all instructions on the Ipod & cord to a tee & could never get the cord to work. I finally returned it to AMAZON.com (with very little hassle & excellent service!)& ended up buying the APPLE version (twice the cost, of course)& it worked like a charm. I believe APPLE'S proprietary stance is the main reason the MONSTER cable would not work. Unfortunate, because the monster utilizes a superior S-Video connection, whereas the APPLE is only either rca connectors or component."
3,Bootleg.....,Great night of music with Lemmy & the boys .But this is a bootleg of the TV Broadcast .They even left the TV Station watermark in upper left corner.Still a great show & I'm glad to have it just not at these prices.
1,Misleading,When I placed my order I thought I would be getting the whole set but you only receive one hook which is the companies choice. The add is really deceiving. The only good thing was the quality of the one hook I received was very nice.
2,It's OK,"If I buy another one of these I will spend a little more and get a good one. This one is OK but always switching out of gear for the direction I'm going. Snap On makes the best tools, expensive but worth it."
4,Use as a computer cart,"I purchased this in Target after seeing how sturdy it was in the store. I wanted to able to store my external monitor and keyboard for my laptop in the laundry room and then easily roll it out to the dining room when I had to work from home. It works well, especially for the price, and the hooks even hold the cables out of the way. There's plenty of space for a 17 inch monitor. I'm giving it 4 stars, because I had planned to turn the shelves upside down for the keyboard and misc. storage; however, the tubes on the corners are slightly coned shaped so that when the shelves are installed differently than the picture, the cart is not as sturdy. I decided to be safe and adapt."
4,Great cart for the price.,"When I brought home my new cart, I was elated, until I opened it all up and realized that the company that made the cart sent me two of the same pieces for the legs so I could not put it together. I had to drive back to the store and exchange it much to my dismay. However, once I got home again and put it together, it made me more than happy. It was easy to put together and fits in the smallest of places but yet holds a large microwave. I am very pleased and highly recommend this product, just check the pieces before you take it home!"
4,Perfect for small spaces!!,"It's a really great cart for those without a lot of space. Took about a half hour to put together. Mine doesn't wobble at all. My microwave just fits on it. The shelves seem sturdy and although they tell you not to exceed the recommended weight for items placed atop the shelves, they don't tell you what that weight is. I didn't use the 4 tiny screws that are supposed to screw into the top of the cart. They were too tiny to hold and I don't see why they are really needed as long as you don't ever lift it up by top it should be ok."
1,Too flimsy to hold a microwave,"We bought three of these because we have a large kitchen, one was for the microwave, one was for the toaster oven and the other was for miscellaneous items. We put one of them together and it was so flimsy that we called the 1-800 number and were told to put the trays in ""upside down."" That made no sense at all. When we put the microwave on it the microwave crashed to the floor. I was so angry that I threw that cart away because the entire cart was bent. I called Target and asked them to pick up the other two and they did. This is a very dangerous item and should not be advertised as a microwave cart in my opinion."
1,Designed to frustrate and bewilder,"World's worst design for a cart that is expected to support an object that usually weighs over 25 lbs. I feared for my cat's life, the longevity of my big toe, and the fate of my microwave. DO NOT SUBJECT YOURSELF TO THIS!"
2,kinda boring,"The pets are kinda cute, but this is a really boring Aquapets.They don't really interact with each other or do much."
1,Stupid :(,The minute I got it I was already bored of it. All it does is move and beep. I played with it for a day now it is sitting on my desk. DO NOT WASTE YOUR MONEY!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
1,One redeeming quality,"Thunder in the deep boasts one saving grace. It is so fast-paced, so easy to read, that you don't realize just how bad it is until you've finished reading it. In fact, you might have a good time reading most of it.Once you turn the last page however, you are likely to feel the way you would coming out of Rambo 15. Why did I just read that again?In short, seen from a cool mind, the book has nothing (past that quick fighting pace) going for it. Characters and settings are inexistant as an integral part of the story. The plot is so bloated with holes and miraculous apparitions saving the day that you'd think Reggie White just went down the buffet line.If you really have nothing else to read, this won't take long and you may not throw up. Otherwise, pass..."
2,Incredible - truly unbelievable,"What a disappointment. Great theme and an accomplished writer combine to produce this fantasy of multi-nuclear explosions in the deep, where the odd few thousand casualties at each detonation is commonplace, except that our hero somehow manages to avoid annihilation on eleven different occasions. A series of unexplained,unbelievable,neo-political military scenarios spoil the book for me."
5,"""Going Deep""","Thunder In the Deep by Joe Buff is a fasinating fast pased undersea military techno thriller.The is the second installment of the WWIII battle started by the new axis powers of South Africa and Germany. In this installment France has fallen,the British are starving and the world's hopes are pinned on U.S.military. The charecters are vividly portrayed and the plot brilliantly carried out.The action level is high and the weapons high tech and very interesting.This novel makes one realize war is no joke. It also makes me glad this one is only within the pages of this novel.Kudos once again to Joe Buff who keeps me wating for each new book."
1,This will only work for a year at best,"This product only lasted one year for me before it malfunctioned and quite working. Despite two new sets of batteries freshly purchased, the solenoid will not engage and turn the water on; the unit has now has the low battery indicator permanently on. I agree with other reviewers that this product is difficult and confusing to program. Orbit has other products that are much easier to program, but alas they don't even last a year. Cheap products made overseas, but priced at top dollar. Got to love them red state values."
3,"Nice read, could use more concrete lessons","As an English teacher, this was a useful read. The chapters were short, and there were nice teaching suggestions at the end of the chapters. However, I would have liked to have seen more concrete lesson plans and blackline masters. I had to read this book for a class, but I will definitely hang on to it as an instructional resource."
2,uneven heating,"I was so excited about this pan but it just doesn't heat evenly, at least not on my flat-top stove. I have other Lodge products that I love so not sure why the heat isn't dispersing. Maybe it works better on other range styles. I ended up getting the 10 in round grill pan and the 10 in round griddle to replace this. Both of those work great."
3,good product,"i love that this fits over one burner... perfect for one or two. only complaint... i have arthritis, and it is so heavy."
3,In the memory of Giorgos Papasideris + Georgia Mittaki,I think together with our musical knowledge we should investigate and respect peoples's originsPlease make note that Gíorgos Papasideris + Georgia Mittaki were not of Albanian descendanttheir great grandfathers were Greeks that migrated from Epirus now in Albania.

1,sucks,"It's too rough and doesn't produce foam like other pairs of exfoliating shower gloves do. Additionally, the color shown is not the color I received. I reported this to the seller with no response. The color I got was a feminine sea-green."
4,SERVICABLE BATH GLOVES,"Gloves are nice and serviceable; do work as advertised. Only complaint, is that a small hole has started in one after 2 months use. However, I am a slightly over zealous scrubber so your mileage may vary."
5,Fear not to order this Masterpiece!,"I have heard some criticism of Cambridge tampering with the spellings and capitalization within the text of the King James in the 21st Century printings. I have many of their most collectable and also this exact edition. THERE IS NO SUCH TAMPERING. This beautiful wide-margin Bible is magnificently bound with impeccable attention to detail. Cambridge continues to be the Monarch of high quality King James publishers. If they had the rights to the ""Scofield"" study system there would be no contest at all from Oxford Press. It is a very valuable and useable Bible. Stunning craftsmanship. Cambridge has excellent customer service too. You'll pause with breathless delight when you first open the functional protective case and your eyes inspect eagerly, this handsome goatskin volume. HIGHLY RECOMMENDED!"
2,Ugh...,"This book is torture. Not only that, there are grammatical errors and badly written sentences. And you're using this to teach your students? Also, he insinuates that the Native Americans weren't civilized because they hadn't invented the wheel- I found that offensive."
2,Someone needs a ruler.,"I ordered this because it was advertised as 4 1/2 inches. It was actually only 4, so I had to use the leftover mix in a separate container. Not sure how to trim off 1/9th of an egg etc. 8P"
5,"Florida Firearms Law, Use & Ownership (2009)","Outstanding book!I understand why so may people in-the-business recommend this book.While ""Billed"" as a FLORIDA information book, I think any gun owner would benefit from this easy read.Important to get MOST recent edition as laws are always changing"
5,"Wonderful, I couldn't put it down.","I picked up Dream Man for something to read, and couldn't stop reading until I had finished it. Then I read it again, because I wanted to go back and savor each page. The descriptive writing while at times very graphic (rape, murder, torture, etc.), was so well done, it was like watching a movie, you could visualize the scenes clearly. Linda Howard did an excellent job, Dane is soooo fine, he is a real DREAM MAN. GREAT BOOK LINDA."
5,One of Howard's best [and she has plenty of good ones],"I have read all of Ms. Howard's books and I have fallen in love with all but one. This is one of her best, in my opinion. A psychic with a traumatic past recovers her abilities due to a gruesome murder and meets an esceptic cop whom immediately suspects her as accomplice to the crime. From there, these characters grow to love each other and solve a series of murders spanning a decade and many states. I love the main characters, I love the plot and I plainly love the way Ms. Howard writes. It is obvious to me that she does a fair amount of research on the background of her characters and what legal or whatever issues are of importance to the development of the story. Many of her secondary characters fairly beg for their own stories [Hint: PLEASE write about Alejandro Trammell!]. There is also enough humor, both subtle and obvious, to balance the blood and gore of the darker scenes. This is a book for one sitting, impossible to put down."
2,Dissappointing,"I bought this book based on the reviews here -- wow was I dissappointed! It is so unrealistic it is amazing. And the ""dream man"" was an evil killer. Choose another Linda Howard book -- this one isn't worth it."
2,Dietary advice very misleading!,"Although this book explains the difference between soluble/insoluble fiber, it recommends people with IBS load up on the insoluble type through All-Bran or whole wheat. This is dangerous advice! The nutritionist also dismisses soluble fiber sources like oatmeal as being unable to help regulate IBS, which is completely backwards. In the end this book was not worth buying."
1,CRAP!,"DOES NOT WORK. It's NOT the computer because we tried three different ones, and the disc loads...partially, then stops and there is an error on the screen which says it is not a legal copy!I HAVE BEEN RIPPED OFF ROYALLY!WHAT CHEATS! I'll NEVER buy another thing from amazon.comI can't believe you would sell bootleg discs!"
4,Its a good Semi Trucking Game,"I do like the SEMI Games all from Wheels of Steel. The thing is, is that it doesnt have a loud jake-brake like in the trailors and when i recieved it, it was only the disc without the book for intructions."
4,Fun but gets old,This game is fun for the first month or two then it really starts to get old. I have made Millions and have 4 millionin my pocket in the game and it just gets boring. Another great thing to do is in single delivery forget about your trailer and road rage!! :) :)
2,Not recommended for 17inch laptop,"The bag seemed to be well made, but was not big enough for my 17 inch dell laptop. The top of the laptop stuck up above the padding."
1,left wing lies,"the authors of this book appear to villify the police for every one of these killings when anyone with a half a brain knows that the vast, vast majority of those killed were violent thugs entirely responsible for theyre own deaths."
4,Great book,"Big fan of this book. Interesting way of approaching family and commitment. Explains the new hipster experience, I suppose. Very quick read in comparison to Richard Florida's ""Creative Class."""
3,Charming but flawed,"I must first say that I was charmed by this book, and my two-year-old absolutely adores it. The illustrations are beautiful and the story is clever.That being said, I was disappointed by the lack of editing of the text, a fault probably more closely related to the publishers than the author himself. Namely, the text has severe tense problems; it jumps several times between the past and present tenses with no logical transition. One example:""It spends each day just being blue.Until one day, this day in fact,The big blue spot thought of something it lacked.It opens its eyes...""There is also a problem with the fact that the big blue spot is an ""it"" while the big yellow spot is a ""she"".I understand this is all a bit nitpicky, but it should have been caught; I'm not an editor, just a parent, and I think our children suffer for the lack of quality editing in children's books."
3,Not the best by far,I am at a loss by the great reviews for this book? What am I missing? The writing is amateurish. I did not feel for the birth mother or the adoptive parents and I really did not care what happened to any of them. It dragged on and on with no real meaning or feeling. This is just words and more words. I kept thinking of plot lines that would have made this novel great and hoping they would happen but they never appeared. This is just not worth the hype of the good reviews.
4,great book...unable to put it down,"I have started reading even though I am not done with this yet, I love the book. I have not been able to put it down. It gets good right from the start of the first paragraph."
1,A very bad taste,"I can't believe anyone gave this book a good review. What is it you enjoyed? The Repetitious dialog? She keep saying the same thing over & over. Like I was to stupid to understand it the first time. After the first time Stella disappeared I would not be concerned on the 2nd & 3rd times. What was up with the cat, & the dog that died. Was I supose to cry over a dog that I never got to know? I always try to find something redeming in a book, after all I am not a writer. But if this is all it takes to write a book, maybe I will try it. I could not even care for the characters they were so flat. I only finished it to see if it got better. which it did not & I was stuck with only this book on my MP3 player while walking."
3,"Ok, but nothing special","The game is different. Based on destruction and the better you are at it, the better you do in the game. Graphics are poor. Game play is just ok. Something to do for a day."
1,Poor copy - fire sale?,"I love the old Topper movies and kinda remember seeing reruns of the series many years ago on tv.The first thing I noticed was the strong odor, smelled like the DVD I purchased via Amazon's Gold Box was salvage from a warehouse fire. The quality of the video overall was extremely poor, looked like those old extended play VHS videos, with many sound dropouts. The first episode didn't even play all the way through - the DVD may be damaged, although it looks OK. I tried it in 3 different DVD players. The menu options didn't work correctly either, took a lot of playing around to get it to another episode.Overall I was disappointed, the show was not too bad, the Camel commercials were amusing but the quality of the DVD made this purchase a very poor decision. Yes , I could probably return it, but the costs of returning it and the hassle of getting a correction far outweighs the cost of the original DVD - next time I will be more careful."
1,Don't buy it for DVD backup/copy,"I am really dissapointed with this.This unit doesn't work with dvd recorders just with dvd to vhs recordings.It creates an electronic protection even when the original doesn't have it.Just lets you copy dvd to vhs, don't expect any more."
5,Just Could'nt Put It Down!!,"I promise once I started reading this book I couldnt stop!!I read white lines and that book was beyond fantastic so I knew I had to go back and purchase another book by her and this one was great to. It was awful the way Kaia's family treated her for no reason, especially her own mother. i just dont understand how someone could be so cruel to their own flesh and blood thats exactly why she was so lonely and miserable.But I was also happy that she met a nice and caring guy like Aaron, that boy loved her to death and i was so dissappointed when she betrayed him, that was real stupid of her anyway common sense would have told her to leave that situation along cause i believe if it wasnt for Giselle it would have gotten back to him some other way. But home girl was wrong though and had that beatdown coming to her!!Im glad every thing worked out in the end and felt bad for what happened to Symphany she was a true friend!"
3,The device works well.,The device is good for what it does. It is priced right and we are happy with it. It has a few insignificant drawbacks in that it has to be anchored by a strap rather than a simple hole in the ground and the strap is annoying to have to step over. It performs well.
3,knitting,this book may have step by step stuff in it but they are very hard to do. i would not buy this book again.
1,Wonderful kids,"Have not started using this book, since I have too many projects going at this time. Have it in my library"
2,I thought I'd love it but I was wrong,"I really looked forward to this book.I thought I'd enjoy the humour in it as well as learn a few things.Essentially I find the general attitude of the author as very negative....the author must've really hated finding out she was pregnant/being pregnant and then having the baby.There are a few giggly bits in it but certainly nothing to rave about.As for information it's sparse, most of what it contains I've gotten from my monthly pregnancy magazine subscription."
4,"Black, White, and Jewish","The title of this book caught my attention.Although I am not mixed,I very well may someday have a mixed child.I found this book very interesting,the times she was growing up were the same time period I was growing up.I knew all the songs she wroteabout and all the cool clicks of kids in Riverdale she hung with.I feel like Ms.Walker could very well be a good friend of mine.I too grow up in Westchester but as a Italian American.But I feel like the ending was a disapointment,like when did she meet her ""Partner""?I want to know more!!I hope Ms.Walker blesses us with more books!Maybe a second diary of her early 20's!!???"
1,poorly written,This book was hard for me to read. I actually didn't end up finishing it because I thought it wasn't that well written.
4,INSIGHTFUL AND HONEST,"This was a story full of honest, uncensored introspection. As a fellow bi-racial American woman, I was completely able to relate to her experiences. Although her circumstances were unique, her inner struggles and identity issues resonated with me in a very real way. Not once while reading this book did I feel that something was being kept from me. Her truth was bracing and appreciated. Whatever her motives were for writing this book, she was able to sincerely touch and affect this reader. I would recommend this book to anyone who has ever struggled to find the essence of who they are, all the while pretending to already know."
2,completely forgettable,"Given the slants on the traditional coming-of-age story, I was astounded at how boring and shallow this book was. After 50 pages, I no longer cared what brand of jeans Walker was wearing, what color her current boyfriend/best friend was, or what drugs she was taking at the time of their relationship. Her teenage escapades blurred together because not a single character was developed and explored. Nor were Walker's feelings of ambivalence other than a few token tries thrown in here and there. She goes from someone who apparently did anything to fit in to a high school senior militantly proud of her African American identity. And we are glad she has apparently resolved some major issues. However we are left with absolutely no clue as to why. In the end, I couldn't figure out if I was missing something or if there was simply nothing to miss."
2,Not what it seems,"Large, bulky, awkward and rides to low. The actual ""holster"" part of the rig is secured by your belt. Unless your wearing a Parka there is no concealing the weapon.If your looking to carry an 8"" 44 mag bear hunting then this may be the rig for you, but for us city folk, no thanks!I don't even think that this is a good deal for the cheap price. I can't recommend it at all."
3,characters too modern,"It's well plotted, with likeable characters. However, the sensibility of the characters is 'way too modern to be authentic, and the idea that a Roman senator's daughter would *ever* consider marrying a plebe is too ludicrous for me to take seriously. Maybe I'm too picky, but I like historical fiction to be accurate--or it's just modern mystery dressed up in togas."
1,-,"i think this product would be great, but wasn't able to use it becasue the description of it on this website and on phiolosphy's website does't give you one tiny bit of information. the very last step, the very last sentence says that you shouldn't use this product if you are prone to breakouts because this will cause a severe breakout. the reason i bought this was to clear up my face, so it would have been nice to know this before i am about to apply it to my skin."
1,Leaking Air Gap,This thing leaked a lot so the plumber's only option was to bypass it and go directly to the drain. More trouble than it's worth to send back so I just tossed it in the trash.
4,Danze Air gap for dish washer,The product works well and looks nice. I ordered two and was shipped one at a time. The two were different and did not match. They had the same part number but were definitely different in size and appearance. Must have changed them with newer date of manufacture. The vendor was very good about sending me two new ones that matched.
2,Need More Information,Save your money and talk with someone who has been to law school. I continually found myself wanting more information. It would probably be worth it to spend a little more money and buy a book with more details and advice.
3,tdk mini disc 10 pack,"i ordered the 10 pack and was expecting the storage box, but was sent the 80 discs instead without the box. decided to keep the 80 minute ones anyway."
5,The Journal Wheel,"I use the Journal Wheel when the best I can come up with to write in my journal is ""mowed the lawn"" or ""took a walk."" (I'm sure you know what I'm talking about.) The Journal Wheel gives me the jump start I need. Plus it's fun and easy-to-use. This is a great tool for writers AND teachers."
5,Beautiful,"I've read the Black Jewels Trilogy and the Invisible Ring. I loved that series.However, it was getting to the point that there really wasn't much left to say.Pillars is a marvolous departure from her darker side. The plot is accurate and enthralling. There are parts that will make you want to laugh out loud, and parts that make you want to strangle someone. As with the Black Jewels Trilogy, you can almost touch the characters and see the land scape.I would recommend this book to any avid reader. (Except those who get nit-picky about historical accuracy)"
4,Pillars,"This book was great. Anne Bishop quickly became one of my favorite authors with her Black Jewels Trilogy and The Invisible Ring. I enjoyed this book very much, but I thought that the characters could have had more depth and witch power could have been explored more. I guess she's leaving that up to the next two in this series. Over all I perfered the Black Jewels story line."
5,Very good book!,This book was required my first semester of nursing school and I think it was very well thought out and written. I especially loved the tables used throughout the book to help in studying for exams. I hope my school continues to have it on their required book list.
1,How did it get this far??!!,"It's a bad show. Badly conceived, bad writing, bad acting. It never should have gotten past a full first season, much less a second, even one this short. How could Fox cancel the vastly superior Point Pleasant and replace it with this crap??!!Don't buy the first season and don't buy this second season or else you will be regretting the wasted money."
4,Excellent Show,"This is an excellent show with alot of twists and turns around every corner. Eliza Dushku pulls off her character Tru Davies with belief that she actually as the ability to rewind days because the dead can comunicate to her. Shawn Reaves, who plays the brother of Tru, I think has his breakout funny performance of his career, and made the show that much better. Criminal Minds A.J. Cook does what she does best and that is light up the screen with her looks and talent."
4,Simple yet Stylish,"It's a simple watch with a red light that looks like a bull's-eye when shone on something. The clockface doesn't match all clothes, but it's a simple and sleek carabiner roughly the same size as most."
2,Not Impressed,"I bought this for my 8 year old daughter's birthday because she saw them on TV and just had to have them. We took them out of the box and took everything apart. We played with it for about 5 minutes, put it back in the box and haven't touched it since. It's about as much fun as playing with packing peanuts (and those are cheaper!) I would not recommend this product. Maybe she is just too old for it but it's sure not much fun."
3,Halloween Fangs,"My son wanted these fangs to wear on Halloween. Once we received them he couldn't wait to mold them to his teeth. The ""glue"" leaked out of the tube and he wasn't able to mold them to his teeth. Consequently we threw them away. He was very disappointed."
3,Okay novel,"I really enjoy reading fairy tales and fantasy. However, I would only give this novel 3 stars. I checked out this book and a few others from the ""Once upon a time"" series at the library. I have not been impressed with the ""Once upon a time series."" The plots twists are interesting, but the writing is lacking and only mediocre and don't keep me engaged. Of the ones I have read so far in this series, this book by far was the best written and most engaging."
5,the storyteller's daughter,"This is one of my favorite books (written by Cameron Dokey), and I encourage anyone to read it. Cameron really has a talent for bringing each character to life, and the storyline is absolutely spellbinding! There is never a dull moment, and, as I mentioned before, this is one of my Favorites!"
5,"Best Digital Recoder for the price, the Olympus VN-180","Often I have good ideas, but my memory forgets them before i have a chance to write them down. I bought a Palm 3Xe in hopes of solving this problem. Another problem arose, I would start typing the ideas in but could only get the first one in. It took too long typing and i would forget the other ideas that i had. I was in Radio Shack and saw the perfect thing, a small digital recorder. However, i did not want there brand. The Olympus name stood out in my head and that is what i went for. I just received the VN-180 today, and i have to say this device is great. Now i can record my ideas and then type them into my Palm. It is smaller than i thought, it actually fits into the plam of my hand. It is so lite that i carry it around my neck, so i am never without. I have only had it a few hours and already it has helped me with my memory. I will also use it for school next week. Olympus, the name says it all!"
5,The other customer review IS NOT ABOUT THIS ALBUM,"I own this album and it is excellent, but the other review IS NOT ABOUT THIS ALBUM, and the track list provided in that review is not the track list for this album.The same material has been re-released as disc 3 of Ultimate Handel and is available on AmazonUltimate Handel [Box Set] or mp3 downloadUltimate Handel. See those listings for the content of this album."
1,Very Poorly Bound,"The book content is just fine. My main trouble is that the it was so poorly bound that pages are constantly falling out. I have tried even gluing pages back in but it just doesn't seen to be of much help. I would recommend that no one buy this paperback version of the book and be sure to get the Hardcover version, in hopes that it is well bound."
3,Now here's a paradox...,"...a nine hundred dollar document about free software and the open source movement.Let's be honest, if you need to read this document then what you've got to offer simply isn't relevant to a free and open movement."
5,A MUST have for any college freshman,This book is fantastic. I have given 5 copies away and will require my own children to read it when they are high school seniors. ANYBODY can benifit from this book though. I have never gone to college and it has helped me a ton!
2,OK Documentary,"This documentary was OK at best. Entire session is from a (pre 1969) notion that we were winning all battles with nearly no casualties. Was refreshing thought to hear something about the war with an antiseptic point of view (like the US Govt's back then). Also was very much like the old WWII news reels...I even think they used the same narrator:) Was not what I was expecting, If you are craving a more true to life coverage of the Vietnam war, I would recommend saving up your money and paying the extra for the ""...10 thousand day war"" series also available here."
1,this book is terrible,"We used this book for the freshmen Linear Algebra and Geometry course at my school. If it wasn't for the teacher's lectures I would not have understood any of the content in this book at all. Most of the figures are thrown in to waste ink, confuse the reader, or (in very rare occasions) represent an equation graphically. This should not under any circumstances be used as a classroom textbook (or as a reference book, etc.)."
3,Works as advertised but cheesy construction,"Works as advertised. I tried it with an old Windows 2000 laptop using the supplied driver CD and a new Windows XP machine. Both worked fine, and I was able to read a Sony Memory Stick. I was disappointed because I expected better construction for the price, which is 2-3 times the other non-docking readers. The reader protrudes a full 1"" when fully inserted into the docking station, so don't expect a flush fit. When inserting into the docking station, it mates to an awkward mini USB connector instead of something designed with more clearance appropriate for a docking station. The plastic housing is functional but a little flimsy for the price. Includes USB2 and firewire cables, but as the other viewer pointed out, the firewire cable is for external connectors and not most motherboards."
4,Claymore: Volume Four- The Rumors of War,"I enjoyed the development of the characters in this fourth volume of the set of six. The fight scenes were captivating as well. Also, the story line was continued in a functional and comprehensible manner. I was not initially sold on the series; however, as I purchased each additional volume, my attention was grabbed. It was all about the characters, battles internal and external, and the plot development of good versus evil. These formed a winning combination to draw me into Volume 4 specifically and ultimately the other five in the series."
4,after i figured it out... it worked beautifully,"the manual was a little awkward, so it took a while to figure out the intracacies of the tower. it is not completely intuitive and the manual doesn't help out that much. any real experience with towers would remedy this. not a real tower for first timers.however, it works beautifully now. it's quiet, has some nice features, and good accessability."
5,Oatmeal???,"What's easy to get,lightweight,and healthy?Oatmeal,and it's making the yeerks go crazy.Really.Well,it all begins when Rachel sees a man about to jump out of a window of a skyscraper.She naturally goes and rescues him,and after that the trouble starts mounting...First Rachel's Mom is the attorney on his case when his family wants him commited when he starts talking about aliens that live in his head,called Yeerks...When the Animorhs investigate they learn the Yeerks have found a way to go without the Kandrona,The is oatmeal,well,only the Instant Maple-Ginger kind.the yeerk gets addicted to it,goes crazy,then it no longer needs kandrona rays.The good part is the Host can comunicate and is in control most of the time,the other time the Yeerk can break through,and it will stay in the host forever.........The Animrophs see an opportunity:Where can you find a ton of yeerks without hosts?The Yeerk Pool........."
4,A very useful tool for pronunciation and use.,"I have used this book on two visits to Hong Kong and Southern China. Chinese speakers have found it useful in communicating in English as well as English speakers in Chinese. Beyond a good vocabulary of useful words, there are specialized glossaries for forms of address, medical terms, foods and cooking/eating styles. Nicely laid out and easy to use.It does use the complex character set of Hong Kong so can create some difficulty for Chinese speakers in China, but I have not found this a significant problem.It is far more a lexicon than phrase book, but I have found it handier than some of the more popular phrase books I have tried. Some of that is because it is laid out well for Chinese speakers as well as English speakers."
2,Horrible Ending,"I liked most of the episodes from this season, but I have to down rate it for the horrible ending. I wont spoil the ending for those of you that haven't seen it, but it should have been done a lot better. This would have been a great ending had there been a 3rd season, but it's like the directors just got lazy at the end and decided not to finish the season, because it just ENDS.----- SPOLIER ------Ok, I will post it here, for those that have seen the movie before. I would really love to know what happened.. Did they find the lifesource? Did they make it home? Did Elie (if that's how you spell his name) kill himself after 2 weeks so that the ship had enough power to make it all the way to where it was going? Did the crew ever wake up or did the life pods malfunction like everything else on the ship? Did the military girl (can't remember her name) ever end up getting Lou Gehrig's Disease? What happened in the next galaxy????What a horrible way to end a show."
2,Not the final season!!!,"This is not the final season! it is the last season that aired before the show was cancelled.After the last episode there was a commercial that they would be releasing the last season ""For DVD Only."" This was cancelled and the show was cancelled... without a conclusion.It is very frustrating. I have follow the Stargate shows from SG1, Atlantis, then Universe. All the others ended well...I do not believe that this show did not have the following to justify completion of the series... instead SciFi left it hanging.Oh well you win some and lose some.Just be warned that this is just the last aired season."
3,I liked it but it needs closure,I really enjoyed watching both seasons of SGU. When I got to the last episode I was looking at the clock and was wondering how they are going to end it because there was not much time left in the episode and then it was over. The ending left me(and others if you read other reviews) with a LOT of questions. If there would have been closure then I would have ranked it much higher.
4,"If you've watched season 1, you've gotta go with season 2!","Yes, I was sucked into SGU: Stargate Universe - Season 1. So, I had to watch Season 2, even though I knew in advance that the series ends abruptly at the end of Season 2. There will be no real closure, and all the character plot lines will continue to be mysteries.But it was an exciting ride!Did you like Season 1? You will enjoy Season 2."
1,Expected an unsatisfying ending,"The series has been a soap opera with occasional dollops of science, but never anything awe-inspiring. The Star Trek and other Stargate series introduced dozens of amazing inventions, temporal paradoxes, alien races--in other words, lots to remember.But what is there to remember about SGU? Endless interpersonal conflict, school dedications, cheating wives, hysterical men silenced by macho women, gardening, I'm-smarter-than-you playground talk, repetitive trips to yet another star. Most infuriating was the endless blather about Destiny's mission, whatever the hell it was supposed to be. The soap in a tin can series was mainly the fault of scripts written by people with no understanding of the core principles of sci-fi: People in unimagined situations that elicit wonder. As big a disappointment as the endings of Seinfeld and Lost. Shame on you, Sci-Fi. (I refuse to use their new spelling.)"
3,My son likes it,"My 8 month old son likes this toy, but I have to watch him while he's playing with it because it will tip over as he tries to climb it. (It's recommended for 9 mos. and up) He loves the sounds. Especially the ones with the voice overs... yes... voice overs. There are a couple of ""sound effects"" where a person is voicing the sounds, like ""chugga chugga chugga chugga...woooo hooooo"". Those seem to be his favorite ones! He grins really big after the ""woooohooo"" part. The plane should spin freely and easily, but it doesn't. It's too tightly connected. The triggers on the side are easy to pull... my son's favorite part."
4,Interesting,"I like the original (Ani Difranco) version better than Alana's but I am impressed with what Alana did with the song. Alana has a great smokey voice and I like how she made the song more upbeat. If you like Ani's version then definitely check out Alana's, if you like Alana's cover version definitely check out the original (Ani's)! The two songs are quite different but both deserve a good rating for their different reasons."
2,Adobe After Effects 4.0 Classroom in a Book,"For the information that is consistent with After Effects 4.0 the diagrams and accompanying text are clear. However, Lesson 4 (specifically p. 155, item 4) is wrought with errors and is frustrating for the learner; the directions in the fourth tutorial fail to match the capabilities the actual application. If one purchases this book, be aware of the discrepencies in Lesson 4."
2,Very light,"Just not enough ""meat"" here to make it worth recommending to others. This DVD attempts to cover far too many topics and doesn't really do any of them justice. (I just don't understand why a ""Beginning"" instructional DVD has to throw everything and the kitchen sink at you instead of focusing on a few key topics and doing them well.) Having recently converted to bass after being a long-time guitar player, I was looking for something more serious. Honestly, the only worthwhile take-away from the DVD are some of Abe Laboriel's riffs."
2,"Not what I expected, but okay for what I am doing with it.","The picture of this jukebox alarm clock is a bit misleading. It's somewhat smaller than I expected and looks like a cheap novelty toy. But since we decorated one of our guest rooms as ""The Music Room"" this fits right in. It is battery operated, which is a drawback for an alarm clock if you really depend on waking on time! It does have provision for battery backup if the main batteries die.The songs it plays are snippets of the original artists and are kinda fun."
1,Walking the Koran,"If your christian dont buy this,It has nothing to do with the 5 books of Moses,also no true idea on religion."
3,I feel the same..,"I read a very good review about this product so I bought it, but after listening to it, I felt the same. Maybe I should listen to it more times."
5,Glytone Acne Treatment,This is good stuff! I like the consistency and the fact that it covers really well. It really doesn't dry out my skin and you don't need much at all to cover zits!
3,"OK bulb, not sure they are worth the money","I purchased a set of H1's and 9006's. I've written an unfaltering review of the H1's.Unlike the H1's which I will probably return, the 9006's were installed in a car, and since it was a difficult installation they are staying. I replaced 1 bulb and compared to the remaining OEM Sylvania bulb and did notice a slight (but real!) increase in brightness with the NightHawk. The OEM bulb was fairly new, so age was not a factor in the results.Note that these are CLEAR bulbs. Don't expect a change in color compared to regular halogen bulbs. I've read that GE is going to release a Nighthawk ""Sport"" version in late 2007 that has a ""whiter"" (bluer) light for those who prefer it. Or, you can get Sylvania Silverstars, but my experience has been that they don't last very long."
4,One of Eckert's Best,"""A Sorrow In Our Heart"" is definately one of Eckert's best historical novels, right next to ""The Frontiersmen"" and ""Dark and Bloody River"". It, of course, tells the story of the Shawnee leader Tecumseh, who has been hailed by many as the greatest Indian leader of all time. Tecumseh came closer than any other before or after him to saving his people from total destruction by the whites on the eastern frontier in the early 19th century. In the end, Tecumseh's death is not just a loss in the Indians' long struggle against the Americans, it signals the death knell for their way of life, as their defeat in the War of 1812 sealed their fate on the North American continent. A great and a wonderfully entertaining book, history has never been so hard to put down."
5,The definitive Tecumseh biography,"This is an outstanding book about the greatest leader (white, black, or Native American) to ever step foot on the North American continent. The author uses an incredible amount of research to trace Tecumseh's life from birth to death. Eckert's narrative style of writing makes the book very enjoyable to read. I have read many biographies of Tecumseh and this is by far the most detailed and probably the most accurate. I highly recommend this book to anyone interested in Native Americans and their history especially if you live in the Ohio valley. The fact that I now know the history of the area makes me proud to live there. I also recommend any of Eckert's other books. He is an amazing author."
3,seroczc 7 m 7 m round clear cubic zirconia 925 sterling silver post stud earings,"they aren't purchased for myself but my sister seemed to like them okay,for the price and lazy to go to shop for these at the store they are ok,again they were for my family and as gifts they do ok."
5,The best film of all time,"I have never seen anything like it. It crackles with the most vibrant and spiritual energy. It is crude, spiritually uplfting, enlightening, goofy, slapstick, thoughtful, violent, silly, hilarious, vulgar, tragic, profound--a treat for the eyes, ears and heart. Ms Paley is a goddess."
1,Misleading - No turn by turn directions,"Without turn by turn directions, this is far from useful. Hold out for the price drops on the turn by turn gps systems such as Magellan 750."
2,Poor User Interface,"Navigation for the most part works OK, although sometimes when you cross another highway the software gets lost.The real problem is its primitive user interface. Being a software developer myself I was able to install maps but it is not an experience for the faint of heart. Worst, the entry of new address is so bad that on one occasion when we were driving to a medical appointment (15 min drive) we arrived at destination before my wife was able to finish entering the address.One advice to wizzards at Garmin: Pressing ""Find"" button when screen prompts you to select ""Find"" option should not result in loss of entire data laboriously entered, just because software expects you to press ""Enter"" button."
4,Colormap,PRO:this is a great unit. it is color. it has a powerful 12 channel reciver. CON: it takes a long time to get satilites. battey life is bad.
4,A Good Introduction to Microsoft Office 2000,"This book does a great job of explaining the basic concepts of all of the Microsoft Office programs. It also has good practice excerises. It does not, however, touch on any of the advanced or complicated features."
1,Not as expected,What I received was the piano music and not the violin part. The violin music was too small to be readable and for piano player reference only. If you are looking for the violin music this is not it unless you have a magnifyingglass. Usually you receive both parts with notes large enough to be read by each part. Very disappointing.
5,Trick's CD is da bomb and he got it goin' on!,"His cd is a ecellent cd for every1 to hear and get down to.I LOVE IT! GET IT,IT'S PHAT!"
4,Good first prayer book,"i like how this book is one of those board books. my 9 month old loves paging through this book. these are simple good prayers to start with, i just wish there was a prayer for meal time.porduct arrived on time and in great condition."
5,Very reliable and accurate,"I have used this unit for VFR navigation in my aircraft for the last 8 years. Prior to this unit, I had a Lowrance. This unit is much better than the Lowarance.You can get the location for all of the nav-aids and the airports on line, and enter them yourself. It is easy.After using VOR's, and then a King Loran for years, this unit is all you need. Though not suggested, I believe you could shoot a instrument approach (GPS or NDB). Really good CDI screen. I actually have two, and use one as a cheap DME in ORD airspace!"
5,An Original Charming Children's Classic Book,"Adelaide was a favorite of my children as were all Tomi Ungerer's books. I bought for a friend's son and he loves it. The book is charming and original and written in a way that holds a child's interest. I highly recommend it.Unfortunately, the ending has been changed (I don't know by who or why). I wish I had realized this before I bought the book new. I would have tried to find a good used copy."
