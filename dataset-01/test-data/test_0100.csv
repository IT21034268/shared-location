3,Pricing issues,"I bought this product for $30 and when it arrived it had a sticker for a chain store with the price of $19.99. Please next time at least remove the price tag. The box was a bit beat up as well. The movie itself was just fine though so, overall, I'm satisfied with my purchase."
1,So glad I didn't download this accidentally,"I was so happy to see this come up on the top list of my tivo download options, as the original hasn't been available for quite awhile. All it says is ""Aladdin"" when you look at it as a thumbnail, and the cover looks just like the original. Luckily there was a confirmation screen that showed the full title before I paid for it. I'm not interested in watching some crappy sequel.Very misleading icon."
4,Movie's great...quality of dvd??,"The movie is a great Disney classic. However, the disc skips in a few parts which makes me question whether it is an original."
4,For all ages,"Alladin is a great film for children, although a lot of adults have already seen and really enjoyed it.The soundtrack is amazing, specially a song called A WHOLE NEW WORLD, which all children seem to know by heart.I recommend it and it's ceartain that the film won't desapoint you."
4,Search Gloves,I read other reviews that stated the gloves ran big. So I stricly followed the sizing chart and ordered a large. The gloves arrived and were too small. I reordered an Extra Large. Gloves arrived the same exact size even though labeled XL. I emailed the company and I would be responsible for the cost of mailing them back. Now I'm out $44! Why should I have to pay postage for mis-labelled gloves? Good quality gloves!
2,not the best,"long fingers, short and skinny palms. i would go a differant route if i was to do this again. thanks."
2,Tips are NOT good for stained glass,"The only tips available for this iron are very blunt and not as good for stained glass work as the longer beveled ones I am used to. The chisel portion of the tip is about 1/4 inch long, they have about a 45 degree angle. I prefer the tips with 1/2 inch taper length. The barrel of the tips that go into the iron is 3/8 inch wide in diameter and over 1.5 inch long. Most tips have a smaller diameter and a shorter insertion length limiting the selection I have found to the three blunt chisel tips from Weller. They do not offer a screwdriver tip which in Weller speak appears to have the bevel length I prefer. I also like a tip that is less wide than the two they provide.Perhaps you can get used to them, but it feels very clumsy for detailed stained glass work."
2,Save your money,"Sorry, but way too much detail, and not enough perspective. Some humor would help as well, as would some advice for the groom too!"
4,Next Time Get the first book,"While I went to the bookfair in school,I found this book in a shelf in the back of the library.When I read it,it didn't make sense,but it was a good book.Next time I'll go to Borders,I'm going to get vol.1"
4,Sharpened up picture. Good quality cables.,These are very good quality cables. The picture will sharpen up quite a bit when you use these cables. They are very nice to have if your going to be surfing the net on your tv. The letters on the web sites are much easier to read.As far as the comment about looking better than the xbox 360. They don't even come close. The 360 Is 1080p with the right cables and looks much better on my tv. The wii is only 480p with these cables. Less than half the lines of resilution.Back to the subject. If you want the best cables for the wii I think thses are the right choice.
5,Incredible quality for the price,"I have purchased from Penguin United Before and thought they offered exceptional value. Their cabling is truly top notch, almost high end Monster level (I said almost not ""exactly"" the same). I will say their customer service is non existent. When I had problems with another item (non cable), they never responded to my calls or emails. If you don't care about packaging, these guys make really really good cables at reasonable prices."
3,Pretty cool,I use them as the magnets in my office. They are kind of cute. They don't look anything like the picture on the tin though. They are much simplier.
5,Watch Box Display Case,"I was hopeful when I ordered the watch box that it would be something I could be proud to display. I have a wood shop and make some furniture items but was attracted to this because it looked like something I would make, but was less than I would spend on the wood; never mind the labor and hardware involved. I was greatly surprised when I open the box and saw the chest in person for the first time! It is simply beautiful and the artisanship reflects the detail put into the case. Now I am only sorry that I did not build the case myself. I would be proud to give this as a gift to any of my friends."
5,My husband is very happy,"I ordered this off Amazon and my brother carried it back to India for us. My husband is very happy, that he finally has a box to keep his watches neatly without the danger of scratching.The finish is very neat and it can even be left out on a dressing table or side table as it looks very classy and does not need to be hidden away inside a cupboard.The lock is not v ery strong and seems to be for mostly decorative purposes. Only the top half gets locked, the bottom drawer can't be locked."
2,Just not scary at all,"This movie is obviously modeled on the blair witch approach - a bunch of folks do a documentary, they disappear, and we magically discover their tapes later. Despite blair, I enjoy that movie concept but recognize that, again given its predecessors, it must be done well. This one not so much. While its technically sound (ok acting, ok lighting, sets, etc.), it just fails to deliver a scare. As they movie progresses, paranormal things happen, but its so much more matter of fact, rather than part of a strategy to induce horror responses. Just not that engaging or interesting, but an ok watch if you had to. Highly recommend a rental before buy."
2,hard to get out of container,"The first time I used these it was for jello pudding pops and it was a huge disaster. Even after running them under hot water they would not come out. I thought this might be my wrong doing and not the fault of the product. I tried them with juice and still had difficulty getting two of them out and two others broke quickly off the stick and smashed onto the floor before melting. The stuck parts were hard to get out the way the base is shaped. The third try and I had issues with 2 out of 6 again and gave up.I had no problem with the replacements that I bought at the grocery store that were a rounder shape, so while it might be me or my freezer I must say there are better options."
3,for people with big mouths- these are large,"these work great- and unlike the silicone ones being sold- these do not smell and do not taste funny. the stand holds the pops securely until they're frozen solid- then you can take them off the stand to make more room in your freezer. the handles snap tight into the molds. you have to run these under warm water to get popsicle out of mold.i would prefer to have these half the size- they're 1 inch deep, 2 1/2 inch wide and 4 inches tall- and that's just the size of the frozen pop. it's about 7 1/2 inches long with handle. so these are for people who like a mouth full. i've been freezing soda and lemonade and crystal light in them. they were worth the $10"
5,Awesome popsicle molds,These molds are awesome. Be sure to leave space for molecule expansion (so it doesn't leak down the side). It looks and feels very sturdy.
3,"Work great, but cracked after 2nd use","I liked the product very much and worked great for making popsicles, but the molds cracked after the second time I used them."
4,Pretty good...but a little room for improvement,"My kiddos are popsicle experts. We were looking for BPA free popsicle molds and these looked great. Overall we are pleased. The molds snap into the tray and help keep them stable in the freezer. The popsicles come out easily and the molds are large enough to make quite a generous pop.But, as my son pointed out, there only three holes on the stick. This leaves a fair amount of stick without anything to hold the popsicle on the stick after it's partially eaten and semi-melted. If they had just added one more hole to the stick, they would have perfection. Our suggestion: Eat 'um quick until the manufacturer decides to add another hole."
4,excellent product for healthier snacks,I love this product.I just wish they had a better 'drip guard'.......try eating one of these without getting it all over you as it melts.This is an excellent way to have 'healthier' snacks.My first 'popsicles' were Crystal Light Fruit Punch.Great for a diabetic snack.
5,"Easy to use, great value.",Perfect for ice pops. Easy to use and easy to clean. You get a quality product for a great value.
3,Popciles are great,"I received the molds for the popcicles, but the stand was not included in my package. I understood that this would be included. Without it, I have to place the popciles carefully in the freezer so that they do not tip while freezing. If that was included this probobly would have been a five star reveiew because the popciles themselves turned out pretty good."
1,Doesn't release well,"Have to submerged under hot water to get the mold to release without the stick pulling out of the popsicle. A portion of the popsicle is left in the lower part of the handle, either get it out with a utensil or it's all over the place."
4,great little money saver,"easy to use, clean, functional and economical. A great purchase. I am considering getting another set so that I can have several flavors going at once"
4,Great Buy,"These molds are great as they basically end up wiht inbuilt drip trays for when the kiddies are eating the pops. Sturdy, easy to use. I love the fact that I can do a few different flavors in small quantities.The pops come out pretty easily with running under hot water for a short while. My only comment is that they are uite big pops for a 4 year old to finish. I love them though!"
1,Plastic cracks after just a few uses,"I purchased these to replace an older Popsicle maker. The reviews sounded encouraging. However, after just a few uses, the plastic molds are starting to crack. Not what I'd expect."
1,Plastic brittle when cold making it DANGEROUS for children,We really liked these molds when we first got them but they break when they are dropped...which is all the time if you have kids or a full freezer.I've had both the clear and green sections break.What was most frightening is that when the green part broke I hadn't noticed it was cracked and gave it to my child. It broke off in her lips and she handed it to me...***OMG IT WAS RAZOR SHARP AND JAGGED*** had she been a younger child and more apt to 'explore' she could have been seriously harmed if not killed.These are either going to be returned or put in the garbage... I'm waiting to hear back from the manufacturer.
1,ice pop mold not so hot,"I would not recommend these ice pop molds. They are rather large, take up a lot of space in your freezer and the base on the stick does not catch drippings so they are very messy."
5,what a great idea,Each popsicle can be individually removed and refilled meaning that you will never have to be without your homemade pop's
3,Heavy duty but almost too tough,"These molds are very sturdy and well made, but I found that once you get the pieces snapped together, they are hard to get apart. I was making fudgesicles, and not ""ice pops"", but I don't think it would be any easier to get apart no matter what the contents are. Even after running hot water over the pop for several seconds, I had to use a dish towel to hold onto it to snap the body from the handle."
4,Great series. Lousy packaging for Season 3,"I love this series, but Sony failed customers with the Season 3 packaging. Great cover but the set is in a poorly designed DVD case with all three discs on a single center hub. I found it hard to remove them and was concerned I would break the center of the discs trying to get them out of the case. I'll be looking for an alternate case to put them into. Otherwise I am thrilled to have The Nanny Season 3 on DVD FINALLY !! Hope Sony releases all six seasons eventually but in better packaging for the rest of the series."
5,Fran is the best!,I am so happy that sony released season three of the nanny. I am a little bummed that they have not released the rest of the season =/
5,when?,"So when will season 3, 4, 5, and 6 be released?? We have been waiting for too long!! Anywhere we can write to besides here?"
5,Almost given up hope!,Thank you Thank you Thank you.What a great season this is.Please don't make us wait so long for season 4.And thank you Amazon for automatic e-mail alerts!
4,It's a Hit!,"I love the content of the Third Season. I can't wait for the next season. The only problem that I had was that it comes on 3 dvd's and they stack them on top of each other. They really should have given each dvd it's own spool, like the other two seasons."
3,broke in 2 weeks,The kids had a blast with this toy. I had a lot of kids over at Thanksgiving and it broke! We had only been using it for 2 weeks?!?!!?
4,"Good, but volume II is fabulous","This is a really nice CD. The songs all cover simple ideas, great for toddlers. The music is nice and the kids voices are cute (not annoying). But while I give this one an A-, volume II is definitely an A++. It is incredible!!"
3,How girls were brainwashed in the 50's and 60's,"This actual school textbook is all about the propriety and importance of the way teenage girls shoudl dress. Instead of letting girls experiment, this book comes right out and tells it's readers that they must wear makeup, have perfect poise, and know the proper ways to apply nail polish and sit in a chair. This is a femenists worst nighmare. The section of clothing choices is rather amusing from the modern standpoint, in the way it teaches how to repair and mend clothing and how to sew.Things that really disturb me in this book include the step-by-step instructions of brushng teeth as well as the entire section on 'healthy' diaets and eating habits.However, this book may be a nice trip down memory lane for people who may have been subjected to this type of brinwashing during their Home Ec days. :-)"
5,Great Album Overall,"I was kinda leaning not to buy this album but I am glad I did nice album all the tracks are good I listened to track 1 to 17 non stop Master P reminds me of the ghetto d days and the new people on no limit delivered some nice tracks also there's a solo track from C-Murder the song is crunk also C-Murder and Silkk shoulda been on the album more since TRU is Master P, C-Murder, and Silkk as I recalled but I recommend this cd one of the hottest albums to hit the streets in a long time I give it 5 out of 5. Dennis Detroit,MI"
2,Led Zeppelin's III'rd,"Songs Worth the Listen:""Immigrant Song""- It's Historic.""Friends""- It brings light to a necessary subject. Determined and moved feeling is what you get from this.""Out On The Tiles""- Modest song about expressing love of music.""Hats Off To Roy Harper""- Partly vengeance song.Songs not Worth Downloading:""Celebration Day""- A story about a lady who's battered and in trouble.""Since I've Been Loving You""- A nagging song about dealing with an unsuccessful relationship.""Gallow's Pole""- Deadly song (poison sign)""Tangerine""- An unsure complaining song about heat and a fallen relationship.""That's The Way""- Part of the song is about not being noticed.""Bron-Y-Aur Stomp""- Complex song about a broken relationship."
5,A response to the rhythm section critic,"It boggled my musician-mind to read the clued out distaste expressed by another reviewer for Zep's r. section. As a bassist of both the upright and electric persuasions, I must take issue with this: John Paul Jones was one of the most talented bassists rock has ever been graced with. His imaginative, melodic and ""in the pocket"" riffing was what got me inspired to pick up the instrument in the first place.Let's hear it from other musicians: Did Zep have rhythm or not? You bet your guitar/bass/drums they did. Case Closed."
3,Mediocre.,"If these guys had decided to release an album under the name ""Joe and the Dudes"" just to see how they'd do without their already famous name, this album would be long forgotten. In fact, in this day of wonderful recording quality and post-primitive guitar technology, I cannot understand why anybody listens to 80% of Led Zeppelin's _oeuvre_. Page's guitar always sounds twangy, Plant's falsetto is only slightly pre-Bee Gees falsetto, and the rhythm section ... well, let's put it this way, I'll take Mike and Alex. What do these guys have that 10 bands since haven't had? Only fame. Yuck. I give it three stars to denote mediocrity."
5,Zeppelin's best acoustic work.,"You know acoustic guitars? No pickups, no distortion, no effects?This is one of the best acoustic rock guitar albums ever made. Zeppelin draws heavily from folk and the blues to create a terrific listening experience. The album starts with an infamous vocal line from Robert Plant; it's followed with some of Zeppelin's strongest tracks, notably Gallows Pole and Tangerine. This isn't the best introduction to Led Zep, but would make a great second or third album to own."
3,The Big Change-Up,"Led Zep's third record is where they decided to throw all thier new fans a huge curveball:in place of thier famous gut-bucket blues,they here present virtually an entire album of gently strummed folk laments.For a band who made it's name with a heavy blues sound it's not bad,but any random Crosby Stills and Nash album does this a whole lot better.It's probably better to see this album as a necessary step in reinventing thier sound and attitude,as Led Zep were never a band to rest on it's laurals;in leaving thier initial fan base behind,they opened up fertile vistas to explore.In doing so,they ushered in thier golden age."
4,"Good Album, but not perfect","""The Imagrant Song"" is one of my favorite Leppelin songs, it is a classic. Since I've been loving you is also one of my favorites. I think the music is great and the lyrics are great too, But I think it just came out at the wrong time, between two and four. It also showed the softer side of Zeppelin. The more acoustic side. Some people respect bands when they try new things and others don't."
5,A great Zeppelin album!!!,This 3rd album from Zep is a great album!!! Great songs!!! Great remastered sound!!! Five Stars!!! A+
1,NO PACKAGING,"I am sure this product is fine, but it is for a gift and it comes in plastic shipping bags...no container, tin, or box...that should be clearly stated in the ad...I can't give this as a gift...it would be fine if it was for my own children, but not as a gift! Unfortunately I will be returning this item."
3,McPhee tells stories you can use in your life,"What a story teller! Delightful, descriptive and, I've found, applicable as a way to think through situations. I wasn't a McPhee fan until I read this collection of stories. Now I'm an advocate."
4,THE FLYING GULLOTINE,"THIS MOVIE THE FLYING GULLOTINE WAS INTERESTING AS WELL AS EXCITING, FROM THE BEGINNING TO THE END I FOLLOWED IT TO THE TEA AND WAS GLAD TO SEE FINALLY SOMEKIND OF HAPPY ENDING WHERE THE ONE FIGHTER WHO EXCELLED IN HIS FIGHTING ART MADE IT TO THE END TO BE WITH HIS WIFE AND CHILD."
3,kung fu,This is an old school martial art style movie .The special effect is not as great as they are for the newer update movies.I have seen all version of the flying guillotine. It is a good movie for when it was originally made.
2,Outdated,"This guide needs to be updated. Don't buy this book, it's less than helpful. I bought it hoping to get a heads-up when going to Germany but I found it not to be very helpful."
1,very annoying writing,"Mr. Turtledove writes as though he is paid by the word, shoveling out boring dialogue and worse prose. This is the third book in this series I have read; if it weren't for the fascinating idea of the alternate American history, I couldn't have done it. James Whitmore quoted Harry Truman telling a story about a black man in 1920's Missouri. The man told Harry his boss gave him a bottle of whiskey as a gift. Harry asked him, ""Well, how was it""? The man replied, ""It was just about right. If it was any better he wouldn't have given it to me and if it was any worse, I wouldn't have drunk it"". If this book were written any more poorly, I wouldn't have read it.Turtledove's writing is putrid. He would do better by teaming up with a competent writer; he has interesting ideas and plots.It is like a typical Star Trek movie. Take a great idea and ruin it by letting William Shatner or Jonathan Frakes direct it."
2,Not Recommended,"I couldn't make it past the first 100 pages or so. Turtledove's writing is flat and simplistic. His characters are unengaging and his jokes are not funny. Dialog between political, military, and social leaders is on the adolescent level (and not even in the Clintonesque sense)."
3,First time reading one of his books...,"I've always been interested in alternate history and what-if type stories, so I thought I'd give this book a read. I really wanted to love it, but couldn't. It's not that it's a bad book, it's just ponderous and slow. And like others before me have said, the author tends to rehash some of the stuff he already said. There was even one paragraph about the Canadian postmaster that was practically a cut and paste job, and they were chapters apart! But I've heard his other books are really good, so I'll probably give him another chance."
1,Worst book on gay rights ever,"I'm surprised that Cambridge University Press would have published this very weak study of lesbian and gay organizing in Britian and the US. It reads like senior thesis. Instead of this book, I would recommend the serious scholarship of people like Craig Rimmerman, Steven Seidman or Mark Blasius."
5,Great Reality Soap!,"This is really cool! Great package, great show, great family! Really, this is fun to watch and to see, that the god of thunder is a ""normal"" family man with the normal troubles as a father... you got to have it!"
2,Are You A Beginning Fisherman (fisherperson)?,"I have been fishing since I was a young'un but never for trout. Since I recently moved to the mountains, I bought this book along with a fly fishing book to get some insight on trout fishing. For my purposes, I was disappointed in ""Spin Fishing for Trout"". I think this would be a good book for someone just starting out fishing but if you have been fishing for any time at all, I would use the money to buy a few spinners instead."
3,Key documentation of caving history,"This is a good book for the events it documents. However, it tends to drag on at times, just like the exploration did, and can be hard to follow if you're not familiar with the area. Of course the big connection moment is incredible and you won't be able to put it down. ""Beyond Mammoth Cave"" is much more fast paced and entertaining overall. A must read for cavers either way."
4,Like this tea!,I get so tired of trying to accommodate the whims of the local retailers that I now purchase what I want online! Let the local stores play games; I don't have to shop there! love this tea.
4,Great Irish Taste,"I love the great, rich, Irish flavor of this tea. I buy it whenever I am running low. The price is a bit high, but overall, I am very satisfied with the quality of this product. The packaging could be more condensed, allowing for delivery to a mailbox."
4,A happy tea convert,"I've always been a coffee drinker until a friend introduced me to Twinings Irish breakfast decaffeinated tea, now I occasionally have a cup of coffee but always look forward to my morning cup of tea."
1,"Works occasionally, not often enough","I bought this to enable DirecTV On Demand. Set it up as instructed. I have my TV mounted on a swivel, and the router is behind the TV. When I swivel the TV and the router moves, I lose the connection, and the Belkin unit is unable to regain the connection unless I reset it. A big pain in the butt. Right now it hasn't worked in days. I'm very disappointed in the unit, but I didn't pay anywhere near the [...] it's currently listed for. [...]"
1,Routinely loses connection to wireless network,"I'm using this with a Mediagate. It seems that there is some kind of timeout that causes this thing to disconnect from the wireless network if the Mediagate is turned off for an extended period of time. Unfortunately it doesn't reconnect when the Mediagate comes back on. I have to plug the ethernet cable into my laptop to get it to reconnect. Very irritating. I know that the Mediagate is probably part of the problem, but I don't really understand why the device would *ever* disconnect from the wireless network since the device is always on."
5,"Worked fine , no more cables across the floor!","This product works fine!!! The instruction manual told me how to access the system directly, and set-up was simple. I can PING the device, or PING ""through"" it. I does what I need in that it allows me to keep my loud or hot servers in the garage, while I work from my home office. SweetIt came with a setup CD, but when I used that, the instructions were lacking, and it did not have all choices, etc. So try it first, but if it doesnt work, just read the manual about how to access the system, and it is easy from there on."
5,Works Excellently with My Macs,"Just bought this thing hoping to gain wireless access to my Apple WiFi Extreme Router.Im using this on an older G3 iMac in my basement.The WiFi Extreme is on the first floor.So I plugged this ethernet adapter in and boom, instant fast access!Didnt required any configuring. It just works.Way to go Belkin!"
2,what,"Ok i think to stop at number 4 but hey i cant say to the people who make the movies to stop, to me just not feel the same at the first 4 does, but if you like police academy movies them get them all rock on"
1,UOPHX NEEDS NEW TEXT FOR THIS CLASS,This is the worst text book I have ever had to use. Nary a single useful practical exercise in this book. Just a compilation of the author's professional exploits. This is not crying over spilt milk. I earned an A in the class in spite of the text.
2,LACK OF INFORMATION,"I""m looking for a book to find out how do I do to prevent/control mold.I'm already aware of the risks mold brings to my family and would like to know how to deal whith it in every days bases. Instead, the autor recomends me to contract especialists and be careful whith several aspects of my insurence apollicies.I want to prevente the need of specialists and I'm am hoping not to have to use my insurance!"
3,1857 Version,"This BBC concert of the 1857 Version of ""Simon Boccanegra"" is on a much lower level of achievement than the magnificent concert performance of the orginal version of ""Don Carlos"". Still, the original ""Boccanegra"" is a must-hear for any lover of that opera. It demonstrates just how brilliant Verdi was at revising and editing his own earlier work. Alas, this recording is handicapped with dim dry accoustic and the absence of libretto. Even the synopsis provided is of the 1881 version instead of the performance you are hearing. Still, bonus tracks of Abbado's 1976 La Scala performance add to plus side of this equation. I would however recommend getting the Dynamic recording of ""Simon"" in the 1857 version conducted by Renato Palumbo. It has better sound AND a libretto."
2,"Worthy goal, but hindered by weak writing.","""Between Two Fires"" reveals little new and signficant material on the Native American's role in the Civil War, but it does attempt to cover both sides of the War. Hauptman should be commended on making Indian involvment on both the sides the focus of his book, but his clumsy narrative dilutes the subject's impact."
5,hot hot hot,"The album is HOT y'all ! Buy it, it's better than her first one. The beats are tight. This is the album of the year. Biggups to MISSY and ""THE MAN"" ...called TIMBALAND"
5,This CD is great. If you don't have it your crazy.,Missy Elliots the real world has everything you want to here. Slow beats and fast beats. Something for the fellas and something for the ladies. Missy has the right combination that makes a CD great.
4,Missy takes hip-hop to another planet................,"The best thing that can be said about ""Da Real World"" is that Missy Elliott did it the way she wanted to do it. How many artists can truly say they have complete control over their projects. There is very few artist that can do so many different things and do them well. Missy Elliott is one of the few. I am most impressed with her songwriting abilities. I am hoping everyone realizes how important Missy is to not only rap music but also R&B as well.(you go girl, and you keep going)."
2,Missy Elliot -Did you like it?,I listened to the album after hearing the single All up in my grill I thought that song was really good but the rest of the album was kinda so-so.
1,Sadly this is not the horrifically wonderful Musical version,"The obviously over-dubbed musical numbers which elevate this film into a comedy classic are sadly missing from this DVD version. The insipid acting, asinine dialogue, goofy clay monsters, even the appearence of a chipanzee. All this hilarious comic potential seems wasted without the ""positive"" and ""inspirational"" musical numbers. I mean come on people, ""We have failed master, we have failed"" it's a freaking classic! Wake up!Looks like it's back to that worn VHS copy of the musical version I taped off T.V. (musical version = five stars)"
2,"Same Personnel, Different Results","Although the film stars Kerwin Mathews and Torin Thatcher, both from ""The 7th Voyage of Sinbad"" and is directed by the same director of that film, Nathan Duran, this is a much weaker film. The stop-motion work is nowhere near as polished as Harryhausen's and the score by Paul Sawtell pales in comparison to the brilliant Herrmann one for the earlier flick."
4,"Love the reviews about the movie, book was good too...","I read ""Jack of Kinrowan"" - which is both ""Jack the Giant Killer"" and ""Drink Down the Moon"" - a few years back and enjoyed it quite a bit. A good retelling of the classic tale.I think it's funny that most of the reviews on this page are for the movie, which has absolutely nothing to do with the book."
3,Giant Killer,"Even if this is not as good as Ray Harryhausen at his best in ""Jason and the Argonauts"" and ""The 7th Voyage of Sinbad"", it is certainly as good a quality as the later Sinbad's he did. Anderson's creatures may be a little rough around the edges by todays special effects standards but it is still quite entertaining for the whole family. Most children will find it great fun. There are numerous monster creatures and several interesting good characters. Kerwin Mathews and the rest the cast do above average performances. The sets and music help draw us into this wonderful adventure fantasy story. If you like Fantasy movies you will probably enjoy this one. Did you miss the price on this DVD? Talk about a bargain! Even if you for some odd reason you didn't love it you could donate it to a good cause. I got the DVD and even though released by Good Times it is an excellent transfer. The picture and sound are great. Good quality DVD and replayability. Most kids will love this."
1,THE MOST OVERRATED ALBUM OF ALL TIME!,Rock And Roll is listenable. But Stairway To Heaven is really disgusting! It is one of the worst songs ever. Everybody I know got tired of the song. The rest tracks are neither great nor bad. They are just forgettable pretentious songs.
5,An Absolute Must Have!,"Led Zeppelin is my all-time favorite band and this is without a doubt their best album even though I like Houses of the Holy a little better. Every song on this album is FANTASTIC and stands on its own. I actually enjoy Four Sticks even though its not as well known as the rest of the songs on this album. It has an eastern flavor to it and was a logical choice when Page/Plant used this track as part of their EXCELLENT No Quarter CD! The Drum sound on When the Levee Breaks is a testament to the timeless drum sound of John Bonham. And as far as Stairway to Heaven is concerned, it is one of, if not THE most popular song in the history of recorded music!"
5,30 Years of the Hammer of the Gods,"Its been 30 years since the release of one of the most important documents in hard rock history. Led Zeppelin iV represented a turning point in Led Zeppelin career as a rock band. After three succesful albums the band decided let the music do all the talking to the point of releasing the album without any obvious indication on the cover art about the band or the album title. This recording cover al bases of the Led Zeppeling ground: The hard rock of Black Dog & Rock & Roll, The folk sounds of the Battle of Evermore and Going to Cailfornia and the Epci sound of Stairway to Heaven. Every Led Zeppelin record is essential to the complete understanding of hard rock but this would be the the one that made them legends."
2,the gospel according to.,"Was a cheap photocopied cover (including a photocopy of a sticker saying ""features stairway to heaven"") not even close to original packaging, the photo of the product was misleading. vinyl was warped but plays okay."
2,"Yeah, give me those ""non-helpful"" votes!","I do indeed happen to think that Led Zeppelin IV is way overrated. True, ""Stairway to Heaven"" is an alright tune but hey, it doesn't come near to the great tunes (and rythms!) of say Moody Blues ""Every good boy deserves favour"". What about the rocking side? Well, Led Zeppelin is competent in that area but you have to turn to LZ II which easily gets 5 stars. Every track on LZ II (except Moby Dick) is way above anything on LZ IV.They never delivered another album like LZ II again (but possibly there are some great live recordings out there which I don't know)."
2,A BIT overrated,"Sorry to knock out a line of five star reviews, but along with another fellow who gave this album two stars, i must agree that save for a couple of gems such as Stairway and Black Dog, the album wasnt particularly great."
5,MASTERPIECE!!!,"All I can say is buy this album now, I have never heard anything like it. PURE GENIUS!!!"
5,Best of them all!,"This is by far Led Zeppelin's best album ever. It has classic songs like Black Dog, Rock n' roll. and most importantly, STAIRWAY TO HEAVEN! if you don't have this album, well you must not like classic rock. This is the Bomb!"
5,Led Zeppelin's greatest record,This cd has many of zeppelin's greatests hit like going to califoria; black dog; and a personal favorite of mine; stairway to heaven. This cd is well worth the money
5,An indisputable classic,"First of all, as a huge fan of Zeppelin, I may have some biases as to this album's greatness and legacy. Some people recognize this as repetitive and ponderous, others look at it as one of the greatest albums ever. I happen to go with the latter. This album has all the musical diversity Zeppelin fans have come to expect from them, and it set a standard for hard rock that has influenced basically every band since it's release. Every song on the list is listenable, and most of them are still played frequently on FM radio. Black Dog, Rock and Roll, Going to California, and When the Levee Breaks are highlights. Of course, no review of Led Zeppelin IV would be complete without a few words about their magum opus, not to mention the most requested rock song of all time, Stairway to Heaven. It's simply put an experience in itself. I can't really say that I have a favorite album by Zeppelin, but if I had to pick one, this would probably be it."
1,Overplayed Garbage,"What truly amazes me is that you pot smokin' gearheads actually have the money to buy cd's not to mention computers. Food stamps can pay for the vittles, that I understand, but buying computers? Maybe our economy is doing a little too well when we've got high school dropouts surfing on the time off from the local Mickey D's."
1,Whats The Bigg Deal??,"Hey hey all, what is down?? Wow, every time I turn on the radio, all I hear is songs from this lame, dated album!! The singer is like a dying whiney girl, the guitar playa only plays like 4 cords, the bassist isn't even plugged in, and the drummer is just a lazy oaf hitting stale bread!! For better musik, I would recommend you play Korn, Linkin Park, Fall Out Boy, Atreyu, Taking Back Sunday, Limp Bizkit, Staind, My Chemical Romance, Kidd Rock and the legendary Michael Jackson!! Go Bengals!! The bengals will be football's 2007 champs!!"
1,Debate time!,"Led Zeppelin and the Beatles are considered great bands(The Beatles are better though) and Zeppelin's masterpiece has 8 songs on it? The Beatles' White Album has 30 songs on it! I'm sorry but the Skelter Boys were a little bit more musical, wouldn't you think. After all, the lyrics talked to Charles Manson! Zeppelin is junk compared to whom everyone wants to be bigger than!!!!!!!!!!!The Beatles"
2,Only 2 good songs,"I'll give this CD 2 stars because I like 2 songs on this LedZeppelin IV. The songs are Rock and Roll, and Stairway to Heaven.I bought this CD because Stairway to Heaven was one of the greatest rock and roll songs of all time. The rest of thisalbum is just noise. Green Day's new album is better.Blah!!!! See ya later rock fans.Love Waiting for a Girl Like You,Sincerely, The Heavy Rocking Guitar Solo Kid."
3,???????????????????????,"""If you don't like Led Zeppelin's music, you have to respect them as musicians. It's the law. And if you don't, in all sincerity, the world would be a better place if you killed yourself"".Speechless. That review stunned me. ""the world would be a better place if you killed yourself"" just because you don't like Led Zeppelin?????? By all means click on the ""no"" button below, but ask yourself if the reviewer who wrote that is taking the right attitude."
4,Timeless classic rock,"Everyone I knew had this album when I was a teenage stoner and it's not only because it's what all the other stoners expected you to have - it's just a damn good album and thanks to all those Zep heads out there, it's now been remastered with a little help by some of the members. So I get ""Rock & Roll"", ""Stairway To Heaven"" and all the others in full glory. Makes me wanna smoke up, but maybe I'll just pour myself some wine and go back to the Carly Simon albums - age sucks."
1,Enough already,"The only remotely redeeming feature of this album is the presence of the great Sandy Denny on backing vocals on ""The Battle For Evermore."" But why blow your money on this, when there are many albums where you can hear her without all of Robert Plant's ear shattering screeches?Besides, do you really need to hear the world's most over played song ""Stairway to Heaven"" yet again?"
5,"Led Zeppelin-great,superb,brilliant and terrific","Led Zeppelin are the greatest rock band ever and this is their best and highest selling album all over the world and is a landmark heavy rock album which has sold in excess of 23 million copies worldwide.this great album features anthems like BLACK DOG,STAIRWAY TO HEAVEN,WHEN THE LEEVEE BREAKS and my best song ROCK AND ROLL.Very highly recommended.Ignore the ONE star reviews for this great album and avoid albums from highly overrated bands like Nirvana,Green Day and Guns n roses who suck."
5,The greatest album from the greatest band,"Led zeppelin's Zoso or fourth album is the greatest heavy metal album ever along with Machinehead from Deep purple.this classic album contains masterpieces like Black dog,Rock and roll and When the leevee breaks.Highly recommended.Ignore the haters and the naysayers.Buy this.Led zep rock!!!!!!!."
2,I'm just not sure what the hype's about!!,"...Besides the fairly pleasant sounds of ""Stairway to Heaven,"" I really don't get the hype lavished on this strange band. I don't think Led Zeppelin has a troo future making music. They come nowhere close to the unbelievably fresh sounds of Nickelback, Limp Bizkit (step off Fred Durst), Staind, Puddle of Mudd, and the awesome Default. To me, Led Zeppelin is boring brand rock, corporate and too drawn out. The guitar player stretches out his over-the-top solos way too long, the singer sounds like he has pliers clenching his English gonads, and the drummer is way off time.In short, avoid this band like the plague, and stick with troo metal muscle like Bizkit and Staind. Like I said, ""Stairway"" is a truly good song..."
3,Stairway to Heaven is NOT the greatest song of all time.......,What do you think all you people? Stairway to Heaven is a good song....I mean I like it better than FREEBIRD period. But I think probably the greatest song ever written and recorded wasprobably DIRE STRAITS HEAVY FUEL........and not Stairway to Heaven. You got the idea right?.....That Heavy Fuel is probablythe greatest song in HISTORY. Anyway I've always loved this CDfor that 1 or 2 good song.
4,The album is the best in it's class,"It's a Zepplin fans most treasured album. This album may simply be Zeppelin's greatest album. It goes from slow ""Stairway to Heaven"" to the explosive ""When the Levee Breaks."" Other hits on this album include ""Misty Mountain Hop"" and ""Going to California."" This is a must hear/must have in your CD collection. GET IT TODAY"
4,"Music Fan (Indianapolis,IN)","This album is definitely a must for Zepplin fans. Songs such as BLACK DOG and the unforgettable STAIRWAY TO HEAVEN are just a few of what makes the album so great. Led Zepplin is a timeless band that appeals to all. I know, becuase I'm only 16 but I love Led Zepplin and can't get enough. If your a Zepplin fan, or even if your not, and you don't own this album, I suggest you get it. It's one of the best!"
5,A classic worth owning,"This was one of my favorite albums in the 70s. My LP gradually got worn and scratched. This CD is beautifully remastered and sounds better than my old LP, even when it was new off the shelf. Great album by a great group. This is truly a classic."
2,Wrong battery for the Lumix DMC-FZ40!! Amazon recommends it incorrectly!!!,"I ordered this along with a Panasonic Lumix DMC-FZ40 and realized that it is not the correct battery for it. In fact there are no spare batteries available for the Panasonic Lumix DMC-FZ40. Amazon, please change your recommendations and bundling offers which incorrectly recommend this battery for the Lumix DMC-FZ40!"
4,No nonsense spare battery for DMC-FZ7,Works well with Panasonic DMC-FZ7. Did not notice any difference in battery life compared to shipped mfg battery.
3,You get what you pay for,"The battery is disappointing; it does not measure up to the original battery that comes with the Lumix camera as it has only half the battery life/photo support capacity. This is potentially problematic if you are in the field doing extensive photo shoots. At best, this battery is no more than a back-up. In retrospect I would have been better off paying the difference in price and purchasing the Lumix replacement battery instead."
1,It would not stay charged...,"Ok, well, you get what you pay for.I should have known when the green light of my charger would not light up...that this battery was not charging.A complete dud. I need to return it but is it worth the blankety-blank postage?Next time I will get a Panasonic."
4,Lenmar DLP006 Battery,I bought this as a spare battery for my Panasonic Lumix DMC-FZ35 based on other recommendations. Seems to be doing the job just fine. Good battery life and nicely priced.
1,"Intellectually dishonest, jaded by modernism","DeRosa's little tirade against the Church isn't what you'd call balanced. Its heavy handed, uncharitable, and in many places simply wrong.Perhaps DeRosa thought that after the second Vatican Council, the Catholic Church was going to embrace Modernism. How naieve. But his agenda is clear from other sources. He is (or at least was according to sources I read) pro abortion, pro contraception, enamored of the female priesthood movement, ad nauseum. Your typical liberal schmoozer.If you want the facts about the Catholic Church, go to the source. Seek out an RCIA program at a parish close to you and let the Church do its job. They will be more than happy to give you honest answers to honest questions. But Peter DeRosa doesn't work there anymore."
2,A bit irrelevant to the ailment,"Sufferers of Tinnitus be alarmed.This book will not add anything to your knowledge about tinnitus.Just like the title says, it is a self-management guide to help you cope with anything that might be bothering you. It could very well have been (and this book would apply to) any other situation affecting your lives and not necessarily tinnitus."
1,perfection - NOT!,"I was so excited to give this to my son as I enjoyed it as a child. I bought one, which did not work right out of the box. The timer didn't run. I exchanged it for a new one. Same thing. It seems to work after spending hours on top of a warm radiator.Bummed."
5,We love Perfection !!,"My girls can't get enough of this game. It's not one that they play every day but it is definitely one that when they play they play for a long time. The object is to put all the shapes into their place before the buzzard goes off, If you don't get all the pieces in on time then all the pieces pop out. It is a really cute game that your kids will enjoy, get ready for some fun and lots of laughs."
5,Unique Mindsoothing Music,John Stanford's Deep Space is by far one of the best music albums I have listened to. It is unique with its sound by relaxing you but keeping an upbeat tempo that does not make you tired. You can set it on repeat and listen to it over and over for hours and give your home or office a nice relaxing atmoshpere.
2,Solid Work,"Not the best text book I've used.DVD does not appear to work, having tried three different working DVD drives and players. Package seal (probably illegally) says once broken that you foreit all return rights.The book is based around tutorials, a lot of space is devoted to listing what you will be doing and the ""course"" structure. Once past the initial, and confusing parts, the rather basic illustrations do give you a reasonably structured introduction to using the application, and solid modelling.Perhaps OK for students, but does seem rather expensive, considering the DVD apparently does not work in the UK."
5,"Still the best, easiest guide to cactus","This book was published decades ago yet is still a great reference for visitors to the southwest who want to learn about cactus, but don't want to strain their brains. Reg Manning was a popular cartoonist and long-time desert dweller. He distills a lot of information about the desert and its unique flora into a small book. The use of whimsical cartoons entertains and instructs. I first read this book as a child and still remember names of cactus based on Manning's light hearted approach. I keep a copy on hand for my Tucson visitors. This book is particularily popular with Germans! If you live in Arizona, or vacation in the Southwest desert, this book belongs in your library."
4,Wonderful cinematography!,"This is a fantastic exercise in film artistry, not to mention an interesting look into African Culture. I hope you all enjoy this film."
1,The Emperor is Buck Naked,"I was eagerly anticipating seeing this film, since it received so much praise. To say that I was bitterly disappointed is a sad understatement. Despite the fact that I'm interested in Gullah culture and African-American history in general, this film managed to put me to sleep after the first 15 minutes. No character development, no plot, no coherence (being a Jim Jarmusch fan, I can't even believe I'm writing this). I couldn't figure out the relation of half the characters to each other, or in some cases, even their names, because the dialect is almost unintelligible and there are no subtitles. It's as if you're dropped off in the middle of a strange family on an island, and during the time you stay there, they reveal nothing about themselves. Most student filmmakers could do better. I agree with the other review writer who stated this was one of the worst films they'd ever seen. Rent a Spike Lee film instead, or a PBS show about Gullahs."
1,Sadly disappointing,"Alright, the premise of the first movie was far-fetched. But the fun of it made it worthwhile. This is just as sorry as any of Hollywood's worst make-a-buck sequels ... more inane, just about as much gore. But not gory enough to top the horror masters (so, again, nothing new). All in all, nothing for anyone (except the lead actor and actress's families, I guess)."
3,Not as advertised,"We got this CD to help our daughter to relax while she is falling asleep. Unfortunately not all of the songs are relaxing enough for this to work. This CD, although it has good music, isn't quite what it is advertised to be."
5,Such a fun read :),"What can I say, I'd recommend this book to anyone who's interested! Very well written, funny as heck, and relatable (the main purchase for the book, right?)."
5,I laughed aloud -- except when I read about my sign,"Everyone who's read Born on a Rotten Day says the same thing. ""It's brilliant, except for the part about my sign.""True, this is a scarily right-on book. More than that, it's some of the best writing I've read in a long, long time.If you want to laugh, to learn what the stars say about you or your significant, or if you'd just like to admire the craft of a talented, over-the-top writer, you can't do better than Hazel Dixon-Cooper.Laugh your way through this, her first book, and you'll understand why Dixon-Cooper was selected as Cosmo's new Bedside Astrologer--and why her many fans are waiting for the next Rotten Day book -- and the next.I'm recommending Born On A Rotten Day to all of my friends -- whatever their signs -- and to every writer who wants to learn more about the craft and skill of crafting humorous nonfiction.--Bonnie Hearn Hillhttp//:www.bonniehearn.com"
4,Scrabble for Dummies,"This game ads a fun new twist to the familiar favorite Scrabble. The scoring is simpler, which makes it a little easier for younger kids to get."
5,a great 'pilot',"as i always knew, what a GREAT writer, a MUST collection for kindle!! easy to navigate, e.t.c. too bad the illustrations are so small! i have the cheap kindle, not the 50"" screen model!!"
5,exactly what i wanted,"just as entertaining today as ever. some translation is required(old language), i am able to realize an ambition that is 60 years old."
1,The Works of Mark Twain and what was missing,"I bought this book for one reason only. To read: The Celebrated Jumping Frog of Calaveras Country"" guess which is the only book short story which in not in this collection. The very one I bought the book for in the first place. I am furious.I bought the kindle version. I will not ever trust the person who is selling this book on Amazon. He should have checked first to make sure each book/short story was in fact included before he listed what the table of contents is.gailann"
3,Is this some sort of a joke?,"First off, yes the product cleans very well. I'm a fan of Dyson products. But here's the downside.Why do the spray mechanisms always break??? I mean ALWAYS! Our family must have bought over a dozen of these cans, over a span of a few years (not all at one time). And opening up the purple top of a new one, the sprayer is either already broken or breaks within a couple of uses. I'm assuming the people at Dyson use their own products. I find it absurd that they've let this go on for years now.One solution is to dump all the stuff into a generic spray bottle. But I can't be sure if the chemicals do something to other types of bottles or gets screwed up when you transfer it. At this price, I expect more. Especially when there are other products out there that do the job too."
4,Yay! No more stain!,"Definitely not the cheapest carpet cleaning product, but hey it got out a stain that some of the generic brands just couldn't handle. works really well on dirt, juice, soda, and oils. But... not so good for chocolate. So if you have a chocolate stain, this isn't for you... sorry."
1,wat a waste,"this movie STINKS! the actors playing the well loved cast dont have a clue as to how to be bo, luke, rosko, or boss. they needed to watch the real show to know how to play them. willie nelson was the only one that did a good job. he played jesse well. the actor playing daisy did alright too. she doesnt have catherine bachs legs though. ;)i cant believe this was bothered to be put out on dvd. GARBAGE LIKE THIS is put out, but great shows like clint eastwoods RAWHIDE is stopped right after putting out season3!"
2,If you thought the first movie was bad...,"Ugh. The 2005 movie wasn't great and this prequel is far weaker than that movie in every way possible. Most of the characterization is unbelievable. Many of the script elements are unbelievable (a pig on a roof?) One would expect to be able to count on the Dukes to, at the very least, deliver interesting car stunts. Alas, no, not here. I wasn't expecting anything very good from this, but I wasn't expecting to be so bored either."
3,Well........it was OKAY!,"When I bought this soundtrack, I was only relly buying it for Thomas Newman's amazing title theme tune and the remixes. But i saw the rest of the tracks and though I would give them a try. They were OKAY! Not great buy just okay. None of them where erally that good, but some of them where nice, one in particular being The Dandy Warhols ""Bohemian Like You"". Its worth buying if you like Thomas Newman...but apart from than, it's not really THAT appealing!"
5,very informative but too violent for young children,"I purchased this documentary for my 8 eight year old son. He has read all the Percy Jackson novels and is now heavily into greek mythology. Of course this otherwise excellent documentary was not made for children. It depicts rather violent scenes and it's descriptions of heros, monsters and demigods fueled my sons imagination. It is an excellent documentary, researching the possible origins for myths, but to be viewed with caution when children are around.My son still loved it, and it did trigger continuative discussions in our family!"
5,A Classic For the Generations,"My mother gave me this book when I was twelve, a copy she had received when she was around the same age. I am twenty-three now and it is still my favorite book of all-time. You cannot help but love the laughing Gardner boys and root for Martitia as she struggles to overcome her faults and become a true Gardner daughter. It's a story with a lot of heart and character, and one I will most certainly be passing on to my children."
5,Historical fiction for pre-teens with a plot that keeps you guessing,"I first read this book myself in the 50's. Was never able to find it for my kids, but am happy that I will have it for my grandaughters. it holds up well, and provides an interesting picture of pre-Civil War farm life, along the lines of the Little House books, with a plot that is entertaining."
2,"Impossible to ""get into""","After reading all the positive reviews on this book I was looking forward to getting it, but didn't care for the style, the characters, or the go-nowhere plot and abandoned it about halfway through."
1,Boring and excessively wordy,"I had to read this for a class (that was out of my major). So I guess I'm not really in the target audience. If you like reading sentences like:""In this reverberation, the poetic image will have a sonority of being.""Then you'll probably like this book. By the way, this is from the second page of the book, so the author hasn't really defined what he means by ""reverberation"" and ""sonority of being"" yet. As far as I can tell, he never really defined any of these terms (other than in some mushy mashy way invoking a bunch of other weird terms that I didn't understand).I dunno, maybe I'm too simple a man to enjoy this stuff. I guess if you are considering buying it, you should go read the book preview. The entire book sounds exactly like so if you can stand that style, then I guess there are some insights to be had in there. But to me it all just came off as academic sophistry."
5,A book to savor .......,"........ this book is about house and its space and remembrance and meaning. House as protector, memory store, place in the world, construct. This is a philosophy book about house written by a poet, reflecting his views, and other's, on the importance and vital organism that is shelter. If you love word that conjures thought...and love home (whatever that means for you) I believe you will savor this book."
5,bachelard y los arquetipos poéticos,"La Poética del espacio proporciona a los estudiosos de la poesía una clave insuperable de análisis. La imaginaión poética del espacio se aplica a las escalas y los grados de intimidad, alcanzando el estatus del aqruetipo y el símbolo."
1,A terrible book.,"Sorry to those people that have got something out of this book, but I couldn't finish it. I found myself reading slabs of this turgid mess to my family, so they could laugh at the meaningless passages. It is self indulgent twaddle."
3,Wrong part,"I received the mirror 1 day before it was promised which was great. The problem was that it was the wrong part. The web site said that the part number I ordered would fit my 2004 Jeep Wrangler but when I received it, the package said it would fit up to a 2000 Wrangler. It was obviously the wrong mirror for my Jeep.I have returned it for a refund."
1,Double check this one,Received both mirrors broken....which turned out to be a blessing because these are not for a 98 wrangler....but they were returned for credit without objection....
5,Potent! Great product as long as it is taken in moderation!,"I had used another ginseng liquid product for years with average effects/results. I bought this on Amazon just to try another ginseng product. Action Labs Ginseng Power Max 4 X, 2-Ounce exceeded my expectations. It is quite potent---one dropper is enough to eliminate fatigue at the end of a long tiring day. On days when I take it in the morning, it gives the extra pep required to manage the stress of the workplace. On the downside, when I tried two droppers full, it made me over-stimulated and I was unable to get a proper sleep. Great product as long as it is taken in moderation. I am currently on bottle 2, and I have a third bottle in stock. I will most definitely buy when all my bottles run out."
2,There are much better books on execution than this,"This is not a SCHOLARLY book on execution. Also it is submerged so much in detail that the author often misses his points. The book is more on interpersonal relations, communications, managing people kind of thing and very very basic. If you have some managerial experience and knowledge and know just a little about execution, you should definitely skip this book and go for some serious ones, like the one by Kaplan and Norton."
4,Maxxum 7D Vertical Battery Grip,"I also have a Maaxxum 9 and purchased the vertical grip for it. I feel the vertical grip is an essential accessory.The reason I didn't give a 5 rating is because the hand strap didn't come with the VC-7D Grip. I don't understand why because the hand strap came with Maxxum 9 vertical grip. You'd think that for $200 they would at least give you the hand strap, now wouldn't you!"
4,A good puzzle glue,"This puzzle glue does exactly what you want. I applied one coat, let it dry and then applied a second, just to make sure that no pieces fell off of my puzzle later. It comes with it's own brush which also makes things easy. So far I have used it on a 1000 piece puzzle, and half of the bottle is still left. I highly recommend this puzzle glue."
4,it Works,"I was surprised.You have to take your time and paint over every piece and where they connect.I had to go over my daughter's puzzle twice. Once it dries, you don't see it and the puzzle keeps together."
2,Much better on stage,"It was fair, but I saw the production twice years ago on stage, and the film is just very different, even though some of the songs are the same. With the exception of ""How can People be so Heartless"" sung beautifully, the rest of the film was dull and boring. Also difficult to understand the lyrics and some of the dialogue.Actually, I don't remember very much spoken dialogue in the show itself. Imo, sub-titles were needed for this film because often the music, lyrics and dialogue were so muddled it became quite difficult to make out what was going on and what was being sung or spoken. I guess if you've seen the show the movie is something entirely different in presentation. It's just not the same even though the spirit of the film is trying hopelessly to be present. It's just not. I tried to exchange it for another disk, hoping at least the sub-titles would work, because they didn't work on my disk, but Amazon wouldn't do an exchange. Don't know why."
3,Having acted Hair.. the movie seems too shallow,"As a child of the 60's (1963) I never had the chance to see the plays that must have touched sensitive if not censored issues revolving around those days.. I had the chance of playing it in english here in Caracas in 1983 while in my early 20's.., by going ove the script and the music I got an appreciation for the depth of the play and its musical mastery!! well even in 1983 the director's decided to censor certain ""nationalistic"" questionings.. so I still hope that sometime I will get a full non-censured performance, is that too much to ask of life?After this introduction I was excited on seeing the movie.. and what a disappointment, both musically as well as in performance.. and censored!!!! In the play we made people cry at Bergers death..in here, well see for yourself"
4,Depending on the Players,This is a GREAT game for someone who likes to goof off with their friends. It requires being silly and active. It is not a game for people who are embarrassed to act. It's like Charades with props.It is very fun for families or friends.
2,8 yr old liked them but overwhelming prune taste.,"I love fig bars but was disappointed by these. Had strong prune taste, however my 8 yr old son like them. Love other Barbara's items."
1,not very good cop drama,This review is for the Amazon VOD rental of this film. I rented this filmbecause I haved always enjoyed Wings Hauser playing a tough guy cop in theselow budget crime dramas. Hauser directs this film and is listed as the starbut he is barely in the movie. The two male leads act like low rent rejectsfrom Miama Vice. If you like action flicks or are a Hauser fan look to hisother films. This movie is just not very good.
1,MUMMY LAID AN EGG,"This book written to explain reproduction to little children states that mothers have eggs in their belly buttons and daddy's have seeds in sacks. It also has silly illustrations of people copulating on skate boards, bouncy balls, and wearing clown hats. I would not recommend this book on any level."
5,Ignore the ignoramuses,"The book is a hoot for exactly the reasons that the previous reviewers complain: the sense of irony that the children are more sophisticated and lessafraid of the subject than the parents (which the reviews bare out). The pictures are clever and if your fifth grade child is shocked by it, you've been sheltering him or her too long. It is a fun and non-threatening way to introduce the topic of reproduction to small kids and the illustrations are great tooI imagine some Church group got its members to write all the negative reviews en masse while their kids are out in back reading Hustler."
1,Whoa! Too much sex-ed for little ones!,"The premise of this book was great, but the kiddie ""how to"" drawings are a bit much. I don't want to hand my kids illustrations of how they and their friends can play mommy and daddy. I think the author was way out of line creating this book for children. It borders on kiddie-drawn porn. As an adult joke book it's great (I actually ended up giving my copy to a friend's mom and we had a great laugh), but I would never show this to my children. Granted, it's not the Joy of Sex, but close enough. It is disturbing to think people show their kids how to copulate on skateboards, bouncers, etc. I do not shy away from discussing the real mechanics of sex with my kids, but stop short of a full demonstration! Also, the messiness of the family and house are unsettling. Why the author chose to show trash, mice, and old food in the living room is beyond me. I come from good hippy-stock and living in filth was never part of my liberal up bringing."
1,PORN 4 KIDS...Awful!,"Stick figure porn that is. Stick figures having sex upside down, on a skateboard with text such as ""here are some ways...mommies and daddies fit together"" - Like I want my child to know of different ways have sex?!The author, Babette Cole clearly has issues (probably a fairy believing Mom that believes in free speech and loving every neighbor as your own husband, oh and I would bet money she thinks we walked the earth with dinosaurs, as Sarah Palin believes).Other info in the book isn't so bad, but the pictorials are enough to generate a 1 out of 5. It issadc to think that people have these kind of values."
4,great book,"Dave's right, this book really does have something for any hot rod fan. It really spans the range of styles! Great photos."
2,"The book is better than the movie, as usual","You gotta love this flick, if only because Robert O'Brien's book is an absolute classic, and it's actually pulled off pretty well here. Of the three big animation houses these days (house of Disney, house of Bakshi, house of Bluth), I've always thought Bluth's animators were third-best, but after a while you forget that and get caught up in the story. Still, you're probably better off reading the book, unless you get a perverse thrill from hearing the voices of a ten-year-old Shannen Doherty and an eleven-year-old Wil Wheaton. * 1/2"
5,A Masterpiece and a cornerstone of my heart,"I would simply say this: -This movie is the best animated film ever produced. -I belong to the following it has generated. -I worship Don Bluth -I am writing a fan fiction novel, based on the movie(and book) -I keep all three books and the DVD at my desk at all times. -This movie is a part of me, without it, i would be nothing."
2,Magic spoils the movie.,"This movie makes fundamental departures from the book, adding magic spoils it. Jeremy the crow is just plain annoying. My 4 year old likes it, so I can't give it one star. But if you've actually read the book, this pales in comparison, and not simply in the way that most movies are not as good as the book. It could have been so much better, but it has so much nonsense."
3,This isn't the best version available.,"First off, let me say that I watched this movie as a very young child, and am very much a purist where movies are concerned. The silver U/A logo from the 70's and early 80's is a part of the movie in my opinion and it is a part of my experience in watching the film whenever I go back to it. I find it nostalgic and valuable...and THIS DVD VERSION REPLACED IT!The 2008 2-Disc release, however, put it back the way it was.The Secret of NIMH (2-Disc Family Fun Edition)I UTTERLY DESPISE when movie companies defile cinema by deliberately re-branding their films to match the current time period, or latest bastardization of their company name from some merger that always happens every 5-10 years. Leave the films ALONE!This version is also ONLY in 4:3 for older televisions (no 16:9 widescreen version on this disc). Other than that, the quality is satisfactory. Buy this version if you simply don't care."
3,Movie is 5 Stars But FOX dropped the Ball BIg Time on This Re-Release!,"Fox is finally giving fans a Special Edition of this MGM Catalog title. Using rehashed artwork instead of the Original Poster Artwork that was always much cooler. They are calling it a Family Fun Edition unfortunalty those of us who gree up on the film are older now. 25th Anniversary Edition Would have been more fitting. Would have been cool to have somethign about Jerry Goldmsith as composer bonus feature/ Trailers also. Some details have surfaced about the set but the good stuf we'd like are sacrificed for sorry to say but mediocre ""kid"" games that are and will always be filler and a waste of resources. We want Film stuff not a 10 min. Featurette on the film It deserves something much longer. They will be deleted scenes and commentary from Don Bluth and Gary Goldman. This film still deserves better. Kids can buy the bare bones movie only us collectors want somethign more."
4,Visiting childhood again . . .,This is an animated piece that has different messages for adults and children. One sees the problems in society and the other sees the suspense facing a family disrupted by loss and disruption of home life. Little bit of everything and very well done.
5,good business,VHS played perfectly and the box was in good shape as stated in description. Lovely doing business with this person! =)
3,Kind of grainy,"Ordered this along with Fantasia on Blu-ray. I know that Disney Blu-rays have a larger budget to remaster their movies, but this was a little dissappointing. Extremely grainy film transfer from the original. Haven't watched a pre Blu-ray version of Nimh in a while, but I don't remember it looking this harsh. Would think that if the studio was going to go through the trouble of doing a tranfer, they would do some picture correction. Movie is still good, just wish they had put more effort in."
2,BORING...,this movie stunk. I remembered it as a child being good... what have I been smoking??? this is boring and have watched it once. I guess i may have been spoiled by the quality of the recent animation.
3,Falls short of the mark.,"I remember O'Brien's novel as being a charming and well-written tale. If you haven't read the novel then you could easily watch this film all the way through and be left wondering ""what the hell was all that about?"" The voices are excellent and there's no doubting the visual style and wonderfully dark, gritty atmosphere which sets it apart from Disney's twee offerings, but it comes across as rather disjointed and underdeveloped. Some of the attempts at humour are also rather less than successful - ""look, mother, it's another turkey"".Watchable, but if you're looking for serious animal-based animation of this kind then 'Watership Down' and 'Animal Farm' are far more worthwhile."
1,can this aspect ratio be correct?,"i want to purchase this film in the blu-ray format,but the aspect ratio is listed as 1.33.1.Just say it isn't so!If treating purchaser's with contempt is the aim of the studio's,they are doing a good job!Amazon should not be complicit in this. The correct aspect ratio that the film was filmed in should be HIGHLIGHTED.A modified aspect ratio should say MODIFIED.Studio's will soon get the message."
5,a classic for the ages,"There's not much you can actually say but ""Wow"". This movie was perfectly acted and written. It was a great movie that I will be sure to watch over and over. If you havn't seen it and are reading these to find out if you should, go now!"
5,Worth seeing over and over,"Dustin Hoffman plays a very convincing role as a man with autism. And, Tom Cruise is always good. I am taking a Special Education course and watching several movies regarding people with disabilities was required, and this movie was on the list. I have seen it before, but am glad i had the opportunity to watch it again. Highly recommended."
5,RAIN MAN is the all time movie,"you could not ask for a better classic movie... rainman is the most amazing funny movie ever, tis one of my favs. dustan hoffman is the best.. i love all his movies"
3,Kmart sucks Ray....,"I love this movie! I had bought this as a gift for a friend because I couldn't find it in any stores around here. I ordered it online and what do you know, they have it in the $5 bin at Target. I was a bit upset with the price, but I'll survive I guess. LOL"
4,SCREAM 4: A FRESH RETURN TO WOODSBORO,"It's been 11 years since the last scream came out, and although scream 3 wasn't bad, it did not live up to the first two. Going into this, I was a little skeptic at first, but when I saw the Kevin Williamson was returning to write It, I got higher hopes. Scream 4 reunites all of our favorite former characters (Sidney, Gale, and Dewey), in Woodsboro for another fun senseless bloodbath. With the kills being suprising and keeping you on your feet, the film also has a ton of dark humor and a nice homage to recent horror films. Some of the teenagers are a bit annoying, but hay, that's what makes it so much fun when they get killed right? All in all, it's not quite as good as the first two, but it's better then the third and a nice, fresh return from Wes Craven and Kevin Williamson."
2,I think they should have stopped the series earlier,I didn't know they made a scream 4. They really shouldn't have. I think three was enough. Unless you're a huge fan skip it.
2,I can see why but please stop,"I should have known this was going to be bad when the theater made us wait for the next viewing because the projector not working. Owning the first 3 in the series I was wanting to see how this would go. ""Sid grows up but the killing are still happening idea"" the idea was good but the way they went about it was bad. Being a fan of the first 3 I was immediately drawn into how gail, dewey and sid would get through the film, so when all of these ""newbies"" started to die I really did not care as I had no interest in seeing them. So when the reveal was made, sure it was someone unexpected but they made it come off as stupid with the self inflicting of injuries.Plus at the end the tradional attack on Dewey was so weak compared to the other movies. Again I can see why they did it from a story standpoint and yes I will more then likely buy the dvd just to complete the collection but please go no further."
4,Nothing really new but still fun,"The original is still the best, but this is a nice homage not only to the other Scream films but to horror films in general, esp. the postmodern kind. Great guest appearances abound, from Kristen Bell and Anna Paquin to Aimee Teegarden and more."
2,Personal Option!,"Everythings Already Been Done, Only Reason I Gave It 2 Stars Is Because Wes Craven Did Write It, and They Used The Beverly Hills Cop Theme As Dewys Ring Tone. Buy It Used Its Only A Time Waster Compared To Scream 1, 2, and Even The Rediculas Part 3. Lame Ending."
3,Scream 4,"I enjoyed Scream 4. It was a fun ride that I would say is worth seeing. However, it is not as scary and as good as the first scream. Too many jokes and comic relief are all over this film. (Begin SPOILER)... Right before the cop dies, he says ""f*** Bruce Willis""...(END SPOILER)....kind of ruins the horror because most people getting attacked would not say that. I know scream isn't something that should be perfect and a lot of it isn't realistic; but some of the lines and situations went against the scary affect. I would say its not crap so I would give it a chance."
3,Here We Go Again,"Well really, how much more can they do with this movie? Many complained about this movie, but it was okay for me. I really do think the way Gale was protrayed, showed they were out of ideas with her character. Didn't like her irrational behavior throughout the movie. Dewey was his usual nerdy personality. I did feel that Dewey's female partner was a bit looney at times. She had a huge crush on Dewey, which was weird. Some of the other actors were just your average teenage victims waiting for the usual kill. Nothing exciting in particular with their performances. Neve Campbell didn't add anything extra special to her part. Now she was grown up and came back to a town that had horrible memories for her to promote her new book. Why would anyone in their right mind want to do that?I didn't really expect anything out of the ordinary with this installment. I thought the movie was mostly true to its beginnings. Now there was a new psycho in town."
2,"No, no, NO!!!!!!","Why are you people giving this movie such good reviews?!?!? Seriously, ""Scream 4"" SUCKS!I am a huge fan of the original ""Scream"" trilogy. Admittedly, the first movie was much better than the second and third, but ""Scream 4"" makes 2 and 3 seem Oscar worthy. You would think that Wes Craven had enough time to come up with a good script, but he so DID NOT. Yes, it is fun to see all these characters again, and it's fun to see a couple of currently popular actresses that I hate get butchered on screen, but the enjoyment ends there. This movie is all over the place. I don't think enough time is devoted to the original three characters. I also think the overall plot is SUPER lame. All of the new characters are incredibly annoying, and there just isn't anything redeemable about this movie AT ALL. What a disappointment. Don't waste your money seeing this in the theatres."
1,Does Not Even Deserve 1 Star,"OMG, this song never ends! Britney whines about how she cheated on some guy, then complains that he left her. Great song, huh? She sings in this bizarre high-pitched voice that annoys the heck out of me and I mysekf could of written the pathetic lyrics ""And this song's my sorry""! Since when has ""sorry"" been a noun?! Oh, well. She is a high-school drop-out, after all."
2,tough to read,wasn't what i expected. haven't been able to finish it. maybe i'll start it again sometime
1,1 Star,"I have listen to this one lately and feel it sounds the same as other attempts to record music. Very good guitar technique, but there is no feeling beyond the notes played. A few songs have hope, but in general this CD bores me. No excitiment mentally, no real feeling. While I was listening to this CD, I was expecting to hear growth, and mature expression. Not found here. The only thing found in this CD is guitar licks that are really good and that you can learn to impress your friends, but nothing to seperates it from other guitar artists at all. This CD is a waste of ear time."
3,good cd,"I think i've finnally found a new guitar hero in eric johnson, his playing is so diffrent and fresh from what i'm used to. This cd was made the 80's and it shows, alot of the songs are very similar to that of pop/rock genres of the 80's, but of course with the addition of amazing guitar playing. Overall I wish he included more instrumental songs like 'cliffs of dover' and 'trademark' and lost the vocals completly. That is why this cd loses 2 stars."
2,"A few hot licks, but that's it.","He is a great guitarist, but this recording is of a very mediocre quality. I remember it being much better 20 years ago when it was originally released. Maybe this was a lower grade pressing done with cheaper equipment. I don't know what the problem is, though it's obvious there is one. Also, the cd jewel case arrived broken in a few places. This doesn't matter much, but with the sound quality issues it kind of completes the whole dissapointing package. This is a shame because the guitar playing on this album deserves better treatment from the production side of things."
1,A Book With No Ending. A true Let Down,"Like many others, I got this as a Daily Deal. When I read this book, I felt it was rather disjointed, but was sure it would come together at the end. What a joke that thought was. There is no ending!! Seems as if I have to purchase another book to get that ending .. or will I have to buy a third one??? Not unless it also will be a Daily Deal. I love to read but this is the first time I have read a book with no ending. There are many, many authors who write series (Robin Carr, Debbie Macomber, Catherine Coulter to name a few) who finish each book with an ending and leave us wanting more of their work. I have most of the books they have written and can hardly wait for more.Would I recommend this book? .... No Way!!! Would I recommend this author? .... No Way!!! I truly feel as if I got ripped off."
2,What the hell happened to Coppolla and Puzo?,"Something must have gone wrong with Coppolla and Puzo after seeing this film; it totally ruined the Godfather series. I don't know why they bothered to make this film anyway. Part 2 was practically the end. Part 3 seemed like a non-significant extention. What was the real plot? Whatever it was, it didn't live up to the word ""Godfather"". GF3 broke all the traditions the first 2 had: a Mafia-storyline, Mafia music, etc. Obviously the weakest of the trilogy, Godfather Part 3 was a complete disaster, and there no point for this film to have been even started."
1,Horrible!,"The first two Godfather movies were excellent. Masterpieces. But this one was a complete and total failure. Some have tried to review it ""on its own terms."" I cannot do this; it is part of a series and it must be reviewed as the final installment of that series.The plot is absurd. Michael Corleone wants to go completely legit by buying some Vatican-owned company. Then, the pope and some corrupt bishops get thrown into the mess. Add to this his daughter (horrible actress playing her part), his son (what a puss), and his ex-wife trotting around (give me a break) Italy with him and you have a real loser on your hands.This movie has nothing of the magic that made the first 2 so great. I wouldn't recommend this to anyone who hasn't seen it. The first two Godfather movies suffice.As the climax of this trilogy, one would have expected much, much more. Instead, you get 3 hours of yawns, boredom, and unrequited dreams of the movie getting better."
3,2.5 stars out of 4,"The Bottom Line:Convoluted and overlong, The Godfather Part III should be commended for trying to tell a different story (I and II were essentially two parts of the same tale) and for its several powerful scenes, but it's too messy a film to be worth recommending, and that's not mentioning the unimpressive turn by Sofia Coppola."
1,what happened?,You have 2 of the best movies ever created in Godfather 1 and 2 and then you get this one. I don't want to know why this happened. Very unfortunate that this was ever created.
1,very weak,this film falls so far below the first two it's a shame.only Andy Garcia Pumps any new Life into this film.everything else is very tired & cliched.compared to GoodFellas this film looks like a 2nd rate tv movie of the week.George Hamilton in a film? that alone drops the respect factor down.Soffia Coppola can't act out of a paper bag.as Great as the first two are is as Horrible this one is.
1,Pan the Tan Man,"Allowing George Hamilton to have ANY part in this film was enough to downgrade it to 1-star! What potential, yet unrealized brilliance this movie represents! Apparently by the time it wrapped, Coppola had completely moved on to the wine business......."
4,Pacino's Voice Hurts Connectio,"I loved the first two movies, and this is solid, but one of the things that hurts is the change in Pacino's voice. He is a great actor, but for some reason, this bothered me."
3,"Good, but CANT compare to the first 2","I am a Godfather fanatic and watched each..to say that the third one is a total and complete disappointment is not right. I admit, there were times were the movie plot dragged on and the acting was confusing (mostly by amateurs NEVER Al Pacino)..EVEN thru all the flaws i have to say it was good because is was a continuation of the Godfather I and II, and it led us to see the whereabouts of our favourite and powerful Don Michael Corleone. Anyone who is a true Godfather fan has to give III some applause for the ending...Al Pacino was sooo good in the one, especially the last scene :)..totally oscar worthy...however his Italian dubbing was really crappy and they could have done a better job disregarding the fact he doesnt know any..watch it"
2,Doesn't measure up,"This movie was a bomb. I rated it 2 stars only out of respect for Pacino and the rest of the family. Unfortunately the movies has to be seen if you are a fan of the godfather series, which most people are. However this movie was a huge mistake by Coppola, what was he thinking. Pacino made this movie shorly after Dick Tracy and in many scenes he looks and sounds like the character he played in that movie. The movie was very painful for me, as a huge fan of the first two movies. Pacino lived in some apartment like building, which I never figured out why. Connie (Shire) was left to call some of the shots on hits and other things, which was weak. The weakest however was the scene at the opera which draged on longer than any other scene in my memory, what a bore. What a shame this movie was, I think Coppola should come out and say he blew part three and has decided to redo it...."
2,A sad ending to an otherwise great series,"Compared to the first two movies, The Godfather III was a disappointment. The plot was difficult to follow, the acting was often poor, and the writing was tortured. Worst of all was the daughter, who had no chemistry with any other character, least of all her lover/cousin. When she died, my immediate reaction was, ""That might actually save the movie."" Then the movie ended, and my thought was, ""That's probably best - this movie wasn't worth saving."""
3,Flawed but a well done Gangster film,"I admit I love this movie because of the actors and the characters they played. I love mobster films as much as anyone here. I love Al Pacino he is so good in this film but the person that really sparked was Andy Garcia playing Vincent as cold, violent, emotional gangster who was being advised by Michael Corleone in a well deserved Oscar Nomination. Even though he might not have won the oscar especially Best Picture it is still worth seeing despite Sofia Coppola being a bad actress as she is before being an Oscar Winning Screenwriter for Lost In Translation (2004). People say that this insults Catholics. I am Catholic and I was not really insulted. For the lesson in this movie forgiveness and redemption is really hard to find especially to your family. It is ironic about AL pacino and ANdy Garcia in this film because they were both nominated in the same category; Andy Garcia for Godfather PArt III and AL Pacino for Dick Tracy."
5,Ignore the half-wits who didn't understand this movie,"Godfather 3 is a masterpiece, pure and simple, far surpassing its morally bankrupt predecessors. Anyone who says otherwise has no understanding of character, theme and plotting, has no knowledge whatsoever of recent European history (the Vatican bank scandal,the suspected poisoning of John Paul I, Roberto Calvi etc) and can safely be ignored. A very nice day to you all."
2,Let's wrap it up,"To be honest, I saw this one on television, a big fan on numbers 1 and 2. I wasnt too crazy about this one as it seemed rather drawn out and the cast not as ""giant"" as the others. However, owning 1 and 2 I wanted to ""wrap it up"" and have the complete set. This purchase is worth it for that reason but of itself alone, buy the other two."
2,Worth seeing once....but only once,"It's all been said before- this movie suffers from a confusing and weak plot, poor casting, some really bad acting, and...worst of all...a guy getting it on with his cousin (yuck). There are a handful of powerful scenes, such as Michael Corleone's emotional confession to the future Pope John Paul I, and his reaction to his daughter's death, but all in all, it's almost a parody of the first two Godfather films."
3,A Paradox Indeed,"I salute Barry Schwartz for tackling a subject which is at the heart of so much of the current malaise of modern American consumer culture. However, I find it interesting how Schwartz underscores the whole 'overabundance-of-choice dilemma' by deluging the reader with an exhaustive taxology of somewhat self-evident examples and a litany of academic studies. A healthy dose of humor and more informal slice of rich anectodes might have illuminated the subject, but instead Schwartz laboriously overstates his 'too-much-choice-is-bad' thesis ad infinitum--the irony is that her 'over-chose' his material."
1,The Paradox of Schwartz,"If Mr. Schwartz really believed what he writes, he wouldn't write. There are, by his depiction of things, too many choices. For example, there are far too many books. By writing another book, he aggravates the problem while pretending to solve it. In reality, we filter out most choices and focus on just a few. There are 6+ billion people, so we could marry any one of say, 3 billion. We select from a far smaller number and are not distressed about the billions we never met."
3,Worth the quick read,"The point of the book is interesting and warrants the read, but it is a bit redundant at times. The biggest takeaway for me was the idea of a satisficer versus a maximizer. Although, the book seems to argue being a satisficer is the optimal choice, I can't help but believe it is best to be a combination of both. There are certain decisions in life when being a maximizer is simply foolish. For example, deciding which soap to buy. Clearly this is a decision not worth pouring over all of the available options and their respective pros and cons. However, there are other decisions in life where it is best to be a maximizer. Choosing where to go to school, which profession to pursue, who your doctor should be, etc. I believe the big decisions in life should be made with the mindset of a maximizer. The little choices we make day-to-day are understandably best made as a satisficer."
2,"Has lots of names, very few meanings","This book is just ok. Though it has lots of names, almost every name says ""see this name"" under the meaning. It gets very frustrating! So if you care what your child's name means, this book will drive you crazy! Pregnant hormones are enough right?If you just want a list, I wouldn't even recommend it, I love The Baby Name Wizard. It doesn't have meanings, but it has fun lists and cool info like ""sibling names"" that go with it. You'll need another book for meanings, but its fun and different.This book has NOT earned the title VERY BEST. Not at all."
5,love love love,"I actually purchased this book twice once for me and once for my friend I love the top names categories, twin section, by syllable section and unique or common names highly recommend"
4,Good book for those who enjoy searching,"This is the only book I bought when I was pregnant with my daughter and the only one I am using now to find a name for baby #2. This is a great book if you enjoy searching through names and their variations. I wanted to see as many realistic names as possible and I knew I wanted an uncommon, but not weird, name. It also lists the ethnicity of the name and its variations. My only complaint (and I have an old version of the book, so this may have changed) is that the book does not lay out the pronunciation of the names. Overall, I love this book and searching through it."
5,This was our favorite,"Picking a baby name is a very personal process and everyone approaches it differently. We were given four or five baby name books, and this was the one we found most complete and helpful.I suggest getting several books, including this one, and just enjoy looking through them and getting ideas. Don't worry too much about what a name ""means"", it varies from book to book and country to country, and no one will know it anyway.And don't worry if your name is or isn't on a ""Top 10"" list. The only list that matters is your baby's!"
4,"The Spirit of America ""Daniel Rodriguez""","When I first heard people talking about this singing policeman, I thought ""right"" he is just a man who sings, and so happens to be a policeman.But, I ordered the tape anyway before I actually heard him sing. What a surprise! Daniel Rodriquez's voice is wonderful. And of course it reminds you of Septemeber 11th, and the tragedy that fell apon America that day. His singing comforts the soul, and makes you feel united with the ones who suffered the most loss that day, and makes you proud even more to be an American. If Daniel Rodriquez cuts another album, I would certainly purchase it. He has a delightful voice, as good as any opera star I've listened to. What a treasure he is."
3,Was hoping for more.,"I was a really huge fan of Kyra Davis' first book called 'Sex, Murder And A Double Latte', so of course I had to read the sequel. I have to say I found myself not liking this one as well as the first. It was a little repetitive and wasn't all too exciting to me. Maybe if there'll be a third in the series it will be more like the first."
4,books,"Passion, Betrayal and Killer Highlights is the second in a series of books by Kyra Davis.A fun read for sure. Not your typical mystery."
4,Gale Harold gives a great persormance,"I was curious to see Gale Harold perform as a very different character from Brain (from the amazing ""Queer As Folk"" TV series) and was not let down. Gale is a great actor and gave a great performance. The movie is dark, disturbing at some points, defiantly not ""entertainment"" but well done. I think I need to watch it again to be aware of more details and symbols. Overall I'm glad I bought it."
3,Entertaining but context free,"I feel like slaming this book. It contains a series of lightly connected stories. There is very little real information about what went wrong with the project or anything else. However, it is interesting; I read it in two sittings. My advise is to check it out of the library in a year or two. Don't spend money on this book."
1,A disappointment - sorry.,"I'm a huge fan of David's, love his unbelievable creativity and most of all, his ability to blend music and sounds that sweep over you and draw you into his vision. But for me, this CD was a bust. It's really nothing but a collection of chiming, tingling, and (yes) mystical sound effects. No real music. It just drones on and on. Something you'd hear playing in the background of a fortune teller's shop, to be sure. Sorry to disagree with those 5 star ratings, but before you buy this CD, I suggest you listen to it completely to be sure it's what you think it is."
3,OK,It's okay. But this my last order ever from Amazon. I would cancel it if I could. No guts Amazon for cutting Wikileaks loose under pressure from Lieberman. No matter how you feel about Wikileaks this was a very stupid decision.
3,It serves its purpose,"Needed a replacement mirror for my RH mirror that got mosaic-ed by a poorly placed trash can on my street. This product arrived very quickly as well as it being free shipping when I did purchase it, however, it is a slightly off version of the mirror on my truck. The horizontal angle of the mirror to my truck is a little tighter than the original and the vertical angle is higher as well. I'm not terribly concerned with exact symmetry but I am a little put off by the fact that the odd design forced me to position the mirror in a very extreme fashion that it is almost hanging outside of the casing. But like I said, it works. I honestly would have given this product a 3.5 or 4 but that odd angle still bugs the crap out of me."
5,"FUN Game, Great for counting, playing fair","Great game for girls and boys to play together. Great for counting, following directions and playing together. Highly recommend this classic game. I ended up purchasing two so another family and children can continue playing this game."
2,Letdown,"I'm a huge R.E. fan, but can't understand how he could produce such a generic c.d. . "" JUMPIN OFF"" and ""CHILL FACTOR"" are both outstanding sets with funk, soul, great production , and magic. This disc is uninteresting drivel.There are literally no really good cuts on this one. PLease Richard , get back that magic for the next disc. Pass on this one and get the last two."
1,Eh,"I don't like this game at all. It's boring, and if you can't think of answers for a while, then you want to leave, which is exactly what I did and why I'm writing this review. I can't stand it. The concept is so-so, but the game isn't. It's is so slow, and the people I play with never seem to be having fun, they just finish to find out if they'll win or not. BORING....."
2,Use real Scrabble and give kids a handicap like in golf,"We've always pulled our 8 and up kids into adult Scrabble games, and just calculated a reasonable handicap for them. The adults are more willing to play with the kids if we aren't forced to play a kiddie version, and the kids get some exposure to a broader vocabulary right from the start. They're very proud of lowering their handicap over time too."
2,Not for young children,"We had the Hermie book and absolutely love it and when we ordered this, thinking it would be great for young kids, it is NOT. I would say it is appropriate for kids in middle school. It is very deceiving by the cover. I was so hoping it would be a bible for little ones with all the fun bug characters we love, but it was not."
3,it should been pads of 20's,3 and 1/2 Stars even though you get 80 pagesthe disapointed for this someone else I know thought you get 4 pads of 20's not one pad of 80'smy recomendation can go ether way
1,Doesn't fit,These vent shades do not fit a quad cab even though the Website claimed that they would fit a 2005 Dodge Ram quad cab. I had to return them.
5,"Spooky South: Tales Of Hauntings,Strange Happenings,and Other Local Lore",My daughter received this paperback as a Christmas from me. She found it to be really interested! I look forward to reading it!
2,Good,"This is good for storytelling, but as for the story, I've heard a lot of these, researched some (the Bell Witch) and the stories in this book are recreations. I'm only giving 2 stars due to that there was a lot of good research, but a lot of liberty taken with the stories and their outcome.This one is a lot of fun for people who don't care about how true the story is to the original, but don't take it as solid references for paper-writing on folklore."
4,His greatness is not revealed here,One of Joyce's great heroes was Ibsen who he corresponded with. But drama was not to be the form that Joyce excelled in. It is possible to argue that the 'Nighttown dialogue' of Ulysses is one of its weakest chapters. In his play 'Exiles' which is a kind of love triangle drama built around Joyce's imaginings of a wife's betrayal of her husband the drama does not come to life. And so the work has interest primarily because it is another work of the great genius Joyce.
2,The Search for the Iceman,"Another 48 Hours, 1990 filmThey say the sequel usually isn't as good as the original. This is not an exception to that rule. The reason is the story. Overall it is an interesting plot, but seems to intense at times. It has a lot of action and killing, maybe too much for a mystery story. Who is the ""Iceman"", the person behind the illegal drug trade in the San Francisco area? The answer lies in uncovering his identity. The original seems to have more humor. This one seems to have too many cardboard characters. The final scenes have a lot of shooting, as if that alone would make a better movie. The premise of this story seems unbelievable to me.The lack of daylight scenes outside of the desert suggests a low budget production. I don't think there will be another sequel. Note how their looks tell about the characters, as if that was true in reality."
4,i must say da 1st half of da film was eddie at his absolute finest while da second half was another story,da first half of da movie was funny filled with action pack scenes but i didn't no what happen 2 da second part this movie was on its way 2 being a classic 4 me what happen toward da 2nd half is something i will never know
2,Boring Ending....And Not A Surprise,"This American version of the movie too predictable. Doesn't fit the title of ""suspense."" If you want a TRUE thriller, buy the Dutch version of this movie! That version is captioned, but you are so taken in by the storyline, you won't even realize it. The American version of ""The Vanishing"" was softened up for American audiences.....the Dutch version is not, and the ending is even more shocking!"
5,Disturbing,"The people who made this music obviously have something wrong with them. Yes, they've written an array of wildly inventive songs and play the living kreplach out of them, often in blistering fashion. But then they take these twisted, yet salacious musings and infuse them with a multi-layered sonic sound collage than can only be described as aggressive. I believe this aural sabatoge is the work of one Danny Freeman, a so-called ""Producer/Engineer"" who has been known to severely tamper with the recorded sounds of such bands as ""The Flaming Lips"" & ""Mercury Rev"", to name a few. I'm not sure what this Freeman character is trying to prove, but I wish he'd just get back in his celestial hovercraft and return to the 58th dimension where he belongs."
5,The Two Conservatisms,"Eugene Genovese must be the most interesting writer inAmerica. This New York-born professed Marxist analyzesconservatism more thoroughly and respectfully than many conservatives do. And one cannot grasp the antebellum South, which he treats just as respectfully, without him. In this little book, Genovese effectively argues that Southern conservatism is different from, and occasionally hostile to, what most people think of as conservatism. Southern conservatives are conservatives of community and tradition rather than Limbaughian market worshippers. Essential."
3,My first Elmore Leonard,"Having seen most of the films based on his novels (my favorite being Out of Sight and my least favorite being a tough choice between Touch and 52 Pick-up) I was looking forward to reading this novel and getting a first hand look at his style. Elmore Leonard spins a fun and brisk yarn and his charcaters banter with the best of them. This was the perfect airport book. All style with little depth, this was an entertaining book with a lot of fun details about the LA film and music industry. But in the end it was more in the vein of fast food than a meal at one of the chic restaurants that the characters of this book would want to be seen at."
2,What a disappointment!,"I'm with the minority in this review group -- the anticipation of this book was much greater than the satisfaction in the delivery. I have been a big Elmore Leonard fan for a long time, but this one fell flat for me. I couldn't raise much of an interest in any of the secondary characters, and somehow the story seemed to draaaaaaaaaaaaag and draaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaag and draaaaaaaaaaaaaag from time to time. Nobody can bat .400 every time -- I'm looking forward to Elmore Leonard's next one."
2,Pretty Flat...,"This, the sequel to ""Get Shorty,"" takes Chili Palmer from the world of film to the music industry. Although one of the book's themes is a very self-conscious attempt to comment on the nature of sequels, it falls pretty flat since it's just not that good. The behind the scenes music stuff comes off as very cliché and dated, and just doesn't work very well. There is the usual cast of wacky Leonard characters, some more entertaining than others--but as I feel about other of his books, wackiness alone doesn't cut it."
1,Apt material for a high school english class!,"I was amused by a previous review stating that a high school student had read ""Be Cool"" as an English assignment. That's great if your teaching a novel with zero character development, zero story, hell, practically no plot. And I've enjoyed some of Leonard's other books. And the most embarassing part is Leonard's take on present day rock 'n roll. I can see him desperately picking the brains of people he thinks might be ""hep"" to the current scene. He breaks the first rule of writing; write what you know about. This book was a mess. Were the blurb folks paid off?"
3,"It's cool alright, just not a classic","Leonard never really writes sequels, he just writes books with the same characters in occasionally. A prime example is The Switch and Rum Punch, with some fantastic characterisation and clever plots. For Be Cool, the characters are there, but the plot isn't quite so finely-tuned. It's as if Leonard wanted to use Chili Palmer again, so just stuck him in the music business this time. But no matter what plot there is, the dialogue always sparkles, and this book is no exception, all wrapped up in some very funny set-pieces. It's still as bizarre as ever, with baseball-bat wielding Samoans and rug-wearing Russians, the eccentricity that really sets Leonard apart from all the rest. Be Cool is as cool as ever, if not quite classic Leonard."
4,"Fast, Sharp and funny.","As always Leonard's book is as enjoyable for it's dialogue as it is for the bizarre, quirky story."
3,Decent rainy Saturday afternoon material,"I decided to read Leonard Elmore solely because I new about the movie ""Get Shorty"", which was adapted from one of his other novels, and I foolishly assumed that any book made into a movie must be pretty good. This particular book reads quickly and crassly. It seems as though Elmore makes up for his lack of creative vocabulary with plenty of creative four letter words. Also, the characters are arrogant, a quality I assume draws readers. The genre is difficult to target...not a true mystery, comedy or drama. Nonetheless, it is fast paced, non-stop action, in other words, good reading for a rainy Saturday afternoon."
4,Leonard's novels ore page turners like no else,"Elmore Leonard makes me turn pages faster than anything I've read. I am a fan of Hunter Thompson, Kurt Vonnegut, Charles Bukowski, WS Burroughs so Leonard lacks one thing FOR ME: substance. His books are PURE entertainment. And there is nothing wrong with that. I read his books in two or three nights. I DEVOUR them. Characters are great, story is unique and thrilling, and dialogue is crisp, like no other ever! He is the king of the crime novel. But don't look for any theme or motif really,because there isn't one. EL never pretended to have this though, he is just a great writer. Just light reading for me and extremely entertaining."
2,Where Is the Plot?,"If there is a plot to this book, I missed it. Leonard put in gansta rappers, an up & coming female vocalist, a part-Samoan, a movie producer, Russian gangsters. and a friendly cop. There was murder, brutal murder, sex and music. He shook them all up and poured them out on paper. And it just didn't work."
1,boring,"ten years ago I was forced to watch this with a friend for her film class. I thought this was the biggest waist of two hours (don't worry it feels more like four).So when this same friend's brother asked if I wanted to see it I said sure, I've grown and matured... unfortunatly this film has not.This is one of those rare movies that many cinephiles have written and heard about, but is pure mysogynistic drivel, barely having a plot or any shred of talent as far as acting. I've read how it is influencial and all, but this movie is just downright boring and mysogynistic and confusing.If you are interested in the whole London Mod scene see either Absolute Beginners, Quadraphenia or any Austin Powers movie. Otherwise move on to the new century please."
3,Beautiful and Dated,"""Blow-Up"" is a perfect example of a serious work that belongs exclusively to the time in which it was created. The setup is wonderful -- a murder that seems to be, seems not to be, and probably actually is, on film. And the idea of bringing the detached photographer -- who distances himself from life by staying on his side of the viewfinder -- into real engagement with other people, is also pretty swell. But in the end it's all in service of a very dated 60s nihilism that makes the film seem to turn yellow and curl at the edges in spite of a splendid performance by David Hemmings and some exquisite photography. When the film is over it seems naive, and the supposedly daring view of nothingness it puts forth seems as shallow and trendy as a bad period hairdo or garishly outdated clothes."
3,"Well, you'll love it or you'll hate it","You'll hate it if you like Hollywood movies. You'll love it if you recognize it as the human condition expressed using visuals only--a revolutionary idea when Antonioni first tried it. He selected every object in every scene for its symbolic meaning, even though the movie's theme is that meaning is impossible to know. But his hero tries to create meaning anyway, since he lives in an age where Existentialism, Marshall McCluhan, and the beginning of mass electronic media are eroding meaning. It's ""art for the artist's sake""--fascinating if you're on the artist's wavelength, boring if you're not; but important for its historic significance to film-making."
4,Watch it a few times to get the effect.,"At first, I thought it was the worst movie I've ever scene. But upon second glance, this movie grew on me. Every time I watch this film, I pick out different aspects about the film. This is not a typical movie. There's hardly any dialogue and the music is not abundant. Too many movies in Hollywood has flash. This is a thinking person's movie. It gives the person the chance to figure it out for themselves."
1,Very painful,"Wow....I don't know what to say. I read about this moving in a photography magazine as I am an amateur photographer so I thought I would check it out. After seeing 4 star ratings at Amazon and reading good reviews I purchased the video.The movie was quickly boring but I kept waiting for something to happen, it had to since it was rated pretty good. I next found myself wanting to just turn it off and do something useful but again since the rating was good I had to continue to see the end.If you want to watch a guy run around just taking pictures all of the time then this is for you. This had to have been the worst 2 hours and $15 I have ever spent in my life......do not buy or watch this movie."
4,President of Alligator Records Reviews Duo Personality,"Bruce Iglauer wrote:""Thanks for the Duo Personality CD.Some very restrained and tasteful playing here.I didn't know your harp vocabulary was so wide and your sense of melody so rich.A nice surprise.I also enjoyed the guitar playing and the overall low key feel of the album.A good listen with moments of excellent harp.""

3,Rainy Day Golf Games,"We were looking for more physical type games in case we had to be inside. These are all paper games, etc.--but very good if that's what you are looking for."
5,"Getting a dog, get this book first","Actually this is a great book to have if you plan on getting a dog or you already own a dog. Easy to read and understand. It covers everything from A-Z on caring for your dog from a young puppy to the senior citizen. I will recommend this book to all my puppy, basic and advance students."
1,"Poorly written, unhelpful","This is a very disappointing book. Almost anyone with dog experience and an 8th grade education could do a better job. The author states in his foreword that he makes no apologies for spelling or grammar mistakes. No excuse! There are errors of punctuation, grammar, and spelling throughout. This might be excusable if the information were of any help, but it's not. About 80% of the information is self-evident, 19% is speculative personal opinion, and only 1% is anything I was unaware of (and I'm not exactly a dog expert). The number of pages is misleading, as there are many blank pages or pages with almost no text, silly cartoons, or big type. The material could fit into about 20 pages of double-spaced text.Don't waste your money on this book! I recommend Charlene Bell's book instead."
3,more Colorado than Martha's Vineyard,"This mystery brings the brother of a dead college girl out of his Army special forces unit, on a mission to avenge his sister's wrongful death. Somehow, our hero J. W. Jackson gets caught in the crossfire, and must stop this man from killing his friend, a college professor. The book also features a side story that at first you think may be the main story, but which disappears until the very end of the book.I considered this a sub-par Martha's Vineyard book. Better to stay on the island, Mr Craig."
2,ukkk!,It's so bad that its not even funny. It takes everything from the first movie and destroys it. The only good thing is it led to the series. The rest of the sequal don't even mention this alien thing. and thats good. Personally I'd rather believe in immortal humans then strange aliens in a plot that doesn't even make sense.
3,We need the sun to live!,"The theme of the first film is back with two twists. First the extraterrestrial origin of the immortals who were thrown on earth to fight to the finish. Second the highly profitable, for some, invention of a solar screen for the earth that creates a mess in twenty-five years, a mess that has to be corrected by removing the shield, an action that the private corporation that installed it refuses. The action is just the same as in the first film : fencing and beheadings. The ecological stake is interesting and looks like a denunciation of private concerns when we are confronted with the future of the earth, a future that should always be controled by the people, and not by private interests or by super-heroes. Rather disappointing. Dr Jacques COULARDEAU, paris Universities II and IX"
1,The ultimate insult...,"A double-disc special edition of one of the worst movies of all time? Give me a break, for pity's sake!!! The only double-disc special edition that would fit is a double MST3K."
3,Highlander Flop?,"Hmmm..... Where to begin. The special effects are great, but as a major Highlander fan, I don't see where this one fits in. Great for boredom or to collect for your Highlander Collection. Even after they took out the PLanet Zeist stuff, it still didn't really help much, but at least they did a better job with the Renegade Version. The stills even are screwy, if you ever try to look at them the screen just flashes them all by, not good for Highlander standards, I like to look the special features over at a leisurely pace, not go into a seizure.BB-T"
1,Worst major film ever?,"Probably the worst film ever made,outside of low budget trash films.From the awful script,lousy acting,ridiculous plot,all the way to the Sean 'just give me my check and I'm outa here' Connery cameo,this movie absolutely reeks of a thrown together corpse looking for a payday.Absolute waste of time--I saw it at a second run theater with a friend (against my better judgement),and I would have left in the first half hour,if my friend wasn't also my ride.It's especially a travesty since they doubtless counted on suckering in fans of the first film,which was entertaining in a campy way.This movie was entirely a cynical business transaction.Zero stars."
1,Worst. Movie. Ever.,"I can't really say much more than ""This is the worst movie ever conceived by the mind of man."" I've never been so amazed at such a pathetic plot, horrid FX, weak acting, contrived fighting scenes, and so on. I guess this could have some redeeming value if an aspiring director/screenwriter watched it as an example of what not to do. There IS one way to make the movie perfect, however: add in the Mystery Science 3000 guys. They'd have a field day! (And BTW, this is a review of the ""Renegade"" version. If this is better, I fel sorry for the poor sap who saw ""The Quickening"" version :P )"
1,A review of the Bluray version of the film,"I'm not going to comment on how good or bad the movie was. By now everyone remotely interested in seeing this has already seen it and formed their own opinion. I'm going to review the video quality of this film briefly: it sucks! The video transfer has some decent blacks but it otherwise is just awful. There is ringing, haloing, and uneven video quality even within the film itself! Aliasing is almost constant (the jaggies) and there is lots of video noise throughout. The audio is actually pretty decent, but seriously if you DO like this film and want to own it, try getting the DVD version instead, or at least RENT the Bluray before buying. Seriously, it's releases like these that make me always want to read reviews before buying!"
1,Shame! Shame! Lame!,"You can read the other reviews and tell what kind of film this is. I saw this film nine years ago when it was first released. I didn't know how the film makers could improve on the original story, after all ""there can be only one,"" and I thought that after the first film there was only one. Anyway, after watching the film and leaving the theater the phrase that was on my mind and being spoken by the other viewers was ""What the hell?!?"" Nine years later my sentiments are still the same."
2,Makes no sense as a sequel,"I loved the original Highlander movie and even the series with Adrian Paul that spun off from it. This was an interesting movie (ozone factor probably the best part) but it made absolutely no sense in the Highlander whole saga. The origins of the immortals didn't make sense at all, and I was disappointed. I don't understand why they made this movie that didn't fit with the original movie, the series, or with the third movie."
2,Highlander - the flop,"Not a favorite 'Highlander' of mine. It lacked credibility. The fantasy of immortality was lost. Why? I'm thankful for ""Highlander"" and ""Highlander - End Game""."
1,Unbelievably bad!,"Before I watched Highlander II, a friend of mine warned me away: He said that watching it is like finding out John Wayne was a cross-dresser. He was right--this shameful sequel takes what was a beautiful and fascinating story (the original), and inexplicable ruins it in the most bizarre way to generate one of the worst, most truly unwatchable movies in history.Among its many sins, it utterly ignores the wonderful story line of the original--the very heart and soul of the Highlander saga--and instead we're left with an idiotic revisionist plot, the immortals being a bunch of aliens who all came to earth at the same time after being banished from some other planet. Forget all the ""history"" from the first movie, none of it applies.Lambert and Connery should be ashamed of themselves for having anything to do with this dreadful garbage. END"
1,Yuck!,This movie is a joke! I heard the bad reviews but I never thought the movie could be that bad. The first was one of my favorite movies ever. Only the true die-hard fans should even consider watching this hope-crushing sequel. I just ordered no.3 and I am anxious to see how that one turned out.
1,"Bad, Bad, Bad","Bad. That's it. I saw this movie when released in the theatres....I was excited that there was a sequal. But, was totally confused and disappointed when walking out. I had never seen such a piece of .... This is unbelieveably bad. I even bought the renegade DVD version to, hopefully, get some sense out of it. The only good thing on the DVD is the excuses by the director for how bad the movie was. BAD."
5,Worderful,"A real book for real engineers. Today, most engineers rely on expensive software and forget some of the basics of engineering. This book is like a return to the roots of engineering."
1,Break the habit. Save $400+,"Almost everything you would ever want to do with MS Office can be done with other tools (like Open Office) which are FREE or cost substantially less.I've been a Mac user since the very first Mac came out (1984). I avoid most Microsoft products because they have become bloated, slow and difficult to use.Want to waste your money by buying this, then waste your time trying to navigate the counter-intuitive functionality? - Go ahead. But don't say you weren't warned!"
1,Bad Beyond Belief,"Don't even think about buying this movie. Awarded 1 star only because ZERO was not given as an option. I received it as a gift ( a GAG gift, as it turns out...) so I felt obligated to watch at least some of it. Bad acting, terrible script, non-existant special effects and a cheesey music score. The only thing worse than the movie itself is the DVD transfer, which features a bleached out, grainy print and miserable sound to go with it. You can't do any worse than this. Spend your [money] on beer or cigarettes."
3,Typical Roger Corman flick,"If you are a fan of Roger Corman, it is fun to watch for his mark (low budget, unknown cast members, sparse sets) on a film."
1,Disappointed,I was very disappointed in the quality of the Scrabble board. The tiles will not stay in place on the board. The letters slide all around. This was why I purchased the Deluxe Scrabble Game. It is not like the older deluxe versions when the tiles do not move when put on the board. I would not recommend this to anyone who wants a Deluxe version.
1,This game sucks!,"I played this game once and the minute i put the first letter piece down i thought to myself am i dreaming or is this the worst game I ever played. I mean really who can have fun spelling for 3 hours straight. If you want to play a better game i suggest Battleship or risk those are at least better then boring old scrabble. The only reason i could see someone buying this game is for firewood. Sometimes people say ""Oh it's a classic and everyone loves a classic game"" Well guess what classic smassic I say out with the old on with the new. Well all in all if you are really trying to become a nerd a suggest scrabble DELUX edition.Your friendThe Z-MAN"
2,LAME!,"This game is boring.All you do is spell words by using your letters to connect to a word that is already made.It gets kinda boring after a couple of games.You should buy Up Words,at least you can stack letters in that game."
5,The greatest word game of them all. . .,". . .in an extremely convenient and durable format.No more wrecking the game because someone accidentally (or deliberately) shoved their chair into the table! In this beautiful edition of this classic game, letters stay in place. The swivel feature, allowing all players to see the game ""right-side up"" is also an added benefit.Yes, there will still be arguments over the validity of words (save yourself -- get the Scrabble Dictionary), there will still be frustrations when someone takes the ""triple-word score"" that you had the PERFECT word for (after all, how many letters have both 'z' and 'j' in them!), etc. BUT the inconveniences of the standard edition have been cleverly eliminated.A great game and a great value."
1,Deluxe Scrabble Board,"I found the playing surface on the deluxe Scrabble board to be flimsy and uneven. The raised ridges, which are meant to hold the tiles in place, allow the tiles to slide out of position during play. The company needs to recreate the high-quality boards with turntables from several decades ago. They are still for sale on EBay, if you can get one."
2,"Deluxe? Yeah, right.","This is a horrible, shoddy construction for something that used to be done so well. The grooves that are intended to hold the tiles in place as the whiz around on the lazy susan aren't tall enough to hold the tiles in place on even a gentle spin, thereby rendering the whole thing pointless. I can't imagine why they would have changed the construction of the board besides saving a few pennies. Clearly they never tested it on actual people before putting it in stores."
4,Any Scrabble Will Do,"If you like Scrabble and need a Scrabble game, any set will do. This board is very nice, does not fold. The tiles fit into the board, not like other boards. However, the box is much larger and a regular set is better for storage.The game is highly educational and teaches uncommon words of the English language. It is excellent for building vocabulary skills and spelling. Of all word games, I recommend this one. Also try the CD-ROM Scrabble for avid computer users.This particular game set is for people who enjoy Scrabble and would like a fancy collector's edition."
2,the only thing deluxe is the price,this product is exteremely pricey i expected the premiere edition for this priceinstead i got a plastic turntable and a product probably worth $40-50.00 save your money!!!!! i could not enjoy the game because it is so overpriced.
4,Scrabble Lover,I bought this Scrabble game after starting to play the game again. I used to play this when I was younger and thought it was fun back then. Now I know more words and it is more enjoyable than ever. When I discovered that there was a Scrabble game on a turntable there was no hesitation. It is easier to play the game when you can look at the right side of the board and not up side down. Amazon.com was a great place to purchase this Scrabble game. I went online and ordered. I wasn' even charged shipping. It came to my house in Alaska in record time. Amazon.com is great.
3,Cheap and Shallow?,"I was disappointed in the quality of the plastic board for the cost of $48.00. The ridges to keep the tiles in place seem too shallow, as tiles come out rather easily. Scrabble itself is a wonderful game!"
1,Don't understand why they made this,"I don't understand why this was released as a ""deluxe"" edition. This board is horrible. It is made of cheap plastic, nothing like you would think for $30. I was very, very, very disappointed in this. If you are looking for a good scrabble board, look somewhere else, because this is not the one. I have an old one that is great, but it is dirty and old, so i wanted somthing new. I am sorry I bought this. I guess it could be good as an occasional toy, but not for serious scrabble lovers."
2,Not very durable,"Scrabble is a terrific game-I am a college professor, and bought this version of the game to entertain some other professors at my house one evening. I love the turntable, but was very, very disappointed to find that the board itself is made of paper-not plastic like ones I have seen. Well, this board won't last very long. All someone has to do is spill a drink on the board, and it's bye-bye $30.00! Be sure that you store this game in a cool, dry place.If you expect that this Scrabble version won't last very long, you won't be disappointed."
2,Poor Quality for the Price,"I bought this game after my wife and I started playing Scrabble frequently. I thought that the rotating board would be more convenient than using our lazy susan. I also thought the raised grid would be great for keeping the tiles in place. However, for the price I paid, I expected much better quality. Upon opening the box, I immediately commented how cheap the plastic was. As I set the board down, the playing surface was very thin and wasn't really attached completely to the base. It was very thin cardboard and moved up and down when you touched it. On the box, it appears that the tile holders have the information about the number of letter tiles molded into them. But, they are just stickers. I packed it all up and returned it the same day. If I had paid a lot less, I would've kept it. But, it was just too poor quality for what I paid."
4,It was what we were expecting,Is a good product and it gives you exactly what they offer and what you can find in reviews. But of course it is just a shadow in comparison with the old scrabbles that were made with a more strong plastic and had this metal pins to register the scores. SOME ONE SHOULD RETAKE THAT.
2,Cheap Board,"I enjoyed this new deluxe board because of its ability to rotate. However, I took it to a friend's house and left it in the car for about 2 hours the result was not pretty. The cheap overlay that forms the surface that you play on melted and warped. Despite attempts to reshape it I had to trash the whole set. For fifty dollars I think the manufacter could have made a product that stood up to 80 degree day."
2,Disappointing Board,"I read the reviews and decided to try it anyway. The grids do not hold the letters. They slide around just like on the regular folding board. I love this game, but the board is horrible for the price. I promptly returned it. Will hold out for a better turntable board."
5,turntable Scrabble board,"This product is MUCH more convenient to play than the original Scrabble as you don't have to read upside down! It is very durable and user friendly. We began using it as soon as it arrived. Now my friends want one as well, especially the one who told me about it in the first place! We can expand our vocabularies while having lots of fun. It is also humbling because often I don't win! I would recommend it to people of all ages."
3,Okay...But Not Great.,"Anything ""Forgotten Realms"" that R.A. Salavore writes, I read. Were this not the case, I might well never have bought, let alone read, this particular book. It has in focus the ""bad guys"" of Salvatore's AD&D storyline, but lacks a certain charm. It is hard to wish the characters well and thus be drawn into their story, and when one of the secondary characters that had been relatively important is suddenly and swiftly dead, one can hardly mourn. It is treated in the text pretty much as a next-to-irrelevant fact.If you are a die-hard Salvatore fan, you'll want to read this book to keep up with the overall storyline and know what happens with the Crystal Shard. If you're not a part of this ""elite"" band, then don't bother."
1,"Lying Sophistry, Defective Casuistry, Same'ol Failed Apologetics","A stereotypical volume featuring the same hysterics, lyin' sophistry, insincerity, defective casuistry and mind bogglin' ignorance that characterizes the religious phenomena encompassed by the term fundamentalism. First rate evangelicrap!"
4,Piano with vocal,I like it. Give me more relax when coming home from work. The sound is clear and nice. It OK to me.
1,Awful,"I wish I had trusted the other reviews written on this thing. Awful product. Tried to use it on my stairs and it's impossible, the attachments that came with my old Bissel vac worked so much better. Really a disappointment. Brush isn't strong enough, it's a weird angle which makes it really difficult to use on the stairs, etc. I'm really annoyed that I purchased this product. Don't buy it."
2,Dyson disappointment,"I got this item to control pet hair as I have 2 dogs that shed. It is ok, but not the performance I expected from dyson. I love my vaccuum cleaner and figured this would be just as awesome. Worth using, but not at the nearly 80.00 price tag. If you can get a used one for half this price- then maybe."
4,Works pretty well,"I have an older yellow dyson (dc07) and connected this attachment to the hose. Suction is not as great as using the hose by itself, but worked pretty well on the stairs and bedspreads where I wanted to get out dog hair from our chocolate lab. Takes a bit of time but it got the job done and with a lot less strain on my back! dont forget to wipe off the filter so the airflow remains strong."
4,"Good job, but pricey","Works pretty well. Have long haired cats and this did a decent job getting most of the fur off of furniture. Didn't get everything, thus not a 5 star rating. Also, really expensive for what it does...."
5,"excellent, plus wheat and gluten free",A very tasty combination of ingredients. Plus if you are looking for a wheat/gluten free snack...these are a great choice.
2,"Well made, just didn't like the texture.","Solid with whole nuts and fruits. Just didn't expect it to be sticky. Liked the taste, but didn't care for the texture or the stickiness."
3,It's cheap and worth buying.,"What we have is a game worth buying. It has good graphics, the futuristic vs medieval vs monsters works, and watching armies clashing on the battlefield is a great site to see. Let me tell you though, there is little or no support , nobody plays online, no storyline, and the campaign missions are the same. Although this game is pretty much dead, it's worth the $."
3,less than great,"Some good musical ideas here, slickly performed. The effect is marred by numbing repetition. With the exception of ""Jim I Nim"", the music is far removed from its source material, some of the tracks sounding phony and commercial. If you hate heavy breathing in your music, this is not the album for you."
3,Fun but frustrating,"If you know spanish, and love scrabble, then this is the game for you. If you are learning spanish, then I would recommend that you steer cleer. In my opinion, there aren't enough vowels, and too often I get the K, W, and X tiles. I have a friend from Panama who tells me that he finds the English version easier than the Spanish! Anyway, it is fun, but you must have a good working vocabulary, or a thorough knowledge of verb conjugation, in order to do well."
2,Too old - LL and RR are separate letters!,"The game comes with ""LL"" and ""RR"" as if it would be one letter. That's too old. In modern spanish, LL are two Ls and RR are two Rs."
5,Brand name dryer outlet,"Not much to say about a dryer receptacle. This one is a Leviton, which is a well-known brand. The price was great and delivery was super fast."
1,The Fiber for LIfe Cook Book,"I was looking for a high fiber cook book but found out after receiving it that it is a vegan cook book. Soy milk, egg substitute and other vegan ingredients are common."
1,European sized Swimsuit,"Suit was too small, not enough information available on the site for it and I would not buy another bathing suit from Amazon as it cost me money to send it back."
3,I don't like titles,"this game is a lot of fun for all ages... I just don't think that 5 dice, a plastic cup, and a special Yahtzee pad of paper should cost $7.99"
2,A Game of Luck,"This game is just not fun. Too much of it depends on luck, even if there is some strategy. If you want a fun board game, get something else, this game is just boring."
5,Easy to Play but a Challange to Win!,This is an oldie but goodie. I had this game from childhood but in a flood I lost it. Year's later thinking about all the fun I had with it I bought it again. I'm glad I did. It's just as fun as it ever was and even more so now that I don't get upset if I don't always win. The cat also likes the Dice. It's an inexpensive game fun for the whole family that will bring back happy memories and make new ones.
5,Excellent,"This is one of my favourite games and makes a great solitaire game.It can get frustrating at some times.Most of the skill lies in the scoring but there are alot of times where you have to make sacrifices.I recommend you get the folio travle version thing, because it is so much more attractive, great for travelling and doesn't create that much noise.It is also makes a great solitaire game."
3,Not bad,"The New Breed are members of the Tunnel Rats crew. Personally I've never been a huge fan of their recorded stuff, but they put up some pretty awesome live shows =]This album was hit-and-miss, with a few tracks that are excellent, and a few that are awful. I think they over-do double voices, but I've never liked that style much myself. They mix in a little Latin flavor very effectively. For fans of the underground Christian rap movement, there is a good chance you will like what you hear."
5,"Track-for-track, Zeppelin's best!..............","Everybody has their personal favorite Zep album.........and while my first choice would still probably be Vol. IV (it's awfully hard to do without ""Stairway To Heaven""), I do believe that ""Houses Of The Holy"" is their strongest work from start to finish. ""The Song Remains The Same"", ""Over The Hills And Far Away"", ""Dancin Days"", ""D'yer Mak'r"" & ""The Ocean"" are classics. ""No Quarter"" is a haunting track that showcases some great keyboard work from John Paul Jones. And I love ""The Crunge""-----a funky derivative of an old James Brown tune. There are ""heavier"" albums (Vol. I & ""Physical Graffiti""), and those with more commercial appeal (Vol. II, Vol. IV), but I think ""Houses Of The Holy"" is musically the best. Buy it!!"
4,Led Zeppelin 101,"If you're looking to get started with this band with a studio record rather than one of the greatest hits albums, this isn't a bad place to go. This album works out to showcase a little of everything from Zeppelin, with epics like ""The Rain Song"" and ""No Quarter,"" guitar attacks ""The Song Remains The Same"" and ""Dancing Days,"" and EASILY one of their 10 best songs ever, ""Over The Hills And Far Away."" Highly recommended to fans and newcomers alike."
2,Lead Balloon?,"This stuff is like played on all the classic rock stations. Some kids like it but some dislike it not just because its so old and sounds it, but because their parents love it. Theres also a rumour at my school, that when the drummer was too drunk or drugged, which was lots of the time, he used a drum machine. Also some kids say they heard Robert Plant used to be a woman and thats why he sounds weird sometimes."
1,This Is Not Metal Or Even Rock,"Hearing that Led Zeppelin was a heavy metal band,(and I am a huge metal fan), I decided to buy this album since I had heard it was pretty good.Well it stinks.Not anywhere on this lousy album is not even the slightest hint of metal. Actually The Beatles get heavier than this. Dy'er Maker is so un-heavy it should be included with Frank Sinatra. Only if you are a pop fan should you buy this album, so metalheads and headbangers, STAY AWAY!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!"
5,awsome,This is as simple as it gets i dub thee the best cd ever i have heard there others but man does houses of the holy kick as*. i bought this cd a couple of weeks ago and usually my other cd's get tireing and i move on but hell man this is awsome i'm still listening to it today. if i was you i would get up and buy this right now it Rocks. the music on this cd makes you want to flow with it you get right into this cd.
5,One of those must haves for any true music fan...,"Houses of the Holy didn't start Led Zeppelin's fascination with Tolkien-like imagry, but it sure had been perfected by the release of this wonderful album. From the beginning to the end, it plays like a sunset streaking across the sky. Rocking songs mix with slower ballads and make a work of art that is as close to perfection that music can be. While 'Houses' may not contain as many singles as Led Zeppelin IV it makes up for it in it's long, sweeping epics and poetic, mystical lyrics. A classic in every sense of the word; a must own for any true rock fan."
4,Beautiful dreamy pop,This is how The Cranberries always tried to sound but never made it. It's a kind if meeting between by The Smiths and Cocteau Twins.
4,Wonderful cookbook,The cookbook has some great recipes in it. The book was used a little tattered but useful just the same.
1,Hunter S. Thompson is an a$$hole.,"This guy is a self-inflating ballon. No one and nothing is as important in his eyes as he is. His opinion of himself and the world around him is all that really matters. His ability to cunningly insinuate himself into the minds of others dramatically increases the danger he poses. If you have the misfortune to be assigned one of his books in a college class, lament that no one has made ""Cliff Notes."""
4,The beginning,"By no means the best book HST wrote... Still, it's essential reading for any fan as it was written by a younger, more serious and lucid Hunter Thompson - not the hilarious-dope-fiend-life-on-the-edge Thompson that we all grew to love."
3,OK,"Hunter S. Thompson bravely partied with the notorious gang for some time, presumably in an effort to humanize, demystify and, I guess, understand this bunch. He finds the humanity but also is witness to the raw, booze-fueled aggression so inherent in an organization of self-described outlaws. The vignettes satisfy, but the book has a sarcastic, braggadocios edge to it that distracts. He adopts a nauseating You-Had-To-Be-There voice early on that cheats the book of authenticity. A bright point was that Thompson is ultimately circumspect about his experience with the bikers, tossing off a well-reasoned psychological profile of his subjects' outcast leanings."
1,"I like Hunter, but come on!","I cannot believe all of the positive hype about this book. This is the least effective of Hunter Thompson's books. We are treated to the same thing over and over again: bikers tearing through the streets, spreading mayhem everywhere they go. Nothing personal, Hunter, but why'd the heck you write this stinker?"
4,He tells it like it was,"Hunter Thompson trys to get the facts about the ""outlaw's"" by being there with a group of them. He was upfront and got beyond the hype put out by ""the man"" and dealt with bikers as real people. This book speaks of a time before the ""R.I.C.O."" statutes turned loose ""agents-provocateur"" to entice individual gang members to break the law. Thompson's accurate descriptions of his time within the biker community are now historical documents speaking of a past 30 years gone. In his time Outlaws were still creating the biker lifestyle, free from the image consciousness of today's bikers. [$20G's&20 miles don't make you a biker!] They ride what they want and do things that make for good storytelling on Thompson's part.I recommend this book as a balance to the disinformation found in most others on the subject, and because it's entertaining reading."
3,"Interesting ideas and resources, but not detailed enough","While the book provides a wealth of information and numerous valuable sources of information, the author is biased to mid-sized apartment buildings. Despite his recommendations to hire top notch professional ""consultants"" to save time and limit problems, readers should be prepared to perform the necessary due dilegence required to find and monitor good consultants (requires your time and $), and to research and understand the conditions of each real estate market in detail. I benefited from the points set forth in the book overall, but compared to other ""how to"" books I've read, this one lacks the depth that I expected given its title."
1,Not what's made out to be....,"This book talks about buying and selling apartment buildings, in fact it discusses the ownership of these buildings in such detail that it is easy to forget that all of the discussion is based on theoretical buys and sells. Never is a purchase or sale actually accomplished or discussed. This book also recommends readers to consult with a ""real estate education"" organization the author also happens to head, and to use the software developed by this organization."
2,too basic information not current,"This book is good for buying apartment buildings in the 1980's but his only approach for profiting is when you sell them not on the actual rent roll! I found book to be interesting about the basics, but not for today's market and not for making real money."
2,Guess I Picked a Bad Week to Buy the Blu-ray,"The Blu-ray release of ""Airplane"" is a disgrace! American Film Institute calls the film one of the funniest films of all time, and it is. But the video transfer would be poor even by first generation VHS standards. Faded color, excessive grain, film scratches are evident throughout this Blu-ray release. Blu-ray releases of old titles of less stature than ""Airplane"" are released all the time in Hi-def. This transfer is not Hi-def, but purely a release on a Blu-ray disc. Shame on you, Paramount. This classic deserves a worthy release now!"
3,In it for Long Haul...but where is it?,"This is one of my favorite movies of all time and I anxiously bought it, inserested it in my new Samsung high-def capable DVD player. and clicked on long haul edition..and yes, I wanted to see deleted scenes and interviews. but, after trying several times, all I kept getting was the short version. Surely I'm missing something. I obviously am, or I wouldn't call myself Shirley. Feel free to comment."
1,This edition is contaminated with crap advertising,"Airplane is one of the funniest movies of all time -- as I remember it.Unfortunately, this DVD didn't help me remember why. I put it in my player, and was subjected to SEVEN MINUTES OF LOUD, CRASS, OBNOXIOUS, and TOTALLY IRRELEVANT ADVERTISING.Back into the box it was put, and back to Amazon it went. Shame on you, Paramount. If you want to develop a decent customer base, then don't treat us with such contempt.Amazon was very gracious about taking it back -- but you're much better off if you don't get it in the first place. There must be some other edition that's cleaner and less commercially obstreperous.Grumble."
4,Airplane -still crazy after all these years,"If you are feeling the burdens of life, if the boss, the blues, and the bills gotcha down - escape for awhile, kick back, and allow your sense of the ridiculous to come out. Put in this copy of Airplane in your DVD player and allow the kid in you to laugh at the absurdly ridiculous. You'll feel better after you did. No, this isn't art, it isn't fine cinema, but it doesn't pretend to be. It is what it is-adolescent humor and escapist entertainment. Sure, it was made awhile ago, and some of the cultural icon jokes may whiz past some younger viewers, but it still has enough comedy to catch all ages. No pompous stiff-shirted film maven would like this, but who cares? Laugh it up!"
5,Clasic!!,"Still love this movie. So, funny no matter how many times I watch it. Leslie Nelson is still the funnyest EVER!! He is missed. But lives on in this classic. :)"
5,A Different Kind of Quality,"Most people who've seen this movie believe that it's one of the best laugh riots ever created. In many cases, THE best. On the other hand, there's a sizable minority who think this movie is a deplorable waste of time.I lean towards the laugh riot side. Airplane, simply put, is the best parody ever made. Yes, the jokes are stupid, but not stupid enough to be unfunny. Leave it to Beaver's mom, the airplane prop sound, the blow-up pilot...there's a lot of classic moments. Lighten up, take this movie for what it is!Also, the ""no acting"" argument is somewhat frivilous. You can't say that a parody movie has no acting, because parodies (by nature) do not exploit the talents of actors. I'd go as far as to say that acting is completely beside the point. Also, what about Leslie Nielsen? His amazing straight-laced demeanor was the springboard for his second career.If you can't take a joke, save your cash. For everyone else, Airplane! is an amusing waste of time."
4,One of the 10 greatest comedies of all time! (My opinion),"If I were to describe a movie that contains allusions to pedofilia, bestiality, racial stereotypes, mental illness and drug abuse, you would either have me arrested, committed or you would smile with a knowing grin and remember the first time you saw Airplane!The movie succeeds in its rapid-fire delivery of humor. Some dont always land, but right behind it is one that does. I just watched it again after a few years and, although it did not have quite the same impact it had when I was younger, I still had a smile throughout the whole movie.I still use several lines from the movie in my everyday life, such as ""Looks like I picked the wrong week to quit sniffing glue,"" and of course ""Dont call me Shirley."" Then there is ""You like movies about gladiators,"" but thats not important right now.Kareem Abdul-Jabbar as a co-pilot is a cinematic triumph!I love this movie."
3,airplane movie,This movie contains a lot of sexual implications and suggestions and one brief flash of nudity. It should be an R movie. It is funny but inappropriately rated.
1,Say No to Triple-Dip Rereleases,"This is sheer baloney! Here is one of several DVD's releases YET AGAIN with a few more extra bits thrown in. Write to the companies putting these movies out in re-released form, and tell them you want to BOYCOTT this behavior. The only release that ever did the RIGHT THING as far as I know was Pulp Fiction and Reservoir Dogs, where you were sent a rebate off the purchase price if you had older versions of the movie, and upgraded. And these movie companies have the gall to run anti-piracy ads before their movies? PLEASE! The consumer is playing fair, so why can't movie companies play fair. If you're fed up like I am over this behavior, SPEAK UP! Say No to Triple-Dip Rereleases..."
4,No high end pc? No problem,"This game i great if you find yourself stuck in some place that you don't want to be at and have a laptop that isn't very high end spec to play games. First of all you can have a hero that you play through skirmish battles and campaign that grow with each battle. Next is all the different races there are. Mix with quests and other abilities you can choose a few pretty cool ways to play: make your hero a one man army, a powerful magic user, a charismatic commander, a crafty merchant, etc...Okay heres the bad part. Graphics aren't very top notch at all. Game play might get a little boring, but of course this game is only for those temporary occasions.All in all, its a game that will run on a lot of systems, easy on the wallet, and fairly enjoyable."
2,No storyline,"I just picked up this game, got it with Warlords 4 for free. After installing it, I realized why it came free - the game sucks! It seems to be an improved version of WBC1, but they left one thing out - a story. In WBC2, The goal of the game is to take over the world. That's it. You're shown a map, and asked which territory you want to take over. No real purpose to it, except mindless slaughter. I'm sure glad I didn't waste 40 bucks on money on this game. If you live for multiplayer, this might be a good choice, but for those of us that would rather play a single player game, don't waste your money."
1,Original Packaging Was Better..,"I was so excited to play the game, until I found out you couldn't stack it with the piece of paper. Then if you try to put it away, all the blocks fall over and there is no where to stuff the piece of paper they give you for a stacker. I sent mine back to Hasbro (on them) and asked for the old version. They refunded my money. I hope this inspires them to go back to the original."
3,it's the travel version,"This is a great game to grab and go. The handle is easy to pick up and the box sturdy to throw in the back of the car. If looking for a fun portable game, this is the way to go.However, this is a cheaper version of the game, and it shows when you go to reset a stack. Instead of a plastic holder that lines up the pieces for the next round, it just has a thin cardboard sleeve that only covers two sides of a stack. Also, this is quite subjective, but to me the wooden pieces themselves just feel a little cheaper/lighter than other versions I have played."
3,"Good reference, but not a good teaching book","This book is a good reference for the Discrete Cosine Transform. The mathematics is only moderately difficult, and should provide little difficulty for a talented engineer graduate, say.And yet I can't give this book a great review. It's all rather clinical, with little attempt to provide overview or insight. One just doesn't come away terribly enlightened.The main reason provided as to why the DCT might be better than the DFT in some instances is that it is a more compact encoder of Markov sequences. Great, but what does this mean in practise? Well, the authors give many applications, but they are dealt with briefly, with little insight, and in a encyclopedic manner. Better would have been a few simple applications, done in more detail, where the authors made crystal clear why the DCT is the tool for the job.I was hoping to come away with an in-depth understanding as to the properties of the DCT, where it's best applied, and why. I was disappointed."
3,LZ's worst record,"In the midst of the rise of Aerosmith, Ted Nugent, etc. in 1976, it is no coincidence that Jimmy Page made this one rock harder than any other. The problem here is that, with the notable exception of the tightly-executed ""Nobody's Fault But Mine"", the song-writing is uninspired and, since an injured and grieving Robert Plant was phoning in his performance, the result was not satisfactory. Many cite ""Achilles Last Stand"" as a highlight, but I find that it goes about 4-5 minutes too long. The same is true of the slow blues attempt, ""Tea for One"". The rest of the record is truly unmemorable, although the original album cover art is one of my favorites of all time (even if it does play off of '2001: A Space Odyssey'). Aside from the postumously released 'Coda' (1982), this should be the last addition to your LZ collection."
2,"too much art, too little food and lodging","I was very disappointed in the book - I was expecting a lot of useful advice on finding a comfortable hotel and an inexpensive meal, but there was almost no info on those topics. Instead, Steves gives great detail on the few items he thinks you should see in the major museums of London. Well, thanks, but my taste in art differs from his. In something the size of the British Museum, putting together a sort of ""Greatest Hits"" list is ridulous; there's too many fabulous pieces in too many categories for a small section of guidebook to do the reader anything but a disservice. Much better to use the Museum's extensive resources on site to find your personal favorites.Steves would far better serve his readers by giving some SPECIFIC info on restaurants, not just broad categories of places to seek out."
5,Another Helpful Travel Guide by Rick Steves,"I just love Rick Steves guides to Europe. I used to use Frommers' only but Rick's are so much better. I appreciate how he keeps them up to date and accurate. He gives the information needed in a useful, fun manner--not at all stuffy. We enjoy his walks in each city and the hotel and restaurant suggestions that we have tried have been right on the money."
4,A Magical Journey,"Steven Spielberg's ""Hook"", and like so many of his other films, contains so much magic, and unforgettable scenes,characters, and moments, it is overwhelming. This film is one of the most visionary and magical ones i think i have ever seen. Steven Spielberg is truly a genius. If you are a fan of his movies, or you just want to be whisped away to a world away from the one you live in, then you must buy this film. It is a must."
2,"Hideously over-produced, loud, garish spectacle","When our son was about 7, he received this movie as a gift, and watched it pretty frequently. The other day it occurred to me, as the now 10-year-old boy was watching some movie, that he hadn't pulled ""Hook"" out of its case in about 2 years or so. I was finally able to put a finger on what had always annoyed me about this movie --- it is the sort of movie that an 8-year-old would produce, given an appropriate budget.The sets are pretty spectacular, but seem to be an end in and of themselves. The presentation is simply relentless, and seems more focused on launching an all-out assault on the senses of the hapless movie viewer. Lost in all the hubbub & spectacle is a coherent plot. Apparently, the surface details are more important than a storyline, decent performances, etc. I doubt our son will be watching this anymore, and for this I am grateful."
4,"""Hook"" with the granddaughters","We must have watched ""Hook"" 100 times on VHS with our daughter and our first grandson. We ordered it from Amazon on Blu-ray and it was like the first time we watched it. Our granddaughters thought it was great. It was well worth the money for Blu-ray."
1,embarrassing,"Seldom has so much talent (and MONEY!) been wasted on such unentertaining silliness.Robin Williams, Dustin Hoffman, Maggie Smith, Julia Roberts, Bob Hoskins--it is painful to watch them cope with the bad writing, overemoting, over-elaborate (and dull) sets, and just general aimlessness of this picture.Everybody works REALLY hard, and the strain shows.The fun seems forced, the situations pointless, the message ham-handed, and the music--oh, my goodness--the music is the most syruppy mess this side of ""Pearl Harbor.""Even the special effects are less than special.All in all, very uncomfortable to sit through."
4,Great family movie,"This was always a fun movie to watch as a kid and is still entertaining as an adult. The only difference is that now I notice the graphics are low quality in some scenes, and the movie seems to be a little too long. They could have edited some of it out, since it seems to drag on at times. It is funny seeing Gwyneth Paltrow and Julia Roberts in their roles since they seem so different. A classic Peter Pan adaptation that I do recommend!"
2,Slow moving and overlong,This movie could have been great but it is far from it.It is probably one of the worst movies Robin Williamsand Dustin Hoffman ever made. It is slow moving andabout an hour too long. Most of the scenes with the LostBoys could have been eliminated.
2,lacks magic,"My son is obsessed with the Disney cartoon of Peter Pan, so it was natural that he would want to see this. One of my joys with my kids is revisiting things that I loved at their age as well as discovering new things. Unfortunately, though the incomparable Spielberg was involved, this film is wholly lacking in that indefinable magic that makes for greatness. I found the whole thing flat, the acting poor to fair even with Robin Williams, and the attempt to add on to an wholly contained work of art a dimsal failure. You shouldn't try to make a knockoff of something that stands perfectly on its own. This is the worst that I ever saw in a Spielberg film. The only things going for it are special effects and rollicking violence.Not recommended."
1,No answers here,"As a skeptic looking for valid reasons to reconsider Christianity, I was really looking for some good information. I've already educated myself with works on Biblical scholarship and archeology. Needless to say I was disappointed with what is offered in this book. McDowell states that Moses wrote the first five books of the Bible as if it were accepted fact--which it is not--and doesn't offer any evidence to the contrary. All the archeological evidence is pre-1970 and there have been significant discoveries in the last 30 years!There is nothing in here that made me reconsider my position on the reliability of the contradicting Gospels, or that Jesus was a man and not a god.Needless to say, this book turned me even farther away from considering Christianity as a religion."
2,Pick and choose method counterproductive,"In the hope of finding useful information in this book, I was sorely disappointed. The author uses a ""pick and choose"" technique, only supplying the reader with information which will back the cause of the author. He uses some teachings of the Early Fathers, councils, etc. to back the his cause. But when those same people or councils contradict what the author was trying to sell you into believing, they were obviously not given any credibility. How can a council be credible in one area, and ignored in another? As a Christian, I find this ""pick and choose"" method counterproductive for the person who is searching for the truth. There are better books on the market for those who are truly searching. I have also read briefly Jeff Lowder's page (address is given in a previous review) and there are some good points there. I suggest you all to give it a check before you decide whether or not to purchase this book."
1,Unconvincing and quite uninformed,"This book is quite a joke in learned circles. It's shallow arguments based on nonexistent or little supported facts are clearly designed for those who want ""good"" reasons to believe but who aren't looking for crticism.That McDowell was an atheist as most would understand it is debatable; and that he was going to find answers to prove Christianity wrong at the library of the religious school he attended is unlikely.Any book that quotes Napoleon's belief in Jesus as a proof of Christianity (by way of ""intelligent people sure believe it so it must be true"") is suspect.If anyone is interested in more thorough arguments, search the web for ""A Verdict that Demands some Evidence."" This is a point-by-point refutation of volume 1."
2,Shallow and unconvincing to anyone well read,"This book will convince only those who are already Christians who would never question their faith- no matter what, or those who are intellectual lightweights. The author does not make any pretense of having rigorously searched for the truth before arriving at his foregone conclusions. Rather, he ignores biblical and historical scholarship in blind devotion to his one-sided preconceived conlusions. If anyone wants to examine whether the bible really is the inerrant word of God, I recommend reading ""THE FIVE GOSPELS-WHAT DID JESUS REALLY SAY"" by Robert Funk, Roy Hoover, and the Jesus Seminar."
3,"Good info, but not enough to pass the test.","I recently took the Security+ exam and used this book as my only Study Guide. I have years of experience in IT, but I failed the test on my first attempt. This book does present some good information - but there were areas covered in the test that this book doesn't touch. Don't depend on it as your only information source to pass the test - it's not enough."
3,Good Secondary Resource,This book was a good secondary resource for studying for the Security+ exam. It was often found wanting on detail and depth. It also gave only lip service to non-Microsoft operating systems (I'm almost surprised they were included at all). This book did provide good back up on particular topics to augment the primary resource for my successful study (the Sybex book). In the used market this book is cheap; buy it on that basis for a secondary study resource only.
3,?value?,Be sure you order more than just this item from the vendor. The shipping was the same or more than this item costs.
4,Para Toda Vida,"This new New Amsterdams CD id twice as good as the last one. It keeps you in touch with both an acoustic and emotional calm as well as bluegrass roots (track 6). Careful, these tunes are bound to get stuck in your head. My personal favorite is Stay On the Phone (track 4) because it's different than all the others. Overall I think it's great and well worth buying."
2,Saddened...,"I am also saddened to see the blatant mis-use and commercialization of the Reiki symbols. The cd's are indeed lovely, but I feel that the artist has no respect for the energy or the sacred nature of the sybols. Very similar to Madonna using crucifixes in her stage settings and videos. How crass!"
3,Dissapointing Movie,The theme song for Knight Rider 2000 was bad. Not half as good as the original theme song. The film starts off slowly but it gets better as it goes along. I find it hard to believe that Michael Knight didn't have a girlfriend in the film. He was always surrounded by women in the original series. KITT always performed great stunts. The only stunt in this film is when KITT drives on water. Nice but not that interesting. I expected more action and more stunts. When the show aired it was well received but I thought it could've been better. I think most fans will watch it out of a sense of nostalgia but will end up being mildly dissapointed. Recommended for die hard fans of the original series looking for one last glimpse at a campy series with good stunts and a charismatic lead.
2,NOT a jacket,"I would not classify this article of clothing as a ""jacket."" The material is very lightweight, about the equivalent of an inexpensive denim shirt.It looks ok but certainly wasn't what I expected from the description."
3,Its O.K.,"My son is very tall for his age, 35"" at 18 months, but his feet still don't touch the ground on both sides at the same time. He loves it, don't get me wrong, and he loves to make the vroom vroom noise just like his Dad's motorcycle, but after he gets off of it he rides his Honda 4 wheeler replica"
2,Very unstable and annoying for kids,"My son got this when he was about 2 and a half, horrible. He's constantly falling over on his leg on this thing because it's really unstable. It's not just that he's too little, it's that any time he goes around a corner he can't hold it upright. I daughter has the same issue...so meh. Looks fun, but really isn't truth be told. Go with something four-wheeled."
2,Poor Quality,"I got this toy for my 2 year old that loves motorcycles. I got it home and was surprised at the poor quality plastic that it is made of. First it had a dent in the side and I unable to get out and I was just completely disappointed in it. My little boy isn't even excited about it either. I will be returning it, because of the dent and my little boy doesn't play with it. Definitely NOT a 30 dollar toy."
5,Great Fun Inside or Out,"This was a Christmas gift for my 2 year old. It is the most played with gift he received this year. It is small enough he can zoom around the house on it without banging up the walls! He rides it all day long and takes his teddy bears for rides on it too. The very first time he got on it and gave a push, he relized that it would take some balancing, but since then, he's had no real problems with it tipping over. It was easy to put together and seems very durable. I am so glad we got this for him."
4,good lil toy,"quality is good , description was right on, can stuff with paper or treats for foraging, and had a clip on both ends for optional hanging .."
2,Annoying Writing Style,"The author's writing style is annoying. Almost every sentence is followed by 'i.e.', and/or the overused of parenthesized or dashed words to further elaborate on a point.... Moreover, I did not expect to have come across so many 'We' in a technical book such as this. I certainly would not recommend this book on anybody's reading list."
2,Base is nice but spice canisters are cheaply made,"I had this on my wish list and got it as a present. It looks good on picture but not as good in use. Top and bottom have very nice stainless steel look, easily rotates, however, canisters are made from some cheap plastic, some tops do not close after opened only once. Also not very happy with the choice of spices, I only use a few from this set. Do not recommend."
4,Caddyshack,Great movie..... For anyone who wants to be the ball...........Bill Murray at his best..........
4,Caddy Shack,A true classic. I can view this 100 times and still laugh. I would like to add that UStrade did a fine job in shipping a replacement DVD when I had a problem with the first one.
2,review of caddyshack dvd,"Quality of the voicetrack was poor, to the point it was difficult to hear the dialogue. The background sounds were loud, but voices poorly audible. Seems to be a common problem with dvd's made for older (pre-dvd) movies. we had a similar problem on a previously purchased dvd, except that time the voices were fine, but the music soundtrack was almost inaudible."
2,Not as good as I remembered.,"I recently viewed this movie and was disappointed. I saw this movie in the theater when it was released and had memories of it being better. This film is not near as good as Animal House, The Blues Brothers, and Airplane which are comedies that came out during the same era."
4,Funny Movie,The movie is funny and even our young kids liked it. I remember when it first came out and the jokes are still good.
4,"Great Movie, DVD transfer is no improvemnt","Obviously rushed out, the DVD version of this classic doesn't add much. The extras are unexciting, no widescreen, pretty much the same as the VHS version except it won't wear out when you watch it every week!"
2,ONE OF THE FUNNIEST MOVIES EVER MADE? NOT REALLY!,"This was NOT one of my favorite movie comedys.The only Actor who was funny was dangerfield.This film contains an overdose of adult content, and nudity.Some scenes had absolutely nothing to do with the country club.And it was suppose to be a golf movie.Some scenes were funny but not to make the movie good. Chase walks right through his role as the goofy Ty Webb.Murray tries to be funny with his gopher wisecracks but just isn't."
3,3 stars for disappointing video quality only,"A must see for golfers and comedy lovers alike, the video quality is a real letdown. No widescreen version in this one. I couldn't tell if I was watching DVD or VCR!"
2,Not Funny...,"I don't know why this film is considered a such a classic comedy, especially considering that it was released in the same year as the single greatest film comedy of all time, ""Airplane!"".Caddyshack has some funny moments, basicley Rodney dangerfield's all too brief appearences, but that's not enough to carry a whole movie. The biggest mistake in this piece of ... was focusing on the kid (Danny, I think) instead of Dangerfiled. Still Dangerfield is always a joy to watch and there is this one hot scene with Ted Knights ... daughter that's pretty good, but for pure laughs I just can't recommend it. Watch ""Airplane"" instead."
2,Is a better DVD version coming????,"This vesion is a rare direct video to DVD transfer, not much for one's money. Hopefully the 20th Anniversary release of video will also prompt an improvement in the DVD. There are loads of cut and lost scenes that could be added to a DVD that would improve this release greatly."
5,One of the Best!,A movie classic. You will not be disappointed. Definitely one to buy so you can watch whenever you want. Great!
5,Wow!,A well researched and stunning documentary about the biblical star of Bethlehem! It's worth every penny of what you'll spend on it!
2,LIMITED BY EVANGELICAL CHRISTIAN VIEW,"THE INFORMATION IS GOOD BUT THE DELIVERY COULD BE BETTER. IT TAKES PLACE IN A CLASSROOM-LIKE SETTING, PERHAPS A LIBRARY, WITH A SMALL AUDIENCE OF WHAT APPEAR TO BE EVANGELICAL CHRISTIANS. THE AUTHOR HIMSELF IS AN EVANGELICAL CHRISTIAN OF SOME SORT. HIS FREQUENT QUOTES FROM THE BIBLE ARE PERTINENT AND HELPFUL, ESPECIALLY FOR THOSE OF US NON-EVAGELICAL CHRISTIANS WHO ARE NOT WELL-VERSED WITH THE BIBLE. HOWEVER, IT IS CLEAR THAT THE AUTHOR'S INTENDED AUDIENCE IS EVANGELICAL CHRISTIANS. THE EVANGELICAL EMPHASIS LIMITS HOW FAR HE TAKES THE SUBJECT OF THE STAR AS WELL AS HIS THEORIES. AS IT STANDS IT DOES NOT HAVE WIDE APPEAL. ASIDE FROM THE OBVIOUS LIMITATIONS OF AN EVANGELICAL CHRISTIAN VIEW, THE CLASSROOM-LIKE SETTING MAKES IT RATHER DULL."
5,Not just for Christmas!,"This is not only a well-done video presentation, it's a wonderful proof of God's sovereignty, that He is real, and the Bible is true and can be taken literally. I've ordered several copies to serve as my ""Christmas cards"" to family and friends this year, but I'm sending them out by Thanksgiving. I've shared it with about 8 young people ages 18-25, all to positive reviews! REMINDER: don't miss the bonus feature after the credits roll at the end! Wonderful gift, have checked out sources, the theory expressed in this presentation appears very credible. Thanks to Mr. Larson, Mr. Vidano, their staffs, families and friends who have worked to share this information. Bless you all!"
5,Worth every penny,A Christmas eve tradition in our household and a wonderful reminder of the precision of God
1,Very disappointing,"I gave this one star because I could not give it zero stars. The lecturer spends the first 10-15 minutes of the program talking about why he did the research. As I watched this, my thought was, ""So?"" As the program continues, Mr. Larson talks about his worry that he was studying astrology. He did not know the difference between astrology and astromomy? He finally came to the obvious conclusion that a study of astronomy was ok. I had hoped to use this program with my Sunday School class, but it is just not interesting enough. Do not waste your money."
4,Online Video and Kit,"This is a great product and I highly recommend it.BTW, there is a free video available online which gives a synopsis of this information, it's available at this site:[...]The company that did the video also provides kits that allow you to recreate the events in your own home that the video describes. One of my neighbors put up the star mural in their home for their kids, and it was a huge success. They were able to use it to teach their kids about the Star of Bethlehem and also astronomy."
4,Good reasoning well presented,"Mr Larson makes a good case for identifying the Star of Bethlehem with Jupiter, making significant conjunctions with Regulus and Venus. There's no glaring gaps in the logic that I can see. I searched the web for criticisms, and the only ones I found were either people dismissing the whole idea that the Star of Bethlehem was historical or people who preferred their own theory to his."
5,The Star of Bethlehem,"Excellent illustration of our current technology in how we now have the ability to prove the Bible as accurate.Those of us who've wondered when Jesus the Christ was born have their questions answered in this outstanding DVD.This DVD, The Star Of Bethlehem, is educational and inspiring to the non believer as well as the beleiver.Prior to puchasing this DVD for our family members as Christmas gifts, we viewd it. Our family enjoyed it.Will recommend to our family and friends."
4,Great for Beginners,"Cute ball gag - doesn't taste bad, adjusts easily enough. It does its job, keeping the people upstairs unaware of what is happening beneath them."
4,Loud!!! But fun,"I'm on board with everyone else. This game is very annoying as far as the noise goes. The makers of this game would be wise to shut the quacking down while still allowing the ducks to ""swim"" around the circle. But my 2 1/2 year old son loves it and understood the color matching right away. I do like how big the button (on/off switch) is, it's easy for him to shutthe game off by himself."
4,Daughter Loves it & I HATE IT,"My daughter absolutely loves this game! It is one of her favorite games. My only complaint is, WHY o WHY couldn't they have put an on / off switch on this game! We stack our games up on the shelves and if you place any games on top of this larger box game it will start quacking and is impossible to get to shut off! I considered taking the batteries out but you must unscrew the compartment. What a hassle for each time you want to play. Even though this game quacks all the time, the batteries have held out well and structurally it has held out excellent considering we are always beating on the box to get it to shut up! If the company would but a shut off button on this game, I would quickly throw this one in the trash and race off to buy one with a shut off button. Still a great game for children."
4,Can hear the quacking now...,"I purchased this toy for our son (4) after he brought it home from the library on multiple occasions. He loves this simple game, that teaches him so much about winning and losing. His sister (1) has started to ""fight"" with him to grab the ducks.....it's now his turn to teach her how to make the ducks swim around the pond, as well as the different colors needed to win. This is a fun toy for little ones."
3,GOOD UNDERSTANDING FOR THE BEGINNER,"I was somewhat disappointed in this book, since the book was a little ""too simple"" for me. However, it is very informative for the person who has never touched a keyboard before. And I am sure it would increase that person's confidence at the piano."
4,alright for starters,"while reading the reviews for most of the more popular piano learning books i decided that this one sounded best for me. me being an amature pianist(excuse my spelling please). and when i recieved it i opened it and started looking through the book to see if it was what i wanted. though it is a good book it was not what i expected. there are a whole lot more things to read on playing. though this is not bad. there is a poor selection of titles to play. and after a while playing the limited songs over and over, gets pretty boring. but overall i think it was a worthwhile investment. and the only recomendation that i can give to anyone is ""if you want a lot of easy music to play this is not the book for you"""
1,[bad],"If you like bugs, glitches and spending your time reading tech forums at UBI, buy this game, and the original Ghost Recon. Some people have no problems, but many do. Unfortuantely I am one of them. I have a Pentium III 1.1 GHZ 256 mb ram and windows MEwith a GeForce 2 MX 400 64 mb vid card, and I experience a bunch of bugs, even after patching. Personally, I think this game needed a few more months in development. If you enjoy Operation Flashpoint, RTCW, Medal of Honor, DONT buy this game or the original. The graphics are a notch above Delta Force 2, and for some unknown reason the developers decide not to show your characters hands or weapon in your view. So basically, you have a little reticule to aim around and you have to imagine or guess where you are standing. [bad]. Realistic? I dont think so... last time I checked, I could see my own hands in real life...save your hard earned duckets for a real game..."
3,Too short.,"Nice change of locale, but no major improvements in graphics or gameplay. Should have been offered for free as a downloadable mod from UbiSoft or Red Storm Entertainment's website.Fun missions, but too short a campaign for the price."
4,"Well written, well organized, very practical","I was leary when I saw the words ""practical guide"" in the title as I find that the phrase is often far from the truth. I guess I was in a gambling mood because I took a shot and found that this is a rare case where the advice here is actually implementable. The book includes detailed case studies, very specific advice on appropriate measures or ""pillars"" as the author calls them of IT project value, and lists of sample questions and metrics for each pillar.All in all this is a very useful book for justifying IT projects particularly in today's environment when your pal the CFO is squeezing every penny trying to get blood out."
2,Not so good,Ms. Lowell has done better. She probably had a deadline. It is best to miss it and keep readers.
1,Boring,"I strongly felt that Elizabeth Lowell was only walking through this book for a paycheck. The sordid characters were stock, without any redeeming or quirky qualities that fleshed them out into human beings. The main characters were also stock - yet another brilliant and beautiful heroine, yet another brilliant and handsome hero. There was no real passion in this book, no in depth relationship between them. Lowell comes across as burned out and bored. I found that I was burned out and bored as I read this. I know this is a rather scathing review, but part of the reason I feel this strongly is that I think Lowell can do much better and has. I hope she will again in the future."
5,tons of fun,"As a family game, we have tons of fun.The kids really get into it. They have to usetheir imagination. The whole family loves it."
3,Pictionary Jr,"This game was purchased for my grand daughter for Christmas, and she loves it. I have not had the opportunity to play it with her, but she plays with her friends and has alot of laughs."
4,Definitely a good buy!,"Went to Paris in 2008 for the first time. Brought this book and DK Paris guide. Took both to Paris because there are info in Rick Steves not in DK and vice versa. Whereas the DK has colored photos, Rick Steves Paris guide is in black and white, hence, lighter in weight. Really valued bringing Rick Steves guide because there were specific directions on how to get to hospitals (Yes, hospitals as my traveling companion had allergies that drugs from local pharmacies could not alleviate.). While DK Paris tell you the address of hospitals, Rick Steves actually tells you how to travel there. Definitely saved the trip! Make sure you check out Rick Steves' website for they have many useful tips!"
2,Doesn't really work on the Kindle,"While this is the usual good Rick Steves book, the Kindle edition lacks the maps (other than a few line drawings) which you need in a guidebook. So if you thought you could take this to Paris and use as your main guidebook, you would be disappointed. The text is fine, and is typically useful, but it is hard to figure out where things are without maps."
4,The not-so secret life of dogs,"This is a powerful tale that presents the psychology of a dog's mind, as transparent to the reader. The influence of London's writing style is seen in countless modern novels, and has the ability to transport you emotionally to the cold desolate artic. It's a dog lovers story, without the sappiness of such tales told in the more contemporary voice. His conclusions, are rational, and any one who loves animals should hear them...dogs are dogs...and that's OK."
5,Zelda,this is a great book!if you don't have you should buy it if have the game.i bought it having goten stuck in the shadow temple.i also bought this book because i lost my other one.i'm trying to collect all the legend of zelda orcarna of time guides.i'm a big fan of link things.i bought this here for a really cheap price of a dollar.good work verus!
5,LOVELY BOOK,I recently bought this book for the child of a friend and I am not dissapointed! It is a beautiful book with excellent pictures...a book which I hope will instill a respect for books in this childs life.
4,Peter Pan (100th Edition),Nice book and a good keepsake. Larger than expected therefore not good reading material for taking with you whilst travelling.
1,"Certainly not a ""Disney"" or Dave Barry version","We bought this audio version after listening to all the Jim Dale readDave Barry stories. Thought that Jim Dale's delightful reading wouldbe great. We have listened to all the Harry Potters, IronHand series,Emerald Atlas and anxiously await the October release of the next in theEmerald Atlas series but...we made it through the 2nd disk and gave up.It is the unabridged version and I know that it is the original story;I'm just not ready for Tink really trying to kill Wendy, Peter enjoyingkilling a pirate as often as possible or thinning out the Lost Boys whenthere got to be too many or even Hook gutting a pirate who came too close.I prefer the Peter interpreted Tink responses and the more child orientedversion from Dave Barry. BTW I am 60 years old and love all of these stories."
5,I fell in love with Peter!,"""Peter pan"" is one of the best book I love. As like Wendy, when I was a child I loved Peter from my heart. He is a real child, never never grow up and know dirty or gain unnecessary wisdom.. I seriously wanted to fly away to the Neverland. I think it is very difficult to become an adult with innocence. The child grow up to forget how to fly and don't believe fairly or romantic things. So I hope I would be a child forever. I don't want to be an adult. I think this book is not only adventure, but also sad love story about Peter and Wendy. Wendy fell in love with Peter but he hoped her to be a mother. I wanted them to become happy. Child wants love but when he gets it, he is no longer a child. It is heartless contradiction. The last part of this story is very sad, I think."
3,Axion 7 inches display,"It works well for the price paid. Not the bet and not the worst but will do the job for display. Haven't found a way to program the pics to stay longer on. Can't seem to find the batteries cavity as first reviewed by other users. May be I should check the manual again. However, still a nice product for the price paid for."
2,Too verbose,"Should've been 30 pages, not 300, as someone else pointed out. Too much fluff, too little about either Beethoven or forensic science, too much rambling."
1,False Advertising,"Anything of value that, this book has to say, could have been put into ten pages. The writer sucks one in, hoping that the highly touted scientific evidence will reveal something about Beethoven; it doesn't. Ludwig may have suffered from lead poisoning and did not use opiates at the end. That's it.The author inadvertently presents some important issues, having nothing to do about Beethoven, but showing us how 9/11/02 was and is nearly identical to Germany in January and February of 1934 and that there were some decent people in Denmark and Sweden during WWII. The rest is mostly irrelevant minutiae of the most boring sort, an insult to both Beethoven and the writing of history."
2,For newborns more than toddlers,"Everytime my 2 year old falls asleep in his carseat his head tilts to the side in a very uncomfortable looking position. We were looking for some kind of a neck pillow and tried this to keep his head situated up. When attached to the seatbelts, this will keep his from rolling from side to side but his head still slides forward. He ends up with his chin on his chest. I tried to take it off of the belts and place it so it holds his chin up, and it didn't really offer much support for his head. It would probably work great with smaller children though!"
2,Disappointed,"These didn't work well and my little girls head still fell forward. These are hard to put around the head/neck when the child is asleep and when they are awake they don't want the head support around their head- it was aggravating to her. Maybe this would work better for a smaller infant, but not a child over 6 months in my opinion."
5,Makes a thoughtful shower gift!,"I only wish these things were around when my child was an infant. We had alot of trouble keeping her head up during the first month, before her neck muscles were strong enough to keep it up herself.This is a great device, something useful. I bought this for a baby shower gift."
5,Great Product!,"I bought this for my second son's infant carseat before he was born. My first son always had a slumpy head in his carseat and the rainbow shaped head supports were useless. This works great. It did a wonderful job of keeping his head supported even when we were comming home from the hospital and I am still using it today, 5 mos. later. I wish I would have had one for my older son, and I would definately recommend it."
1,Cradler doesn't work for older kids,"My son is 8 months old. He has outgrown his infant car seat, and is now in a larger seat, but still rear facing. I bought the cradler to prevent his head from slumping forward when he falls asleep in the seat. It does not help in this regard at all. In fact, it just annoys him. I have taken it off the car seat entirely, and I'm not using it at all.Very disappointed in California"
2,flimsly,just a little head movement and the headsupport was askew. didnt stay in place at all and become more of an annoyance.
2,"Hmmm, just ok.","I tried this cleaner (twice) after the reading the reviews on this site. I followed the tips given on this site, heavily sprinkled and really brushed in before letting dry and vacuuming up. My carpet is cream colored with very obvious high traffic areas. Although the carpet showed a little improvement, I think it really needs a good shampoo cleaning as oppossed to a light refreshing."
3,Works great but is horrible with allergies,This works great and really make the carpets look good. But I had a problem with the smell. It made my allergies act up so bad that I had to wear a cleaning mask just so I could deal with the smell when I was sprinkling it. I found after you vacuumed it up the smell was not so bad. But it was horrible when you are sprinkling it. Atleast for my allergies.
3,"Works OK, but overpriced",Didn't notice a big difference. I think it's the same stuff as the Host Carpet Cleaner available at most Ace Hardware stores at less than half the cost.
3,"Ok, but not sure what it really does...","I purchased the dyson pet and it works amazing wonders on pet hair, but so does the $50.00 version from K-Mart. I'm not really sure what the zorb does besides smelling clean for about 5 minutes!"
2,"the book needs to focus on the point, and not story telling.","this text hops from one place to another. the points are presented well, but are redundant."
1,You don't have to deny hate?,If you buy into this book all the victims would or could have been perpetrators. Doesn't happen that way in real life. There were those who helped or rescued others and those who were extremists and a lot of others caught in between--though they too had choices but were too conforming to the culture. Apologists for genocide and those who point to the few victims that acted as horrific as the perpetrators are lost to the fairy tales of hate.
5,Surf Geniuses in Guitar Attack!,"I love this album. I have the original vinyl that I bought back in '83, '84. Great surf instrumentals, energy and technique all there. I wonder if this is the American or British version, however. The British version of ""Pirahna Salad"" beats the American version hands down, for some reason. And Danny something-or-other (immortalized in the db's song ""Amplifier""...you know, ""Danny went and hung himself today..."") in this is now in Los Straitjackets, who cover ""The Calhoun Surf"" on their first album! If you like surf or instrumental rock (not always the same thing), then buy this album now."
3,"Not a true live album, but still good.","Even though this is a edit of many performances that the band did during their stay at MSG in '73, it is still not as bad as many fans have said about this. To bad ""Since I've Been Loving You"" which was in the movie itself but not included on this soundtrack. ""Stairway To Heaven"" is done very well and does show Zeppelin at that time. Yes, there are hundreds of bootlegs of that tour and yes, most of them are better than this disc. Pick up the cd for the great version of ""No Quarter"" and ""The Rain Song."" As a collector of many Zep recordings, I still like to listen to this cd and hope that Robert will get off his high horse and let Jimmy release what is and has been in the vaults since Zeppelin started. This is a great starter ""live"" cd for you Zeppelin newbies out there to get an idea of how the band sounded in concert."
2,BBBBBBOOOOOOOORRRRRRIIIIIIIIINNNNNNGGGGGGG,"Every 5 star review is a lie. A damn lie. This album is really ,really boring. Well it's Led Zeppelin isn't it , it's only to be expected."
5,Underrated,"I don't understand all the criticism that surrounds ""The Song Remains the Same"" 2 CD soundtrack collection and home video. Although ""Dazed and Confused"" and ""Moby Dick"" are a bit drawn out in time length, they showcase the awesome musical talents of Page and Bonham. Meanwhile, the versions of ""Rock and Roll,"" ""Celebration Day,"" and ""The Song Remains the Same"" glow like a blue flame under a stove burner. Often the ""BBC Sessions"" CD set is put on a pedestal above ""Song."" This is not understandable as ""BBC"" includes multiple recordings of ""I Can't Quit You,"" for example, that tire the listener out by its 3rd play from the same disk. Also, Plant's voice cracks in ""The Immigrant Song"" and ""Black Dog"" on ""BBC."" With ""The Song Remains the Same,"" you are getting Led Zeppelin in their prime. The music is crisp, clear, yet heavier than a lead balloon. This is the king of rock and roll live records."
5,Thoughts of Germany!,"I recently returned from a vacation in Germany where I took a chance and purchased this whole-bean coffee from a supermarket chain in Munich. Wow, I am sorry I did not purchase more bags; it's got a fantastic, smooth flavor, much like my favorite coffee from Vienna - Eduscho Melange. Thankfully for the internet, I don't have to fly to Germany to buy more, although I'd do so in a heartbeat!"
1,computer problems,"This was a very interesting game, requiring a joystick. I wanted to play it, but it kept freezing up on my year 2000 PC with much more than the stated system requirements, video cards, etc. Lucas Arts said I should try downloading some video patches that do not exist anymore (remember, my computer is years(?) beyond this product), but they warned me the patches could crash my computer. Gee, thanks for wasting my money."
4,Good til the end,"The races were fun and the difficulty level increased at a good rate. Though getting first in all of the races, it became boring once they were all completed. The Winning Screen (on the pillars) was the same every time. Something different could have been done for more excitement. Now only multiplayer is exciting."
5,A total blast!,Simply the best driving game I've played. Almost too much fun! It's terrific to play when you don't have much time to play. A race can be won in minutes or you can play for hours. Worth the $!
5,The best race game ever,I Love this game I have been looking for it a long time. the only problem is I can't get it to work on my 64 bit machine.
5,wow,"I never heard of this band until they opened for TMBG in Cincinnati. They were amazing -fun, creative songs - great voice. This album was a real treat, and is leaps and bounds over their previous work Pleasureland."
2,"Ok, but really not great","The Mexican setting is interesting, and the story is ok, if self-indulgent and not remarkable. But the main character is consistently annoying and it grows hard to sympathize with someone so shallow, self-hurting and unaware. Furthermore, the cover is the only part of the book that shows real penmanship... Browse through it before buying."
2,Just a toy...,"The problem is the reception range, which is miserable. Clear reception is for only a couple of hundred feet, provided there are no obstacles. The signal disappears completely at about 1/2 of a mile. However, in the Magic Kingdom park of Disneyworld in Florida, we had difficulty maintaining any communication at all, probably due to a lot of buildings and steel structures around. Therefore, I consider these units as not a real communications devices, but rather just children's toys. Also, in this case, clearly, you get what you pay for: the item is cheap and it works like a cheap item."
2,Big Dissapointment,This game is nothing like any of the previous worms games. It was simply a big dissapointment and not worth the money.
3,An Ambiguous Reading Experience,"I read this early book by Tim Farrington after having read his later book ""The Monk Downstairs,"" in the expectation that, like the ""Momk,"" it would be a straightforward novel, with a clearly discernible plot---only to find instead a narrative whose focus enlarged (more and more ""characters,"" with rather parodic names and increasingly obvious satiric emphasis)that made me unsure of both the tone and the author's intention in writing it. Adding to my uncertainty are blurbs by other reviewers (one calling the dialog ""hilarious"" and another labelling the work ""a good-natured satire""). The ""Questions for Discussion"" provided at the book's conclusion have done nothing to allay my doubts.Rose B. Robinson[...]"
4,Just keep going with the train,"Just keep buying the daughter love's it , cute and good attention to details ,complete the set well and I guess we will keep on going"
4,Great Product,"I love this receiver. They packed a lot of good options into this little receiver with only small compromises. DVD player and CD player work perfect. My only problem - the supplied antenna does not pick up anything for me, reception was pretty good after adding amplified 75 ohm connection antenna."
4,Good overall- very compact,"Not a real good start, because the unit I received was an open box. Obviously returned and repacked. It was fine, but at this price, I expected a factory sealed carton (or a discount).The unit itself is perfect for my situation. I replaced my broken receiver and DVD player with a single device. It was small enough that I could move my speakers back on the shelf with the receiver and my media PC. The sound is great, but It's more about a wide range of functionality in a narrow package. As someone noted it is pretty deep, but that is not an issue for me."
4,"Good selection, but small.","This set has a nice selection of colors. The one negative is the amount of play-dough in each container, they are very small canisters. If you've used play-dough, you know what your getting. My daughter is happy."
5,"Dreamy, Intelligent Songs That Move You","I recently re-discovered this gem after several years of having it gather dust on my shelf, and boy am I glad I did. It is a real masterpiece from an under-rated band.Poi weaves together guitars, drums, violins, flutes, cellos, pianos and more to create an enchanting and driving sound -- one that is never as dischordant as you would expect. Each of the 11 songs is strong on its own, but together they play out like a supremely well-crafted symphony. ""Complicated"" forces you to get to your feet and dance, while ""Pomegranate"" is a more mellow exploration of sounds. The lyrics to ""God's Gallipoli"" are worth memorizing for their power. This is a diverse and challenging album that may not be immediately accessable to all listeners, but I urge you to stick with it. You will be richly rewarded."
4,great little brackets but be careful,"these brackets are great, but care needs to be taken when putting the screws in. when putting in the screws, don't put them in all the way, stop just before the metal begins to deform (as the screw pulls it towards the wood). this will result in more uniform saw horses."
4,"ALRIGHT! FINALLY, some real down home punctuation action!","You want to know about semicolons? You like learning big time about hyphens (where did I forget to use one)? Well brother, you came to the right place! Get this book and it'll be a punctuation party until dawn! Yeah! It loses a star due to its unfair treatment of the ellipsis."
1,Misprinted mess!,"The original text of this book, printed by other publishers, is a masterpiece of good advice and clarity on the subject of punctuation. This particular edition is a misprinted mess, with typos, nonsense words, and ""examples of punctuation"" that actually do not include any punctuation. The publisher of this book charges the customer $20, but apparently didn't bother to hire a proofreader to go through the book. If I could give this book negative stars, I would. I returned it, of course, and ordered an old, used edition of this book previously printed by another publisher."
4,Next still got it !!!,"First I would like to say that I was [upset] that Next didn't get too much air play or recognition for this cd because it was very good. This is their most mature cd which shows how much they've grown in three years.When I first got this cd, I must admit that I wasn't hooked on it like I thought I would've been. But when I started listening to this cd on a regular basis, I became addicted! You will never see me without my Next and RL cd's, EVER!!!My Most Favorite Songs:My Love, All Because of you, Lights Out, Imagine That, That's My Word,Brand New, and Do your Thing.My cool Songs:Your Love Is,I'm Tryin To What,Just Like That,Feels Good,Hold me Down, Freakyman, and It's Okay.My Moody/sometimes good song:Girl, Lady, WomanBesides that one song this cd is very raw and I love Next with my life. I hope they make another cd cuz they are very talented guys and I would hate to see them stop over this one cd because it didn't have platinum status."
4,Simply the Best!,"I don't have any LPs by Next, but as I got this one I was very surprised. The LP is a nearly perfect mixture between club and soul and has many singles to come out. The best song on this LP is ""Feels Good (Track No.7)"" which comes down with a nice Christmas mood and makes you feel positive. The funny thing about this LP is, that the odd tracks are the best singles! Track7, 9, 11, 13, 15! It's one of the best RNB LPs for this year (or maybe for the Next? nice wordplay, huh?) and should be checked out by every RNB fan."
4,It'll Do..,"I actually purchased this with the plan of using it as an in-tank refugium (salt-water tank), and it looks like it will be just fine for what I want it to do. In fact, with the way it sits in the tank, I might be tempted to start growing some Mangroves out of it as well. The one thing that kind of bugs me is the ""hooks"": they're nice because you can bend them to your tank rim, but they're a little short which doesn't leave much room for height/depth adjustability. Plus, the way the box attaches to the hooks (just sits on their via slots on the back), isn't all that secure; especially since the box floats a tiny bit with the current. So if the manufacturer provided a rigid box-to-hook connection and gave anywhere from 3-6 inches more length for the hooks (would also allow me to create extra bends, which would also allow the box to sit flatter against the glass...hopefully), I would give this 5 stars, but currently, I'll stick with my slightly generous 4 star rating."
1,Can't See The Display and Too Many Commercials,"The Delphi SA10000 XM SKYFi Radio Receiver is not up to my expectations. I wanted to be able to see the display. This display is terrible. I wanted uninterrupted music and was very disappointed in the FM like commercials. I have returned my unit and received a refund with no problems.After my experience with this product and the XM/FM like commercials, I thought I would never get another satellite radio. A friend of mine told me about Sirius and its commercial free music. I tried their programming online for free and was impressed by the content and NO COMMERCIALS!! I will be buying Sirius' new Streamer plug and play next week."
4,"Lamp works great, packaging from manufacturer needs work","The product is as stated. Very sturdy, metal construction. Most important, the clamp is very strong. The only problem is that the lamp had two small dings. Nothing I would send the lamp back for but an issue that seems to have come up in a few other comments. The manufacturer is sending the lamps in a box basically loose. The lamp is folded over and covered in a plastic bag. The plastic bag is not sufficient enough as a buffer and the lamp shade comes in contact with the lamp arm. This can cause the dings. Aside from the packaging, tip top product. Way better than the less expensive +/- $20 models."
4,"Great lamp, poor switch","This is a traditional architect's lamp. It is very nicely made. The 45"" reach is real and useful. It clamps securely and all the parts swivel nicely. It stays put.After about a month, the switch, a simple rotary switch, started getting harder and harder to turn. Finally, it took pliers to move it, and finally it failed completely. I contacted Electrix and they sent out a replacement.We again have a delightful; no play on words; lamp.Bob"
1,Compatability issues,I knew about the HDCP issue - and knew that my tv a Philips 60 inch hd could support it. Got the expensive dvi cable - and still had snow. Oh well so much for product testing! Back to the store tomorrow. Guess they are still working out the definitions of dvi standards. Its the only way I could explain it. I am disappointed.
2,BE WARNED ::: This Isnt TRUE HDTV!!!,"Alot of hype has been surrounding this product since it is one of the first ""HD"" DVD players on the market. BE CAREFUL, this is not actually a High-Definition DVD player.All this does is take your current DVDs, which have a resolution of 480 scan lines, and enlarge the picture to 1080 scan lines. THAT's ALL!!! This DVD player does not add any extra detail to the picture or make it any sharper. Anybody who tells you otherwise is imagining things. Garbage in, garbage out.It's almost false advertising to call this a HD DVD player because when HD DVDs hit the market in 2 or 3 years, this player will not be compatible with any of them.As for a standard DVD player, I'm sure it's quite good - probably as good as most other DVD players, only this one is triple the price!"
2,Somewhat Confusing Methodology and Order of Progression,"No doubt about it - the graphics and picutures in CHESS FOR KIDS are excellent. This is what I consider to be the good points of the book, now on to the weaknesses,The weaknesses are:The order in which the material is given needs some improving. This is not the exact order that a kid (or an adult) should be taught. This creates a degree of confusion.The level of reading is not well suited for young kids to learn from, andSome of the ways that things are explained, such as in the rules and certain aspects of strategies could use some improvement."
5,That's the Truth,I've been listening to Paul since he released his first CD in Canada...and with every CD he just keeps getting better...That's the Truth has songs that will get you dancing and songs that will bring a tear to your eye...I give it 2 thumbs WAY up.
1,No Information Just Full of Malice,"I was expecting an interesting book that would educate me on this island before I traveled there. What I read was a dreadful book full of hatred and malice. If you are looking for information, go elsewhere. If you are looking for a book filled with anglican hatred, you have found yourself a gem!"
5,A part of Antigua you might not otherwise see,"I bought this book for a college class that I'm sailing through the Caribbean for. This is probably one of the best books I've read in a while. Kincaid's sarcasm and wit make this a fun read, and his poetic style enhances the text further. This work is a quick read, and I would recommend it to anyone who is interested in Antigua or the Caribbean in general."
5,Clear picture at an affordable price.,"Save thousands and go for Japanese products instead of Austrian/German products, the quality difference is very small."
5,Wonderful ottoman,This chair and ottoman set is so comfortable! Makes it easy to do night or day feedings. Is the only thing I could comfortably sleep on at 8 months pregnant. And the chair is so stylish and cute!
3,Great idea... poorly made,"I too remember this game from childhood, and remember it working much better. I purchased this for my daughters 3rd birthday thinking she and her older brother (4 1/2) could have a game they could play without too much adult help. The problem is that the (...) heads dont flip up well to eat the marlbes, the necks stick making them not work, and sometimes the hippos spit out marbles they have eaten. On top of all this if there aren't four players the game fails to work properly and all the little marbles cluster by the hippo not in use out of reach of the other ""hungry"" hippos. Even when we played with 3 people I kept having to reach in and make the marbles move out of that area so they would be reachable by the other hippos. Overall I am not impressed and would not have purchased the product had I known then what I know now. (...)"
3,No way to store it!,My kids 4 and 6 got this game for the holidays. Although they love playing with it the pieces come apart from the game constantly. Also since the box is so small it is very difficult to store. We like to keep all of our games neat and together and this one is impossible to keep track of. I will have to buy a storage container just to keep track of the pieces. I think the milton bradley really goofed on this one!
2,Piece of Junk,The plastic is flimsy. When my kids tried to get the marbles the hippos' heads would get stuck. With all four kids going for the marbles the game looked like it was ready to break. I wish this game was made the same way it was when I was a kid. I'd pay a lot of money for a good hungry hungry hippos game. This one just doesn't compare to the ones they used to make.
1,Too bad it's made in China!,"Remember when us Americans used to be upset and would complain about the things that were made in Taiwan? Bet you never thought you'd see the day when you would wish things were made in Taiwan again? This is a very poor attempt to resurrect a classic fun game that gave me, my siblings and friends hours of entertainment. First, the hippos and the board are no longer one piece. so in the heat of ""eating"" a hippo might pop off, play has to stop so that the player can reattach the hippo and start up again. That would be fine if it happens once a game. But after the 3rd or 4th time, kids lose interest and will just stop playing it. Try to find an original game board with the hippos fixed in place. It was more sturdy and you'll be much happier."
1,This piece of junk should come with a free garbage bag!,"1. Plastic ""marbles"" are too light. They fly way too high and sometimes off the playing field. They also get stuck inside the hippos at times.2. The hippos frequently get stuck in ""locked"" position during play rendering them useless. Since they're the key to the game, that's kind of a big deal.3. Sometimes the hippos fall apart while playing. Not really what you want to happen.I loved this game as a child. The current version is worthless. Don't get this unless you love frustration and children crying ""it's stuck! it's stuck again!"" over and over."
2,UGH!,"I have to agree with most other reviewers in how cheaply this toy was made. Big disappointment! The biggest gripe is that you have to take the darned thing apart to store it each time. Are they kidding me? With the money they saved on the cheap plastic, they could have spent on making the cardboard box a little bigger to throw the thing into after the kids are done playing it. Like another reviewer wrote, get an older model on eBay or at a thrift store, you'll save a lot on all the aggrivation you'd get from this new one!"
1,Extremely poor quality,"I was excited to buy this for my kids since I enjoyed it as a kid, but they sure don't make 'em like they used to. This really is the most flimsy, cheap plastic game I have ever seen; and the hippos stick frequently. If I would have tried it first, I never would have purchaed this and I'll keep this in mind for future purchases.I'm not a frequent reviewer so something has to be really great or really crappy. I didn't even buy it at Amazon, I was browsing other games and saw it here and had to review it."
1,What happened to the Hippos?,"We recently purchased this game for our five year old's birthday. I remembered the game from my childhood and knew he would love it, too. It turns out that Milton Bradley has gone el cheapo on making this game. The game itself is very ugly and cheap looking, the balls are all white (the used to be orange or multi-colored), the pieces barely fit together enough to even play, the marbles get stuck in the hippos throat (which requires that you stop play to clear the hippo out), the hippos mouths don't open very wide, and they push-pedals constantly stick in the middle of game play. The box that the game comes in is also very, very thin and flimsy - which is a real problem with a game that is comparatively heavy. We had to duct-tape the box before putting it away after the very first play!I would never, ever recommend this game to be purchased by anyone. I just don't understand it. What happened to the Hippos?"
2,Not as good as the old one...,definitely not as sturdy as the one i had when i was a kid. this one broke as we were putting it away in the box after using it for the first time on christmas morning. it seems really cheap. think i'll give my old one to the kids instead since it's held up better than the new one.
1,What a let down,"This game is the worst. The hippos get stuck if you push with any kind of force, the game is a piece of plastic junk, and I wouldn't recommend this if I was being paid to."
3,Fun game but not well made,I loved hungry hippo growing up. We got it for my daughter and we played it and had fun. I am disapointed with the quality. The hippos pop off pretty easily.
5,VERY DISAPPOINTING!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!,"MOST DEFINATLY NOT THE GAME I GREW UP WITH!!!! THIS VERSION OF HUNGRY HIPPOS IS TERRIBLY DISAPPOINTING!!!! DON'T BUY IT!!! IT WILL NOT STAY TOGETHER FOR EVEN A FEW MINUTES OF PLAY!! THE ""MARBLES"" ARE CHEEP HOLLLOW PLASIC BALLS AND THE HIPPOS DISCONNECT FROM THE GAME WITH EVEN HIT. IF THEY AREN'T FALLING OFF THE GAME THEN THEY WILL STICK. WE HAVE NEVER BEEN ABLE TO PLAY A COMPLETE GAME (NOT EVEN PART OF A GAME) WITHOUT GIVING UP IN FRUSTRATION. (...)"
5,"Buy it, but not for the bonus tracks","This album is a masterpiece for anyone with both ears open to true beauty. Forget coolness--this ain't necessarily cool music. You may actually be embarrassed to tell others that you like ELO. But that's OK! Close the door, put on your headphones, and enjoy the rich guilty pleasures of A New World Record.That being said, I was expecting a lot more from the bonus tracks. They're moderately interesting, but mostly amount to little more than the same tracks with the vocals subtracted. Granted, the way these great tunes were arranged is magical, but you can hear that with the vocals anyway. Where are the alternate mixes?I have my doubts about ""Surrender"", the only unreleased track from the album. This sounds like it's been processed quite a bit in the studio; doesn't sound like 1976 to me. Not a standout track anyway.Sound quality: great.No home should be complete without it."
4,A New World Record,"A New World Record being ELO's 6th studio album and their 1976 release and is a great mix of rock and art rock. The album did well with the critics and the public at large. It reached top ten both on the Billboard 200 and the UK Albums Chart. Allmusic and Roliing Stone both gave it favourable reviews. All the lyrics are included and we also get a list of whom plays what and in this list they have listed what brand of instruments they have used during the recording which is quite interesting. We also get a photograph of the band from the time of the release of the album. Tracks that I especially like on this record are ""Telephone Line"", ""So Fine"" and ""Livin' Thing"". 4/5."
5,One of the most perfect pop recordings ever made!,"I won't repeat what others have said already, except to add that this album means as much to me at 41 as it did when I was 16 - possibly even more. Not only is it ELO's finest album, it is one of the most pleasurable recordings ever made in any genre - and I say that as someone whose listening tastes are dominated by classical music and jazz. One suggestion: could Sony do a new digital remastering of this (and ""Out of the Blue"")? The current release, albeit at a budget price, feels a little spartan, and this album merits so much more!"
3,handheld Yahtzee,"I bought this toy as a gift through Amazon. I did not receive it in time for Christmas. When I did receive it, it did not work. I bought new batteries for it, but it still did not work. I returned it to the seller but I have not heard if credit was applied to my account or not."
3,Fun game,This Yahtzee is a great game but didn't last very long. But then again I guess Mom shouldn't drop in the tub :)
5,A fun distraction you can take anywhere,"The electronic version of Yahtzee is truly addicting. It's more fast-paced than the traditional version and can be played like Solitaire, only there's no cheating! The size makes it easily portable...great for the beach, a subway ride, or sitting in a doctor's office. The sound can become annoying to people around you so there's a mute feature so you can hide your addiction. Great value and endless hours of fun."
2,Very Disappointed,"I am very disapppointed with the performance of this electronic game. It was a little pricy to begin with for an electronic hand-held game and seems to be malfunctioning pretty often (I purchased it ""brand new"" about a month ago). I will be in the middle of a game & the system will clear itself completely & erase all of the points I have racked up. Needless to say it is quite frustrating. I replaced the battery on the mechanism, as I thought that may have been the problem, however it continues to malfunction. My suggestion would be to not purchase this item. Sincerely, Very Disappointed."
1,AMAZON IS DECIEVING!!!,"The picture shows the nice gold model. What I recieved wasn't even close to that! I got some white cheap model! Amazon is refunding my money, but be careful when you buy!!!"
3,Fair,"It definitely has a problem with a sudden ""blobbing"" of the print but it is better than none at all when you need one."
1,It doesn't work for me,I have been unable to upgrade my Excel 98 1 version with this product. I hope I can somehow either get it to work or else get back my money.
2,Lopsided,"I bought this cup to allow my baby boy drink some juice. I liked the soft ""spout"" feature and figured it would be easier on his gums, but the handles won't line up correctly with the spout. It is too hard for him to hold the handle at the bottom and top of the cup when he is trying to drink, so we just don't use it. Also, it arrived in pink, I wasn't given a color choice, but I wouldn'thave chosen pink for a boy!"
2,Poor quality plastic,I gave this product 2 stars because on the bottom of the cups the plastic cracks and leaks milk/juice. The handles come off the bottom easy and when done enough it cracks the plastic. I had them only for a month and they started leaking. Other wise they are really cute cups and I like the rubber sippy.
1,Nuby sippy cup,this cup is the worst. they promise you something that is not true.it is frustrating. it always leak and I have to hold the cup under my daughter chin with a towel so she does not get all wet.
1,This cup leaks horribly!,I bought this cup for my son as we were transitioning from bottle to sippy cup. I thought it was me not lining the bottle up correctly with the lid but after reading all of these reviews these are just horribly made sippy cups. They leak all over the place. Definetly do not waste your money!
1,CONTAIN BPA in handles!,The handles on this thing are BPA (illegal in Canada). I have no idea why it's in the Amazon BPA-free store.
2,Replacement spouts hard to find,"I like this cup however I don't like the spout. My toddler bites on it and then breaks the seal over time. I have yet to be able to find any replacement spouts in the stores. I have been to Babies R Us, Baby Depot, Target, etc. and no replacement spouts for the wide cups. They do have them at Babies R Us only for the regular size cups (no handle grip). Once the spout is broken, they are worthless. I would recommend getting the small mouth spout. The new redesign is more durable to biting as well. He has yet to break the seal on any of those. These are VERY easy to clean."
3,Ok trainer cup,"The handles are useless, you can't line up the spout. The bigger cup has the handles built into the lid, which is a much better idea. Still, without the handles (you can snap them off and on), it stores nicely, and 7 ounce size is plenty big enough. The soft spout let my son bite the milk out like he did on his bottle and is working well now that he's starting to suck better. Good transition from bottle for him. Ours might leak a drop or so when he puts it down, but I think that's waht he sucked out but is still in the recessed part, so amount leaked is very limited.If you want/need the handles, this cup is not for you. Still, the bigger cup with handles built in is harder to store, so this works well for me. He's used to tipping his bottle, so doesn't need handles anyway."
1,A poor choice,"The case is large, and bulky. It is not easy to access the camera, and the case changes how the camera is handled when attached to the camera. Opening the case involves undoing two snaps and a strip of velcro, and then wrangling the camera out of the ""black hole"" of the case. It is difficult and slow to unscrew the base of the case from the tripod mount. I returned it as quickly as possible."
2,Not impressed,"We are a family that loves games! This game appears to be educational, but has NOT been fun to play. The little tiles aren't easy to deal with, and the cheap plastic set-up leaves much to be desired. Save your money and play hangman on the chalk board."
3,A Very Original Action Film!,"I titled my review, ""A Very Original Action Film"" because I've never seen a movie like this one. There is always a movie about the Vietnam war, or a cops & robbers flick, which I do like those kind of films, I'm simply just proving a point. Besides the Rambo series being my favorite line of films, 'Escape from New York' is one of my other favorite action films.This story is very original...Well, there are films about escaping from prison, but this one had a guy rescuing the president from the prison.If you haven't seen this film, then rent it. If you like it, then buy it. Because this film will guaranteed to leave you satisfied."
3,Very disappointing,"While showcasing the best picture for the film yet, the Blu-Ray version of the film lacks everything else. No extras at all, no commentaries, no comic... If you are a videophile, this is the best version, but if you love this film you need the DVD collector's edition."
1,A new transfer on the way!,"DVD and John Carpenter fans (of which I consider myself both) - a new transfer ""Special Edition"" DVD of ""Escape From New York"" is due this fall, or at the latest, by early 2002. Refrain from buying this release; as one who owns Image's terrific 1996 laserdisc release of the film (with great commentary from both Carpenter and Kurt Russell), I can tell you that this DVD release by MGM is terrible in its quality. Whatever aged master elements they struck the print from are NOT what Image used. This transfer is terrible... hold onto your wallets and wait for the new release."
4,Blu-Ray Aspect Ratio,"The original aspect ratio of this film is 2.35, just as the 2003 Special Edition. This blu-ray lists the ratio as 1.85. Is this a typo, or has the blu-ray been released with the incorrect ratio ? Anybody ?"
4,In 1988 the world goes to hell and NYC is a one-way prison,"Look, for $12-$15 you get a perfectly adequate DVD transfer that looks very clear and boasts good DVD quality sound to boot, for it's age. I have no real complaints, considering the price, about the DVD itself.For the average DVD owner/watcher Carpenter's ""Escape From New York"" is a classic dark, sci-fi action adventure story starring Kurt Russell before he went soft, co-starring in bad Goldie Hawn movies.Besides some of the cheesiness which is obvious, (""Snake"" is Russell's character name) the story is very compelling and the suspense is believeable and effective.The dark, corrupt, sinister overtone of the film is delivered brilliantly for it's time, and on a grand scale involving Manhattan Island and a post-apocalyptic New York City.For half the price of most DVD's, this one is worth buying and watching more than once."
5,Look for to the SE,"I'm a fan of all Carpenter's film, my favorite without a doubt is Escape From New York, I didn't really care much for LA, but it was still ok. Anyway, the Special Features for the new Escape From New York DVD look good. Escape from New York was way ahead of its time when it first came out & Snake Plissken is probably one of the most dynamic character is modern fiction. It's a great film and I'm sure this new DVD is gonna make the film even better to watch."
3,Just call me snake...,Love this classic movie and the price was right but after a couple of viewings I remember why I didn't keep the first video I had.
3,Decent to Pretty Good,"This is a pretty good album. The only thing I would have liked is if the music was not so repetative. On most of the songs, it is the same drum synthersizer playing. Her voice is now a strong and confident contralto that is quite arresting. Lyrically some of the songs are slightly chilced, however Peggy's unique personality makes you ignore that albums' shortcomings. The best songs are ""That's How I Do It"", ""Mommy's No Dummy"" and ""Your Too Freaky for Me"". This album is recommended to people that are already fans of her work. Novices would do best be getting her other albums, ""Help Yourself"", ""Contagious"", ""Hot & Sassy"" and her live album."
5,A must have. Easy to set-up.,"Maybe they have changed things since the earlier reviews, but I founf the wireless networking easy to set-up. This system is incredible. Everything about it is good, and I recommend it to anyone with a large music collection on their computer. I don't think I could live without it now."
3,Fallacious Assumptions,"I can tell that the basic premise of this book is falacious and based on Catholic biases. It argues that the Protestant Ethic and the belief in producing more and more has caused us to work longer and harder and caused us to lose our souls because we lack leisure time for contemplation. This is factually wrong because we work much less than people use to have to work and this is due to being able to produce more in less time. Traditonally, leisure has been seen as the root of sin and pleasure because it is hard to gratify pleasure when one is working. In fact, the ancient Greeks and Romans did not enjoy much leisure until they began to use more and more slaves to support themselves. The truth is that we have more leisure than any generation has ever enjoyed and use it more selfishly and ignorantly than ever. The problem is not a lack of time, but how we spend it."
4,Great country music,"David Ball is one of the few country singers singing REAL country music. Virtually every other so-called country singer pales next to him. This is a very good CD, although it can't compare to THINKING PROBLEM, the greatest honky tonk CD of the 90s."
1,Useless,"What a disappointment. These don't work in 1/2 of the range advertised, and they eat 6 ""AA"" batteries in less than 2 hours (not constant talk time). Even with rechargables, the incredibly low battery life makes them useless."
1,More D-Link Problems,"I decided to get the DWL-AG530 a couple of months ago to work with the DI-784 AP. The DI-784 is experiencing all the problems that other reviewers have reported.This morning the 2.4 GHZ radio died in the DWL-AG530. The ""A"" side still works, but nothing on ""B/G"".I don't think I will try any more D-Link equipment!"
1,Potential but curdled,"Cytosport Muscle Milk High Protein Shake, Banana Creme, 17-Ounce Cartons (Pack of 12)Lots of potential but -- had tried the chocolate, very good. Ordered 2 more cases -- both are curdled and lumpy. The lumps will not go back into solution. Probably not dangerous but definelty not appealing. Amazon should get out of foods if they can't deliver the good."
3,"Asteroids colliding with Earth, Big Foot and Ancient astronauts","The English-American astronaut Nigel prevents an asteroid from colliding with Earth, but finds is is a hollow space ship. This leads to a plot aboutrampaging AI robots, ancient astronauts and big foot.The plot has more sex than most adventure science fictionand talks about evolution in a pretty ignorant manner.The use of drugs and stream of consciousness techniques add some spice to a nearly limp plot. NASA takes a deserved beating in the plot as beingmore political than scientific."
4,The beginning of a great series,"Together with Across the Sea of Suns, this introduces the key elements that lead to events in the Galactic Centre series, set thousands of years further in the future. It's a great book, and the sober protagonist Nigel Walmsley is an excellent character. Mysterious, sinister and imaginative; well worth a read."
3,Good for three quarters,"This is the first Clannad album I bought, so the complaints of some of the other reviewers (that it had too much material already available elsewhere) didn't really bother me.When I like Clannad, I really like Clannad. When I don't like them, I really don't like them. On this package, I really liked about three quarters of the music and really did not like the other quarter.The stuff they've done with traditional Celtic and Gaelic music is great. I could listen to songs like the Theme From ""Harry's Game"", Nil Se Ina La, Caislean Oir and The Poison Glen a thousand times and still enjoy each one.However, the new age-y 80s and 90s stuff like Sirius seems horribly dated.That aside, if you don't have any Clannad albums and you like some of their stuff, this might be a good place to start."
3,Connecter Fennecter,"It's pretty fun but, you can get bored. It's sliding in pieces and trying to get four it a row. It's a great time passer but when it comes to fun, then I'm not so sure. Keep away from this toy. I have it. Now it's sitting in a dusty corner in my closet."
1,Vertical Tic-Tac-Toe,"This game is fun for three-year-olds, who just like to practice putting the checkers in the slots. I suppose it teaches a certain manual dexterity.There comes a point in the life of a Tic-Tac-Toe player when he or she figures out that it's impossible to lose. After that, the game is no longer any fun. For me, the same is true of this game.We must have one of the sturdier versions of the game. My daughter played this game as a child, and now her son is playing with the same one. No parts have broken, and the slide stays where it belongs."
3,Palm m515,"Excellent value for the money but couldn;t get it to work with Windows 7. The tech support people at Renew Electronics were very helpful. When we finally dedided to give up trrying to make it work, they were very prompt in givving me a full refund. I would buy from them again. I eventually bought a Palm TX aand it works with Windows 7."
2,Very frustrated....,"I have a Palm V and it worked great, but I wanted to upgrade to a color palm. At first this worked well too, but then I noticed the palm battery would drain after a couple of days and very little usage.Now, I'm out running errands and making appointments, I try to use my palm and it won't turn on. I think the battery is dead but when I put it in the charger it shows the battery is only 1/2 used.I like the color, but the inconsistency as to when it ""feels like working"" is too inconvenient.Very frustrating....."
3,Poor Service,"This item is a wonderful tool to organize my life. I can't function without it, I like it so much. Precisely why I had to give it a 3 star rating. It can't seem to hold a charge reliably. When the battery reads nearly full one minute, an hour later I have lost all power and data, necessitating a hard reset. Palm will not stand behind this defect, because it was an ""open box item."" They will sell me a new model for over $200, but the m515 is not available except as ""refurbished."" I don't dare go that route again and recommend that others not buy open box items. They claim to have been thoroughly checked before resale, but I believe either my switch or my battery is defective. Because I like the model so well I am still trying to locate a ""new"" one on other websites that might be affordable.Advice: Buy new and back up often on hotsynch.Don't rely on Palm."
1,Palm One m515 disaster,"Worked great for about a week... hasn't worked properly since then... a true classic piece of junk!Product won't turn on unless you use the stylus to push the ""reset"" button... then, in the middle of booting up.. it crashes with a ""fatal error""..!!Based upon this experience... this is my last purchase from Amazon!"
2,"good OS, bad product","Palm OS is great, I used to have a sony palm, great product. This one I ordered doesn't have the same quality. If you tap on the screen, the accuracy is not there at all. My mistake is that I cut the UPC code too early and can't return this item any more."
1,Lousy Product Lousy Comany Lousy Service,"Unit is 6 weeks old and hardware malfunctions if it gets below 40 degrees, say, waiting for a bus! Has done this 4 times. Erases all data. Have to reformat entire unit! Palm customer service refused to give me the ""advance replacement"" warranty option advertised on website (you pay [$$$] and get a replacement immediately instead of waiting for repair). Said no units were available, even though their online store said if I was buying new I'd get one in 2 days. Of course, they have my money, what do they care? Dishonest advertising! This warranty feature was one of the reasons I went with Palm. Corporate office ""customer elevation"" personnel rude and admitted warranty data on web is out of date and said they ""couldn't be expected"" to keep it current. Honest, that is what she said! Will never buy from Palm again. Neither should you. Bought from Amazon, though, and Amazon was great., shipped fast!"
5,Great little device,"This is a great little device for organizing dates and addresses and phone numbers. I am a middle-aged mother of 3, daughter of one, and wife of one, who keeps calendars for EVERYBODY. I even store my octogenerian mother's lists of medications and her extensive medical records in my PDA. Every time I take her to a doctor, I need to recall her other 5 doctors' addresses and all of her medical history. I don't know how I survived all these years without a PDA!I needed a dependable PDA without bell's and whistles, but in color so I can CATEGORIZE which I love to do, and a PDA that is compatible with OS X on the Mac. It's great to go back and forth between the Mac and the PDA and be able to synchronize.I am very happy with the Palm 515, but I haven't tried anything else, so I can't really compare. Worth the $$$$? Probably not - but certainly helps simplify my already hectic life."
1,The palm m515 needs much work,After having 3 other palms I invested in the M515 which was my first mistake. I had used my other palms to no end and they are definately one of the better products out there. However; when investing this much money on a PDA you would think that they would improve upon their product not come up with new bugs. Keeping this palm in my breast pocket turns the unit on constantly. My oldr palms had never turned themselves on. The batteries drain when using the palm for long periods of time and when connecting to my desktop the unit freezes during data transfer each time. Getting tech support from palm has also been a challenge. After three months with the above issues I am still waiting for solutions to my problems. If you are set in getting a palm I recommend their lower end units which work better and give their users less trouble. When I had My IIIx & IIIc I had no problems with the units whatsoever
1,Rip Off!,"I did not buy this particular model, but the Hybrid. But I am responding under this heading to let you know they have crummy customer service. The first week I loved the chair and made a mistake of leaving a five star opinion on their website. Within one week the webbing came out of the chair. There is no way you can get it back in the slot. One week later the chair collapsed on one side where the screws had either come loose or did not have a nut on them to begin with. I can't get the seat pin back in so the chair now sits in the garage - I can't afford to send it back . Now mind you I weigh 100 pounds so I find this absolutely ridiculous considering how much I spent for it. But the real clincher is that I called twice where you get a recording assuring you they will promptly return your call. Didn't happen - so I emailed them and still no response.I find it interesting they only have positive opinions on their website."
1,too bad...,"i saw these guys with Home Grown, and was very impressed, i bought there cd right away, (the old school album, on Drive Thru Records, when they were still River Fenix) and let me tell you, that is an amazing cd, all the songs are great. ANYWAY, then they left drive thru, joined MCA, re-recorded tracks to put on this album,and its total trash, they even took off Skinhead Jesse, and the Death Metal songs, that ruined it too, if you have a chance to get or listen to the old school RF cd, listen to it, its alot better"
4,Excuse me? (4.6 stars),"Ok. I stumbled across this on Amazon.com. Cause everyone was saying how it sounded sooooooo much like Blink182. I noticed that most of the reviews were written around the Enema of The State time period. SO I assumed they were talking about Enema. SO, I went out and bought it (note that I could have bought Nofx's Punk in Drublic CD instead). I discovered that this sounded NOTHING like Blink182! If I had to say what band is the most similar to this it would have to be MxPx. NOT BLINK182. There is only one band that you can say sounds just like Blink. That is Sum41. No other band. If you buy this CD excepting it to sound just like Blink182 you are going to be disappointed, juts like I originally was."
3,Its ok...,"I think its just a copy off of Blink 182 and they don't have an original style or sound. If you really like punk get it, but if your tired of hearing the same stuff over and over spend your money on something a little more original."
3,i would give it 3 and a half,"They're good. They're good and I somewhat like it. They have good potential, but what did we say about blink-182? (who I believe hasn't sold out YET, but will). They sound good, it's catchy, and if you like blink you should buy this. What's better than this is MxPx...if you enjoy this, buy ""Life in General"" by MxPx (so much better). Fenix Tx is a nice addition to the pop-punk genre. But be ready in at most 5 years to not like them and enjoy greatly ""the early stuff"", how it is with blink now. Bands to check out (with good songs in parentheses) if you like this stuff: as I earlier, MxPx (chickmagnet, the downfall of western civilization), millencolin (bullion), goldfinger (99 red balloons, san simeon, superman [more of a ska sound]). Good stuff, worth your money to a certain extent."
5,Every punk fan should own this cd!,"I don't really understand why everyone has to compare new bands to other established bands. Sure, Fenix Tx sounds a lot like Blink 182, but does that make them sound any less awesome? 3 Doors Down sounds a lot like Creed, but that doesn't mean I can't like them more. I personally think that Fenix Tx has a lot more talent than the guys of Blink, and my only problem with this cd is that it isn't long enough. If you like less known punk bands like the Ataris and Less than Jake, go out and buy this cd, because it rocks the whole way through. It's been in my cd player for months now and it never gets old!"
5,Stronger than Lipton,I bought this tea for my husband and he loves it. We make tea by the pitcher and with Lipton we needed 4 bags but with Twinings we only use 3 so it's more economical with a better flavor.This is a great buy for anyone looking for the benifits of green tea without the caffine.
5,chanur's homecoming/gift for son,"My son loves it.I received it very quickly. son says it's a 5 and then some. I'll probly will read it some day. he has the series, so if he is happy withit I am happy."
3,Good but looking for better,"This product is not bad. I saw a little improvement on my dark circle and puffiness, and it seems moisturizing. But I don't have any wrinkles, so I can't tell if it you help or not. I'm just looking for a product which will considerably improve my dark circle.For the texture, it's okay. A little bit too thick but it goes quickly into your skin. Even the blue color doesn't last long at all. But something a little bit lighter would probably be better."
4,Very Informative for the HD Collector,This book is one of the best written for the Harley Davidson Collector. Well written and illistrated. Highly recommend.
5,Gave it as a gift to a 10 year old girl,"The 10-year old daughter of a friend sent me back this feedback about this book: I love it so much. It taught me how to be unselfish, and to be loving and kind.I sent this book as a gift to my friend's little girl for her birthday. She is a smart little girl who likes to read and realy appreciated the book."
2,Doesn't work for bike air suspension.,I bought this to use with my Bontrager air shock pump. It still allows air to escape upon removal. Waste of money for bicycle air shock inflation.
1,not happy,"I bought one of the Topeak connecter that, for me does not work. I'm not saying they all don't work JUST THE ONE I GOT. I use it on 2 different bicycles, my SUV and the neighbors yard tractor. IT didn't let air through in to the tire being serviced."
4,Essential classic,"Essential book for off shore sailing skills and knowledge. This is also a required reading for the ASA108 certification level. The book has been revised several times and you want to make sure you order the latest edition. Nothing spectacular, just a solid book on heavy weather sailing. Good to own, but you will not find yourself picking it up over and over again... ."
1,Never received it.,"I ordered this subscription 3 months ago, I won't need it soon and I have no idea if it will ever show up..."
1,So not worth it,"Subscription service assistants for this magazine are pathetic. I paid for my subscription when I submitted my order, yet they suspended my account while ""waiting for payment"". They have yet to deliver my first issue, and I'm sure I won't even need it by then. There are better magazines out there, and this one isn't one of them. I recommend saving your time and money and avoiding Shape's FitPregnancy."
2,Mediocre,"This book is heavily padded with pretend conversations between imaginary church ladies, and has the worst illustrations imaginable. However, once you have sifted through the outdated statistics, there are a few nuggets of wisdom. These include a caution against making every woman at your church ""automatically"" a member of a particular women's group, and instructions on how to schedule meetings and increase accountability and organization"
2,Not up to Par,"I purchased Elixir strings after hearing them repeatedly recommended at the music store. Put them on my Eko Ranger XII acoustic 12 string. Have 2 problems with the strings. First, the bass E (11th string) broke while tuning it up. Had to go to music store and buy a single replacement string (not Elixir). I have changed strings many, many times, so I am convinced it was not my stringing, but a weakness in the E string itself. Second, the high D (8th string) seems ""dead""; it does not ""ring"" as it should and as the other high strings do (though none as much as other 12 string sets I've used). Considering these strings cost much more than others, I certainly am disappointed in them. Hardly matters if they last longer if they don't sound as good."
5,love Elixir nanoweb,"I have been using Elixir Nanoweb strings for almost two years, and won't buy anything else. What they say about long string life is absolutely true. With other strings, I needed to change them after any gig or jam session that went more than a couple hours. If I didn't, the strings sounded really, really dead. I used to change strings at least weekly, and sometimes more often.When I play Elixir strings, they sound great when I put them on, and they still sound pretty good when I change them 3-4 months later."
3,Easy to play but has an artificial sound,"It's a joy to play on these strings. The soft coating lasts very long and they don't get dirty as quickly as the other strings that I have owned. You can painlessly slide your fingers up and down the neck as much as you like. However, the sound doesn't have enough presence. I have a Yamaha FG-series acoustic guitar which sounds absolutely amazing, but with these strings it sounds a bit more like an electric guitar. High notes sounds okay, but notes on the low E, A, and D strings don't have a warm and full sound. Good choice if you mainly play Pop with barre chords down the neck, but not for open chords and the dirty, slightly distorted blues sound you expect from an Acoustic guitar when you pick and slap those lower strings hard."
5,Love this Product,"I have tried other strings but none of them has the sound that the Elixir strings does on my guitar, and don't have to change them as often, been using this brand of strings for about 4 years and they hold up good. I play bluegrass and play pretty hard at times and have never broke a string I use a med. pick."
5,Light and durable,"I love the Elixir light nanoweb strings. They are light enough to bend and solo while keeping tune and never breaking. I used to buy Martin strings exclusively but they would always bust in the middle of heavy playing, which is a real pain, especially if you play live.These are some of the lightest acoustic strings on the market. I suggest picking up a pair and trying them out, what have you got to lose?Buy them from Amazon because they are $20+ in a store, that is IF they are sold at your local guitar store - they aren't in my Hollywood Guitar Center."
2,.053 mm string broke after changing the strings.,"Title says it all, kinda pissed off about it but owell, it was only 13 dollars but still 13 dollars wasted instead of being put towards better strings."
2,problem after 7 weeks of ownership,"Everything with this Palm has been great...until now. After owning for less than 2 months, the stylus works on one side of the screen and not the other. Calibration and hard reset will not work either. Since past the 30 day return time ..., we contacted Palm and were told that they were sending another to us. After we receive, we mail back our broken Palm and (Money). So much for the free shipping offer from our original order that was a graduation present for my husband."
2,Good for a year. Not dependable. Battery + screen problems.,My M130 will reset itself when I pull it in or out of the cradle or if I let it go uncharged over the weekend. I bought mine in May 2002 and it worked great for the first year but now I can't use the graffiti writing surface and the stylus calibration takes over 100 inputs before it finishes. A dictionary card will also reset my Palm. 2 stars for a year of good service.
5,"hello,seller!","dear,seller..i'm very interested for buying your item.but i've read that you can't ship it to indonesia.so,i beg you to ship this item to indonesia.and for the payment i'll give my credit card number so you can charge it.please reply me as soon as posibleRegard."
3,Now,"Before becoming the disgusting, sedentary blob I am now, I used to go down the gym and take bets with the guys as to when 'Girl Like You' would come over the speakers. It was way existential. ""Now"" - ""no, now."" And it would. It's on this CD. Not now. Now.The end song is annoyingly different to the tape version one and has the wrong track listings too. Both still have that long passage of silence before a totally un-anounced song arrives. Collins has a nerve slagging off the pretensions of some old duffer at a summer festival on the opening track when he's pseuding around like this on his own record."
3,Not for beginners,I bought the book because the reviews were positive. The bookhas a number of little errors and it takes a little experience to findthem (and to solve them).
1,reversed song using a computer,"The song is simply reversed by using computer software. Both the music and the voices are reversed.A piece of art goes through a process of creation; it is not a simple click using a computer as in this case.Anyone can reverse Mozart but the result is not an opera and author is just a person who plays with the computer.While the songs in Christian-orthodox can truly inspire and generate positive effects the ""reversed"" song in the movie just gave me creeps.I reversed the movie song using a software application and it is exactly a Romanian Christian-orthodox song and yes, I speak Romanian."
5,EWS Score:The Masked Ball & the Verse from the Bagavat Gita,"Kubrick movies have a thought provoking and recurring themes with regard to the sound track. For instance, the use of the Blue Danube Waltz in 2001: A Space Odyssey and Strangelove, or synthesisized versions of popular classics to set the mood in A Clockwork Orange. However, no mention has been made as to the reason why a popular Sanskrit verse from the Bagavat Gita serves as the musical backdrop for the Masked Ball/Orgy Scene in Eyes Wide Shut. Can anyone shed some light on this matter?"
5,Tired of rusty strings? no more!!,"i am an ocasional player, mostly at home, some gigs once in a while, and i used to suffer whenever i went a long time without playing my guitars because no matter how much i wiped them after playing they always become rusty and lose tone very fast.since i have elixirs on all my guitars i can go for months without changing strings with hardly any lose in tone and no rust at all!! it has changed my life for the better, if you gig or play ocassionally no other brand will last as long!!"
3,Didn't exactly live up to expectations,"I was really hoping this game would become something I would pop in and play with whenever i couldn't decide on what to play or when i just felt like some down time, but that just wasn't the case. Elecktroplankton just doesn't have enough to keep me A)coming back to play and B)keeping me play.All harshness out of the way I will say there are some really cool stuff to mess with. I have found myself a few times hooking the game up to my PC speakers and having it play really loud while doing homework. It does have that almost ""Nirvana"" thing about it. In the end of the day though the chance of you using this more than a handful of times will be very low.If you are really bugged out for a ""strange"" game look up ""Daigasso! Band Brothers"" or ""Ouendan"" otherwise known as ""Elite beat agents""."
2,Not for sensitive stomachs,"My dog LOVED this bone, but I should have known better. She had serious diarrhea for 10 days after one day with the bone. If your dog has a sensitive stomach (mine cannot tolerate rawhide or many other treats), beware."
5,Like all the others here who rated this high,Great little table cooker - easy to clean and well built
2,smokeless? ...you people are insane,"to everyone who chimed in on how great smokeless this grill is.. what are you people on? SERIOUSLY.. what is your definition of smokeless.. or hell, how do you use this grill that it becomes smokeless? I gave it a first-run this weekend with some burgers and my kitchen got so smokey i had to use fans to blow the smoke out the window..purchased it on others claiming it to be smokeless and that wasn't anywhere near the caseis it a great grill? yea, it heats up quite nicely, leaves marks on the food, nice countertop space saving design, etc..it's a great grillbut smokeless? I'm rating this 2 stars when I would normally rate it 4 stars because that's how annoyed I am at people who wrote smokeless but the product couldn't be further from the truthwhat you people cooking on?! LOW?! .. smokeless.. -sigh-"
1,Too heavy for cleaning,"The grill plate is removable which should be easy for cleaning, but the weight of the grill plate is too heavy. It is very hard to hold and clean at the same time. I ordered the grill and returned it the next day. I hope the manufacturer will put the easiness of cleaning as a priority, then they will have a better product.I have one wonderful grill machine from Black & Decker that I bought several years ago. It is so easy to take out and clean. Unfortunately, Black & Decker did not continue the same model. The new Black & Decker model is of very cheap quality. The paint job is not even and the non-stick coating is also bad. I do not suggest people buy the new Black & Decker indoor grill machine."
3,zojirushi indoor grill,heats up fast but difficult to control temp and not able to cook meat throughly without burning outside. Maybe it takes awhile to get the hang of it but so far not overly impressed....
3,Not quite perfect,"I'm getting lots of use out of this grill, but it has two pretty large flaws. First, the handles are made out of thin plastic and I managed to crack one within the first few days. Second, the temperature control is VERY hard to insert and pull out. It needs a lot of jostling before it clicks all the way in.These two criticisms aside, the grill heats up quickly and evenly and works like a charm when it comes to cooking. I just wish the overall construction was a bit better."
5,Great product!,"Great product at a good price. The quality of this bipod is excellent. There is no other choice. Just spend the money and get a Harris. Great price, and fast shipping. I am very satisfied."
5,Excellent bipod,"I was wondering about fit for my Savage 12 BVSS rifle due to the wider forend. This bipod also fit my other two Savage rifles; 12 FVSS and 93 BTVS. Solid construction, just the right height for bench rest shooting and the notched legs make it easy to level the rifle. Changing the bipod from one rifle to another can be done in less than 5 minutes."
5,This is what,"This is what you will want to know when you lay dying. Certainly there are mistakes. Certainly there is want. Never has a man presented himself from ""Christians and Cannibals"" as to this end. Probably you won't like it. Certainly it's the best dying monologue written by western man. There's a beauty within. Beyond the usual Mailer-isms. Perhaps best perceived by those who followed the writings of Mailer. Beyond Hitler. I see it in those ants in my yard. Whom I've come to adore."
3,Mailer is slipping,"Novel is plodding, very hard to keep interested in subject. Had hoped for so much more from such an accomplished author."
3,This Castle Has MANY Rooms!,"By many rooms, I mean this novel is filled with shocking cruelty and gentleness, cruel abhorrence and love, sensuality and abominations, adultery and conviction. So many contradictions! To this reader, it is at once interesting and also unforgettably disgusting.This book is unusual in that it is narrated by the devil himself. But then, who could be a better biographer than him for Hitler? This novel is difficult to endure in its stark portrayal of evil at its utmost. In spite of this, the book is interesting, if you can take it."
1,Not the bang - the whimper!,"Norman! Norman! Norman! At the end of your wonderful literary output to go on about Adolf. It is all over - this is a new and much more terrible century. There is only one positive response to this miserable obsession -go straight out and buy a copy of The Deer Park, and savour again its poetry and its relish for life."
3,Slowwwww,"Perhaps I wasn't in the right mood, but I couldn't get into Mailer's book, which surprises me a lot.. I actually put it down at my 100 page mark ( give a book 100 pages and quit)."
3,Somewhat disa-boink-ing,"I love Equivel's best stuff, but except for the inspired ""White Christmas"", it isn't on this collection. I think he recorded ""White Christmas"", somebody said, ""Hey! Let's do a Christmas album; but we've only got a week to get it done"", and they did. Not bad, just not nearly as creative and one-of-a-kind as the best stuff on ""Planet"" and ""Bachelor Pad"""
4,Hard to find Decca Recordings,"Looking to fill in your Bing collection? Here are twenty hard to find original Decca recordings from 1938 to 1940 collected together. No big hits here -- just some fine pop recordings with John Scott Trotter and his orchestra. Overall, the sound is good to very good -- a fine transfer. This is worth looking for if you are a fan of Bing's 1930s recordings."
5,Hilarious Life Lessons from Jim Jamkins...,This quirky novel is a great read. Humor & satire infuse Jonathan Pierces Jim Jamkins Series Book 1: The Fringe Benefits of Converting a School bus into a Home. This talented young writer spins a charming and funny book of youth's misadventure. I look forward to reading more about Jim Jamkins!
2,"Awesome CD, but seek out the UK/Europe version","I am guessing they put the Nicole version of ""you are my miracle"", because of her association with PCD, hoping to reel in fans of theirs. Big mistake. The version with Katherine Jenkins. Also, WHY OH WHY did they remove his cover of ""If You're Not The One"", in Italian. On a plus, the rest of the cd is the same, and is mostly, incredible. Highlights include : Querida, Tu Se, Cosi (Keane's bedshaped). This guy is going places. Hopefully, here in the US."
1,Nothing special!,"In spite of some so-so reviews I ordered these sheets because I had an Amazon gift certificate I had to use for some purchase. When you see the words, Egyptian Cotton you have the expectation that the sheets will be soft and somewhat luxurious. Not true for these sheets. They smelled like chemical coming out of the package and had to be washed twice to get the smell out. They are very average. They are equivalent in softness and quality to any regular cotton sheets from a discount store. Save your money for the something special from another store."
1,Danco Tub Spout,"If you like leaks and wet walls, buy this product. What engineering genius designed this piece of junk? Water was diverter to the back of the spout and leaked between the back of the tub and the spout. Lots of potential for wall damage. I thought the diverter was designed to send the water up to the shower head. Another lesson in getting what you pay for."
3,NanoWeb stay clean but,"The Nanoweb strings do stay clean and they stand up but, on the negative side...I replaced one string in my set with a nanoweb and noticed right away the feel was slippery. When picking my fingers would slip on the nano string rather than pluck. I will stick to cleaning my good old standard strings."
3,"Good Acting, But Barely Watchable Film","I'll be honest, I bought this film because I loved Selma Blair in HELLBOY. I thought the acting in this particular piece of gen-X fluff was quite good. The characters were only mildly interesting, and the missing plot was kind of problematic, as I found myself yawning hugely throughout the majority of the sorry malange of cliches that substituted for the, aforementioned, absentee plot. The music was decent, however."
2,Didn't like it,"Sold them the next day I got them. Volume is low. I read in the manual something like ""Listening loud? NO! Loud music will damage your eardrums etc."" BUT I didn't like the fact that Sennheiser engineers would decide for me the maximum volume that is safe for me."
1,"Don't buy directly from Amazon, choose other sellers","I bought this item as a gift to someone in China. Upon receiving it, we found out that there was a scratch on the plastic casing(nope it was not metal) of left-side unit. It would be a huge hassle to return to it Amazon US and the waiting period for my credit refund could be up to 30 days.I paid the premium and chose Amazon, instead of other sellers (they were at least 20 bucks cheaper), to avoid getting a refurb item.Amazon gave me just that: A refurb (reconditioned) item, for the price of a brand new one.Very disappointing to say the least.P.S. I bought stuff from Amazon UK and Amazon China before, never experienced anything as bad as that."
3,Not for travelers/Little Noise Cancelling,"After a month of using this pair, i have decided to sell them. Since I'm a touring musician, I travel a lot. The carrying case is too big: the headphones are too bulksy and the cable kind of long. At least that would be fine if it's worth it, but the noise canceling is just OK. I hate to admit this, but compared to the commercial Bose NC headphones (i hate bose products because of their abuse of bass), the sennheiser pxc 450 fall short. This headphones don't cancel sounds like turbines or crying babies. They do sound great. I love their clarity. But for 400 dollars ¡come on! They are way too expensive. For the same money you can get sound isolating sure headphones which will not take up half of your hand-luggage space."
4,Sennheiser PXC 450 vs Bose QC15,Sennheiser PXC 450 vs Bose QC15The verdict Sennheiser PXC 450 are fun to listen to. I noticed nuances I have never heard before in my music and an overall I just liked listening to them. I did not have this experience with the Bose. The Bose sound decent but the clarity & fun was missing and I just didn't enjoy listening to them. I would force myself to listen to the numerous song with each. I was board with the Bose and wanted to listen to the Sennheiser every time. The Sennheiser simply sound better. FYI: I was in a relatively quite environment when I did my tests (this is where I will be doing most of my listening). I will be returning the Bose (still in my 30 day trial period).Sennheiser PXC 450Pros:-sound-by pass switch to run without battery powerCons:-bulky and heavy-not easy to wear glasses
2,Died after 20th use - am going back to Bose,"Bought them in Nov 2011. Worked great for long flights but did notice having to change the battery after every trip (only about 4 hours per battery). I originally had a Bose set and ""retired"" it and after reading the reviews, thought that the sound quality tradeoff (versus noise canceling) was worth it. I no longer thing so. Why pay such a premium for this product only to have it stop functioning after 7 months (about 20th uses). Now back to using my 15 year old Bose set again. Just mailed it back for the warranty work...we'll see. This doesn't inspire confidence in the product and adding insult to injury, I had to pay $10 in postage to return the product that simply stopped working. Sennheiser - I doubt very much I will purchase another from you and am very dissapointed in your product. Likely my mistake - German design but communist chinese manufacturing - should have known better."
2,Disappointment after PXC 350,"I am not a tech freak but do fly frequently and used to own a pair of Sennheiser PXC 350 to use on flights and was very pleased with them. However they recently were annexed by an unknown person on a KLM flight along with my MP3 player (you know who you are) so I needed a replacement. Since the PXC 350 is not made anymore I turned to the PXC 450 instead. The sound quality as well as the noise cancellation is way below the PXC 350. The volume control is integrated into the headphones and therefore difficult to reach vs the 350 where it was conveniently located on the cable. Calmer music (or watching a film where people whisper) is not satisfactory as the outside noise remains extremely high and the volume is very low even in highest setting with MP3 player and headphone. I absolutely cannot recommend these headphones, a clear step back from its predecessor."
4,Sennheiser PCX 450 headphones,"These are very well made headphones that deliver excellent sound and noise dampening. I had a pair of Bose QC-2's and to be truthful, I thought the sound was much better on those. I'll probably sell these and pick up some QC-15's."
5,Awesome!,"This product is an exceptional find at a great price. As with all things ""German"" a bit of time spent for familiarization with the features will pay you great dividends. The device allows a whole new dimension in listening pleasures, both in and out of planes. Really recommend it after six (6) months of use."
2,A Perverse But Somehow Fitting Title,A long bout with heroin left Jimmy Page in poor shape by the time recording commenced on this final Zeppelin outing. Here we see the first glimpses of Jimmy Page in his diluted form -- whose sparse sloppy style would garnish a few Firm records before reuniting with Plant for a few solo free discs. In his shoes steps John Paul Jones who substituted the dense string orchestrations of his Sixties production career with cheezy synths. The record plays OK until you are looking for a little of that Zeppelin muscle which is only hinted at in In The Evening.
2,Show me the money,"I was and am a huge Led Zeppelin fan. I looked forward to the release of this album more than any other album in my entire life. On first listen, I was disappointed; what happened?After several hundred listens, I am of the opinion that John Paul Jones (and perhaps Robert Plant) realized the gravy train was grinding to a halt, and that they had better get another album out before Page and Bonham grew entirely unable to create music. Hence the four album covers, etc.This is a pleasant enough album. But it nowhere approaches the high standard set by the band on their first six albums."
2,OUCH!,"I heard Led Zeppelin's 1979 album ""In Through the Out Door"" on a local radio station the other night, and boy was I was shocked by how poor this album is. They really should have quit back in '75. I can't believe how many Zep fans think this is good, boy, they've sure drunk the kool-aid!!!Anyway, then the radio station followed Zeppelin with Deep Purple's 1984 comeback album ""Perfect Strangers."" Now that's what I call good hard rock! I needed to wash that Synth-Zeppelin out of my brain and Purple did the trick. Perfect Strangers has better songs and much better musicianship. I got to hand it to Purple for having the guts to reform and deliver a strong album! Led Zeppelin were a shell of a band by 1979 and this record shows it.In Through the Out Door: 2 1/2 stars (Buyer beware)Perfect Strangers: 4 1/2 stars"
2,What a waste of money.,"This is one of the times I got ripped off. I had to pay $ 17 for this peice of junk. This album has too many synthesizers in it. The only good song on this album is In the evening. Even though I like Led Zeppelin a lot, this time they let me down. And for all those people who are thinking about buying this album, don't. It's just a waste of money."
1,WORST ALBUM OF ALL,"Many people said that this one is the low hours of ZEP, if you think this review is not enough helpfull, you dont need to answer it, OK? Thank you"
4,Robert Plant has GOT TO HAVE your love!,"You have to give Page credit for pushing the boundaries. The fellows were old and had long since fallen out of favor with the fickle music fans of the 1970's. But, at least it wasn't the 'Miss You' disco tripe Mick Jagger passed off as music.There isn't a one of you that hasn't leaped all over your bedroom, strumming your air guitar to the opening riff of 'In The Evening'.""Oh! OH! I need your love!"" Plant just let's it all hang out on this track, on 'I'm Gonna Crawl', and they funk it up with 'South Bound Suarez' a underrated gem.Is it the long overdue second coming of Led Zeppelin's first album ? No. But for their age, for 1979, it's a classic offering. And, it beats out anything the Stone's have offered up since 1985."
4,Their Swan Song on Swan Song records,"""In the Evening"" has a powerful, haunting beginning. But did Page forget to tune his guitar for this album? I don't care what anyone says, I love ""Carouselambra"". ""All My Love"" is unintentionally sad for many reasons; Robert Plant's son and Bonham both. Same for ""I'm Gonna Crawl"". I'm sick of ""Fool in the Rain"" and it reminds me of Elton John for some reason. ""Hot Dog""!"
3,Album Cover,"In Response to one person's review that he finally got to see what was under the brown paper bag. There were actually seven different album covers made for this one. One from the point of view of each of the people in the scene. Don't forget, the ability to color the inside sleeve when you rubbed it with a damp cloth or fingers. Sort of unique and something one might expect from Zeppelin since they often times had trouble coming to agreement with record execs and album covers. As for the music it was a JPJ record with help from RP with lyrics. You really only hear JP with In the Evening. Although there are a couple of places where JB really shines. It was, all together, not a group effort."
5,Great album,I bought this vinyl for one song: Fool In the Rain. I played the vinyl and of course listened to the song I particularly wanted and was amazed by the sound quality of all the tracks. This album sounds just as good if not better than my 2010 release albums. Plus the album as a whole was very good. Now I own the only Zeppelin album that my dad doesn't own.
2,Worst Led Ever,"I also wrote a review of how disappointed I was about Houses of the Holy, but when I listened to this album I was shocked. Nowhere to be found was and inkling of rock, guitar, or decent lyrics. It was like when Sabbath lost Ozzy minus Iommi's compensation in screaming guitar licks. If you think I don't know what I'm talking about, just check out my other review I mentioned above. If you like Zeppelin as they look in 1-4 then listen to a few songs of this album before you buy it, you might save a few bucks."
2,Purely forgettable.,"Despite the name, which sounds like another name for ..., there's no really good tracks. Every song has those pop keyboards and very, very little guitar. In The Evening and I'm Gonna Crawl is good, if not excellent songs, but 15% that is good dosen't make me like the whol thing. Just download Track 1 and 7 and you'll be fine."
3,good but not as good,"This really was the end of zeppelin. The whole album sounds as though they was trying to move with the times and although there are faint glmpses of zeppelin genious (all my love, in the evening) they really lost there former glory. The amount of synths used for a band famed for its amazing riffs is sign of this trail. Perhaps this was a last ditch attempt to move with the times but I would much prefer if they didnt. This would be an extroadinarily good album for anyone other than zeppelin, but other than that it merely isnt up to scratch. Still the CD design is cool. Page is still a god if only the remaining three could get in a studio today, with todays technology, who knows, and we all know jimmy page is up to it. Anyone thinking of buying this album buy the others first."
4,Great CD,"Although not the best of the Led Zeppelin albums, it is still has great music and shows the ability of this legendary band to make music no matter what style. Yes, this CD is different than previous albums, but the fact that they made great music in a different style says a lot about the band. People get so caught up about how it's not the same as their other albums... well, yea, because its not. It's new, it's different. So if you are looking for more of the same, buy another copy of ZOSO, but if you want some Zeppelin with a twist to it, buy this CD. It is a neccesary addition to any rock and roll music collection."
5,Amazing!,A couple of years ago my Sunday School teacher bought this for me. I had never really thought about it till recently. I just read it and I am amazed and inspired. This is a wonderful book! Every girl should read this! I recommend this to all my friends.
4,Our rice cooker,It does cook the rice the way I like it. This is the second Zojirushi rice cooker I purchased. So far it's great especially when we have parties. The latter was a 5 cups only. My wife loves it.
2,Lasted for one year,"We got the Zojirushi rice cooker from amazon a little over a year ago, and it made great rice for 13 months. After that it would switch to warm mode too soon, and all we got was water and undercooked rice every time. It made me wish we had not given our old rice maker to charity. It was 20 years old and still working."
3,I'm confused... my dyson came with this attachment!,"Many people said their main complaint was having to purchase this tool separate. for some reason, I didn't have to. My dyson came with one. I must say, i don't use it often though. I agree with the person that said it was tedious to have to attach to the wand in order to use it. and sometimes the suction is so hard, i can't get it to move around very easy. but i do have a lot of hard floor surfaces and low profile furniture, so it is useful to get under all that stuff, once you get used to having to rotate the handle on the wand that you must attach it to in order to get it under the furniture. I just thought this tool was meant for hard floors under the furniture. it never occured to me to try it on the steps and on the tile floor. i'll have to give it a try and maybe then i'd be willing to give it another star."
2,LOW REACH & LOW PICKUP,NOT REALLY A VERY GOOD PRODUCT. I EXPECTED BETTER FROM DYSON. MY CATS LIKE TO SLEEP UNDER MY BED.I HAVE TO GO OVER AREA SEVERAL TIMES TO GET THE PET HAIR UP.
3,dyson 25 low reach,I was pleased with the attachment. They only problem I have with it is it sits to low to the floor and for thinks other than dust you have to lift it a little to pick it up. I am not happy at all with the instructions. There are 2 settings and it doesn't explain why and for what just a picture of how to change it. It should be included in the price of the vacumme.
1,"pretty pictures, little info","I'm just launching a new magazine, so I have alot to learn. I have read some terrific books; this is not one of them. Basically the pictures are nice, but I honestly cannot think of one thing I learned from this book."
4,It's got everything you ever wanted to know!,"This DVD is a great gift idea and party favor. Myself being a film student I never expected a video tutorial on how to set up and shoot a fight scene! I mean this thing is packed with extras. It's all extras, its like the scene selection screen of a number of great fights (I won't say ALL because you can't expect them to put ALL the good ones on just ONE DVD can you?!) but to not check this out even for a rental is a serious diservice to your DVD player. Just go check it out nuff said..."
1,Not a good game.,This game turns around too fast to get the ball in it's mouth. My children of 5 and 7 did not like this game at all.
2,It's Now In Parts!,After one Week of tripping over it. It's now in parts in two different toy boxes. I bought in on sale for Christmas and I stilled payed to much! Hey but the putters made Great weppons for the young~ens! :-) LoL!
1,bad!!!!!!!!!!!!,"This is a depressing book about a girl but the author is a man, so she just doesn't work. They all act like grownups. This is dreary book that will leave you asking, why was i stupid enough to be lured by the pretty cover?"
3,Wrap it up,I'll keep this short: its a fascinating historical story and is worth telling and worth reading. But it's simply too long of a book. And somewhat repetitive. I'm well aware that India is a very populous country...no need to hammer it into my head continuously. Otherwise I found myself interested but had a hard time getting through it by the end.
5,A must have book for the serious African Violet grower,"I can't say enough good things about this book. The most complete book I have ever read on African Violets. So happy I ordered it, and highly recommend it!"
3,Good movie with excellent acting,"Clint Eastwood and John Malkovich are at their very bests in this spell-binding and original thriller. Eastwood, in a role not far removed from his ""Dirty Harry"", plays a veteran U.S. Secret Service Agent who is constantly haunted by his failure to prevent the assassination of Present Kennedy 30 years ago. However, Eastwood gets a shot at redemption when a mysterious stranger sets his sights on assassinating the current president. John Malkovich is terrific as the killer: a master of deception who thrives on mind-games and doing more psychological than physical harm to our hero. Plenty of twists and surprises, superb acting and a great script makes In The Line of Fire a fine chapter in the legendary career of Clint Eastwood."
5,Best Thriller ever,"John Malkovich gives a remarkable performance that is simultaneously both incredibly terrifying and gripping. Clint Eastwood gives an equally strong performance as a washed up old secret service agent. This is my favorite Eastwood film, because there is such complexity to the story but with that same Clint Eastwood attitude that gets your adrenaline pumping. There are a couple classic lines that Clint Eastwood makes unforgettable. His romance with Rene Russo is done very well, I especially like the charming piano scene, which showed some complexity and gave insight into Eastwood's character. Overall one of the best movies I have ever seen."

4,Casanova Was a Book Lover,"Hamilton can be witty or hilarious depending on the subject. He is erudite, but plain spoken. His book is well researched. Unfortunately, he can occasionally be a bit dry. If you like books on books than this is worth your time, if not than you may still enjoy the humor within."
2,Hank Haney - The Only (?) Lesson ...,Fairly difficult to read/understand. Not particularly helpful (as title woud seem to indicate).
2,"a ""weak slice"" of an effort","haney needs to write another book. i think he does have a great understanding of the swing, but it doesn't come through at all in this book. he pretty much loses the reader in the first chapter and it only gets worse.he opens by stating the goal of the swing is to keep the club on the same arc established by the shaft angle at address, but doesn't really explain why this is the objective and then proceeds to make a complete mess of trying to explain how to achieve this goal.Haney's best comments are saved for his TV color job - which at times can be very good - and I guess his work with Tiger Woods. for the rest of us, if you're looking for instruction on developing an on-plane swing try jim hardy's ""plane truth."""
5,"Great ""must have"" accesory for your dSLR","This is a great addition for my Canon lens, and for this price, you might think it is poor quality, but as far as I can see, this is great quality! The hood clicked right on and sits tight to the lens, with no signs of being loose. It shades very good from the sun, and I can take great picture in heavy sunshine!"
2,do not be confused that this is not genuine Canon Parts.,Only couple of dollars differece with genuine Canon Parts.It worked but I worried the qulity of this China made generic part.I prefer go with genuine Canon Parts.
1,not worth a penny!,I wish I was not always looking for bargains. This product should not be allowed to be sold here. The hood does not fit. I later purchased Canons hood and it slipped on right away. Stay away from this product!-JQ-
5,Who Thinks Up This Stuff??,"I love this movie. Stellar cast and diverse character development with some early-in-their-career appearances. This is a 1990 movie that doesn't have much CGI. I liked this primarily because it is (still) a unique story line with sci-fi-ish and psychological thriller-ish flavors. Very scary and suspenseful without a lot of gratuitous blood & gore. The imaginative story kept my interest throughout. Overall, a great, scary movie with a satisfying ending. Who thinks up this stuff?"
2,Very disappointing,"Like all major disappointments,I had high expectations of this Joel Schumacher thriller.Unfortunately,about a quarter of the way in,I realised these were not going to be met.The key scene where the main characters kill Kiefer Sutherland's character before bringing him back to life again was soporifically done.In fact,the acting throughout the whole film was atrocious,full stop.And,for an apparently studio production,this is shot very much like a cheap straight-to-video/cable TV movie.The inticing premise of the supernatural events these people encounter after going through the experiment is nothing more imaginative or out of the ordinary than some childhood demons from their past coming back to haunt them,which bears no relation to what they did at all.This premise is stretched out beyond breaking point as the film nears its end.Flat indeed."
1,Great cast for lame movie.,This movie is slow and lame. When I saw it when it came out I thought it was interesting. Now that I view it again it doesn't stand the test of time. I've seen X-Files episodes that have more substance than this.
5,Hot wheels,Great birthday gift for my son he loves it. Shipped fast works great with his trucks. Thanks for a great purchase
4,My son loves it!,My son is 9 and really likes the carrying case. The one we received was blue and not black but that was fine with him. It seems to be quite durable.
2,"Storage, nothing more","Works okay for storage, but so would any bag or box. Had to replace the first one I got because the latch was warped and wouldn't stay latched."
1,Not a 48 car case,"What they fail to tell you is that the ""styles vary"" means that some cases only have 12 slots. So you have to put 4 cars in one slot and let them scratch each other up. When they say 48 car case - I EXPECT 48 slots so the cars don't get messed up. Returning product and very disappointed."
4,Great storage for all those cars!,"My son (just turned 3)has so many Hot Wheels cars and this tackle-box style case is perfect for storing them. Made from thick plastic with lots of organized space for keeping all your son's or daughter's cars. Some cars are shaped so that two can fit into one space... so this case could hold more than 48. He doesn't play with the case, but He thinks the sticker on the front is cool."
5,BEST STRINGS ON THE MARKET,these are hands down the best strings out there ! they sound great and last ages!
2,Not real good,The sound quality with these are no differant than the d addario.. I wouldn't sudgest these unless your playing alot of open blue chords..they have a weak ring out..especially when you are jammin hard..
4,Excellent sound,"Excellent sound coming from these strings even with age. However I've had three incidents of either being on stage or radio where one of the strings broke on me. Sound quality +10, reliability +4. I love how they sound so I record with them, I just don't trust them when I'm performing live."
5,love 'em!,"just bought these strings-I'm not much of a guitar player, so I'm no expert on the guitar or strings-but these strings cost three times more than some quality strings I bought recently-however, I think they play great; great response from the strings; great sound-I believe they are well worth what I paid for them-"
2,Looking for specific Team panel,"I am currently looking for the Dallas Cowboys (side and front) panels for this SkyBox by Maytag vending machine, since I am having no luck at all, cannot find that particular team anywhere. These here are out of stock, and the wrong team, so if anyone out there knows where i can find/buy them online, please reply and let me know.Thank you !"
3,Alice in criticland,"It's about a girl that falls in a hole and goes into this magical world. I think ""Alice in Wonderland"" is an ok book for my age. I think it would have been a better book if I was 7 and my mom was reading it to me right before bed. If you're an adult and want a good book for your 5, 6 or 7 year old I recommend it."
2,Plenty Missing,"Generally with a fake book, you're expecting the melody line and chords for a large spread of music - the Broadway fake books and Real books are up around 800 tunes. The Christmas Fake Book is not even close. You'll find a few nuggets here, but if you want all the Irving Berlin and classic American Christmas tunes, you're not going to find many. This book is mostly standard church and traditional carols, with a little bit of popular music sprinkled in."
4,Very Good But,"Unfortunately a band of the caliber of Blue Highway is held to very high expectations. While this CD was very good it fell short of exceptional, can you call that a let down? I'm not sure that would be the correct term.With highlights like ""Born With A Hammer In My Hand"", ""Troubles Up And down The Road"" and ""That Could Be You"" this Cd does hit chords. And who would expect a cover of a Sting song? ""I Hung My Head"" is a great song that Blue Highway adapts very well to bluegrass. Also thrown in the mix are great covers such as ""Man Of Constant Sorrow"".This CD is very good and if you like Blue Highway you will enjoy it. But if you do not know Blue Highway I would suggest ""Wind To The West"", ""It's a Long Long Road"", or ""Midnight Storm"" as a better introduction."
2,Not impressed....,"I'm not really fond of this CD. Personally, I wouldn't reccomend it. Buy Dolly Parton's ""The Grass Is Blue"" instead."
4,"Like a ""Dr. Spock"" for adoption issues.","Excellent and extremely useful book. For example, the chapter on the Middle Childhood Years is entitled, ""Why didn't they keep me?"" and is full of useful advice about how to answer that critical and inevitable question."
2,Budget? What budget.,"Concept for this film was good, but the sound quality was so poor I had to turn my tv up all the way to hear anything and the over all quality for the filming is pretty low.Could be worse but not worth a $4 rental. Wait for this one to be 1.99 or free."
5,Beautiful by Design,"I bought this LP without knowing anything other than a snippet at the listening station. I was thrilled to discover that the vinyl is Clear andI must say that the version I have has a different front cover than the cd. The back cover is the same. I prefer to listen to beautiful music like this on my turntable and stereo. I save the car player for more middle of the dial. I am always a bit left of the dial myself. Pele is an indie, jazz, instrumental band that is very smooth and relaxing to listen to put on when having a glass of wine or some company of all ages. I find myself going more ambient than this usually but this does have some atmosperic depth. I really found this pleasing even on the first listen. I would love to see the direction this band goes. I do not have a reference point yet as where they came from. I will be buying some other discs of theirs soon."
5,Ten Commandments,Excellent product. (RECOMMENDED FOR ALL.)This move help a person have a better understanding of the Bible. Prompt delivery.
5,THE TEN COMMANDMENTS BLUERAY DVD,"THIS,BLUERAY, release of this film is fantastic. It adds fantasticcolor to the technicolor quality in which it was filmed.The special effects are great given their time in which thisfilm was made. It also reminds us for those of us whoknow and,understand the meaning of this film. How importanta historical figure MOSES was in freeing us from EGYPT."
1,Blue - ray special Limited edition box set,Buyer beware ! I returned this item twice and bestbuy opened up two in the store and they had damaged discs .I sent an e - mail to Paramount about this 4 wks ago and have not recieved an answer!
4,Beware of Disc #2,"Obviously this is a great movie, but I experienced years of frustration trying to get disc #2 to start. I got this advice from Toshiba: (1)load disc 2 and wait for main menu (2) go to special features and play one of the trailers (3) during playback of the trailer, press STOP (4) press T (SEARCH), select title 6 and press ENTER. Main menu will appear again (5) when PLAY is highlighted, press MENU and the movie will play. DO NOT press ENTER or the movie will lock up. It works for us! (But you have to follow these directions precisely.) Good luck!"
1,Paid ad space,"I bought this version. During the entire film a banner across the top advertised some teen movie. Of all the cheap, sleazy hustles we've been groomed to expect from the dvd revolution (whatever happened to ""multiple camera angles"") the cheesy inclusion of ad banners onto clasic movies heralds a new low for the greedy. Bad buy!"
3,Embarassing script,"The music and cinematic elements are superb.The dialogue is often beyond belief and laughable. Pretentious. I have played excerpts for the current generation and they roll on the floor in laughter.I agree also with some here that many assume some accuracy here...particularly after the rolling of credits at the start of the film which is intended to portray historical research.There is so much invention in costume, dialogue, and acting that any sense of realism is lost. This is not a story about Christianity....and neither was Ben Hur."
4,uuuuhm...,"...is this a joke, or did someone mix up something? I mean calling ""only 100.000"" a ""limited edition"" is kinda awkward, ain't it?1.000 - ok, that would be really limited. 10.000 - ok. But 100.000? Some discs are never even sold that often!So itty bitty please with sugar on top - look up if this is really correct ;)Thanks in advance."
2,The Ten Commandments: Movie,The picture is dim through-out the entire movie. It is a strain on the eyes.
1,Ten Commandments (2 Disk Blu-raay Set),"Poor Quality ""Ten Commandments""The outside box said Blu-ray), the two disk marked DVD on inside.The quality was the worest DVD I have ever purchased.It was not Blu-ray - 1080P as I Paid for and ordered.I have requested a replacement Blu-ray 1080P that I orderd at no cost to me, no response.I request other customers send me information on how to get Amazon to live up to their advertisement.PSI Connected with Cathy of Customer Service, she did an outstanding job. She has set up a replacement 2-Blu-ray-1080P disk to be sent to me. She will set up a link for me to print a prepaid UPS form, to send DVD disk to Amazon.Cathy of Amazon, did a good job,to restore my faith in the Company.Ralph"
5,Wow! Charlton Heston takes on the Egyptians with no guns!,MPEG-2 compression and reproduction are superior! This movie is spectacular! Cecil B. DeMille would be proud of this version of his timeless classic... A must have! Now I'm waiting for Ben Hur and El Cid on DVD. MM
5,A Classic,Forever one of the best classic biblical movies of all time. Being on dvd makes it that much better. Every household should have a copy of this movie. Good wholesome theatrics you won't be sorry with this purchase.
1,Save Yourself...,"Horribly acted, written, produced, and filmed; half the time you can here the echo from the sound stages. But that is only a minor criticism as many films from that era were as overacted and poorly filmed as this one. It is the literal interpretations of mythology like those found in this film that perpetrate crimes on humanity, thus proving the axiom: tell the lie enough times and the masses begin to believe it. Normally garbage like this would be laughable, but this is seriously horrifying since so many sheep actually believe this stuff really happened."
5,Excellent piece of entertainment,"This is epic old style Hollywood movie making at it's finest! This movie is excellent entertainment some 46 years later! Chuck Heston was perfect as Moses. He is outstanding and the movie is outstanding. This is entertainment first and foremost, and as far as entertainment goes, it succeeds on all levels."
3,Solid and entertaining Hollywood hokum,"The Ten Commandments showed DeMille's savvy, commerical and epic style as a film director. It hasn't aged all that well but it's still entertaining and larger than life. Charlton Heston was never the most subtle actor, but the energy and vitality he brought to his many performances always make them memorable. Yul Brynner steals many of his scenes with a sharp and sly performance.The visual effects are pretty good by today's standards and were outstanding by 50's standards. John Fulton's process photography particularly for the Red Sea sequence, is memorable. The matte paintings and process shots add to the epic elements in this fine if slightly dated film.Although not DeMille's best film, The Ten Commandments certainly can claim the crown for his most over the top production. The striking visuals, performances and visual effects make this film a memorable Hollywood epic."
2,Packaging???,"I am writing this review prior to viewing the blu-ray version of The Ten Commandments. I truely believe the movie on blu-ray will be spectacular. However, the cute packaging of the Limited Edition sucks. Please don't waste your money on this edition. Mine arrived today. The cute stone tablets that hold the disks is very cheap! In fact mine was damaged to the point that it did not hold the discs in place and they were scratched during shipment. Had to return the set. I wish when the studios released these Limited editions they would take into consideration that the blu-rays/DVDs will be opened and played. Thus designing the packaging for use. The pakaging is great if you are just going to sit there an stare at it and never open it. Thus the 2 star rating for the ""Limited Edition""."
5,shows the story of Moses from birth to Acension into heaven.,Excellent accurate achievement in putting the bible into movie form
2,packaging of discs is not good,this is about the six disc edition. The discs were difficult to remove from the tablet and they all had fingerprints and light scratches
5,Great!,This is a great movie from beginning to end. It is a classic and will be relevant in the future as well as it has been in the past.
1,Horrible Music and Terrible Lyrics,"This CD was clearly the work of an ameture. Perala Bartal has no talent. She is simply a young naive artist with a mediocre voice. As for the actual music, I don't think that I have heard more boring content in my life. Maybe perala should take a few voice lessons and listen to some good artists before she makes another awful CD. DO NOT BUY IT!"
2,It's not worth the money.,You have to use a whole lot of coffee to make it strong enough to drink. It's not a good filter. I used my normal amount of coffee that I would put into a paper coffee filter and it would be super weak- even using the bold setting on my coffee maker. I wouldn't recommend this filter.
1,Too small for Hamilton Beach Brewmaster,"Advertised for 8-12 cups, which makes a mess inside the Hamilton Beach Brewmaster. When used for 12 cups, it leaves grounds on the top of the machine that have to be carefully wiped to avoid them dropping into the machine. I'm back to using paper filters."
1,Too little,"I had to return it for a refund (which is as easy as falling off a log at Amazon). They say it fits my coffee maker but it's too small. It has a half inch clearance around it when I put it in the coffee maker. I tried it and found coffee grounds in my coffee. My theory was the grounds would splash out around the edges and get into the coffee. Soo I put it in again and this time put a paper filter in first to catch anything that was coming through. Sure enough, the paper filter caught the grounds. I don't know how the manufacturer couldn't have known about this but... So I'm back to the paper filters now....and loving it....."
2,Great Music - Beware - Copy Protected Disc!!!,"Kala Ramnath delivers, as always, stellar and flawless playing with deep, emotional maturity. Vijay Ghate's playing is crisp and tight. Excellent sonic production values throughout. The big problem here and reason for the low star rating (which pains me greatly - it would easily garner 5 stars) is the annoying copy protection software embedded on the disc. I bought the disc, can't I manipulate the data to suit my personal needs? I'm not interested in selling it to anyone! I'll spare you the rant on copy protection. Just be forwarned that this disc is in my opinion, greatly compromised by the copy protection."
3,Good but not great comedy,"This isn't a great movie by any stretch of the imagination. The script is weak, the characters absolutely one-dimensional, the plot is full of holes, and the acting is either over-the-top hamming (Steve Martin) or cardboard (everyone else). But it's funny; spending a couple of dollars on a used DVD isn't going to feel like a rip-off. Oh, be prepared for the DVD to be a full-screen cutdown from the original movie, which is really annoying. But as I write this, there are used DVDs going for $0.01 plus $2.98 shipping. For under $3, it's worth it)."
3,one of Steve Martin's best,"I consider 'My Blue Heaven' and 'Dirty Rotten Scoundrels' to be Steve Martin's finest. It's fine comedy without any slapsticks.However, the DVD version is rather disappointing. It is NOT widescreen, and there're no extras to speak of. The transfer quality is decent, but that's about the only thing makes the DVD better than VHS.4.5 for the movie, 1.5 for the DVD, that makes it 3 overall."
4,Simply fun to watch,"Martin is the ""hood"" in the Witness Protection Program, Moranis is the Federal Agent assigned to protect him. The chemistry between the two is simply hilareous. A great movie that obviously doesn't take itself too seriously. Simply fun to watch."
5,A Wonderful Movie,"This is Steve Martin's best movie, Rick Moranis and Steve Martin make a great pair. The best mobster comedy ever made. Even though the picture quality, the sound and the features of the DVD are not vey good; this movie is definately worth the money! ""Have a nice day.""...""F**k you!"""
1,Wow--so bad it's almost unwatchable!,"Few films get a one star from me. There is some humor, some cleverness, some wit, charm or insight that elevates it from dreadful to just bad. Not this turkey. It was one of those ""What were they thinking?"" films, where I wondered aloud repeately ""How could they do that?"" From the Father Guido Sarducci accent to the jokes that fall like eggless souffles, this film stinks.And I never for a moment felt anything other than This Is A Movie. Suspend disbelief? I wish! I was suspended, into animation."
5,How to make a very funny movie,"Hello,Intentional or not, this simple tale of classic proportions is the work of comic genius. Its a non-stop roller coaster of classic Steve Martin, with the very capable straight man role played by the very talented Mr. Moran. The scripts fabulous and the executions a dream.If you think Steve Martins funny, but you've never seen this one, then get it, for me it's his most funniest.Frankly, I could talk about this film all day, and then do it again tommorrow, but that would just spoil some of the fun.Regards,Martyn R Jones"
5,"Nice swirling space rock, early Phil Collins band....","Flaming Youth (the name for this band came from some source I know not what!) may have become most noteworthy as being a very early band containing Phil Collins as a member. But this is nice swirling space rock with floating melodies along the lines of ""Intergalactic Touring Band"" or Manfred Mann's ""Solar Fire"" so, if you like that type of thing, you will clearly find much to enjoy here. It was thought highly enough of in the UK to release in a deluxe gatefold LP package with a tissue stained glass window. So someone must have had high hopes. Grab it when you can at reasonable prices, it can get pretty expensive when the available copies get soaked up by collectors.Oh, one more thought, seek out the version with 11 tracks. The two extra songs are from the 45 rpm ""Man Woman and Child"" and its original B-side, which did not appear on the LP."
5,Instant classic,"The above 2 reviews are spot on and there's not much I can add.I just had to, however, confirm their findings. This CD is amazing.Manson has been a major thrill during the live concerts of George Duke, but this CD shows another side of Mike.Believe it or not, this CD rockets streight in to my classic top 15, amongSongs in the Key of live, I am, Gratitude and Another Level.Buy this CD and enjoy the vibe of Mike Manson !A typical and rare 6 star release :-)"
1,MERLE HAGGARD,"I JUST RECIEVED MY BOOK IN THE MAIL TODAY AND WOW AM I UPSET. THE COMPANY KNOWN ASABEBOOKS aka. BEAL STREET BOOKS IN FORT WALTON BEACH FLORIDALIED WHEN THEY TOLD ME THE BOOK I WAS ORDERING WAS IN GOOD CONDITION. THE SPINE IS BROKEN IN TWO PLACES AND THE BOOK STINKS.I THINK MERLE HAGGARD IS GREAT AND WAS REALLY LOOKING FOREWARD TO HAVING A COPY AGAIN,BUT WHEN A COMPANY WHO SELLS BOOKS ON AMAZON DOT COM LIES TO THE CUSTOMER AND GETS AWAY WITH IT, THAT REALLY MAKES ME MAD.SHAME ON YOU ABABOOKS aka BEAL STREET BOOKS FT WALTON FLORIDA,I HOPE YOUR KARMA HITS YOU HARD AND QUICK,GARLAND"
4,The songs include...,It All Belongs To You; When Love Comes Your Way; Should I Tell You I Love You; Between You & Me; Under the Dress; You've Got Something; Who But You; Love My Pekinese; When a Woman's In Love; Rap Tap on Wood; Love 'Em & Leave 'Em; Close; There's a Fan; That's Why I Love You; I Gaze in Your Eyes; They Ain't Done Right By Our Nell; What Is That Tune; When My Baby Goes to Town; That's What You Mean to Me; Look What I Found; Unfinished Business / Revenge; Weren't We Fools; Please Don't Monkey With Broadway; Please Don't Make Me Be Good; So Near & Yet So Far; Blue Hours; Something to Shout About
3,Good Refernce book,Good reference book. It provids concepts and material important for graduate studies and industry. I recommand it.
1,Maps & Prices need serious attention,"Although this book was published in 2006, many of the prices are out of date and at least 2 euro off. Also, the maps are not accurate. My husband and I spent lots of time searching for items listed and could never find them. After the first day, we carried another map with us and consulted it instead of the maps in the book. Also, be careful with the maps printed in the book, as most of them are not pointing north. We got turned around in many of the walking tours by accidentally turning the wrong way because of the map's orientation. Also, we tried to eat at a couple of the restaurants listed in the book. One was no where to be found, not even the street listed, and two more that we had hoped to eat at were supposed to be open and were not. We will NEVER buy another Frommer's guidebook."
2,A real sinker!,"Ordered this for a present to my kayaking husband, and we were both puzzled and disappointed. I had anticipated more poetic and meaningful words of wisdom, so to open and find ""Never leave on a road trip without a copy of 'Playboy'"" was not a good start. There are a few good points of advice ""The price you pay for a helmet is how much you value your head"" - but that's it I suppose, if you want a book that is like a grown up boy scouts guide of the dos and dont's of kayaking this is the one for you!"
5,This book saved my life!,"As the mother of an only child, I sought a lot of advice from parenting books. Many gave a list of do's and don'ts and had some good ideas,but this book has easy, practical advice.Dr. Wolf's recommended approaches are in line with my personal values, which don't include harsh punishment and spanking.I was able to decrease my stress in dealing with my child on a day to day basis and now spending time together is more enjoyable because there is practically no fussing.It's funny to see him try his temper tantrums now, because I can see his frustration when they have no effect on me. As a result, he rarely has one.I plan to give copies of this book to my friends for Christmas."
5,creative computer program for kids and adults,"This is a wonderful computer program that is easy to use, and has many creative ways to use it. It is great for my kids who are between 4 and 10, and I love playing around with it too."
4,"Yeah, baby!","If you don't like amazing, brilliant rock, this band is not for you! CD 1 seems to be a mix of faster and slower songs, and I much prefer the faster ones (i.e. Killer Queen, Another One Bites the Dust) to the slower ones (Best Friend, Somebody to Love). On CD 2, I love all of the songs. I play it all the way through without skippin' anything.CD 3, on the other hand...It's supposed to be a CD of remixes done by various artists. Well, most of them, in my opinion, are not worth the effort, and you aren't likely to find them entertaining if you're not a diehard Queen fan. If you aren't, you would probably be better off buying Greatest Hits 1 and 2 separately. If you just want the more famous songs (you know, the ones that you loved but never knew were Queen?) like ""We Will Rock You"" and ""Another One Bites the Dust"" just buy CD 1."
5,Great cd collection,I bought this for my wife as a surprise because I knew how much she loved Queen! She can definitely get her rock on with her favorite band. Great price for a great cd package for a great band. I would definitely recommend this to everyone.
3,disapointed,"This is a big disapointment. I pay 21 dollars, get about 1 and a half cd's of good music and the rest is filler. I am not interested in other people singing Queen songs. Song selection is also a problem. Many favorites are left out. My news of the world cd is better than this."
5,Me Ow!,"It's a great take-off on the spy genre, with some neat twists. I loved the cat -- Ms. Bangs got great milage out of two syables."
5,Great addition to the series! Lots of Guild action.,"Eight books and ten years into the Foreigner Universe series, you'd think that it might be getting a little tired. However, I found this book and its predecessor in the third trilogy to be very well written and riveting reads.I enjoyed the increased amount of Guild action in Pretender and it felt faster-paced overall relative to Destroyer, the first book in this trilogy.Bren continues to wallow a bit in angst over whether he was to blame for the successful coup that deposed Tabini Aiji. However, events move far too quickly for an extended pity party and soon he's right back in the thick of the action with his Assassin's Guild bodyguards.Cajeiri is moving from brat-hood to an interesting character who actually contributes to the storyline a bit more and the Dowager continues to delight yet again.Very enjoyable!"
3,Stay Tuned,"I am giving this book three stars, not because Cherryh isn't one of my favorite writers (she is) but because increasingly, each small incident in this storyline is being stretched out into its own book. I have reached the point where I am going to wait until about three more books in this series are published and then read them one after the other. That should just about amount to one regular novel. I have thoroughly enjoyed reading her books because of the way she delves into alien societies, allowing them to react to events in ways that would be logical to their societies and evolutionary histories. But I don't enjoy waiting a year for the next part of a series, only to find it somewhat of a cheat."
3,Good,"Not a stand-alone book---8th in series. If you follow the Foreigner series by CJ Cherryh, then buy it. Best books in the series were first two though (Foreigner and Invader)."
3,"Exciting, non threatening, progressive rock","3 1/2 StarsA fantastic introduction into some of the more easy-access audible virtues lying dormant in most non-progressive listener's mind's awaits in this humble concoction of potent songwriting mixed with technical prowess. The music, while feeling at times a bit dated (awfully hard to have escaped that curse for most prog bands in that nonetheless glorious musical era), balances itself out rather nicely as an accessible album on many levels. The material ranges from rockers to love songs, influenced over jazzy, jam based guidance, which never lets the sometimes overly catchy melodies get bogged down in repetition. This excellent balance between accessibility and technicality should have afforded this band more popularity."
5,Still Evil After All These Years,"How amazing it is that this episode holds up so well after all these years. The sets are still fantastic and set the tone for a very ambitious(though highly derivative) plot. The acting is solid, especially the Doctor and our beloved Sarah. And the scenes shot outside really have a feel to them, that we don't often see in Who. This is a suspenseful episode well worth watching and owning. I know I will be watching this one over and over again. The commentary is also a real hoot. How nice of Tom to join in for a change!"
3,a lesser light from season 13.,"The nightmarish, tenebristic jungle planet sets are justly celebrated, and its concept of antimatter as a life form is intriguing. But I think this is relatively weak for the early Tom Baker era. It's so quiet that it's more dull than ominous, plot elements seem to charge in right before they're needed, and the antimatter creatures look like string cheese. If you're already a Tom Baker fan, you'll like it. But if you're just looking around, there are better places to start."
1,This is NOT the version you want,"There is a different version with an introduction by Anton laVey, trust me, spare yourself the white supremacist's introduction and get the other one. Amazon doesnt sell it, and it is hard to find, but I know you can get it from the EMPORIUM at www.personalsatan.comI just ordered this garbage and then AFTER realized it was by 14 word press, which is a white supremesist propaganda front. So spare yourself the agony and PASS.Wonderful book though."
5,tanya is tanya,"as the world awaits the country/pop extravaganzaz of shania twain and faith hill, this little country gem comes around at just the right time. this is country music. not country pop. not bluegrass or mountain music or americana, this album is what country music is all about and is suppose to be. this is george jones singing 'he stopped loved her today', vince gill singing 'when i call your name', jeanne pruett singing 'satin sheets.' for anyone who loves there country music country this is for them. i have never heard an album so personally belonging to the artist who sings and not writing there own material. this album is tanya tucker, and that is the best thing about it."
5,Wow!,"Pure genius! If you're looking for something a little off the beaten path, not your typical mainstream romantic comedy, this will catch your attention and is a deep, meaningful film. Don't miss it!"
5,excellent fit,I tried 2 other items similar to this one. Both proclaimed to fit my Ford F250 truck. Neither did. This one fit perfectly!
2,Not Really a Sequel,This realy isnt a sequel to the first 3 it doesnt have anyone from the original execpt Jims Dad. How could they have Jims Dad without Jim? American Wedding was a good ending to the series and if they wanted to make another one they should have made American Reunion with everyone not this. This movie also copies almost the same idea of the 2nd one. im going to rent it and if its good ill get it just to own the series.
2,"a Liteweight ""Fast times at Ridgemount high","this film has some nice charms here&there&alot of the Joke do crack me up from time to time,but on a whole this Movie is pretty predictable alot of figuring out how things are gonna end up.i watched this recently&thought it was Fun for a weekend film,but it wasn't any different than alot of films on this tip.Eugene Levy is funny. this film is better than the last two American Pie's,but that ain't saying much.it has some funny moments though."
2,I Was Hoping For Something A Little Better Than This,"Straight to DVD usually doesn't mean anything good, and this film followed that trend. I was extremely pleased with the trilogy, loved every movie, own them all and have watched them many times. This movie just goes too far. With hardly any of the original cast, and a cheesy Stifler takeoff with a horrible ending, this film definently leaves its viewers hoping for something more. As most of the American Pie films have been heavily laced with sex and crude jokes, getting former playmates to star in this movie has just made it a movie that young teens can giggle at the chests of the counslers. Many things such as ordering tons of cameras with a credit card with no trouble at all just make this movie cheesy and unrealisitic. Coming from a HUGELY disappointed American Pie fan, I say stay away."
1,Waste of time,"American Pie was awesome. AP2 was pretty good. AP3 was not very good and this is plainly abysmal. Beyond the fact that almost nobody from the first three is in this, it just doesn't have any humor in it.The entire thing centers around Stiffler's younger brother, who captures a lot of Stiffler's original character but lacks any of the comedic value. The result is that you've got a movie where you see this guy's backside three times within the first thirty minutes.I watched this with my brother and we both quit at the half way mark because the most the movie had mustered was a simple chuckle at one point.It's just a bad movie and if you don't believe me, ask yourself why it went straight to DVD.I actually feel sorry for anybody who likes this movie. If you gave it five stars, shame on you."
1,Completely Tasteless!,"My husband rented this expecting something similar to it's predecessors. He didn't realize that ""straight to video"" means ""THis movie stinks! Don't bother! You'd be better off watching the original movie if you like that type of comedy.Band Camp completely insults it. I saw only one original AP star, Eugene Levy who plays a Quasi-counselor to the rude and annoying characters.I watched half of it asking myself, ""Was I supposed to laugh at that?"" and rolling my eyes at how truly moronic it was. Finally I realized I'd have a better time sleeping so I stopped watching altogether.I think it has no true humor and is distasteful. If you can base a movie as good by the amount of nudity and really stupid humor this is right up your alley!"
3,Good for a Laugh,"This movie could have easily done well in theatres. I understand why producers would be afraid to put it there because of how poor American Wedding turned out, but this movie plays it smart by retiring Jim, Nadia, and the gang and opting for a new generation. The movie focuses on Stiffler's younger brother, whose antics land him in Band Camp. The strength of the movie lies in its return to what made the American Pie franchise so great - dirty jokes surrounding a pseudo-romantic storyline. I laughed outloud and would gladly see the movie again."
4,"Good product, a little rough for baby","I bought these after they were used on my son in the hospital. They are very sturdy, but next time I will need disposables that are a little softer. Would recommend if needed for adults, very thick."
4,Help with Learning What to Do When,"Although not competetive with books featuring pages and pages of beautiful pictures of gardens, this book provides an easy-to -follow calendar to keep a flower garden at its best year round. Lists of plants for each season, monthly tasks, notes, and suggestions on different ways of rooting and caring for transplants make it quite readable and eminently practical. I recommend it to beginning and accomplished gardeners."
2,Royal Hunt - 'Land Of Broken Hearts' (Royal Hunt),"By the time I got through the third track,I could tell this CD just wasn't for me.'Land Of...' was apparently their debut effort.I can honestly say there is some solid playing as well as decent melody intact.Some of the cuts here I thought were 'okay' are ""Age Gone Wild"",""Kingdom Dark"" and ""Easy Rider"".Basically just straight ahead rock and roll(or maybe indie pop?)without much to offer."
5,crime time suspense,These stories were very good to read. It was hard for me to put down my amazon just for a break. It's also hard to believe the different ways people's ethics/beliefs are that can motivate them to live like this as well.
3,Rush to Print,"I wait breathlessly for every book Ann Rule puts out, but I'll begin to breathe easier now. Her last few books, this one included, have not lived up to the earlier promise of such titles as ""Small Sacrifices,"" ""The Stranger Beside Me,"" and ""If you really love me."" Granted, the crimes in her latest books have not been as spectucular, the criminals not as incomprehensible as those in earlier books, but it does seem that the publishers are rushing her to put out books to satisfy readers like me--rather than giving Rule adequate time to find a criminal type and do what she does best -- explore his/her background and bring him/her to life for the reader. Too many of the stories in ""Empty Promises"" are empty of Rule's talent for sketching out the criminal character. Too many read no better than a newspaper account--they leave you wanting to know more rather than wanting to read more.It makes me sad, but that's my take"
1,Empty Promises is an appropriate title for this book.,"What you see is what you get and I'm sorry I wasted my time and money on this one. The stories are not written well enough for the reader to make a connection with the characters, so what's the use? IF THERE WAS A ZERO RATING, that would've been what this book would have gotten. Only diehard Rule fans will appreciate this one."
5,Excellent.,"This is the third Ann Rule book I've read, and the first one that has more than one story in it. All of the stories focus on abusive men: men who beat their wives, who kill little children, etc. The story about that girl Robin I think was particularly horrifying. While I don't like this book as much as, say, ""Small Sacrifices"", I do think it was well worth the money I paid for it and I highly recommend it to any true crime fan."
4,Exceptional Quality,I am a fan of Ann Rule since living in the Seattle area in the 90's. I started out reading I-5 Killer and have read everything since then that she has wrote. I have attended her lectures and book signings! She is a GEM! Such quality and detail to the truth and letting the story flow. I cannot put her books down when I buy a new one! She always leaves me wanting to read more! I am looking forward to anything new of hers all the time! Anyone who enjoys true-crime will agree she is the QUEEN of it and a WONDERFUL writer!
2,I can't believe I wasted my time reading this book!,"I am an avid Ann Rule fan, but I was very disappointed in Empty Promises. That is exactly what readers received ""empty promises"". The short stories seemed to be written just to get a new book on the shelf. I hope the author gets new, fresh material for her next book."
5,Used to Accessorize Cane,"Seen a previous reveiw about putting these on a cane, and decided to try this myself. Workrd great and jazzed up the cane so it didn't look so plain."
5,Exactly what you need,"It depends on what your definition of ""Guru's guide"" is, but for me this was exactly the book I've needed to get from self-educated try-and-fail SQL wannabe to proficient programmer. Thank you, Ken!"
5,This is good stuff,"So many of the books on SQL server seem to be by people who know less than us working DBA's and developers. This is the real stuff. Excellent, and thank you."
2,Don't believe the hype,"This book is not as good as billed in the other reviews here. It's more of a lesson plan than a reference book. Time and time again I find the information I'm looking for to be missing from this book, instead I turn to the O'Reilly book owned by a colleague entitled ""Transact SQL Programming""---""Don't waste your money here"" is what I have to say. I'm shipping mine back and buying the O'Reilly book."
5,A must have for anyone using Sql Server,"I have over ten years of experience in the database profession. Henderson's books are the best I have seen for any dbms. I bought all three of them around Christmas time and have been poring over them since then.This book taught me how to write industrial strength programs for Sql Server. Who would have thought that the query language had this much power? The chapters on set operations, hiearchys and arrays showed me dozens of different ways of solving problems that I would have previously thought were unsolvable without pulling the data back to the client and working with it there. Being able to do all these things on the server makes applications simpler and faster.The money I paid for this and Henderson's other books is the best money I have spent on computer books in a long, long time. Very highly recommended."
3,Good Book for DBA's,"This is a good book for DBA's.Developers however, will need to find other texts related more specifically to developing applications with T-SQL, the difference can be quite pronounced."
5,Still one of the best references,I've used this book as a reference for 3 years.Great straight forward examples. Logical presentation.If you dream in SQL (you know who you are) this is a great book to own.
5,Excellent,"I believe the one word ""excellent"" describes this book. I have read this book from cover to cover, and I can not believe the reviewer who gave this book 1 star. I have been in i.t. profesionally for more than 10 years, and prior to that as a hobbyist for another 10 years. This is one of the best books I've ever read over the past 20 years. Although I have had formal training in SQL, my everyday working enviroment uses a different database language. This book helped remind me of things I once knew, and taught me many many new things. Get this book if you wish to sharpen up on your skills, I did, and it was worth every penny."
5,Teaches Children to Protect Themselves,The author does a great job of teaching parents how to coach their children when put in awkward situations and how to react when approached by strangers. She does this in ways that make sense and don't scare children.
2,Too Expensive to be Disposable,"The Good: Great design. Even smaller than the really small I imagined both in size and weight. Clix interface works great. Five stars for design.The Bad: Battery life is more like 4-5 hours, even with energy-using options turned way down. Using any less energy than my settings would make the screen completely superfluous. Died after one month. Awaiting RMA return. One star for the all-critical ability to actually use it.Conclusion: Nifty design, poor reliability or too expensive depending on how you look at it. If these cost around $5.00 each you could stock up on, say, a dozen at a time, keep a few of them charged at all times, and give them the toss as they died."
5,Must Have for Opera Listeners,This is the magazine to have with all the news and opera events around the world. The photography is always excellent. During the Met opera season each Saturday broadcast is covered including timings of each of the acts and between act features. The back always has reviews of new opera CD's and DVD. If you love opera you need this magazine.
5,fantastic,"This sequel is amazing. It's interesting, exiting with a great plot and great acting. Very beutiful ending, from spocks dramatic death to the visual views of the awakening planet of Genesis. Great. A must for all Star Trek fans to see this classick."
4,Excellent Classic Movie,"Did not disappoint - thoroughly enjoyed the extras - Designing Khan, Captain's Log and Interviews. A great cast and production and seeing the background made it all the more enjoyable."
5,The best Trek Movie,"Forget ""one of the best"", This is THE best Star Trek movie EVER. While I like all of them because I am such a Star Trek fan, This is the one movie I could watch over and over. The Director's cut is the one to own if you can't get enough and want all the extras."
5,"A teriffic, action packed movie","This was a big success. I like Kahn in Star Trek. I don't want to spoil this movie, but I can say that this was directed very well, and it has a teriffic amount of action. But this movie is also very sad as well as funny. Why? You'll have to find out for yourself. Enjoy!"
5,Dangerous Fun,"This is the first book I have read by Eileen Wilks. Now I am eagerly anticipating the sequel to be pulished on Nov. 1st - ""Mortal Danger"". ""Tempting Danger"" was interesting, and a fun story, with enough twists to keep it from being just another shapeshifter story. Lily Yu, the heroine, is tough, and smart, and Chinese, so her family is fun to hear about. Rule Turner, the hero, is sexy and werewolf royalty, so this is a satisfying pair. Ms Wilks writes well, keeping you drawn into the story. I look forward to more books about Lily and Rule and their fascinating families. If you enjoyed Rebecca York's werewolf series, you will really like this one, too."
5,Wonderful,"I have never cared much for novels that involve ""alternate realities"". By alternate reality, I mean that the book involves the paranormal/supernatural in everyday life. The characters are fully aware that creatures such as werewolves and magic exist; the world in the novel now excepts such oddities as being normal. However, once I began to read this book, I couldn't put it down. It drew me into a fantasy world, which the author has flawlessly created. The novel is filled with suspense and romance. I can not wait until the sequel.I won't explain the plot of the novel, since others on here have. But, if you enjoy suspense, romance (especially the concept of ""soulmates""), and the supernatural, then this book is for you. I promise that you will love it!"
4,"Touching Romance with a Fantasy Twist, Icky Opening Scene","""Tempting Danger"" is an alternate present-day romance, where some people have variety of magical powers. The leaing lady, L--, can sense magic in anything she touches. A police detective, she is brought in to investigate a rather icky murder case. The obvious suspect is R--, a handsome werewolf to whom L-- is immediately drawn.This is a fast paced, fun novel with surprises and passion. R-- is masculine enough to engage your sympathy; L-- is strong without slipping into radical feminism. Background details draw you in nicely, like L--'s chinese heritage. Other details (like the nearly missing ""world description"") are left extremely vague, which is slightly annoying yet typically can be overlooked. My biggest problem with this novel is that the opening scene has a really yucky and explicit description of the murder victim. This may offend sensitive readers.Overall, a fun & fast read, a pleasant story for a lazy afternoon."
3,"Dr. Howard, Dr. Fine, Dr. Howard: Please call Greenpeace","While the scene in the hospital was very amusing, the ""Blame Humans First"" theme of this flick was very thinly veiled."
4,Campy fun,"All the old stars, a good dose of comedy and suspense. Trekies will love it and it probably even works for those that don't know the characters or past history of Star Trek."
5,A fine effort,"This is a fine effort, even with some obvious scientific flaws such as capturing photons from a ship's reactor.The previous reviewer's comments about the music are totally wrong. This score of Leonard Rosenman was nominated for an Academy Award, and the film has very, very inventive music throughout--everything from technopop (YellowJackets in the San Francisco scene) to contemporary art composers such as Pendereski."
2,"Sad, stupid movie.","I love Star Trek but when the actors think that they know more about the audience than the originator, it gets ugly. Here's a perfect example of why actors should be in front of the camera and not behind it. No, comedy is not why the original series was so popular. No, I don't want want to see the original cast members make complete idiots of themselves. And no, I don't think that ""Save the Whales"" is a worthy topic for Star Trek to tackle. Yeah, it's just a TV show but it was a good one and doesn't deserve this treatment."
3,"Silly premise, but still a good time","There's really no good reason why someone should go backwards in time to retrieve humpback whales, but that doesn't stop this movie from trying. And that's really my only complaint. The premise is really pretty silly, but this is still one of the most light-hearted and enjoyable Star Trek movies in the series. If you are looking for a lot of space adventure, it doesn't deliver like some others, but there are a lot of laughs. It also completes the story arc that begins in ""Wrath of Khan"", and I think brings that whole saga to a nice conclusion."
1,Stink-o DVD !!!,"Boy! Compare the picture quality of this movie to the episodes of the original shows that Paramount is releasing. Star Trek IV is grainy, and has a soft focus. Why couldn't Paramount had gone back and cleaned up the image of it's Star Trek movies, to look as good as the episodes? As for the film, it is a fun adventure about the preciousness of life. Too bad you can not enjoy it due to Paramount's lazy treatment of it's presentation on DVD..."
4,Save the whales!!!,"Okay, someone let the environmental wackoes into the script writing room, but I think it is the second best of the movies. The wrath of Kahn being the better one. I like the use of humor and find this to be a mix between sci-fi and comedy. If you are a trekkie or just like this sort of stuff, you have got to watch this one."
2,Didn't age well,"I saw the movie when it came out when I was younger and recall liking it well enough, but it did not age well. I actually found it a bit hard to watch at this point, though still consider myself a star trek fan. I have enjoyed the latest movies to come which feel much less campy then the ones from this era."
5,Best Star Trek Movie,"I used to watch the original series and have seen most of the movies. However, THIS one captures the characters the best. It has the same flavor as the series.I especially enjoy the byplay between Kirk and Spock.....hilarious! ""Well a double dumb ass on you!"""
4,great movie,"this is my favorite startrek movie by far. theirs alot going on, spock isnt acting himself, kirk needs a whale, they dont know how their going to get back earth is being drained of electricity, the whales lives are in danger,and scotty needs parts to turn the ship into an aquarium. if you loved the 80s,youll love this startrek."
1,painted key labels wear off in months,"Very light use of the keyboard, only web browsing, wore off the painted key labels in six months on several keys. Too bad such a nice design could not have been supplied a tad more costly but usable. Stamped/inscribed or permanent labels used to be found on even cheap keyboards, so this is a new low in manufacturing, and just not acceptable in keyboards. It shouuld not be sold (I'll just discard my second one kept for a backup though never used and new in box).You can feel that the labels are only painted on and not stamped into the keys by feeling with fingertips how they are raised slightly above the surface, and the key surface is not as slick as the harder plastic finishes. Yet even softer rubber keys can have properly molded labels (think cell phones).Will have to see if the otherwise good mouse works with other keyboards."
1,Mostly for lunguistics...,"Beautiful, great pictures. And some extra technical information you don't find other places.BUT the language is such that you squirm in your chair of embarassment. The most objective that can be said about it is that it's amazing how many idolising adjectives and adverbs there are in English, and how embarrasing they can be used, even if they are thoroughly distributed.For reading I would instead recommend to try to get a used version of ""Blue Bird and The Dead Sea"" and to read Craig Breedloves 20 chapter story about his Spirit of America."
4,Hugging Thighs,"When I got these pants I was like..Woohoo then put em on and was somewhat surprised at how tight they where in the pelvis and thighs..but after wearing them more they seemed to form more to me becoming less tight, overall these pants look slick and are comfortable... a very good buy for the price."
3,Great fresh R&B!,"Tyrese has really made a big impact on me lately, he's great soulish voice is defenitely suited for ballads, and ""How you gonna act like that"" is arguably one of the best slow jams out there right now. With his last album he proved that he was able to make some good uptempo songs like ""I like them gitlz"" too however on this album Most of his songs are ballads though and it the end we get the message and it get's a little dull. His collaboration with singer/producer Jermaine Dupri in ""Girl i can't help it"" is a little faster (a uptempo song with cool beats), so is ""U Don't Give A Damn About Me"" and ""Taking forever"" but the latter two are simply not that good. The slowjams however is the reason why most people would buy this, and he makes them good, so defenitely a decent album, In the future i expect some more of him though."
3,Pleasing movie,"Bright, spirited film with little value except for early Bacon. Chick flick from the word go. Service was quick and efficient."
3,a little overstated,"I think that ""Bleu"" has failed in what most more or less watchable films made in the 90s have failed. While it is beautifully shot, has a good casting, an appropriate musical score, and a number of highly original (and therefore interesting) scenes (where the use of music, the use of silence is very effective), on the whole it is rather pointless and thus boring. While watching it, I could not understand why it should have been called ""Bleu"". This story about a woman who survives a tragedy and has to struggle with her past (and present) is at times very delicate and realistic - and these scenes do come up in my mind from time to time - but it is shown in a way too limited in scope; the film on the whole does not remain in your mind for long, it lacks some strength, some backbone. I tried watching it the second time but it proved to be too boring to bear. I, nevertheless, would recommend everyone to see and think about ""Bleu"" by himself."
4,Great Movie!,"I always loved this movie from the first time I saw it. It's mysterious, yet in your face. The growth of Binoche throughout the film is mesmerizing. Only problem was there was no French subtitles, something I wanted. Haha"
3,Best of the Airport Films,"Although this is not one of the best films I have seen per se it stands out as memorably daft but highly enjoyable. It stands as the best of the four Airport films and is complimented with a fine cast who do more than just play it by the numbers, tempting as it may be. It may sound silly - a plane crashing into the sea, sinking beneath the waves leaving the crew and passengers with the difficult problem of getting out - but somehow it works. An enjoyable piece of nonsense to wile away a couple of hours.This is a good transfer DVD - the picture and sound are good. My only complaint would be the lack of features - no trailer, no biographies, not even a mention of its ""siblings"". Still, a worthy addition to my collection."
2,HAO3 Lamp modules are not routing nodes,"I am relatively new to Z-Wave home automation and have only a couple of switches installed. I am interested in installing a few lamp/appliance modules as a simple way of extending the range of my network by utilizing the routing feature of Z-Wave nodes. The literature and packaging indicate that the HAO3 modules included in this kit have ""Built-in `repeater' function for reliable signal reception"" and I thought that the kit would be an inexpensive way to build out the mesh on my network. When I got them installed I learned that they do not. They are classed as ""Slaves"" not ""Routing Slaves"" and do not forward Z-Wave packets to neighboring nodes, making them useless for my intentions. I have decided to keep them as they are still useful as dimming lamp modules, but since I use very few standalone lamps in my home, their use is somewhat limited."
3,Basic etiquette of interacting in ASL is offered.,"This tape is for a beginner who has no previous experience with the deaf community. The etiquette of interacting with the deaf population is shown. For those unfamiliar with deaf interaction, this is extremely important. She gives very basic information including such important factors as facial expression, numbers and alphabet plus a limited vocabulary in ASL. This tape can help a neophyte get started but is disappointing for people already familiar with deaf culture and seeking to expand their vocabulary."
4,Excellent,I had taken a community school class and I learned more from Renee. It was a good start to learning basic sign language. She started with basic vocabulary. She was clear and slow which made it easy to understand. The best thing about the video is that you can watch it over and over.
4,Needs a Remote for Volume Control,"Very good unit with fantastic sound. This unit is heavy, but rightfully so. Not only are you lugging an amplifier around, you also have a heavy batery in this unit. The battery life is very good. I charged it up and used the radio for several days on and off before it drained. I do think this should come with some kind of remote that will change channels and adjust the volume. The xm remote is fine for channel changing, but you have to keep the radio close enough to you to adjust volume, or mute.One thing that I consider a quirk in this unit is that when you turn the power on using battery power only, you must also hit the play/mute button or it won't turn the radio on. The first time I tried to use this unit without the AC power, I thought it was broken. It was by chance that I hit the second button that made this unit work. :-)Overall, I like and recommend this unit."
2,Falters just after the first few pages,"First off, I am a big fan of most things voyager. In fact, there are few things of ST: Voyager I don't like. This book falls into that latter category. The plot starts out promising, but ends up dragging out several aspects of the plot, including the 'one voice', which isn't really described in the book. Also, the author must love earthquakes, as it seems the planet the crew finds themselves on loves to try to shake itself to death, but the crew doesn't seem to care. Character development is almost null, and the entire crew seems a little, hmm, 'off' when it comes to making decisions. Janeway makes decisions that are not the kind she would make, Tuvok starts to show a little emotion, and Tom Paris is not nearly the wise crack he should be. In fact, Tom Paris seems very mellow in this book. Oh well, not all books can be superb."
1,It was so boring I couldn't force myself to finish it.,This was the worst Star Trek Voyager book of all. I thought the author spent way too much time developing and emphasizing an alien culture that was totally uninteresting. I wanted to be enthralled by an adventure the crew of the Voyager but they seemed to take a back seat in this novel. I like novels that give us insights into the personalities of the main characters but this book was way off base.
4,opinion,"This had very interesting reading, but some of the recipes were laborintensive and needed equipment that was sort of expensive.One recipe I tried did not come out quite as I had planned, but willtry it again, modifying it a tad. I guess I just need to get the hangof what is going on and plan ahead of time, the recipes I wouldbe using during the week."
2,Pool basketball/volleyball,"The first day we had it the kids were playing with it and each time the ball hit the rim, it would bend down more. I can't get it to stay up again. We were very disappointed, especially given the price."
4,Lounge with a Twist of Strange,"I enjoy Lounge music and exotica especially when the conductor/arranger is trying to experiment with new high tech stereophonic or Hi Fi sound. Ok so its nothing new to us now but back then in 1958 it was the latest brake through in recording technology. And Esquivel was at the time trying to use this new tech to its fullest by arranging the music not only to present the music in a unique manner as any other arranger would, but also thinking about right channel, left channel, fade in, fade out, and also both channels. I always suggest to anyone, who purchases any music from this time period, ""have you listened to it wearing headphones"". And truly Esquivel's music is not fully appreciated until it is heard wearing headphones. The music and arrangements are beautiful and Esquivel's piano stylings are unreal. This and all of Esquivel's work is a must have for any Lounge music fans."
2,please tell me OF Constitutional law FOR America,"Have I read the entire book yet..... no I haven't. Alot of work went into this treatise and my admiration for its creation goes to the author... However, lawyer 'oath' be damned ..... I do not nor will not appauld these 1300 pages when the word OF were replaced the word FOR ...... when writing about The Contitution FOR the United States of America."
5,The best Con Law supplement out there!,"If you need a great Con Law supplement, then look no farther, you have arrived. This book lays out summaries of all the relevant cases that dictated constitutional interpretation and the way the const. is applied these days. It cogently goes through all the information in a great manner. It is an easy read for such a complicated subject. I have bough many other supplements for this subject and really nothing comes close to this. Also, dont get intimidated by the size, you can basically find the section you need and learn what you have to, no need to read hundreds of these pages if you just need clarification. This book has taught me much more than my casebook, BUY IT!!!"
4,"Yes, it is worth it. Yes, you do want to buy it.","What you need to know: Chemirinsky is the con law bible.1. You do want to buy it and read it in conjunction with your casebook for every assignment. Even if your not the type to obsess over supplements, this book is still for you.2. If everyone in your section does not already own it...they will by the end of the semester, so just save yourself the headache and get it now.3. Yes, you can totally get away with saving money and buying the previous edition!! I compared throughout the semester and there was a virtually no difference between the two. Good Luck."
4,Constitutional Law: principles and Policies (Introduction to Law Series),Its a good book to go along with the text book. The book in written in plain english for those that want the clear meaning behind Constitutional issues.
3,The Wrong Photo on the Box !!!!,"While I find this to be a decent yet minor film in the Redford cannon, my real problem is that the distributor (Good Times Video) is using a picture of Redford from ""Out of Africa"" on the box cover instead of a photo from ""Willie Boy""... Hopefully when the DVD is released they will fix this embarassing oversight."
5,The most amazing cook book I ever owned,"By now I have tried almost ALL recipes in this book, this is how addictive it is... I began with the simple ones, like provencal herb chicken and pear pastry desert - and they all turned out outstanding. This encouraged me to try out new, more exotic ones. I have no doubt that the author has tried out all of the recipes, because each and every one of them turns out simply superb!"
5,Love this perfume!,"After wearing this in high school, my mom became just as addicted to Jessica Mcclintock as I was. I still switch it up, but this is her tried and true. I love you, Amazon!"
5,"Cool, citrus, slightly floral scent...","Cool and citrus comes to mind when I smell this perfume. There is a slight floral smell, too. It has good staying power throughout the day (and I apply it only sparingly--just one light spray). I would describe it as a light scent rather than a heavy, warm scent. It is very appropriate for summer, but I wear it year round; because I like the smell. Don't know it anyone else has this problem, but when I wear most perfumes, the fragrance you smell in the bottle becomes altered on me somehow--usually for the worst. But this perfume smells the same on me as it does in the bottle."
4,No Sophomore Slump,"While I still prefer Blanket Warm overall, I was impressed with the dimension that the more aggressive songs (e.g., The Hypnotist) add to the picture this lush music paints. I think this album is missing the narrative element of Blanket Warm and is a bit less consistent, but nonetheless I recommend the second album from these midwestern minstrels highly."
1,Waste of money,"First of all, this very expensive printing stop watch comes without instructions or an owner's manual. I went online to get a PDF to tell me how to set up the paper, how to work the stopwatch, etc.When it came time to change the paper, the printer stopped working. It no longer prints out the splits, it only prints out the message ""STIT TI"".I looked online to see what this might mean and someone else posted the same problem, but there was no solution. Don't waste your money!"
3,Excellent movie on war consequences,"This silent movie features superb film transfers of this silent film classic. The technology advances with lighting and scene composition are common in today's films. The graphic nature of the consequences of war to those who actively participate and those who are innocent but forced into participating are well developed. The physical living conditions of men in combat is well demonstrated. The question ""what has my death contributed to benefit my loved ones"" is broached and an answer is suggested."
3,mas o menos,no es la mejor compilacion de exitos de franco de vita solo hay como 5 o 6 canciones buenas.
4,Logan's Run,"I think that Logan's Run is definitely in the class of those 70's science fiction flicks which we can still enjoy today. Even though the special effects are dated, they do not detract from the movie. Michael York and Jenny Agutter portray their characters well.When I was growing up I enjoyed this movie primarily for its story. As an adult I can appreciate the movie's message at a deeper level."
3,Logan's Run,"Old cult classic, science fiction, when people are not allowed to live past 30. Small role with Farrah Fawcett."
2,Weak,"Tripe. Really really bad. I had never seen it before but based on the reviews I figured it would be perfect along side the other classics I love.. Blade Runner, Tron and THX1138... it turned out to be quite mediocre.avoid."
1,age-ism is a form of race-ism,"i saw this film once when i was eighteen on a rented vhs,and i was bored out of mymind by the visuals and disgusted by the theme of the story. enough said."
4,Great Sci-Fi,"Pretty good theme and story. The sets... wow, some of them are cheesy, some of them are done really well.I love this movie!"
3,"The old 70s ,,no problem,, Sci-Fi.","What a wonderfull two houres of entertainment i had wheni saw Logans Run again,,last time was +- 20years ago and it is still great!!Just that wonderfull sort of SciFi they don,t make anymore.To bad though,it is only on region1Otherwise i could have played it on my home cinema system.In this case i played it on my pc.Robert Hellmannrobhellmann@zonnet.nl"
3,Revisionist history strikes again,"I first saw Logan's Run in 1982 or 1983. Our local theater had a ""beat the heat"" special where you could see some ""older"" movies for a dollar during the super hot summer months.I saw Logan's Run one hot July afternoon and liked the movie itself quite a bit.The other main reason I remember it so well, is, even though it is rated PG the scene where they come out of the river and into the frozen section featured the main actress in full frontal nudity. (hey, I was 13 or 14 at the time, you remember certain things)I hadn't thought about the movie in a long time and saw something that reminded me of it and ordered the DVD. Well the nude scene has been redacted by a few frames or so and now features the actress topless only.The actress by the way is Jenny Agutter, who later went on to appear in An American Werewolf in London. Again fully nude and again on the DVD edited down.I'm guessing if I order M*A*S*H* on DVD the shower scene will be cut too?"
3,2.5 stars out of 4,"The Bottom Line:The first 40 minutes of Logan's Run are interesting, but once Logan begins his run the movie loses its urgency and devolves into a strange and not terribly convincing portrait of the future--look elsewhere for dystopian thrills, this one's dated and forgettable."
3,good but broken,Great product! However one of the coaster was broken during shipment. The rest were in great shape! They sure are thirsty!
2,Not what they look like in the picture,In the picture they look like a really nice rock appearance but instead they ACTUALLY look like a cheap pasted on picture. Even if they get wet and absorb some water they do not look nice.
5,Top of the Pops in 1997,"This disc is a must have for fans of Beatles, Beach Boys, Apples In Stereo, etc.. My favorite in 1997."
4,Great rods!,"I bought three of these for three different rooms. They are easy to install and have an extra screw in the brackets to hold the rod in place. The spiral design screws in and out which is sometimes difficult to get them symmetrically aligned, but easy to add and remove the curtains! Great product!"
4,pregnant wife cravings,"I am from Hawaii and was looking for Violet Crumble. I heard that it is now banned in the USA so this is what i had to settle for. My wife was craving this when she was pregnant . You know what they say "" Happy wife Happy life!"""
4,yummy,"The only reason why I'm giving it 4 stars is because the crunchies were smaller than I'd expected but it gets 5 stars because they tasted the same as the ones I grew up with and they arrived almost a month before expected. Unfortunately, I had to share them with family and friends."
3,Bus but where's little characters?,"Bus... I saw it, touch it, study it... well it's good for storage but as playset.. so-so because when I read it said hold sort of number of minis (due to slots) but there are more minis... Good idea for young kid to play with it as ""bus"" itself than lego.I totally agreed about mini characters... Well I am not happy with Mattel company. I feel like they are toying with us. I never saw series 2 and 3 in stores. Bam! Saw them on ebay. That is not right. It's lot of unfairness. Still... Mattel need a lot of learn to listen to us what we need rather than take advantage of us with ""false hope (As sneaking shock on Ebay.)"" It was like withholding information from us."
2,Great when it works,"Very convenient to move this unit between the car and the boombox. However the FM modulator would not work at all in our new 4Runner, even with a simple antenna added to it. We use a cassette adapter -- it degrades the sound quality somewhat. If we had it installed again, we'd buy and install the adapter needed to connect the FM modulator output to our FM radio's antenna cable.The red display began to be intermittent before it was a year old, now it completely out (15 months old) and is going back to JVC. Hopefully they'll give us a refurbished unit in exchange."
4,Satellite Radio= Regular radio never again,"I received my Sirius Satellite radio for Father's day. Couldn't be happier, and don't see myself listening to regular radio ever again. I didn't give it 5 stars for only 1 reason. The FM modulator is a bit dissapointing. I travel about 100 miles a day in my car and have to change the station I'm listening to the radio on at least once. While the JVC unit makes it pretty easy, it can be a little bit of a pain. Overall, the unit is great. I used to laugh at people having a remote control with their radios, now I see why they have them...just soo much easier to use. GET SATELITTE RADIO NOW!!!!"
2,Where do I find the active sleep mode?,"I just got the book today and look thru but I'm trying to get the sleep mode back,when I press the button it won't go sleep or wake up, so how can I turn on active back on sleep mode for compaq presario? Please let me know thanks. WJP"
1,The Urantia Book,"Being a Christian, I was very uncomfortable reading this book. It reads for a while as if it supports Christianity, but then the unknown writers go into great detail in an attempt to explain away the Biblical miracles of Jesus. I believe the book is Satanic and I will destroy it, rather than pass it on for others to read."
1,"DANGEROUS, INSIDIOUS","This book seems fairly underground, i.e., actively plied in its own circles, but not mainstream like other beliefs. I think this is by design. The official Urantia site allows the search of text via keyword. Try ""race"" and see what happens, like ""superior"" and ""inferior.""This is scary stuff, makes ""Mein Kampf"" look like a Sunday paper circular. Sadler was either a quack or a whacko, or both. In any case, WAKE UP. More people need to be awakened to the insidious nature of this vile tome ... otherwise its idiotic ""scientific facts"" and ""revelations"" will ruin countless children ... but then again, what value is a child when the supposed ""Thought Adjuster"" doesn't show up till age 5? What kind of parenting is that?PEOPLE, THIS IS SICK."
2,The Urantia Book,"This is a poorly presented discussion of spirituality loosely based in the Christian story. The entire Urantia premise is not based in any known ancient Scritpure and does not present source materials to support its claims. Further, there is no attribution of authorship. The Scriptures of the Hebrew Bible and the Christian Canon of the Bible have, at least, ancient manuscripts that can be dated to the times of authorship, or at least within one or two centuries, and provide, at least, the name of purported authors. There are more original or near original manuscripts of the Hebrew and Christian texts than most other ancient documents.Urantia does not meet the test of authority."
3,the urantia book,"this book was a gift for my daughter who was told about the book from a friend and she thought it sounded interesting needless to say i ended up reading it. when reading this book at times i was really interested and it made a lot of interesting points but then at times some of the things just made me laugh, its a good book if you have an open mind and it gets you thinking too. i thought it was going to be more fact than fiction"
4,A beautiful collection of traditional songs,"From the first time I watched ""Sharpe's Rifles"" the voice of John Tams stood out as one of the best voices I have ever heard for traditional music. His voice is hauntingly beautiful, and at it's best with minimal instrumentation. This album delivers John Tams' voice at it's (almost) best, something I didn't find on his CDs ""Home"" and ""Unity"", however it is marred by the use of too many instruments. The songs are all beautiful and well done, but if you're looking for the sparse and amazing style exhibited in the movies, you won't find it here. Also, The marches I find almost grating(after I bought the CD I burned it without the marches). This CD also features the voice of Kate Rusby, another talented singer.Even with the negatives I gave this CD 4 stars, because it is so enjoyable to listen to!! I reccomend it to anyone who likes Sharpe's or traditional music. It is definetely worth the money!!"
2,Needs More Music from the Series,"For having 20 tracks, this CD is disappointing. The Sharpe Theme and Over the Hills and Far Away are some of the few memorable spots in the CD. While John Tams and the other musicians provide enjoyable music, it would have been nicer to have more of the themes from the series itself.Noticeably missing is the dramatic music from the melee/combat sequences, as well as some gentler themes from the movies.A portion of the CD is enjoyable for Sharpe's fans - and you might like all of the music-inspired-by - but I would have preferred more of the original score."
3,"Excellent in general, but","The historical data is accurate, the relationships between the Marines, Mc Arthur, and the Army is incredibly enlightening, and the description of the Brotherhood of Marines is outstanding. The main character was a bit too fictional, and the ever present references back to the daughter just did not fit. Lastly, the author made me feel as cold as I actually was in Korea...overall, a very good read."
4,As long as he stayed with Korea...it worked.,"I found James Brady's book to be a good one, but only when he stayed with Korea and the situation of the Marines on the ground. That worked very well; one could feel the cold, the apprehension, hear the bugles if you will.But when he was building these characters I think he spent too much time cutting them out of a copy of Harper's from the late 40's. This works in an Anton Myrer piece of fiction, but comes off clumsy here. I found it a distraction. Other than that, the book worked for me. I would have liked his lead character to have been more like Joe Owen, author of COLDER THAN HELL.Now on to General Simmons' ""Dog Company Six""!"
1,Genuine hackwork,"This book can only be meant for lazy undergraduates obliged to write a paper for teachers the likes of Mr. Gillie. Imagine setting Austen ""firmly"" in the context of her times-as though this context was what she didn't say no to."
3,Is there really a megrimum?,"Knee-Knock Rise is a book that is slightly interesting with an okay story. When Egan goes to Instep he hears of the megrimum, a monster that lives on top of Knee-Knock Rise. When it rains, the megrimum howls because he wakes up. Is the megrimum a nice or a mean monster? Is there really even a megrimum? To find out the answers to these questions, read Knee-Knock Rise. I recommend this book to everyone that wants to learn a moral from a book."
1,Wendy,"Garbage! I have not even made it to chapter 1 yet and there are SO many spelling mistakes. Not sure who proof read this but they sure didn't have even a basic grasp of the english language. That bieng said, there is no reason to read anymore of this garbage - if the author was so lazy not to even use the spell check I don't have alot of confidence in the rest of this book. Don't waste your money."
4,"Where Is ""Holiday"" On Single DVD?","I really, really hate to write a negative review...especially when I want the studios to keep mining their vaults for DVD releases of classic films. So many have yet to be released...but the profit margins are slimmer than the money to be made on the latest action flicks.But why in the world would they not release Holiday as a single disc? I own three of the other four DVDs...and I'm sure I'm not alone. Is it an oversight? Or greed?One thing I do know...writing or emailing the studios can make a difference. Signature campaigns by movie fans got several of the recent '40s and '50s DVD releases to happen. So go to the studio homepages and let 'em know what you think.And good for them for releasing these movies...I can vouch for the high quality of the transfers of three of them. But release Holiday by itself...please?"
2,Lackluster twin to My Favorite Wife,"Sorry to say it, but I find this to be a lack-luster twin to My Favorite Wife. The character interaction is shallow, and missing the magic that was so funny between Grant and Dunn. I love most of Grant's films, but this one goes on the back shelf for when I need something to put me to sleep."
4,A screwball highlight!,"From the heyday of the screwball comedies, this amusing and often hilarious romantic farce shows Hollywood in its best light vein. ""The Awful Truth"" provides a consistently witty script, memorable scenes and lines, smooth comedy direction, and established Cary Grant in a genre which he made his own, and typecast Ralph Bellamy for years (his ""type"" was hysterically sent-up in ""His Girl Friday""). Typical of the vintage comedies of the thirties, the laughs are neither telegraphed nor forced; pleasantly rewarding for the audience who like their comedy to connect with their funny bone via their brain, and not their glands. Diverting fare of the most amusing kind!"
3,Doesnt stay inflated,"I bought 2 pools, one for inside and one for outside. Neither one stayed inflated after a few days. I have one child and on the inside pool the middle ring has a hole or something wrong with it and the outside pool has the top ring deflated. Didn't last very long."
1,Junk,"We have owned this less than a week and are disaapointed. The top ring deflates no matter how frequently I fill it with air. It sits on our lawn and is beginning to lose its form, it looks like the sides are sagging down from the weight of the water. It is already August so I am hoping it will last until the end of the summer. But I am not sure it will. Worthless. Spend your money on something else."
3,Lasted a week,"Only lasted about a week before springing multiple leaks. I only needed it that long, so I wasn't too sad and now I can throw it over stuff to keep the rain off"
2,Huge disappointment.,"Looking into reviews for this book I decided to buy it without any doubts. I just finished this book and I can tell you that in my opinion this book is very poor and condensed version of ""Applying UML and Patterns"" by Craig Larman (which I just addore) and ""Web Master in Nutshell"" (which is pretty good and solid reference/introduction into web related technologies). If you read both these books don't spend your money on this one because you won't find anything new. Cheers."
3,Great book for people moving from static to active HTML,"Jim does a great job of helping the novice developer understand how HTML-based projects can benefit from established methodologies for analysis and design.If you've already done server-side programming, don't waste your time on this book. However, if you are transitioning from doing static web design to working with developers and database administrators on back-end functionality, this book will help you navigate this new domain.The book only rates a 3 because is promises value not just to analysts and designers (which it does well), but also to project managers, architects, and web programmers (all of whom would likely be bored to tears with most of this volume).Another useful aspect to this book is the way that it reviews the landscape of competing technologies in the web development arena. His perspective is unbiased, although his examples are heavily dependent on Microsoft standards."
1,Only some suggestions on how to model web elements.,"Simply stated, the author should *not* be talking about software development, but only introduce his notation and explain it. That's all. His coverage of use cases, OO analysis and design is useless, when not misleading.Leave it on the shelf. Is you need to develop web applications buy something related to the particular technology you are working with (e.g. servlet).For the UML, buy something serious...And, of course, Applying UML and Patterns, if you want a good introduction (and more) on OO Analysis/Design."
2,Would not recommend,"One of the biggest dissapointments ever. I have been waiting for this game for ages and I was not impressed at all. I am still trying to figure out as to why do I have to spend half the time lost in a complete darkness? There must be a reason for it, but I really cannot see one. At one stage my eyesight was beginning to suffer as I would get completely lost trying to find a single trace of light to help me see where I am actually going. This can be very annoying, especially if it is 3am and you really want to pass that level. OK, there is a compass that you can use, but still..."
5,WOW,"i myself am a fan of games like this and i know that every once in a while a great game comes along that renews the genre this was one of those games everything about this game is great the graphics, a.i., replayability (if you replay levels you can get medals by doing special thing), its realistic, and its easy to play if i were you i would buy this game now"
5,BEST WW2 SIM EVER !!,I only played mision one level 5 at best-buy in vernonhills.(don't mension I went there)and saw this guy therewho nearly won that level but got bored and quit out.After that i gave it a whirl. The controls are fairlysimple. You use your mouse to turn and fire your weaponsand hold down the W key to walk. use the number keys to switchweapons.Sounds simple?Theres a million other controls!! try it for yourself!
4,Medal of Honor : Allied Assault,"Medal of Honor : Allied Assault is a fps set in the real world during the second world war and you get to play an american soldier. The multiplayer gameplay is poorly designed but the single player gameplay is excellent with great level design, fairly good enemy ai and intresting missions, But it has the worst ending ever in a computer game. The d-day mission is one of the best levels ever in a fps, it makes you feel as if you are really there and it is quite disturbing, It alone is worth buying the whole game. Mohaa is built on the quake3 engine, I played it on the OpenGL video mode and it runs great. The graphics and sound are great but the main menu is badly designed and confusing. The load times are not long and the quick loading is almost instant. Medal of Honor : Allied Assault is an excellent computer game and not to be missed if you like fps."
5,Saving Private Ryan meets Band of Brothers in a Game,Medal of Honor - Allies Assault is a visual treat that transports the player back into WWII with fantastic graphics and fantastic game play. The missions vary in style and difficulty. The jewel has to be the Normandy Beach landing in which you start in the landing craft and must make your way to the shoal. It brings the opening beach assult from Private Ryan clearly into your mind. The side conversations on the assault are a great addition for realism.If you like the 1st person genre you must play this one.
1,VERY DISAPPOINTED,"I have been a MOH player on PS one since it came out and have loved each of the games. Since I don't have the PS2 I got MOHAA for my PC. I have had nothing but problems since. I have spent at least 5-10 hours trying to troubleshoot the game to no avail. I have been dying to play this and have had nothing but grief. For those good reviews, I am sure the game is entertaining, but for those having the same problems, it has been a nightmare. I feel like one of those guys landing at Normandy who gets shot before he even gets out of the landing craft! VERY DISAPPOINTED!"
2,Stop reading reviews & BUY THIS GAME !!! :-),It may be a game but once you are in the June 6th mission....Amazing game. Better have a high end computer to run this.This will be THE GAME of the '00 decade by which all others are measured
2,illogical and unrealistic,"The game does not allow you to take your own route to a target although it seems you can move around freely. Order of actions are also very restrictive. If you attack point A then point B, you will succeed, otherwise will fail but A and B are just the same. Some snipers just cannot be killed until they fired at least one shoot at you. The compass does not give you much clues of where to go as many times it points to a deadend.Finding the entrance of the next level is sometimes unreasonable. It is frustrating and time wasting. In one mission you cannot proceed until an enemy tank punches a hole on the wall so you can go through it to the next level.The design of the game is a straight line which you can only follow without deviation. However, the layout of this line is obscure. You have to 'die' many times to find it out."
2,Bad Multiplayer,"This single player for this game is absolutely stunning. Just as an example, take the graphics and the sound from Omaha beach. The machinegun fire actually sounds like it is hitting the obstacles, sand, or hitting a iron obstacle and falling into the water. The emotions of the Americans are portrayed exactly by voice acting and facial expressions. HOWEVER, the multiplayer for this game is boring and not innovative at all. After you beat single player, this game is worthless. RTCW has a much better multiplayer, and I recommend it over this title because RTCW had better multiplayer graphics, and its just more fun and lasts longer."
1,Save your $$$,"Boy,what a letdown.I don't like this game at all.ince when should you need to dump a 30 round clip into an enemy before he drops?Buy call of duty,much better game.Graphics are better too!"
5,best shoot em up so far,And once you are done with playing against the PC you go online and play thousands others (clans) among others that are less predictable than the game. A very fun game with lots of expansion possibilities both in mods and maps and weapons You wont go wrong with this one.
5,Medal of Honor: A must have!!!,"medal of honor allied assault is a must have. sadly i dont have this game but i play it at my friends house. anyway, in Medal of Honor, you play Leiutenant Powell of the US Army. You get to use authentic WWII weapons such as Thompson SMG, Brown Automatic Rifle (BAR) and some others like M1 Garand, MP40, Colt .45, and Mauser Kar98k sniper rifle. There are about 10 missions, each having four to five different parts to them. The missions take about 20- perhaps 60 minutes long depending on which mission it is. The enemy AI is very intelligent, like they run away from grenades and dodge your bullets realisticly. Its very fun and very challenging and i really reccomend it. BUT, there is one problem with it!!! the ending stinks!!!! i wont tell u what it is youll just have to find out. i think they ended it the way they did so they could make way for the Spearhead expansion pack, which i have never played. good luck playing MOH:AA -patrick"
3,Medal of Honor - Disappointment,"I looked forward to this game with anticipation, as I am a big history buff - and a gaming enthusiast.. However, electronic arts rushed this out without much de-bugging. It is an extremely frustrating game to set up and play due to the many bugs in the code. I have downloaded and applied one major fix, but my game still hangs partway through the first mission. I am running a pentium III 866 with 512 MB of ram and plenty of power with my ATI video card and ensoniq sound card, yet this game hangs repeatedly. Once I can get it to run, it appears that it has possibilities, but at the moment, it still needs work. Strangely, my son was able to load it on an older computer, and proceed further than I. For now, I must settle for playing the Deadly Dozen and Operation Flashpoint."
5,Great game,"This is the best WWII game I have played and is probably the best FPS I've played. It offers realism with it's graphics, gameplay and AI. You have a mulitude of weapons and varied missions. Sometimes you're shooting it out and sometimes your stealth, the game mixed it up well. The omaha beach level is great, the only drawback is that it plays out just like the beginning of saving private ryan.A word of caution: you must have an updated system to run this game with at least 32 mb of video. If you do not you could run into problems.Overall, it's a great game."
4,Saving Private Ryan on you desktop,"This game is awesome although some of the allies tend to run around in circles in tricky situations and get killed. The game follows the movie with a few extra sequences but all in all if you watched the flick, you will know what to do to succeed in the missions. I love the immersive environment and the music is awesome. The sounds add to the experience as well as the enemie AI. The Germans tend to be a little more formidable opponents than you are accustomed to seeing in these games. The battles are intense especially the beach landing at normandy (expect to not make it out of the LST). The only thing that seems to annoy people is the lack of blood. I for one am not bothered by it as the game is enjoyable enough to hold your interest even without the customary gore. I highly recommend this title and if you purchase it be careful of the snipers as they are deadly."
4,Rousing mainstream gospel,"This album combines great old-time vocals with what were near-contemporary instrumentals when it came out in 1994. It has plenty of drive, strong grooves, and feeling, ought to get you on your feet, spiritually at least! There are some moving ballads as well.The CD was produced by Melvin and Doug Williams of the Williams Brothers. Melvin joins Anjilena Cheairs on the vocals for ""Made Up My Mind."" Harvey Watkins, Jr. joins in with Rev. Andrew Cheairs on Watkins' own ""Alright."" The bulk of the lead vocals are from Reverend Cheairs, who with his family and musical friends is still a popular performer on the live circuit and has several other CDs out.The only reservation I have about this CD is the frequent use of electronic keyboards in what was and still is a popular style from the 80s: synthesized strings, drum machines and so on. Never did care much for that myself, but if you like that style or don't mind it too much, this is a fine album."
5,"Finally, a science book for everyone!","I have always been interested in biology and genetics. The problem with reading on these subjects, however, has generally been that they are written by scientists (apparently for other scientists). Matt Ridley has managed to write a book which is accessible to everyone. Whether you've never studied science or work in the field, Genome is a book you will enjoy. The explanations of scientific terms are clear and many examples are given throughout, so that you are never confused. You will be amazed at how much you will learn about the human body."
3,fun to read,"this was a great book to read because it is a compilation of vignettes. it's easy to read one or two in a sitting and then let it rest for a day, a week or a month. i wouldn't say that this book was a favorite of mine, but i'm glad i read it."
5,Outstanding,"Matt Ridley keeps it simple enough not to lose someone lacking a technical background. Extremely well written, I am eager to read more."
5,From Fruit Flies to Free Will,"I'm a physician with an addiction to science writing. Genome is a standout in the genre, deserving a place along side Consilience, The Elegant Universe, The Song of the Dodo, Chaos. Genome is not dry reporting, rendered free of passion. It combines scholarly reporting on the state of genomics with a lively and informed discussion of the implications of current findings. The writing is good-humored, self-effacing, accurate, and provocative. If you don't learn something from this book, you are in the noetic stratosphere; if you aren't challenged by some of Ridley's conclusions, you have petrification of your cerebrum. Ridley, you've done yourself proud!"
5,Far More Than Just About the Human Genome,"An absolute must read. If I could keep the knowledge gained from only ten books, this would be one of them. I learned far more than just human genetics. The obvious was covered, but by relating it to world history, behavior, psychology, anthropology and sociology, I have a far better understanding of the world and myself. The author's conversational and sometimes humorous approach made a difficult subject enjoyable while still highly informative. I did NOT find it ""boring"" or ""self-serving"" as some reviewers have suggesed."
2,Was Kurt Cobain Murdered? A Filmmaker Finds No Fire and Very Little Smoke,"In Kurt and Courtney, filmmaker British filmmaker Nick Broomfield investigates the persistent rumors that Courtney Love had Kurt Cobain murdered. There are a couple of good points in the film: viewers get to see the grungy world in which Kurt and Courtney lived and learn something about Courtney's twisted upbringing as the daughter of the Grateful Dead's one-time road manager. Unfortunately, there's nothing else here. Broomfield talks to seedy, down-and-outers who lie about how well they knew the couple. The film spins its wheels, going nowhere. Potential viewers can skip this one and lose very little."
1,Ludicrous evidence,"'Kurt and Courtney' is a documentary that tries to imply that Kurt Cobain, the lead singer and frontman of the grunge band Nirvana, might have been murdered rather than have committed suicide. It tires to suggest that Courtney Love, wife of Cobain, might have been somehow involved in the death. The evidence for this claim is so vague, illogical, and unfound that it makes the movie ludicrous. Some people will do anything to make a quick buck; that is why there is speculation behind Jim Morrison's death, Elvis, and many other famous people. Only for die-hard Nirvana fans, but even they might find the film to be rubbish."
4,Great Movie,"I am a huge fan of Kurt Cobain and Nirvana. This is a great doc. type of movie, if your like me and love Kurt Cobain, then you'll def. fall in love with this film. I've watched it about 4 times so far."
2,Disappointing,"With such prominently positive reviews, I might get some flack on this one. Maybe it's my fault for listening to the two best songs before the cd came out and I became way too excited. I recieved ""Hide Away"" from iTunes and instantly loved it. Then I heard ""Paralyzed"" on the radio, and loved that song as well. I was pumped for this band and this release. I went on my radio show asking my listeners to keep an ear out for this band. Other than those two songs, ""Are You Nervous?"" is a disappointment. The band doesn't keep up the energy, catchiness, or originality in any of the other songs and the music becomes, well, bland. It's honestly sad to see so much potential squandered. I will be looking forward to see the maturity in this band, however. Listen to ""Paralyzed"" and ""Hide Away"" and throw the rest out."
2,"Pretty good, but not the best Lem.","Stanislaw Lem is one of my favorite writers and this book is a lot of fun to read, but it isn't the best Lem book (not all of his books can be 5 star masterpieces). Read Cyberiad first (if you like short, interesting and funny tales) since this book seems a little like left-overs in comparison."
1,noise,this is nothing but a bunch of noise. just plain awful. like you are trapped in a washmachine.
4,An informative guide on Impressionism in the States,"When Europe and the West, including Russia were surged by new movements like Fauvism and Cubism, i thought that the spirit of Impressionism and its brevity were lost in the midst of the new trend in the art scene. Through this book i came to understand sequel story behind Impressionism when it was introduced to the States in the early 1900s. A must-read for any die-hard Impressionists out there who seeks to understand the culture and history set by the pioneering American Impressionists."
4,Excalibur (Blue-Ray),"The first time I saw this movie (years back) in cable I thought it was one pf the best King Arthur movies I've eve saw. I was surprised to see Patrick Steward and Liam Neeson in it.When I saw this was going to be launched in Blue-Ray it was no brainer. The movie is as expected... since is an old movie, the production is not very good: Terrible sound effects, terrible fighting scenes, not very good acting, etc....But I still think is a good King Arthur movie.I was strucked when I found out Morgana is actually Hellen Mirren!!. You can see her nowadays in RED with Bruce Willys and Morgan Freeman. She was H-O-T in her days.What it lacked this edition is some special features. Maybe interviews with the actors would be nice but nothing of that."
5,A Human's Tale.,"Well, we all know the plot of this one, but Boorman's sets and creative zeal make this telling of Camelot stand the test of time. It has to be one of the most beautiful and enchanting movies that I've ever seen. My father took me to it when I was a boy and it was the first R rated movie I ever saw--legally that is, we used to sneak in to the Rs after we would buy tickets for the PG ones. The characters of Merlin and Arthur could not be cast any better. Indeed, this particular Arthur is so kind, loyal, and true that it makes the Gueneviere/ Lancelot love affair quite painful. What this Arthur lacks in appearance he makes up for in countenance. As for Lancelot, I did not particularly like this version of him as the knights' locks painfully remind one of Tom Jones. Another incidental, the soundtrack...even more heavenly than the sets. A must see for a boy on the verge of manhood."
3,"Good movie, bad dvd","I dont know if many people ever notice this, but when Arthur pulls the sword out of the stone for the very first time: the picture shakes slightly! I thought it was just the dvd disc itself, I exchanged it, and the same scene shakes again! It only lasts from Arthur pulls the sword out of the stone, to where he tells his father to rise, and then finds out that ahis father is not really his father! Check this out, and tell me if its not true! Two dvd discs I have seen this happen, so its gotta be Warner Bros. problem!"
2,Excaliburr,"I like King Arthur, Merlin, Excalibur (etc.) stories. This one followed the basic story we all know; one good thing I can say about it is that it didn't have any of those stupid twists that ruin a good fairy tale.But this movie has less than good acting (besides Patrick Stewart, of course), directing, and special effects. It didn't portray the characters well at all.Next it's definitely R rated (in nowadays's standards), though it could have easily been modified/cut to be available to more audiences.And there isn't much humor. I remember only one part I enjoyed, and that part was only about 5 minutes. The rest of the humor had not much basis.To top it off it's very long - I have no problem with long movies, but to have to endure a long movie that is as bad as this is more than I can handle.I do not recommend this movie."
2,It'll do...,"I'm a big fan of the Arthurian Legends and this movie hurts me deep down.I kept thinking this would be a great movie and my mythology teacher even praised it before letting the class watch most of it but guess what folks?It seems my mythology teacher is just stupid!!!The people in my class were either making fun of the movie,sleeping or doing their homework because the movie seemed so lame.I tried to watch it but the facts weren't 100% correct as I was expecting,the actors were terrible and don't get me starting on the ""dazzling effects and time"" that they put into this movie.If you're bored one day then I dare you to try and watch this movie,otherwise forget it.The only good part of this movie was the character Morganna or Morgan le Fay as we normally call her."
2,Save Your Money,"The DVD gets two stars for setting, tackling the Arthur legend and trying to do it with some respect and restraint. However, beautiful scenery and excellent camera work can't negate a clumsy story treatment (granted Le morte d'Arthur is a rich work that is difficult to translate onto the screen, but perhaps an extra half hour to an hour wouldn't have hurt).Nigel Terry turns in a dismal performance. He seems horribly out of his depth through the entire picture except, perhaps, at the very end when Arthur dies; it's at this point he gives the character a maturity and dignity that is lacking in the adult Arthur throughout most of the film. Nicol Williamson looks like he's filling a contractual obligation and seems to play Merlin for laughs. The rest of the actors go about their parts in a pained, self-conscious fashion with embarrassing results.Buy Le morte d'Arthur (from Amazon, of course, if available) and read the legend, instead."
3,Hate the DVD case.,"The movie is one of the best ever made. Unfortunately it comes in a cardboard case, which means that if yours is broken or damaged, (like mine was) there is no way to replace or fix it. Excalibur the movie: Sublime, 5 Big Stars, the packaging? 1 star."
5,For lovers of legend and mythology,"I think this is one of the most well written and produced movies of all time. Of course, this is my opinion, but, if you've ever wondered about ancient civilizations and the origins of our culture you need this movie in your collection."
4,entertaining film,"I've long been an Arthur fan - enjoying his many incarnations thru-out literature and film - except for ""First Knight"" some crappy movie Farrah Fawlcetts and to some degree the recent ""King Arthur"".Boorman really captures the spirit of Arthur as he was depicted at the height of the Middle Ages rather than the Celtic warlord he might have really been.The acting is welldone particulary with Merlin and Arthur. The soundtrack was superb. Too often films including fantasy or sci-fi rely on modern soundtracks and horribly date a film - anybody cringe when they hear the soundtrack to ""Lady Hawk?""I've seen this film a dozen times and could easily watch it again."
4,"Good, But Is NOT A Straight Adaptation Of Sir Thomas Malory's Le Morte D'Arthur.","Note: I saw this movie with XFinity On Demand.This film, while excellent, does not really follow ""Le Morte D'Arthur"" by Sir Thomas Malory. for instance, Arthur does not sleep with Morgana, but his other half-sister Margawse (and that happens early on in the story). and the tale of Tristan & Iseult is' completely omitted, as is the fight between Sir Accolon & Arthur, the fight with the kings, Sir Balin/Sir Balan, etc. but it's a good movie. Just forget that Le Morte D'Arthur was ONE OF THE SOURCES used as the basis for this film. I've yet to see a film version that follows Sir Thomas Malory's Le Morte D'Arthur closely. Rated R, but should have been rated PG-13."
1,A Tempest in Teapot Armor,"Hamy, melodramatic, gratuitously violent, plotless, self-indulgent, historically ridiculous, and over long. I've tried to watch this teapot boiler once every decade and it still remains a crushing bore. If there had been advanced video games in the early 80's it should have been one. Cannot fathom what fans see in this thing other than middle earth fever for anything, and I mean anything, that smacks of sword and sorcery. A real clunker."
2,Great movie! Poor transfer,"I love the movie but the quality of the transfer was very depressing at times. There were numerous points in the movie where the grainy speckled image looked like a copy from a video tape and not what you would expect to get from a Blu-ray presentation. The whole movie was not grainy, some of the scenes where quite good, but some left me wondering if all the footage was transferred from the same source. Still a great movie!"
5,The world is under my control,this is a great game. its kinda the same as the last one but alot of new features if you liked the fist one you'll love this. It gets boring after awhile but you can come back later and it is just as fun. the only thing i dont like is that Yuri has to much power.
4,Fun Golf Game,"In this game you manage your own golf course/country club. You manage building your course holes. Starting out with a few to eventually you have a 18 hole course. You can create each hole to your liking with roughs, greens, sandtraps, water, fareways and tees. You can add cart paths to connect your holes. Also you can add houses to be occupied by celebrities. You can host tournaments to gain additional income for your course."
5,"Great Golf game, Great Sim game","I am a fan of the sim games but im not a real fan of the golf games, they're just to complicated and they dont make it fun. As difficult as designing everything about your course and playing it sounds, the creators have made this game simple and easy to enjoy...still keeping a lot of great features.If you liked rollercoaster tycoon you will like this because it has tons of features while keeping it simple.In fact this game is much easier to suceed in than rct.Overall I love this game and it's definately worth the $."
1,terrible,"I threw it away in the middle of the second song. Apparently it was going to incorporate remarks actually made by Bankhead, that would have been fun, but I didn't wait to find out, and it's gone now. $30-something shot to hell."
1,no star in this movie = one star,"pale performances of former movie legends, anemic plot, sticky-sweet soundtrack. even history lessons about joan were more fun. this ""the messenger"" copy is no match for luc besson's masterpiece."
1,questionable,"As you remember, I've complained about the product ordered as not good. I've returned it and that was the end of the story. Will I order again in the future? That remains to be determined."
3,"looks good, bad quality","for a fossil watch,,,its ok for a reg watch u could get a walmart its good, the chain link broke- 3 times now, and u cant take out links like a reg watch, u have to bring it to a store, and pay like $50- or at least we did. then the light that flashes the seconds stopped working and the battery isnt a normal one, you have to send it back to fossil to have them change it! its really incovient if u were a watch everyday but its ok if its for once in a while wear..."
5,One of Anne Perry's BEST!,"This was one of Perry's most clever, I thought. I missed Charlotte, who was not active in this investigation and Emily was on holiday but the intrigue of Pitt's murder case was excellent! This is an excellent read !"
4,Mas Alla De La Cumbre/over Ther Top (56-5-823),El libro es muy dinamico y motivador. Hace una introduccion excelente de los objetivos que nos podemos proponernos en la vida y avanza a lo largo del libro con propuestas de como obtener las metas y objetivos que nos hemos trazado. De los libros que he leido de autoayuda es excelente y su lenguaje fluido lo hace atractivo y uno de deja de leerlo hasta terminarlo. Lo recomiendo para toda aquella persona que quiere ver a la vida desde otra arista y que desea obtener lo maximo de si.
5,Andrea Wrinkle Release Eye Cream,"I use all of the Andrea line products; the serum, the wrinkle cream and the eye cream. I have used many expensive products that have not worked for me. The price is great! The product is great! You will not be disappointed."
5,Bravo to Direct Source Video,"At last a company that is dedicated to releasing pristine quality prints of exceptionally rare TV Movies of an era fondly remembered by viewers of the 1970s. Classic casts and interesting stories from the 'disaster' era.Along with Ants you will also find Tarantulas: The Deadly Cargo (1977) with Claude Akins, Pat Hingle, Charles Frank, Bert Remsen, Howard Hesseman and Charles Siebert. And to complete the trilogy, Terror Out Of The Sky (1978) a sequel to The Savage Bees (1976) which starred Ben Johnson, Gretchen Corbett, James Best, Horst Bucholz and Michael Parks. Terror stars stalwart Efrem Zimbalist Jr, Tovah Feldshuh, Dan Haggerty, Ike Eisenmann and Lonny Chapman. Buy all three and you will not be disappointed!"
5,Easy to understand yet full of information,"I love this book! Bob Berman manages to explain theories of the universe in easy-to-understand language without all the jargon that you find in a lot of books like this. When he does introduce new terms that most non-astronomers won't understand, he uses simple everday examples to explain them (like comparing the process of ""entropy"" to a glass of club soda with ice.) The information is interesting and thought-provoking. You don't have to be a rocket scientist to understand this book... but you may know as much as a rocket scientist when you're done!"
1,A five cent book in a twenty-five dollar wrapping.,"If Bob Berman is your idea of a celebrity and you really care about his youthful escapades, his early girlfriends, his personal thoughts, etc, you might get something from this book. If you liked his earlier book, Secrets of the Night Sky, as I did, then you are bound to be disappointed by this sorry attempt at a follow up. There is no substance to the book aside from the widely advertised ""how far away is the horizon?"" question. (The answer is: square root of altitude in feet times 1.23 equals distance to horizon in miles). That's it, the rest is padding and pure pap. There are also several blatant errors in the text. There is no theme and after reading it I had all the substance I could have gotten from an old copy of ""People"" magazine. Save your money."
3,DIY,"ORIGINALLY BOUGHT FOR BUMPER MOUNT. ENDED UP PURCHASING A FRAME MOUNT. THIS BUMPER MOUNT IS WELL MADE, SO I KEPT IT FOR FUTURE USES."
2,what happened?,"Richard Matheson is one of my favorite authors of all time, but I have to say that his last couple books and this one in particular were very disappointing.I think he has gotten lazy. Richard Matheson has forgotten how to write anything but dialogue and minimal descriptions of what is going on. This is not good writing. This book is very short and very simplistic. Coming from someone who has produced some amazing books in the past, it leaves me wondering what happened?The overall story could have been great, but no time was taken to develop it. It could have been expanded a lot to make it much more interesting. The parts that were supposed to be scary were not built into at all, leaving absolutely no feeling of suspense or tension whatsoever.The only way that this book was even worth the time was because it took less than two hours to read...and about that long to write from the looks of it."
4,A short good novel,"When I read the dedication and first chapters of this book I was under the impression that it was intended to give women a moral boost. In the end I don't think he accomplished this goal, unless you believe Frankenstein is a treaty on humanities best attributes. Nonetheless it is a very creative novel that keeps readers attention to the very end."
4,Great Movie,"I got this item because I loved the movie. Worth keeping to see over and over again.I got good service and the item came in the shape it was to be in, ( NEW )."
4,Limestone Cowboys,"This is one of the best road pictures ever made. With elements of realism, art style cinematography and a great sounding psychedelic country rock soundtrack that drives this film along the two lane highways of the southwest and deepsouth in this modern day western from the late 60's.Truly an american original film masterpiece and worth owning for your film collection."
4,Nightcrawlers live forever.,"There are no easy riders, for we all die the death at the hands of the living. But it is the night Lords who give everlasting undeadness, and prolonged existence. This movie fails to show that in it's hunt for freedom. Fools. There is no freedom in the day. IT IS IN THE NIGHT!!! Their deaths lead to nothing but repugnance of the living. Join us, oh seekers of the easy rider. We fly, and nightcrawl. Leave your helmuts behind."
3,Easy Rider.,"This movie may not appeal to everyone, but it definitely lives up to the title. It doesnt reach out and grab you and force you to pay attention, but it's not boring either. It is pretty relaxing to watch. There really isn't much of a story, but overall, the movie is interesting."
3,HEADACHE!,"I don't know what to say. In my last life I was Marrianne Faithful (Slut to the Rock Stars!), so I geuss I should like this movie but I really don't. I really don't understand what's going on. And the bizarre cineamtagrophy just gives me a headache. Music is OK. Why did they get blown away? I really don't get it? It just seems sad without reason."
2,Not Happy,"The dvd that I ordered was supposed to be NEW not USED. After all that is what I paid for. I received the USED DVD no plastic wrappomg, this DVD is a Christmas gift. False advertising and poor business."
5,Perfection,"Yes, the editing is flawed or whatever, but it does not detract form this masterpiece. I compare this movie with ""Do The Right THing"". It takes you into the life of some characters you don't know, makes you see it their way and kills them off for no reason other than prejudice. Some say it's slow. Well slow down with it. As for Jack, I think his character is the worst. That bad accent stunk compared to the believable characters of Fonda and Hopper. Forget your politics in this. Forget what you think of drugs. This is about bigotry and hatred. ""Normal people see freedom and it makes them scared."" ""It don't make them runnin' scared."" It speaks to any generations disaffected youth. If it's 60's longhair or an 80's punk or a 90's goth."
3,"Great, but confusing","I enjoyed this book a lot, but the way that the auther writes is confusing.It was interesting,about a girl named Velvet and her horse, The Piebald. They won the Grand National. I liked her idea about cutting out horses from magazines and taping them on cardboard. Now, I do it too. Still, it's mind boggling.Sometimes, the characters aren't formally introduced, they just seem to jump in. Also, it's too jumpy, from one scene to another. But it's a great book for horse lovers like me, besides its flaws."
3,"Although Velvet wins the race, this book lost the chase.","To Velvet life was horses. The smell of the hay and the feeling of running through the wind. But life as a butchers daughter was nothing like that, nothing special, nothing out of the ordinary; in fact, nothing exciting ever happened. Velvet never gave up hope, and that is the magic of the story, however the author does not get around to the exciting point until the 3rd quarter of the book. This made me almost fall asleep with bordem. Being the type of reader that skims books I also found that the formal writing and slow to move plot made me put this book down many times. I also did not think that Velvet's personality was anything like her actions. I also can not relate much to horses so the whole magic of the story to me was lost. So as I said before, Velvet may have won the race, but this book lost the chase."
4,"What did ""they"" do with history?",This is so very different than the romanticed history version. How long I have believed a historic fairy tale--too long!
2,kindle version errors,Unfortunately the kindle version of this excellent book is riddled with errors. This is made even more frustrating by the fact that the kindle version is actually more expensive than the paper copy.
3,Starting To Lose Interest,"The first two were pretty good, and while I am still curious how things will end I wont be so quick to grab the next one in the series. I will be reading a few others first. My biggest issue is that nothing really ever happens and the women are all pretty much the same character with a few differences here and their. The men are written well and have different personalities, but the women are kind of boring to read through. That's not me being sexists I just feel that Jordan, while an excellent writer, doesn't do a good job writing women. That's my two cents."
5,WOW!! I can't see any other way to put it.,The Dragon Reborn is an astounding sequel to The Great Hunt. The main characters discover who they are in this novel. The power behind the whole quest is a genius at work.RIVOTTING!!!
2,Terrible,"I read the Eye of the World and the Great hunt and I figured this would be as good...but oh my god was I wrong. After reading the entire book, who can tell me what actually develops? NOTHING! There was no point to this book. I could've skipped the entire thing and just gone on to the next one, because nothing important happens except that Rand gets Callandor, which has never even been mentioned before this book. And how the hell does Rand even find out about Callandor? Nothing is explained in this book, and its just terrible. I expected more out of Jordan, and this book has just killed my interest in Wheel of Time."
3,Dragon Reborn is okay,"I think this book is my one of my least favorite of the series (I've only read to the fifth). It seemed to have the least to do with the character that the whole series is about, Rand. He is written like a secondary character here, and the parts about his chase get dull. Overall, I would still recommend reading this book. I still believe the Wheel of Time series is my favorite of all time.The Dragon Reborn, by Robert Jordan, is the third book in the series, The Wheel of Time. It tells of Rand Al'thor, thought to be the Dragon reborn, but he denies it and eventually winds up running off to the Stone of Tear to fulfill a prophecy to prove to himself what he is. Perrin Abyara and Moraine take to tracking. Perrin is now becoming a ""wolf-brother"" and trying to cope with it. All the while, Nyneve and Elayne leave the tower not long after coming and have an adventure of their own. The ending is the best part, I suggest you read this book."
4,Good.......Really good,"Man, it seemed like Robert Jordan was in a hurry to finish this one. He still had the action and adventure, but it seemed like he put too much detail into things that didn't matter. Like another reviewer said he described every bit of clothing that some one was wearing and then blurred some of the charachters together so they seemed to have the same personalities. This would have merrited a nine but I had to drop it a notch because he really kind of excluded my favorite character Rand until the end. In doing this he brought Nyneave & Eugwene up to main characters in the saga. I still recommend this series to everyone"
4,very good,"Jordan has reached the peak of the story in this one, it starts out fast and keeps going about the same pace, but you can tell that the story will be slowing soon, but it's still is a wonderful read the characters are gaining more and more personality, and they seem like they could be real people, you find yourself wondering if this whole ordeal couldn't have really happened in some point in time."
5,"Mat, Perrin and ""The Girls"" Do Their Thing Well","Just finished it last night. This is an exemplary book. It's filled with action, development of the several characters' personal relationships and qualities, and humor. In ""Dragon Reborn"" Rand takes off on his own not only to meet what appears to be his destiny - drawing Callandor and thus demonstrating he is the Dragon Reborn - but also to lead enemies away from his friends. Mat, Perrin, Egwene, Nynaeve and Elayne are caught up in the swirls of fate or chance, and are propelled toward Tear, too. They participate in terrific action as they all encounter minions of the Dark One. Mat stands out as he shows how brave, resourceful and downright funny he is. The ""girls"" and Perrin also show that they are courageous and steadfast, and Nynaeve and Egwene begin to strongly develop their skills or talents. Perrin is falling in love!? This is fun reading. Get it now."
2,Worst of the lot,"I've read all of the Wheel of Time books so far, and The Dragon Reborn is by far the worst of the lot. The story is boring, and all too similar to the first two (main characters are seperated, have to make their own ways to Wherever City). Really only the very beginning and the very end make this book enjoyable. The sad part is, if you're a Wheel of Time fan...you have to read it. Otherwise you can't read the rest of the books...But don't worry. The Shadow Rising, the next in the series, is one of the best books ever written by any author; it's faster-paced, has more action, more...storyline, more EVERYTHING. Almost as though RJ new he had to apologize for this waste of a gazillion words..."
2,Where oh where has our hero gone?,"So Rand is the Dragon Reborn, and this is the title of this book, but he nearly completely disappears from our story? Again, another 700 page book needing a serious editor to cut it in half. And for people who supposedly love each other, it's amazing how shabbily the characters can treat each other. Too many characters to focus well on any single story, it's easy to forget what's going on or what has previously happened. As I've said before: these books need a good synopsis and Glossary. All that said, when there is action, it is good rousing action with world-shaking possibilities. But still not a Tolkein."
2,seems to be in it for the money,"when i first started reading this series,i thought id found a good story,but after reading the third book in this epic journey,i noticed,a obvious pattern,of building to a climax,and making the last 20 pages exciting,while leaving the rest of the book up to that page simple.jordan's a smart writer,but seems to be writing,only to build for another book."
4,Performances better than the recording,"Unfortunately this CD was made from the Australian TV tapeing of The Merry Widow, a shame that the microphones are not of high enough quality to capture the really fine performances, it is hard enough to understand what is being sung when properly recorded let alone when the equipment stinks, however if you enjoy Joan Southerland as much as I do you can overlook the flaws in the recording and just get carried away with the voice, it would be nice if a libretto had been included, a rarity today, that used to be common in the era of the LP"
5,Lots of good advice!,"This is an older book that has been digitized, but it is still highly relevant. The author makes lots of interesting points and is quite inspiring. He really makes one think about how one spends one's time. Potentially a life changing book!"
3,Eye opening,"This book brought fresh new perspectives to my outlook of time, however I may have spent more time trying to translate the extravagant language than understanding his points."
2,Boring,"I was so bored with this book, I quickly turned from reading to scanning for something to grab my attention."
4,Not bad!!!,"I've been playing the Madden NFL series for a long time and the 2002 version is significantly better than the 2001 version. The improved graphics and gameplay (A.I is smarter now) makes it fun and challenging. The scoreboards in the stadium now reflect actually time left in quarter, the actual score and other stats of the down.What was disappointing was the fact that they used very much the same sound bites from the 2001 version so the color commentary is boring to someone who has played previous versions. Sometimes the color commentary makes no sense whatsover.Overall, a good upgrade but beware of the system requirements. You need RAM and a good graphics card loaded with RAM as well."
4,GREAT AND OK,"This game is pretty fun! I mean it isn't very realistic, but it's very fun. I like the create a team mode. I created tons of teams like the Saiyans, Meatballs, Gods, etc. I can control every attribute of the player and lots more for each team. The scores are crazy though. I beat the Raven 250 to 0! And the Vikings 238 to 14! Using the Saiyans, my best team. Better than every other! Here are their ratings: Overall: 99, Offense: 99, Defense: 99, and Special Teams: 99! A lot better than the real teams. This game is a lot of fun!"
3,"Rams 56, Ravens 54","This games looks great, but the AI, at least on the offense, sucks... I can the run shotgun formation, deep outs, roll right and score 56 points on the Ravens. Make some freakin' adjustments on defense A.I.! The Ravens just blitz blitz blitz. They come back and score on long pass plays, no matter if I double team, man, blitz, whatever. It is a matter of who scores first.It is tough to run of course, even with Marshall F. I do admit that I was going against the Ravens D."
4,The BEST Madden Yet!,This game is lots of fun. Madden and Summeral get kinda annoying after about 2 quarters because they just repeat the same kinda stuff. I mean... I was on 1st and 10 and Madden said it was 4th and inches. I was like cmon what kinda [junk] is that. The create-a-team is cool. They could really use more logos and different helmet styles. They could also add in the sleeves options like on playstation. The graphics are priceless. The hits make you feel like ur there. Overall i gotta give this game a 4. If you wanna buy... GET IT!!!!
2,It's ok,"This game has wonderful graphics. The franchise mode is also very good. I like the way players can get better or worse in their ratings at the end of the season. But, their are some aspects of the game that do need help. The game can get boring only after playing about 2 or 3 games. The annoucers are lame, and don't even know what ther are talking about. Also, the gamplay is slow. Madden is very realistic but needs to add some arcade style in it. That is about the only problem. It is fun to go chat with other people in the online lobby and play them. But, while playing another person online the game goes very slow with many bumps and does not work well. Plaus, the update option allows your rosters to be up to date and that can help you. You will not want to buy the new version just because of the old rosters. I rate this game a 2 1/2."
3,Entertaining story with good cast,I doubt that much of this is historically accurate but maybe that doesn't matter. Billy the Kid and several other fellows do lots of shooting and riding as they battle some guys who are much more corrupt than they are. It is especially hard for them to find their way after the lose the father figure who had been looking after them.I could have done without some of the weird slo-mo and the silly peyote scene.
3,Young Guns,"Typical bubble-gum meets ""old western"" hollywood. I wouldn't have been suprised if the chracters starting calling each other 'dude' in this spoof. However, there are a few moments when this film really delivers."
5,Jennifer,"this show is an amazing show about a teen stuck in our time and getting through high school with his futuristic gadgets the stars including: Ricky Ullman, Amy Bruckner, and Alyson Michelka all fit together as a great team."
3,"nothing, if not unique","This film should get credit simply for the fact that it was made at all then for whether or not it's any good. I'd've loved to've been in the room when they pitched it to Connery, telling him he'd spend the entire picture running around in orange underwear with many of the strangest looking topless women England has to offer.Connery bullies around raping and causing problems for everyone who crosses his path and somehow manages to come out on top at the end. It has to been seen, to be believed. I recommend it not because it's any good (because it's near horrendous), but because it's unparalleled in its vision and storytelling."
4,Once was not enough...,"The local movie reviewer said, ""There's a new way to spell trash - Z-A-R-D-O-Z."" Having already become very familiar with this reviewer's whacked out judgement - and his tendency to give away the endings and punch lines, I read no further and headed for the theatre.I was confused and enchanted by my first viewing of this film. I went back four or five times (hey, it cost only $2 then!) before its run ended. Every time I saw it again, new layers of symbolism occurred to me. (And, god, didn't Sean Connery look great in a pigtail!)I recently made my husband watch the movie. He didn't get it. At all. But then, he doesn't think Dilbert is funny, either.I'm glad ZARDOZ is available on video so that I can keep watching it - again - and again..."
4,A Truly Strange Vision,"Loved by some, hated by others, ultimately you may find it hard to fathom on a single viewing. If you can watch it while ""properly stimulated"" you may enjoy it more. Boorman's work is certainly great evidence for his talent - this one may make you wonder. But ultimately it is a compelling and original vision of the future, and a fascinating twist on the desire for immortality. The dialogue really stretches your patience at times, but after all it is SF. The revelation about the title is wonderful. A great companion piece to Logan's Run."
2,Inaccuracies,"I can only comment about the Evans-Sontag portion of the book, a subject which I have researched extensively. This chapter was riddled with inaccuracy. One photo of the wounded John Sontag was captioned, ""John Sontag shortly after his death."" In fact, Sontag lived a considerable time after this was snapped, through surgeries, and died later of gangrene. I could give several other examples. The book is not without merit, since there were interesting photos I hadn't seen before to accompany the story. For that reason, I give it two stars. But the text of this chapter doesn't reflect serious research, in my opinion."
5,Excellent Quality andf Value,I originally thought palm nailers would be pretty useless tools. Boy was I mistaken. This tool drives nails in a few seconds and is so easy to use. The chuck holds the nail magnetically and pressure from your palm activates it. It manages to drives the nails straight in.I used this tool on Simpson Stong Ties on a decking project where each Strong Ties takes numerous nails. It was a lifesaver. (or an arm saver!!)At the price and free freight this tool is excellent value.It comes no frills. (just the nailer and instruction book). If you want a fancy case and accessories like a leather cover you'll pay much more.In summary this tool is excellent quality and value.
3,just to have,"this arrived today, way faster than I expected, good job guys. Bought this because it is reportly a great unit at a very good price. Just bought it to have and because reports were so good on it. well write opinion if I every use it.........."
2,"Fun for Kids, but not so much for those over 10yrs old","I do remember liking this game as a kid. But now it's very hard for me to play. The game is full of bugs, is slow, the character's mouths don't move when they talk, jumping is awkward, and overall, the graphics are terrible by today's standards. The only level I really liked is when Harry is under the invisibility cloak and has to go past all of these obstacles and past Filch and Mrs. Norris. And the flying I liked when i first played this.Fortunately the next game, Chamber of Secrets, surpasses this one by several hundred miles.Do I recommend this game? only if those under ten are going to be the ones playing it."
3,Seems slapped together,"I have only seen a bit of the game we bought for my son. The graphics are subpar and you can only control the characters using the keyboard or mouse, not a game controller. I expected better gameplay from the folks who bring us the NFL, NBA, and NHL games."
4,Cool... until you get to the end.,"This game is awesome! It's really fun and it doesn't freeze like Prisoner of Azkaban and chamber of Secrets. It's really fun and easy... until you get to the end. Right after you sneak down from the tower after delivering Norbert, the game is almost over. They don't mention going into the Forbidden forest at all. Right after it turns into a short cut scene and then suddenly you're in the Forbidden Corridor. And what's with the chess part? You move Harry around until somehow you get across. Another part I don't get is that when you get to the chess part, Ron says he defeated most of the chess pieces. Ron must be really talented if he can defeat almost an entire board of chess pieces in 20 SECONDS. And the end where you have to knock 4 pillars onto Voldemort, then you just Flipendo the mirror until somehow you defeat Voldemort. But aside from those ""minor"" setbacks, this game is great."
2,Pretty sub-par game,I think this game is pretty bad. There are too many problems that I am going to list here:*Not enough save points*Hard to move your wand around to cast the spell at the enemies*Everything is an adventure they never let u relax*In quidditch it is kinda hard to catch the stupid snitch*sometimes the game will go really slow with older systemsAlso you can't explore and this game isn't that good anyway.
3,Fun for Potter Fans!,"Speaking as a fan of Harry Potter, this game is tremendous fun! The graphics are well done, and the level of immersiveness is great. As an experienced gamer, the game is pretty easy, but that's okay with me. It's lots of fun to play this game! The controls are a little frustrating, and surprisingly, you do not have as much control over this as you might think (the game is based on the Unreal graphics/game engine, which provides extensive control customization already - why take it away???)."
5,"QUIDDITCH, HERE I COME!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!","I might get this for Christmas!!!!!!!!!An' WHOOOOOOO I can't wait!!!!!!!!!!!!I've read all 4 books.An' I'm reading the whole series at school again!Anyway,wonder what Fluffy (the three-headed dog) looks like?I also wonder what the Sorcercer's Stone looks like?!!?The Quidditch Graphics are probably GREAT!The Snitch must be HARD to catch!! (...)"
3,Terribly Glitchy,"I loved this game so much when I was younger! :D Fred and George were hilarious, as always, and I really liked performing charms. The only problem is that it was so glitchy. It'd freeze for long periods of time with the sound still going, or vice versa, and it got so horrible I couldn't tolerate it anymore. Maybe it'd be better on a newer computer, but I can't try it on my Mac. :'C"
3,could've been better,"the first hp computer game was a bore (on playstation and on the computer) the second was much better on playstation 2, not so hot on the comp. they could have come up with better ideas... the games are pretty boring and repetitive. i don't know... there are smart people out there... spice these games up a bit."
4,Great game!,"This is a really fun game if you like Harry Potter.It is kind of hard,though. Game tip: Put the game on auto jump,it makes the game a lot easier. You get to play Harry Potter and travel through Hogwarts doing different types of challenges for your classes and friends. There are lots of secret passageways and surprises. Get this game if you like Harry Potter."
3,Long and time consuming,"This game is pretty good, hard at some points, it seems like a big maze you just can't leave and you don't know if your going the right way, but maybe I just don't play enough games. It's extreamly long. Like at least 10 hours of playing. I liked it, overall, and I played twice. This is a great game for people who spend their days sitting on their commputer all day."
2,Harry's Fun Adventure,"This book is about a boy named Harry. Harry is living with his aunt and uncle, because his mom and dad died. One day a letter came saying that Harry was welcome to a magic school called Hogwarts. Harry's mom and dad were wizards. That is why Harry was welcome to the school. Will he go to Hogwarts? I dislike this book, because I do not believe in witchcraft and magic. If you like magic read it. Otherwise I like it."
1,STUPID,"I thought from the back of the book that it wouldn't be that bad, but the author didn't give enough detail into the whole Hunter thing and there were more inconsistancies that made the book terrible. I laughed at some of the dialog, but there wasn't enough to keep the book going."
4,HahHAhaaha,"Yeah, if you even know the games it's worthwhile. So, if you aren't familiar with the games, probably best to pass it on."
1,Something the publisher should know,"I was looking at this book and considering buying it. I wanted a good look at a couple of pages inside to see if it was the right book for us. Unfortunately, the publisher has requested that NO inside pages be shown! Even when I click on ""surprise me"" there are no samples of the pages inside. How on earth can I make an informed decision if I have no information? This lack of information makes me suspicious. Is there a reason why they don't want pages shown? Maybe the book isn't very good.So, publisher, because of the lack of information I am not purchasing this book. Something to consider. You could have made a sale."
3,"Maybe wheat- and dairy-free, but NOT gluten-free!","I had high hopes for this book, but they were quickly dashed when I discovered that every single recipe relies on barley flour. What's the point of wheat-free recipes that still contain gluten? I would not have bought this off a store shelf had I been able to leaf through it more thoroughly.I've given it three stars because I'm sure it's great for people who don't have a problem with gluten, but I think the authors and Amazon should make it very clear that this is NOT a gluten-free cookbook."
4,Surprisingly Good,"At first I thought it was going to be a waste of money, but it is a refreshing take on the genre. It had all of the elements for a good vampire movie yet it is very unique. Don't expect it to capture you right away, it is a slow build up but worth the wait."
3,It was ok,"This is a slow movie when you start going. It's hard to determine what is going on actually. It's not overly entertaining. It looks at the human side of being a vampire. Although they never inform you as to how he became a vampire. He just is one. Acting was so so. Would I view it again, probably not. Its a one time view movie. It served its purpose. Next! Not upset about it. It's not a blockbuster by no means."
3,Not a 5 Star Movie,"Whenever some people discover that a movie is an indie film quite often they relent to having not so stringent of expectations for the film. This can leave a lot of room for error and still have many people giving the film decent reviews. But this time it has gone too far!! 5 STARS?? Really? No, the movie did not suck but it does not warrant 5 Stars. Wait for it to show up on Netflix do not pay to watch it."
5,great game,"if your a car nut like me, this game is for you. you race to get money and to earn a rep. everything you do is online so you are all ways interacting with people. have you been dreaming about that 70 cuda you always wanted, no own it and build her up to be a mean street machine."
1,This game is basically worthless.,EA no longer has Motor city online. So if you are planning to play it. You better find a server to play it on first.
1,Don't waste your money,"This game was fun at first, but then it got repetitive, boring and dull. The beta testers all have the nice cars, and as a newbie it will take you ages to be able to afford anything decent. Plus it's just like the Need for Speed games, which I have never liked. The initial price of the game is just like any other computer game, but then you have to also pay each month to continue playing! There is no offline single player mode, so you either pay or you don't play. For the initial price it's worth it, but when you add on the monthly fee it's definately not. Needless to say I won't be buying another EA computer game for a LONG while. Don't waste your time and money on this game unless you absolutely love classic cars and don't mind wasting money each month to play a game that is mediocre at best."
4,Jedi Starfighter and Vulture Droid,"This Jedi Starfighter and Vulture Droid will probably take 45 minuites to build if you're a average builder. The Jedi Starfighterhas really beutiful yellow colors and the flaps on the wings can go up and down. And it's not that fragile but the Vulture Droid...It's kinda easy to break if you're touching and playing with the wings and you'll be so ticked off when you'll half to re build the wings back onto the droid so that's why I usualy put the Droid somwhere safe and don't play with it, I only play with the Starfighter because it doesn't break all the time. So I suggest you get this really cool Jedi Starfighter with Vulture Droid."
5,Diminutive Dachshund.,"Just right as a collar pin, and could be used as a tie tack, for a dog fancier. It's a perfect rendering in miniature of the famous doggie that's 'Two dogs long, and half a dog high'!"
4,ABSOLUTELY FANTASTIC,i have watched this concert 100 times and i never thought it could get any better but it has this great release on dvd is a must for any elvis fan the sound picture quality are superb the only thing i wasnt happy with is that they have cut some songs out thats the reason i have give it 4 stars
5,Alaska is not for sissies,"The Alaska that Peter Jenkins found is not the Alaska you see from the cruise ships that ply the Inside Passage in the summer. Jenkins looked past ""tourist"" Alaska and discovered the heart and soul of our biggest state.The people that Jenkins writes about are as rugged as the Alaskan climate in the winter. These people who inhabit Alaska are tough and bold. Alaska is no place for sissies.From the majestic mountains and glaciers, to land-fast ice and floating icebergs, to the abundant wildlife that teems both on land and in the water, each chapter tells a fascinating story of life in Alaska.Peter Jenkins says, ""No picture can truly recreate its vastness, its severity, and its profound beauty"", but he does paint for the reader an unforgettable portrait of Alaska."
2,downhill since the last book,I bought and loved Jenkins' A Walk Across America. I couldn't get enough so I bought this book. This book reads very bland. There is not much excitement and not much insight. I couldn't finish it was so boring.
5,True Alaska,"No words can adequately describe this book. Peter Jenkins' book is the closest one can get to being in Alaska without the cost of an airline ticket, lodging, etc. He captures the true essence of Alaska and the many who reside there. Forget the cruises to the inner passage, Jenkins' book will expose you to more about Alaska than a week-long voyage. He captures the stories, legends and eccentricities about Alaska in a way no other author has. I highly recommend ""Looking for Alaska"" and any other of Jenkins' books!"
5,Peter (Walk Across America) Does It Again!!,"Have you ever wanted to go to Alaska? Maybe even stay long enough to actually get to know some of the people? Meet come interesting characters? Here's you chance to go, even if it is a vicarious visit. Read the Seward Log, and keep track of the moose and bears visiting in the neighborhood. Visit with a family who live out in the wilderness- every board and nail for their home had to be brought in by snow machines. Ride along in the sled of one of Alaska's top mushers, Jeff King, as he prepares for the Ididarod. Meet Hobo Jim who wrote the song, I Did I Did the Ididarod Trail! And more!! There's only one problem... the book ends entirely too soon!!!"
3,dubliners,"I would have liked to know that the quality of the used book was as poor as it is - very disappointing. Certainly readable, but as my daughter said, ""You paid money for that""!!!! Will not buy used books in the future."
4,"Well done, entertaining and kid-friendly","This video provides kids 3-8 a great introduction to foreign language. Using a kid-relevant approach, this video makes learning a foreign language fun for the whole family!"
4,GOOD MATERIAL TO TEACH SPANISH!,"Kids really enjoy being able to see what they're learning and they make you interact with them and the music. Great to use with teaching purposes for toddlers (2-5), if you really want your kids to have an easy start to a foreign language."
3,Good facts but not much story,"Forgive me if I forget details, as it's been a year since I read this book. Eisenberg presents pretty straight facts and so forth, as far as I know (unlike ""Seabiscuit"" which has a bit of embellishment in some places), but it is not very exciting reading. Thankfully, it is not as big a book as ""Seabiscuit"". It's so-so story-telling and seems to drag on in some ways. I got some info out of it, but that's about it. Nothing against ""the Dancer"" (that was one annoying thing - Eisenberg always referring to the horse as ""the Dancer"" as if it was cute, but it was monotonous and pretentious after 10x on 1 page, with no pronouns or actual name used), but the writing just doesn't quite thrill me."
4,pretty good,"not as brilliant as nack's secretariat, the best sports bio ever written...but definitely not as uselessly poor as 'horse of a different color' by village idiot squires, or 'three strides before the wire' by mitchell, or 'citation' by georgeff.the author doesn't get too in-depth of the life of native dancer, which i suppose is a problem with any book written years after the events took place (this is a particularly bad problem in the citation book). the author seems to continually re-introduce doubt about the superiority of native dancer, by writing what others have opined, namely that native dancer didn't often win crushingly by many lengths (like secretariat's belmont) and that he seemed to have a worrying tendency to pull up once he was ahead in the stretch. but all in all, this is a fine bio on a fabulous racehorse with only one loss in a magnificent career (the second-best gray horse ever (no.1 the wonderhorse spectacular bid))."
4,Fond childhood memory,I still remember this book from when I last read it when I was about 10 years old (I read it two or three times back then). I was pleased to see I could buy a copy used.
4,After playing for a coupe of months!,"I still don't regret having bought this game...I keep playing and playing. I still like the new passing and shooting, and the overall ball interaction...much more realistic. The only downfall sI have found were as follows: shooting flanks (its hard to tell which direction you are shooting in...it might point 90degrees but actually shoots 120...shooting anywhere but infront of goal; AI in Pro mode...computer opponents AI much to perfect...but what makes it worse is taht yoru own players start being dumb and not playing as intelligently and aggressive as in amateur...please AE create a patch for that. Those would be the biggest problems I have found besides the increased difficulty of shot aiming in general. Other than that almost everything is a step up in a new direction. If teh above mentioned points could be fixed this could be come an increadible game."
3,Soft Core Sadism?,"As a dirty movie, God, does this thing deliver. There's an over top sexaul encounter staged about every ten minutes or so, and they're all shot like shampoo commercials, with lots of soft light and sensual music. You'll be so caught up in watching it that the iniatial nature of the relationship being protrayed won't bother you until the end of the film. Then you'll begin to wonder: should this kind of sadism be so erotic and glamourous? Should this kind of disrespect to women be so enjoyable to watch?"
1,Maybe it was good then....,"Dont waste your time watching this movie... this is so typical of a 80's movie, bad acting, very stupid story line. The ending is pointless and at no point in this movie does it make any sense what the hell is going on. If you like watching soft porn and crappy acting, this is the movie for you..."
3,Hooooooottttttttttt! But ridiculous lol,Oh my...mickey rourke is sexy in this movie. That grin of his. Damn lol! Very hot! This is one of those movies that make you squirm in your chair while you watch it lol. Then you watch the storyline and you are like DAMN what in the hell is she doing with him? lol. Very messed up romance. BUT lol exxxtreeemely sexy even still :)
1,review,I was unable to play this DVD as it was not playable in Australia. They knew they were posting to Australia and should have let me know

4,9 1/2 Weeks,I enjoyed 9 1/2 Weeks. I found it to be very sexy and quite erotic. The kitchen scene was delightfully yummy! The chemistry between Mickey Rourke and Kim Basinger was absolutely steamy. A very good and spicy couples movie.
3,Zzzzzzzz,"Elizabeth (Kim Bassinger) works at a trendy art gallery in New York City. She meets John (Mickey Rourke), a mysterious, wealthy stranger, and they begin a torrid affair. He's into game playing; he likes to tell her what to do and she does it, even when it scares her. He wants to control her in every way and she lets him...for nine and a half weeks.When this came out in 1986, it was considered shocking; today one can see almost this much sensuality on TV and certainly in many movies so its impact has diminished. The steamy, dangerous, erotic night scenes contrast nicely with the cold, sterile day scenes of Elizabeth's work. The photography is striking with costumes and sets in stark black and white and close-ups designed to heighten our sensory awareness. Bassinger and Rourke are well-cast but I didn't care about or like either of them. Their situation seemed sad and repellent.The movie could certainly be titillating, but I found it upsetting and scary and sometimes even boring."
2,That birds and bees joke,"9 1/2 WEEKS reminded me of that birds and bees joke. That's where the Dad told the son about sex in very graphic terms, finishing by asking, ""Have you got any questions?"" Then the kid says, ""Yeh, Dad. How do you keep from laughing?"" Well, this movie was a little bit funny about the sex parts. A guy on a bar stool sort of blushed when Basinger and Rourke engaged in some foreplay at the bar. Mostly, however, the movie ""story"" was demeaning to women. It was not entertaining. It was boring. I give it two stars because of the locations. The movie shows off a side or two of New York City, and the evening photography was excellent."
1,The perfect cure for insomnia...,Has the directing/acting quality of a bad porn flick without the porn. Absolute garbage.
4,excellent movie for stimulating sexual energy,One of my all time favorites! Very appealing and definitely puts you in the right kind of mood!:)
3,Mickey & Kim are Hot & Steamy,"This was far better than Wild Orchid, but along the same line. Done in better taste but still had no real story line. This was a very popular movie in the day. Years later...I can only say it was popular for it's light ""erotica"" scenes. But...it's probably still a ""classic"" for it's day."
4,A little dated still worth watching,This was a stroll down memory lane for me as I saw it in theatre when it first came out in the late 80's. Held up well over time and is tastefully done.
2,A major problem...,"The acting and script are EXCELLENT. But there are some ""minor"" issues that some people may have problems with, such as baptism that is not immersion and hinting at the possibility of married people still being married in heaven (see Matt. 22:23-30). Furthermore, it is a little vague on exactly who is going to heaven and who is not. And there is a MAJOR PROBLEM: at one point in the movie Peter receives a message from Jesus that includes a statement along the lines of ""or I will come back and be crucified again."" This is a major theological problem, as the one crucifixion of Christ was sufficient (see Hebrews chapter 10). Such a shame for an otherwise excellent movie."
2,ONE OF THE WORST BIG BUDGET FILMS EVER MADE,"This movie has the worst acting I've ever seen. Robert Taylor, Peter Ustinov, etc. couldn't act thru a paper bag. The sets and the color are some of the finest I've ever seen, but with 2011 eyes, this is a joke. Ben Hur blows this movie out of the water."
3,NOT A WIDESCREEN FILM,"It bares repeating that this film was made before the invention of Cinemascope or any widescreen process. So, I don't want to hear anyone complaining about this being a ""Full Screen Version"". That is the only way it can be viewed. Also, even though Miklos Rozza's score is not as dramatic as Ben Hur, or any others he composed during this time period, there is obvious similarities to Ben Hur. Close to the end of the film, the march he used at the end of the Chariot Race of Ben Hur is exactly duplicated note for note. Also, throughout the film, those with a good ear will notice other similarities to Ben Hur."
5,Wow!,This is an enormously entertaining and satisfying epic! Absolutely worth seeing. The three-hour running time just flies by. Ustinov is a wonderfully evil character we love to hate. . . one for the ages. Enjoy!
4,Not Your Usual Religious Status Quo,"Quo Vadis is an entertaining film that although is a bit slow from the start draws all its force to a powerful conclusion. I think Robert Taylor was miscast for this film as he doesn't give off much of a presence, still the mind blowing sets and Ustinov make up for that and overall this film is a grand scale of old Hollywood film making that is long gone."
3,Relatively Weak Epic,"When a 600 page book is condensed to a movie, it's exprected that some of the nuances of the book would be lost. Unfortunately, it was changed to such a degree from the book that it almost changed the meaning the book tried to convey entirely. Vinicius was a full convert by the end of the book, and at the end of the movie it seemed he still only converted in order to get the girl.As far as the actual production, there were some lavish scenes as are expected from the old epics, but nowhere on the range of what was found in such religious dramas as King of Kings and Ben-Hur where there were larger than life characters that perfectly complemented the larger than life scenes.Quo Vadis is not without its good points, and the final climax is done fantastically, and the madness of Nero really shines through at key moments."
2,Big disappointment,"I have been waiting for ""Quo Vadis "" on DVD for years to complete the "" Ben Hur"" , "" King of Kings "" trilogy. Considereing the stunningpresentation of ""King of Kings "" I was sure ""Quo Vadis was going to be on an equal par especially since it was remastered in an ultraresolution.What a disappointment. Image appeared flat and the technicolor was pale and lackluster. A far cry from the ""King of Kings"" presentation.I hope the blu ray disc due out for Easter is an improvement."
5,Great Movie; most demonstrating of the real Bible & Rome,"This is an awesome movie. Anyone interested in rome, the Bible, or even A love story should watch it. it makes a great gift. Its about Christianity and the persecution they endured. It shows the burning of rome and the christians being put in a stadium and then letting lions in. Nero was a crazy guy."
3,A historic performance,"A number of films have been made of this book. This performance was the latest at the time and the most lavish. The book was very much more bloodthirsty than the film, which had the most horrific episodes watered doen for obvious reasons. The acting by Peter Ustinov was fantastic. An entertaining film."
4,QV is pre-Widescreen,"Though I agree this is a great movie due for DVD release, it can't be anamorphic widescreen as it came out in 1951, two years before ""Widescreen"" movies debuted (excepting early experiments like 1927's Napoleon or 1930's Big Trail with John Wayne)."
5,"Booklist, May 15, 2000 Media Review","Adult actor Mariette Hartley, who has been diagnosed with ADD/ ADHD (attention deficit disorder/attention deficit hyperactivity disorder), hosts this exceptionally well produced survey of ADD/ ADHD in adults. Such treatment options as prescription medicines, professional therapy, and lifestyle changes offer hope for those afflicted with this genetic neurobiologic disorder. Interviews with ADD/ADHD sufferers, family members, and medical experts detail symptoms, resultant behaviors, and effects. Hartley periodically summarizes key points and helps ease subject transitions. With superb editing, pacing, and topic coverage, this informative program is highly recommended."
5,Awesome Swim Teacher,"I have bought this product for each of my three children and now the oldest two swim very well without it. I am looking to buy the one that supports the six to nine year old group for my youngest who still needs help on occasion. The chlorine really takes a toll on the fabric, so we need a new one! But it is so worth it as it really has saved a lot of money in swim lessons. A child must move their arms and legs to remain upright and therefore the natural actions of swimming become second nature while helping their bouyancy at the level that they need it...fabulous product."
1,Book does not discuss some elementary Fortran statements,"I feel the title of the book is extremely misleading. With no mention of ""common"", no discussion of ""subroutine"", or ""equivalence"" this book is not suitable for a Fortran programmer who wishes to learn C++ by converting statements from F. to C. Nor are the C++ concepts placed in the context of Fortran. Author could write a book on every language for C++ programmers with minimal effort - just include a few short simple programs in the other language. Don't buy if you expect to benefit from your Fortran experiance."
2,"Great book, but poor edition","I would actually warn against this edition of 'You Can't Win.' While nothing against the content of the narrative itself, this edition fails to present itself as a book of relevance; it has a terribly designed jacket with no synopsis of the memoir, there is no foreword or introduction (both of which appear in the original edition), no information about the author, and it is also lacking the rather amusing 'acknowledgement' page included in the original edition. The design is so sparse there is nothing to recommend actually picking up this book and reading it. In fact, the way the book is presented, you actually don't want to waste your time. I bought this as a gift for my friend, and was disappointed to find how little the book itself recommended itself to a potential reader. You know you shouldn't judge a book by its cover, but don't you anyway? Try finding an old hardcover edition instead..."
4,All in all a very good book and CD,This book is pretty much exactly what a for dummies book should be. It's an enjoyable light read about the blues. The coverage is extensive and written in an entertaining fashion. The knowledge of the authors is indisputable. I only have a couple of complaints:This book was written in 1998 and not updated since so the contemporary blues section is missing some obvious important new comers (Eric Bibb for example) and online resources are hopelessly out of date ([...]).I expected the Playing the Blues section to have a little bit of theory and perhaps some tips for each instrument but its about putting together a band that could play the blues. Given the authors experience I don't doubt the value of this information but I just wasn't expecting that information and question what percentage of readers need that versus some getting started tips on playing.
1,"Buy the music, read better books, live the blues...","I really resent the titles of the ""XXXX for Dummies,"" since as a teacher I think it creates self-images of inadequacy... The book is OK. Man, the blues is music. Get out there, get the CDs, Hound Dog Taylor, Rev. Gary Davis, Miss. John Hurt, Muddy, etc. Listen and enjoy and support your local blues organizations and clubs. Books for dummies. Nah."
2,Don't waste your money,Here's another classic example of a reason so many people dislike science. How can we expect people to put up with the bad language and lack of motivation and application? Textbooks ought to set an example of good writing. The authors do not pay attention to the reader. They just bundle a few points together and call it a book. There's no desire to rise above the median.
2,Mccourts of New York,"Very disappointing.Disjointed effort on behalf of a McCourt nephew. Seems more like a school project rather than the touching journal that resulted in Angela's Ashes. Some frames are out of focus(not an effect). Too much focus on Malachy, not even-handed. Turned a well-intentioned story into a drudgery. Not even enough photos that would have made the difference."
3,Disappointing,"While Mr. Buchan provides interesting bits of knowledge, the book as a whole lacks a sense of cohesion to this reader. It seems torn between an attempt at a history of Edinburgh during a specific time and a random discussion of famous Scots of the same era.While Mr. Buchan is a good writer, this is not a great book."
5,Love this coffee,I found this to be a very close version of the Douwe Egberts Columbian coffee that I've had at a nice country club. If only it came in regular grounds so I could more easily share it with others in my office......
2,"Bad voice, not much like sublime",Every review compares this group to sublime its been 3 years this album has come out and isnt big at all. The singer has really no talent. The other musicians are not bad but the voice just does not fit this type of music.
5,Wallace Flatware Service for 12,This is a very nice set of stainless; heavy and well balanced. The organizer makes a huge difference and fits in drawers very nicely. It's a lovely set of stainless and would go well with a more formal meal. Check in any of the retail stores and see what you would pay for 18/8 stainless.....well worth the price.
5,remember,"Remember what it was like at a time when one race was above another, tension among families and friends increased, war generals shaped history with foolishness and pure genius... while the act of serving one's country was the honorable, and expected, thing to do.Not too different from today I supose.This movie captures and portrays the Civil War in such an intimate and honorable way. Excellent performances. Moving soundtrack.It is one of my favorite movies (well, it just might be my favorite). I highly recomend it to those who are history geeks, want to ""go back in time and experience historic events in our nation"", or simply be entertained by a story of true heroism and sacrifice."
4,Subject for my research paper.,This is a great film. I selected it for my research project that I'm working on for my English comp class.two thumbs up.
5,Best war history film ever!,"The first time I watched this film, I was taken aback by how real the images appeared. It reminded me of one of my high school history teachers who constantly reminded us younger students that ""when these men fought, they didn't get back up and star in another movie."" This couldn't be more true in the case of this film. The richness and clarity of reality portrayed in this film has never been seen since and probably won't for some time to come."
3,Hit And Miss,"I liked the script, cinematography, supporting actors, costumes, and locations. I disliked the music's exaggerated swells of string, choral, and flute crescendos dictating my emotions during key scenes. It's also absurd that the 3 highest ranking officers would be ahead of the bloodiest charge instead of behind the front line. Finally, Broderick is the soft computer geek of ""Wargames"" and the soft slacker semi-geek ""Ferris Buller"" and I simply could not suspend my disbelief."
5,The Greatest Movie of All Time!!!,"Glory has to be the greatest movie of all time. I was first able to watch this film last year in my history class. Even with terrible picture and sound, I still thought that the movie was awesome. Combine the actual movie with the quality of DVD and you have the greatest movie of all time. All of the elements from the actors, to the director and producer, to the music all came together to make an unforgettable movie!"
4,Great Movie,This movie has so many stars in it. It is great to watch it on a weekend just kicking back. it is recommended.
5,One of the greatest movies ever!,"If you haven't seen it, like war movies, and like great acting, this movie is for you! Denzel Washington, Morgan Freeman, and Matthew Broderick? Enough said!"
5,Seriously Awesome War Flick,I definitely have to give this movie 5 stars. It was the best Civil War movie I have ever seen. And I've seen them all!I recommend watching Glory if you haven't yet seen it.
1,Blu-ray sound and video are highly disappointing,"We were expecting a great blu-ray master from this wonderful movie, but were sorely disappointed. The blu-ray transfer is dismal both in sound and video. The picture is very grainy and murky with the colors quite off. It looks as if the studio had taken the cheapest way out of the process that it could have. The sound is also very lackluster and disappointing and does not have the clarity and punch we expect from the latest format. The studio cheaped out and ruined a great movie for this format. Shame on them!"
5,"A moving film, a great Civil War Film","What a great story. This film is a wonderful film for both C.W. buffs and those who do not necessarily like war films, as well as young adults learning about those characteristics in people they should choose to emulate.The story of men who have had little contact with other social classes, who are now being confronted with this different culture, has been done countless times in the past, yet this film portrays these men with grace. This film is completely believable (where other films often are not) and adequately develops these characters.This was probably the first time in human history that white men and black men ever came together in this situation, and it tells the story gloriously (no pun intended)."
5,Glory and Praise,"By far one of the best films ever! Glory is the perfect combination of cinematography, score, directing, acting , and writing. Matthew Broderick and Denzel Washington star along with other memorable actors (Cary Elwes, Morgan Freeman, et al) and convey the story of Robert Shaw and his regiment of African-American soldiers. Although it's not a long film, the writing is concise and the audience gets to know every character so that when the end comes there won't be a dry eye in the house."
5,Dynamic Duo,"The unflappable blue blood Gary Cooper and the eccentric and conniving Burt Lancaster make for one of the cinema's strangest pairings in this over-the-top Western. Filmed in Mexico, this film has enough gunfights, chases, double crosses, battles, women, wine and song to keep you well absorbed and entertained. However, Robert Aldrich's aloof directorial style was somewhat disconcerting to the Mexican government according to the documentary on THE MAGNIFICENT SEVEN DVD. You decide."
1,Great idea ruined by VERY poor sound...,"You'd think companies would leave well enough alone... but NO, they have to go and try to improve things that DON'T need improving or CAN'T improved.Frankly, the collection of cartoons on this DVD is excellent, but I can't recommend the disk. While the visual quality ranges from fair to very good, the audio is atrocious. Instead of simply cleaning up the old mono tracks for the toons, the company that released this DVD went ahead and ""remastered"" the soundtracks to the cartoons ==> ERGO, witness sound effects that NEVER existed in the original toons and horribly imbalanced soundtracks!Save your money...Hopefully, someone WILL release better versions of these toons in the near future."
4,An Introductory basis for Calculus,"This book will build a good base for calculus. The only problem with the book is that there are not enough examples nor enough variability in the exercises. Sometimes you would have to use another precalculus book as reference. In overall it has great subjects in logistic and mathematical theorems with their proofs,and you would learn how to build those proofs."
3,a hearth not so black,"This film is reasonably good. The problem are two: Firstly, Clint Eastwood doesn't make here one of his best works as director, but that has for me one main reason; the screenplay or the plot: the making of ""The African Queen"" with Katherine Hepburn and Humphrey BogartAll that deals with the personality of John Huston, another director even more famous than Eastwood. But for me, Huston, no doubt also a good director, wasn't in reality the nonchalant adventurer Hollywood wanted to create about him. Films of Huston contains almost ever, medical or clinical details when nor enter fully in these themes as in the case of ""Freud"". A real adventurer isn't by nothing a reasonable person, not so cautious as Huston seemed to be at bottom."
3,"Good writer, needs to ditch romance subplot ...","Hmm - it's hard to know how to rate this book. The best I can say that it is very uneven - I LOVED the parts about the restaurant and the relationship between Rose and Anna, but I'm afraid that Anna's romance with Mason left me cold. It feels like something simply tacked on to give the book a romantic interest and I can't help feeling that the author didn't have her heart in writing these scenes. I skimmed over those bits in the end (especially when Mason was going on about wild birds of something) and I wish she had just concentrated on the restaurant and the relationships between the people who worked there - that was fascinating and I was constantly being amazed by the honesty and astuteness of her writing. I don't know if the publishers made her put in a love interest so the book would sell but I feel it would have actually been a great book if it had only focused on Anna's relationship with her aunt and her employees at the restaurant."
4,Obsessive Compolsive Gilmore Girls fan!,"Yes, like most people who have ever seen Gilmore Girls I am addicted. I watch it day and night and whenever I am not watching it I am either thinking about it or listening to this CD. It is amazing. First of all the songs basically remind you of the show and plus they catch everything. Even the ""Lalalals."" If you consider yourselfe a fan then you must consider buying this CD. I promise after you buy, your world will only consist of Gilmore Girls. Oh yeah random question: Who is your favorite Gilmore Girls character? What's your favorite season? I love everyone, but the character that really sticks out is Jess, Lukes nephew. During season three I was so addicted to him Gilmore Girls basically controlled every aspect of my life! Jess was mostly in season three. So rent season three if you don't remeber it. It's awesome just like this CD!"
4,Our Little Corner of the World: Music From Gilmore Girls,This is a terriffic c.d.. My only complaint is song number 3. It's disturbing. Even my 15 year old won't listen to it! But the rest of the c.d. is as refreshing and smile provoking as the television show!
1,Even the Grandparents have better taste.,The Gilmore Girls series involves a lot of music. How about those trubadores? There's music everywhere.I bought this CD for my wife and even she didn't recognize the music. I was very disapointed. Here is a show with so much good music and this is the best they can do? Very sad.Go with the DVD collection of the series but don't buy this CD. This little corner of the world doesn't reflect the quality of music displayed by the Gilmore Girls.
2,* * out of * * * * * stars,"I love Gilmore Girls. It's my favorite show. When I bought this CD however, I was quite displeased. I don't think there's much variety in the music and I don't really care for most of the songs they chose. Listening to the songs reminded me of the scenes they were played in, so that was a plus. But I think I can tolerate the music more if it's being played in the scenes, not as a whole song. It probably depends on your taste in music, but personally I wouldn't encourage anyone to buy it."
3,Ehhhh,"The soundtrack has a lot of songs that remind of Gilmore Girls, but I found it disappointing in other ways. For example, I'd like to be able to purchase an album with ALL of the Sam Phillips musical cues. There are some amazing ones and the music truly seperates Gilmore Girls from other shows. This disc only has 3 or 4 of the cues, and they aren't even my favorites.Most of the songs are familiar from the show and an avid Gilmore fan like me can place exactly where they occur and which episode. They are missing, however, a song from the episode where Rory goes to the party after having broken up with Dean and Lorelai goes back to Max. It's a really pretty song and I was disappointed when it wasn't on the cd.I'd say if you're a fan of the show, go ahead and buy it, but it's not a ""must have"" in my opinion and the makers of the cd should make a new one with more of the musical cues."
4,Gilmore Girls Rock,"I loved the CD. The main reason I bought the CD is that my 8 month old daughter loves the music during the episodes. I own the 1st 4 seasons on DVD and we are just about out of shows to watch. She loves the opening song and the closing credits. The only thing I was upset over was that the closing credits were not on the CD. Otherwise, it is a CD that will rock in our household for years to come."
1,Ridiculous Justice,"How does and Aikaido master let himself get fat and bloated? I guess alcohol and Twinkies. So you have to ask yourself: How does he keep making movies? Well, it helps that he is Jewish.If you compare Urban Justice to his last few films, it is slightly better. And I always appreciate a good neck or arm snap as much as the next guy. But compared to a modern action film like Bourn Ulimatum and the like, this is pure trash."
1,Don't waste your time,This is an expensive ice bucket. It actually takes up to 20 minutes to chill a bottle of wine with this device ! Do not waste your time or money on this product. It is the most foolish purchase I have ever made :-(
1,VinChilla wine chiller,... I returned it without even using it because it did not feel like a quaility item. I would not recomend this product if you have any taste.
3,This is not C and C close up,"Okay yes this was a good game and all,but truthfully i was so disapointed to see that the characters looked nothing like what they were in the original c and c. In the original c and c the gdi infantry didnt look like a plumber. All the troops had on a modern solider oufit. The weapons may I say first are cool, but there not the m-16 or shoulder fired rocket launcher like in the original. The tanks and stuff there good with the exception of the artillery and humm-vee. The look nothing like in the original game. A second thing back to the weapons was that with the exception of the obolisk of light and ion cannon there were no laser weaponry. Also if nod had lots of lasers in 1999(yea 1999)then why didnt they have them in Command and Conquer Tiberium Sun for every solider. A DUH!!!"
4,Very good game if you are into C&C,Its awesome to finally be able to drive the tanks and shoot the weapons in first person mode. I just hope they expand it.
2,don't like the demo,"first of all, i'm a huge fan of the command & conquer games. i have every one of them (except this one).. red alert 2: yuri's revenge is one of my favorite games ever. anyhow, i downloaded the demo of renegade and i was so disappointed. it just does not compete with the good fps games.. get medal of honor: allied assault instead. actually, there are 1 level demos of renegade and mohaa..get them both and see the difference!!!!"
1,Terrible movie!,"This is a terrible movie! I was SO disappointed. Like a lot of Chinese movies, there's a lot that is not translated. It was unnecessarily bloody in the beginning, with extremely stereotyped characters. You know, lonely monarch with a pathetic need for someone to love him for himself, beautiful spoiled princess, and The Artist who lives only for his Art, and is totally clueless about the world around him.... you get the picture. The only good thing is that's it's in Mandarin, which is nice for practicing one's Chinese."
2,A crowning disappointment,"Don't judge Bernard Cornwell by this book. It's simply not up to his usual standard of work. As I understand it, he co-wrote the book with his wife some time ago. I bought it hoping it would be a typical Bernard Cornwell novel and it simply wasn't."
5,I didn't realize how much I missed this album.,I had this on vinyl when it first came out. It's still as good as ever. Brilliant musically and lyrically
3,Hit and miss collection,"For those who want a few songs without haveing to buy full albums. Heart was best in the 70s, in my opinion, so those are the tunes that resonate for me. If you want to study the evolution of the band, get the full albums and break out the giant head phones."
3,Essentially Heart,"The compilation album ""Essential Heart"" is a great cd for fans of the group Heart, featuring Ann and Nancy Wilson. It covers a wide variety of Heart songs from albums released during their first 20 years together. The cd includes the big hits from Heart's first successes during the years of 1975 to 1982 and also from their amazing comeback years of 1983 to 1990. While the cd contains all of the major chart hits, it also includes the not so well known songs that the true fans love. With 37 Heart songs included on the album, it is a great source of the group's musical work."
4,presents good surroundings about real-embedded system,This book has wide contents about embedded system but brief. Readers will take many basic concepts of real system and embedded design. This book is appropriate to the beginner of embedded design.
3,Internet Buddy Web Journal,"Although thoughtout well, I personally would have liked a tab that located the indexes.I would not recommend ,due to it's large size if you travel any."
4,Like it!,"This is a handy little journal for keeping a list of my favorite web-sites and noting my passwords, etc. Much better than keeping the info in a spreadsheet where it could disappear forever! Tip: Write your info in a No. 2 pencil so you can change info as needed."
3,"Ok, but room for improvement","As it stands, this organizer does the job which is the main point of it. I like the quality and the size. However, there is room for improvement.My first gripe is that there are not enough pages for some of the more used letters while the letters I,Q,X,Y and Z have more pages than they need. Recognizing that some letters are used more frequently and rectifying that would have made this more useful. I was out of room in ""C"" the first day.My second gripe is that there are no letter tabs on the pages. You must search through the book each time which turns out to be very annoying. I solved this by buying my own tabs and adding them. That improved the functionality but doesn't look as good as if it had been made that way. I also resent having to do it myself.This is a 3* book that could easily have been a 5* with a little extra effort. Unfortunate. I would try a different book next time."
5,"Convenient, easy to use, discreet","This notebook is very easy to use and looks very discreet if you have it standing upright in a bookcase or faced down. It has enough space to write any website, screen name, etc. It doesn't have individual tabs for each letter, but that doesn't bother me since it's no biggie to me to simply thumb through the pages for 2 seconds until I find the letter I need."
5,Plangent prose,"This is a wondrous book on travel through Mittel Europa just before a world that had lasted for centuries was brutally erased only a few years later by Nazism, communism and finally modernism. A world of unique tribes and customs, and great natural beauty forever vanished"
4,Great Game If you have the Power,"Thank god I'm running a Geforce3 Ti Graphics card with a P4 1.6 GHZ processor and almost 700MB of RAM. This game will EAT your computer up if you arent well aboove the requirements in my opinion. If you CAN handle this...I highly reccomend it.Comanche 4 takes a step away from the complicated, often too annoying to learn flight sims that have come out as of late.You take off with one button, and fly with your mouse. It couldn't be easier. Choosing your weapon is a mouse click away, and firing it is just the same.The game play is pure arcade fun. It's not as involved as Ghost Recon, or the Rainbow Series (if you consider the Rainbow series to have a good storyline haha right) but its just as much fun.When you buy this...know your getting an ARCADE style helicopter shooter...not a flight sim. One of the simplest yet most fun games out there."
4,Stuff blows up great!,"When this game initially arrived, I played it enough to sprain my wrist. Things blow up spectacularly; this game really pushes current hardware. I use a Athlon XP 1700+ and ATI Radeon All-in-Wonder, and I'm upgrading the video card because higher resolutions are too slow. Note that the game warns about reduced framerates under Windows 2000 (I'm upgrading to XP, too).The missions all seem pretty short (I've played about ten of the thirty). They seem quite variable in difficulty. Sometimes caution is called for, and sometimes a mad, all-out rush is necessary. It's hard to tell when each is appropriate.The sound and video of this game are phenomenal. If you're looking for something to take advantage of your high-end system, I highly recommend it."
3,Title is Misleading,"This book is designed for parents of children who are allergic to the most common allergenic foods. The ""everything"" means the usual foods, but if your child has multiple food allergies, this really isn't the book for you."
3,Great tasting recipes that avoid only some common allergens,"This book is a good one to add to your library of allergy cookbooks. There are a variety of great-tasting recipes, so you're likely to find one that makes a dessert your child is craving. If your child truly has multiple allergies, however, this book may not have any recipes you can use. I was also disappointed that most of the recipes use sugar and a gluten flour. For a no wheat, milk, eggs, corn, soy, yeast, sugar, grain and gluten comprehensive recipe book (all meals, snacks, desserts), I highly recommend ""Allergy Cooking With Ease"" by Nicolette Dumke. Feeding a child with allergies is a challenge. Finding even one recipe they love makes it easier. Best wishes to you and your child."
3,"Good (not great) movie, average picture, poor sound...","While I enjoyed Manhattan on Blu-ray as far as the film itself goes, the picture quality is average at best and the sound is just poor. Throughout the movie there are more than a few times that the dialog is unintelligible due to low volume. I never have this problem with other movies including other Allen films so it's Manhattan on blu-ray in particular that seems to be mixed way too low in some scenes. Overall the sound is uninspiring and flat which actually does hurt the enjoyment of the story so you've got to really pay attention. I don't think this is one of Allen's best films, however, I still enjoy his take on relationships, people and how those people interact with one another in the context of supremely complex feelings and emotions regarding thier relationships."
3,Mediocre for Woody Allen,"""Manhattan"" is good, and a must-have for Woody Allen film collectors, of course. It's not one of Allen's best, but enjoyable. I especially liked the many shots of New York City, many at the start of the film. Gershwin's music was highlighted; very nice. I rate the photography and muscial score a definite five star. The storyline, however, was tedious--and immature, I thought, for Allen. He obviously froths over young girls embarking on womanhood, not only in his film but in his personal life as well; I don't think this quirk needed to be brought to the screen. Acting performances were so-so, and intellectual ""streams of consciousness,"" typical in most Allen films, lacking for the most part. Well, to each his own."
1,Don't buy this old disc. New 2-disc coming out soon....,"This DVD was released when DVDs first started coming out. There are no extras and it is full screen,etc. a SPECIAL EDITION version is due to be released August 24, 2004(along with ""Goodfellas""....FINALLY!). It will have 3 documentaries and 7 music videos(4 from Prince). And it will be 1.85 widescreen. Don't buy this old piece of crud...wait for the newer version. The movie is great, but this DVD is worthless no matter what the price of it is."
3,5 stars for the film 1 star for the DVD,"Purple Rain is a classic film. It was an unexpected huge success. As a long time Prince fan I was happy when Purple Rain came out on DVD. While I'm happy to have Purple Rain on DVD, I was sorely disappointed with the lack of featurettes. I suppose this might have something to do with Prince's escape from Warner Brothers..."
3,Uninspiring,"I found some of the ""habits"" to be either obvious or outdated. A good read, but not the best."
2,eh.,"This book concludes with thinly veiled Mormon theology that makes it inappropriate for use in Christian study groups. However, viewed as a secular work, this may be useful for some people. Avoid the many knick-knacks, doodads, and complementary products that are also sold under the Covey name."
