1,Not good quality,"I bought this thinking it would look very nice like the one in the picture but it looks bad, the details are horrible, it's missing the 2 stars on the sides, the words are small compared tom the picture, the eagle looks like it has a bullet through its eye. The colors are not the Air Force colors, the patch is more of a baby blue and the yellow is more of a highlighter yellow. Overall not satisfied at all."
2,Not worth the money,I paid $20 for this game and beat it from start to finish in less than 30 minutes. If you like the movie I think you might enjoy this game but it was just way to short and way too easy and any price over $10 is too much.
2,"Weak Examples, Not Much Meat","This book may have some content that is hard to find anywhere else but overall it was a big disappointment for me. I was looking for some real insight in how to write effective macros for manipulating text and this book only had 1 chapter on ""the code model."" The chapter was devoid of any decent example of using the TextSelection object.I also didn't like the fact that the 3 author approach was so obvious. Some examples were in VB and some in C#. You would think they'd write the whole book in 1 language. I don't care which one but pick one. Since macros have to be written in VB.Net you'd think the whole book would have been in VB.Net.This one missed the mark for me."
3,Psych reports for clinicans,This is probably a useful text for doing eval but for writing up case notes and reports this is more based on eval type reports. This was an error on my part understanding what this text was.
4,A must-have for Wilfrido Vargas y los Beduinos fans. Superb!,"This album is a great anthology of Wilgrido Vargas' Golden Years (Años Dorados) during the '80s. If you're familiar with Wilfrido, you'll recognize all the songs in this album. Check out the saxophones in ""El Barabarazo."" The only drawback? This CD features new releases, not the original tracks with vocalists such as Rudy Pérez and ""Tu Amigo"" Miguelito."
2,Horrible Sound Quality,"This was my first experience with the Peter Green-led Fleetwood Mac. The sound quality on this disc is so awful, I felt cheated. Fortunately I didn't give up and found ""Then Play On"". Gets one star for actually playing in the CD player, the other because Peter Green is the baddest white boy on the gitfiddle this side of Stevie Ray Vaughan. (though it doesn't show on this disk, at least that which I could hear). For completists only.If you are looking for a great Live Mac album, check for the Recall - import double CD issue of the Fleetwood Mac ""Boston Blues."" These are the sets from which the ""Live at the Boston Tea Party"" re-issues were issued, and you won't be dissappointed. Plus you get two of those three discs for the price of one-and-a-half."
4,"Lovely, heart-rending story...","I assume that most of the readers of this book will, like me, be people who have a friend or loved one suffering from Alzheimers. I bought ""Alzheimers, A Love Story"" looking for some concrete answers and suggestions, but instead found a lovely, highly personal story of one woman's struggle with her husband's early years with the disease. Although I was at first disappointed, since I didn't find much information about the hows and whys, I am now very pleased that I discovered this book."
4,"10k White Gold, Round, Diamond Stud Earrings (3/4 cttw, IJK Color, I2-I3 Clarity)",I received exactly what was described! Thank you!
2,not impressive...,size was ok (but on the smaller size which is expected). However the clarity and color were terrible. I returned the earrings and will be spending more from now on.
2,Received a dirty product...,"Would have been a great purchase had the tie been 'clean'. Received a dirty piece as if it was hanging in a dusty closet for years. Can see sparkling white areas at the reverse side, which it would have looked like if it was clean. Good product if 'white' is removed from the description."
1,FAR TO FAT,Gets dirty easily and it is REALLLY wide abnormally wide to the point that it is ugly I see no way to wear it when it is so wide or goes from one side of my waist to the other maybe I am just skranny but I doubt if
2,Not for advanced riders,This video is pretty basic. It did not offer much in the way of speeding up your run or fixing problems. Ok for beginners.
3,Helpful primer...,"Gave me a lot of useful information on how US railroads operate as I venture into new territory with my modelling. Just a shame it's not available via the UK Amazon site. Now all I need is a similar ""newbies start here"" on US freight rolling stock. There are some very helpful books on the UK scene so surely there must be similar ones for American modellers?"
4,The Scared Shore,I have enjoyed this series of books written by Jennifer Fulton. She can make a nice gay loive story a page turner'
2,Dont buy it if you have a curved back,I would give it a 1... but thr price I paid was awesome. So I got the matress like 10 months ago. I thought it was the best thing at first.Problems:1. It comes in 3 sections and it has a THIN cover to keep them in place2. WHAT EVERYONE SAYS: SINKING HOLES. For 2 people it happens in the middle and the sides b/c of how tight the cover is that Eventually it turns into this dark yellowish color.3. It seems like both the top and bottom sections have shrunk and now the middle one sticks out farther. Looks sloppy.4. My back hurts pretty bad and I have to keep a pillow under my lower back to keep it from getting sorei bought it when it was 299 Now. I sure as hell wouldnt buy it even for that price
1,A TOAST TO YOU! REVISED REVIEW,"Very nice glasses. They would make a thoughtful gift, along with a nice bottle of champagne. They are worth the price. Came very well wrapped..Sorry, have to change this review to a 1 star. We used them on our anniversary, hand-washed them, put them away in our china cabinet, no problem. I took them out and chilled them for a 40th New Year's toast. Hand-washed them, and the ruby writing on the glasses washed off. What a bummer! Now all I have are 2 PLAIN champagne flutes. Total rip-off, not worth the price because of bad ""paint job"". So much for that ""keepsake"" to pass on to the children."
3,Watch the description,"The vacuum feature of the trimer is fantastic compared to the older models which shot trimmings out all over the sink area.The only draw backs are no travel pouch is included and no specialty mini trimmer included with the T780.Great trimmer for trimming large areas or large amounts of hair i.e, winter to summer beard.Too large to get in to smaller areas or to use to do detailed trimmingRecommend the T980 which comes with the Mini trimmer and travel pouch if you can afford it."
5,cleaner shaven,"Product two steps up from great grand child I used for 11 years! Darn near the same price. Was delivered before time promised and it really does pick up most of the uck that wife complained about with old model. charge lasts much longer, and has much better cutting ability with less pull..."
5,Great Beard Trimmer,This trimmer does what it is susposed to do - trim your beard. It fits into your hand well and is very easy to use and clean. The vacuum works well and very little hair escapes it. The length adjustment also is easy to use. You can't go wrong with this trimmer.
1,Very disappointed,"It doesnt' work as well as it says. I have to empty it every couple of minutes cause hair gets stuck and doesn't work. The vacuum doesn't suck at all, all the hair gets stuck at the blade. I would not recommend it."
2,"OK for a while, then died.","I really didn't get more than a year out of this. It worked nicely while it did, but about 8 months into owning it, the battery would deplete within a day of full recharge. At the end of the year, unusable."
1,Damaged goods,"The item arrived damaged from the shipper, it was unuseable. The shipper made good by refunding my purchase price. I would have reted the product higher I suppose if it had been useable. This was not the fault of the shipper, only the shipping company who transported it to my door, in a crushed box. I think it was DHL."
3,You need to be really interested,"The book is basically 3 pages from the author, a 13 page excerpt from a paper by Roosevelt Fitzgerald at the University of Nevada, and the remainder is bad copies of newpaper clippings. The pictures are particularly hard to make out. If you have a intense interest in finding about th MR, this may be the best source, but don't expect a traditional history. For example, the author managed the place for period of time, but there about about 4 sentences relating to that experience."
2,The only reference out there.,"If you want to know what the Moulin Rouge Hotel and Casino was, this book will tell you. If you want greater detail, you have to do your own search. There is not a lot of information regarding the Moulin Rouge, in general, but if you are a casino fan and love Las Vegas, this book is a must."
3,THE BOOK CLEARLY OUTLINES UFO PROPULSION.,"MOST UFO BOOKS PUT UFO SPACE SHIPS AND THEIR PROPULSION DRIVES IN THE REALM OF SOMETHING SUPERNATURAL. D.V. WILLIAMS EXPLAINS THAT POINT OF VIEW IS A METHOD TO CONVINCE PEOPLE NOT TO INVEST IN UFO PROPULSION DESIGN.THE AUTHOR STATES THAT WORLD GOVERNMENTS DENY THE EXISTENCE OF UFO'S BUT AT THE SAME TIME CONDUCTS FORMAL UFO RESEARCH. THE AUTHORS CLAIM A COMPLETE UFO SHIP AND PROPULSION DESIGN WAS SEEN BY EZEKIEL, A PROPHET IN A THE BIBLE. THE AUTHOR ATTEMPTS TO MODEL A PROTOTYPE FROM EZEKIEL'S DESCRIPTION AND THEN HAVE THE PROTOTYPE PATENTED. FOR A FIRST EDITION BOOK, IT WAS NOT TOO BADLY WRITTEN AND THE INFORMATION CONTAINED THEREIN MAY CHANGE HOW MAN VIEWS THE PARADOX OF UFO PHENOMENA."
5,Delicious pretzels,My son has been enjoying these pretzels since his pre-wheat days. They are delicious! More flavorful than typical wheat pretzels and in a convenient size to bring along. My only wish was that they also made a family size bag.
3,Great product bad service,When we received the order the AC works great cools a 30x20' room. Only problem was that it took 3 1/2 weeks to arrive. By amazons estimate it should have been 5 days for delivery. Do not trust estimated delivery times.
4,Helping my dog to feel less anxiety about being groomed,"Our Pets ecoPure Lavender Aromatherapy SprayI use many natural products for my own wellbeing, and prefer to do the same for my dog, a not-so-mini Schnauzer. Her temperament makes her a bit anxious when going to the groomer's, so I selected Our Pets ecoPure Lavender Aromatheraphy Spray for her. I spray it in the area where she is lying on her dog bed about 30 minutes before her grooming appointment. (It only takes ten minutes to drive there.)The scent of lavender with essential oils seems to reduce my dog's anxiety. During her most recent trip to the groomer's (last week), she was almost laidback in her behavior, from when we arrived and went into the grooming salon until her grooming was completed and we left. I got a good ""report"" from the groomer about my dog's behavior, so I will continue to use this product."
3,"stone too dark, looks cheap","Got this ring as a gift, the stone looks much darker than the picture(almost black) and the setting looks a bit costume jewelryish."
4,First Ring,I originally bought this ring for my niece when she turned 12 and she wore it everyday. It held up beautifully during all the normal rough and tumble play for the last 4 years. I'm buying her a new one only because she lost it while swimming and is heartbroken. I highly recommend this as a first ring.
1,Deciving,The image of the ring on line is much prettier than what you actually receive! The quality in person looks cheap.
4,beautiful product,"beautiful ring. It was just the right size and color. I recieved my shipment in a speedy fashion, I would recommend this item and provider to friends."
4,Pretty nice item,"The sapphire is a lot paler than what the picture shows. In fact it looks more like glass than I would have liked. But the price and fit was right, and I wasn't expecting it to look like a $1,000 ring, so overall I was satisfied."
5,Modern Legend,"I bought this CD for the well-known track, ""She's Royal"". I was beyond stunned to find that that particular song - in my opinion - is one of the lesser songs on this album. This album is beautiful & I can play it teh whole way through without skipping. There are several serious gems on this album such as Lion Paw, Africa Awaits & My Baby that I think will become legends in their own right. Get this CD, it is one of the only roots reggae albums besides Bob Marley's that I believe deserve to be labeled a classic."
3,So-so,"This was a television special meant for the BBC that was cancelled by the Stones after they saw the failure of ""Magical Mystery Tour"" and how poorly they measured up next to the great performance of the Who. My first impression was, ""everyone looks so dirty and disheveled."" I wouldn't want anyone looking like this to move into my neighborhood! Sure, the Stones were at their creative peak, but they look like hell here. Didn't anyone take a bath, wash their faces, clean their clothes? The Who look awful. Lennon and Ono (trying to steal the limelight, as usual, with her talentless screeching) look like they just fell out of bed. Yuk! Buy this if you want to see some vintage songs performed by these groups when they were young. Make sure you have the fast forward remote rady, though."
5,Performances In Full Swing,"On this DVD is what must be one of the best Jumping Jack Flash renditions.Among great footage is Marianne Faith (so beautiful) singing Something Better. Keith Moon, hmm, You Can't Always Get What You Want. Very interesting to watch John Lennon.All in all a great purchase.Recommended."
4,"acts good, circus concept poor.","the who, taj, dirty mac (john, yoko, clapton, keith) and the stones are all very good. the circus concept is slightly embarrassing, claustrophobic and doesn't work. that's why this show has never been released before now. not essential but interesting to 1960s veterans."
4,Excellent DC/AC INBERTER,"Let me start off by saying I've had this inverter for two months now and it has performed beautifully. The previous inverter I had use to get extremely hot when I used it for long periods of time. It finally melted one day in the car outlet. This inverter is being used primarily with a gaming laptop, for long periods of time five hours or more. It does not get hot at all and gives me all the power I need. Overall I'm extremely pleased with my purchase and highly recommend it."
3,Works ok,"bought this for tailgating and it worked ok. it allowed me run a crock pot on warm and ran a phone charger just fine. But if you want to run a crock pot on low or high it will not work, it beeps the entire time because that requires too much power."
4,Nice product - useful for the car and airplane.,This is a useful product fro travel in the car and the airplane. Please note that it will not work with two laptops attached to the sockets. i guess they suck too much power.
4,Good Book,"I love to read and since I got my Kindle I have been searching Amazon.com for new authors. This was one of the authors I found. Once I read one book and like it, I buy all the authors books and read them."
4,Good Read,"I just finished reading this adaptation by Kathryn Knight and found it to be wonderful. It had fun cartoons for my children and introduced several stories that opened up conversation on honesty, kindness, and pride. I would highly suggest this read for people with kids 2-8.Rob[...]"
5,rubberman,"this is a versatile album. There's ups and downs. Quite dynamic. I like the softer songs, but to me they're all good. Before I knew it, the Cd was over just when I thought I had just started it. It's that good, ... ."
2,Just a lame GTA clone.,Isn't fun. The characters are corny and stupid. It's dumb. It's not fun. It's just a clone of Grand Theft Auto. It's got slow down issues. It's basically the same open sandbox game as GTA but it doesn't have the comedy or satire of GTA. Dumb. I spent $60.00 for it played it for a couple of hours and never played it again. I sold it a week later. Dumb game.
3,Great price,was a great price so i decided to buy this title in prep. for saints 3. i just wish i would have bought the 1 and 2 double pack but i already had 2. Non the less great title and story
2,GTA is way better than this trash.,"GTA is way better than this. In GTA you can fly planes or helicopters,parachute,drive motorcycles,and drive boats. In this game there are planes and helicopters but you're not allowed on them.There are no boats or motorcycles or bikes. Only cars and a train. Some of the voice acting in the game is really cheesy. I still like that you can create your own character but the idiot never talks through the whole game. The game gets really repetitve when you beat it unlike GTA. If you played San Andreas you'll think this game is boring and dull. This is one of the worst GTA clones ever made. If you want a better GTA clone just get CrackDown."
4,"Great game like GTA, but not entirly","This is a great game. You make cars, gangs, and other stuff like GTA, but you can't get planes, jetpacks, or boats. The game suffers from some minor issues aswell. At least there aren't any load times. Still a great game overall for 360."
3,"A GTA clone, but fun anyway","This isn't the greatest game ever. However, if you feel like playing GTA on your 360, and don't want to play your old GTA games, then Saints Row might be for you.I can't emphasize this enough, it is JUST a GTA clone. If you don't like GTA, you aren't going to like this game. If you are expecting something more than GTA, you aren't going to like this game. But if you play it and expect it to be GTA with slightly better graphics, you'll have a good time."
5,Great Game,"Great game, great price..I'd recommend it ! I'm on here trying to buy some more games but this stupid survey came up and won't let me shop."
4,Solid game,Saint's Row is an awesome game! The city is huge and you can do pretty much whatever you want. There are a lot of different activities that are pretty humurous and fun. The missions themselves are awesome as well. I wouldn't say this game is that difficult but definitely still a lot of fun and somewhat addicting.
1,Bad Sound,Why does this CD have the fidelity of a portable AM radio? Did they lose the master tapes?[DW]
3,Disappointing,"The title and jacket discription of this worthy book is highly misleading. While purporting to explain the ""craft"" of reading (although disclaiming to actually ""teach"" that craft), it is merely a string of essays on items that are of interest to the author: how the New Critics estranged readers of poetry, how detective fiction plays with certain rules, what is the definition of science fantasy. The actually ""craft"" of reading is often thrown into the essays as an afterthought, when the author recalls that this is what his book was supposed to be about. While the essays themselves are not without interest and are clearly written, it is dishonest to advertise one thing and deliver another: a literary bait-and-switch. So let the reader (and buyer) beware."
1,DISAPPOINTED,"I bought this book with high expectances, but I don't see any fundamental difference between this and the Instruction Manual included (free) with the camera. Before the EOS 10D, which I deeply love, I had a Nikon Coolpix 990, and bought Peter iNova's ""Mastering Nikon Compact Digital Cameras"" e-book, for about the same money. This one is a really useful and outstanding book. It includes, besides the much better and detailed explanation of all of the camera's functions and tips, a mini course in Photoshop, a comprehensive course in digital photography, printing, special effects, filter operation etc., and a bundle of useful software (not only a couple of trial software) including a lot of iNova's own designed special filters for Photoshop, nothing of which goes in Mr. Curtin's book. With iNova's book, I received much more for the money that I paid. About Mr. Curtin's book, well, I'm very, very disappointed. I feel I loose my money."
2,Nice to have,"Short review, nice to have but not as essential as; ""Goodbye Jumbo "" and ""Bang "". You figure it out yourself."
5,Nina Bangs Fan!!!,"I loved this book!!! If you love paranormal romance stories, anything by Nina Bangs, you can't go wrong."
3,Does Nina Bang?,"I wouldn't bother reading this book if I was looking for literary talent, but it is very mindless and it made me laugh. The characters are very one-dementional and it was easy for me to predict EVERYTHING that happened in this story. But there is a place for even books like this. Those weekday reads when you want to escape, but may need to put it down if you have more important things to do."
3,Just Ok,"Master of Ecstasy is a paranormal romance that lean towards erotica without actually being erotica. It certainly has its share of sex, but I don't think it has anything more than a lot of other romances I've read. What it also has is its fair share of humor, which cuts the sexiness quite a bit. The world-building is very odd, a mixture of 1700s Scotland and the future. I'm not sure that I'll read any more in the series. It wasn't bad, it just didn't really hold my interest much."
2,This book is terrible.,"I'm using this book for a sociology college class. I do not like this book at all. Most of the time the yes/no arguments fail to take a side. Sometimes the yes/no will be an excellent/strong argument for/against while the otherside doesn't even bring the topic of the argument up. The editing of this book is also horrendous. You would think a book using credible sources could get simple words correct. In one topic I found these two errors in a few minutes: ""Most remarkable of all, it is taking place with relatively TITTLE trouble."" & ""By any measure these Asian-American students AND outstanding."" So they are either quoting idiots or the authors are idiots themselves. Don't buy this book...do the research yourself."
4,Great if you want lots of handsets,"I wanted four handsets, so I could place them strategically around the house. For the price, this one can't be beat.Voice quality is great, the only place in the house where I have some interference is within 3ft of my wireless router. Changing the router channel helped.It has all the usual features, intercom, answering machine, caller ID etc. etc. Nothing special, handset quantity make it stand out"
4,from another paperback writer,"I enjoyed Paperback Writer. Bly messed with my head making it clear that not only did his protagonist not know what was real and what was imagined, but neither did I. My wife and I took turns reading on a trip and often stopped and looked at one another when it took another 180 degree turn, catching us off guard and keeping us off balance. He took a chance with this book and in my opinion it works if the reader is willing to go with it. I also very much identified with the conclusions the writer reached about his writing and found them very applicable to my own writing.Terry W. BurnsMysterious Ways Series from River Oakwww.terryburns.net"
2,I love John Hodgman ... BUT ...,"I love John Hodgman on THE DAILY SHOW when he appears. He has an off-kilter sense of humor that is just my style. I bought this book and thought it would be a fun and light read. I couldn't even finish it. The humor, which is sort of a made-up history and explanation of thing, becomes just plain dumb. I didn't laugh. At all. I'll take my Hodgman on THE DAILY SHOW or on his Mac-Apple commercials. I still love his sense of humor. But not on these pages."
2,"Mildy amusing, but mostly dull...","Bought the book based on JH's very funny peformances on the Daily Show, but found it dull. The introduction and personal background lead to high expectations, which are quickly dashed in a series of tedious charts and unfunny lists. 700 hobo names? Making fun of hockey hair? Please. You may find the occasional nugget, but each is buried in layers of tedium. Pass on this one."
4,Pretty Funny,"I enjoyed this book. John Hodgman's humor appeals to me: quirky, sarcastic, and bizarre. It does not serve well as a focused read, but rather is perfect for sporadic enjoyment, for example in travel or as a toilet companion."
2,What the heck is this book about???,"I bought this book on hype. The author is in a couple of cute TV commercials where he place ""PC"" opposite someone else who plays ""Mac"". The book description read like it would be a laugh riot.It's written like an almanac or something. It's just so off-the-wall that I couldn't figure out where I was supposed to laugh. Maybe I just don't have the same mindset this guy has or haven't ingested enough drugs to appreciate the scatter shot, nothing to do with anything and no continuity humor."
1,Just plain stupid,The only reason I finished this book was to write this short review. I think John Hodgman is quite funny when I see him on the Daily Show but this book is just plain stupid. I tried imagining his dead-pan voice while I was struggling through it trying to find the humor but I failed to find the joke. I'm certainly glad I didn't waste my money on it and I'd like to warn others not to waste theirs.
3,Entertaining in small doses,"Hodgman's talented and funny but a little bit goes a long way. Don't try to sit down and read this cover to cover, it'll get unfunny fast."
1,Unfunny,Book is trite and boring. Just long lists of really unfunny stuff. Not even worth keeping in the bathroom.
1,boring and tries too hard,"This is a random grouping of charts and graphs that attempt to be funny in the way of ""The Onion"" type humor. Unfortunately, the book fails to be even moderately funny."
1,Wow,"I knew of this guy from the mac vs. pc commercials and read some of the articles that he has written in the past - and without a doubt - the guy is brilliant, however this book is nearly unreadable. Sorry John - you seem like a nice guy and I feel kind of bad writing this - but I'm glad I borrowed this book from the library instead of buying it. Good luck in your other ventures."
3,Good workmanship but overly heavy for its size,"Purchased this after returning another product with shoddy construction. This will be used in the bathroom so the Whitney basket is a good size for that purpose, but this waste basket is super heavy for its size. That makes it a little inconvenient for easy emptying."
3,Woven Waste basket by Whitney Design,"Although this is beautifully made and very sturdy, I just can't get rid of the odor that is coming from the material it is made of."
1,"Great band, horrible sound","What else can I say. Mountain is a great band, with or without Felix. The tracklist looks like a lot of fun, but once you listen to it you are left with nothing. This is an audio version of a DVD of the same name. Shame on the powers that be who let this thing get released. I've heard better bootlegs then this.Some of the 'official' bootlegs that are available from this band saound much better then this, I assumed that since it did not say 'bootleg' that it would be a great sounding release, boy was I wrong. The vocals are distant at times, the bass is thin, guitars are weak - nothing you'd expect from a professional release.AVOID at all costs, even for the 'true' Mountain fan, this will do nothing but bring an avalanche of heartbreak."
1,CHEAP PLASTIC QUALITY! DON'T EVEN BOTHER!,"This poker set is the cheapest quality there is. For the price, I kind of expected a lesser quality product but not this bad! The chips are plastic with a metal insert. The chip edge is sharp and there are a lot of imperfections on the chip like dirt was mixed in it. Furthermore, the thickness of the chips are UNEVEN. Therefore, when you stack the chips (depending on the color), 5 white chips may be shorter than 5 black chips. The poker case handle broke the first time I lifted it. The chip dividers are loose and the felt material is not glued in properly. This is really a bad product which should be banned from Amazon.Save yourself some grief. Spend a little more money and buy a reputable poker set! What a waste of time and money!"
3,not bad,I wanted a case for runningthat would be sturdy. This case is ok and stays on my waist band well enough. The case itself is flimsy and thewheel sometimes does not work through the plastic front.
1,Horrible product!,"I had the double timer which has been removed from Amazon and it was so horrible I felt I needed to leave a review here! The digital part of the double timer particularly was useless. It never shut off or worked properly. I wrote a letter to OXO's customer service and they said they would replace it but never did. Probably because they were too embarrassed to send out another worthless product. For the record, I own a number of OXO products and believe it's a fantastic company...! If you see this at Ross or some discount store for under $3, don't get it!!! It's not even worth it!!!"
5,I like this timer and am purchasing another one!,This timer works for me. It looks good and is very reliable. I don't have great eyesight but I have no problems using it. I recommend it.
1,Seek sturdier and more reliable option.,"Keys break easily, and with any kind of exposure to moisture, the lock rusts, making it nearly impossible to use. You get what you pay for with this item. Seek a sturdier option!"
4,Good basic lock,good basic lock cheaper than the store easy to install if you want something more secure than your going to have to pay this is not leave overnight in the city lock if you get me its good for a few hours especially if you have a nice bike otherwise its a good basic lock..
1,lock core broke,"I'm not sure if this was because someone tried to pick the lock, but this morning I unlocked my bike, then tried to pull the key out of the lock and the lock core mechanism came 1/2 way out instead. Oops. Now i can't get the key out or the core back in.This lock is about 2 weeks old btw."
3,Lock,"This lock is huge, so it was a problem for me how to care it while my bike rides if i dont take my backpack)"
1,Good way to loose a bike,"My bike was locked right outside my door to a metal railing with this lock. Went out, came back 4 hrs later and bike was gone, all this in broad daylight in the middle of the day. Unlike one of the other reviewers, I dont know how the lock was broken, but if you live in an area where many bikes are stolen, buy a better lock."
1,Terrible,"I have no idea how this lock has any stars. The only thing it has to offer is that it is cheap. My bike was stolen right off my balcony in the middle of the day, while I was out doing some community service of all things. You might as well put a sign on your bike that says ""steal me"" if you use the bell lock. Once I get a new bike, I'm going to get a Kryptonite."
1,"pass this one up, it's a flimsy piece of junk","this phone is by far the worst i've ever come across,it's poorly made,all the buttons don't light up,the caller id display is too small to see and it isn't backlit. if you happen to have a computer connected to the same line,the phone picks up music. music so loud you can barely hear a dial tone over it. i hade to spend another twenty dollars on a RF line filter.id'e send this one back in a heartbeat if i had kept all the boxes. do yourself a favor pass this one up!"
2,A very Ho Hum phone,"This phone has only one good feature, its large buttons. For people with trouble seeing close up, that's important. However, should you decide to buy this phone because of vision difficulties, you're out of luck trying to see the small alphanumeric screen. It's just too dang little! Great thinking, Conair!Add to that the fact that the phone loves batteries, and that the owner's manual gives the wrong instructions on how to enter the setup menu (push the ERASE and the DOWN buttons together)and it's clear that this was a poorly designed and supported phone."
4,sad tale,"started to read and i didnot want the book to disturb my impressions of nataive americans which it could .graphic,,,,,,,"
4,"Great quality, but not really adult size","This hat was surprisingly good quality. Soft and thick material. Great colors.However, it is too small for a typical adult. I bought it for my husband to wear while handing out Halloween candy, but it didn't even fit me. (I don't have an unusually large head or horns or anything that would interfere with wearing a hat sized to ""fit most adults."")The size adjuster on the inside is a nice feature for kids, though. It's a soft strip that will cinch the inside hat band tighter. It's covered by a sleeve of soft material, so it looks like it wouldn't bother a kid to use it.Again, great quality hat, but it won't fit most full grown wizards."
3,Decent Read,"After having read ""Love in the Time of Cholera,"" this book was certainly a step down. Although there are a few interesting passages worthy of deeper thought and discussions, overall the book isn't as captivating as his more popular works."
5,Great book!,I enjoyed this book very much. Dee does a great job of painting an accurate picture of the military and the relationships that can be formed....
3,So-So,"I am an AVID Dee Henderson fan, and I just have to say that this book just wasn't up to par. I LOVE the 1st and 3rd ones in the Uncommon Heroes series, and the O'Malley series kept me enthralled, but this book lacked some of the magic. I didn't feel the chemistry between Bruce and Gracie the way I know Henderson is capable of creating between characters. The letters were a bit slow, too.Having said that, it's still a good read with some good military action. A fun book, just not an on-the-edge of your seat book like her others. I suggest any other of her books instead."
3,"I liked it, but...","I have read all of the other books written by Dee Henderson. The O'Malleys are great and the first Uncommon Heroes books was superb. True Valor left something to be desired. The book starts out slow and the way that the storyline goes it seems like this book is more about Jilly and Wolf instead of being a budding romance between Bruce and Gracie. I like the book, don't get me wrong, but this story moves slower and lacks the action and adventure that other books by Dee Henderson contain. To be honest, the best character in the book is Emily, the elderly Lab. I'm waiting eagerly for the third Uncommon Heroes book. Maybe I will like that better."
1,YUK!,By far the worst Dee Henderson book I have read. I have always enjoyed her books - but this one just puts me to sleep!
2,It's ok but.....,"Takes some getting used too, it obstructs your pedalling somewhat but at least the pain caused by the other seats stop. By the third ride you won't notice it once you get it adjusted properly."
4,Stick with the Original: Basic Training,"I bought Jon Giswold's ""Basic Training"" and I thought it was a great book to use in starting out a workout program. I thought that ""Beyond Basic Training"" would build on ""Basic Training"". Instead, Beyonnd Basic Training sort of goes off in a different direction. While Jon Giswold still has some great advice, this books doesn't seem as well structured as Basic Training. Beyond Basic Training is useful, but just in the same way that Basic Training was."
5,"Readable as a story, but actually very complex.","Amazing read. This book can be read on many levels, and thought about for a long time. I grew up in small town Missouri and can relate to the themes around how farming has and is still changing, the spiritual significance of our natural world, conservation, and the interdependency of the human race."
5,Excellent....beautiful,"This is the first book I have read by Wendell Berry and I know it will certainly not be the last.A beautiful story, sensitive writing, an exquisite novel. LOVED it."
4,Interesting Book,Wendell Berry does a great job explaining the life of this barber from a small town. The book is intriguing to see what life looks like in a small town along the river. It is a really interesting picture of life in the early 20th century. Very easy to read and I would say worth checking out.
4,Shrapnal`s review,Boba fett didn`t die in the pit of carcoon. He escaped after finding out about the inteligent life form inside the salaac. That`s why he was able to be written about in this extreme comic book. Action is kept up through the intire book. It prooves Boba Fett`s skill and power. I love the literature that is used by all of the main people. Boba fett`s calm atmosphere makes his killings seem athentic to his personality. YOU GOTTA READ THIS BOOK!
1,12 packs not shipped correctly.,"I ordered this 12 pack twice but, on both occasions only received 1 filter. Amazon could not correct this after 2 tries and now the product is unavailable. To get a refund of the $25 price I now need to send the filter that I did receive back. This is unfortunate as it was a great price for twelve 5 star products."
2,What happened to her?!?,"She was kinda cutesy back in the day with ""Smile"", then she sassed up for her appearance in the movie ""Get Over It"". Did anyone else see her on MadTV? She was dressed up in a short little top and matching short little blue faux snakeskin outfit. Her vocals? They sound like Britney Spears, with not nearly as much of her own singing as there should have been. There's a difference between being sexy and having side slits on your miniskirt that go all the way up your thighs. Now, I'll admit, I've worn sexy clothes before. I'm not a 35 year old mom with kids who blames Britney Spears for my little girl wanting to dress like a 25 year old stripper. Basically, here's my thing. If you're going to come out and be sweet and pretty and melodic and PG-13, stay that way. If you're going to be sleazy and use your scantily clad body to sell albums, then do it. But don't come out sweet and then turn into a tart."
5,OPEN YOUR EYES TO WHAT'S OUT THERE,"I always like reading books by this author. He gives important information to women and children as to what is lurking around out there. He is upfront with his stories and so many lessons can be learned by the reader as to how not to be a victim. I recommend this book to everyone to boost their confidence, and that we all have the power to be safe."
5,A must for all Parents,This is an excellent eye-opening book that proves useful to parents of boys or girls in all ages groups.Great to keep as a resource.
4,add to your library if you're a parent,"Gift of Fear is a must read for everyoneProtecting the gift is a must read for parents. Gavin De Becker has a great writing style that engages and informs in a clear, no nonsense and insightful way. There are tips that appeal to our common sense and then other tips that I may never have known had I not read this book. I've got a lot highlighted and it's helped me shape conversations I will have with my kids when the time comes."
1,Pathetic just got a new definition,"I read this book because I thought the subject sounded interesting...How wrong i was....Gavin De Becker Suceeds not only in feeding the irrational fear and paranoia, he also does this in an extremely superficial manner. This book skould be listed under the ""Exploting irrational fear for bucks"" section.It seems like hte author is a skilled writer in the pop-psychology genre."
1,Not a good investment,This has been the worst thing I have ever bought. I have replaced the heat rod 4 times in less than 2 years (I only use it once a month at most) and now the automatic feeder has stopped working. I have to take it apart and clean it out every time before I use it. It stays on a covered porch and I keep it covered when not in use. I would not recommend this thing to anyone!
1,garbage,"I bought my bradley smoker in April had nothing but problems with it ,it never worked right . The company keeps sending me parts to replace , but it still doesn't work , they refuse to send me another one so I threw it out and bought a Masterbuilt now I am happy"
2,Faulty heater,"I loved my new smoker when it was working. Whole chicken, prime rib and hot salmon were awesome. Unfortunately, it only lasted 6 smokes and the heater quit working."
2,A disapointing account of Vietnam.,"This author misses the mark completely. His account gives none of the day to day feel of the misery and discomfort of living in the field in Vietnam and putting life on the line every day. His recollections are so stale and based on one line journal entrys that they never live up to the promise. I was sorry to see him fall in to the I ""I was the best"" trap that so many first hand accounts fall into. He clearly wasn't the best, nor was his platoon any better than most. His glee at hearing that a Col who chewed him out for getting too many men blown up in a booby trap had been shot down and seriously injured was, to say the least, morbid! They are too many good first hand accounts available to waste time on this one."
2,Arrived Broken,"This thing arrived in a box with many other items and all were completely fine, except the thermometer. It seems as it if shipped broken because there is no damage to the box at all.ot worth it to return it and get another. Will just buy locally."
2,Disappointed...,"After reading & loving Dust Devil by Rebecca Brandewyne, I went in search of more books by her. Heartland is one of the books I picked up & I hate to admit it but I was very disappointed. Like another reviewer I felt that the book was way too wordy & descriptive. I felt like the book could've been cut in half with all the excessive descriptions taken out. I also wasn't big on the ending being laid right out at the beginning & the storyline never really caught my interest. I've never found my mind wondering as much as I did with this book. And the ""Head-hopping"" that somebody else mentioned drove me crazy as well. On one page you'd jump back in forth between several people's heads. This usually doesn't drive me crazy but I felt that it wasn't done very smoothly & it was done way too often. From a romance reviewer who reads 50+ romances a year the best recommendation I can give is to pass on this book."
2,Mostly Overlookable,"Wow. Perhaps I'm just missing some awesome thing about the Stooges, but I was thoroughly unimpressed by this album. I only found 2 tracks that were listenable, ""1969"" and ""No Fun"" both of which sound pretty mainstream for the time period. The rest was some bizarrely boring attempt at being progressive or intriguing that in my opinion failed. I can't say too little about this album."
1,Ugh...,"This is the same duo of ""translators"" who massacred the poetry of Victor Hugo recently. Wretched English ""verse"" adaptations insult the originals to their face. Infinitely superior (and more extensive) is THE PENGUIN BOOK OF FRENCH POETRY, which includes faithful and readable prose translations in a similar format."
1,Good...if it actually worked,"Before ordering this grooming system, I read many reviews on how the battery is no good and how it dies out really quickly, but i chose to ignore the reviews and buy it since it was so inexpensive. I should have just payed a little extra for a better grooming kit because the reviews were right for once. I've had it for about a month, used it 3 times and it died on me while I was using it the third time. I was trimming my beard when I realized the vibration was getting softer and quieter when it eventually just stopped. Plugged it into the outlet and it would start up again before dying out in 5 seconds. Do yourself a favor and buy something that has some longevity to it. I plan on calling Philips and getting my money back since they do a 45 day refund if you are unsatisfied"
3,Parts break,I bought this item for about $15 at Target. It lasted a while but the plastic head attachments began to break. The replacement parts on the Phillips site cost more than the entire item. Would not purchase again.
4,Good tool for bearded men,"The grooming system is good for maintaining a beard. The small shaver is good for removing growth in the parts of the face that you do not want bearded. The trimming system (a small and a large trimmer) are good for trimming beard edges. The large trimmer has a calibrated comb that allows you to trim the hair on the top of the head. That is good for cutting down the number of haircuts that you need. With another setting you can also trim the beard (I wear a fairly short facial beard) The nose and ear hair trimmer works, but not perfectly. It is noisy when you trim in the ears - I was nervous whether there was the potential of damaging hearing. It also requires many passes to get at all the hairs. I use the small trimmer initially to remove long hears and then I follow up with the nose and ear trimmer. The charger is not a hi-tech charger. It only works on US voltages, and there is no protection for the NiCad batteries"
2,Bad quality,"I've had this ""system"" for a couple years now, and I've just had the last straw with it so I threw it against the bathroom wall and smashed it to pieces. What happened? Well, tolerating this POS just became too much, and it painfully pulled another nose hair for the last time. The actual cutting surfaces are dull and pull your hair more than cut it clean. Everytime I use it I end up drawing blood somewhere. It's just cheap... and painful. You can't use it if it is plugged in, which is useless if the battery dies, and it takes a full day to charge. Useless. Hair easily gets inside the attachment area.Yes it will trim hair, with all kinds of crappy attachments. They should have given a couple quality attachments, rather than 6 dull surfaces."
3,Powerful & Versatile,"I purchased this trimmer to use on my arm hair, chest, and face. It had high reviews on amazon and was priced very fairly. Once the item arrived I unpacked it and tested it out.It is strong,sharp,and precise. My biggest complaint is that there are no good heads for facial hair. The heads are decided more for body hair and head hair. If you want nice clean lines this will work but only if you're looking at doing a 0 or .5."
5,Great product!,This product is amazing for the price. The lithium ion battery is better than having AA batteries all the time. A++ product!
1,The adjustable head is very easy to broken,"I just use two times, because my hair is dense the head is very hard to pull out from shaver, it broke soon. I wonder if possible to buy some new adjustable head or my shaver is not useful at all."
1,It failed to charge after the initial charge!,I followed the manual. It failed to charge after the initial charge. I sent 2 of these units back and got the 3rd unit right now. I have no idea what was causing this issue but I don't think I can recommend this to anyone. I found similar charging issues reported elsewhere online. Do your research before investing in this low cost grooming system.
2,okay for what i paid for,Just okay for what i paid for. If you can cough up a few more bucks get a better one
2,Very good for the price if it lasted,"Does a very good job at what it does, and the price is very low.I would have given it 5 stars if it had lasted one year.It lasted 3 months: the battery died, and it no longer works even attached to the power cord..."
4,good trimmer,"As the general consensus seemed to indicate that this was the best value for money, I bought this and haven't been disappointed. There is a large number of useful attachments and although I haven't used all of them the hair trimmer with different lock settings, the mini trimmer and the mini shaver have worked as well as I expected.There are also some useful information on the info sheet. The extensions all fit in the attachment stand (which looks like it could have been sturdier) pretty snugly and while cleaning the extensions after is slightly bothersome it is nothing too bad especially considering the price.As the top reviewer said the plastic clam shell packaging was a bother and I came off with a couple of scratches from trying to open it with a pair of scissors while making sure I did not cut up the info sheet. I have yet to figure out why companies still insist on using these."
5,awesome,"first of all ...i live outside US so like many people from different countries, i had concerns whether it would work or not with 220V AC....?answer is IT WILL NOT WORK ...so you will require a step down 220 to110v converter.i love it ...very cheap ,durable,versatile and does the job perfectly...i use for beard trimming,nose .somebody told me he used it for 4 yrs and still working.recommended for anyone who has any Hair on the body !"
3,Ho-hum,"Cons - button that pops off the top for putting different grooming cap on is right above the on/off button, and easily hit, because just as big in different shape. Should have put it on the back.To remove the mustache trimmer to just use the blade, common when trimming, you must slide the whole trimmer assembly off, using depth level button to remove. That probably won't last long. Previous trimmer the whole head assembly came off maintaining the setting.Pluses - decent selection of other trimmer types to replace, though ease of carrying/storing them has not been found yet."
5,Saved me a lot of money!,"I use this product regularly, and it has saved me a good deal of money in haircuts. I have used products that need to be plugged in, and this is far superior. The performance is excellent, and being cordless means I can use it where it is convenient for me. It comes with more attachments than I need, but the storage caddy keeps the system neat. I have been impressed with the battery life. I use it for a weekly haircut, and the battery stays charged for a month."
4,Great product,"This grooming system is a really good experience, all the accesories are well designed thinkin of men needs. Its a shame that the system has not came with its cradle."
3,"Nice product, but lack of travel lock is frustrating","I really wanted to like this product. The attachments were generally useful (apart from the ear trimmer), but on the two trips I made with it, it turned on in my checked in luggage, so when I reached my destination, it had zero charge left.If you're never planning to travel with it, I think it will do the job, but otherwise, I went with the QT4070"
4,it's awesome - I love it!,"this is my second purchase of this shaver, used the other for four years before I needed to replace. Only reason gave it 4/5 stars is because it doesn't come with a stand."
4,Works great,Have only used it a couple of times but the battery lasts long enough for my needs and it cuts well.
5,Love it,This trimmer is incredible considering the price that I paid for it. I have had it for about 3 months already and do not have 1 bad thing to say about it. Thanks for the great product!
3,The price was cheap and so is the assembly...,It's just OK I guess... I had a Remington that seemed to work better but I ended up looking for a different model as that one broke on me.
3,This product is great!,This is one of the best products we have bought in a long time. My husband loves it! I only gave it 3 stars because we had some customer service issues. Other than that it is great.
3,Not Bad...But Could Be Better,I've been using Philips Norelco for some time now and my last one died on me after 7 years of daily use. This one is ok but not nearly as powerful as my previous.
3,died in less than a year,The product is basically good for the price. i only used this twice a month but already died in 10 months (or 20 times of usage). Performance is acceptable but it won't last long.
4,Would groom again,My boyfriend bought this and is very happy with it. It has Lots of attachments and is easy to use.
2,Disappointing blade,"I got this awhile ago to replace another sub-par product I had. I don't have a full beard or mustache; I just try and keep a very neat, short goatee, and some stubble, and also prefer the option to ""clean it up"" once in awhile. This product does not allow for this at all. The default blades do not cut close enough to the skin, whereas the shaver pulls hairs instead of shaving them. There's no way to get a clean line across with any of the attachments, something that my older entry level Remington could do (I only replaced it because the attachment broke, but that's a different story).Bottom line is I wouldn't recommend this product. I'd spend a little more on one that had a sharp trimmer that produced sharp, clean edges."
1,A very bad experience,"Good morning,I ordered Bruce Catton's three-volume set The Army of the Potomac, and was billed for all three volumes. Only one volume arrived, however. I tried to contact Gr8lakes Books, but received no response. I finally contacted American Express to explain the situation. AMEX deducted two-thirds of the charge from my account, I paid for the book I received over the telephone during the conversation with AMEX.The entire charge was only $9.30; the amount I actually paid was $3.10. I never did hear anything from Gr8lakes Books. I hope they do not try to charge me for anything additional. I don't know if they are very inefficient or just dishonest.With thanks,David A. Johnson"
4,Best album i got for a while :),"I'd only give this album 3.5/5 but that don't mean it ain't worth gettin'. Cham is about as close as u'll get these days to being lyrical down south apart from Ludacris, T.I or Lil' Flip. His rhyme style is great and has the lyrics to occompany the beats (very rare now days). A few songs should have been excluded from this album (personal opinion) but definatley worth gettin'Top 5:Fly As The SkyRidin'Turn It UpThe Sound Of RevengeGrown And Sexy (commercial track but addictive hook)"
5,This is Tight!!!,"I got this CD the first day it came out, and I just reveiwed the wrong one. I thought they all had 21 track's and 2 CD's, but now I look over here, and I see I got the limited edition FREEKIN SWEET!!! Anyway. I hop chamillionaire goes 2X plat with this, cause this album is soooo tight, one of the best ive ever hered. And I wanna see another mainstream follow up by him."
4,The Sound Of Revenge....,"This album is a big step up from ""The Mixtape Messiah"". Chamillionaire is definitely hot!!! My favorite tracks are ""Southern Takeover"" and ""Ridin'"", showin love to some of da legends (pastor troy & krayzie bone) PROPS 4 DAT!!! I'm feelin da collabos w/ Bun B(President Of Da Souf),Pastor Troy,Killer Mike,Lil Wayne,Krayzie Bone everybody!!!diz is a hot album, make sure you add this to yo dirty souf collection!!!-erika-"
2,chamillionaire,Besides the title song this guys got nothing. Not a very good rapper in my opinion. Save your money and just buy the song on itunes
2,"His Flow ain't bad,but the beats are kinda corny","Chamillionaire got some Bangers on here&His Flows ain't bad.digging some of the Lyrics,but the Beats leave alot to be desired.if this cat gets hooked up with the right Beat-maker or a Legit Producer than there is Potential for a really good album."
5,Texas on da Rise,"Chamillionaire holds it down 4 H-Town, all i can say is this album is worth every penny. Go buy ths album, u wont be disappointed."
2,Not true to size...,"These slippers are cozy and warm. Unfortunately, they do not fit ""true to size"" and run small. It is too bad these are not made in half sizes."
2,a fall into the dark!,"Everybody who knows Dean Konntz knows he can do a lot better. I have read nearly every novel he wrote, and some were real masterpieces. But this one is not: the characters are not really credible, their behavior is unmotivated and the love affair described altogether unrealistic in its motivation and execution. The horror displayed is that of cheap movies and lacks the refined ideas of Koontz other stories. The plot sometimes makes the impression as if the author was asked to fill in some more words. The ending is not an organic one that reflects the main plot, but one that suggests that the author had run out of fantasy when he wrote it. The idea could have been good, but the performance is really bad. I grant two stars, because I know that Dean is much better. everybody is allowed to fail once in a while."
3,3 1/2 STARS...,"WHAT R U PEOPLE TALKING ABOUT???Novice dialogue? DK has a reputation as having witty repartee without peers!... Koontz creates believeable characters and puts them in unreal situations. He does this and has no peer!Sure, this isn't his BEST BOOK, but it's still better than what is passing for horror fiction THESE DAYS!!! Check out Ron Dee and so many others, then tell me DK can't write! Or better yet try WRITING!!Koontz writes a great read for a dark and stormy night!! The story does bog down at times, but is still very enjoyable and gobble-able (Is that a word?).An early novel that shows he has what it takes to compete with those in the SCREAM FACTORY!!"
3,OK book,This is more for kids than adults. But I bought it so I read it. I do like Dean Koontz other books.
4,Another Entertaining Novel by Dean Koontz,"Darkfall was a very vividly written and entertaining novel to read. I decided to give it four stars because in my opinion, it is not one of Mr. Koontz's best books. The storyline was good and the synopsis of the book was very intrigueing. For some reason it just didn't ""suck me in"" to the degree that some of his other books have. The characters were a little on the ""flat"" side and more difficult to relate too. I think if the book was longer and provided more details about the characters, they would have endeared themswelves more to me. With that said, it is still a wonderful suspenseful, thriller, that is a fairly quick read. The author just didn't leave me wanting more like he usually does. I would still recommend purchasing and reading this book. If you are a Dean Koontz fan, don't expect it to live up to the quality of some of his other novels such as WATCHERS and PHANTOMS. Those two are truly phenomenal pieces of modern literature."
2,Skip this one,"I usually like Koontz, but not this one. There is absolutely no suspense, no mystery, and the characters are one dimensional. The most shocking thing in the book had nothing to do with the creatures or voodoo-- it was to find out that the two bland leading characters had feelings for each other.I almost always finish books (including other Koontz books) in one or two sittings. This has been sitting around for a couple of months. I eventually got all the way to the last chapter and haven't yet been motivated enough to read these last five pages.:("
2,"Koontz: Master of Suspense, Novice of Intelligent Dialogue","OK, I did enjoy most of the chase scenes and the early appearances of the monsters. But the rest of the story was very poorly written. The main characters were incredibly two dimensional and the dialogue was some of the worst I've ever read. Audible groaning is usually a sign that a book is bad for me. Death threat on your kids? Not to worry, you still have time for a giddy, childish romp with one of the worst written females in novel history. Good idea but bad execution, this truly is Koont's dark fall."
2,Remember Biloxi Blues???,"Do you remember the movie Biloxi Blues, starring Matthew Broderick and christopher Walken? This book was exactly the same in terms of a story that takes off in flying colors then completely deflates. It GRABBED my imagination immediately! Within the first few chapters it genuinely tweaked my curiosity hook, line and sinker. I was mesmerized; great suspense. Did I mention this was within the first few chapters? Yeah. The rest of the book went flat and cheesy, especially when voodoo magic came into play. I probably could have lived with that, had the main character not become an instant master himself, saving the day with his own pure self-sacrifice of blood. Sigh. What a weak, unimaginative ending. Wasted potential."
2,Great cup but straw is too flexible,I bought this cup when my 17 month old started to drink from straws. Overall the cup is pretty nice. My little boy loves to drink from it and press the button so it lights up.The reason I gave the cup only two stars is that the straw has major issues. The problem comes when I slide close the lid to throw the cup in the diaper bag. When I try to open the straw portion back up the straw gets pushed back too. By this I mean the straw is caught in the sliding portion of the lid. Sometimes I can pull it back out but there have been times I have had to remove the top portion of the cup and pull the straw completely out and reinsert it to fix the problem.I've personally solved this issue by just using the cup around the house and therefore eliminating any reason to slide close the lid.
3,easy to use,"I like this software because it was easy to use. There is interactive help for it available online. There are a few issues with it,however. The titling and Intro screens are clunky and not good quality. The voice over requires a recording program, which I found online called Goldwave, which is EXCELLENT! The MPEG2 recording would not play on all CD readers and the write to CD function didn't work on my machine. For the money it's not bad, there aren't alot of choices out there for this kind of software at the consumer level."
3,Fun one,"It's always fun to see 80s cult movies without too much expectation. The plots are usually light, with heavy visuals. Diane is adorable here in a gritty way. The Looters are awesome (clearly a version of the real Professionals) and Ray Winstone is amazingly believable as an English punk. I found the ending wierd but there's a certain authenticity to the portrayal of the time period that give the film credibility."
2,Nostalgia creates such good memories... but...,"Nostalgia creates such good memories... but... if one is to be honest, this film is really quite bad. Yes it's interesting to see a very young Laura Dern and Diane Lane but it certainly wasn't as funny or poignant as I remember. It's also odd that many a young female post-punk hopeful find this film such an inspiration when ultimately the movie is about anything but music. I liked Waybill and Welnick, but their parts were tiny, and everyone else's performance was entirely forgettable. When you're 16 this movie might be good, when you're older it's quite horrendous. Maybe that's the point? Either way I was basically reminded of what a lousy era for music the early 80's really were, and that no matter how good the memories you associate with a given film or music, it doesn't make that film or music particularly good.If this is an official DVD release, there'd better be a slew of compelling special features to counter-balance the main feature."
5,An incredible story.,"Anton is a man that is sure to rise to the top. The problem is he isn't who they think he is. In a world controlled by genetics only the elite can succeed. One man decides he will achieve his dreams even if he has to lie to do it. He meets a woman who is in a similar situation. The fall in love, but have they fallen in love with a lie. Will the achieve their dreams together, or will they be cast out of society and never find happiness.This movie is an amazing amazing drama. Ethan Hawke, Uma Thurman, and Jude Law play amazing roles. This is a very tense, emotional, and touching movie. It is one of those that really inspires you to do your best. The production quality is great, the story is original, the dialogue, is incredible, and the emotions overflow. Gattaca is an unforgettable movie. You can't miss it."
2,"Watch ""The Robot Monster"" first, it may make this seem good","Whew! Couldn't hardly stay awake in the middle of the day to finish this boredom classic. Business suited astronauts huh? If you're interested in seeing a society that should have been nuked, this is your group. Flat, dull, boring non-personality's trying to go to outer space. Even some good visual work doesn't help much. Can you say ""bow-wow""?"
5,The best movie I have ever seen--without a doubt,"This movie is extraordinary. It's filled with beautiful symbolism of the human will, the plot is supurb, and the acting is top-notch. I myself like sci fi...but that is not the reason I liked this movie at all...in fact...the movie isn't really much of a sci fi film to begin with. I have seen this film several times...and I can not find any flaws in it whatsoever...everything is perfectly fit together."
3,Interesting Perspective,This is an interesting look at Genetics taken to the extreme in a future that could be dominated by it's use.
4,This was a good movie,"Trying to find a good movie now days is kind of hard, so many of then is a waste of time. This one I wasn't so sure about either but I found it to have a good story line and it kept me interested. It had a good ending to it."
4,ONE OF 1997'S BEST FLICKS!,"I was not expecting this film to have as much heart put into the story as it did. I was stunned that Columbia/Tristar released this fine piece of work. Andrew Niccol took an incredible yet disturbing vision of the future and turned into one of the most original and entertaining films of 1997. I recently saw Mr. Niccol's newest shot at the big screen, ""The Truman Show"" and once again was not disappointed.We need more people like Andrew Niccol to write using their imagination and not for the sake of special effects. Thanks Andrew!! END"
5,thought provoking...,"good science fiction, usually is - but off late science fiction movies have tended to focus on special effects and other CGI sizzle. other than a pre-occupation with armani clothing, this one really focusses on some meaty topics.the central one - how much does society's expectation of success actually influence (either positively or negatively) the actual achievement of success - is an interesting one in the is world of assessment and categorization that we live in. or in simpler words - what makes folks succeed - good genes or internal drive?the film definitely has a point of view and gently pushes it's premise. i, and friends of mine who had watched the film, found ourselves rethinking a few assumptions. not a bad result for a hollywood film.and if all that is too much heaviness for you, don't worry. ethan hake, uma thurman and jude law in all that armani certainly make nice eye candy."
5,Ready to Watch Again,"Gattaca, is one of the most incredible movies to ever come around. Never before has such a though provoking movie touched me the way this one did. It explored some of the thought renching moral dillemas(biomedical experimentation) we have in our country right now, it also explores the postive and negative side of the issue, which I believe is what the director/writer meant to do. The director cptures his audience every step of the way by not letting a minute go by that doesn't add superb picture quality, incredible sound and of course incredible acting. It doesn't matter what kind of genre you are into you will be captivated by this movie and not want to move."
4,"Well done, Underrated Thriller","Jude Law shines over Hawke and Thurman in this well-crafted film with great cinematography, brooding mood, and emotional resonance. There are few jarring logical flaws, such as a laughably outdated identification technology and that a spinal injury can only be remedied in the future by a suicide. However, it's an unusually intelligent and absorbing sci-fi film at par with ""The Arrival""."
4,the future is now ????,"this 1997 movie is a good movie, and deals with a societythat has a caste system, and the possibilities that it maybe in our near future, ethan hawke gives a strong performanceand a cameo by earnest borgnine was a surprise."
2,reverse racism is still racism...,"...and it's not an attractive trait in a hero. That's my first and major problem with this book. Another issue was that Ms. Palmer spent the first 3 chapters explaining the characters and their circumstances over and over. The next was that our hero, Tate, went through much of the book as an angry man. That gets very old. Further, for characters who place so much value on honesty, they certainly spent enough time lying.This book is standard Palmer fare. The heroine is virginal and scared of sex, the hero is forceful and dark-complexioned. There were some plot holes and odd decisions that further weakened this book, yet, I can't pan it entirely because it was an all right read. The hero even explains his decision to make racist decisions, but it was too little and too late for me to believe it.There are some old Palmer books where her formula works very well. This isn't one of them. I won't be reading the next one in the series."
5,This book is a must have for anyone interested in Aromatherapy!,"I just bought this book, as well as ""The Fragrant Mind"", and I love them both! They are wonderfully written books, that are enjoyable to read, as well as extremely informative.I highly recommend these books (and any others by Valerie Ann Worwood) to anyone interested in Aromatherapy...whether you're just starting to learn about it, or someone who has a lot of experince with Aromatherapy. If you were to own only two books on Aromatherapy, these would be the two to have!"
4,Really Good!!,My mom really liked this book it has everything she was looking for and was very apreciative for this book!! thanks goes out to everone in this company for sending this top quality product!!Complete Book of Essential Oils and AromaTherapy - Aromatherapy & Oils
2,Just not there,"This is a good reference book for the physical aspects of aromatherapy. However all positives stop there. She does not explain the oils and their function or contradictions. There is nothing about the effects of the oils on emotions or moods. The recipes include too many oils as I was taught the more simple the recipe the more effective, I.E no more than three E.O's, this book has recipes that have over 6 different oils, and she fails to explain why the oils in the recipe work. Not one mention of Rosewood or Ylang ylang. I disagree with the selection of oils. Over all I was disappointed with this book. It's a good book for a home remedy kit. Not a good book for an Aromatherapist."
3,Very general and requires a complete oils list,"I would like to say this was help in my introduction to Aromatherapy, but it requires you own hundreds of oils to select from. Many are very expensive, and some are hard to find. Then leaves something like Tangerine out all together. I would also like to have seen more on which oils are for burning in diffusers and which are for message. It seems that most are for message and that might be great for many folks but I was looking for a more diverse introduction. An advanced user or someone into message therapy might feel differently, but it seemed it cut many subjects short leaving the reader wondering whether to message the oil in or burn it, or make soap out of it..."
4,one minor flaw; all else wonderful,"This is an amazing book and a wonderful reference on aromatherapy. The only reason why I gave it four stars instead of five is because Worwood uses a lot of British terms for diseases that have different names here over in the United States, and provided no explanation or translation of those British terms. However, she IS a British author; I can't fault her too much for using the terms popular in her own culture. Apart from that one minor flaw though, this is an excellent book and I would recommend it to anyone with an interest in aromatherapy."
4,Great Book!,Everything you would want to know about essential oils. Its a book I go to on a daily basis . I have this book in hard copy and on my kindle!
3,No Safety,"The book is filled with some good information. However, There is no safety data for the oils presented. Some oils are not safe to use during pregnancy, estrogen dependent cancer, or may cause skin irritation or phototoxicity (sunburn). Use caution when trying the recipies in this book or research the oils further.A disturbing section was the one on pets. I would definately do more research before putting anything on a cat. Cats lick their fur and not all oils can be ingested. Eucalyptus is toxic if taken internally. There have been reports of Tea Tree nearly killing cats. In addition, they recommended adding tansy to a horse's feed to treat worms. Tansy is very toxic to horses and cows. People usually try to remove the plant from their pastures.Last word. Do your research and don't just use one book."
2,Flat,"I would have preferred if this book would have been written in invisible ink. Maybe I have read too many books of this genre, but I am beginning to become tired of the much used stereotypes and standard sub plots. The best thing that I can say about the book that it was enough of a story to keep me reading hoping it would pick up and finally I was so far into the book I have to finish it."
5,Nothing out there compares,"This thing is just incredible! I work in the sound-engineering and the theatre business so I carry my Charge with me everywhere I go. This one tool goes in and out of it's sheath every few minutes. I love the easy open knives and how everything locks. The quality of the tools are incredible. I have sawed through a 2x4 with the Charge saw in seconds, the knife can cut anything thrown at it, the serrated knife is a beast, and the cutting hook can tackle the toughest wires. The tools inside are a plus too, I carry around the bit pieces for the screwdrivers and I have never encountered a need to carry screwdrivers around anymore! This tool is lightweight and VERY durable, the pliers are very solid unlike other multi-tool companies.This product gets a score of 5/5, I'd give it extra if it allowed me. The Charge XTI is every handyman's best friend!"
1,Bad choice.,Wouldn't recommend or buy again. Camera started going haywire and changing menus/settings on it's own making it unable to take a picture. Hate that it doesn't take a standard SD card. Never Sony again.
2,All MP are not created equal,"I love how most people find reviews helpful just because they are positive, even though they might be erroneous or misleading. The Sony DSC-W100 has MARKEDLY worse picture quality than my one-year old Sony DSC-W5 which has just 5 MP. Cost cutting is rampant now. You have been warned. Get a Canon instead."
1,What you pay for.,"I should have spent more money, I think. I couldn't get the obsolete software, or the device to work. I fiddled with that thing for hours, and then simply gave up. I'm not really a total dummy, but I wonder what those folks who got good results did that I didn't."
3,Interesting,"Perhaps in the hands of Alfred Hitchcock, this film could have been a classic.As such, it is interesting if you have nothing else to do.Definitely buy used."
2,"If you want the real story, read the book","This film was based -- and based only very loosely -- on the book, ""Rogue Male,"" by Geoffrey Household. The result was a movie that bore little or no resemblance to the original story, and that's a shame, because ""Rogue Male"" is a whopper of a story, a real page turner. The movie is almost nothing like it.As a stand-alone movie, ""Manhunt"" is okay, but I would recommend that you NOT read the book first, because you will be sorely disappointed by the film. But if you really, really want adventure and a knockout story, read ""Rogue Male"" and forget Hollywood's bastardization of it."
3,Missleading description.,"THis item, if properly described, would have been more helpful to me in deciding to buy it. TO supply power to it can only be done throught a cigarette lighter in your car. The seller knows this and intentionally has misled the public. It mearly states that is comes with a power adaptor, which is fixed to the unit, which is ok.. but not for the purposes that one would like.. a further description of its usage is also important such as the items going into it MUST be prechilled. this unit mearly maintains its coolness, which is basically fine for why it was purchased.. but now I have to buy the power adaptor so I may plug into a wall which costs $15.95 on amazon and you don't benefit from any supersaving shipping charges..HAD I had known this in advance, I would have purchased both items.Wagan EL2260 6-Liter Personal Fridge / Warmer"
3,Watch out for the optional ac adaptor,"If you are going to use this fridge outside of your car, you have to pay extra for the AC adaptor. I overlooked this and had to pay a 2nd shipping fee to buy that piece."
5,581 st ARC Wing korea and phillippines clark field,"I was in that oufit the 581st and colonel Arnold was my comanding officer..he got shot down on our first mission, and i learned details I did not knowabout.. I am sharing it with my fellow airman that I was stationed with.thank you...J J Hyde"
3,Unfortunately Disappointing,"After reading the first book of this saga 'Hearts Passage' which I very much enjoyed. I ordered this one and was looking forward to finishing up some of the stories that were left open after the first book. I am sorry to say that although some things were finished I found the storyline was rather weak . Which is a real shame but this is only my opinion and I wouldn't say it was that bad that you shouldn't try to read it, just wasn't what I enjoy."
2,Disappointingly drab,"I had hoped for a detailed, accurate accounting with authentic pictures. This production was drab, uninteresting and with boring re-enactments. Not everyone viewed the Holocaust as a bad thing."
5,Best Perfume!,"I love E'clat D'arpege! The scent is absolutely perfectly lovely and light. Unlike some perfumes, it doesn't make me sneeze or give me a headache. But, the scent is still strong enough that it stays with me for the day--it's great to have a perfume that doesn't overwhelm me and everyone else around, but is still noticeable to the point that I get compliments on it all the time!!! I've had so many people ask me for the name of the scent so that they can buy it."
5,10 of 10,"This ""Jet Spray Nozzle"" is of excellent craftsmanship in every way. It almost makes any job that requires its use, enjoyable.It's made of Brass with rubber which makes it easy to handle. The fact that it's balanced is also a plus.I haven't seen anything that can compare. We previously had one that was twice the price, guarenteed to last forever (ha, possibly 3 years). I'm sure this will be around a long time giving us good use.I highly recomend this to any one looking for a good ""all purpose"" nozzle."
1,"These are gross, don't buy these.","Seriously, these are the worst pills I have ever taken. To understand what they taste like, find a spice container of garlic powder. Fill up a teaspoon of it. Eat it. Repeat.Make sure you purchase garlic capsules, not tablets. Natrol's capsules are fine; these things are the worst garlic supplements ever."
4,Not as good as Prisoner of Azkaban.,"Harry Potter and the Goblet of Fire is a decent video game, but it is a little more restricting in where your character can go compared to the previous Harry Potter game, Prisoner of Azkaban. Overall, though it is still a fun game to play if you are a Harry Potter fan."
2,Goblet of Fire - Big Disappointment,I had high hopes for this game after playing/beating Prizoner of Azkaban several times. I was looking forward to finding new clues and searching the castle some more...but this game is a big-time letdown.The best part about it is that you can play 3 players at a time. You can't switch between the characters; you are forced to choose one at the beginning of a round.Go out and rent the game - don't buy it!! I'm interested to see how bad they screw up Order of the Phoenix.
1,WASTE OF MONEY,"You must be thinking that this game is very cool,you get to play the three tasks and face voldemort. BUT NO! you do not face voldemort in this game. Voldemort just summonds these skulls and you have to kill them.Youu dont really duel him at all.THe three tasks are bad too. The first task you have to run away from the dragon on your broom. THats fun. But the other two are not. YOU just collect gillyweed in the second task. Thats all. The third task is HORRIBLE! You just fight 2 monsters.Thats all. You cant even go around hogwarts. You just keep beating levels. EA games made a piece of JUNK!"
2,Totally different style than first 3...,"If you liked the first 3 harry potter games because of the exploring, hunting, puzzle solving, etc. this is NOT the game for you. I love the 1st three games and was very disappointed with this one. If you are more into very action packed games that don't require much thinking, this is the game for you. It's mainly a lot of button mashing without much strategy."
1,horrible videogame!,"The book and film of goblet of fire were good, but this game is awful! i tought that it would be great, but it isnt! the hogwartz levels are awful! the triwizard levels are, well, good, but they still dont make this a great game. what an awful game this is."
5,"Lovely, quiet, and contemporary","I purchased this fan last year for our master bedroom. It was easily installed using the in-place center overhead light, and looks just like our maple floors. Yes, it is plastic, but you certainly can't tell by its looks. I've told people it's plastic and they still insist it isn't.Anyway, looks great, is quiet enough to sleep through, and does a great job of circulating air in both summer and winter. I just bought a second one for our living room, and we're talking about a third for the TV room. With no central AC, the fan will be all we'll need in a Seattle summer."
5,Easy to Use,"I had purchased the HP Ipaq and returned it as it was difficult to read. The Sony is much easier to see and very easy to use. Also, I prefer the Palm Operating System."
1,Surprised,"I purchased a refurbished clie PEG-SJ30 and the keyboard was not working. A month and a half later after different instructions from three different service technicians at SONY, I am still waiting for my Clie to be repaired and returned to me. I would advise you to be cautious before purchasing refurbished products.Scott Erdman"
3,good looking ... but bad quality,"You should assume the battery is the last to give up on a PDA, right? NO! My SJ30 works in just over 1 year, and the battery has some problem. Initially, it seems it can never charged up, always stuck with 70%, then 50%. Well, one day it gives 100% again. So I keep on using it until suddenly it collapse without any warning. Strange thing is, even with power plug in, the Clie can't be turned on! Either the cable connection is not right or the battery has charging problem. However, the light is on showing power IS pluged in!I heard about same bad story about the touch screen on another one year old clie.What the heck is happening to Sony?!"
3,Good game,"good game, but there are to many moving parts. on the level I amon, you are resposible for 3 snipers, and even if you aren't using thatsniper, he can still get killed. It just isn't my type of game."
3,"Fun...At The ""Used"" Price","This game can sedate the bloodlust and battle-envy of most gamers, but only if purchased at the used price. Paying full price, gamers will feel let down with the lack of story, plot, or anything coherent. The gameplay itself is fun, but somewhat a little repetitive. I am not saying this is a bad game, there are just better games in the same genre that are currently on the market."
1,Money Down the Drain,Do not buy this game. From my experience I got stuck on the first sniping level it is impossible! I am a great gamer and have beaten many wargames including all of the call of duty series. This is the worst I have ever played! Do not buy this worthless game!
3,Not what I thought it was,"The Farjeon contribution to this issue of Children's Digest turned out to be the story ""Elsie Piddock Skips in Her Sleep"", a wonderful story, but available in many other more convenient forms. You can see this if you look closely at the cover image. The ""Castle of Doom"" story is not by a Farjeon."
3,Looks good - Doesn't Stop Dogs,I bought this because my dogs were destroying part of my yard. It looks nice and installs easy. The dogs however push right through it like it isn't even there. This will stop low energy dogs. But even my dog that won't push open an unlatched door has no issues walking through this and bending it.
2,Not Worth The Price!,"I was very disappointed in this DVD. Considering the capabilities of the medium (even in 1998), the video is much too short, and contains far too little of the actual game. When I purchased it, I expected the complete game-and got a few highlights and statistics. Do not buy this DVD; the VHS video of the Broncos Super Bowl XXXII victory is far superior-and costs much less. The DVD is a ripoff-period."
3,Good product - not perfect for a3,"Doesn't fit the holders for the floor mats in my 2008 a3; I did go through the fitment app and it said they would fit. Good material - does not feel or look cheap. They are a little slippery under my heels when I am driving, though. I am not disappointed but not thrilled, either (one could only expect to be so thrilled about floor mats, anyway)."
4,Indispensable for addicts,"Penguin's Wodehouse Companion is actually a compilation of two earlier books by Richard Usborne--""Wodehouse at Work to the End"" and ""A Wodehouse Companion."" It combines elements of biography, critical bibliography, and apologia (for the controversial Berlin broadcasts). Brief plot summaries of all 92 novels are included. If you love Wodehouse, but have trouble keeping all the tangled skeins straight, this text will be of immense utility. It could have been improved by an encyclopedic coverage of the characters and key props. Hopefully Penguin will see fit to bring it back into print."
2,Just a compilation,I was awaiting a good compilation of pictures showing the divine name Jehovah on coins.But there is all but uninteresting text. The few pictures at the end of the book are pityfull.
1,"Oil pump problem, Makita DCS 34","Oil pump is plastic junk & requires complete removal of the engine to replace. My pump failed after 8 hours of use.Also the choke control protrudes & catches on clothing & shuts down saw. I have two other, larger Makitachain saws & love them........I think the second team engineers must have designed this one...."
1,Poor excuse for an airconditioner,"Do you have 3 hours to install this lemon? First, take it apart. Then, remove many pieces of styrofoam. Then put it back together (but only after you install the shell in the window. Then, you turn it on. What's this? Just slightly cool air. Well, it must take time to get started. One hour later, ask yourself, what's wrong? Why is it so hot in here? Three hours later, contact the retailer about returning it. No good, you took it apart (which you had to do to install it). Go to the store to buy a fan, thinking that if the air circulated, it would be cooler. No good. Contact Friedrich. No response. Still sweltering, but $400 poorer. Stay away."
1,Disappointing! Models don't work!,"We find Macaulay's books intriguing and so proceeded to order the kit for our 11 year old daughter. She loves science, does experiments on her own at home, elects to attend science camps every summer, and wants to be an engineer. She found the instruction cards attractive and easy to follow BUT ""half the things didn't work"" and ""it was boring"". She was extremely disappointed with the kit as she painstakingly followed instructions, and attempted to troubleshoot and adapt the models when she found they wouldn't work. My husband and I are an electrical engineer and a physician respectively, and we too were unable to shed any light on the problems she was having. We definitely would advise parents NOT to buy this kit."
1,Not Worth the Money!,"It is a decent action game. However, it is not like the previous three games where you have the opportunity to walk around and explore Hogwarts - there is none of that, no interior Hogwarts at all to walk through. You don't really lean any new spells they just occupy one button on your controller. ALso, they totally did away with Fred and George's Joke shop and now you use your beans to gain strength through wizarding cards but the whole thing is just stupid. I, like 20+ others that I know, am completely disappointed and feel that the game, was a waste of money. It was absolutely no fun at all to play. It's just a bunch of tasks outside of Hogwarts - you don't see an interior of the castle at all. Save your money."
1,I felt buried in this boring movie,This movie is terrible. You first of all don't care what happens to the main character as he is not likable at all. He is lazy and does nothing to help his situation except scream in a phone. He apparently can hear people talking and music so he obivously not buried too deeply. Only at the end do they attempt to pull at your heart strings. Don't waste your time you should bury yourself in a coffin and try to get yourself out as this will be more entertaining then this movie could ever be.
1,Terrible,They had to have spent less on this movie than the price of the disc set. Terrible in all regards. Why would anybody make or watch this turd is beyond me.
1,Unbelievably Bad,"Even Reynold's usual quality performance did nothing to help this loser of a movie. I won't add anything that will make this review a spoiler, but will say everything about it is totally unrealistic. A standard, old fashioned Zippo style lighter burns almost constantly through the movie without adding fuel? The cell phone battery which is almost dead from the beginning never dies? He wastes time calling his home to hear his son's recorded voice on voice-mail, instead of seeking help with the phone that supposedly has limited battery life? Ditto a call to his mother who is in a nursing home? People he contacts on the phone are more interested in where he is than in listening to his problem? Those are just of few of many impossible happenings. If you're looking for realism be sure to pass on this bomb. I stuck around to see how it ended, but other than that, a real waste of time. Too bad Ryan is even linked with this movie. He had to have done it just for the money; a real shame."
1,The entire movie is filmed in a box,I like the actor in this movie so we thought we would give it a shot. The entire movie was filmed with him inside of this box trying to get out. It had a few parts that were suspensful but I was not excited about the time I spent watching this low budget movie.
2,Disapointing,My mom and I went to go see buired at the block that was the only movie theater that was playing buired.The end was so depressing that my mom was crying when we got out. The only good part about this movie was seeing really hot Ryan Reynolds.Heads Up Ladies
4,Atmospheric,Considering there is pretty much only one actor this is a good movie. Somemay have trouble with the amount of air in the box and the Zippo that never runs out but if you can suspend your belief this is an entertaining film
2,HITCHCOCK IN A BOX,"I don't see credit given to the true experience of Roy Hallums who, in 2004, while a contractor in Iraq was captured by terrorists and buried alive. His incredible story is worth finding and reading.That said, the movie version of this similar story is a masterpiece of clever filmmaking. Everything takes place inside a coffin-like box. Ryan Reynolds is terrific as the encased victim and director Rodrigo Cortés captures everything with a creative use of unexpected camera angles and masterful lighting, sound design and editing. The move never cuts away to flashbacks or actions above ground. As one might expect, this taut tale is extremely claustrophobic, and utterly terrifying. In many ways, this movie, though confined to a single location, kind of reminded me of an Indiana Jones set piece. But it's really more like a Hitchcock murder mystery about a victim in a box instead of a locked room."
3,buried,"I really like Ryan Reynolds and he was great in this movie. I enjoyed the movie but got a little bored. I wish they had more of a story line outside of the coffin. The whole film is 1 actor, 1 scene. I would have enjoyed the storyline leading up to the moment Ryan Reynolds character was put in the coffin. Overall good but definitely a rental movie rather than a purchase as I can not see myself watching it again."
5,Unnerving,"This movie takes place in a coffin. Know that up front. However, it is absolutely necessary and completely effective. Never before have I had a reaction to a film the way I did to Buried. You are completely and utterly buried along with Reynolds which is what makes the ending so effective. Anything that happens to our protagonist is essentially happening to you. The ending had me gasping for air, uncontrollably shaking and wanting to press play immediately after it was over."
1,Freekin Boring,"I fast forwarded the first three minutes because there was absolutely nothing going on. Just a black screen. I know why. But it was boring. It never recovered. The dude wakes up in the pine box, gets all panicky. I gave it ten minutes. Lame. Never showed any promise so I just turned it off."
1,Would rate it zero stars if possible,"One of the worst movies I have ever seen! Enough positive reviews out there for you to read to balance my negative one.I am warning you though, you may hate it! I am glad I was half sleeping during the movie and didn't have to waste a full 90 minutes of my life watching it."
1,This film should have stayed burried,"I can honestly say this is one of the worst and most disappointing movies that I have ever seen. Reynolds performance and the fact that Amazon wont let me put zero stars are the only things saving this from getting zero stars.Taking place entirely in a box is a bad enough idea, but to add on an ending that makes the viewer think ""Why did I just waste an hour and a half on watching that?"" to a movie that they knowingly took a chance on watching is just a slap in the face.The film is a fantastic example of what not to do. Confusing marketing campaign makes the viewer think they are getting something else, then the film itself takes a primordial crap on the viewer. I knew what I was getting into before I went to see this, I just didn't expect it to be this horrible.1/5, This movie belongs in the bargain bin next to straight to dvd/bluray releases."
1,Troma Team does their worst with this Kevin Costner t**d.,"I thought it wasn't possible but a Troma movie has finally turned my stomach. Horrible acting, boring love interests, not to mention Kevin Costner as a horse trainer. With no identifiable plot and stars changing roles throughout the course of this movie it's virtually impossible to watch. On the plus side this is a Troma movie and it is filled with naked girls for no good reason. Because Of this fact I would highly recommend this to a friend."
5,sizzle beach usa,"about an boogie nights of the early 80's West Coast. when a rancher meets three young sexy girls, he familiarizes them with the hard and fast rules of life."
4,Just Amazing,"This game has the best grafics out of all of the Harry Potter Games, and well all the games I've come across of. It's similar to the computer game and very hard (I'm 16 and bad at video games). Very fun! I hope they make a GBA game for Deathly Hollows.Twilight Sucks.Good Luck finding all of the sheilds!"
2,I hate this game,"I thought this game would be similar to Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban. It's not. I can't even get past the level where they are in the forest. Also, if I try to use a different file, I can't get out of the first level. I don't play it that much and yet I solved Prisoner of Azkaban.I really hate the Auto Save and I hope the next game they come out with is better."
1,I thought it was going to be good...it was horrible!!!!!,"this game is really bad. the whole time, you are trying to blow up things. i got bored after 5 minutes of the game. the yule ball is the only fun part. you may like this game, but i could never recommend it. i liked raven 2 and the incredibles much better."
2,"received a Pleatco, not Unicel","I've always used Unicel filters for my pool and was thrilled to find it thru Amazon.com for $49.78 (pool store charges $66). Took about 9 days to finally receive it only to find out it was a Pleatco. By then my pool was in pretty bad shape so I decided it was probably similiar. Don't be fooled - it's an inferior product. Chlorine kept the water blue but the filter made the water cloudy. Spent $17 on clarifier, no help. Ended up buying a Unicel at the pool store. What a waste of time & money."
5,Excellent cartridge.,"There's no need to buy an expensive brand name filter when you can get this Unicell product. If you put it next to the original one, you won't be able to tell the difference. If you're a pool owner, you're going to buy a lot of filters over time, so buy these filters and save $."
2,Old ideas for a new milennium,"Come on, De Bono! if I hadn't managed to pick this for a couple of dollars in the discount bin I'd go for one star. De Bono says (in his book on wisdom) that the rules for mathematics don't change and so each of his books go over the same ground. But no one would explain the multiplication tables in every single one of their books, would they? If you nothing else from De Bono then maybe this is a good summary. Get 'Serious Creativity' instead though is my suggestion."
5,A. Lincoln and Me,"This is an excellent picture book for young readers. Louis Borden has done a great job with the writing of this book. The book is about a young boy who loves the fact that he shares his birthday with our 16th president, Abraham Lincoln. Throughout the book, the boy also discusses physical attributes that he shares with Lincoln. These attributes consist of large hands, large feet, and a ""bean pole"" stature. Ted Lewin has done a wonderful job with the illustrations of this book. The first time I looked at the pictures, I actually thought they were photographs because they looked so life-like."
4,Rebus resurrected?,"RESURRECTION MEN puts John Rebus in a school for malcontents; policemen who refuse to follow the rules. There they are given an old case to solve, one that will teach them the spirit of teamwork. Of course it's never as straight forward as that as the addition of a murdered art dealer, the old case being something from Rebus's past, and the possibility of some ""bent"" cops, all make the path to resolution twisted and filled with dead ends. Using his wits and a deal with the devil, Rebus is able to make some semblance of this mess, but things may head from bad to worse in the future. Rankin is in fine form on this one, and Rebus remains one of the best characters in crime fiction."
3,In over their heads,"Would you beleive the cast is asking MTV for $4,000 per episode if they bring it back a second season? Thats insane. granted it was one of the hottest shows to hit MTV in ages. Not even some of the worlds top entertainers get paid that much.When i first heard about the show I was sick to my stomach its your typical MTV show, hot girls and guys with more muscles than brains, after seeing some of the cast on every talk show on the planet I was kind of forced into watching it every week. Its an ok show..What i dont like is all the romance between two of the cats members all that love and forgiveness only to find out they hate each other now just kills the DVDUncensored? Folks please understand these reality shows are never uncensored on the DVD's, the only thing uncensored is the language on most."
1,Another dumbed down Reality show for the masses,"It seems that year by year we get more reality shows featuring stupid to be watched by people who will watch anythng.What is next?We now have shows like American Idol, Bachelor, Real World and this to show the public that there are people dumber than themselves."
1,Don't waste your money,"Yeah the DVD does not prove to be uncensored as it is advertised. Jerry Springer was uncensored, Jersey Shore was just put a a DVD. Same stuff you see on TV you'll see on the DVD. If you're like most and want to see some extra stuff on the DVD then don't bother because it's not there. Just wait for the reruns"
1,worst humans ever,"These are extremely ignorant people who really have no place on this planet. They give men, women, Italians, Americans, and mammals a bad name- it's really quite astonishing. I am appalled that they aren't intelligent enough to be appalled."
3,Uncensored....but not really =/,"Okay i really like watching jersey shore and i was really looking forward to watching all of season 1 since i missed a few episodes. I was even more excited since this was the ""uncensored"" version.....Not really.The only thing uncensored about the Jersey Shore DVD is that you can hear all of them swearing now. That's pretty much the only difference i've seen between the DVD and the season on TV. Everything else, nudity for example is still censored. Just letting everyone know."
1,Really?,"I can't believe this is entertainment. Did the stupid in entertainment create someof the problems in society, or did society get stupid and demand this entertainment?"
2,Watched about 5 minutes...,... and that was it. Heard alot about this show but never saw it. Just a bunch of horny rude kids with limited IQ.
4,We all enjoyed it,"Bought this to watch with a few friends, and we all became addicted to the show. By ""uncensored"", it means they don't block out the swears/vulgar words that they do on regular television. If you're expecting porn you will be disappointed. All the episodes are on 3 discs with good picture and sound quality. There's also a bonus disc that includes ""Before the Shore"", the reunion special, Tips from Snooki and The Situation, and deleted scenes. Can't wait for Season 2!"
1,A Total Waste of Time and Money,"""Jersey Shore, Uncensored"" is a reality show which throws together four overly-endowed, slightly overweight, slutty, young women with vocabularies like a boatswain mate; and four narcissistic, muscular, young men; also with boatswain mate vocabularies. They are boarded at a home on the boardwalk at Seaside Heights, New Jersey. The show is hosted by yet another young man whose vocabulary is equally interspersed with off-color words and phrases.I managed to make it through the first three episodes on the first DVD without tossing my cookies. Having been raised on the Jersey shore, the only good thing about the show was the nostalgia when I saw Seaside Heights. The rest....a total waste of time and money."
5,The most valuable item,"This CD was produced with the cleat intention of propaganda against landmines, but the music by Sakamoto Ryuichi is rather lyrical as his music usually is, and the lyric by David Sylvian is simple. This music involves not only Chris Moon and chlidren in Mosanbique, but also many famous pleple such as Dalai Lama and Princess Diana. Since we remember her brave action against landmines, the music blends with beauty and sorrow, as well as anger.This CD also contains different versions of the music. The first title is very dramatic and great, the second is lyrical with Sakamoto's piano accompanying David.The message of the music is challenging, but what impresses on us by its gentleness is human love. I believe this CD has a lasting value for people all over the world."
5,good product,The only drawback to this machine is that it is very heavy--but I knew the weight when I ordered it.
2,overheats,"I've owned this Vacuum for just over a year. Let's be honest, I should be using it more than I do. It is now overheating and shutting off after about 5 minutes of use. I bought it since my last Hoover lasted over 10 years. There are a lot of options out there. Pick a different one. (I gave it 2 stars only because it gave me no fits for the whole year. Loved the retractable cord, the accessibility of the wand and easy to change bags. But none of that matters when it wont stay on.)"
1,"Broke second use, not under warranty","Works great, but broke second time i used it and Hoover will not honor the warranty from amazon."
1,Difficult to handle,"I concur with many other reviewers: this beast is too cumbersome to handle. It has so much suction power in its bulky body that you must constantly wrestle with the machine. On bare floors it blows pet hair all around instead of sucking it up, and the pet hair attachment is ineffective. The bulky base is useless in tight spaces. I love the wand design concept, but the implementation of the design is flawed. So much suction moves through the wand that it is difficult to control and maneuver. I am returning my purchase after 3 weeks of use."
1,Don't buy this vacuum !,"I purchased this vacuum in March, had to receive a replacement in April because the original just stopped working. Now my second one is broken and it's not even 6 months old.The suction was terrible when it did work, the roller stopped working although the belt is still intact. The cord rewind doesn't function properly.I can't think of anything good to say about this vacuum cleaner other than the color is nice."
5,Great fun,"Ordered this set for my bar area. I've owned it for 2 months and it gets used at least every weekend.So far, the board is holding up well, there are dart holes, but true to the description, they appear to heal after use. I could see how heavy users would wear this out fast though. The metal dividers do get in the way sometimes, but I think that's normal.The darts included with this set are average, they do their job but are not amazing by any means. I knew coming in that I'd have to upgrade eventually. For now, they are still kicking and work well (although I did superglue one after it fell and the plastic end split).All in all, I'm very happy with this set I got for about $30. It's perfect for me as a beginner and friends who are intermediate dart players."
1,Rubbish,"I should have read the reviews before buying!!! Where do I start?The good - it looks like a real dartboard.The bad - The darts are such low quality that I guarentee that you will want to replace them immediately. One of the six darts broke within minutes of playing. The dartboard itself looks and feels like a decent board however I have had it for just over two months now and the wire rim is coming out of the board. This started to happen within a couple of weeks but I could just push it back in with staples that attach to the board. However the wire is now bent and won't push back in so the dartboard is useless, cannot be used and is beyond repair. I shall be buying a better board.If you just want a cheap dartboard that you will keep in the basement and use infrequently - don't waste your money on this one. It's not even that good."
5,best multi-tool is this NEW Wave!,"This is simply the best multi-tool: compact, solid, and an excellent selection of rugged tools. Particularly noteworthy: superb knives (straight and serrated), well-made sissors, a bit tool with interchangeable bits - it comes with a phillips head, but you can buy a set of 22 additional bits for just $20. The Swiss Army SwissTool has many enthusiastic users, but I have both and definitely prefer the Leatherman: the SwissTool is pretty, but the New Wave simply has better tools in every case. (No comparison, in particular, for the blades!)Note that the New Wave, unlike the original Wave, DOES have all-locking tools!"
4,Strong,"Several strong and made ''from raw bear the heavy useHas several additional, but are sold individuallyThank you for this product"
5,Leatherman 830040 New Wave Multi-Tool with Nylon Sheath,"Great product. Leatherman is the final word in multi-tool. Buffed mine on an abrasive wheel to break down the sharp edges, and lubricated with WD-40."
5,Favorite tool on earth,"There's not much more to say about the Leatherman New Wave other than what the title of my review suggests. I absolutely love this tool! I do not know how I lived my life for 38 years without one. The amount of jobs and instances that this tool comes in handy is incalculable, that's no exaggeration. I buy Leathermans as gifts for friends and loved ones who have yet seen the light. Okay, I know I'm a bit dramatic but I truly can't express how much I love my Leatherman. This particular model has everything I need to get dozens of tasks done. I also highly recommend the bit set and bit extension piece."
2,leatherman wave,well this is not as good as my wave i got new 10 years ago the blade catches when you open it its really tight and i have been useing it for 3 months and still hasnt gotten better
3,Great Product!,The only negative is that it's to heavy! Good steel and stays sharp for an extended periods! Great Product made in America!!!
4,Fun Read!,"I thoroughly enjoyed the first book in the series. It is a fast-moving, fun and funny book that really keeps things moving along. Occasionally there's a little too much work pulling the plot together, the setup seems rather formulaic (maybe intentionally?), some odds and ends like that, but I highly recommend this to anyone whose a fan of the odd bit of fantasy or sci-fi satire.It feels a bit like if Pratchett did sci-fi with more straightforward plotline, you'd get something like this (that by the way is a compliment!).One thing that sets it apart from some of the other trifles out there is that you really do feel that Hal and Clunk have actually changed and grown by the end ... so many of these types of novels wind up with the characters being exactly the same at the end, and this is really a nice surprise. Something like 'character development' actually making it's way into a fun book like this? Crazy!"
4,This writer should be flogged!,"Just kidding, but the terrible pun involving the robot and the squeegee demands some level of physical abuse.Nice, fun, easy read; thanks! I'll be buying more in the series."
3,I do not like it,"It is neither very exciting nor very funny. It was good enough not to give during a long flight, but never again."
1,Not worth the effort,"Boring, very predictable, poorly written.Let's just say I would highly NOT recommend this book."
5,Outstanding novel.....,"As I sit here, I ponder over all the novels I have read over the years. From mysteries to romance none really stuck out in my mind until I read The Key by Peter Mars. I am not sure if it's because I have had the pleasure of actually meeting Peter and knowing him as a person just like myself, and not knowing he had ever written a novel let alone three. I was amazed when he handed me The Key to read, and I had no idea what it was going to be about or if it was going to be something I would find interesting. On the contrary, it peaked my interest and was very hard to put down. I loved how the ending was unpredictable and exciting. I have passed along the copy I purchased to family and friends recommending that they read the other two novels as well. I found the novel very well written and full of great imaging tools. I look forward to reading any and all future novels by Peter Mars."
2,Bell Gel Relief Seat Cover,"I purchased this product about 2 weeks ago. The first problem that I experienced was that it did not fit my mountain bike's seat. I had to change the seat so that it fits. It did not fit as I thought it would be. When I ride my bike, the front of of the gel cover moves from right to left and vice versa. Also, the gel cover moves forward and backward. What I suggest is, before you purchase this product, make sure that it will fit your seat. Otherwise, you will have wasted your money."
4,good,Comfortable ride but still get sore after awhile on the narrow seat. but all in all its a great product.
2,It's not very good.,It's not very good because it cannot tightly fit on the seat (keep moving. It would be better if using non-flexible texture.
1,Great Seat cover - But....,Great Seat - sadly it did not fit over my spin cycle seat at the gym. I've returned the item and await credit.
5,Get to know the real Dion Fortune!,"Not exactly a biography, this book is a personal quest of discovery that you take part in with the author, who goes directly to the people and places surrounding the life of the elusive Dion Fortune. This book delivers in making the reader feel closer to, and more knowledgeable about Dion Fortune. If you can find a copy make sure you pick it up. It's a fascinating journey that you will not regret."
4,"Encyclopedia of Bidding Tricks, but a bit dated.","This is one of the best books ever written on basic bidding technique. Belying its title, its really about both IMPS and Matchpoint tactics. It is a long book with encyclopedic coverage of bidding. My only reason for not rating it 5-stars, is that it is dated and needs to be up-dated to account for the now standard ( at least among advanced-expert players) Two over one and Precision bidding systems.Most of the book is still applicable to today's systems. It is filled with reliable solid advice that seems to seldom followed by many players. It also includes many over-looked gems like when an opener should support responder's major suit response holding 3 cards.Any player, intermediate or expert could well invest a month to read and re-learn many of the principles and tactics taught in this book.And Kit, if you are listening, please up-date this gem !"
1,Poor Quality,Arrived with the black cats partially scratched off and the glaze was cracked over the entire bowl. The shipping cost more than the bowl.
1,TERRIBLE,"If you are a true Bronte fan. You will not want to watch this movie. I checked it out at my local library expecting something on the lines of Sense and Sensibility and soon discovered that the producers must have lost all sense during the production of this movie. What were they thinking?!! This is not Ann Bronte, it's a producer/director using the name of a book and writing his own story! I couldn't even finish the movie, it was too awful, the flashbacks were bizarre, and finally when it shows her with her ""husband"" ""romancing"" it was too much for this Victorian. After a while you began to count the minutes in between the conversation and people walking around on the screen looking bored! BBC should try reading the books first, that way they can end up with widows, not prostitutes as the heriones of their next movie."
1,disappointing,"I found this movie ""underwhelming"" to say the least. The story was not well developed- it's going in the rummage sale box."
3,"Good product, but sheds a lot of plastic when used.","This was a good product, but sheds a lot of plastic when used. The knob loosens as you are pedaling so you need to constantly be tightening it. It is worth what I paid for it."
1,Worst purchase ever,I purchased this Duo-Med pedal exerciser several weeks ago. The rubber stabilizers are still sitting outside my house. They smell so bad I'm afraid I'll have an asthma attack if I bring them in. Of course the product is unusable without them. I can't believe the Company puts out a product with such a noxious smell. I should have sent it back but threw away all the boxes before I discovered the overpowering smell. I would not suggest that anyone buy this product.
5,Excellent Product,"I purchased this product for my grandmother, as she is in recovery after surgery for a perforated ulcer. Her physician prescribed a program of some low impact exercise and recommended a staionary pedal device. I came onto Amazon's site so that I could research these products and choose the best one. After reading the posted reviews and taking all that was written into consideration, this is the pedal exercise which I chose.The product is sturdy, yet light weight. My grandmother has been able to use it without any problem and she enjoys it. Highly recommended!!!"
4,Great economical pedal exerciser,"This is a decent piece of equipment, especially for the money. Although you do need to sit up higher than you normally would at a desk or chair, it's a nice way to keep moving and burn a few calories while you watch tv or surf the Internet, or as a way to keep active at work. I purchased a second one as a gift for my elderly mom, who needs a simple way to exercise at home. Well worth the price!"
1,[Horrible],THIS GAME HAS A COUPLE OF GOOD WEAPONS BUT ONLY THREE LEVELS!! THAT MAKES IT NOT WORTH 20 CENTS. I BEAT IT THE FIRST NIGHT IN 2 HOURS ON THE HARDEST DIFFICULTY. I TOOK IT BACK TO THE STORE I BOUGHT IT FROM THE NEXT DAY AND GOT 18 WHEELER. CONFIDENTIAL MISSION WAS PROMISSING BUT AFTER THE THRID AND FINAL LEVEL I WAS [mad] THERE WEREN'T ANY MORE LEVELS. IT MIGHT BE 2O BUCKS BUT THREE LEVELS OF SEMI INTENSE ACTION ISN'T WORTH THAT. DO NOT BUY THIS GAME!! YOU WILL BE MAD IF YOU DO
5,All I needed for most telco ISP duties.,"This thing does it all. It's a solid tool that is compartmentalized enough to last. If you work out of the office for an ISP, I don't know how you'd get along without this thing."
4,"Sturdy, a bit heavy","PROSSturdyLeatherman brand gives me confidence it will last yearsMore tools than you can think to useCONSA bit heavy for me -- I think I would have wanted something lighter and more compact. I think the whole thing could be scaled down (lose a few tools) and be as effective. How many types of saws do I need?I'm no McGyver, but some of the tools seem a bit redundant to meThis comes with a nylon sheath--and I prefer the old fashioned leather grain cases that wear with age.A larger pair of scissors would be niceA wrench action would be usefulOpening tools could move more smoothly. I find some pieces to be difficult to pull out-- you have to dig your fingernails in to get a grip and pull with some force.OVERALL: a quality item. Not exactly what I was looking for, but good enough to be reliable on a backpacking trip."
4,Very Nice Leatherman Tool,"Very cool Leatherman tool. I had the original Leatherman Wave for more than two years, and I used it almost every day. It never failed me. My old wave is still in good shape but I decided to get the new one primarily because of the new locking system and the bit drivers. I am happy to report that I have been very pleased with this new Wave. I have not had it long but it not failed me yet. It has a nice black leather sheath and I like the bit drivers, the larger blades, ruler, and the redesign of the scissors. The only thing I would change is the clip point blade; I prefer a drop point. Every one should have and carry a Wave."
5,An essential tool,"I owned the previous Wave for 6 years and used it every day in my work as an auto mechanic. It was tough, durable, convenient, and really useful... Then I lost it one day !!! I was disgusted and immediately set about buying another. I purchased the new wave with the leather sheath. Put simply, it is even better than the original, just as useful, but even tougher and easier to use. I like the bigger easier opening blades, the clever built in tool adaptor, the fact that all the blades and tools now lock, and the revised sheath design. They improved the original without losing it's appeal. I just hope I never lose this one !!"
5,Great multitool,"I have several of these around the house and the cars. I have also given many as gifts. Well made and have enough tools to handle most small repairs. If I had to complain about anything it is that it's a little too heavy to carry comfortably in your pocket all day. No problem if you use the belt sheath though. I also have the Skeletool which is much more pocketable, but also has fewer tools. As other reviewers have said, this also makes a great gift for the handyman/handywoman or outdoorsman. It's a good idea to use a little lubricant to make it operate more smoothly. Also, be careful when opening the blade with one hand. I found out the hard way how sharp it is. If you don't have one of these, you should buy one."
4,Leatherman knows what they're doing,"I have owned a 1st gen Wave for quite awhile, and only recently broke down and got the newer version. I shouldn't have waited. The ""New Wave"" is a splendid tool. Sure, it has the usual deficits, WAY too tight out of the box, the idiotic choice of Tamper Torx fasteners (really, why do I need Torx TX screws on my multitool?, stop saboteurs?) backing the joint fasteners off less than an eighth of a turn makes the tool much more useable and cleanable.I have the all leather sheath, with a riveted belt loop, the only improvement over the original's brown leather sheath.All in all, Steve Leatherman's 'New Wave' is yet another excellent product, with the usual quirks and caveats familiar to Leatherman users the world over. Highly recommended"
5,Nothing like the real thing..,"Letherman is letherman.. no reason to buy something else, and to me - Wave is the real thing.Tx, Michael"
5,a tool with a good feel,i had previously owned a leatherman blast but lost it at a junk yard. the wave is a much nicer tool with a wider range of gadgets. it took losing a knife that i used almost daily and thought i could not replace to find out how much better it is to use the wave tool.
5,Leatherman Wave,"It's got all you need when on the field, but a cork screw.An excellent helplul basic. Just don't forget to put it in your checked in luggage when traveling by airplane."
4,Even though I know how it ends...,"How do you tell that someone has created something extraordinary? When you are transfixed by it even though you know how it ends. T.A. Dodge's history of Hannibal had me hoping that somehow, the brilliant general would pull a victory out at Zama, even though I already knew how it all turned out.Dodge is unabashed and unapologetic in his admiration of Hannibal, and that is okay by me. My only real complaints about the book are (1) that Dodge spends no time laying out the political system of Rome (admittedly, this is not what he set out to do in writing the book, but it would have been helpful in understanding developments) and (2) Dodge includes several quotations from Napoleon and other french commentators in the original French, and the authors have offered no translation.I cannot wait to read other books by this author."
4,Excellent research of field tactics in Ancient Warfare,Author provides exact details in reference to troop movements and tactics from both sides of the 2nd Punic War. References are discussed in detail as well as differences of opinion between historians. Subjects such as which route was taken by Hannibal to cross the Alps or the exact location of the Cannae battlefield are logically worked out for the reader. This is an excellent reference for the 2nd Punic War and the Roman system at that time.
5,Great Movie,Jet Li show his chops being a drama actor in this dvd! Great Job by Jet! He should make more movies like this one.
1,Doesn't work,I got it to work after much struggle the first time I took it out. After that it wouldn't work at all. Nothing happens when I change the lever from the up to down position and it leaks air when I try to use it. I'm late to class today due to a flat tire CAUSED by this pump. DO NOT BUY!
4,An Fun Over the Top Actioner.,"A Sweet Hearted Hit-Man (Mark Wahlberg), who just wants to be a Ordinary Person but When His Double Crossing (Played by Lou Diamond Phillips Way Over the Top Here) kidnapped a Attractive Rich Asian Young Woman (China Chow) with the Help of Two Another Assassins (Bokeem Woodbine, Antonio Sabato Jr.) but as it`s turns out to be Thier Boss Goddaughther (Avery Brooks).Directed by Che-Kirk Wong is acutally Surprisngly Well Made and it`s also Executive Produced by John Woo. Written by Ben Ramsey brings a Stylish High-Energy Action Film with Offbeat Comedy. This was an Modest Success in Theater but Gained a Cult Following in Video. This is a Outrageous Film to be Sure but for Die-Hard Fans of Action Films, will have one Hell of a Time with This Movie. Grade:B+."
3,Pretty good action comedy,"A lot of the action scenes in this movie are incredible. One scene where the movies hero is out running a car that is flipping toward him, despite looking a lot like the train crash scene in The Fugitve, is very good. The comedy is quite funny too. The only real problem I had with this movie was that for a movie with so many laughs, it had a very mean spirited and realistic scene involving the shooting and carjacking of a Good Samaritan. Also I found the hero to be a bit of a wimp and not totally likeable. Other than that it was entertaining."
2,Big flop,"I saw this movie when I was like 11. It was cool then because it was mindless action but, it don't have the same affect on me now. It's super corny"
1,How Fast Can You Break a Leatherman?,"This is a very short review, because well, the tool lasted about five minutes. I took it out of the box and began looking at the various tools. Snap! The locking mechanism just broke right there and then! Are you kidding me? It will be returned for another try, but this is why I have lost faith in these companies. Never had any problems with my Gerber (except, which seems to be the case with many of these tools, the fact that it can be difficult to remove the other tools.)"
4,what a blast,"this was the first time buying something from the USA and on amazon .The leatherman has had a hard few weeks work and it has performed very well ,easy to use lots of bits that do the job .Ill be getting something else soon .And the price was alright aswell.Thanks Amazon."
4,pretty decent knife,This knife has been pretty good. It does the job pretty well. I use to own a swiss army knife and these pocketknife is just as good. Good quality.The sheath is a nag. There are these metal rings that stick out and get in the way when you put the knife into the case. You need to play around to get the knife in there.
5,Truly meets its reputation,This Leatherman tool is fairly lightweight and compact but it sure does meet the reputation of a larger and heavier Leatherman. The quality of this Leatherman is excellent and I believe it will be durable and last for a long time.
4,Very enjoyable,"I tend to base a lot of my purchases on reviews, so I thought I would start adding my own. :) I actually devoured the reveiws of all of Carrie's books, and because of what I read about the first 2, decided not to get them. I did decide to try this one, and I enjoyed it very much. As I read it, loving mysteries, I kept thinking 'she better tell us why this happened or that happened.' Well, she answered all my questions in a reasonable way. It's light-hearted reading about my 2 favorite characters, and so I have to say I was glad I purchased it."
3,It grew on me,"I was looking for something different to watch and saw a couple of actors I liked in this movie but almost everybody gets killed in it. Probably the truth only the Kremlin would know so well. It reminded me of Mission Impossible and I liked the music during the credits. No it isn't the best movie ever made but its a good one for somethimg different. I got on the Internet trying to find that song played during the credits and this outfit is pretty big world wide. I connected with the Russians in this movie. They did not downplay the US's power. That airplane was coming out of the sky either by them or by the US, but I won't spoil the ending for you. Watch it with a good attitude and it might grow on you too!"
4,Good for the price,Good quality aside from the highlighting in the book but as expected with textbooks but the price was too good to pass up!
2,Average run of the mill side scroller,"The only thins that sets X-Men: Wolverine's Rage apart from other side scrollers is the X-Men license itself. Strip away the fact your playing as Wolverine, and you've just got yourself an average run of the mill side scroller with nothing special attached to it. The game's 13 levels are relatively short and not at all too challenging, and the gameplay gets very repetitive after a while as well. The graphics are nicely animated, but the characters move around a bit jerky, plus it would have been nice to have some added super villians other than Cyber, Sabretooth, and Lady Deathstrike. All in all, if your an X-Men fan and own a GBC, give this game a try, but all others should leave this on the shelf."
1,the worst,"I don't know what these people are thinking.If they want to make a good game so a lot of people will buy it, they have to be using different systems!This game dos'nt look good when you're playing it.these graphics are a joke.And all the old X-men costumes!I being a huge X-men fan was throughly dissapointed.SAVE YOUR MONEY!!!!!"
1,terrible,"this is a terrible cd, i think i counted 2 good songs. these guys totally lost it after ocean avenue, actually, they weren't that good before ocean avenue, well i guess every band deserves 1 good cd."
5,Turn it up! my ears are barely even bleeding!,THIS CD ROCKS!!! Its perfect for cranking up! the drums are fast and the guitars and bass are awesome and theres even some sweet violin in there! and of course the singer is great! This cd is really upbeat and I think its yellowcards best cd! GET IT!
5,Work of art,"The characters seem so real,..you will laugh, def cry , a lot of drama,.. the characters come to life and you will swear it wasnt something you read but stories friends told you,...hard to put the book down and say goodbye to these new found friends,...buy it !"
5,Great Product!,"I ordered this 12 volt regulator 3 days ago and it arrived today. I was surprised it came quicker than other products I order here. The product is exactly what is depicted in the photo. It also was neatly packaged. All in all this was a great purchase, great service, and I will probably make more orders in the future with this seller."
3,It's Cool....for about an hour,"We bought this mold to make beautiful wedding table centerpieces. So, unfortunately our use gave it a lower score. If you had this out for a dinner party, it might be more of a better situation. The ice melts really fast.....about 3-4 hours. It's difficult to put things into the ice like, lemon peel, pearls, and things they show on the picture because when it melts, your items start popping out and it just starts to look sad. Definitely need to use distilled water instead of tap water so the ice is clear and pretty. Otherwise, it's really difficult to see through it which loses it's WOW factor.We became concerned after we had used it a couple times because the plastic within started to bubble. NOT A GOOD SIGN. I liked the holder and believe this product to be unique. The price isn't too bad for what you get."
5,Hard to find,This leather man is not made anymore. I was so amazed to have found it. It made my boyfriend very happy that I just found it.
5,Oooo! Ahh!,"A neighbor's son is a US Marine and requested a Leatherman for his upcoming second tour in Iraq. He stipulated it should be inexpensive as well. I ordered two Fuses, one for him and one for me, on the reccommendation of a previous review by a US Army sargeant.I can understand why these tools are so beloved. I've only had this little device for a few days but I REALLY like it. It folds to a compact size, is reasonably durable, and has a huge number of tools contained within its frame. Its essentially a tool box on my belt. It has a place with my wallet, eye glasses, and keys.#1 upside: I have large hands and the handle is just right for me. The grips are perfect as well, non slip without being sticky. Definitely engineered in America for Americans.#1 downside: Sometimes you need to manuever around the wire cutters in the jaws of the pliers to grip a bolt. To me, it was a bit tricky at first, but that should be the worst thing about this fantastic little device."

3,Magellan Explorist 500,"Like many others, I find the manual instructions are useless. Positive comments: I like the saved route function that can be played back for review in color code for the different travelling speeds. Or maybe I'm impressed easily. NEGATIVE COMMENT: waterproof NOT! Already had to replace the battery due to the cover does not remain sealed. I suspect the lid is not stiff enough to retain its shape. You can press the lid down when the one and only screw is tightly secured. Not good. There may be other damages...not sure. The company apparently does not to provide any updates or patches to allow using the new vista computers or linux operating systems. It would be nice if file names could be set through the computer and sequencially named."
3,Oh dear...,"You know, for being a middle-aged man (I have actually met and interacted with the author...he lives in my neck of the woods now, and he substituted for one of my classes for three days before Christmas 2003), Curt writes more like a teenager or a Tween; his ideas are sharp, and usually well-thought out, but he bounces thoughts and POVs a lot, so the storyline isn't very smooth. TTT drags on frequently, and the entire book focuses on preparation for the Final Event -- only to have the action be scantly described and quite underwhelming. I realize this is Curt's first time writing, but even the Left Behind series (with immense dragging of its own) was more spellbinding than TTT.Maybe -- instead of him helping me write my research paper for World Lit. -- I should have helped him write his book!"
4,Good book for young siblings to be,This helped my oldest daughter prepare for the new baby. She was feelling kind of jealous and I think this helped.
4,"A lot of info, maybe not all useful","This is a good book. It contains a lot of information, although not all of it is useful. This is a great book for someone just getting into four wheeling.My personal thoughts are that this book should have been Jeep or LandRover specific (Those are the authors obvious favorites) instead of trying to be all encompassing of 4x4's. Basically, there was not enought specific information on any type of area or vehicle, and not enough gereral information. The author seemed stuck somewhere inbetween, making this book not really good for either use.I did read the book cover to cover, so I guess it couldnt have been that bad either. I gave it four stars because it did have some info and was a pleasant book to read."
4,good,Book is not bad. But Pathology BRS A.Schneider is better. There are images which could be found usefull. Some information really short and breif description of pathomorphology. Also CD with 350 questions which I found good.
2,These strings broke to easily,"Sounded nice, but quite a few snapped on me. Don't last as long as some other brands I have used."
2,Product is not as advertised,The cable is advertised on this site as 316 alloy stainless. The spool I received was strongly attracted to a magnet. 316 is a non-magnetic alloy. I went to the manufacturers website (Campbell Cable) and the product is actually 304 stainless.304 is less corrosion resistant in a salt water enviornment than 316.
4,Mesh Gloves,"I found theses gloves to be very comfortable. They fit nicely into my oxygen bag as well. I have very small hands and was concerned about how they would fit, but they were a perfect fit. I would recommend them to anyone who wants a nice small wheelchair glove."
5,keeping it suspenseful,"the story progresses like the first book. You wonder if prot is just part of of robin's repressed mind, or a real alien who has taken possession of him.prot reminds me of Mork from Ork. he is a bit arrogant and lacks tact yet says things that really ring true, especially when he's giving his opinion on the human race.i was late getting back from breaks at work because of this book -so beware. i can't wait for the last book in the trilogy to arrive in the mail."
4,Gimme Some Strange,"An excellent follow up to this band's stellar debut. Is it everything you would hope for in a sophmore release? You bet! The catchy hooks and sing-along choruses are all present and accounted for. If you liked the first one, you're gonna drool over this release as well. ""The Island Song"" is worth the price of admission alone. Thumbs up! I wish these guys would get back together and put out another release. Gimme some strange I say...."
3,Hard for me to relate to,"Sue Monk Kidd writes of a darkness in her spiritual life which came upon her during middle age. Not having gone through a similar experience, I had a hard time relating to this book. I can only imagine that this would be a valuable tool for someone going through a dark time in their own lives. Her suggestions about waiting for the Lord and resting in Him are valuable for all Christians and her point is well made that we try to make things happen according to our own agenda, instead of joining God in his almighty purpose. This point is also made (more convincingly to me) in the book, ""Experiencing God"" by Henry Blackaby."
5,A comforting friend for midlife upheaval of the soul.,"Anyone who is beginning to awaken to the passage of time, in particular, one's own life, will find a kindred spirit among the pages of this book. It's a wonderful companion for quiet musings, meditation or prayer. Sue Monk Kidd's sensitive detail and vivid recounting of her own dilemma's make this book a must read for any woman encountering the huge questions of life. Why am I here? What is my purpose? Who am I after all the hats are off"
5,"It's a tow strap, pretty basic","Not much too it; just a strap with 2 hooks. 10,000 lbs is more than strong enough to extract any vehicle (on a mostly level surface) and smaller and mid-sized cars out of ditches, etc.Go with a 20,000 lb strap for SUV's and trucks.Go with a 30,000 lb strap for stumps!"
3,GojuRyu Karate Do Kyohan - You need your reading glasses for this one!,"This text is full of information. It relies heavily on graphics to convey the various movements that form the essential Kata and fighting application of the Goju Ryu style.This is a work that will benefit those of you who have been training for a few years as it requires a knowledge of several higher Kata and a more than basic understanding of goju ryu techniques. It is always good to read the wisdom of a master of our style and Yamaguchi does have some important messages for the thoughtful student of Karate. However, you will have to work your way through short paragraph after paragraph of ideas to find a thought that will grab your attention!Unfortuneately the print and graphic images in this edition are too small for old eyes and if you are over 50 you really need some magnification to be able to read the text and interpret the graphics."
1,Panasonic KX-TGA101S,"Poor sound quality. I have 4 phones and except for the phone on the main base the others work sometimes, but most of the time say the phone is too far from base even when it is only 15 feet away. By listening to Consumer Reports Magazine I bought this phone, but now which I hadn't. Volume issues are also a problem."
4,Panasonic Dect 6.0 Series Cordless Phone System with Answering,"Good System . The answer audio leaves a little to be desired, thus the 4 stars. I originally bought the two pieces but needed the three . Works well."
2,Doesn't hold a charge costs nearly what new 2 set costs,I have this now as the remote to the base station. It's started to not hold a charge. I figured the rechargeable batteries were weak. Replaced them for $6 but the problem persists. But since the replacement cost of JUST this remote station is nearly the cost of a new 2 set I'll spend a few dollars more and get a brand new 2 set with new base and answering machine etc. In fact all I think I need is the base w/o the handset so this price is completely out of whack
2,Phones only recharge from one base,"I have had this phone for a couple of months. I assumed that each handset would recharge from a base, but they only recharge on the control or main base. I have to remember to switch out phones from one base to the next daily or they run out of battery.I also find that the controls from erasing messages, etc aren't user friendly. I would never purchase this phone again."
5,Added more Handsets. Great product.,I've had one of these systems for a couple of years. It worked so well that when I needed more extensions I just got more handsets. They connected in very easily. I was able to use them in less than a minute.
5,Panasonic Handset,I love this Panasonic phone. I have purchased four extra handsets and every each one was easy to install. The price is very reasonable and delivery was quick.
5,A motivational guide to chartering one's own path,"Relentless Love: The Power of a Transformative Life embraces love as the one true religion and spiritual path. Stressing the power of love as that which makes life worth living, it offers means to reclaim the ancient power of love to revitalize one's life, rather than rely on ""feel-good therapies"" and ""soft-core spiritualites"". Chapters stress the process of ""evolutionary elaring"" which involves embracing new ideas without being dependent on an individual or teacher as the sole repository of the wisdom for which one seeks. A motivational guide to chartering one's own path through the physical world and the realm of the soul, a path guided most profoundly by the divine principle of love."
2,"Sadly, it will probably do well","Positive: Beautiful photography (for the most part, when they weren't completely obvious shots).Downsides:1) In an article about women surfers, the author had to comment that ""If you think these are a bunch of tree-hugging, pot-smoking, radicals, think again"". Surfers have been out of the fringe for some time now. Helloooo!!!2) There is and article about an admiral becoming the ""terror of the Yankees"". I thought my grandparents in Alabama were done talking about the damn yankees and how the south lost the war in the 60s but apparently the debate continues...3)Write about a 20th century author BESIDES Ernest Hemingway--someone that might challenge readers viewpoints.Final Note: If southern advertisers are looking for a place to advertise to upper-middle class and above--they've got it. As for a real thoughtful, mind-changing, South meets the 21st Century magazine? Forget it. Verbose does not equal quality or literary."
4,Kindle,My wife enjoys this magazine whenever she can come across it in a medical office or at our veterinarian's office. Wish it came as a subscription for Kindle and Nook.
4,Guilty Pleasure,"I LOVE this publication. It is one of very few entertaining magazines which both the hubby and I can enjoy!Warning, it is only published every 2 months. I purchased the subscription in December and 4 months later, the April/May issue was the first to arrive."
4,An excellent resource!,"This is a fantastic resource for use with children. This resource helps children learn realities about life during bible times. It also has a wide variety of activities, not just the same activity done different ways. The activities take some time and may be a little messy but they are excellent for involvement and for learning."
2,Read this before you buy and suffer.,"I purchased the Nino 510 a week ago, I was happy with the design and the good collection of software, but I had a time from hell trying to connect it to my Toshiba laptop, and as would you expect...the customer support kept telling me that the problem is with the IRQ's of my laptop, and to make the story short I wasted a lot of time and apparently I didn't do a good research before buying the nino."
4,GREAT KNIFE...BUT,I BOUGHT TWO OF THESE KNIVES (ONE FOR A GIFT AND ONE FOR MYSELF). I THINK THIS IS A GREAT KNIFE FOR ALL PURPOSE USE AND ALSO AS ITS INTENDED PURPOSE OF BEING A NECK KNIFE. ONLY DOWNSIDE IS GETTING IT OUT OF THE PLASTIC SHEATH. IT TAKES SOME GETTING USE TO AND IS DIFFICLT AT FIRST TO PULL OUT OF THE SHEATH. YOU CAN CUT YOURSELF IF YOU ARE NOT CAREFUL. NOT INTENDED FOR CHILDREN THAT ARE UNSUPERVISED. BUT OVERALL IT IS A GREAT KNIFE. I ORDERED THEM THRU AMAZON AND GOT THEM WITHIN A FEW DAYS.
1,RCA = Worst Ever,"I have purchased two of these remotes at different times to use on the Sony tv in my bedroom which I use maybe three hours a night. The first remote kept having to have the code put in every three days or so. I thought it was the batteries so I changed them and reprogrammed the remote. Still, it kept needing reprogamming every few days. I thought that perhaps I had purchased a defective remote so I bought another one. I had the same trouble with it. I will NEVER purchase another RCA remote from anyone."
1,Huh?,"This could have been a very tense, psychological study about why an outwardly handsome, well built adult male, who owns a home near a lake and dosen't seem to have a job, but must have money to live on would kidnap a 12 year old girl? He seemed to be obsessed with witches, I don't know if it was a metaphor for a woman's power over men in general or him in particular. The young girl seemed almost comfortable with him, like a perverted father/daughter relationship. However, something about her story just didn't ring true to my ears. Anyway, this could have been a lot better given the material the writers had to work with."
1,$450 of junk,"After three months of using this unit my frustration has caused me to buy another unit. Very little about this unit is functional or intuative. Downloading maps from a computer has resulted in the unit permenantly freezing up. The temp gauge is totally inaccurate, the altitude is rarely correct and the unit takes up to 15 minutes to lock in on the satellites. I have kept the unit and will carry it with me in case I encounter a bear....in which case I will throw it at him, with little regret of lossing something valuable."
3,After sales service,"Although I am happy with the product, I have send several emails to Magellan seeking assistance, but none have been replied too. This may be because I am from Australia, which if that is a problem I should not deal with overseas companies like Amazon.Regards Neville Prosser"
1,No support!,I paid 300+ dollars for a NEW Magellan GPS less than a yearand a half ago from boat Us and they have already declared it obsolete. If you expect any support DO NOT BUY Magellan.
3,Great architect but the book could use some work,"Cardwell does a good job discussing Maybeck's life and work and his effect on Bay Area architecture. Unfortunately, the pictures are black and white and they lack the punch that other Maybeck books have because of that. If you're interested in Maybeck however, it might be worth reading what Cardwell has to say about him given his close, personal relationship with him."
5,Perfect Dark Latin Music CD,"If you like dark-romantic tones, with a hoarse but melodic voice... You will love this CD. Filled with clever lyrics as well as with clever musical arrangements, Rosco brings a mix of latin pop-cuban rhythms-subtle but deep emotional lyrics-and romantic vocals, and makes this cd very tasterful (which is to say the least). Even in the more up-beat songs like Dejaré, Me Calienta, El pegaito, Cosas de La Mujer and No quiero Vivir Sin Ti, you can still feel the dark latin grooves that makes this cd the masterpiece that it is. Buy it, enjoy it and try to prove me wrong. This cd deserves more recognition and deserves to be on your music collection."
4,Little Mac,"A very good book, which shows McCellan for what he was. McClellan was a great general but one that should have worked under someone who could actually lead and army into battle. If his ego would not have been in his way he would have been a good General under someone else. Even Scott could have taught him a few things. Its a must have for anyone interested in the early years of the Civil War."
3,"Slick,vacuous yuppiefunk.","This stuff is pretty antiseptic compared to fresh,funky,slightly edgy stuff,like Philippe Saisse,Yellowjackets,and some of Joe Sample's work.I think Kenny G and The Rippingtons(who have some good stuff)brought ""Jazz"" to the Yuppie generation in a nice,shiny package,and then clean forgot about content."
5,keep it coming,"i have throughly enjoyed this cd up and down and left to right....my favortie track thus far is ""UPTOWN RENDAVOUS""....nice work Gregg!"
4,plasma physics,This book covers a wide range of topics in plasma physics; this book would be great for review or quick study. Knowledge of advanced mathematics is required to understand the formulas because many of the equations are Partial differential equations.
1,what can I say?,I first read this book years ago when it first came out and thought it was so great but after years of mental maturing and becoming more conservative in my thinking and knowledge I find her beliefs and her ideas scary. Not worth the one cent I paid for this copy.
1,not what i thought,awful movie there was no story and just all porn. was looking for indie films and was dissappointed by this!
2,Outdated information,Noninformative. Outdated information. But to get general understanding - quite good. Simple English easy to read.
2,no help to me,I was hoping for an easy way to lay out a pattern and not get lost. This was way too complcated and time consuming. If I had nothing else to do in my life I might could read this and figure out what he was trying to tell me.
1,Negative stars,"This book reads like it was written by a rapist who engages in domestic violence. The ""hero"" rapes and beats the heroine, who is a minor, and then tells her she deserves it. It was at that point that I threw the book into the recycle bin.It's hard to believe that this was written by a woman. I would have said the author was a man with serious problems."
1,Me too...,"This is the first time I've ever given a bad review for a book - this deserves it. I read some of Karen Robards other books and LOVED them, but was absolutely horrified by this book. Not only does the hero rape the girl early in the book as described by other reviews, he rapes her much later in the book when they have been married for some time, and she doesn't even have any desire to leave him! Hardly even cares, though the author CERTAINLY wrote the scene so there was no doubt it was out-and-out rape. Oh well, Karen Robards other books are good romances, but stay far from this one, it is a traumatic read!"
3,"I enjoyed this book, but with some reservations",This book plot was very good. My enjoyment of this book was lessen by the violence. I think the story would have been more romantic if the male character had seduced the lady instead of using force. I couldn't really like this man and he wasn't my idea of a man that would want to sweep me off my feet.
5,Simple yoga for kids,"My fault I didn't realize it wasn't a board book (I'm using it with a group of babies), but even one year olds get the concept as I read it to them, and they try to imitate my movements through the book. Even though they can't look at it themselves, I'm still glad I got it!"
3,Not as good as the previous release.,This cd seems to be a backwards step for the band. The Cd is good nonetheless.
1,Poor Quality Control,"I bought the Milwaukee 6153-40 specifically for metal work. It stopped working after the second use 40 days after I purchased it. The motor was powerful just as I expected. The motor ran, but the grinding wheel became useless since the worm gear became loose inside the tool. I have since had to have it repaired under the warranty. I cannot give it a high rating due to the poor assembly of the tool in Mexico! Beware. Try it out before the 30 day period for return expires at Amazon. A big disappointment when I really needed it. Jerry in AZ."
5,TWO WORDS: BUY IT!!!!,"WITHOUT A DOUBT-- THE BEST, MOST POWERFUL 4 1/2"" GRINDER I'VE EVER USED. TAKES DOWN WELDS IN A FRACTION OF THE TIME OF IT'S COMPETITORS EFFORTLESSLY. GREAT JOB MILWAUKEE!!"
5,Such a cute book!,I love the cardboard and heavy duty feeling of this book. It is a fantastic and fun children's book and I know I will have plenty of hours of enjoyment reading this to my little girl. It's smaller than I expected but that's fine. I love it!
5,"Good, simple fun.","This book is an easy read with expressive pictures. Pete's father plays a game with him to cheer him up and his mother soon joins in. It is a sweet family moment, where the family uses lots of imagination. At first, I didn't see the charm in this book. But my three year old twins liked it. They started requesting it more and more often. And I enjoyed reading it each time. It is a ""feel good"" book. (And, for me, the price of the book is worth just hearing my toddlers say ""Pete's a Pizza!"") Since my children are so delighted with Pete being made into a pizza, and then seeing the ""pizza"" run away, I think I will have to try making them into a pizza soon."
1,curious,"im thinking of buying this product but i would like to know if it is good, if you have this movie could you please tell me weather it is fairly simple to understand or if it is very extensive and long to learn?im simply curious as to weather i will have to prepair for something hard and need to concentrate for or if i can do it in my spare time?thanks"
3,Dynamic range in the sound,The CD was okay but the violin was drowned out by the playing of the Symphony Orchestrathat overpowered the playing of Mr. Bell.
5,Gorgeous,"I've never really thought much of the Tchaikovsky Concerto until I heard Joshua Bell play it. He performed it with the Colorado Symphony about a week before the release of this CD, and I was completely blown away with his performance. Anyone who has seen him perform knows that the image, and his visual performance are almost as good as what you hear. I was then intimidated to get an ""audio only"" version of the piece for fear of losing the vision of the concert, but the CD alone is absolutely incredible, and needs no visual aid. The lighter and more delicate interpretation of Tchaikovsky is rare, and is pulled off so gracefully by Mr. Bell. Extremely challenging technical passages coupled with the fluency and grace of Tchaikovsky make this piece, and especially this interpretation, unforgettable."
1,weak,This album is horrible.Let me start out by saying I have been a siccmade and blackmarket fan since I was 12 now im 28.I first bought this album in high school and was expecting hardcore sac town flows.The beats are boring and the flows are the same thing over and over again.It is hard to even stay focused on the music because his verses are not captivating.I like cos on many songs including zaggs life.This album was a huge letdown for me and started the downfall of siccmade.The first couple of songs are pretty tight the rest are lame.
5,Movie Material,"""Nothing is what it seems, take nothing for granted."" With these words still haunting me from the back of the book, I dove into Mariard, Volume I, The Gifting and couldn't put it down! Ms. Jones leads the reader through an engaging tale, a story of good versus evil, treachery, honor and love that spans a generation.The gift of the Mariard holds unspeakable power. In this novel, opposing factions clash again and again as they seek to win the day, battling not only with their bodies, but with their minds, as well. The ""game"" rages on multiple levels and the reader is swept along in a torrent of magical confrontations until the true natures of Tegan, Cathmore and Vieanne are revealed.What a great movie this would make! The visual imagery contained in the book would yield some stunning sets and the story would capture the audience's attention from the opening to closing credits. I'm really looking forward to reading the additional volumes in this series."
1,y did u have to desapoint us????,"sorry but this iz not wirth it!!! get some lyrics, beats r'nt that good either"
4,Men's Work - a worthwhile read,"This book is well worth reading, especially for men who want to understand and do something about gender based violence. It is accessible and addresses the issues in a down to earth way providing insights significant for both men and women. Suitable for high school age through adult."
5,Best Little Bible Book for little kids,This book is one of the best Bible books we have. I read a story every night to my son (4) and he loves it. The interactive little questions and prayer time is great. He loves it!!! It highlights some great main stories from the bible and teaches them a little lesson with it. It's a must have for kids this age!!!!!!!!!!
2,Waste of time,"I was excited about reading this book because the cover and table of contents looked so interesting. However, upon reading it, I'm not sure exactly what it was about. It was boring, disorganized, and the author's overwhelming sense of snobbery was quite a turnoff! (Not to mention the blurbs on nearly every page singing her praises. Weird.) If you can check it our from the library, it's a quick read, but don't waste your money."
4,I like it,"This is just as pictured. It doesn't provide as much light as I was hoping for, but the night shade is large and noticeable, and it looks good in my newly updated green motif guest bathroom."
5,An exquisite book.,"This was the first bookby Poppy Z. Brite that i read, and i must say it is my favourite. It has brilliant characters, and gives a superb insight into the warped mind of a serial killer. Anyone who viewed serial killers as mere monsters will change their mind after reading this. And the ending is sensational."
2,Hedonistic Murder,"Gory, chilling, shocking. A story about serial murderers who prey on the gay community of New Orleans and London. Violence isn't the only danger here, there is an underlying threat of a virus amongst the characters."
1,Avoid this one at all costs,"What is with Poppy Z. Brite? I read ""Lost Souls"" years ago and loved it... it's joined my shelf my very favorites. However, it seems that Brite is on a downward spiral. Where ""Lost Souls"" was origional, quirky, and eerie, this book is just gross. Do we really need detailed descriptions of a child being tortured? Book after book, Brite continues to obsess over gay men (always disfuntional ones, of course) and either leave women out completely or cast them in the most degrading roles. Perhaps she should just give us the pretense of being a real writer and switch to writing gay porn."
1,the lowest lows,"Having read and loved Brite's other novels, I was grossly disappointed by Exquisite Corpse. And no, it was not the cannibalism or the wonderfully detailed scenes of violence--I actually have a very strong stomach. What bothered me was the the way AIDS was handled in the story, the way it turned its victims into monsters. Usually so loving in her portrayal of homosexuals, Brite stepped over the offensive edge in this case."
2,A serious disappointment,"This book is vivid and incredibly descriptive. For an author that constantly refers herself to be a gay man, she certainly had no problem jumping on the stereotypical homosexual band wagon for this novel. Not only that, but every character is miserable, psychotic, and appears to be almost craving their own demise. The thing I love most about Brite's books is that by the time you get to the end of one, you feel like the characters are old friends. This one fits nowhere near that category. It seemed not only forced, but tastelessly graphic for the sake of pure shock value in most places."
2,An unworthy subject,"Brite writes beautifully. That said, the subject of this book is so ugly and depraved and its characters so loathsome, that I honestly can't see any reason for anyone to read this.I honestly have no issue with authors sexualizing violence to a degree, as this is part of the human experience for some people. But this book is just a bridge too far. If you are interested in grotesque violence as pornography, then this is your book. But my opinion is that the world can be an ugly and depraved enough place without literature that lovingly festishizes these elements. It's one thing to describe and try to understand the horrors of the human experience, but it's a whole other thing to hold them up and pay homage to them."
2,wow how shocking(!),"ho hum, yes Brite's book is very nasty. oh look! somebody's easting human flesh, how shocking(!). basically this book is not all that bad, gross yet nastily compelling. what spoils it is the fact you can almost hear Brite going 'wow how controversial and extreme i am'. she writes like a little girl trying to shock, full of cliches and cod-mysticism. readable, but you'd only ever want to read it once."
5,I was expecting gore and over-the-top torture,"I was not expecting to have my heart broken. PZB's characters are so multifaceted that their pain and loss felt like watching a close friend suffer these horrors.On a more fun side, it was pretty nifty reading her descriptions of food. Makes me wonder why some people were surprised by her so-called 'genre shift.'"
3,"Needed more character depth, less gore","If you have not read Poppy before, do not read this novel first. Even if you have read her, and loved her, proceed with extreme caution. This is not a novel for the faint of heart, or weakly stomached.That being said, I was intrigued by the story, and impressed at the loving detail paid to our culture's last taboos. Ms. Brite's prose is spectacular and tangible; her images so provacative that I caught myself looking away from the page with a wince more than once.Compared to Lost Souls and Drawing Blood (I haven't yet read wormwood), however, I found the character development less complete for Jay and Andrew than it could have been. I do not expect to feel compassion for them, at least not exactly, but they seemed a little hollow. Conversely, I thought that Tran and Luke in particular were exceptional.Overall, Exquisite Corpse was worth the read, and worth owning. Besides, I'm not really sure I could handle understanding a serial necropheliac anyway."
5,Lots of energy,"I take one of these and one of the grapefruit Mega T pills each day I need to accomplish work, and have for years. When overweight, I did lose weight. That is no longer my goal, and I'm no longer losing. The supplements give me lots of physical energy and prevent me from craving fat and sweets. I feel positive and confident when I use them.It is important to drink lots of water, as the green tea has caffeine. I have once taken two each with meals and became panicky and paranoid. I'll never do that again!I don't like taking just the green tea or just the grapefruit pills. Without both, I feel slightly edgy and nit-picky."
5,"Cute movie, great for the entire family, (If you have a nice family)","Cute movie, great for the entire family, (If you have a nice family)The Water Horse - Legend of the Deep (Two-Disc Special Edition)"
4,The Water Horse...,A wonderful family drama. It's mostly drama and storytelling. There is little action but it is still a good movie. I like that it is a safe movie for the whole family to enjoy TOGETHER.
4,water hourse,My 5yr old grandson enjoyed this movie. He watched the entire movie alone and understood it.
1,toy not included,I payed more for this movie to get the toy. I tried to order it twice both times is came without the toy. I was very disappoint. Since I bought this one (twice) trying to get the Crusoe Plush toy.
4,powerful,"I heard about this boat. It has two motors that make it go 10ft a second Don't think I'm a little kid, because I'mm almost twelve. Anyways, It goes 600ft. in a minute. So remember, I'm not five, I'm 11 OK!!!!!!!!!!!"
3,"Nice, but over the top!","Gayle Lynds definintely has some talent, but as an avid thriller reader, I found her plot and characters too unbelievable--in fact I felt as though I were reading a cheesy romance writer's attempt at murder and mystery. Everything was just toooooo contrived, from the CIA head, to the Carnivore, to the look-alike cousins, to the clown disguises, to the evil doctor. For me, this was not a ""page-turner"" and I only finished it because it was loaned to me by my best friend and I had to find out how Lynds wrapped this all together in the final outcome. Unfortunately, the ending was also lame. I believe Gayle will get better with practice and I would recommend this as a good airplane or waiting room read if you want something glitzy that doesn't take much power of concentration."
3,Mediocre spy/romance novel,"I had trouble getting through this book. I was hoping for a spy thriller to keep me on the edge of my seat, but it didn't keep me there for long. Part of the time I was rolling my eyes at the ridiculous plot, and part of the time I was cringing at passages that read like a trashy romance novel. I am really surprised by the large number of glowing reviews. It isn't the worst book I've ever read - there is a lot of action, and the plot keeps moving forward while becoming more and more ridiculous. For me, the plot was unbelievable, the characters were stereotypes, and the writing was mediocre."
2,Completely Unrealistic Plot,"In my opinion, a good spy thriller has to be believeable in order to be truly enjoyable. This is one of those books where you have to completely suspend disbelief in order to enjoy it. This is probably Lynds' intention -- pure escapist entertainment -- but it just didn't work for me at all, due to the rather fantastical nature of the plot.I also found that many of the characters in this book were two-dimensional, more like cartoons than real people. In the end, I didn't find myself caring about any of the main characters.I suspect your enjoyment of this book will depend on your literary tastes. If you like the work of Robert Ludlum, Iris Johansen and David Baldacci, then you may want to give this book a try. If you prefer John Le Carre, Daniel Silva and Michael Connelly, then I would definitely skip this one."
5,excellent product,This CD was in mint condition when it arrived. I was very happy with the purchase.
3,The end of the wicket Shhh..,"I really don't know if the last track Redemption is how he feels or not. If he chooses not to be wicket anymore, well thats cool...but at what price? I honestly feel like esham is in a rock and a hard place, now that he is with psychopathic. That was SOOO much of an ICP song, that is was ridiculous. Losing My Religion from his Judgement Day Vol 1 CD, and Sell Me Your Soul from Vol 2 was better explanations on how he feels about god and religion, and oddly enough, was not on this mix CD. It just sells the fans short when you're not being comprehensive with the song selection. This is ESHAM, not some run of the mill rapper. I will be buying his new one when it comes out, but i just hope that ICP will not be all on it like this one."
5,so happy!,"Very difficult ordering this as I knew it was not 'real'.My 'real' deal was a vintage setting that could not be fixed,nor the stone replaced without purchasing a new setting, whichcan not be afforded at the time. This ring has gone beyondmy expectations, and lasted! I love the true vintage quality of this ringso much, if I ever do return to the position of purchasing a new 'real' ring. . .I would show them this one. No one can tell the difference, especially if you havea wedding band that accentuates the vintage quality.This ring is a gem to find!Thank you Seller!"
1,Useless,"I have read a lot of texbooks over my college career and this book is the absolute worst. It's confusing, poorly organized, and just plain dull. Sometimes I would read the chapters and start to do the review questions and wonder if I was doing the questions for the wrong chapter! The answers to the questions would be in a completely different chapter or just not in the book at all! How anyone could possibly expected to get anything out of this book is beyond me."
1,Confusing Content,"This book is not well organized, the content is confusing and messed up, for a student the book talked too much on virtual and vague concept with out well explained , on the other hand the verbose description some times make you thinking, : "" WHAT ARE YOU TALKING ABOUT?"""
3,"Cardboard box, not good for a gift","The Gator Grip would be a good stocking stuffer, but it comes as a bare part without the retail packaging that is pictured in the Amazon listing.Past that, it is a pretty good substitute for a complete socket set."
3,It is better than some of the cheap chinese models out there...,"I bought mine as a replacement for my Sideclip (thought it was lost, found it!) and it does a fine job of giving you a helping hand; however I still favor my Sideclip. This would be an excellent replacement if Leatherman included the pocket clip; I purchased that separately much to my dismay. I will keep it in one toolbox but continue to carry my trusty Sideclip."
2,A great bar....until it broke!,"I bought this bar in a set of three, 12, 24 and 36 inch. They are great bars, well-shaped and perfectly curved for prying. Unfortunately, the nail-puller end had a defect in the casting and broke in a very mild prying situation. Although these bars are ""life-time guaranteed"", they appear to no longer be available and the phone to the company just rings and rings and the toll-free number has been changed and is now owned by a discount airline ticket company.Once again, a guarantee is only as good at the person or company that makes the guarantee. In this situation the guarantee appears absolutely worthless. The company was bought by a investment company last year which has probably stripped Olympia Tools clean by now. If you find these on clearance, don't be afraid to buy them, but....don't pay retail. If you are going to pay retail, buy something that is actually guaranteed."
4,I read it so much my 26 month old sister memorized it.,This is my favorite children's story because of the verse and the charming illustrations. The fact that is was pertinent to my own sense of tidiness only added to its appeal.
5,Exceptional Children's Book!,"Jennifer knew as well as you... that this book would stay with the reader for YEARS! My only wish is that Norah and the publisher realized how readers wish they would reprint this exceptional book so that even more children could enjoy the rhythm of language. Jennifer knew! Do you?We always ended the book by adding...""She is all dressed up and ready for company!"" Well, we are ready for her return to the book store shelves!"
4,MANY TWISTS!!!,This is the forth novel of Joel Goldman`s.. He knows how to weave several story lines at the same time seamlessly!!! Look forward to more of his great crime novels!!!
5,Deadlocked - forever on your mind!,"Once you pick up this thriller, it will take time to set it down while you anxiously wait to jump back in. It is too exciting to read without taking a break. Joel knows how to create suspense and keep you on the edge of your seat. Highly recommend to anyone who enjoys a mystery,"
2,Broken bits,"This is good food but it's not packaged well, resulting in approx 1/3 of the pieces being broken crumbs or mere powder.My cat eats neither crumbs nor powder! This catfood is too expensive to lose so much. They need to package this for shipment much better than they do."
3,A little different,"It's a little different than I thought it was going to be. Illuminated it still looks lovely, but in the light it looks like of hokey because the butterfly (which I thought was plastic too) is more of a cloth-y add on. Overall it still looks cool, I just prefer it in the dark."
2,One disk was a bad apple.,"We enjoyed watching this first season of Wagon Train--until we got to Disk 10. It could not be watched at all!This was a new, sealed set. We hope we can get a replacement for Disk 10. Is this possible, Amazon??"
3,they are o.k.,"If I had thought more about it, I probably would not have bought them. They are a nice color, but too thick for wearing with the shoes I have."
4,Great product but...,The skates were shipped quickly and fit true to size for my daughter. They seemed sturdy and made well. I did have to return them and buy the single blade skates because I learned that none of the indoor rinks in my area allow the double blade skates.
4,Good hand book in general,"I am a process control engineer. In general, it's a good resource book for me to get some concept about the refinery process."
5,Nice,I don't use this wallet all the time so I can't speak to it's durability at this point. I use this for when I don't want to carry my heavy purse when shopping. It fits a few credit cards and my ID and cash and a little bit of change. I wouldn't try to put more than 3 credit cards or a lot of change in it but if you are using it for the same purpose as I am it is a good wallet.
3,Disappointed in appearance,"I love the size and color, but after only a few weeks, I'm not crazy about the fact that the leather is really worn-looking. It's soft, without a sheen, so it scratches easily."
1,"Sloppy, disconnected, and dull.","Ah for the days of a linear plot and a novel that is not so self indulgent it blurs the line between fiction and non-fiction by being neither. Such is Jack Kerouac Is Pregnant, an amateur outing that rides soley on its clever title."
4,Wonderfully Sad,"Simply put: You've never had so much fun getting so depressed. A Great melancholy band and great musicianship; from Iowa no less!Best songs: Spotlight, Revolver and Forcing My HandThe only way this CD could have been better was if they had added the song ""Protocol of the Rats (the Big One)"""
3,CD player went bad immediately...No Disk error,"I loved this unit... the size, the sound, the footprint. And the name SONY. But just after a few times, the CD player went bad. Now, when I put in a disk, I simply get a ""No Disk"" error. It has become a Radio-Tape boombox, no CD. Very disappointed. Then I went on the web and found others have been having this kind of problem with other SONY units and bemoaning the loss of the once revered SONY quality.I understand things can go wrong and I am left wondering whether this was a stray problem or due to poor manufacturing quality. In either case I am stuck!"
2,Disapointing,Upon reading the back cover of the book I thought that it would be an extremely good read but it was not at all what I expected. It was depressing and the ending just leaves you hanging. I WOULD NOT compare this to She's Come Undone - SCU was also very depressing but it was a much better book.
2,"I had higher hopes, but it's not the worst thing I ever read","(That award goes to American Psycho). But for such a young author, Rebbecca Ray shows a considerable amount of promise. It would've been nice if the book had been broken up into chapters, instead of just running on and on. Also, I found it a little ridiculous that this 14 year old girls parents didnt seem to mind the fact that she was dating a 31 year old man.There were flashes of promise in this book, but those seemed to be left by the wayside as the plot seemed to stumble along at points, never really coming to any kind of closure at the end.All in all, like I said, it isn't the worst book I've ever read, but there are so many good books out there, I wouldn't spend time reading this one."
2,was glad to finish this book,"I don't think the back cover description of this book really gets to the heart of what the book is about. I stayed up late to finish it, not because it was such compelling reading, but because I wanted these characters out of my life! Plus, I guess I was hoping for something redeeming to come at the end. I just couldn't help but wonder about the actions of the parents -- both towards each other, and towards the fact that their daughter was dating a man WAY too old. I shudder to think how much of this book could be autobiographical!"
2,It Only Keeps You Reading To See If There's Ever A Point,"When I read the back of the book, I was very excited to start ""Pure"", as it looked like a book that was going to be a page turner. It turned out to be a book that I skimmed over. Half of it rambled on and on about nothing in general, and I only finished it to see if there was any real plot to it. The ending was, to say the least, unsatisfying. This is a good read if you want a book that goes in circles, with no real ending."
2,pointless,"I like many of the other readers who read this book wanted to enjoy it. From the description on the back, i thought to myself She's Come Undone. This in no way could be further from the truth. There are many themes in this book but it just does not move. The first 100 pages was enjoyable but the next 300 pages says the sam thing ovr and over. In SCU you cared about the main character, here you don't. As for the ending, I thought someone ripped pages out of my book because this ending was nothing. I cannot recommend this book and advise people not to buy it. I think the biggest fault of the book was that the whole time the author wanted me to think ""look how deep I am"". The ironic thing is that she never went pass the surface."
2,Don't judge a book by its cover...,"I picked this book up based solely on its cover. The design was eye-catching and I thought this would be a great coming of age story, something I could relate to. I was so wrong. This is a very ""out there"" story. This story was almost painful to read. I wanted to grab the main character by the shoulders and shake some sense into her. I cannot imagine that growing up in the UK is all that different from the US; if so, I thank God I grew up in the states. I have a daughter myself, and it hurt me to read about this young girl's quest to be accepted. I gave this book two star because the content bothered me so much I kept reading in hopes of a happy ending. Unfortunately, there was none to be found."
1,DRIVEL! PLEASE SAVE YOUR MONEY!,"I am ashamed to say I did finish this book instead of putting my time to better use. I kept hoping this pathetic creature would somehow learn from her mistakes and overcome her miserable existance. No luck there, and it wasn't skilled enough writing to make me consider the meaningless existence we all share (if that was the point?). The writer dropped out of school to finish this book and I certainly hope she considers going back. If this book is an example, she has no future in fiction. If I could have given this book a negative star I would have. It is truly the worst book I have ever read."
3,I'm not sure what to think,"I am a teenager myself, the same age as the author when she wrote it (16 years old) and I am not sure what to think about this book. Perhaps it was the first line of the book that made me buy it...I was interested to see where it would go. I wasn't very happy with the subsequent reading if it, however. It is very realistic and raw. Certainly not sugar coated in any way. And in that, I was very pleased. The writing was amazing. In a way, like a 400 page poem. Very detailed and emotional."
4,Excellent read,"A very refreshing novel. On reading it i could not stop but reminisce of the times i spent back home. Hamid hits the social strata in south asia perfectly. On one hand you have the jet-set (mobile phones, pajeros, personal power generators, industrialists, Johnny Walker, yuppie parties) and on the other there are the rest (analog phones, suzukis, power breakdowns, wage earners, russian vodka, gate crashers).The novel circles around Daru who falls from grace by getting himself fired. After this he finds himself in an endless social decline only to end up with a career in crime. In this endeavor he takes his drug peddler Murad Badshah as a partner in crime. When a long planned heist goes awry Daru finds himself on a trial for a murder he may or may not have committed. ...."
5,Fantastic,"This is a fantastic book.First, it is a heart-racing thriller.Second, it is a brilliant analysis of a society and a time. It is like going to Pakistan with a good friend who can show you every alley in Lahore.Third, it is a strange sad story of a man letting his life spin out of control, except for desperate incomplete efforts that send his life spinning even further out of control."
5,"A dark, literary read!","This is a rather dark and literary novel. Mohsin Hamid's Moth Smoke is the story of a man's road to self-destruction. Daru has lived a decent, good life in Lahore, but things quickly change for him and he descends into a life of drugs and deception. To make matters worse, his reunion with an old friend named Ozi makes things worse for him. Ozi has done well for himself, something that Daru cannot handle. The differences between Ozi and Daru only serve to bring about Daru's fall sooner. Daru's downward spiral occurs against a backdrop of heightened nuclear tension between Pakistan and India. Very bad things happen rather quickly in this novel. Daru tries to keep up appearances of being a success, but his deceptions quickly catch up with him. His lack of wealth and power and his need for the same lead to some staggering twists. I enjoyed Moth Smoke. This is one of the darkest novels I've read in quite some time. I highly recommend it..."
3,"Good enough, easy read","Here's another potential airplane read - quick, has some action, a little edgy, and you won't have to carry it home again. Drugs, and sex, and failing to please your family, and stewing in your own mess. Definitely fiction, I had no misconceptions that this could possibly represent an accurate portrayal of Pakistani life and/or culture. Maybe a little like a Pakistan version of ""Bright Lights, Big City"" even?"
2,Pure fluff,"J.C. Herz may be able to articulate herself well, but the subject matter warrants more than what she offers. The content of the book is already well known my any video game scholar or enthusiast; she has no real new ideas or revelations. And there are other books, such as Kent's Ultimate History of Video Games, that are more suited for a person new to games. She is a gifted writer, however, and her use of metaphor is well done. I would not recommend this book to anyone except those that must read every video game book known to humanity."
1,Sorry but this is not the jump on it,"Sorry, but for any real Montrose collector this is not the Jump on it that was out a few years back not even close to the songs that where on the album from 1976 with the nice red panty's as a cover w/a little leg showing but come on people get it right sorry this is not even close"
2,"doesn't fit ""old"" wave",Turns out this does not fit the old waves (my in approximately 8 years old). Nothing about that in the product description....
2,Buyer beware,"This product is EXACTLY what you see. There are no instructions, and no guidance in identifying the tool necessary to remove the pieces from your Leatherman and insert this piece onto it. If you already know how to do all that and have the tool required this is the item for you - otherwise you will end up trying for a bit, then putting this item away and never looking at it again, effectively throwing the money away - donate to charity instead."
3,Dull and Worn,"Gregory McDonald's FLETCH REFLECTED is the end of the story line (I think), but not the last written. This one lacks the sharp dialogue one associated with the Fletch novels.It features Fletch's son in a southern compound of great wealth and deep hatred. The story just doesn't work for a Fletch.Nash Black, author of HAINTS."
4,great for the price,"I needed this for a coffee break event and it worked well, nice variety of teas and nice case. They were individually wrapped and labelled."
3,Wonder,"About 1/2 the people like this and 1/2 don't. Wonder if one group are customers and the other group are employees. For us, it was OK, nothing special though."
1,"Don't buy, terrible fit",I purchased 3 of these for out class because the gloves we used smelled terrible and were falling apart. The instructor and students would rather wear the old gloves because the fit is SO BAD. Their constantly adjusting them due to the terrible form and the thumbs keep popping out. Terrible design and fit.
5,R u ready to ride????,"Break out the headphones, put ur feet up, medicate and get comfortable because ur in for one of the sweetest trips ur audio senses have ever taken. DJ Johnny Vicious makes sweet love to the turntables like only he can on this ""Concorde"" flight that begins with a smooth take off, flys u to the stars and brings u back and down like only a seasoned master DJ can. This mix is timeless."
4,But its out of print,"Amazon may have copies, but the publisher tells our bookstore its now out of print. I liked the book, and decided to adopt it for our Perl/CGI course because the book we had been using went out of print (CGI/Perl by Diane Zak). The campus bookstore informed me that the book was out of print. oh well."
5,Nice sheath,"Having always had a leather Leatherman case, I was anxious to see how the nylon cases would carry/wear, and I'm quite pleased with it. While it's wider than the tranditional tight leather cases, it doesn't seem to stick out as far."
5,Bruce Brooks At His Best!,A marvellous book on Jerome and Bix who are very realistic characters. It is a very deep and sad story with an unexpected ending.YOU'LL LOVE IT
5,"I think ""The Moves Make the Man"" has great sports writing.","""The Moves Make the Man"" is a great novel about the strange relationship between two young boys, Bix and Jerome.This is a story about two young boy, who become best-friends. They become friends when they meet each at their school and have to take Home Economics class when their mothers are in the hospital, so they have to cook for their family. The story goes on and in the end Jerome ends up miising, so of couse it is up to Bix to tell his story. To find out the entire story read the book. Eventhough it was for school I still ended up enjoying the book."
2,not worth the read,"This book was reviewed by middle school teachers for our library. We all agreed that although the story was good, it was hard to follow. This book, also, has a tremendous amount of swearing in it! Therefore, we chose not to add this to our library collection. We are very surprised that this would be a Newberry Honor Book"
1,Compare and contrast,I was very surprised that a lot of peole thought that this book was bad.I thought that the book was gripping but I guess that is just my oppinion. Even though the book had absolutley nothing to do with basketball I still thought it was a pretty good book. But not as good as 5 stars
1,extremely poor detector,"I have owned many radar detectors, and the ESD 6700 is by far the worst. I am not just saying this. It has the absolute worst sensitivity and only quietly beeps (at its loudest volume) when a police car is about 50 feet in front of your vehicle. I always see the cop before the detector begins to beep. Ka band sensitivity is even worse! With this band, it beeps only once as you are passing the cop, and not before. This is no joke. I took my first ESD 6700 back to the store because I thought that it was defective, but the second one was just as bad. As the signal gets stronger, the beep frequency does not increase, it only beeps about three times for about three seconds very slowly until you pass the threat. I am fixing to throw it away, it is trash!"
1,Phone failed after less than two months,This is a piece of garbage. The phone won't hold a charge for more than one call. I've had it for less than two months. Don't waste your money on these jerks.
2,Go with digital,There is a lot of static with this phone and the charge doesn't hold. Sometimes the conversations sound like your talking from inside a tunnel. We're going to switch to digital. I wish I had noticed this was an analog phone when I bought it.
1,Broken on arrival,Wish I had read the reviews before ordering. Ours was in pieces on arrival as well. It was a very disappointing Christmas to say the least.
1,Didn't work,"This item felt like it was working, that is I got the ""tiggle"" and the hair ""fell"" out but grew back, I have treated the same hair 3x and it is still coming back. I was optimistic when I ordered it, hopeful when I used it and discourage when I couldn't return it! The return policy allows for 30 days and the item directions say to use it for 60 days.... the math doesn't quite add up.... anyway I wouldn't buy this item again, although I would SELL it to you for 1/2 the price I paid if you want to take your chances.... shopgirl6691@comcast.net"
2,Hastily written with superficial character development,"Who could be bored by this potboiler? I was. I enjoyed the first hundred pages, but the thin, predictable plot dragged on and on, until on page 290 I quit reading. Ugh. The characters were idiots. The author repeated details about them halfway through the book that the reader had been told at the beginning. The descriptions of clothes, jewelry and homes were repetitious, too. Yuck.I can't believe people enjoy these kinds of books. This one was not only mindless, but a giant cliche. John O'Hara does this kind of society thing much better. Read ""Ten North Frederick"" instead."
2,Behind closed doors,"This peek into the world of New York Society confirms for the reader that the idle rich are tremendously dull. Based upon the true story of Ann and Bobby Woodward, the novel is involving but the characters never breathe; instead they have been recruited from central casting. We have the WASPy, old money family, the showgirl, the ineffectual, weak son plus a chorus of devoted Irish maids and homosexual designers and novelists. Dunne has done the remarkable: taken a true story and whittled it down to cliches. The florid prose doesn't help either, but I am willing to give Dunne the doubt as we are reminded at times that the story is being told (or concocted) by a Capote-esque novelist with a grudge.Time hasn't been kind to the novel. Definitely a beach read, but not much more."
5,Highly Recommended,"As one who's been hiring and firing in the public and private sector for almost 40 years, I can tell you this book is a gift we ought to give every staffer. It's basically a highly readable workbook, a tool for understanding the true nature of human character and how to develop it. The reader will be greatly impacted if the material is treated as a personal devotional guide, reading it slowly, meditatively, contemplatively. Guinness touches the very essence of the subject. Who we are ""when no one sees"" is who we truly are.Highly recommended."
2,production 5 - main male performance 0,"I love musical theatre - not all but most, Broadway, London, other European, unfortunately so very few are available on DVD. The production values of this show, the dancing, singing and most of the acting was excellent but what on earth was the actor portraying the main character ""Huey"" (or the director of the show) trying to do - a bad copy of Michael Crawford in the awful British TV series ""Some mother do have 'em"". This ridiculously over the top performance spoiled the show for me, apart from the fact that I could hardly understand a word he was saying or singing. I fully agree with the previous review - subtitles would have been helpful."
5,A good re-read,"I enjoyed this Janette Oke book. The main character is male instead of female, which is different from most of her other books. This book is what I can Brain Candy. When I read it I'm using my brain, but I don't really have to think. I enjoy re-reading it every once in awhile."
2,Usefulness short-lived,"I bought this item to replace one that was all scratched up. The only noticeable difference between the old and new one (besides the scratches) was that the new one is a bit thinner. Well, after about a month of usage the board had warped so badly that it didn't sit on its 4 feet anymore but on its sagged center part! The only way I can still use it without wobbling is to turn it over with its feet sticking up in the air and the board resting on its edges. I know that one is supposed to replace these cutting boards periodically because of germs and stuff, but a month? Come on!"
3,Excellent hard surface,"When I noticed that there were not four pads on the bottom, there were two. If it came that way, great. I easily ripped off the other two and put it in a neoprene sleeve to use as a mousing surface. It works great for that purpose! I wouldn't trust it to last in a kitchen though."
4,BJ,Found this to be an enlightening book. The essays were helpful for my course study in the Spiritual Life of the Minister.
3,Too much going on,"Though this book is well written as far as correctly spelled words, grammar and interesting characters and topics, there are too many plots and subplots. It would have been better to have left out some of them in order to explore a few more thoroughly. You're just getting involved in one plot, when something else is thrown in. There is enough going on with a bitchy rock musician with a dark past falling in love with a previously straight woman who embraces her new-found sexuality without so much as a second thought, without throwing in an ex-husband and his girlfriend, child who isn't even his, dead drug dealer,various addictions, and more former girlfriends of the musician than I can count. Pick something and let it evolve.I'm not certain if this is a first effort of the writer or not. She certainly has talent and I'm sure her future efforts will improve. Just don't try to cover everything in one book. Too much confusion."
1,HORRIBLE PRODUCT & CUSTOMER SERVICE,"Bought this G4 computer about 3 months ago and it would not work; it only turned on nothing else. So I thought maybe it was my monitor or possibly the video card, tried about 200 different ways of getting this computer to work and could not. I then took it into a VERY respectable computer shop who did some tests to try and find the problem. After 2 weeks of tests they said that one of the main boards (similar to mother board) was fried and that the computer was useless and fixing it would cost more than I paid for it.So, I contacted the seller to see about exchanging or returning it and the lady was just about NO HELP AT ALL! She said sorry if you would have contacted me earlier or not taken it to a shop then MAYBE we could have helped.Terrible service & product, I would not recommend purchasing from this seller."
1,Don't waste your money,"I have to say that I have hated most answering machines that we have owned but I especially hate this one. First, the light that indicates a message blinks way too slow. So, if you look at it quickly as you come in you don't even see the flash and don't know there is a message. Second, the remote access feature has never worked for me. Third, we have had this machine for about 6 months and it is already dead. Somehow it decided this past week to open the phone line and keep it open. I have no idea how long my phone was ""off the hook."""
3,No-frills basic digital answering machine,"I have not had one long enough to know about reliability, but I can discuss features. This machine is a very basic, low-end, inexpensive model:--It does have the 2 ring/5 ring tollsaver feature. --Each message is limited to 45 seconds. --No date/time stamp. --No ""memo"" function. --If you retrieve your messages remotely, they stay on the machine, and the message counter still blinks for them. I don't think they can be deleted remotely."
2,Disposable Answering Machine,"This product worked great, considering its price. Then, after 3 months, it stopped working at all. Considering its price, I shouldn't have been surprised. I would recommend buying two, in case the first breaks."
1,Completely Unintuitive - Stay Away,"Stay clear of this machine....it is not user friendly (you even need a screwdriver to change the battery), the buttons are not easy to use and many of them need to be operated in a way that, at first glance, doesn't make sense and is not consistent with other machines out there. Forget about trying to use the remote answering feature without the owner's manual handy. I got so frustrated that I threw mine in the garbage after a couple of weeks and bought another machine."
4,"""Brother! What an Album?","it had been a long time since i'd heard this one...packed full of some of his earlier material, this album was a delight. never thought of myself as a fan of ""disco"", but that was the most common comment i heard when sharing this with friends or other musicians. liked almost all of it, especially ""Room To Grow"",""Seventeen Going on Twenty One"",""Let's Just Live Together"", and""One Last Night Together"". why there was never a ""hit song"" from this album, who knows? the combination of extremely talented musicians, along with Elliot's unique songwriting, are still worth including in anyone's music collection. do yourself a favor. GET THIS ONE"
4,A truly wonderful story and a great acting performance.,"Not only was the movie a great hit, the song ""Mama"" was beautiful and I would love to know the name of the vocalist so that I could order the CD. Again a picture without the swearing and the abuse of four letter words."
5,Awesome,"Anvil are an amazing thrash band, we need all their albums reissued so all us metal heads can have em. This is pure, no crap metal right here."
1,$6.oo wast,"i got this cd at a used cd store for six $$, and it is not worth that. it is a hunk of shit. this is for the fans of man o war, blind guarian, and other junk like that. but to a metal fan with true tast and is looking for something more 0riginal u should move by this right now. The band may have some skill but thay do not show it.i mean that the first song is the only kinda creative one. smooking green, killer hill, face pull, come on people i like metal blade but this is a joke. sorry"
1,Totally dissapointed,"If you're a huge fan of VH pleeeeeeaaase, DO NOT BUY THIS, excellent songs collection but the thing is that it has POOR VIDEO AND AUDIO quality. I recomend you to buyVan Halen - Live Without a NetandLive: Right Here, Right Now, they have the same songs, BETTER QUALITY, believe me, it's not worth it when you are a huge fan and pay more than 20 bucks for this kind of joke"
1,"Dry, crunchy, stale","During the course of the reading of this book, I found that no amount of knowledge is worth the effort of trudging through such monotonous, grey-scaled descriptions of occurences. Unfortunately, that is all there truly is to describe, as it functions merely as a chronology, never delves into the background of any event. Sentence structure is rote and repetative. Opportunities to delve into the more interesting aspects are consistently ignored, and the reader is left wondering whether anything at all truly had a cause. In short, a stereotypical bad history book that avoids all semblance of attention-holding structure. If you are planning to actually spend money on this book, do not. It's not worth the fifty cents I paid at the library to get a card to borrow it."
3,Too few questions,"The game itself works well. But after only a few hours of play I began getting the same questions again. The questions on the website in special categories such as oldies music, have only one question per dollar amount. So it's very easy on those to climb to the top. I would prefer a much larger question bank and more of a challenge."
4,another grat dancemania cd,"i have a few dancemania cd's and this is a good one, not the best, but definatly worth the money..."
2,Bell Bicycle Computer,It is reasonably accurate. The numbers displayed are formed irregularly. You can't zero it out by zeroing one category i.e. Distance. The price is reflective of its quality.
5,An engagingly told autobiographical remembrance,"In My Father's Bakery: A Bronx Memoir by Marvin Korman is a relaxed, impressionable memoir of the Depression and war years, focusing on the lives of a family of individuals, their friends, and their neighbors. Korman reveals just what it was like to grow up in a Jewish family, personally discover the ups and downs of life, and a great deal more. An engagingly told autobiographical remembrance with full tribute to the hardworking souls that persevered at their jobs day in, day out, In My Father's Bakery is welcome and rewarding reading."
2,"Not too bad, but get Glenn Doman's books","This is not too bad for beginners, but if you want a true method that will change your children's future forever, don't hesitate to read all of Doman's books, starting with ""How to teach your baby to read"", and following with the Math book and the Physical book. Believe me, the difference is huge, and if you are going to invest time on your children, do it right the first time."
5,Best book for teaching kids to read,"I have taught 3 of my kids to read with this book. I highly recommend it to anyone. I love the fact that it doesn't have pictures to distract kids or tempt them to guess at words. With this book, reading seems simple, and it is. When my kids have finished this book, they are ready to graduate to regular picture books."
5,Simple and Effective,"Used this book to teach reading to three kids (4 to 5 years old) and had consistent success. We did a page a day and stayed on a page until completed successfully. The book is plain, with no color and no pictures, so might not appeal to all, but worked great for us."
4,UBER-PHAT DANCE GROOVES,"Crystal Method takes up where Prodigy or Orbital left of. This album has the sort of trance/technofunk that one'd love to hear at raves -- gut-quiveringly powerful yet garnished with enough voice and surprises to suggest a spirit in the machine. Stuffed with variety and changes in tempo and dynamics, I expect at least 100 listens before I remove it from my player (assuming that my ears can last that long attached to my head). Shut your eyes, look into the flashing lights, let your body move and hold onto your ears. Great stuff."
5,Crystal Method plus,"I have found this to be my favorite Crystal Method album of all. While I really like both Tweekend and Vegas, I sometimes find the songs to be too similar and repetitive. But as a mix disc, Community Service gets the balance just right for me: the solid Crystal Method groove throughout, but with a greater range of styles. There are a couple tracks from their earlier albums but they really do the job with their mixes of other artists like Orbital, Dastrix, and my favorite track P.O.D.'s ""Boom"" -- a slamming break-remix of an originally plodding alternative song. An excellent disc throughout; I hope they will mix some more."
4,Better than TWEAKEND.,"Cool disc if you like TCM. Better than TWEAKEND though not as wicked as VEGAS, COMMUNITY SERVICE is a continuous mix of great electronic music with very little vocal disruptions. These guys create the best remixes and are top of the heap in techno. Cool, cool stuff."
3,Cassie's Last Goodbye - Shawna Delacorte,"DESCRIPTION FROM BACK COVERHANDSOME BUT HOMELESS...When a down-on-his-luck drifter appeared on Cassie Brockton's doorstep, willing to work for just room and board, Cassie decided to give the guy a chance. Sexy, dynamic, hardworking, Trent Nichols had soon charmed the socks off all the locals. Trouble was, he was trying to get more than the socks off her, and she wouldn't have anything to do with that!Trent was totally confused. He was deceiving Cassie about his background, but he knew that once he told her the truth she'd throw him out on his ear. The feisty blonde needed him, even if she didn't realize it yet. How long could this deception last?"
1,Very Cheap materials and doesn't work,"***** DO NOT BUY THIS PRODUCT ***** This is a very cheap product, plastic parts break-off fast, does not work as described at all. I couldn't even use it for one time."
3,One serious defect,"This is a very handy way to direct water flow to where it is needed, not the driveway, walkways, etc. The Achilles heel is the hose connection, which if you tighten enough to stop leaks, strips off the flange. The tripod is then useless. Widening or strengthening that connections would make this a must for home owners."
1,Is everyone going crazy?,"Having bought this album in the good tradition of the previous series of JDJ albums to say I was disappointed would be an understatement. Coldcut are just showing off a record collection that any decent music fan would already have. Jello Biafra speeches yeah very good been done before and as for the ""I got rythmns I havent used yet"" sample, try and take a look at the Dirtchamber sessions (Larry Howlett) to see how it was used on an album that was mixed properly. And why we are on mixing well if there is any on this album please help me see where. It jumps fro track to track going up and down like a seesaw, no rhytmn or style whatsoever. This would be the third Coldcut album I have bought and I am yet to be impressed. giving them the benefit of the doubt was a mistake I have now eventually learnt from. Go invest in some new tunes and stop dredging up this pile of parc. Consider yourself slated."
5,A life changing book,"This book brought more insight than any bible, any lecture, any priest or preacher or deacon has ever brought to my life. totally turned it around. I loved it and recommend it to everyone i know."
1,Please Stop,"If you had a son or daughter take their own life, would you try to profit from it? This is a sad sad story of a sad young man who took his own life to become closer to his delusional mother. Wake up, Anne. You talked all this physic nonsense and new age mumbo jumbo to your vulnerable and hurting son. And you have the audacity to write a book in his name after he is gone? This is not his story. It is your sick, twisted story, told in your words. Not his. You are evil."
4,Great but not to good to help someone overcome a lost loved one,"I thought the book was good. However I was getting it to overdome a lost one. The first half is not about that issue and the second half has some issues I wouldn't sujest for people with a lost one to read.. so it's a good boook to read, but not for someone who has lost a loved one."
1,portercable model 8624 19.2 volt charger,"My second charger failed with just over a year of use. Lasted just long enough to get out of warranty. Have never had a bosch, dewalt or makita charger fail. I do not understand why PC will not admit there is a problem and fix it. How can they afford to lose their customers? Has any one tried the new charger that charges multiple voltage batteries with better luck?"
4,Review of Sony WM-FX197 Walkman,"I've had this product for about a month, and I'm very pleased with it. I work in a store and I thought that there would be a static problem. The reception is quite good and very little static. The volume doesn't go quite as loud as my previous Walkman. The belt clip is a major asset for me. The batteries usually last for about 60hrs. The headphones are more than adequate. I didn't see a need to shell out more money for options that I wouldn't even use anyway.I thought the price was reasonable. It would of been nice if this product came with rechargeable batteries and a charger."
2,Good only for three months,"This started out to be a good buy, but it only worked properly for three months. The small size and look are great. I also found it easy to use. Unfortunately, it has started cutting off all incoming messages after nine seconds. The manual states that it is suppose to allow for a sixty seconds message. After only three months of use we are forced to buy a new answering machine."
2,A waste of money,"There is better stuff out there. Difficult to figure out how to use. Actually, impossible. Don't buy this one."
1,contains stories from other books,I was so disappointed in this book. It says it is book three but when it contained stories from book one and two I just was angry. I may not go on to read the rest of the series because of this. In the very least I will read the negative reviews to make sure I am not paying twice for the same stories.
1,An Expensive Experiment with an Unsatisfactory Result!,"As a natural redhead, sunscreen should be part of my daily routine; but I can't stand the sticky, goopy feeling of sunscreens. I thought a powdered sunscreen could be the miracle breakthrough! I was sadly disappointed. I used it on my neck - other than rubbing off on my clothes, I think it worked okay. When I went river rafting, I dusted the Colorscience sunscreen powder over my all day sunblock, hoping for better protection; after a few splashed drops of water, the Colorscience dripped down and I looked like my face was melting. Eventually it melted into my eyes and stung horribly! After a few uses, the brush doesn't retract anymore and I end up getting the powder all over the bathroom. So, Colorscience is not a sunblock panacea; it is expensive, washes off and is messy to use."
5,Great Steps,"Easy to install (1 hr), looks great, and makes it a lot easier to get in my '93 2500 Suburban lifted 10""!"
5,Kids love 'em!,"My kids, ages 9 & 12, immediately put these on their bikes and now spend countless hours trying to beat their own speed records and seeing how many miles they can amass. They loved riding their bikes before, but now there's a whole new aspect to it. This item is easy to use and to affix. So far, no problems whatsoever."
4,Very realistic!,"Enjoy this verison more than any other, this verison the actors seemed as though they could have really lived the story."
4,i washed it but not whatched it yet,we have the movie in vcr form so we liked the movie be fore we bought in dvd form ok
3,Not as good as EMMA starring Gwyneth Paltrow,"This is a Good movie, however I did not enjoy it near as much as the 1996 movie EMMA STARRING GWYNETH PALTROW. This movie has bits from the book that the Gwyneth version does not have and vice versa. Was just not as charming for me and I love Jane Austen."
2,Ummm...no thanks,"Please do not bring out ye flogs and whipping posts. I just didn't like this version of ""Emma"". Specifically, I REALLY did not like Kate Beckinsale's take on Emma. She came across as snobby and frankly unlikeable. Maybe that is staying true to the literary character but still, not a pleasant person. Maybe I can blame Gwenyth for my dislike, she spoiled me with her sweet, naive portrayal of Emma. However, many reviewers here have valid points regarding this version of ""Emma"" (Knightley, for example, seems to be just right) but in the final analysis, I'm sticking with Ms. Paltrow"
5,Truly the Best Emma,This Emma is the best production. The others don't compare with this one. Kate Beckinsdale is very good as the lead character and the production is much more realistic than the others out there. Emma is a difficult book to produce it is a bit thin and shallow. This is the first show I've seen that has made Emma as realistic as possible. It really works! I found myself engaged in the story and feeling for the characters. It works.
3,Emma - miss matchmaker,I enjoyed this film but I was looking for a different version that I prefered.
2,Emma,Having watched this movie once is enough for me. I found it rather tedious. My personal opinion is that Kate Beckinsale's ( Emma ) lacked professional acting skills.
3,It could be so good...,"Although this adaptation (one of three) of Jane Austen's novel is faithful to the plot and general mood of the book, it is not the best of the filmed versions. It could be, but for the central character. While Gwyneth Paltrow made Emma a generally nice person who was just a little inexeperienced and meddlesome, Kate Beckinsale makes the character genuinely hateful. Emma is mean; she is a snob; she is not someone you would want to know. She is also remarkably cold. Mark Strong as Mr. Knightely does a good job. He is closer to the right age than Jeremy Northam, and although he appears to be constantly angry, it would be difficult not to shout at this Emma whenever you saw her. Samantha Morton is a far superior Harriet Smith to Toni Collette's bumbling idiot, and Olivia Williams brings a lot of depth to Jane Fairfax. Generally, this is a very well done adaptation, but Beckinsale is seriously miscast, and it mars the whole picture."
4,AIR POLLUTION DESIGN,"This book is an excellent choice for engineers trying to design and model air pollution control plants, equipment and processes.It also gives useful details on installation and operational costs."
2,Flawed in translation,"Capek is a brilliant and creative writer, whose musings are well worth careful translation into English. Sadly, this edition's been insensitively translated, with characters forced into the type of ""working-stiff"" American English that Isaac Asimov does so badly (and Bruce Springsteen does so well by avoiding a patronising tone). The Damon Runyanesque argot sits uncomfortably with the Central European setting of these tales and for me renders them unreadable. Such a great opportunity missed! Such a terrible thing to do to great literature! PLEASE edit the translation into something resembling English....then I'll buy 3 copies and tell all my friends to get it. As of now....no."
1,Poor quality,"Poor quality bulb. You would be better off to purchase a #3893 automotive bulb at your local car parts store and use it. Even though it is listed as being a 12 volt bulb, it will still outlast the 19.2 volt bulb here."
3,The Overpriced Average Bar,"The reason I bought it was because of the special curved end on it. It pryed well but after a couple of years it broke 1 of the 2 nail-pulling teeth on the end, rendering it almost useless. I would not buy it again, it's not as high a grade of steel as I thought it would be for the money."
4,Jingle collar,"We had an old one for our previous Schnauzer, so I ordered two new ones. The only problem is I ordered small and should have (and will) order Medium. That would be my only complaint is there is no description as to what size dog a ""small"" will fit.It is a great little Christmas collar and I love the way it jingles!"
4,Great Scanner for the price.,"I did my research and found that this scanner more often than not has been recommended for use by other photographers. I down loaded the driver from the Microtek web site and had the Scanner up and running in about 30 minutes. My first attempt was with a set of 120mm negatives, here is when I found out I needed the ArtixScan film holders. I am in the process of acquiring them now. In the mean time I am working on making sheet plastic templates for the negative sizes I wish to scan. The positives I have scanned are nicely detailed and the software is easy enough to use, even the advanced settings are not that hard to figure out. If I where to buy another I would make certain it included the film holders."
3,Great system if,"This would have been a great scanner for the money. I could not get it to scan one picture after the other. The scanmaker program would freeze up on the second scan. Loading the software also created problems on my machine. Connections to the USB port would not stay connected, the computer lost knowledge of the scanner being connected. I worked through all their solutions to the problems, but could not cure them. The scanner has excellent features and seems to be built very well. I have had two other Microtek scanners in the past that worked great, but had to return this one after a month of trying to remedy the problems. It is very possible it will work great in other systems than WIN 2000. Good Luck"
1,to long,It's been on my wish list for a year...takes them forever to get it. If costumer is looking for something to buy you should get it as soon as possible.
4,Sufficient for the price,"What can you expect for $150? The 506V takes OK pictures (slightly blurry) and Ok video. This is the multipurpose PixieCam I always wanted but never got. The battery case cover is flimsy and prone to coming off. The best part is that it uses AAA batteries - no difficulty replacing power when you are far from an outlet. My expectations were not that high, so I wasn't dissapointed. In the end, this camera/camcorder is a toy."
2,Adequate,"The best word that I can come up with to describe this camera is adequate. I did not expect this camera to be spectacular, but I did think that the camera would take decent pictures in dark places. I was wrong! This camera requires a certain amount of lighting. You can change the the brightness of the camera but that only helps a little. The pictures tend to be somewhat grainy if taken a few feet away. I did not try using the mp3 player, nor will I ever because I have no use for it(i have an ipod). I did end up getting a better but more expensive camera. Overall, I would recommend this camera if you are only going to use it in brightly lit locations and do not mind grainy pictures. If you want memorable good quality photographs, I would reccomend investing in a better camera."
2,good but still don't know how to use flash,i got my dxg 506v from my sister for free i still don't know how to use the flash
1,"P.O.S., even for the low price","Bought this for someone else for Christmas, and we both were immediately very disappointed in the quality of video produced by this camera. I could comment on the physical aspects of the body, but why bother if it does such a poor job of the one thing for which it was built?Poor colors and clarity outside on a bright day, and miserably grainy video indoors in a well-lit house. I have a 4-year old Canon powershot that does better video than this DXG.It's a waste of money, even at this low price point. Don't buy, even for a beginner. You can apparently do much better - I sure will next time."
5,Awesome product,The Porter Cable production pocket 552 is a MUST for any woodworker!! Strong and tight joints make this machine one of the most used tools in my shop. I like to keep extra bits on hand incase one breaks in the middle of a project. Amazon was the cheapest place I found this replacement bit for my pocket cutter. Now i will be prepaired If my old bit should break..THANKS AMAZON!!!Brent
3,"Leaves abit to be desired, but so did/does the ""official"" investigation.","I thought the movie left me sorta just hanging out there and didn't answer my questions. But on the other hand, those same questions aren't answered in the real world even today. All in all, a movie worth seeing."
2,Overpriced,"I bought this book for work and school but when I got it, it was a let down. First off it was overpriced for what you get because it is very short and the definitions of the terms are basically the same text with different phrases.I could have gotten the same information for free on the internet."
5,bobby eldridge,"Bobby does not look like the normal pro but as an instructor he is excellent. To benefit from a DVD you have to watch it before you play and then after.My chipping has been so good that my friends call me ""Bobby Eldridge"".I have several of his DVD,s but this one(short game) is the best."
1,Drill is great...charger is not,"I purchased a 14.4 volt drill several months ago and love the power it offers, though it is a bit heavy. After only about 30 uses the charger has stopped working. For the price you should get a decent charger that will last. I have two Dewalt cordless drills that are older and have had no problems with them. I am very dissapointed in the porter cable charger. I have purchased several of their power tools and they all work great. I build custom furniture and use power tools daily."
2,8604 Review,"I am very disappointed with the charger for my PC 12 volt. I should have know that something was wrong when the initial charger quit working 2 weeks after purchase. Since it was still under warranty I got a new one. It has lasted approximately 3 years and now this charger has gone bad. Bad transformer. I love the drill and flashlight so I guess that I will be forced to buy another charger. I wish PC would stand up and notice this, do something about the design and offer a improved product."
3,Easy Fix to avoid new purchase,I have one of these used by the family company on jobsites for years and now at my house. It went bad but it's not the components. The power supply is attached to the circuit board by two wires soldered into small slots. Inserting the battery shakes the board and eventually breaks the connection loose. 10 minutes and soldering iron and it is fixed.
3,heady stuff,"This book is excellent, although a bit heady. It seems to be aimed at professional healers. Too tough to read as a lay person. Some sections were applicable. However, ""Light Emerging"" by the same author seems more digestable to the average user."
5,The Ultimate Healing Bible,"Without a doubt the very best book for the aspiring healer. I recommend it wholeheatedly to all my students. Well written, this book has stood the test of time and continues to be widely regards in the healing community. Sketches and diagrams of the chakra system assist healers to authenticate their own psychic intuitions. In short a masterpiece - the information it contains is priceless. Review by Jeanette Wilson the medium & healer on SKY REAL LIVES Televison & TV3 New Zealand"
4,I feel the basic truth in this book ...,"... I can feel the truth in Barbara Brennan's work ... This aligns with my Balancing and Aligning Chakras using Jonathan Goldman's healing vowel sounds (...) and a Chakra Balancing course I am just now in the midst of from (...)In my edition of the book, it still shows a Long Island, NY location for the Barbara Brennan Healing School. If that were so, I would be making tracks out there, as I live in NY. It looks to me that one cannot truly read the book for application without taking a course, and I say that as a person who knows pretty well how to study on my own.(...)"
2,Too technical,This book is too technical for the beginner or someone that knows a little about this subject. It is written too much like a text book that should be used along with an in-person class. I would not recommend it.
4,Perfect resource in any healer's library,"If you are interested in healing work this is a great book to read and keep as a resource. I found it difficult to push through the first part of the book, as it deals with things purely on a scientific level. The rest of the book is very enlightening and I could not put the book down. Barbara says that everyone can learn and apply these techniques- I wish the book contained more exercises. Coincidentally in the middle of the book I was watching a healer on Dr. Oz, who I later contacted, and he also recommended this book to me."
5,Handy to have around,"At first I was disappointed to see the new style. I can see the locking mechanism weaaring out and bits just falling out of the Leatherman. Leatherman's never let me down in the past, let's hope they keep their good reputation with this new design. The usefulness of this bit set goes almost without question. I carry it with me all the time and it's proven itself on several occassions.If you want to fix almost anything almost anywhere, this bit set is good to have."
2,Product description is inaccurate,"The product description says:""What's in the box:Leatherman bit kit with 21 double-sided bits, removable bit driver, nylon belt sheath.""but this product does not include the removable bit driver, so it is not compatible with leatherman tools such as Juice requiring the adapter (Leatherman Removable Bit Driver Kick Fuse Blast Vista Core Juice Knife. Since I didn't want to spend another $20. or buy a new Leatherman entirely, I ended up returning the product."
5,Great Set of Tools,This bit set adds a lot of versatility to leatherman tools. One word of caution make sure the bit is fully inserted before folding the tool up.
4,Nice addon kit for Leatherman,Bought it as a addon kit for my Leatherman Charge.Here is my take on this kit..Pros -1) High quality bits2) Decent carrying sheath3) Very Compact for carrying (Belt or bag)4) Bits lock well on the Leatherman toolCons -1) Works only with Leatherman tool2) Very short reach3) Redundant kit (if you already own Many hex bits and the Bit extender driver for Leatherman)4) Lots of useless bits (You may never need many of those bits)5) Lots of standard bit not included (The ones needed for bikes and bolts)Overall an average kit. Recommended if you can ignore the cons !!
3,not quite what I expected,I thought the bits and the tool would fit together in the sheath. It only fits one set and the sheath. It seems just a bit odd.
3,Erotic Victorian lit....,"Eveline is erotica at it's extreme. More often than not she was having sex with her father, uncle, cousin, brother, vicars etc. It was a bit repetetive and slightly boring. For those of us whom can't fathom an incestuous relationship, be prepared to be shocked. I think stunned would be the appropriate term for what this book did for me and why I've now read both books. I think reading both books solidified that actions such as those contained in this book more than likely took place. If you want to be shocked...or learn some rather interesting techniques...read this one and the previous---Eveline"
2,Worst tennis announcer ever,"This book is typical of an announcer who thinks any sporting event is about himself and how much he can talk during it. I (thankfully) am not exposed to him on telecasts other than tennis but that is plenty.Do you think someone commentating on tennis matches for 10+ years would (or should) know NOT to talk continuously THROUGH the points?They should and he doesn't. He ruins every tennis match he talks, babbles and mutters over. His hallmarks are: long-winded never ending run-on sentences (about nothing), beginning to talk almost every time a player throws the ball up to serve (ensuring he will talk over and through the entire point), and dominating the amount of talking. If there are 3 announcers he will easily STILL talk 60-70% of the time!This book is more hot air from a know-nothing self absorbed announcer. More worried about what THEY can say during a sporting event than paying attention to what is actually going on."
5,Heat gun,"Wore the first one out stripping my house. Works great, heats up fast and deflector work great to spread heat so that I can use a stripping blade to remove paint.Received the in a timely fashion which I was grateful for since my other one wore out in the middle of my project."
5,"So convenient, ease of use","I have a long cutting board I use to use, but in a small kitchen in an apartment it was so awkward, and heavy to use. This board is thick, study and easy to use. I would dread having to cut up vegetables to stews and soups. Now I just take out this small board that helps me to cut up onions, celery, carrots quickly. It is great for apartment living and to teach anyone who is just starting out how to cut and chop. Can't do without it. I thought it was a little bigger than how it appeared."
1,"Very, Very, Very Small","I'm very disappointed to see how small this cutting board is. You can only fit ONE orange on it. Unless you are looking for a cutting board just to cut limes/lemons/or anything very small, then get this. Otherwise, don't waste your money...and this cutting board is not cheap! I would not recommend this item at all. For the price, you can buy a bigger cutting board and use it for multi-purposes. I am forcing myself to keep it since returning it costs $5.20 so it's not worth it. It is my fault that I didn't look at the measurement properly. I made a big mistake and have to pay the price for it."
3,"It' better than the leather version, but still is poor design.","Leatherman is still one of my favorites for multi-purpose tools, but lately they've been on the roll for designing things that are ""cool"" and, well..., of poor utility. What was wrong with the original, push-button closure, leather case for the Wave?"
5,Masterpiece!,"I first saw this film in December of 1969 when I was 16. It NEVER has left my mind and I watch it even now 4 or 5 times a year. It has a relentless beauty to it. The sight of Miss Fonda alone on the dance floor after her partner (Robert Fields) has left her--trying to contain herself by biting her lip--is one of the indelible moments of the cinema.The silly folk who criticize the picture for the ""flash-forward"" technique employed throughout (and it became cool to do so BTW) obviously never read Horace McCoy's novel, because it was chaptered using cinema flash-forwards. I love all the acting but especially Jane's. Hardnosed, cynical, defeated by life, her Gloria is unforgettable."
3,If You've Never Seen a Movie About a Dance Marathon...,"This movie is worth seeing if you've never thought much about the dance marathons that were put on during the great depression. Who knew these things went on for over a month!? Jane Fonda's performance is good and, although the movie drags a bit, you remain curious about how it will all come out in the end. How it does come out is a bit strange and pointless, but then so were the sixties when the movie was made."
5,Great iron,"This is probably the 20th iron I have purchased over the years and it is the best. Lots of steam, extremely fast, you don't need to go over and over the fabric to get tough wrinkles out. The base is wide so it doesn't tip over. Highly recommend."
2,great iron but it leaks out rusty water and stain the shirts,"I love that it does the job well when it does not leak out rusty water. The iron glides well but abit heavy to use. I have always use T Fal irons and for some reason, this one doesn't work so great."
3,nylon sheath,"Prefer the leather case, but this one does fit the Wingman we got for our 9 year old Grandson. First he got a smaller one at age 7"
4,Good average sheath.,"This sheath is just fine so far. I like it better than the standard leather sheath. I have a slight worry, though. The hole for the open Wave tool to be put through looks like it may begin unraveling. I haven't even use it for this yet. I always close my tool up before inserting it back in the sheath. I will be keeping an eye on it to see if it gets any worse. Looks like the weave of the material is loosening up, but hasn't actually separated at this time. I am hoping it is just the way it looks."
4,I didn't like it at first.,"I got this sheath when I bought my Knifeless Fuse. It is too big for the Fuse, so initially I wasn't happy. But I bought the Fuse to go with my Victorinox Camper Plus. The two fit well in the sheath.Lately, I've been clipping my Jet Beam BA10 flashlight to one of the loops on the side of the sheath. It's a little bulky, but it keeps me from losing any of the three tools.The Velcro has held up for five months now, but it is noisy.I like the sheath a lot, now."
5,Great,My original sheath that came with my Wave started to wear out after 5 years of wearing it every day at work. I looked at other sheaths but decided to get this one since the other one lasted so long and it has a pocket for the 40 piece bits and holds the extension as well.
3,A casual coffee-table book,"The Dictionary of Science Fiction Places is near-completely useless if you use it the way it is intended - to develop your vision and understanding of a specific scientific locale. I can certainly say that the odds of you reading something that is described in the book are slim to nil (outside the obvious entries, like Pern, which was perfectly mapped out a long time prior). The art is completely inappropriate and does exactly nothing for the book's value. The only way the Dictionary of Science Fiction Places may prove useful is if you casually flip through it to find some long out of print and offbeat works of science fiction."
5,good by snow rakes,"once you use the sno-knife you will wonder how you did without it. it is so much faster and easier than anything out there. I have had one for 4 years now, and used it a lot and it still looks like new. It can be used to clean decks too."
3,Arrived Damaged,"I can plainly see why most of these would arrived damaged, there is no cushion at all inside the packaging. Did not care to return and wait a whole other week or two so I grabbed my pliers and my crazy glue and made it work. I did take pictures before the repair. The box looks very nice but could have been better packaged and a better quality build."
5,Thick,"This is thick gauge steel, not aluminum tin. That and the ornamentation of the beveled corners and front is what makes this mailbox better quality than a standard mailbox. However there are some architectural mailboxes that are a clear step above this in terms of design, but the price doubles and they aren't any sturdier.This is a good standard mailbox that will last.Hope that helps."
2,Cheap,"I was really disappointed by this mailbox. It's incredibly cheap, and challenging to put together. There was no way the flag would stay up until my husband (a machinist, thankfully) messed around with it for quite a bit to fix it. The pictures shows a smooth side bar at the bottom sides, when there are screw holes there, and cheap covers that are not likely to stay in long (screws not provided). It's just so cheap and flimsy, that I really regret ordering this, but will keep it to save on return shipping costs for this large and heavy package. Let's just hope it doesn't rust. :("
3,Nice large mailbox,"Mailbox shopping was a little harder than I thought it would be but eventually I settled on this one and it's worked out well. It's large and solid. The price seemed a little high but maybe it's worth it. Mine came with white side rails instead of black and they made me send back the entire mailbox just to swap them out, which was annoying. I wish they could have just sent me the new rails and saved us both alot of work. They should also come with black screws but don't actually come with any mounting hardware at all.Update 8/20/2012 - My mailbox has been falling apart. The flag fell off and one of the hinges fell off. I'm going to try to get replacement parts."
1,Pool/Spa Thermometer,The item does not have a good seal at all to keep water out. It shorted out within the first week. Threw it in the trash!! Waste of $$
1,POOL THERMOMETER,This thermometer didn't even last a week before water leaked into it. The display became foggy and then it wouldn't even give a valid temperature.
2,Fragile,"bottom broke off when grandson dropped on the deck, lasted less than a day in the pool, needs to be made more durable."
3,"Some strengths, but some weaknesses","Each chapter contains exercises (matching, reading or writing, unscrambling words, identifying action within a cartoon, etc.) and word puzzles (such as crossword puzzles) designed to increase vocabulary and familiarity with words. Answers are found at the end of the book. It also contains a glossary and brief grammatical reference section. The advantage of the book is the variety of exercises designed to increase familiarity with Spanish words. The disadvantage is that, although there is a brief grammatical guide at the end of the book, most beginning students would need another textbook to explain the grammatical concepts used for the chapter. It may be useful as an adjunctive workbook for a class. However, as a self-learner of Spanish I would recommend other books instead of this one."
3,No better and no worse than others,"I've owned around 15 or so of these type of cleaning disks, and all but one (Including this one) were about the same. A word of advice, if it says you can do multiple cleanings in the directions, then always do 2 in a row. Because none of them clean as good as they say. This one was fairly cheap though."
4,Money well spent,"I had my doubts at first, but that's history. I bought this to try out on my Arcam CD-72 player thinking, maybe...just maybe...I'd get a few extra sound nuances previously lost over time. I did and then some. Further, the tutorial included on the disc is helpful in more ways than one. Money well spent."
5,Worked to solve problem I had with Panasonic DVD recorder,"Put the Allsop DVD and CD Drive cleaner into my Panasonic DMR ES15 DVD Recorder and when it finished working, my problems with discs not finalizing or error messages stopped. I also found that Verbatim plus DVD blank discs worked better in this machine than the Verbatim minus blank Discs I had been using so I'll be using those in the future too. I was able to finish using the rest of the minus discs I had with no problems. Product does what it's supposed to do."
5,Great product. I found the cause of my CD's skipping,"This cleaner is well designed and is easy to use. There is an impressive test verification procedure on the product that works well. I was having a problem with CD's skipping and after using this cleaner the problem continued, however I did find the real cause and easily corrected it. I had taken the PC burned music Cd's out of my 2001 Camry changer when I recently traded it for a newer Lexus ES series and although they played perfectly in the Camry they skipped and cut out in the Lexus. I ran the cleaner with no improvement, but after researching further I learned that CD's created at a fast burn rate can cause this problem. I burned new ones at 4X and problem solved. I am very pleased with the Alsop cleaning disc and will use it to clean our computer drives and DVD players as they need attention also."
3,Seems OK but didn't work for my problem.,"I think this product probably does (most of) what it claims to do, but unfortunately it didn't fix my DVD player. My DVD player has intermittent and inconsistent problems reading/recognizing DVDs (brand new DVDs, library DVDs, computer-written DVDs, all types). Sometimes it reads them and works fine, and sometimes it ejects the disc and refuses to read it.Hoping that it was just a dirty lens and considering the reviews, I tried this product. The product disk has a number of tufts of fiber designed (I think) to clean the laser lens. It didn't work but didn't do any harm either. My player might have some other problem, then. I'll save this drive cleaner in case I ever need it for a computer drive."
4,Works well,so i gave it a 4 star. I thought it took too long to go through all the items in the cleaner dvd. Worked well with my panisonic dvd palyer.
2,Does not cure all ills,"The CD player in our 2001 Toyota Avalon would only randomly play PC-burned CDs. It would reject them outright or they would skip once started. The problem was not the computer's CD burner, as the CDs played on our 03 Avalon's player as well as on other machines. Manufactured CDs seemed to play fairly well. (We burn Audible books to CD for listening.) This product did not fix the problem; in fact, there is no difference in the player's behavior for having been ""cleaned"". The problem could well be a slight misalignment of the laser or something else, but be aware that this is not a cure for all ills. Two stars because it might work well for some, and is not necessarily mislabeled - but it did not work for me and I would not recommend it to a friend without a cautionary note."
3,Does it work ?,I used it to clean my computer DVD drives. I followed the instructions on the monitor but at some point the system just got stuck in a loop while it was testing the suround sound. I just ejected the disc. Couldn't tell if the lens is cleaner now or not - I guess it worked and I'll keep using it once in a while.
3,It didn't work for us,"Many reviewers had goo luck with this product; however it did not solve the skipping problem with our DVD player. Our player is about 10 years old, and it may have reached the end of its expected life. The product seems well made and it is easy to use. I will likely use it after our new DVD player arrives."
5,Best bit for cut-out drywall tools,Title says it all. A must have for any cut-out tool. I use the dewalt and prefer it to my co-workers rotozip.
3,Flashback,"Not the original ""rough and tumble"" Tygers. This was an '80s revamp album. That's when I got it the first time. I bought it this time out of nostalgia. If you're looking for the hard-edged Tygers, this is not what you are looking for. I like it for nostalgic reasons."
1,lacking Christian values,"Far be it for me to interfere with a comic in search of schtick, but if Mr. O'Rourke is truly moved by the impoverished values of these 3rd World places, perhaps he could volunteer his time to improve these places."
5,Magical,Pearcy's second album equals her first in pure brilliance. Her clever lyrics and intimate music draws you into her world.
2,Not for people with a good ear and not to really enjoy music,"This player has very poor sound quality for audio and radio play. CDs are Ok to listen to, mainly because CDs themselves have better sound quality. The stereo sound is very bad and CD programming is not very helpful too. For people with good ear and sensitive to the external noises, it is not a good item to buy. However, for people who just need to listen to some quick news on the radio, it is OK to have it in the kitchen...."
1,Purely for beginners,After skimming through the book I found that it was hardly sophisticated as it was originally described. In fact what I read and saw was highly remedial and just plain common sense content. The book did not go beyond the very very basics of painting. I really don't know who I could recommend this book to. If you are seriously considering being a painting contractor this book would hardly prepare you.
2,Be careful with this company,"I purchased these earrings, and got them appraised. They were appraised at less than what I paid and got appraised at $245. I contacted NETAYA and they encouraged me to send them back for a free appraisal. They have since sent me back the wrong earrings that belong to another customer and sent my earrings to the wrong person. I am not a complainer but have been given a run around and not been told the truth. So while the earrings are pretty, be careful. FYI- I still don't have them back."
4,Very nice earings,"I am by no means a expert when it comes to diamonds or jewelery, but I did my research and read a ton of reviews and came upon these. They were very nice and I could not see any flaws with the nake eye and the color was very good as well. Great price and quick shipping. My girlfriend loved them! 1/3 ctw is a bit small, but I wasn't willing to fork over the cash for bigger and didn't want to skimp on quality."
3,Pain = Growth,"The Pain of Being Human crystalises all those thoughts you had about existence - but never wrote down. Lucidly written without the usual psycho-babble that psychologists like to impress us with. Another book that gave me greater insight into the pain of being human, was the inspired ""The Autobiography of Jesus of Nazareth and the Missing Years"" by Richard G. Patton. Patton's Jesus is faced with the unimagined dilemma of his own spirituality being confronted by his immense humanity. I enjoyed both these books but came away with a greater understanding after reading Patton's book. Admittedly Patton's book is written as a novel where Kennedy's book is written as a dissertation. Kennedy's book is accessible and sure to become a standard on Psychology. Recommended"
4,Not bad for Lucille Ball.....,"Pretty good movie, and funny, but not as funny as some movies (like, the Long, Long Trailer). I thought Lucy acted confused, and not at all like the comedienne we all know and love. However, this is good clean fun, and seeing Desi as a scientist was great fun. Very funny at the end too!"
1,DO NOT BUY. The item feels like a old used and stiff towel,You get what you pay for. Do not buy this item (unless you want an old and stiff towel for a cover. I would advise to spend a little more money and buy something softer. I am sure these are durable though - but not very soft. Maybe it will soften up after a wash or two - but we ordered another option for us and we will see if we can use these for emergencies or just donate them to goodwill.
1,Not As Good As It Used To Be,"Since Procter & Gamble moved production to Mexico, the product doesn't seem to be nearly as good as it used to be. The Scalp Therapy used to really tingle on my scalp and now it doesn't do anything other than just sit there. Apparently, they closed down the U.S. manufacturing plant and started producing Nioxin in Mexico. It appears to me they may have also changed the formula. Either way, I don't perceive the same thickening effect it used to have. This is unfortunate because I used to really love this product line."
5,simply incredible,"First off, I never knew that there was more than one Oz book. This series includes the first five Oz stories from the creative mind of L. Frank Baum. I purchased this for my daughter, and have to admit that it is very well done. The stories, characters, music and sound effects have kept her (and the entire household)entertained for hours (which is so much better than having us vegging out infront of the TV). Congratulations to the people at the Colonial Radio for doing such a fine job, with any luck, they will do all the remaining Oz books. Our whole family recommends that you give this series a listen."
5,A wonderful rendition of Debussy's operettas,"This is the only known recording of Debussy's ""L'enant Prodigue"" (Prodigal Son), and it is superbly rendered with excellent orchestration and vocals. The orchestral preludes to the two operettas, especially ""L'enfant Prodigue"", are beautiful. My only complaint is that there are only two tracks on the CD, one for each operetta. However, given their beauty, one is not tempted to skip around, but rather relax and listen to the CD in its entirety."
1,The funny little woman and her adventure,"This little Japanese woman loses a rice dumpling in a large hole in the ground. The hole leads her to some evil ""onis"" that capture her and make her cook rice for them. They have a magic paddle that makes lots of rice from only one grain. The little old woman tries to escape with the magic paddle. Through her laughter and being funny she outsmarts the ""onis"" and gets safely back home. I feel this book lets children see that there can be a good ending to the scary things in life. Just keep looking at life like the little funny woman did."
4,Great book for beginners,Perphaps one of the better golf books designed for the beginning golfer. Easy to read.
3,PC 13700 Replacement Pad,"I've had an experience similar to P. Bates. This is also my third pad. They seem to deteriorate over time. I live in Florida with its high temperatures. However, I keep my tools under air conditioning, which should minimize heat caused failure. I think Porter Cable should be able to design and fabricate an orbital pad that doesn't disintegrate. Let's see how this one performs."
3,"Call me stupid, but...","I would have expected a zero clearance from the bearing to the cutter. When I traced the hinge onto a template and cut it out, the result was that the mortise was 1/16"" inside the pattern on each edge. So you either have to cut the pattern over-sized or break out the chisel and mallet. This makes no sense to me. You also need a 5/8"" or 3/4"" stock for the template for your usual hinge leaf depth. Other than that, it cuts fine."
3,Well produced versions of the books,"Even if you've seen this series - read the books. The books are not your typical murder mystery series - they go into the characters in great depth and have of course a much larger cast of recurring characters that can fit into an episode of television.Now a few comments that are probably very picky: the Barbara Havers character is way too pretty, but it is understandble that an actress looking like Havers is described in the books would not be palatable to viewers. Also - and wouldn't mention it but it's brought up many times in the books: Lynley should have blond hair. Maybe they couldn't get one for the TV series, but the books make SUCH a repeated point about Lynley driving a Bentley, it bugs me that he drove something else on the shows. Lastly, and Nathaniel Parker is a good looking man... did they have to put him in such tight sweaters? Not exactly flattering - watch and you'll see what I mean."
3,Needs a light,Great item. Only real drawback is the little screen needs a back lightAnd needs a seperate cord for the extra battery
2,Motorola RAZR V3 Charger,"I wanted to use this device in an Europen voltage situation (Iraq). Unlike most charging unit which are dual voltage, the transformer is only good for 110 volts and not the 220 which exist in rest of world. The product description did not make the limited use distinction clear."
2,Be aware that this strategy does not work!,"This book is about low-correlation asset class investing. This strategy is deeply flawed, and was seriously damaged in the 2008 financial melt-down... the very kind of thing that this strategy was supposed to protect against. The reason was very simple: Most asset classes correlated and plunged together, except bonds and precious metals."
5,Wow!,My first graders loved this book! The details in the illustrations kept them captivated. We felt like we were really on a roller coaster ride! My kids wanted to read it over and over again.
2,"not for ages 4-8, for much younger",The age range listed on amazon for this book is extremely misleading. I bought it for my 7 year old nephew and it's more appropriate for my 2 year old daughter.
1,Please spare me...,"I am a huge fan of Robin Williams and he didn't let me down as far as his acting goes in this movie.However, I did not enjoy watching this one. The son was extremely disgusting, so much so it was unbelievable, and the whole premise that every teenager and adult in the school suddenly started idolizing such a disturbed teenager is over the top.This is a ""Black"" movie, but I would not call it a comedy. I found nothing funny about it and it left me feeling depressed.This is one Robin Williams movie I wish I'd passed on watching."
2,There's an emptiness in this film.,"I wish I had truly liked this film and even now I'm not sufficiently sure why I didn't. What could have been true to some degree or other was phony, and I'm not just talking about the script. Of course the exploitation of his dead son and the cheating ambition of ""Lance"" the father of ""Kyle"" the impossible son was bad enough, and the ending far from satisfying or even understandable, but the premise, to me, was even worse.One reviewer on another website said it best: the film couldn't decide whether it was comedy or drama and tried to be both but succeeded at neither. But some of the dialogue in the early part was so gross it was good. The direction was tight and quite okay as was the cinematography.I'm not sure what, if anything, could have made it better."
1,Horrible - Horrible movie,"The main character in this movie finds his teenager dead one day and decides to hang him in the closet from a belt. It's absolutely horrible, terrible movie. Don't confuse this with traditional Robin Williams movies that inspire you. As a former fan, I will never watch another Robin Williams movie again after watching this one. And I never used to pick movies by the director but I'm not watching another movie made by this loser again either. Worst movie ever."
5,"Canon A620 , Very Good Choice","I had very good choice whem i buy Canon A620 with 1 GB KIT. Recomiendo a todos los compradores, que cuando requiera una camara compacta se decidan por esta excelente camara."
3,"Great Picture, but slow, slow, slow Shutter speed","This is an all around great camera. You really notice quality difference of 7megpixels. But if your shooting the baby, or anything else that moves - this camera will make you crazy, just like every other digital camera I've-you've owned. The shutter delay, and recover time(time till you can shoot again) while somewhat better than earlier cameras is still maddening and frustrating.John B"
1,canon A620,"Unfortunately. I never received this camera. Although I placed the order back in August, the shipment was post-poned several times. When delivery was post-poned for the last time (for me, at least) on Oct 28, I allowed the order to be cancelled. By this time, this discontinued model was difficult to find, and I ordered a different model, a Kodak P880, from another seller. While the price was the same as offered though Amazon, I did not wish to end up in another delay situation. This situation would make me reluctant to try to purchase similar items from Amazon in the future."
3,Disappointing performance,"I've owned this camera for two years and taken 528 photos on three vacations. Then, suddenly the image processor failed. The only option is to send to Canon for a repair costing nearly half what I paid for the Camera plus shipping, and wait at least two weeks.Im shopping for another camera and it won't be a Canon Powershot..."
4,Large and Lovely,"While somewhat ungainly in shape, this is a marvelous technical camera.It takes excellent pictures, saves photos rapidly, cycles quickly to allow rapid photography, and is more frugal power wise so batteries take more photos. Its movie mode is so good, it competes easily against many digicams, but in a far more portable size. The movable LCD viewfinder is as effective as the legendary rotating lens made famous by the Nikon coolpix. Over 6 months old, my camera has taken some abuse and is alive and well. Some users have warned against jamming the lens mechanism, so I've taken care to insure the lens shaft is free of dirt and moves freely.The built-in instructions are easy to understand, but the camera falls short of 5 stars because one needs to read the manual to understand the fine nuances of programming this camera."
4,Another Quality Canon Product,"This is another quality product from Canon. For the price and quality, you would be hard pressed to find any other camera to beat this one. Images are very decent and menus are user friendly. I would have been happier if it was lighter but then you cannot get everything. I have no hesitation in advertising this model."
2,Doesn't taste like kiwi at all.,This doesn't taste anything like kiwi. Tasted like plain sugar. A total waste of my money. I don't recommend it.
4,a scary story.,"This story has a new view on an old idea: Too much TV isn't good for you. Here, though, it goes way beyond that. another great Japanese ghost story, but this time, coming from the idea that ghost's can inhabit and come through TV waves."
1,Defected item!,"I've purchased two packs and both are not functioning well.It took 4 days to charge one of the packs and the 2nd one cannot be charged at all.An email I've sent the supplier has not been answered till today, more than a week after I've sent it.Really disapponted...Rafi"
2,"Decent design, poor materials","I bought this at a local Home Depot for a customer needing doors hung with 5/8 radius hinges. On the second hingemortise the tool came apart. I did not touch it with the router bit-was just making the outer cut when an entireside of the template just broke off.I actually like the design but it should be made with metal or at least thicker plastic. Home Depot allowed me to return this tool with no hassle, but nobody else in town stocks a hinge template of any kind. I have ordered the Milescraft #1293 from Amazon and will try to review it soon."
3,Time Saver,I had to replace some door that had been destroyed by vandals. Whoever put these doors in used blanks and were inconsistent in the hinge spacing. Because the hinges had 1/4 radius corners and the homeowner was extremely fussy I did not want to spend hours with a chisel and knife and then not get the corners perfect so I bought the jig. It worked perfectly and was simple to use. I would rather have had a clamping system but the small double headed brads left holes so small that they were easy to fill and became unnoticeable. I did not have to do the jams so I do not know how accurate that would be but the door hinge mortises worked perfectly and took just minutes. For the money I would highly recommend it. If I had to do many doors I don't know but pretty much everything is pre-hung today.
2,really poor design,"Porter-Cable 59370 Door Hinge TemplateMost of the other reviewers are correct that this is an inferior product. I'm a professional trim carpenter. Others have pointed out that the jig does not size the mortise correctly and that is absolutely the case. I had to spend a few minutes shaping the radius of the template with a rasp and also shim the opening slightly smaller so that I didn't end up with unsightly gaps around the hinge. It's a cheap product, but even for the price it doesn't work well enough to justify buying it."
4,Good Reference,"I have a major certification test in February that has a business/management section. So far, this book has given me a great start in preparation for the test."
1,Disaster!,"I tried cooking brown rice - which takes a lot longer than white. It worked after a fashion, but never did the job in the suggested time, so I gave it an extra ten minutes. (Big mistake) It warped, the seal failed allowing moisture to leak, the rice caught on fire, part of the cooker melted, the house was filled with smoke, and I don't know if I will ever get rid of the stench. I wouldn't allow another one of those things in the house if Joyce Chen personally brought it to the door and begged me to take it. )-8"
3,Not good for popcorn,I bought this specifically to pop popcorn and it does not work well for that. If I microwaved long enough to pop most of the kernels it burned the popcorn.But it does a good job of steaming veggies. (Haven't tried cooking rice.)
1,Bad for rice. Good steamer.,"I wonder if the way this rice steamer is made has changed recently. I bought mine after all the rave reviews. I cook rice several times a week. I was very pleased at first. Then more and more water leaked out during cooking. Later, a plastic part of the cover that locks it on, broke. I hoped it was a fluke and bought another one. The latest one is almost useless. So much water leaks out when cooking rice that I have taken to using very low microwave settings and cooking it much longer. Still the results are disappointing. This morning it took about 40 minutes rather than the 22 minutes I used at first, and still the results are poor. It worked well steaming vegetables."
1,Total Loss,"Unfortunately I bought this product based on the positive reviews.First I cooked rice. The lid system does not keep the water from boiling over, so the rice cooked well, but it worked no better than cooking rice in a mixing bowl in the microwave.Next I cooked pasta. It worked, but again, the water boiling over makes this appliance no better than a mixing bowl for microwave cooking.Next I cooked popcorn. It left many kernals unpopped when the already popped corn began to scorch. Unsatisfactory.Next time I tried to use it, I noticed a serious water leak where one of the feet attaches to the bowl. It will no longer retain water, and so is completely unusable. It was washed only by hand, never in a dishwasher.Since I bought it through the mail from Amazon, and it was only a few dollars, it is not worth returning it for a refund. So it is a total loss.Don't say nobody warned you."
4,Since I use this every day ....,"I am concerned about the presence of BPA in the container. BPA is used to make clear, hard plastics and this is a clear, hard plastic. Does anyone know?I use the cooker to steam vegetables every day and it's invaluable. Yellow and orange vegetables do stain the basket insert very quickly and the stain isn't removable, at least not with any cleaner I'd want to use on a food container. My last Joyce Chen lasted three years of daily use before it developed a fine crack in the base and leaked water. I'll be happy if this one lasts the same time. I just need to resolve the nagging question of BPA."
1,More pseudo-intellectual liberal gobbledy-gook,"Once again, yet ANOTHER left-wing screed attempting to belittle and demean the history of America, reducing the U.S. to ""male-dominated"" and ""racist"" to our core. No wonder college grads hate this country, with this kind of c**p floating around."
1,Very hard to use,The cable is so tightly wound that it is dangerous to try to use. Also you need 2 hands to be able to lock it with the key - very inconvenient & frustrating. We ended up just buying the chain that has a vinyl sleeve over it to use with a combination lock instead.
1,System Analysis and Design,I wanted to return this book because it at the beginning of class the instructor indicated that the book was not required anymore for his class. I contacted the seller and they completely ignored me. I still need to return the book cause I am not using it.http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/013608916X/ref=cm_cr_rev_prod_img
5,-or read the original.,"This is not a put down on the hard-cover or paperback of American Beauty. On the contrary. But if you would like to read the ""real"" script please read what Sam Mendes and Alan Ball took out. Very interesting."
5,The most brilliant screenplay of the past decade,"American Beauty is possibly the greatest film of the decade, at least, and without a doubt the best film I have seen in my sixteen years. I don't know if that's naive or what, if I've missed the grandeur of some great epic, but this film absolutely blew me away. It is infinately profound and affecting, and it is beautiful and poetic on a tremendous scale while maintaing subtle, understated nuances. The writing is flawless, in a word. The performances in this masterpiece of American cinema only accentuate Alan Ball's wit and depth. I cannot begin to fully describe how deeply this film affected me and how ultimately perfect it is; you have to see it for yourself. And it's OK if you don't understand what I'm saying right now. You will someday."
5,Loved it!,"I used this book to teach several of my younger siblings to read while still in my teens. My mom used this book for me as well. We all have gone on to do very well in reading comprehension scores in tests. It's a wonderful book, and I'm looking forward to being able to use it for my own children in a year or two now."
5,Great book,This book arrived in good condition exactly as it had been advertised.I am very pleased with this purchase.
5,Guide to courtesy as well as conversation,"An impeccable summary of ideas that everyone already knows about conversation and courtesy to others catalogued subject by subject. Everything in the book is useful on one level or another and explained in a simple approachable fashion. James Van Fleet is clearly an expert at interpersonal relations and explains all of his ideas with concrete examples and a motivational tone.In addition to learning about how to show others the basic respect of being a good listener and not a self-centered listener, anyone who reads this book will immediately be able to recognize bad managers, bad listeners, self involved attention mongers, as well as genuinely generous people.Read this book at your library and then add it to your home collection. I know that I am going to add it to mine."
2,DONT WAIST YOUR MONEY ON THIS BOOK,"I HAVE OVER 15 POKER BOOKS, SOME OF THEM ARE BETTER THAN OTHERS.But this books suckkkkkkssss..This is the only poker book I will used when I run out of toilet paper, but just dont take my word for it. just use your hard earn money on this book and let me know if reading about 20+ hand is worth the price.Dang I dont know how Jim brier got sucked in to this wanna be book. Mr. Brier has put out Good literature on poker.... Sorry Jim..!!!!"
1,Doesn't fit FRS 220 radio!,"The ad clearly states it fits ALL Cobra microtalk frs radios. The packaging doesn't list compatible radio models. But it doesn't fit their FRS 220 model. So basically, I have one battery in the rear slot and I jury rigged the front slot to also take just the battery. So the adage is true - buyer beware!"
1,HIGH IMPACT aerobics using a step,"I have spent countless hours doing advanced step aerobics in multiple gyms, including double-step (where you share your step with others) and rarely had any problem following.For those who aren't aware, step is designed for a high aerobic, LOW impact workout. However, high impact jumping on and off the bench are a theme in this workout(including standard jumping jacks). Most of the routines include high impact steps with no simple way to modify them to be low impact.I bought this because I really enjoy complicated routines however very little cueing is offered, and when it is it's too late to be of any real value. The ""warm-up"" was a few minutes of aerobics (including jumping jacks) then right into stretching. After the stretching the instructor goes right into the aerobics again. For me it was not an adequate warm-up, especially for what is a high impact workout.Sadly disappointed by this since the reviews were so high for this item."
5,Great for advanced steppers,"I searched high and low for a good step DVD for an advanced stepper like myself. I found this one challenging yet doable. After learning the routine I play one of the premixes to skip the ""learning"" portions of the routine and jump directly into the broken down combos. Since the cardio portion of that routine is only about 30 minutes I end up doing that twice for a good work out. I have her #2 and #4 DVDs but I find myself going back to this one the most."
5,Yeah!METALLICA!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!,THIS RULES!METALLICA RULES!IF YOU DON'T LIKE IT SUCK IT!!!!!!!!!!
1,Horrible product,"Okay, I read the good and the couple bad reviews and thought I'd give them a go... Wish I hadn't! These fastwipes should be called slow non-performing wipes cause that is exactly what they do! & Yes, I read the directions. Someone said it's like a paper towel and that is pretty much true. Might as well save yourself 5 bucks and use your kitchen paper towels. These wipes didn't even get off fingerprints. Totally useless and time consuming garbage."
5,As expexted,As expextedYou don't deserve any more than I wrote and ten more words waste my and your valuable time
3,Not Free SF Reader,"Magic not always overrated.In the second book of Robert Asprin's Myth series, our hapless heroes decide that a nice office job would be a good idea. Court magician is not actually clerking, though. Generally you don't have to do much, until someone attacks you, then people will expect all sorts of tricks. The problem being that a demon-no-longer-magician and an apprentice-know-nothing don't have a lot, at least not of the magical variety."
4,Very Nice,"The above poster is correct. It is a very nice stand, they simply dont tell you the correct way to fold and unfold it. Follow the review above, and you will be very happy with this stand."
5,Great Helmet for the Price,"My buddy was letting me borrow his old helmet until mine came in. After I used his spare the first time, he wanted to show me his newer helmet which he paid $100+ for. He wanted me to compare the weight of the two, which was noticeably different. After my first ride with my buddy with this helmet, I wanted to compare the weight to his expensive helmet. I was shocked that you couldn't even tell the difference. I handed it to him and he asked me how much I paid again. I laughed and said around $25. It always feels good to walk away with a deal. The helmet is comfortable, fits snug, and is light!"
1,Feels heavy.,"I just received and needs a couple more clicks on my head to fit correct. And if I try to turn dial to tighten, the release is on top of dial and I keep pressing it and it gets loose again. I dont know why they designed it with points on the dial. It starts to hurt my thumb if I try to tighten. I bought this cause the light weight but sticker on helmet says 298 g the description says 255. This sucks.."
3,Bell Solar Bike Helmeet,"I learned that a bike helmet should be tried on in the store before buying and not purchased as a gift for someone else on line.I gave this as a gift to my friend last week and they tried it on ...lo and behold, it really does not fit properly.Bad mistake on my part. What do I do with it now?It's brand new, still in the box with receipt!!:o("
4,Good helmet for the price,"I bought this helmet after I bought my road bike. I sort of bought this helmet in a rush and didn't really care how it looked on my big head. The fit is ok, but with this price point you can't really complain. This helmet also saved me twice as I have hit on my head on concrete than gravel. The helmet now has a dent and a crack now, but helped protect my head. Now I've moved on to a more expensive helmet (Lazer Genesis, btw awesome helmet) and if money is not a problem for you, I would buy a more expensive helmet that fits your head better. But if money is a problem, this helmet will do you just fine."
4,Superior performance for the money,"I think I paid $30 for this when I purchased it last spring through Amazon. It looks like some that cost three times that. The fit is great. The straps are comfortable and adjust easily, allowing for a secure fit. This helmet looks good, fits well and the price is right. What more could you ask for?"
2,Maybe I expected more,"Disappointing. Maybe that's my unfamiliarity with soft core, but I was hoping for a little more than I got (not on the sex side, but on the overall production).My main problem with hard core isn't the close up shots of actual penetration, but almost total lack of a story line, poor acting and cutting straight to (nearly) naked bodies going hard at it. This dvd suffered from all of that (ok, maybe there was a weak attempt at a story line) except the closeups.Won't be buying any more of this series."
4,an honest look at problems we must all overcome,"This book is at once a reflection of personal spiritual growth and a mechanism for societal analysis. Everyone, regardless of religious beliefs, can find benefit in comparing their own lives to the issues brought forward by the author. The author offers severe criticism of the struggle to retain humanism in the face of debilitating personal and societal pressures. We can all find a bit of ourselves here."
4,Good Pad,"Sometimes I need a firmer sanding surface that this pad provides for projects. As long as you keep the pad surface clean, it will provide years of service."
4,Exactly what it says it is,"The book covers what it says it does and is well written. With many references to other's work you get the good part of a bunch of books for the price of one (There is also a lot of original content).I have never read a software requirements book, but I have been writing software requirements of a long time. The book covers 'everything', so there is a lot of stuff that I knew already. It was worth reading though."
4,Dutch Fairy tales,This bok is for the slightly older child 8 and up. Adults will find it interesting as well. As a Dutch immigrant I have not heard many of these tales but that is just what they are fairy tales. A fun family book.
1,Will not help with car stereos,"I cannot help but wonder how this device helped two other people who used it on car stereos. Car CD players have a front loading mechanism, as opposed to a tray or top loading, and the instructions specifically say not to use it -- bacause this damages the brushes. If the brushes are out of alignment, as they should be after using the cleaner in the car stereo, the device will do nothing for your CD player. It helped a little with my CD-ROM, but I highly doubt it could ever solve the neverending issue of a dirty car CD player."
5,Good quality,This pool brush fit my aluminum pole handle perfectly and works very well for brushing my pool areas. The brush seems to be well made and a heavy duty construction.
2,Lacking in some places,"As far as content goes this manual is lacking in up to date therapies, and has a limited view on differential diagosis.Pictures are great, though, and in one small handy book. But, if you don't know what you're looking for it is very hard to find"
4,"Not that bad, probably my xbox is the problem","This cleaner was my third attempt to clean my old xbox drive. It sounds exactly like the radio shack cd but it has more bristle tufts(it has eight) that are placed about an inch apart around the inner ring of the cd and each tuft has lots of bristles compacted together in an area about as big as a pen tip. After blasting my lens with compressed air,with no effect,i ran this disk and my game ran for about an hour with no skips before freezing. Its probably my thompson drive being shoddy and not this product."
1,dont waste the money,"Dont waste the money.Used multiple times on two different units, did NOTHING to either......DON'T BOTHER."
1,If anything only made it worse,I ran this through my Honda CD player numerous times and it still skips. I finally gave up on it.
1,did not work well,did not work that well. did not do as prompted as soon as i went to the cleaning track it said done !!! did not go through the cleaning process
1,Didn't work for my CD player!,"Thus, I don't reccommend this product. But if it worked for others, it might work for you."
1,Never showed up!!,Hi guys well now we are well into the new year and I never received this item and most of all I have had no response... so can you please credit my acct!!! Wish I had something better to say ... but right no mas..
5,favorite hair dye thats been discontinued,I've used Loreal Natural Match 7C Dark Ash Blonde for years now. It is (was) a great product. I was deeply disappointed to find out that Loreal discontinued it. But very happy that I found it on Amazon.
2,Close but not correct replacement parts.,Very specific instructions on how to order replacement parts(using model #)were followed but parts sent did not work with our mixer. Parts are being returned. Would like to have talked to someone to correct this issue. We still need new beaters for Model 1-8B Sunbeam Mixer.
1,wrong item,"I don't know how this product was listed but I clicked on a model number and it showed the ""new and used"". I then chose these from that menu and ordered them. When they arrived, they were a wrong fit and there was a lot of back and forth communication between the seller and I, and they sent back the product number that matched my order number. I asked for an exchange but they said they do not carry the right model. When I went back online to reorder, it took me to the same screen that says that this seller does carry the correct model, I clicked on it, and it brought me back to the ones that I had already orderd that were not correct. I have never paid much attention to the product number when shopping under the ""new and used"" but I have learned that when searching for something that has to be specific, compare the model numbers before completing the order."
5,It fit me so well I laughed out loud.,"This is a great book for anyone that doesn't understand why other people don't think about ten things at the same time. When I read the description of a hunter living in the world of a gatherer, I started laughing out loud. It was an exact description of where I fit in the world. After reading this book I was not only comfortable with being an ADD adult, I became proud of it and enjoyed it."
1,Find one that works,"I got this ratchet in a spline socket set.The ratchet was DOA. SK told me to take it to a local distributor, so I went the 40 miles to drop it off there. That outfit knows me on a first name basis, because it took 9 1/2 months to get the replacement.The ratchet is nicer than the mechanism on my favorite Craftsman 3/8"" 42794 flex head ratchet. But I'm afraid to use it, and wonder what will happen should it ever need service again.SK has nice tools, but this is my third experience-from-hell getting replacements for defective SK tools. Much easier to deal with Sears, and oh so much more cost effective."
1,Not Your Old SK Ratchet,"I have owned and used SK hand tools for over 45 years. So I had no reservations about purchasing an SK socket set (94545) that included this ratchet. Right out of the box the ratchet did not work right. It would change directions all by itself while using. Now after using it for maybe 10 minutes it cannot be used at all. It now slips and will not lock in either forward or reverse direction. This is a huge disappointment since I have always considered SK tools to be the best hand tools for mechanics. Its not some cheap - made in China - piece of junk. It was made in the USA and I would expect much better quality from SK. Now I need to try and find a way to make a warranty claim. Also, the sockets in the set are not up to SK's normal quality. Stay away from this set and this ratchet."
3,"Enjoyable, but expected more...","Let me say off the bat I own the 2nd book in the Harrow trilogy and plan on reading it...And I'm going to buy Mr. Clegg's newest book when released. BUT, Mischief was good, just not great. There was some very interesting ideas he played with, but there wasn't a lot of resolution, and I wanted more. What sort of power does Jim have? What really happened at the end there? I could go on with additional questions, but I will say that a number of scenes were very well done and had me turning the pages at a quick clip. Overall - good, not great, but I'll keep with Mr. Clegg and his books. Thanks!"
1,Do not buy a pot filler..,"We installed a pot filler via a professional plumber last July thinking it would be a cool look to my brand new kitchen. My pot filler started leaking slowly into my stove less than a year from the day we took it out of the package, and killed all the electronics. I wish i never bought this thing, cause it's leaking from one of the joints and now will cost me serious cash to fix all the problems it caused. I knew this day would come, but i was hoping at least 5-10 years down the road.STAY AWAY - from this pot filler and all pot fillers."
3,not so great,not as stick as it claims. I used it to seal parts on showering door. The parts went off after few days.
3,Breaking the Waves,"This rotary-wheel 'beach wave distance finder' is a real delight for those living on the unspoiled beaches near the coast of Oregon. Product is fairly easy to use, simply position oneself atop of the wheel, placing one's feet upon it, wait for a wave and then crawl up to the water mark and the distance is stored inside a handy mechanism inside the wheel.You can measure the distance of the waves throughout the day after a hard day at work, what more fun can you ask for besides finding a nest of snapping turtles?"
4,some worthy songs on this one!,"There's one song I really love on this one,-track 3-, which I didn't like right away but it really grew on me and I am now addicted to it. Other good tracks are 1, 2, 4, and 8."
1,sock too small,this sock is for the small calf person or child not really meant for average adult. Probably works well enough but was to small.
4,Israel tour,I was in the air for two hours to Newark and for over 10 hours to Tel Aviv. I wore the sox all the way and had no leg problems. I recommend everyone to give them a try.
4,Good idea to have these for those long flights,I was very comfortable wearing these and my ankles didnt swell. I'm glad I had them along. Will be using these on flights from now on.
5,It simply was a Life-Line for me,"This book took me through the first few horrible weeks after my husband's suicide. The very few weeks, when I did not have energy to search for someone else around with similar experience. This book was my best friend, my psychoanalytic and Mentor. Sometimes it was very painful to read it, but it helped great deal. I still read it from time to time - usually around The Anniversaries. All I can say is ""Thank you"" to Carla for the honesty and the willingness to share her painful journey with other people."
1,Way too flowery...,I've read quite a few books within this genre and found this to be the weakest. Try SM101 or Screw the Roses...
5,Excellent resource,"For women exploring their sexuality and desires that some may consider ""differnt"" Erotic Surrender will answer your questions and help you and your partner on your journey. I thank Claudia Varrin for writting this and her other books as well. I have learned so much about who I am."
2,"Insight into the author, not the subject.","If you want a peek into a woman's mind who enjoys flights of submissive fantasy, you might like this book. Perhaps the author should consider writing romance novels featuring D/s themes.As I read I began to believe that the author is not particularly sexually sophisticated. Her distaste for and confused descriptions of oral and anal sex were odd notes for someone purporting to be well-versed in erotic submission.There were some jarring notes which set off alarm bells in my mind when dealing with her relationship with her Lord as well. I understand there is a sad lack of material written by submissive women for submissive women, but I do not think this book is a good introduction to the topic though it has provided fodder for discussion between my partner and myself. On that level it's a success, but that really isn't why I bought this book. Disappointing."
2,Not happy,Had to wait 2 weeks for it then it was the wrong item so i had to send that back and wait another week for the right one:(
5,B-Side Rides again,This is one of the best albums I have ever heard. The album is a upbeat and fusion of afro-beats with rasta-Mexican mixes. The messages in the songs are very thought provoking and hits home for all of our chicano brothers and sisters. Keep the grove Karlos!
4,Brake fast bowl works,"The bowl definitely works. The dog eats his food much more slowly. The cons of this product are that it is so light weight plastic that it slides too much. To solve the problem, I went to a discount store and bought a cheap metal bowl and took the rubber ring off of the base and put it on this bowl. That helps a lot.The second con is the price. I think the price is outrageous for a piece of molded plastic."
4,This Bowl works wonders... slows my dog down when he eats... the service was fast. and got what I expected.,... slows my dog down when he eats... the service was fast. and got what I expected.
5,Really slowed scarf face down :),"This bowl was a great purchase, my dog would eat so fast he thought he hadn't ate yet....sometimes he would even throw up just after he finished.Now he has to work around the bowl to get to every piece, and it takes a while....Just a great product for us, so glad I found it here.If you have dogs that can woof their food down in 20 to 30 seconds flat, this is the bowl for them...."
2,Not as good as Skid Stop Slow Feed bowl for our terrier,"I bought this bowl and the Skid Stop Slow Feed bowl to do a side-by-side comparison. This was the loser. We have an 11-pound terrier mix who wolfed down her food. This one slowed her down a little, but I can't really say that ""it works."" The Slow Feed bowl was twice as effective at slowing her down. (We fee 1/3 cup at a time of dry food.)"
1,The Figure in Clay,"I am a beginner at sculpting with clay. This book was a waste of money. Little to no instruction on how to sculpt. Extremely disappointed. More words than pictures, the book is mostly about the artist. Very useless!"
1,Poorly written,"I'm all for a good romance novel, but this one is poorly written and the plot leaves a lot to be desired. Skip it."
2,Not one of her best ...,"I am almost finished with this book and I keep waiting for the good part. The story is depressing, long and boring. I have read several of Judes romances and really like them. I bought this one because of the good reveiws but I am just forcing myself to finish this story. To me this is not a romance book. This is a story of past lives and the main past life is of a boy and a girl that are raised as brother and sister but are soul mates...that are kept apart by ...life in general. Where's the romance in that?"
2,It was not the best that I've read.,"Well, to me, it wasn't the greatest book that I have ever read is probably just me. I guess it all has to do because I don't like travel in time thing. But all in all, the book was pretty good, I mean, the contents were great and the plot was good, but I just thought that maybe she should have wrote more about the main characters and not about this curse and these two people who take up a whole half of the book. That to me, is just not exciting at all!"
3,Perhaps I need to read it again...,"I've only read one other book by Jude Deveraux - A Knight in Shinning Armor and thought from the reviews and the sample I read that it would be just as good. WRONG... I found that it seemed to drage long and I found myself skipping through a lot of foolishness just to finish the blasted thing.It could very well be that I had just finished an excellent book before picking this up and wanted the same literary fulfillment, which I didn't get."
3,Not as moving as Knight in Shining Armour,"The beginning and the end were very well done. However, the middle could have been done a little better. I thought she wrote the beginning and the end and then used the middle as a filler. I wanted to learn more about Lady de Grey but the most time was spent describing the medieval events and not enough on the past life regression. Although the story was not as well done as Knight in Shining Armour, I would still recommend this book to those who like Jude Deveraux."
5,AMAZING story about love through multiple lives,"This book completely rocked my boat! In a nutshell, it is a love story that occurs in the medieval ages in England, in the post victorian era in the US and ends in present day New York. The story is rife with conflict and danger and pent up romance, and has a very sweet ending. Deveraux captured my heart with a Night in Shining Armor, but with Remembrance she made a trully lasting impression."
4,This was one page-turner I'm glad read. Don't miss it!!!,"This was the first book by Jude Deveraux that I had ever readand boy was I pleasantly surprised.I was also deeply regretful that it took me this long to find out about her! At leastnow, when I'm waiting for Judith McNaught to turn out a newbook, I'll have her friend, Jude Deveraux, to read!"
5,"Love knows no boundry,nor limit.","Time is said to wait for no man.But in Rememberance,it defies that.Love is the stronger force that conquers not only the unwise but the unloved.It was the force that dorve her to search and find her soul mate and correct ,rectify the unjustice done to them."
2,this book is sloppy and unuseful,"This book is written by someone who obviously understands the subject very well, but isn't very good at presenting it. The equations contain many mistakes and none of the terms are properly presented. Any other book on the same subject would be better. If the author simply referred the reader to another book, he'd be saving the reader a lot of time."
4,Thought ...,"I just read Jonathan L Lewis's book, ""I THOUGHT WE WERE HAPPY: Lessons My Wife Taught Me on the Road to Divorce"". I wish I had read it first. I needed to heal the agonizing pain of my ex's affair before trying to get on with my life - and maybe then I could have even rescued the marriage. Ah well ..."
3,"Good info, but unpleasant writing style","I thought that this book had some very good content. It reviews the ""19 building blocks"" of divorce, going over each of the significant emotions/stages a recently divorced person experiences. As far as my experience goes, the emotions identified were all correct. According to the book, if you work through all the stages you arrive at ""freedom."" It does include information for parents, but it was separated in the chapters, so a divorcee without children could easily skip those sections.My problem with the book was the writing style. I felt like the author spoke in a slightly condescending tone and kept reminding the reader how well he knows us and how wonderful and correct his program is. So while I appreciated what the book had to say, I got tired of hearing it tell me how fabulous it is!"
4,A Terrific Guide to the Post-Divorce Wilderness,"I read this book not long after my divorce, and while doing research for my book on divorceHe's History, You're Not: Surviving Divorce After 40and found it really helpful. One of the most helpful aspects was the reassurance that there ARE stages that it is normal to experience, and that one builds on the other. The illustrations of the actual building blocks of divorce recovery make the process visual. It really prevents despair to recognize that what you are experiencing is the same thing so many other divorcees have gone through, and that you're not going to be stuck in one place forever. You can, and will, eventually move on to the glorious stage where your divorce is in the past and you are free to start a new life.Erica ManfredauthorHe's History, You're Not: Surviving Divorce After 40"
2,Hate Japanese?,The author certainly seems to hold a real grudge against Japanese people that certainly doesn't agree with my own interactions with Japanese veterans. This book is one giant stereotype with a very unsatisfying ending. That doesn't even touch the absurd premise of the book. Pass on this one.
4,Very good overview of basics of type,"Sure, you can find newer books that will walk you through software to do typesetting, but this book has some of the timeless information to introduce you to what type is all about. It has some historic information about fonts, info on leading and layouts and so on.I found this book at the library, and found it informative enough that I chose to buy it. The information did help me decide which fonts to use for a poetry book I put together. I recommend it especially for beginners, or someone who wants an in depth overview."
4,An interesting read if you already like Greek mythology.,"Like most books edited by Martin Greenberg, you get a good mix of stories. But don't read this book if you have no idea about Greek mythology - you will be completely lost, since most don't bother to explain themselves (or tweak the myths entirely, and expect you to get the joke). Overall, it was a fun read that fills up your time in an enjoyable way."
5,Greek mythology and new fiction combine wonderfully...,"These stories are a refreshing difference from modern fiction. Many are very well researched, thought out, and take you back to the ancient land from whence the gods arose. Other stories are set in modern times, with ancient dieties reacting to changes and strange new attitudes. All mix knowledge of the classics with new fiction work. Wonderful reading!"
4,interesting novel about prisons,"As an ex-con, I read this novel with great interest. It seems the author, an ex-prison psychologist, got it right: there is deliberate indifference on the part of the system to deal with those with problems, and the efforts of those who do care are mostly for naught. Recommended for those interested in prison reform, including staff and prisoners, as well as those interested in a good story."
4,Economical and efficient,"I read the other reviews and was hopeful that at that price it could be used as a back up. I was pleasantly suprised, as it is quite sturdy and has a cup holder ( a bit small) and a side pocket to hold small toys. The drawback is that there is no way to hold the booster into the seat of the car so you have to be extra careful when taking out the child that the booster does not fall out on the floor. But one you concer that, it is smooth sailing. Now that the seat is home, and I am truly satisfied I am now about to purchase another one for grandmas car. It is no spare seat, it is the real thing for moms on the go. Thanks Cosco"
5,Wonderful Book!,"This a wonderful book about a wonderful little girl that every kid or adult with the kid in them will love! If you or your kids like the Harry Potter books or books by Roald Dahl (James and the Giant Peach, Charlie and the Chocolate Factory) they will love this. If they or you haven't read those books they or you should. Lots of good, positive emotions and love in this book and a fun, witty story.Highly reccommended."
5,Things aren't always as they seem.,"If you are a parent looking for a great series of books to engage your kids and inspire them to read, then look no further than the anybodies series.THe Anybodies not only makes you want to read the the other books in the series, but it is filled with references to other children's classics, which are obviously meant to inspire your children to continue reading."
3,Might work,Might work if there was something strong to tie to--with broken strainer it requires different tool. Not a replacement for skills of good plumber and his tools
5,It works!,"I decided to go with this fuel pump after speaking with my uncle who is a mechanic. He said, ""Don't buy an airtex.Starting the car is much easier now."
4,One to have,"Just one of those movies from the time era everyone should have. The quality of the picture is nothing compared to today's feature films but, if you want to get motivated to be the best in your sport this is a movie to add to,your collection."
1,Broken right out of the box,"THsi item did not work at all. I bought it for a trip to Italy, lugged it all the way over there and it did not work - the pushout plugs would not stay engaged. I borrowed an adapter from the front desk and it worked fine. You probably do not need a transformer product like this as most devices you will want to use are already dual voltage (computer, phone, rechargable camera batteries, etc.) Just buy a plug adaptor and you will be fine."
3,Skimpy heating area,"Arrived very quickly after ordering. The actual heating pad is much smaller than the pillow bed and fits only on one side of the bed -- thus it is a bed that is heated only on one side. Regardless, my dog loves it and has to fight my cat for the small heated area. Think the description of the item should tell the consumer about the actual size of the heating pad insert in comparison with the size of the pillow bed."
3,"Pretty good, once you get past the homosexuality","I really had to detach myself from the main character because he's gay. It drastically lowered my enjoyment of the book. But, the story was actually pretty good and worth reading.For a series with the word ""Magic"" in each title, I thought the use of magic was woefully small. Most of the ""good stuff"" happens ""off-screen"" and is only mentioned as an aside.The ""hero"" was constantly described as the most powerful herald-mage alive, perhaps ever. Yet, I only ever saw him do something that seemed rather basic and then suffer for days or weeks during recover from over-using his magic.Finally, it was hard for me to fully enjoy a story that focuses so much on the depression, moodiness, and sulkiness of the hero.Still... I found it worth reading. (Though I won't recommend it to my kids.)"
5,A wonderful midpoint for the trilogy,"Magic's Promise is in many ways my favorite book of the trilogy, although I see-saw between them depending on my mood. This book adds more to the trilogy than it would seem from a quick glance over the plot. I find Van's confusions over his reactions to the other characters, espcially over Shavri, to ring very true. I am glad that Mercedes Lackey chose to include a book like this in the series. Although on the surface, it is just a murder mystery type plot with magic and featuring a character who we already know, on another level it brings up very important things in Vanyel's life. By showing him in a book where he is not in love, it allows the reader to watch him come to terms with difficult issues that could not be raised as effectivly in one of the other books in the series. I find that this book is definitly worth reading more than once."
5,Great for cleaning shrimp also!,"These are such wonderful scissors that I now own 3 pair! They live in a lovely little divided wooden box sitting next to my chopping block with other small, used every day, cooking utensils, i.e.; temp gauge, measuring spoons, peeler and large poultry shears. These scissors are perfect for hundreds of small kitchen tasks like snipping chives and scallions, trimming artichoke tips, bacon, peppers, herbs, lobster and of course my favorite tool for cleaning shrimp. Defrost shrimp, insert blade into center of shrimp at fat end and cut through shell exposing nasty vein, peel off shell, clean out vein under running cold water and drain/dry shrimp if stir frying - quick simple and easy! With imagination you will come up with your own favorite uses for these indispensable wonders!"
5,Great Kitchen Scissors,"We have two pair of these scissors, one for over a year. We have used them to cut fresh herbs from the garden, cut up cooked chicken, open plastic bags and sealed meats, and every kind of kitchen cutting. They are still very sharp. Besides being comfortable, they provide tremendous leverage when cutting."
3,quality lacking,"These are fine scissors but not great, and not worth the price in my opinion. They're stainless steel, but a cheaper grade of stainless--mine are rusting. The rivet that holds the two handles together is loose and can't be tightened. I don't recommend them."
2,a pleasing ho-hummer,"I thought its plot was too centered around conspiracy. Underlying it is a theme on greed, but since Trollope doesn't expound on it the book gets two stars."
5,Good,"These are in good package. However, it took kinda long to process the order and ship the items. I wait about two weeks."
2,Rather tedious and boring for sci fi.,"This is slow, tedious and not particularly well written. The major themes and premise of the story are quite interesting but the potential is never fulfilled. You'd be better off reading 2001 if you haven't read it yet. It has similar over-arching concepts and is much better."
4,Good--Possibly Even Clarke-like,"This just felt good to read, a little hard to pick up at first, and the rescue scene seemed unnecessary, but I enjoyed the Rare Earth theme that was depicted in the book. At some parts I had to suspend my disbelief, but the idea was so original that it was thoroughly enjoyable and I enjoyed the news the author sometimes places at the end of the chapter. One thing I had to suspend my disbelief (a lot) was the aliens, the inhabitants of Quraqua were described as looking like crocodile-head people and that bothered me, as did the crab-things at Beta Pac. Not really hard science fiction, while I read it I felt like I was ready a Clarke.Another thing that bothered me was the way the Kosmic Corp. people acted and behaved: like stereotypical evil megacorp underlings. I fervently hope that McDevitt doesn't advance more things like Kosmic in his next books."
3,Kind of boring,In the future mankind has discovered huge monuments on other planets but have no idea where they came from. The story is interesting but has a lot of boring parts to it. This book at least has a proper ending unlike some of the authors other work.
2,Disappointing,"This novel starts off with some intellectual promise, but it soon turns into an action/adventure, probably written with a screenplay in mind (these days, I guess they all are). Some chapters would make interesting short stories, but altogether, the book is a miss. The conclusion, if it can be called that, is sure to evoke a ""So what?"" - even with all the amazing events that occur, don't expect a big payoff. Additionally, even though ships in McDevitt's universe posess a ""hyperdrive"" of sorts, the book's timespan seems to be TOO quick, thereby diminishing its scope - this also holds true for the characters, which don't seem to change much... strange, considering the amazing circumstances they are put through."
3,Faucet Light review,"The light would be great, but it will not fit on my Chicago faucet. Neither of the adapters work. I've been to plumbing supply stores, and nobody can help. The 800 # couldn't help me either. So, order at your own risk!"
3,What fun the faucet light is,"from the moment we put the light on the kitchen faucet, we have had nothing but fun and awe. It is neat to see clear to the bottom of your glass, even in the dark. And it makes the water taste sooooo good because it looks like cool blue spring water. I have sent one to my daughter also, and they are having a blast with it in the bathroom, plus she reports that the little ones use it for a night light when they have to be in there for just a minute. Love it!!"
4,Decent product,"For the most part, it is a nifty little product that give you a chuckle when in use by providing light during water flow. Kids think it is extremely funny and get a real kick out of it, so it is more than worth the price just at that."
3,Ehhhh....,"If you're a cult cinema nut or a film student, you'll probably get all the jokes. I did. But this cross of incest and German mountain-climber movies of the twenties and thirties, while it certainly carries a unique visual style, just doesn't hold your interest.I get the feeling that Maddin, unlike, say, fellow Canadian David Cronenberg, is straining to be weird and obscure. This was worth the three bucks I paid to see it, in my opinion, it was fun. But a classic? No, and I wouldn't pay a lot for it either. Kino has Jan Svankmajer's ""Conspirators of Pleasure"", as well, and THAT is most definitely a classic!"
5,Five Star Melodrama,"This is the movie that made me fall in love with John Garfield. I personally think it is his finest film and shows that he could hold his own against any leading lady of his time. John Garfield was at his best as the guy who was trouble, but the guy you couldn't resist. In this film he is the ultimate bad boy, and Joan Crawford is perfect as the woman who falls for him, and falls hard. Because John Garfield died at such a young age, you may not know who John Garfield is. Take a look at this movie. I think you will be looking for more of his films!"
5,"When it's time to ""be a better friend to yourself,"" read this book","I friend recommended this to me. Now, through understanding the issues associated with drinking this book will help me improve the rest of my life. Buy it, read it and recommend it to others you care about."
3,It's not as bad as the other guys says.,"I've been reading the online version of this book and I am unsure why the original reviewer is so unhappy with it. I'm only on Chapter 3 so far, so I cannot fully judge its contents, but from what I've read it's been very readable and I have learned from it. Is it my favorite book ever? No, but it has not once struck me to be categorized as one of the worst.Read it for yourself:[...]"
2,"Nice Hose Holder, but I got a different color than pictured","I ordered this hose holder because it shows a white one in the picture and that is what I wanted. They ended up sending me a black one which will not look good where I am putting it. Get Organized was great about refunding my money and I didn't have to ship the one I got back to them. Super to deal with. Will buy from them again. Otherwise, quick shipping and the price was great and would have been what I wanted had it been white.***They have since changed the picture on Amazon to show the black one I received."
1,Mandel show in Milwaukee - 10-26-12,"Howie's show this past weekend in Milwaukee was awful. He did not have enough material to last 90 minutes. He talked to the audience all night, never really got into an act. It was bad, everyone has a bad day, this must have been Howie's. Very disappointing."
2,Not Pre-filled as advertised by Shooter's Ridge,"I bought this product from Shooter's Ridge. Stay away from this product because it does not come pre-filled as advertised. I have not been able to use this product yet because I haven't had the time to fill it. First, I have to figure out what to fill it with. Once this is determined (I live in Minnesota with a blanket of snow), then I have to spend considerable time filling it. Don't buy this product."
2,Hard to fill,These things are hard to fill. I thought that they would be filled already. Make sure you have a plan for that.
5,One of S Club's best songs,"Ever since their explosion onto the music scene, S Club have been getting better and better. I love ""Have You Ever"" because it shows true emotion and can touch almost everyone. If you ever let anyone go you can relate to this song. If you loved ""Never had a Dream Come True"" order ""Have you ever"""
4,Good Stuff,"I've tried most of the Myoplex protein powder products (lite, low carb, original) and this one keeps me fuller for a longer period of time. However I think I prefer the original, it doesn't clump up in my blender bottle and tastes a little better. It is a good product however."
1,Waste of Money! Totally Ineffective Product. Buy it only if you want to lose your bike!,"I would strongly advise against wasting money on this. While it is more convenient than a tradional lock in that you don't need to carry around a key, its totally ineffective when it comes to safety. The thieves seem to open this without any problems. Out of 7 bikes in my basement, mine was the only stolen despite being tied to a metal pole (unless others that were locked to flimsy structures)thanks to this!! don't waste your money on this."
1,"They suck , this sucks period, end of story.","Serpents of the light and Scars of the crucifix are the only songs I can tolerate by Deicide. Saw them live the two songs above were the only good ones. They are a joke and Glenns a jerk. AMON AMARTH OR DECAPITATED are reall death metal. Besides that death metal sucsk, unless its melodic, then SOILWORK, DARK TRANQUILITY,INFLAMES,At the GATES , DIMENSION ZERO are all youll ever need. OH yeah and HYPOCRISY."
1,Medicine Chest,"Sorry...I've ordered countless items from Amazon and will continue to do so, but I returned this item because it was built so CHEAPLY...the mirrors were already falling out in front, and the backing was as flimsy as a piece of cardboard...try to mount that to a wall! I'll buy this item at my local hardware store!"
1,Not As Advertised,"This mouse is (at the time of this writing) being advertised as a ""PS/2 Mouse."" It is, in fact, a USB Mouse, without even a PS/2 Adaptor included. It also arrived in a manila envelope with absolutely NO padding, the box battered and torn by the US Postal Service. I'm not going to spend the money to ship this piece of False Advertising back to the seller, but I *AM* going to make amazon.com aware of their scam. I will _NOT_ be shopping with this seller again, and hopefully amazon.com will be more careful of who they allow to set up a stall in their marketplace..."
1,bad bad bad,i love msi dearly but 39 25 second noise blurps c'monthe cd is funny but it [stinks] musicallybut its the best we can do until a new msi cd comes out
4,"Pricey, but worth it","The 20GB HDD that came with my 360 has served me well for the last 3 years, but with the NXE and game installations I've suddenly found its 13GB of usable space extremely limiting. Luckily the 120GB is now going for much less than the $180 that Microsoft was originally asking for it (I paid $125). It's still a lot of money for a 120GB 2.5"" drive (OEM drives go for around $60). Moving from the 20GB drive to the new one was pretty simple (just attach the cable and insert the disk), if not a bit slow (it took me about an hour and a half for the whole process). I doubt I'd consider this a worthwhile upgrade from a newer 60GB drive, but for those with the older 20GB drives or Arcade units it improves the experience greatly."
4,Excellent,"Hard drive plugged right into the 360, and the transfer took about an hour to complete, as my 20 gig drive was nearly full. I did not lose any data during the transfer. I now have a drive with 2 game discs installed and about 80 gigs of free space.It is a shame that you can buy a 500 gig external drive for less money, which is why i gave this 4 stars. It really should be cheaper, but as the only way to improve game performance is to install them to an attached HD, you are stuck."
1,How can you people seriously give this thing a 5?,This is an overprice POS. You should not buy this and show MS that you will not take this financial beating from them. They analyzed this Hard Drive and decided that it costs around 70 dollars to make. THAT IS A 100$ PRICE MARK UP. Stop letting MS tell you what to pay and demand better service.
1,Faulty Advertising,"Don't trust the seller. They seem to employ Chinese Contractors, because I got a knockoff from there that didn't even fit in my Xbox."
3,memory dissapointment,purchased 120gb hard drive and when i installed it to the xbox i was told only 107gb of memory was available feel cheated.
5,Easy transfer of hard drive,Great hard drive. Comes with a transfer kit. Made it so easy transfering 20 gigs to 120 gigs.
5,works perfectly,"i dont think im gonna need a new hard drive for awhile,ive got nhl 10 and u have to create a lot of new players for nhl lineups,but it seems to do so with no problems so far."
3,Tender Victory,"I was certainly disappointed that the book was not as it was represented by the picture, no where near it.It is a first edition, does have a somewhat worn dust jacket but it is acceptable given it's age. There wasno mylar cover on it, however I don't recollect if one was stated or not.I just feel that one should use a correct photograph of the book one is representing, I feel a bit taken in."
2,Deni Vacuum Sealer,"It would have been good if the vacuum would have worked better, but as it is the nozzle is kind of small, vacuum power is not sufficient and if the bag is crinkled on the sealing edge it will not keep the air out after is sealed. As a matter of fact I didn't check better models but this one as it is (not too expensive) it doesn't do a perfect job. But you know how it is: ""You get what you paid for""."
5,An immediately accessible and gripping read.,"I don't normally read historic books, especially to do with the British monarchy. But I'm glad I read this one. Fraser's writing style made the content appealing and enticing. What a fascinating life this Scottish Queen had and what a tragic end she came to. I will look forward to reading other books by this author."
3,"Good, but not great","The clips contain cables well, but the adhesive is a little weak. I ended up having to tack the clips down with small nails to hold them in place."
5,Amazing Martial Arts Film! Chinese v. Japanese!,"I'm not a man of many words, so I don't think I'll say too much. But not enough can be said about this awesome martial arts flick! First of all, it stars Gordon Liu, whose martial arts career rivals that of Jackie Chan. Second it is a fantanstic display of the differences between Chinese and Japanese martial arts. It's got jian (straight sword) versus katana, butterfly swords versus sai, karate versus zui quan (drunken fist), and an awesome confrontation between Chinese kung fu and ninja!Some might call the plot weak, but I've seen weaker. Besides, it's usually not about the plot, but the kung fu fights, in which case this film is excellent."
2,"Nice display, but terrible radio","Quite near-sighted, I enjoy the large display especially at night when not wearing my glasses. However, the radio reception stinks on this unit. It can't pick up local stations that I used to get on the 10 year clock I had previously."
4,It's a clock,"The display on this thing is great, very clear and large enough to see from anywhere. The radio isn't the best but big deal it's a clock radio! The alarm buttons are more difficult to get to than on an average alarm clock making it an effectie wake up system seeing as it's difficult to turn the alarm off when you're drowsy. As an alarm clock it works great."
3,Goldilocks Returns,"Goldilocks Returns was the sequel to the famous fairytale Goldilocks and the Three Bears. The sequel was al about how Goldilocks felt so bad about what she did that she changed her name and opened a lock service. One day it got too much for her that she decided to pay the three Bears a visit. When she goes to the three Bears houses there was no one there, yet she went in anyway. She immediately started fixing everything that she made wrong, but she went a little too far. I recommend this book because it was fun to read about what happened to the beloved fairytale character. It also teaches you to be careful what you do cause you might regret it, which is all lesson all ages need to learn so I recommend it for everyone."
5,Goldilocks Returns,This book is a new take on an old classic. Children who are familiar with the original get the joke when Goldilocks returns and upsets the bears routine again. Funny.
2,A self absorbed account of adoption,"As an adoptive mother, I read this book looking for some insight into the mind of a birth mother. I had regular conversation with my child's birth mother before and after he was born. But I found the author's notion of the Primal Wound offensive. It was if she placed herself above whatever had been given to the child she placed for adoption by his parents. Its great that she could find her son and establish a relationship with him. I kept having to remind myself that she was a birth mother who apparently had to justify giving her child up for adoption by placing herself foremost in his life. It was insightful if only for that, but otherwise a total waste of time compared to less self absorbed books written by birth parents, adoptees and adoptive parents."
3,It's cheese cloth,"Used it for pressing cider.Went down to brewery store and got brewers socks instead.Nothing wrong with it, just not cut out for what I was using them for"
4,This is huge.,"I'm worried about larger tuperware not fitting in it properly, but all in all a very good buy. Lots of compartments."
5,Best pen ever!,"I write very small and this pen is unbelievably smooth, precise, and clear. Everyone who borrows it loves it, and I have to chain them down. I can't believe these are actually pretty hard to find, but I'm glad to see it here."
5,Best pens ever,"Liek a micro point? .38, gel, smooth tip, clean, sharp writingI carry these every where I go - best ever"
5,Very nice pen - smaller point than regular pens,"I purchased this specially because is smaller point that regulars pens. 0.38very nice product, I can't find it at any local store."
3,GPX C3860,"I bought the C3860 for about $. After opening it, I found out the cheap headphones don't even work correctly, but the CD-Player is a pretty good deal (if you plan to go outdoors with this thing, spend the extra $$$ on the anti-shock model). If you plan to get this model, get (I recommend) a Sony MDR-101 headphones and some long-lasting batteries (this CD-Player eats batteries like crazy!). Unlike some other reviews, this CD-Player never broke down on me before. If you are going to buy this model, think about it first. I spent almost $ on headphones and batteries alone!"
2,Look somewhere else!,"After I used this product I found that it worked fairly good. I read in the ingredients that it has pumice aggregate, which is ground pumice. Your skin is delicate, ground pumice shouldn't be used on your face. It has made my skin burn a bit and feel quite sensitive. I wouldn't recommend this product. Although my skin feels smooth, it seems to have damaged my skin. I gave it two stars only because it does what it claims."
2,Googman's not so goodest,"I love Steve Goodman. His version of City of New Orleans was the original and the best. The work with Jethro Burns is beautiful and enough sound and harmony to epitomize Goodman's strengths. OK the version of the Dutchman is a keeper but the rest of the ""studio production"" stuff is way over produced and sounds like the era it was produced in. I am a fan of re-mastering material if it makes it sound better but if the old style reverb still sounds like singing into an empty dumpster then why bother. Let well enough alone and savor the CD versions of the LP's in the most recent release you can Find. Some things shouldn't be released or re-leased.Steve Rest in Peace"
3,Music Fan in Michigan,"Flawless technical playing but musically unimaginative performances seriously detract form this recording. It is unfortunate that these obviously fine concertos sound like finger dexterity excercises in the hands of Mr. Leister. He uses absolutely metronome tempi, no tonal colors, no vibrato, or anything else to distinguish himself from a computer. The accuracy he displays within his own self-imposed strictness is impressive, however. It's by no means a bad recording, but after a listening one would beg for some flexibility and virtuosty in the style of violinists, which by the way, is the stlye of the concertos generally.Reccomended with reservation."
2,Too expensive for what you're getting,"I bought the 75W-90 for my W56 manual transmission in my 1987 Toyota Pickup a long time ago. At first nothing much changed, then it got harder to shift into first and reverse gears. I soon sold the truck to my cousin, cause I had bought a Tacoma and needed the money. Apparently my cousin, had to change out the transmission, cause he was complaining he was ""losing gears"".From what I've heard from other Toyota 4x4 enthusiasts, the synchronizers in the transmission require some friction in order for you to engage into whatever gear you're wanting. Seems that Royal Purple's gear oil is a little too slick for at least, a Toyota transmission.I've now got a 1987 Toyota 4Runner and I'm going to spend my money on Redline's MT-90 gear oil, since I've heard so many good things about it from other Toyota enthusiasts."
5,Royal Purple Oil,"Great product. Transmission runs a whole lot smoother, and the power transfer to the wheels is greatly noticed. Recommend to anyone that wants to get a little more out of there trans. plus the dealer had the best price around, beats even local part stores."
4,A must for any southern rock fan,A true southern rock classic! These guys show off some blazing guitar work as well as a rather raw vocal harmony. Tunes range from a bluesy sound to straight forward boogie. If you are a fan of southern rock and plan ol' back porch pickin'. This C.D. is for you.
2,For advanced cooks ONLY!,"I bought this book thinking it'd be for layman/ beginners in cooking. I was wrong. The meals are so extravagant, my head was spinning.Don't get me wrong, I'm sure these recipes will cook the pants off ANY female. But if you have little to no experience in the kitchen beforehand, this book is not for you.ALSO, this book has hardly any meals w/ MEAT in it. I'd would venture that at least 85% of all the recipes in this book (not including dessert) are SEAFOOD. For those of us out there that do not like seafood, stay away from the book."
3,Lee Greenwood Live,"I thought the concert was a little campy considering the stature of Lee Greenwood. The location and staging were like that of a music hall at one of the many ""period"" theme parks that scatter the U.S. I would only recommend this concert to serious fans of Mr. Greenwood."
4,omega complex,well let me begin by saying that this pills are great taste neutral and they do what they are supp to do
3,Frustratingly Out of Date,"Wonderfully written, but horribly out of date. Fagan clings to the Clovis-first theory in this book, and I thought I bought the revised version! It is well-accepted in archaeology that the Clovis were not the first Americans. The Bering Land Bridge (Beringia) is no longer thought to be the only route the first settlers took.Pick up a book written more recently than 1987 (the original publication date of The Great Journey) and you will get a completely different story of the peopling of the Americas.I am currently reading Entering American: Northeast Asia and Beringia Before the Last Glacial Maximum edited by D.B. Madsen. It's a pretty dense book on the subject, but extremely information rich. It was published in 2004- the same year as the so-called revised edition of The Great Journey."
5,Life transforming,"A book that changed my life. I have met the authors a few years after reading this incredible book, and having known them now for quite a few years, I can honestly say they walk their talk. This book is about love, unconditional love, and the power of that love. It's about realizing who we are as children of God. The angels are real, I have experienced their love, and they are here to help humanity, but they won't do it for us. They want us to fully realize our magnificence as children of God. The angels are still working with the authors and those willing to open their hearts and step into their power and bring heaven to Earth.A very life-transforming book that will enlighten the deepest and darkest crevices of your soul. You will never be the same person after you finish reading it. The beauty of the messages is that it matters not what your beliefs are, the message of love is for all people. Are you ready to see and experience your magnificence?dw"
4,Book for College studetns and refrence,"While the book contains a good view of British History, it is a very dry read. I used this book in a class on early British history and found it an excellent background source book, but not for the casual reader. One stunning aspect that the book contains that many do not is a section on pre-roman Britain. Most books start British History at the arivals of the Romans in Britain, yet this one gives a good account of the Beaker folk, those who built Stonehenge, and the rest of early England. I've tried to use this as a refrence book and have found it somewhat difficult to easily flip to sections that contained focused and collected information, but I do reconment it to those who need a better background to English history and events."
4,Good...,This product was of good quality and was easy to install. It isn't something I would expect to last a lifetime (quality wise) but maybe 5-7 years. The price was about 30% of what OEM parts would be. Well worth the cost. A good buy!
3,larry,"I love Larry, but this wasn't his funniest. If your a Larry fan, it's worth seeing, but I know Larry and have seen better!!!!!"
1,It deserves zero stars......,"It's really like an accident you don't want to see but can't seem to stop looking. This is a book I didn't want to keep reading but couldn't stop......Ugh. Flat cardboard characters. Spineless heroine. WHY oh WHY doesn't she stand up to her manipulative, shallow mother & the dictatorial professor? And how can she be in a PhD program when she's this dense?The image obsessed mother. The father who spouts quotations. The abusive boss from hell. Cliche after cliche.....You can see the plot hiccups (I can't really call them twists) coming a mile away. The plot is propelled by simple misunderstandings and overheard conversations. In other words, there is no real plot.There are so many wonderful romantic women's fiction books out there. This isn't one of them."
2,Broken packaging,"When I received this product, the plastic covering the perfume cardboard box was broken. Besides, the cardboard box had many parts that seemed to be cut off (as when you try to take off the price or the serial number). I am not sure why. The other point is that the smell goes really quick, I have seen some comments posting the same. I am really concerned, because this characteristics are found in fake perfumes. And the seller was AMAZON, not any small online seller."
4,Songs of a Forgotten Master,"Spohr's music features lyrical melodies and chromatic harmonies within the framework of classical forms. Most of these songs are strophic (verse form). The obbligato instruments in opus 103 (clarinet) and opus 154 (violin) add a warm color by often depicting an aspect of the text (song 2, opus 103, the clarinet is a bird): these are duets accompanied by piano. Fischer-Dieskau and Varady deliver marvelous interpretations of the text. Unfortunately, even Fischer-Dieskau cannot rescue a few of the songs from their repetative verse form. Overall, this recording is a wonderful addition to any vocal chamber music collection."
4,A book that you can't help loving,"I recently read this masterpiece of literature and it was toooottttaaaallllyyyy fascinating!!! it really makes you realise how many people died in those wars and it shows that wars should be prevented in the future. I really enjoyed it, and i can definitely reccomend it to you and everyone else who enjoys historical fiction."
2,Not a workout,"The previous review led me to believe that this was a dance workout dvd. It is NOT. It's a series of performances cut from an Iranian television show. Some of the routines have a folk dance flair to them, some more belly dance-like, and one performance attempts an American flair. It was the first time I'd seen a male belly dancer - complete with beaded fringe belt and fringed shirt. For the most part, the performances are on the level of the old variety shows - just entertainment. I kept expecting Ed Sullivan or Lawrence Welk to walk out. At this price, I took a chance - I gave it two stars because I was interested in the costumes."
5,"educational, engaging puppy toy","My daughter loves this puppy! She received this as a Christmas gift last year and it goes practically everywhere with her. The buttons are easily triggered, giving her a response every time she touches it. She enjoys the songs and interaction and dances to the music. The down side is that the silly thing goes off at the oddest times, like late at night when the cat mistakenly jumps on it. The songs get a little annoying after a while, but it is difficult to find a toy where that ISN'T the case. All in all, she loves it, has learned from it, and we will continue to tolerate the annoying songs for her sake."
5,Excellent learning toy,"This has been one of the excellent learning-cum-fun toys of all that my eight month old son ever played with. It has different modes. The music mode plays melodious songs and poems. Also plays the ABCs song.The learning mode teaches colors, body parts etc. Overall this is a great toy,whenever I would sing those songs he would relate with them so well as he would just not stop laughing and giggling. Really rewarding..."
2,They Should Make the on/off Switch in a Different Spot!,"My 8 month old daughter received this toy from my friend for Christmas. It's overall educational learning experience is okay. I like how you press the foot/hand/tummy/ear and it will say what you are pressing. However, what makes this toy so annoying & frustrating for both baby & me is the fact that the of/off button is on one of the feet and it's sooooooo extremely sensitive that if you barely touch it, it will switch modes or turn off! This is why I give this toy 2 stars. If they had the on/off button in the back, where it should be, it would be an excellent toy. The songs are great and the voice is cheerful and friendly. I really want to love this toy but the fact that they made the on/off switch in such a ridiculous spot makes me want to flush it down the toilet!"
4,very cute,this puppy is very cute and my son loves to play with it. withing 4months of having it an ear and a foot had quit working. so not too durable.
3,"Good toy, but my son just isn't interested","My son got this puppy as a gift 4 months ago. There are buttons in both feet, in one hand, in the nose and one ear that are very sensitive to touch and easy for even a young child to operate. The button in the tummy is under some stuffing so you have to press harder and it's difficult for my son who's now one year old to find it. Overall I think it's a good toy. It has a ""learning"" mode where it describes body parts and colors (e.g. green hand, red nose). It has a ""sing and play games"" mode where it sings familiar songs like Heads and Shoulders Knees and Toes. I like how it sings the entire song as opposed to some toys that only give a short snippet. Unfortunately, my son just doesn't have much interest in it. He never plays with it for more than a few minutes. Otherwise, I'd give it a higher rating."
2,ADHD Doggie,"OK - this toy is cute and my daughter seems to like it - but, it has a hair trigger on some features and it is impossible to get it to work on others. When it does work, my daughter loves it, squealing and dancing along to the songs. But, often it changes in the middle of a song - one of the feet usually triggering a change and she looks at me like ""What happened?"" Of course, she forgets and goes along with it but it drives me and my husband crazy. The hands are impossible for an adult, much less an infant. This toy would be great with some major improvements."
3,ard to maintain attention,"This is an incredibly cute toy. My 2 yr old got it as a present at 18 months and thinks it's very cute, but it doesn't hold his interest very long. My major beef with it's too easy to press a body part by hugging it or moving it around. For toddlers who like to touch and move things and not just sit, watch, and listen until a song is over, it's a problem. You press its paw, it sings, and then when your toddler ends up hugging it, or wanting to play with it in different ways, he activates other body parts. So you basically never get to hear an entire song all the way through unless you insist that your toddler move away from the doll to listen to it first."
4,he loves it.,Noy only does it have some fun songs but I have yet to change the batteries (4 months later).
3,The ear broke...,My son started playing with this when he was about 5 months. It was his favorite! After a couple of months the ear stopped working. He was pretty rough on it though. He always hung on to it by the ear. Then about a month ago the whole right side of the toy stopped working. It feels like wires were disconnected but there is no way to get to them to reattach. Even though it's broken he still plays with it.
5,Christmas gift 2011,"My infant grandson loved this dog, he plays with it all the time, very entertaining and educational, would recommend this to anyone with a small child"
1,Be aware! The old version doesn't have the dog bone light!,"I returned the toy. The dog bone collar which can lights up to the music on the toy I received is missing! I checked the picture on the outside package, there is none. But on the website description and the web picture, it shows the dog bone collar. The toy I received must be a OLD version!!!! I am not satisfied to be given an out-dated version.In addition, the toy had already made songs inside the crate before I opened it. It had been singing along during the shipment. When I opened the box, the battery strip to prevent the battery to be used up had been already removed.The puppy dogs songs can only sing to one sentence then switch to other songs. I felt something wrong with this unit."
5,"Great Toy, Educational and Fun","This is a great puppy toy, my son loves him and also loves Tad the frong by imaginarium. Tad has the same consept that this great toy does. I hope they make more educational and fun soft animal toys like this one.One lady gave an only poor rating to this toy and said it only played half way. Well, that's because she didn't pull the tab all the way. If parents do not know how to play with the toy how would children enjoy them;) All of these puppies play songs, alphabet etc half way until you pull the tab."
2,boring,"My daughter got this toy when she was 9 months old. She has never looked the side it was on. Its kind of boring. However, my daughter has lots of toys so this one may be overlooked. She and I would rather have the money spent on a different toy."
3,The jury is still out...,"I ordered this as a gift and it sat on my bookcase for about a month before being wrapped. The puppy was firmly attached to the display box and I did not disturb the packaging. Every so often it would start talking throughout the day (and night). No matter what I did to try and shut it off, it just had a mind of its' own."
2,Kind of disappointed,"I bought this for my daughter when she was around 18 months. She was interested in it at first, but her attention soon wavered. I want to add that I have a high tolerance for annoying toys, but this is one was too annoying for me! It would go off randomly, even after I had turned it off. She was much more interested in the Leapfrog Violet Dog doll than this one."
1,Laugh&Learn Puppy toys (2 purchased),"I purchased two of these Fisher-Price Laugh & Learn Puppy toys on October 23, 2011 for my two grand-sons for Christmas. Neither one of these worked, even after checking the batteries. Unfortunately, per Amazon's return policy, I cannot return these for a refund (or store credit) since I ordered them more than 30 days ago. Needless to say, I was a very disappointed Grandparent on Christmas Day.Fisher-Price Laugh & Learn Learning Puppy"
3,On/Off Button Error,"I love the concept of this puppy!! However, I have found that the left foot that has the on/off button much to easy to push! If my 8month old son taps the foot at all it switches modes and ultimately turns off! It is soo annoying because I'm sure I have not heard the end of most the songs! The puppy starts singing and then I hear ""bye-bye""! If it were not for this error, I would give this puppy 5 stars! It really is a pain that he can not fully enjoy the Laugh and Learn Puppy! I felt stupid for not checking reviews first, but haven't seen as many pointing out this problem!"
1,Don't be sucked in by its cuteness,"I bought this laugh & learn puppy because it is so adorable and I thought my son would love it. I was wrong when I gave my son his new toy he wanted nothing to do with it. He crawls right past it and has not acknowledged this toy once. The toy is way to sensitive the slightest touch and the puppy is cutting in and out of songs or saying bye bye because you slightly touched the on/off button. This toy could have been alot better. Save your money, skip this toy and buy something that is actually educational."
2,Very Nice,"***Revised review***I could not adjust the rating, but would now give it 4 stars. Thanks to an email from another Amazon shopper, this toy was saved from the trash heap. I had not noticed the plastic tab that had to be pulled from the back of the toy to get it out of demo mode. Once that's removed, it works great. The quality of the sounds and songs are very pleasant and cheerful. Some of the pressure points are still difficult for my 11-month old to find and manipulate."
4,Fisher Price Laugh & Learn Puppy,"We bought this toy for my 7 month old daughter. It sings many songs, identifies some of the body parts, and a few colors. My daughter seems to like it. I think the sound on it is a bit too loud, but otherwise it is a good toy."
5,Very impressed with this learning toy!!!,"My daughter has the ""other"" popular stuffed dog toy that claims to be interactive with the use of the computer. Between the two... Fisher Price Laugh and Learn Puppy is hands down much more educational. So, this toy does not say your child's name but it does teach much more than the other competitor stuffed dog. This toy teaches the names of body parts, colors, numbers, the alphabet, and classic toddler songs and rhymes. Fisher Price this toy is a winner!!!"
4,Creepy toy,"My daughter got this toy for her first birthday. She's only played with it a few times because it doesn't keep her attention. The sensors in the paws are sooo sensitive that she would be playing with it while it was singing to her and then she'd bump a paw and it would start doing something else. Too many abrupt changes would leave her unsatisfied with the toy. I say this toy is creepy because it goes off in the middle of the night and has scared me to death. Waking up to hearing ""PEEKABOO, I see you!"" is not fun. It goes off all the time when no one is touching it. I've had to turn it off and keep it off. If you want to get this toy for a kid whose parents you'd like to scare, then I highly suggest it."
1,Spastic Dog,"My son got this toy for Christmas. It is cute to look at and that is about it. It is not helpful for education in any sense because it never finishes a song or rhyme because the buttons are too sensitive, instead it ends up speaking in a garbled mess.Be sure to take out the batteries at night, because it talks for no reason and has woke my son. Not to mention it is creepy enough to usually say ""peek a boo, I see you"" at 3 o'clock in the morning.My son does enjoy it though, makes him smile and laugh (4mos) but it will be useless to teach him anything with it. There are MUCH better toys out there. You are better just to stick to classic battery-less toys and help make the fun yourself."
4,Good toy for the money,"This toy was purchased for a 6 month old child. It has lots of fun songs and states the various body parts when pressed. I think my child may get more interested in it as she gets older. However, for the money it is a good little toy to take in the car and keep her entertained a while."
4,What A Cool Toy!,"I got this as a gift for my friend's baby shower and it got a great reception. Another mom there raved about it and said it was her baby's favorite toy. When it first arrived to my house, I tried it out and it is very easy to operate because the triggers are so sensitive. The hands, feet, ears and stomach all have those senors to make it activate. I can easily see how a baby as young as 5 months could swing its arm or leg at it and it will go on."
2,possessed puppy,The puppy has great potential if it works properly. Ours was ultra-sensitive and was constantly going off. You could not even listen to a song all the way through because it would constantly act as if you were pressing the on/off button. I tried new batteries but that did not help. I think I just got a bad one.
1,Unhappy with Puppy,"Myself and a relative purchased the Puppy as a gift for my son this Charistmas. After both sets of batteries were replaced and the tags pulled off, the toy still didn't work. Do not waste your money on this gift."
2,We hate it but our kid likes it,"My mother-in-law gave this to my son when he was 6 months. He is now 10 months. I hate this toy. I hate the stupid voice, the stupid songs it sings, I hate how sensitive the buttons are, I hate its stupid insipid face and its stupid purple shirt.But...my kid loves it. So it stays for now. I long for the day when he outgrows it so that I don't hear ""It's a great big colorful world out there, everything has a color that it can share..."" (I mean come on, what does that even mean?) Ear. Blue ear. Got my toes! Tummy! That tickles! *twitch*My other complaints are that the velcro doesn't stay fastened in the back and the surface has begun to pill pretty badly."
2,Laugh & Learn Puppy,"We bought our daughter this toy for her first Christmas. She was only a month old when she got it, but we anticipated she'd grow into it. Now at 10 months she is just starting to play with it. It has not stood the test of time however, the ear button and the one hand button no longer work. Out of six music and learning sites 2 have quit working. Surprisingly, because it really hasn't been used hardly at all. She still pushes the other limbs to make the sounds but it gets very anoying because it says the same song or phrase over and over because of this. It is not one of her favorites so I'm thankful for that. I wouldn't recommend this toy just for the fact it isn't durable."
4,Diamond in the rough,"On a hope I purchased 3 of these little wonders just after christmas. One has gone by way of an irresponsible child, but the other 2 are fine. There are pro's and con's to them though. First, I must say that for the price, it's a bargain. I recommend that additional accessories are purchased for this product. New quality headphones, I use the fold-up model that radio Shack sells. A carrying pouch, the belt clip is bound to fail. What I like best about this unit is fidelity and output power. These units deliver a vibrant full range sound that rivals others many times the cost. These actually drive the headphones louder with less distortion than all but a very few personal, two cell powered units that I have heard. By utilizing the headphone wire as an antenna, radio reception is very commendable. I do regret that lack of stereo from the FM tuner but the fidelity and output power compensates for it well."
5,Great Book,"I would recommend this book to any African Cichlid fan . Great info , nice pictures . I bought this for myself but would be a great gift to any Cichlid fan"
4,A very good book on the CFL,"First of all, Mr O'Brien's book is truly informative about the last couple of decades of the CFL's long history. Thus, if you are familiar with the league's early years, the text supplies an excellent (though sometimes ""heavy"" in details) history of the venerable Canadian institution. Quite a few questions and hypotheses about the social and national elements associated with the sport are offered always in an intelligent and well documented manner. It is unfortunate a prequel book (especially for the years following WWII up to Mr O'Brien's study) does not exist although the author includes a condensed history of the sport in the first chapters.However, it would have been nice if a number of pictures had been included in the book. I suspect marketing/price reasons must have prevented the author to do so.I highly recommend the book and hope that much more titles regarding the CFL would be available."
4,Save the children,"Something odd is happening to Anji, causing her to become telepathic, so the Doctor lands the TARDIS on the planet of Ceres Alpha to look for a cure. This planet is being settled by humans, but there have been some very odd children born...A rather dark book, with hints at the worst aspects of eugenics, it at the same time manages to be rather touching. The struggles of not only the TARDIS crew but also the parents of one of the mutant children against the planetary government focus in on the inhumanity of which humans are capable.Exactly how the situation arose is the central mystery to the book, and its slow unfolding is the central driving force of the novel's latter narrative.This is Steve Emmerson's second Doctor Who novel, and confirms that his first was not just a flash in the pan."
5,One of mine and my daughter's favorite movie...,"I got this for my 2 year old daughter, who has been watching this in VHS 24/7...so I thought it would be nice to upgrade the movie to DVD for her.She loves the movie, and watches it 24/7...it could get boring, but everytime she plays it, you can't help to but watch it. Its such a good movie with great story line...and yes, I do get teary eyed watching the movie."
2,Lo peor en mucho tiempo...,"Los fans de Yuridia podran decir que este album es un joya o el mejor, pero hay que hablar claro. Este album es uno de los peores disco del a~o pasado en la musica latina. No hay duda alguna que Yuridia tiene una gran voz. Eso no es punto de discussion. Pero hay que ser honestos, este album parece que lo hicieron en uno o dos dias. Son los covers mas horibles que he escuchado. No puedo creer como masacro la cancion de The Police. No hay nada rescatable. Solo hizo este disco por hacerlo. No tiene alma. No tiene feeling. No tiene corazon. Esta nulo."
4,Nice big fat pen.,"My second favorite line of disposable pen. My favorite is a tie between the Stanford Uni-ball vision and Pilot's Vball. This pen is more expensive since it uses a gel ink, which I think was first maded by Papermate. Gel is remarkably smoother then the normal Uni-ball Vision ink and much better then normal dry ink. It doesn't blend as much as the Vision's ink.What makes gel a little less forgiving is it run out a lot faster then any other type of inks. Plus the gel head sizes are on the average larger then the other pen tips. Again it cost more and when you write it tends to be a little slower (combination of tip size and gel sickliness) then my favorite the Vision or Vball ink.Overall, if you want the smoothest ink for writing very clear and big notes, look no further."
2,"Quick dry, Quicker chipper peeling","I purchased this because I was looking for a topcoat that would dry quickly and not cause my polish to chip as easily. This top coat certainly dried fast, but it peeled terribly! When using this I could peel the entire nail of polish off in one strip."
3,Novel in history text form,"Now starts the listing of events and names and places. The first book was building a foundation for the readers. Now Colleen McCullough is going to tell us a story. Tell, not show. I don't mind because I am use to the history books. I love reading history. But many people, looking for a novel, with events and grand gestures and showing us what happens, instead of giving us rumors and letters and exchanges between people who witnesses something. This is a novel in history text form.Caesar, he would everybody knows from their history or English classes, finally shows up. As a child, true, but he is here."
5,Great book,"This is a great book, and part of a great series by Colleen McCullough. If you like historical novels, this book is for you."
5,Use as a text book,"This book is the book that when wanting to learn about NLP this is the text book to learn. If you have never done anything in NLP I suggest that you take some litter material about the topic before you pick up this book. This book is in depth and the heart of NLP. Get the second volume too, as this one covers meta data with language, where the second book expands on it and helps you understand it better."
1,hair therapy,"After a couple of weeks of using this product, I began to get a headache each time I put it on. I saw no change in my hair during the time I used it. I returned it, and am waiting for a refund."
5,Wonderful Pancakes!,This mix makes wonderful gluten free pancakes. Use milk instead of water and add a few drops of vanilla and some cinnamon. My family loves them!
5,"great mix, great price","This is a great baking mix at a great price. For around $3 a pound, you will receive the most perfect gluten free baking mix that works with any recipe. This mix makes the most perfect pancakes ever. My family likes them better than regular pancakes (they can't even tall the difference). This mix makes great scones, muffins, biscuits, crusts, cookies, etc. I store my mix in an airtight container and the other two bags in the freezer until I use them. They seem to go really quickly around here. With this mix, it is so much easier to be that perfect baker you have always wanted to be without all the hassle. My mom also needs to eat GF and she used to make her own baking mix from scratch. Her mix not only took more time to make, but it was actually more costly than this mix. After she tried Pamela's mix, she stopped making her own and switched over."
2,Where are the ingredients listed?,I tried reading all the information on this before I bought it to find out what the ingredients are. I need a product that is also dairy free and I did not find that any where so I bought it. Lo and Behold it contains Buttermilk. Beware anyone allergic to dairy products!!!!
4,Wonderful product,I dont eat too many of these myself but my family loves it when I make these. It makes great waffles and pancakes. My firends who don't need a gluten-free product even seem to really like it. I wouldn't buy anything else!! This is a wonderful product.
5,My main knife,"I've been using this knife for about 4 years now, it's had a tough life, it's killed snakes, been used for fishing and I also used it as my work knife for a little over 2 years cutting cardboard, which as you might know, usually dulls the blade quite quickly, but this one holds a good edge and rarely requires sharpening. The only thing I can really pick on is the round decorative thing with ""Gerber"" written on it spins around on mine which I don't really like but it doesn't affect the performance of the knife. Despite this, though, if I ever lost it, I would get another one."
3,Not as good...,"I love all things Alice Hoffman. This story was fine, but not quite up to par with her other works. It was a good read, but she's done some phenomenal things, so she has a lot to live up to."
4,Richly written,"Hoffman never disappoints. The characters are real, and I found myself spellbound and laughing at parts, near tears at others. I couldn't wait to see what happened to the giant and the old woman who couldn't fly. I love how she handled the tryst and really didn't tie up all the loose ends so my imagination can keep these folks going.And she crafts her prose with such a bare-bones command of the language that it's a joy to read. No extra fluff, no adverbs in the way. She just goes right at it with amazing skill that must be the combination of a supernatural gift and years of honing her talent."
2,illumination night,I did not like the story. It left blanks as far as the characters' interations with one another. Not enough detail in realtionships. Story ended with the reader looking for a different ending.
3,durable & reliable,"I needed a karaoke machine for my 7 yr old daughters birthday party. It made it through a night with 15 girls it should last a life time!! I like that it had the dual cassettes, cd & the best part was that it displayed the words on the tv. I recommended this item to my sister, cousins ,aunts etc! Its an excellent karaoke machine for beginners."
3,Be Careful -- This May Be More Than You Want,"An overview of centuries of ethnic and dynastic controversy. No Balkan history can be a page-turner but this one is quite readable. It is, however, a work of history, not of politics or political science or current events. Those wanting to learn a lot of history about an obscure part of the world will be satisfied; those wanting simply a background to understand current events will be mystified."
1,worthles...,"In his Kosovo; A Short History, Mr. Malcolm fails to explain how over 200 historic churches, monasteries and other holy sites dating back a thousand years happen to be in Kosovo. Are the Serbian claims to Kosovo any less than the claims of European Jews to Israel some 2000 years after they left? Serbian claims to Kosovo are much stronger than Croatian claims to Krajina. And how many states' territorial integrity would remain intact, if Noel Malcolm's one-sided quasi-historical research religious intolerance were applied elsewhere in the world?"
5,very pleased,"I am quite happy with this pedometer. It is accurate and I like the fact that I can review previous days steps. Using a pedometer is a great motivator to try and reach my 10,000 steps/day goal."
2,If it's defective...,"...don't expect Omron to act respectably. Mine stopped counting steps after three weeks of use. To get a replacement, you must call for a return authorization and address (this info is not in the manual), and then you learn that they demand $5 for 'shipping and handling' this 1 ounce item, which is on top of your cost to return it. At least in my case they first try to induce you to buy a new battery, telling you that it only comes with a 'trial battery,' although the manual again says no such thing and this web page says the battery should last a year. All in all, this company is sleazy, so you'd better hope that your item doesn't fail."
1,Poor product and even worse service,"I ordered 2 pedometers. One works fine, but the second one does not recognize the actual number of steps taken. As my husband and I wore the pedometers on a walk, the bad one recorded 1/10 the expected number of steps. When I called Omron to complain, I expected a replacement. Instead, she wanted me to mail it to their service department so they could evaulate it. $8.00 shipping each way. When I explained that would cost more than the pedometer, she suggested replacing the battery even though the serial number of the pedometer showed it to be only 6 months old. Tough luck!"
5,Great pedometers if they would last,"These pedometers are great. Very efficient and simple. If you just want to keep track of your straps without any fancy extra's than this is the BEST pedometer. However, they don't last long. my third one just broke and it was purchased 4 months ago......"
5,Perfect,This is being used in conjunction with a diabetic diet to see if my diabetic husband has to use the treadmill at night. It works great
2,For Walkers Only,"This little pedometer seems to work fine if you are interested in taking a walk that is continuous. It only starts registering steps after you've taken four. I work and it's a couple of steps over here (doesn't read them) 10 steps there (this it reads) and so on. I need to find one that registers more then steps only after you've taken four. Sure if I walk around the floor but I want the small groups registered also; so, I only gave it two stars because it's not right for me."
3,doesn't stay attached to you!,"When it works, this pedometer is great. It really doesn't stay on your pants as well as it should and once it hits the ground, it is dead. Even a new battery doesn't revive it. So it is really disappointing when that happens."
5,Like it!,"This pedometer is super easy to use. Even when I haven't used it in a long time I can slip it on and it works right away. There is no resetting it, it holds time and changes days automatically. It has a seven day memory so you can flip back and see what you've done in the last week."
1,Never worked. Waste of money...,Big waste of money for me. I was so looking forward to getting it... but guess what???? either something wrong w the battery or the whole thing...
2,"Simple and easy to use, but unreliable","I purchased this model over a year ago and the first one stopped functioning after two or three months. I received a replacement from Omron (they wanted to collect a ""shipping and handling"" charge that was almost the the same as the price of a new one, but I refused to pay it). The replacement worked for a few months, and then it stopped working too. The screen worked, the low battery indicator was not activated, but it just stopped counting steps.I like the concept of a pedometer and this model is simple and easy to use, with a clear display and easy scrolling of step counts for the past seven days, but if you want a product that will last, I suggest you avoid this model and perhaps avoid Omron entirely, as I expect most of their models use the same basic design."
3,works. clip is uncomfortable and falls off easily,i like it for its simple number display and automatic reset at midnight. and i like that it has a clip but back of clip protrudes into your waist. hurts! cant drive wtih it on as seat belt pokes it into your skin further. cant sit with it as it's pushed to fall off. and every time you take down your pants to go the bathroom it falls off onto dirty restroom floors or toilet. yuck! or you risk losing it if you didnt notice it fell. they should make the clip tighter and able to be clipped anywhere on fabric other than waist. but its ok clipped on just while exercising. just not a good one to count all day steps and who really needs to do that except for fun?
5,Great memory!,"As advertised. I installed it and my computer came to life. I have Vista installed and it was very sluggish with 1mg. After installing the Crucial, 2 1mg bars, it flys! Fast shipper and good product!"
4,Exelent return policy,"When I ordered this item it was defective. That being said amazon has one of the best return polcies on the web. fileing the return merchandis form online was very easy and took less than 2 min. Amazon paid the shipping for the return of the defective item and the shipping of the replacement item. I was able to print out a postage paid return label for the return shipping on the defective item, so i didnt have to wait to be reimbursed. The replacement item worked fine. :)"
5,excellent filters,"The local store where we customarily bought these filters closed, so we ordered them online. They're exactly the same filters and now we have a year's supply."
4,Compelling,"This book is compelling and heartrending. Such a good read and at times you may feel sorry for the girl who is, after all, a child, though this is certainly not presented as an excuse for such a terrifying crime. Very Good and would advise anyone to read, but please note that it is explicit and graphic in some sections."
5,A First Look at Louis Armstrong,"I am a music teacher in an elementary school where there are many cultures represented. I wanted to add to my collection of stories for children, using February and Black History Month as the backdrop and music as the subject matter. One of the books that met this need was ""If I Only Had a Horn: Young Louis Armstrong"". The book sheds light on the hardships Louis had as a child and his love of music. It is candid in telling why he was sent to a boy's home (without getting too serious) and how he had to learn patience to earn his horn. The pictures are expressive and my students thoroughly enjoyed the story. I added some recordings to complete the lesson, especially ""Dippermouth Blues"" which gets it's name from a nickname of his as a child; and that is mentioned in the book. I used this for grades 3-5 and my students enjoyed it, learned about Louis as a boy and how he overcame many troubles for the love of his music. It is a welcome addition to my children's collection."
2,Digital and Analog Communication Systems,"This book is not clearly written. The discussion on Fourier and other math topics is a review, but if you knew those topics before you will be confused by the time you finish. There is often too little information in the text to answer the questions at the end of the chapter."
1,Warning: Bad book,"This is the worst book I was every forced to buy for my undergraduate degree. Bad examples, bad questions, just a very poor book. The idea of the class is good, but the way the information is presented is awful and you do not learn anything. The book assumes you know everything about circuits because it doesn't explain anything. Trust me VERY VERY BAD book from learning prospective."
1,wrong disc,"The songs listed are by the Records, a new wave band from the 70's, not the Kursaal flyers."
3,Splendors of Ottoman Sultans: Museum tour,"Had the VHS transferred to DVD, disappointed in the quality of the picture. Content is good, just wish the pictures were clearer."
4,Good toy,Our puppy enjoys the toy. The toy is long enough to play with the puppy without her accidently biting our fingers.
2,"fuzzy, yellow, and not cute","I bought this for my cavalier after watching the Petsmart commercial. I understand it is not the same toy, but it bears some resemblence. It came in a dreadful yellow color and was not extremely well made. It was a soft, somewhat cottony/furry texture, not loofah! I couldn't tell you if it is durable, because he hasn't played with it enough to actually rip it.It contains two squeakers that scare him.My guess is some dogs would like this toy, the shape is pleasing to dogs, I think my dog just didn't like the texture.I reccommend anything by Fat Cat Inc. in place of this toy."
4,"Sorry to see the series ending, but at least there's this CD","Co-curated by the series' musical supervisors, KCRW DJ's Gary Calamar and Thomas Golubic, this 2nd soundtrack CD does an excellent job of capturing the show's offbeat introspectiveness and moody aesthetic. More than any other TV series, Six Feet has had me doing internet searches following most episodes to answer the question, ""what was that song?"" This CD does unveil a few of those mysterious voices, particularly the breathy Sia and the French electronic band Phoenix. There are also several more well known artists and songs, but they're ones that suit the show. Setting aside the ready availability of many of the songs elsewhere, it's just a well designed collection of music that is worth repeated listens. Anyway, one can never hear Coldplay's wonderful ""Rush of Blood"" too many times, eh?"
3,Songs From A Funeral Home,"The songs on the second volume of music from the now ended HBO drama Six Feet Under perfectly capture the dark essence of the show. Of the thirteen tracks, four are new releases and the best of them is the Arcade Fires' elegant ""Cold Wind"" which has a brilliant melody and shows that this band needs and deserves to reach a massive audience. The Caesars do a solid remake of ""(Don't Fear) The Reaper"" and Jem's ""Amazing Life"" has a fine, airy quality. The previously released tracks all fit the funeral home vibe of the show and it's nice too see that lesser known but great songs by superstars Coldplay & Radiohead (""A Rush Of Blood To The Head"" & ""Lucky"" respectively) are used instead of their better known ones."
5,A great compilation,This is a great collection of music. It's evocative of the series and a good collection of music regardless. I'd say it's slightly better than the original soundtrack album and is great for that late night listening. Well worth a try.Feel free to check out my blog which can be found on my profile page.
3,"Six Feet Under, Vol. 2: Everything Ends","An interesting selection of songs. Many were outstanding, while others just ""so so."" This is a CD that is fine for a few plays, but I wouldn't recommend buying it for the few strong cuts on the disc."
4,4 year old love it,"My four year old daughter really enjoyed this collection. She loves all of the Disney Princess items and this cartoon collection seemed to hook her for the entire episode, which is no small accomplishment. Overall a good value to keep your toddler occupy for a short time."
2,Did not capture my 3 year old's attention,I thought anything with princesses would interest my three year old but she was disinterested very early into the movie.
1,tupperware seals storage,I did not like this product. It would not fit in any of my cupboards. It was a waste of money!
2,Destroyed 2 knife edges with this,"It took a while to figure out what the problem was. This sharpener took ""bites"" out of two nice knife blades. I also have had it 4-5 years and then the problem developed. I won't use it at all now and use a wustof for santoku and just ordered a Furi Diamond Fingers here for my regular blades. I am surprised this is on the market."
3,Strong cable but heavy,The item is bigger than its look. So they are quite heavy. Combined they weight over 1 lb. The lock itself weights 6 oz. The dial works but it is sort of cumbersome and takes a while to master. The wire coils naturally so it is good for hanging on bike. I suggest keeping the wire but replace the lock with one that won't make you sweat at night in a dark corner.
2,Get plastic locking ties.,"There is nothing special about these other than they have colors. They simply wrap around, there is no loop (like a belt) that keeps the tie from spreading out. For wire management I prefer the one-time use plastic locking ties. They are very cheap and hold the wires much more securely."
2,Useful if just placed and not untied...,"But my intention was using these to tie and untie frequently used cables (power cords, headphones, etc), but these ties lack a tightening mechanism which you must try to do by yourself before applying the velcro part... These beats the purpose of having a quick method of wrapping and tying cables... Might work for those occasions where you simply want to leave a cable tied up for a long time..."
4,It's velcro,"They do what they're supposed to. However, if your using them for audio cables (like myself) and you're going to be frequently wrapping and unwrapping them, I would suggest getting a brand that allows you to keep one end permanently attached to the cable. I've already lost 2 of them at gigs!"
5,No more wire mess,"These Cable Ties are the best. You can wrap excess wire with one and have a very neat bundle. I use it on the cables for chargers, and if you need to extend the cables out it is very simple and also simple to wrap them up again. I have used them on all my computer cables, making my desk much neater.I have even taken a few to work and used them to keep tangled cords in order. I have color coded mine so that I know which bundle is for mouse, keyboard,monitor,printer etc. They are very easy to put on and also very easy to take off, if you change units."
3,Wrong Filter,I too have fallen victim to purchasing the filter recommended for the product. I just assumed that the recommended filter would actually fit the fryer purchased. I have contacted the seller. I am sure they are aware of this issue and will correct it for me. At least I hope they do. Will let you all know if anything other than a satisfactory resolution is reached.
1,These are not for the 05442 model!,"Be careful when ordering these filters. Take a good look at the filter in your fryer first. The Presto Cool Daddy 05442 model uses rectangular filters, not these."
5,Filters found,"Needed filters for Cool Daddy Fryer, couldn't find these locally. Wouldn't really think you'd need filters for an electric fryer would you? You will be surprised on how much a filter helps cut down on the ""grease fumes"""
1,WRONG FILTER ! ! !,"When I ordered the Presto Professional Cool Daddy electric deep fryer, this is the filter that is recommended for this fryer. When you get them, THEY ARE SHAPED WRONG! The Presto deep fryer I bought uses a rectangle filter with rounded corners. The filters they sent are crescent shaped...like a half moon. The filters come from a different seller than the fryer (kind of stupid). I contacted the private seller and they said these are the filters that go to my model# deep fryer. I sent them back and was refunded. Now I am not sure where to get the right ones. I may have to get in touch with Presto, the maker of the deep fryer. If you order this deep fryer, DO NOT order the filters they offer separately.THEY DO NOT FIT AND YOU WILL WASTE YOUR MONEY!!!"
1,Wrong Filters,Ordered the filters and once they arrived I discovered they were not correct. Did not bother to send them back. I will cut and use them.
1,bad,cool daddy does not take this filter however its looks if you cut the curved filters it might work which i didbe careful do not cut or you will be like me and have to throw them away and order from presto
4,You will get the point,This book is great when you want to understand quantitative genetics. I used it for my major thesis in dairy cattle breeding en fount it very useful. It will help you get the point in the confusing world called genetics.
3,Slicker than the first--but with less inspiration,"2nd effort by the distaff hard rock unit is not the Runaways' best album--but the one that sold the most (I believe it peaked at #192 on the Billboard charts). Critics were silenced after calling the first album a joke; it proved that the girls could really play (and not only that, but get their personalities across in the group-written songs, with occasional help from Kim Fowley and early co-founder Kari Krome). The production is cleaner(probably due to Earle Mankey's help) and there are some great, expressive moments: Joan Jett's ""I Love Playin' With Fire"" is a classic rocker, Cherie Currie's ""Heartbeat"" is full of backstage pomp, ""Hollywood"" is a punky ball of fire, and Lita Ford's closer, ""Johnny Guitar"", ends with a wicked guitar solo. A few shrieky spots here and there, and less good-natured fun overall than their first outing, but still disarming."
1,Yup - bad ghosting with this low-quality cable,"Hey - my first review! Go me. Anyway, I bought this cable for about $10 at Staples today, after blowing off one at Radio Shack for $25. This was to extend the reach of a new 19"" Dell LCD (analog). I get horrible ghosting and some twitchy text. I tested the monitor (with a normal cable) on my laptop, and it looks great - I tested it again on the laptop with this extension cable in between, and the ghosting came back. I guess you get what you pay for - the Radio Shack one (I forget the brand, but it wasn't the house brand - maybe 3M?) was super thick. I think I'll just order a high-quality 10' male-male cable with the shielding the other poster referred to. Sorry Belkin, this one's a dud."
1,Garbage!,"Fuzzy video and ghosting when used at 1280x1024 pixels, 85hz refresh rate. Slightly better but still unacceptable at 70hz."
3,Error in book,"A book dedicated to colors really can't afford making a major mistake as found on page 26 where Cyan is described as the mixture of Red and Blue. Not only in words, but also in a colorful RGB model. (Cyan is a mixture of Green and Blue). I just bought this book to get a clear introduction into (the theory of) colors and this mistake confused me a lot. I thank the Spirit for Wikipedia :).Anyway, I still recommend this book because it tries to explore allmost every aspect of colors and I like the design !!Jan Hoogesteijn, Amsterdam Netherlands"
2,Convenient compact design but lots of problems,I bought two of these - for each of my kids bedrooms. It is nice and compact with the clock and the cd player -- perfect for their bedside music. The problem is they don't keep time correctly -- every time there is a power outage (and they go on the back up battery) both start to run ahead (they seem to pick up 10 minutes every few months). One of them is now not playing the cd without hitting the button five times and turning it on and off a few times. It also sometimes starts playing music in the middle of the night on its own.I was here looking to replace with the Sony (figured it was better quality) and was surprised to see another review liking this one and having problems with the Sony....
1,Clock Display Stopped Working,"After less than one year of use, the display for the clock stopped working. When I called RCA to complain and get a replacement, they told me they had no record of my warrantee submission, and that they would do nothing for me without a receipt. Either keep your receipt or look for another product."
5,THANK YOU!!!,Thank you for offering this product. Was skeptical about spending the money on this product but after suffering from vertigo for 4 months and no end in sight decided to take the chance. This product worked like a charm. Would def. spend the money on it again.
5,great!!!!,are true to size wash well look good buy them I am going back for another pair. i am giving some for gifts....
5,yoga pants,i love these they are very comfortable hold their shape well and were an excellent price. i wear them all different ocassions. even the black can be worn as dress when paired with nice blouse..
1,too short,I read that these run long but if you generally need tall sizes then these won't work for you. had to return them.
3,It was good for awhile,This Yoga pants are very comfortable i must say....I do excrise alot so if u dont I dont recommand these for ....They make you look shaped up really good and they are comfortable like i said....just after awhile in between your legs it changes colores and after washing a few times its starts to fade.i dont like that...these arefor pple that do Yoga like it said and that workout only a little
3,Bella Yoga Pants,"I love the pants, they accent my curves. The only problem is they are too long. I am 5 foot 4 so I need to get them hemmed. Otherwise good fit."
4,Nice pants,"Nice yoga pants. From the earlier reviews, I thought the pants would come in a longer length. However, at 6'0 tall they're just too short for me. So anyone who's looking for really long yoga pants, these will not work. However, I've decided to hem them into capri's."
4,I like these yoga pants!,I am pleased with my yoga pants. Super comfy and nicely made. Cheaper than some I found in stores around. Would recommend!
4,Nice Quality,"The product came promptly, is nicely constructed (sewn) but the ""navy"" shown in the web photo is not what was received. What i received was a ""washed out"" blue. Everything was fine, but it you really want ""navy"" this is not the product for you."
5,PERFECT FIT!,"I normally don't write many reviews, but I got these pants in and they are a FANTASTIC fit! I read a good bit of reviews saying the didnt fit true to size but mine are awesome! I will be back to buy another pair soon!"
3,Size is smaller than I thought,"Ordered a large, and it's more of a medium when you try them on. Good thing it's stretchy! Other than that they are a nice cut and seem to be well made."
3,thin material and sizing is off,"material felt like it could tear easily, and the size i ordred should have been adequate, but these were to small to get them up even"
4,perfect,The Bella cotton spandex fitness yoga pants fit great. Be sure to review the size chart so you get the correct size. I normally wear a medium but after consulting the chart determined that in this product it had to be a large. Love them. Will have to get another pair!
1,NOT FLATTERING!,"I don't get how reviewers are giving this 5 stars?! tks alot totally tricked me into buying a pair. ordered a small but the material is too thin or something because it gives you .. umm how do I say.. a very unflattering view between your legs! haha anyway havent worn these in public once but it wasn't worth retunring because of the restocking/shipping fee. ugh. waste of money, dont buy. thats what i get for trying to buy cheap yoga pants.. stick to lululemon!!!"
2,"Late coming, but it did finally arrive","We had some shipping issues with this product (as we did with about 6 others). This one was delayed, but eventually did find my recipient and she loves them. Thank you."
2,Not what I expected,I rated this pants low because the fabric was very thin.Size not that of other brands.Length good.Arrived on time.
3,Yoga pants,"I wanted a thicker pair of workout pants. They are a little thicker, but they were more belled at the bottom than I like. They were longer in length, I am 5' 4"" & I hemmed them 2 inches."
4,Nice fit,"I am 5'9"" and a size 10 and they fit perfect! The waist band is not too tight and the length is great."
2,Very tight band!,"I found these pants while I was looking to buy a secondary pair of yoga pants from a brand that I already own. These were suggested by Amazon and I was drawn to the fact that these had a long inseam. I prefer yoga/ athletic pants to be long.So, I ordered these in black and I was disappointed. The top band of these are WAY too tight. They are high waisted and sit at the top of your natural waist, which I do not care for, and then, the top band is very constricting. Many brands of yoga pants have a band that you can fold down- these also do not fold. These are very uncomfortable to wear. I am a medium in most clothes- sometimes a small depending on the brand. The medium fits fine everywhere but at the top of the waistband. I do like that length, but thats about it. I wish I had just ordered what I had intended to."
4,ANACONDAS,I LOVE CREATURE FEATURES. THE FIRST WAS PRETTY GOOD. THIS ONE LOOKS LIKE LAKE PLACID MEETS DEEP BLUE SEA.
1,WHY?,One of the worst movies of all time is coming out with a sequel that will be even worse. Why is this movie being made?
4,Could've been better,"This is a great movie, its better than the first, its thrilling, and it will keep you guessing what will happen next. But, the ending should've been different, and the movie was not that scary. But overall, this movie is worth watching."
1,This Is Gonna Be A Flop!!!!,"This movie right here is gonna be one of the worst movies I think I have seen in a while. I mean c'mon people the first movie was stupid, pointless, and just flat out gay. Espically when you have the people playing in the first one like they did, that is and was a total reach. This movie isnt gonna be any better, in fact it will probably be worse, I watched the trailer for it the other day and everybody was like ooooo ahhhh im just like ohhhh god kill me now this is gonna be stupid. August looks like it has some great kick ass movies commin out such as Alien Vs Predator then they come out with this horrendous sherade and it just kills it. I'll probably go see it because I work in a movie theater and I'll get to see it for free the night before the movie is actually released but I will probably end up doing the same thing I did when watching Van Helsing....LEAVE 35 minutes into it"
1,Belkin FEU133-06 Pro Series Hi-Speed USB Cable,"Came with the ""rubber"" insulator melted to each other. Pulling it apart exposed the actual wire of the cable. Last time I'll buy from Belkin, monoprice it is from now on I guess."
1,Belkin F3U133-06 Pro Series Hi-Speed USB Cable (Six-Feet),Amazon listed this cable as an item you could purchase with a particular pen scanner I have. I purchased it solely because I lost the USB cable for that scanner. The USB cable did not fit the scanner. I'm sure the cable is of good quality.
1,Defective,"Usually when I see amazon 1 star reviews I am leery, especially for a cable. But yes the cable was defective...I was ripping my hair out trying to get something to work from my new printer...I kept telling myself no it cant be the cable, what kind of company makes a defective cable. But alas it was, a different cable and everything worked in 5 seconds. Maybe all the people who have had the bad cable keep getting the one that is returned like a white elephant christmas gift. Anyhow, you may have better luck, but maybe not :)"
3,For Those with Zero Experience,"I have both a Bachelor's and Master's in Architecture, and thought that this book might provide some insight into portfolio design, since I had only had short crash courses (read: 1 hour lectures) off and on about portfolio design. Unfortunately, the book does not really provide much more in the way of concrete information or tips. If you know the basics of design, this book is not helpful. If you're applying to architecture school and need a starting point, this book MAY help - just make sure to get the most recent addition because the information and trends can become dated quickly."
5,Garmin Cable,This product is as described by the seller. It works great hooking up your GPS to the computer. I would recommend the purchase of this product if you need to update your GPS.
4,Work Great!,It works just fine! The usb cord was combatible to my garmin and so that a plus! And for price it was a great investment!
5,Amazon Verified Purchase,Used it right away. Was finally able to give my GPS a full charge instead of only the charge it receives during actual use in my vehicle. Very pleased.
3,Garmin USB same as Blackberry USB,"I was disappointed to find that the USB cable that I purchased for my Garmin was actually the exact same USB cable that I had for my Blackberry. (It actually had the Blackberry logo on it) It wasn't a real problem, I just would have liked to know exactly what I was purchasing before taking the time to purchasing it."
1,Disappointed,"The vendor who sold this is excellent, and the review is not a reflection on them...they are 5 star.In selling this cable, Garmin has provided an aftermarket product that really has a one time use for most people. You buy the GPS, and you need this cable to download the latest maps to your Nuvi (or other). Once you have done the download, this cable is effectively useless, as you wont have any need, (at least that I can see), to ever use the cable again.Shame on you Garmin! This should have been part of the original purchase, and not an aftermarket part to make the company a few more dollars."
5,Great purchase,Very happy that I decided to use Amazon for my cable purchase. It was a fabulous price compared to retail stores and it was brand new. I had my Garmin updated very quickly. Would not hesitate to purchase here again.
2,Works but not the same as original,"The original cable received with Garmin GPS product has a filter between the two ends. The cable delivered doesn't so the cable received is a generic cable rather than the cable supplied with the Garmin product. It works and so far, the lack of the filter has not damaged the Garmin device but I am still nervous when I use it."
5,Works Great!,This cable works great! I have no complaints on it whatsoever. It's worth the money to get the Garmin connected to the Internet and the available free downloads.
5,It does what a pen should do...very well.,"This is the best pen that I have used. It works on a multitude of paper types. It can be abused, left uncapped, and can be placed for months in a stationary position or storage and perform amazingly well. The consistency of coverage is even and distinct. It does what a pen should do...very well. I have to be uncapped for the majority of my work day, as I use the pen too often to continue to uncap it. It has never dried out, or written unevenly. Be warned: If you buy a dozen, everyone will try to steal one from you."
4,Nice pen at a nice price!,"Okay, so I'm pretty fussy when it comes to pens. I like a fine line, a bold imprint, and a nice smooth writing style. This pen has it all. My biggest problem is that other people keep stealing it."
1,Exclusive skip/scratch technology,"I'm not very picky when it comes to pens; I just want something that's reliable, something that won't skip every few words. I picked these pens because of the statement made by the manufacture ""Exclusive ink/tip technology produces the smoothest gel ink flow available"". I bought some, and the pens skip and scratch badly. If it was only one pen I could write it off as a fluke, but as it is, these pens are the worst I've ever used. I can't even write a short grocery list without going over and over half the words, it's rather frustrating. I have some cheap 8 year old pens that write a lot better, and I'll be tossing these energel pens in the garbage. If you do buy them, I hope you end up with much better pens than I did."
2,A pain to use,"I don't know what all the other stellar reviews are about. When using this pen, there is a scratchy friction where the nib hits the paper.. like it is dried out or something. Also the ink flow is not smooth and it does not write properly without a lot of pressure at the correct angles. And so the search continues..."
5,Works Great!,This worked perfectly right out of the box. It doesn't get overly warm like other reviews have stated.
4,Review,"Works great, but it gets really hot over long periods of time. Since I usually keep my computer on, this happens quite often. In fact, the adapter itself is starting to deform due to the heat. But other than that, works great in place of my broken one"
5,Does the trick,"I was worried buying this product having seen the reviews on here and other sites. But I didnt have many other options, I have a 2005 pontiac g6 gt and to do anything with the stereo on my car everything you buy aftermarket has to be a perfect fit. This fit perfectly for an aftermarket install of a pioneer double din dvd player. The only bad thing about this product is that the snap on trim is a little too big, but other than that it fits in my dash perfectly and securely."
3,an okay buy,"This product worked have of the way intended, thats why it recieves only a 3 star rating. The actual housing for my ddin Boss audio system fit in perfectly, but the trim ring for it was waaay too small, other than that its perfect. The plastic housing for the kit looks nice enough so i'll leave it like that until i can find a larger trim ring."
1,Ahhhh! Bleach my eyes!,"Yet another talentless hack. Listen little girls, there is a reason why the whole stadium at the superbowl booed her, and why she lip synchs ""live"": (...). Another cookie cutter MTV person that will make millions and fade away in a couple years."
4,Good but could be better,Wondeful pens just that I feel the barrel a little bit too thick. That's my only complain. I'm looking forward to the same flowing writing but in a slimmer body.
4,Slightly disappointed,"I love the quality of this pen, but they run out very quickly. One pen lasts under a week. I write a lot at my job, but most pens last longer than a week."
3,Better than expected,This Iron was much better than expected it heats quickly and provides a nice steam. I do not yet know how it works on heavier fabrics but for cotten shirts and non-jean material I have no complaints on it. Works greatthe Iron does not lock when closed but other than that I have no problems with it.
5,A Handy travel item,Heats quickly and eliminates the wrinkles in a jiffy. no problems with it so far
2,cheap camera,"cheap camera, does what is says not much more....a good toy, I would not recommend it for any real security purposes ( it would make a ok baby monitor although it does not work well in low light )it seems to run the same software (& firmware) as theD-Link DCS-900 10/100TX Home Security Internet Camera"
3,not packaage very well,Fryer wasn't packed very well and therefore both wheels were damaged and fell off. Because I needed to use the fryer immediately I didn't take the time to report this. Ruins the Nostalgia look of the fryer.
1,A complete mess,"This book is absolutely the worst golf instruction book ever written. It shouldn't be named after Mike Austin, for the takeaway is in complete contradiction to Austin's method. Shauger actually 'borrows' his takeaway from Joe Dante of ""The 4 Moves to Winning Golf"". Shauger is only 40 years behind Dante in that department.But the biggest beef with this book is the ridiculous pictures and drawings. They don't in any way shape or form correspond to a golf swing. That's why you see no actual swings of his models analyzed. You do see lots of posed pictures and confusing descriptions.The diagrams are - to be most charitable - unhelpful.If you buy this book, buy it from me, I'll let it go very, very cheap. It is a complete waste of money."
4,THE book to have on this topic,"This is an authoritative and complete manual on the ju-no-kata (forms of gentleness). The photos and text make each move and each technique clear for both tori and uke. It is a technical manual useful for a judo student studying this form, or for anyone interested in the author since it includes a section with her photo album.The author is the foremost authority in the world on this Kodokan kata. I wish it had been expanded even more from the original version previously published in Born for the Mat. The author's insights are valuable and it is good to have them recorded in this book."
4,...you can't please all of the people all of the time,"I used this kit and passed the exam easily. I agree that it could be updated with better end of chapter questions. It is an essentials book, so I didn't expect it to be The Authority on networking; just the basics to help me pass an exam. It delivered what it said it would. Of all the resources that I've used for various certification exams, there is not one that I have found that has the ability to be the only one to use. And no book is a substitute for practice/experience."
2,Not good enough,"An adequate book, in the tradition of other Microsoft Press offerings, but clearly insufficient as a sole resource for exam preparation. Also not nearly enough information to be practical in a real-life situation! Better test prep materials can be had from the Exam Cram series. Another hint for prosepective MCSE test-takers: take the Networking Essentials exam last, after the other core subjects and after the electives. The material by then will all be familiar and you won't have to study much of anything in order to pass the exam!"
2,The Expensive Way To Fail!,"Just failed my test after making the mistake of assuming that a book by Microsoft would prepare me for a test by Microsoft. I should have checked these reviews before purchase. The questions at the end of each section of this book are WAY easier than the real questions and the book doesn't cover several topics on the test. In particular, there are several detailed protocol questions (especially related to NetWare) that are glossed over in the book. I think this book is great as an intro to networking technology, but it doesn't prepare you for the test."
3,"Good Foundation for networking & the exam, but not the best.","This book excels at backfilling any holes about general networking you may have. Believe me, this book starts at the beginning and gradually brings you up to speed. Unit 3, with OSI and protocol stacks can be a little harsh to Networking newbies. Unit 7 is also a little light in presenting and preparing you to understand Advanced WAN Technologies. Test Question and especially the Unit Tests, give you problems and questions very similar to those found on the exam. Despite 800+ pages though, you get the feeling Microsoft went a little light on the depth of coverage on network topics. Overall, the book does a good job of both building a foundation of networking expertise and preparing you to pass exam 70-58 for the MCSE track."
3,Not the same bags that came with Sentria,I was disappointed to find that the bags do not have the two cardboard hooks to latch the bag onto the nozzle inside. Without those hooks I could not secure the bag to keep it from sliding off. I just bought my Kirby less than a month ago. Maybe these are for an older Sentria.
2,No secure tab holes,My bags I buy from Kirby has 2 cutouts around the opening of the bag. These cutouts allow for some tabs on the vacuum to fit in for secure holding. These bags do not have the secure bag holding cut out features.
5,satisfied,"I received the bags in a timely manner. They are exactly the ones I have purchased previously at the vacuumm store, only they are $9 cheaper. I will continue to order this product, I am very satisfied."
3,Did not fit,I ordered these thinking they would fit my Kirby Sentria but they did not. I did however rig them so that they would. I needed to vaccuum more than I needed to send them back for a refund or trade.
5,no more stinky smell,works much better than the ugly brown bags. it used to smell like burning hair and now i don't smell anything :)
1,Does not fit new Sentria!,I ordered these because they mentioned fitting the Sentria. I just bought my Sentria 5 months ago and ran out of bags that came with the vacuum. These bags do not fit - the cardboard piece that attaches the bag to the vacuum doesn't have the top and bottom clips for attachment. It is a pain trying to buy bags for your Kirby online - I wish I had a Kirby store nearby!
1,they dont fit and i cant return,do not buy them for you kirby sentra they will not fit i bought them in october didn't need the right away when i opened the package they don't fit and there is only a 30 day return period this is worng
5,TWISTA FIRST UNDERGROUND OR MAJOR CLASSIC?,"FIRST OF ALL THIS IS TWISTA'S FIRST ALBUM IF YOU DON'T THINK IT'S HOT YOU ARE CRAZY BECAUSE THE BEATS ARE TIGHT AND HIS FLOW IS WAY WAY BETTER THAN WHAT HE'S TAKING ABOUT NOW FAVORITE SONGS ON THE CD IS ""ONE DOWN TWO TO GO"" JAZZAMATAZZ"" ""BACK TO SCHOOL"" AND OTHERS SO IF YOU CAN'T OR CAN COP IT CUZ IT MUST BE A CHI TOWN CLASSIC AND TO THE RAP GAME!!!!"
3,"The earth & the wind are gone, and the fire's starting to dwindle a bit","Not really a BAD album; it has a couple of good moments, but when you think of the heights that he took EWF to, not to mention that he'd been making solo albums for more than a decade up to this point, it's not the freshest sounding thing that you'd hope a talented artist like him would come up with."
1,"Great turntable, but doesn't work","I was thrilled to get this for Christmas and finally be able to enjoy all my old vinyl again, but after a month I still can't figure out the software and calls to Gemsound's tech support have not been helpful. I have managed to get harsh static (after some effort) but no music at all. It's a great idea but it simply does not work."
2,A bit too sweet for my taste buds,"Just made my first shake according to the package instructions (i.e., with 8 oz. of non fat milk). It was so sweet I could barely get it down. I'm going to try adding some ice to it and maybe some water to dilute it a bit more. If this is as good as it gets though I can't see myself consistently drinking through the three cans of this shake mix. If I can't get it to be more palatable I'll be requesting a refund."
1,Honestly I spent about a hundred worth but trashed it,"It's good it works to make you not hungry for me for up to 6 hours but it's full of chemichal's known to cause cancer.Aspartame,acuelfame,etc.Seriously just get up and run I started 3 weeks ago now i'm up to 8-10 miles per day on wii fit plus.Only one hour a day I have already lost 7 percent fat and gained 4 percent muscle.My problem with this besides the chemichal was that I wouldn't want to eat anything because I was full so I would've stored fat......"
1,Blech!,"I mixed the powder and milk, and then added frozen bananas and strawberries to cover the taste of the vanilla powdered drink. Someone else had recommended it- I found it *totally* disgusting! And, it smells awful. Won't be using the Slim Fast again! Gross."
2,The worst of the 4 versions I've heard,"Ugh. Of all the les mis ive listened to this is the worst. Valjean (morris) sounds like a whiny baby. Javert (Quast) is good, but i liked his performance on the 10th anniversary edition beter. The Thenardier's dont sound like they're having as much fun as the ppul in the other editions. Cosette's voice is weak and is piercing enough to pop balloons. Marius (Ball) is pretty good, but he appears in a lot of other versions too. If you are looking for a single copy to buy, this isnt it. If you have previous copies and really want to hear the whole thing, then i guess it's okay. other than that, i would recomment the 10th anniversary edition or the remastered broadway."
3,"Good, but casting hurts this CD","This CD is good, but has several major problems-pros-The Orchestration is amazing! This CD has ALL of the music, and the Orchestrations are perfect. It's just amazing.Slower Tempo then the other recordings, you can hear more of the small details in the beatiful music.Enjoras, Marius, and Javert stand out as amazing preformances.Did I mention it contains everything?Cons-The slower tempo makes some songs less exciting.The Vejean is not good... He doesn't ruin the CD, and he has his good moments, but he really is bad compared to Colm Wilcomson. Fantine is alright, but her voice is too uncertain, and it doesn't have strength. The last dissapointingpreformance was Cossete, not as bad a Vejean or Fantine, but her voice is squeaky and annoying. The rest of the cast is not great, but not bad.So the only REAL problem is the bad casting, though some preformances shine. I'm sorry for any spelling mistakes."
1,"Les Mis is my favorite musical , but NOT THIS ALBUM","All the actors are not good , exept Javert . The Valjean was not doing what people expected him to do . Though it was the complete recording , it was the worst performance of Les Mis . The chorus had an obvious American accent and I heard that they first recorded the music then the singing . The Javert is best one in this album . And to tell the truth , I do not think that it is worth the price . If your looking for the best Les Mis then the 10th anniversary is the one you should look for . It is to easy to notice that the singers are using 'artficial' moods especially Valjean , Mme. Thenadier and Mister Thenadier . The whole thing is hard to enjoy I just feel tricked . BUT if they had better singers (besides Javert) , English accents , and if they recorded the whole thing at once , then Bullseye . I think if you are looking for the best recording then Defenently check out the 10th Anniversary ."
5,Awesome Tribute to the Greatest Musical of All Time,"I love this recording of my all-time favorite musical. The orchestra really makes this recording soar, as I saw the show on tour with a smaller one. The entire recording, for the most part, sounds terrific. Gary Morris is not my favorite Valjean, but he makes ""Bring Him Home"" his own in a wonderful way. Philip Quast is unbeatable as Javert, as are Michael Ball and Anthony Warlow in their roles as Marius and Enjorlas (Michael Ball is so my hero!!!). My only complaint with this recording is the version of ""A Little Fall of Rain"". Eponine's voice, which is awesome throughout the whole recording, is AWFUL during this song, and it really ruins the song. Other than that, a wonderful recording!"
4,The only Complete Recording of Les Mis,"Although I have never seen Les Miserables, When I listen to this CD I feel like I have seen it 100 times and know it by heart. The casting may have not been the best, but I do think that it is a really good CD."
4,A Beef with Quast,"I think that, on the whole, this recording is excelent. As has been previously mentioned, it is the only recording to house every note within the show, and as such is an invaluable resource to those who are : A. diehard fans or B. Performers.That said, Philip Quast cannot read a time signature, or at least struggles mightly with it on this recording. I know that others enjoy his performance, but when you are reading the score and he is a full 10 bars behind and ignoring and adding rests left right and sideways it becomes grating after a while.Anyway... great cd on the whole, but if you dig Javert, Allum is better than Mann, who beats the pants off of Quast. Liberties with time.....oh dear"
4,Mencius (Penguin Classics),"Penguin has once again provided an affordable, very readable edition of a classic work. The book is nicely proportioned with a comfortable print."
1,Bad,This product is not effective. Do not buy this because it will not clean your equipment well. The airflow from it is not as good as other products. The plastic piece on the top holding the straw tube and trigger also breaks easily.
1,"Please, No more Biggie","""Nasty girl"" is just ""Nasty Boy"" The Remix or Part 2. Biggie's verse is th same first verse from ""Nasty Boy"". Then The others on this recorded new material and a new name and new instrumental was given and it was passed off as a new song. That is not right. It seems that Biggie has no unreleased material left and Puffy/Diddy still wants to make money off of him but Isn't he already? Doesn't Puffy/Diddy still make money off of sales from ""Ready to die"", ""Life after death"" and ""Born again""? and What about his ""Press play"" and ""No way out"". It seems to me that Puffy/Diddy will do anything with Bibbie to make money. This song suck and so does the Whole ""Biggie Duets"" Album. If the Biggie Duets is supposed to be what it would be like if the musicians who appears on the album to be able to work with Biggie, that tells me that Puffy/Diddy can't accept the fact that Biggie is gone. Just Left Biggie RIP"
3,Get the Yellow Dunlop!,This was suggested to me when I bought my guitar case from Amazon. I would suggest that you purchase the yellow version of this exact brand pick. I discovered this when I started taking lessons. My instructor used the yellow and it was more flexible not so stiff like the green. Flexible = Good. Get the yellow
1,poop,terrible the design comes off by ur sweat and i didnt like the thinkness of this pick...also my strings are hard and the pick wears off easy....DO NOT BUY
5,Does the job,"I've used these for a long time now. I bought these from Amazon and I was very satisfied. I don't play pro so I can't judge them from that point of view. Nevertheless, I play all the time and these picks are great."
1,Agreed - similar experiences,"I find the display to be too bright. I've resorted to covering the clock with a sticky, turning the face to a wall, or keeping it under my bed. I've had the same problems setting the alarm, so it goes off at 5:40 am and 5:40 pm. The most irritating bit for me, is the inability to determine the order that songs will be played from the USB device. There doesn't seems to be any clear organizational pattern.My remote does work from at least 10 feet away. The strength of the batteries might have a something to do with it.I do love the ability to have my television as the input. I can then wear headphones, watch-tv and not wake my partner.finally, The speaker cords are short, so I lengthened them with additional speakerwire."
5,very happy,this product was as described and very good. wax is high quality and just what we needed......thank you very much
3,To answer a previous review,"To answer a previous review, if you use fabric softener when you wash you will drastically reduce any towels ability to absorb.Ignore the rating I did not purchase these towels."
4,One says absorbant the other says non absorbant??,Ignore rating as I have not tried my towels yet...bought 2 sets.How can two people be so far apart on these towels??
3,Lost in the mail,"The wristband was misdirected as the seller left off a critical part of the address i have on file at Amazon. They were nice enough to send me another wristband. The original wristband was eventually delivered. So now I have 2.The wristband is as pictured. Bright, not flimsy, and with a powerful message.I had been led to believe that they fit 'close' from one of the reviews on Amazon. I found the adult one was quite big. Too big/loose for me really. It's better sized for a man's wrist than that of a 140(-ish) pound woman."
2,Metal is way too soft,This quiche pan is not very good and I would not recommend it to anyone. The metal is way too soft as I bent the rim while washing it.
4,recommendable book,"This is a very interesting topical dictionary of classical mythology. However most of accounts are requotations from older dictionaries or encyclopedias ,for example William Smith's Dictionary of Greek and Roman Biography & Mythology. In addition I wonder the author really read original Greek and Latin texts, since there are many mistakes of sources or passages/chapter number of the authority.So I must advise readers ""You should check the source by yourself"". Admitting these weak points , it is a useful and readable book."
3,Reliable camera that takes great pictures but slow and pieces tend to fall off,"We've had this camera for 3 years now. I use it for pictures of our kids and have been very satisified with picture quality.PROS1. Great clarity of pictures - have made several 8x10 prints without any blurring or fuzziness2. When you use lithium batteries the camera does eat up batteries as much as my friend's cameras do with the same batteries3. I've had this camera for 3 years and it still works greatCONS1. Very slow - even if you turn off the image display. The flash takes forever to reset itself making it difficult to click several pictures in a row2. The videos taken on this camera are almost always too dark to view. This can be corrected with the software that comes with the camera, but then they are blurry3. A small round piece continually falls off the lens area of the camera. It has done this since we got it practically. It replaces easily and doesn't change how well the camera functions."
3,Amusing little flick,"Women (a.k.a. Les Femmes) is an amusing little comedy. The interaction between the two stars, Bardot and Ronet, is very good and often funny. The problem is that there isn't enough interaction. The movie often flashes back to Ronet's love affairs.Bardot who plays the role of a flaky scretary is both fun and funny. Now in her mid 30's, she still possesses that endearing childlike playfullness. She doesn't appear to be ashamed at showing what some believe to be her imperfections - her freckles and teeth. Her alleged flaws notwithstanding, Bardot is still a ravishing beauty. Although she appears thinner than usual she looks mighty good to me in her miniskirts.Overall a decent movie with a little twist at the end."
2,"Wow, Cracked Case via FedEx... Beware...","I believe someone else (if not several others) had this exact same experience, and I was skeptical... but sure enough, opened my Amazon box and blarggg... discs splayed everywhere, on account of cracked plastic and -- i guess -- deflated/punctured sealed-air package material?Dear Amazon,Uhh, toss in some peanuts or padding or something. Give these cases some love, a little tenderness. I've seen the most ridiculous(ly awesome) care given to the most preposterous items. But DVDs scratch and crack, so give these badboys a little blanky for their treacherous journeys.Ultimately, who cares... a few DVDs are gonna get tossed anyway, so it's not worth the time and delay to go through a return procedure, but it's worth pointing out since Amazon is so awesome in general."
1,Too many failed attempts,"I bought these discs to create a commemorative DVD for a group of kids. Out of 100 DVDs, we had to discard 27. DON'T BOTHER BUYING THESE Sony DVD-R s. The frustration level was unbearable, but we had 77 kids, and I had to go and get more DVDs. A waste of money and time."
1,Giving up on these,"I used nothing but Sony DVD-R discs for nearly six years and had no problems with them until now. The latest stack that I bought is horribly unreliable. At least 40% of them so far have been bad, not passing data verification or playing back video with glitches even if they do pass it. I tried two different software programs and even replaced my desktop PC's DVD burner in case it was failing, but continued to have bad luck with them. My laptop's DVD burner software sees these discs as 8X rather than 16X like they're rated, and the odds of them working seems to increase at burn speeds below 8X. But I'm definitely not getting what I paid for anymore, so I'll be switching to a new brand."
5,The Best DVD-Rs Offered on the Market,"I will say I am a computer Tech who burns a lot of DVDs and I make sure to verify all discs I burn. With Sony I do not care if you think I am a brand hugger I normally find them at some of the best prices and with a ratio of 5:100 (bad Discs:Good Discs), the best of any brand I have ever used before and still (as sometimes I will buy other types to check them out, or if Sonys are not available)."
5,Excellent value,This was a great price for an excellent product.Have had no problems with the Sony disks and I use quite a few.
5,Great gift for non-techie relatives,"I bought this in order to share photos with my mother-in-law. The free momentolive website is very easy to use and lets me and my brother in law send photos to the frame with ease. The only minor troubleshooting I needed to do was getting the frame to recognize my wireless network, but once I had that figured out, it was smooth sailing all the way."
4,Getting i-mate to connect wirelessly,I'm running Windows XP w/ WMP 11 w/ a Linksys WRT54G router. I'm running wireless security WPA TKIP. I was only able to get the Momento to connect to my router by doing two things.1) Reduce the length of my wireless passkey from 63 to 31 characters...only letters & numbers. I don't know the maximum but 42 was too long. So somewhere between 31 and 42 characters is the maximum.That allowed the Momento to see the router.2) Configure my Kerio firewall to allow local inbound/outbound UDP traffic on port 1900.That allowed the Momento to see WMP11 and sync up. Without doing those two things the frame would not connect.Hope that helps someone. If it wasn't for the passkey issue the item would be fantastic...it really is cool. Note: I'm not using any of the advanced online functions so I can't comment on them.
1,Do Not Buy This Product....Customer Service doesn't exist!,"I purchased this product and in less that 6 months it had lines across photographs randomly. These showed up even on the sample pictures from the factory. In addition, after about 5 minutes...the power would shut off. After emailing customer service numerous times I finally obtain RMA info. I returned the unit almost a month ago and I get no response to emails. The one response I did get said it had been shipped by FedEx as per the attached Airway Bill. Well there was no airway bill attached...so nothing could be tracked. I responded telling them no airway bill was attached and I have not received a response. Considering this was a very expensive frame at the time I purchased it...I am extremely frustrated. I would never purchase another product from this company nor would I advise anyone else to either."
1,If this book is required for your course..,"If this book is required for your course, then it means the publishing company's marketing machine has won over someone powerful in the department under which your course is managed.It's sick how such a crappy book can ""convince"" many course coordinators to make it a required textbook. This book is marketed very well like James Stewarts' Calculus books (table props), but it's even worse than what Stewart puts out (hard to imagine!)."
1,Very disappointing,I usually enjoy books by this author however this book was very difficult to get through. I was unable to relate to or even like the characters; circumstances seemed contrived and implausible. I really dislike the ending.
2,YAAAAAWNNNNNNN,I don't know what they were thinking when they wrote this book. I love the in depth research of China but if I wanted a book on travel I would have bought one. I think that their other books such as Deceptions were MUCH better than this! It needed more spice and intrigue rather than the in depth dialogue on Chinese dumplings.
1,Certainly irritating,"I usually like this writing team, really enjoyed An Act of Love, but this one had such irritating characters. It's possibly because I'm Chinese that I found the characters so stereotyped, but the authors went out of their way to make the characters one-dimensional. And a dimension I could do without. I didn't make it farther than the first 5 chapters. . ."
1,This Deluxe Edition Could Be Great But....,"There is no (s)AINT video!! I will like to rate this product 5 stars but I can't because the 'VERY LONG AWAITED VIDEO' (s)AINT isn't there for the US Release. This is REALLY pissing me off. So, I recommand the Import Version... with it REALLY include (s)AINT video plus a bonus... Personal Jesus (video). Can't beLIEve it..."
4,Yeah what about the (s)aint Video,i as well was excited to see the (s)aint video.. where the f*** is it?
5,Words cannot describe it,"Ok, yea, (S)aint is not on here, but you have to look past it. All the songs on the CD are phenomenal...there should be more, but it is truely a great collection. The DVD is one of the greatest music video dvds I own. All videos are organized by album (ranging from Portriate of an American Family, to The Golden Age of Grotesque). Hands down incredible!!!"
2,I Want What Was Promised!,Where is the (S)Aint video that was promised on Manson's web site? There was all of this BS build up about the banned (S)Aint video that was to be included on the bonus DVD and it's not here. Not to mention the Personal Jesus video was also suppose to be on here as well. I'm a huge Manson fan but at the moment I'm pretty upset and feeling ripped off! Is this some Bull S*** record company stunt to get us to buy insanly priced Japanese version? No way!!!!
3,"If you don't think you like Manson, you probably don't...","You see, I like to give all sorts of music an honest try.I couldn't bring myself to buy any of his (their) albums, even though I was interested in a tune here or there...like ""The Dope Show"".So I thought that here, finally, a collection that may convince me otherwise.It didn't. This isn't a greatest hits album that will convert anyone. The songs are fairly similar, and begin to sound all the same.The tracks benefit from outstanding (and very creative) production values; they ""sound"" terrific. It's just that I had this overwhelming feeling of ""so what?""Now, as a package, this CD is exemplary, with a nice fold-out and the DVD of videos. In fact, the videos are the primary reason anyone should buy this.It's mandatory for the fans, and the uninitiated (like me) can get a fuller picture of the group. They're not all about the music, any more than Kiss or Alice Cooper ever were.The exception, is that I believe those groups had better songs..."
1,0 stars if I could,Don't disregard this review thinking I am just screwing with you. This is one satanic bass tard. His music blows like crap. Honestly In my eyes this music is worse than rap. It is whats wrong with music today. You guys are all tools that listen to this. Don't think your hardcore if you listen to manson. He is a complete freak. Don't give me the crap that hes kool cause hes so original. Hes disgusting far worse than rap. Listen to classic rock and discover what music really is
3,?,"A lot of people seem to be forgetting that it's a ""Greatest Hits"" record, not ""Manson's best material"". This is obviously a shameless attempt at making a few extra bucks from a career that has gone by the wayside. While ""Personal Jesus"" is up there with Manson's best covers, the rest of the material is just some songs that garnered MM a lot of money and fame.The videos are a nice touch, and often better than the songs."
2,a little lackluster.,"i give this 2 stars based only on the compilation aspect of it, not the quality of the music or videos, which is a 5 to me. i was actually paying enough attention to realize i had to order it off the website for the saint video, which i did. but where the hell are the other videos?! Astonishing Panorama, Tainted Love (the funniest manson video ever), and Personal Jesus (especially since it's the lead single off this compilation).worth it still, especially when you find all the easter eggs in the DVD, but... lackluster. could've been a lot better, and from the advertising, i was under the impression that it would have all manson's videos. i feel a little misled."
1,STINKS - STANKS - STUNKS!!!!,I should have taken the advice of the others who have had trouble with this cable. I have a HP Injet (color) of which it says it is fully (100%) compatible with....IT'S NOT!!!!I spent five hours trying to get it to work to no avail. Their web site even offers help for my particular printer....Didn't help..It's Going back to Amazon today!!!!
1,doesn't work,"I purchased one of these so I could use my HP Laserjet 2100 with an iMac (OSX 10.6). The printer is recognized by the computer, but if it prints at all, it spews page after page of garbage. The printer also does not work properly in my Win 7 virtual on the iMac. I have read of other people having similar problems. Sadly, I think I'm going to have to ditch this wonderful work horse of a printer. :-("
2,Good....except for significant built-in flaw,"I bought this for the big, blue numbers. It turns out to have a major (in my opinion)flaw: it blinks between time and alarm set radio station number. I don't need to see what radio station the alarm is set to after I set it. For me, nothing more annoying that looking at the clock to see time and see a radio station number instead. I called RCA/Thomson about this and was told there is NOTHING that can be done as it is part of the hard-wired function. Do NOT get this clock if you expect to see the time when you want to, despite the attractive blue numbers. I will not buy RCA again. If this manufactured flaw is in this clock, it is likely in ALL of theirs."
4,meets my needs,"Got exactly what I paid for. only wish that there was a way to reserve radio stations to memory - but otherwise: the clock is compact yet provides extra large numbers, so easy to read by my bedside and doesn't hog too much space on the nightstand. easy to set and snooze... i like it."
3,I thought I was crazy until...,"I read some of the reviews talking about the buzzing noise that comes intermittenly from the clock. I love this clock! I love the blue numbers, I love that they're big because I'm slowly going blind. I love the nap feature and the fact that the alarm slowly gets louder and louder. But what's up with the buzzing? How do I make that go away so I can use this clock?"
3,No way to adjust time manually,I have had this for about a month now. And it has little nuances like other users have stated. The alarm is plenty loud and gets louder over a thirty second period. So it's not blasting right away. The time however does not set automatically. It did when I first got it. I unplugged it today and the automatic time set keeps coming up as exactly ten minutes late. I've left it unplugged and everything. I'm on Amazon right now looking @ other alarms and suggest you do the same. Looks like the quality is hit or miss.
3,"If You Like Rice Crispies, Then This May be the Clock for You","I think Crackle, of Snap, Crackle and Pop manufactured this clock. This clock boasts and delivers on many of its useful features, and overall performance is excellent as advertised. However, after only 3 months of owning the clock, I noticed a subtle but very annoying crackling sound emitting from within the unit. Until all sources of power (i.e. battery back-up) were removed, the noise was still present, yet ever so subtly. I also feared the worst, that a poor connection or ground fault within the unit could possibly present a fire hazard. Two prevailing factors have compelled me to discard of this clock and not recommend it as a first choice for an alarm clock - 1.) Emitting a faint yet bothersome crackle and 2.) Doubts/concerns for safety while operating the clock.If you want to wake to the morning sounds of Rice Crispies in freshly poured milk, then this clock may satisfy your appetite."
1,VERY poorly made!,"I bought two of these...one for my son, one for my husband. BOTH of them broke!! The buttons stick and the only way to fix it is to take the clock apart...DO NOT BUY!!"
1,DON'T DO IT!!!!,"I chose this product hoping to be able to use it right after I gave birth. Unfortunately this was 5x wayyyyyy to small!! It sucks because I then had to return this item, and then wait for a new belly bandit to come. I would definately say pay a little more, and get the belly bandit! You will be much more satisfied."
4,"Very comfortable, a little to long in the back","I prefer this cincher over the squeem cincher, it is much more comfortable, although it does run big. I have a 30 inch waist, and fit a small perfectly, and still able to breathe. The back is 1-2 inches to long, and if you are wearing thin clothes you can see where it stops. Unlike squeem, I can make it through a 10 hour work day with ease. When I wore squeem, it really brought my waist in, Rago cinches your lower stomach also, without the buldge. I had a baby 3 months ago, and when I wear my cincher to work, everyone thinks my stomach is so flat."
4,Sizing is off,"i just got this in the mail and it looks great and I tried it under my clothes and it is so smooth and long enough to tuck beneath, however the sizing is off which is why I only gave it 4 stars. According to the chart I should be a L but when it came it fit just like a shirt, so comfortable that it really doesn't squeeze anything in so I probably need a Medium for it to act like a real cincher so I might be exchanging it."
1,Not Reliable,"I've had this for a few years and have had several occasions where the alarm doesn't go off because the unit experienced some sort of error when trying to read the CD. The display shows ""ERR"" or something similar which lets you know why you've overslept.If the intermittent failures weren't enough, now the clock is adjusting the time randomly (not the alarm time, but the display time). The time will adjust by 1 to 2 hours forward or backward with no known explanation. When this happens, only the hour changes, never the minutes. This has been going on for some time now and it's time for this unit to hit the trash."
3,Great for 18 months,"Great sound, easy access snooze button, 2 alarms, multi-color display. Now 18 months after the purchase, the CD door won't open (Ingrid Michaelson is stuck inside) and the AM signal/volume slowly ramps up and down at random. Now that I see that they are $30 at an Amazon partner, I debating whether I should just get another one or something else. I bought this one for less than $30 at as a substitute for one that was out of stock (since they charged me the out-of-stock's price), which was about $40 off back then."
4,Good product!,We purchased this product for our granddaughter as a Christmas gift. She needed a cd player that would read cd-r's. She was happy with out selection and so were we. The only concern I had was in packing. It arrived UPS and the box was dented in several areas. When I opened the box I saw the cd clock radio was in another box inside and that box had visible depressions as well. There was one piece of paper between the boxes but offered very little protection. I removed the cd player and it was in good working order. I would have appreciated a better job of packing it for shipment. No complaints about the cd player.
1,I Do Not Recommend This Product,"This pen is extremely uncomfortable to use. It has a fingergrip that actually interferes with holding the pen and writing with it. The fingergrip is 3/8"" shorter than the fingergrip on the uni-ball Grip, when measured from the point of the pens. It also has this odd tip that uni-ball uses on some of its pens. And it doesn't give a smooth, even line as you write. So, it cost me $10 to find out I hate the pen, plus I'm stuck with five pens I'll never use. I strongly recommend that you not buy this pen."
1,chance by chanel,"i have boughten this product online before and have never had any problems but this particular bottle did not smell at all like chanel chance, very disappointed"
4,Need a laugh,"I found it funny enough to buy 2 and give one to my sister. What did u do January 20,2009? As cold as Washington DC was they still had fun."
2,Keep Looking,"Although we didn't like the price tag, we made the investment in this stroller for our twins who had just outgrown their infant car seats and therefore their infant stroller. Our justification for the price was that it would last until they were out of a stroller. Not even remotely true.Initially it worked well. We never used the drink trays because as it's been said in many other reviews, they were worthless. As my kids got heavier though (they only weigh 20 lbs now so I'm not talking very heavy), the stroller became very difficult to turn. All side by side strollers will have issues with tight spaces however not being able to turn this easily resulted in me leaving many stores because I couldn't either get in through their tight doors or get around their shop.This stroller is absolutely not worth the money and I regret having spent any money on it. BabiesRUs won't take it back anymore so we are stuck with a $300 paper weight."
2,Not worth the money,"The basket drags on the ground and mine actually has a hole in it. The side opening latch popped off and we had to rig it to wotk with a screwdriver. It doesn't turn well, my kids have whiplash. They are close in weight (32 ans 25 lbs) but it is still hard to push to make the wheels turn straight. I will be buying a tandem stroller soon"
2,PICTURE PERFECT...just not perfect.,"The stroller had all the physical attributes I wanted in a stroller. I have a six month and 20 month old baby. The following features are why I purchased this beautiful stroller-5 pt harness-great basket space-cool color scheme-individal recline and canopyHowever, the 5 pt harness is detatchable by any active child. My 20 month old just had to wiggle to take it off. The stickers came off the first day. And the parent cup kept falling apart. The snack tray closure was not as sturdy as I thought it would be. And there was too much slack on the turn. It felt like there was delay, and for the price I expected it to be seamless."
2,Not worth the money,"This is one of the most expensive double strollers on the market. If someone had given it to me and I had not know the price, I would have thought it cost about $80. The brand stickers fell off within the first few days. The trays stopped latching properly after about 6 months. It is hard to push and feels flimsy. Also, it is extremely hard to open and close. The storage basket drags with just a little bit of weight, causing the fabric to tear. The cup holder won't hold a full cup--it will tilt down and spill all over you. Save your money!"
1,Don't waste your money!,"This is one of the worst pieces of equipment I have ever owned. I received one of these items as a gift. I was really excited until I tried to use it. There are absolutely no instructions - NONE. No operating instructions, no instructions for downloading music, for syncing, no instructions for changing the battery, which is required frequently, NOTHING!I went online to try to find some sort of instructional material and NO SUCH LUCK!This player is small, looks good and if you can figure out how to turn it on and use it the sound is decent but for the money I would purchase another product.By the way I use technology in my job so I am familiar with how various pieces of equipment function."
3,Not as good as it could have been. . .,"A rather disappointing collection of strips, I'm afraid, the chief problem being that many of the strips are taken from longer sequences of strips, but without the rest of the story! Thus, for example, we see Lucy telling Linus that a study of him and his blanket will be her school science project; but where's the rest of the story?Considering how much space is left empty on each page--half or more of each page instead is filled with lines to simulate notebook paper, and faces of Peanuts characters peeking out--it seems to me there is no reason this could not have been a much fuller collection.Classroom Peanuts, a hardcover collection of school related Peanuts strips, did the job much better."
4,IMPACT IS IMMINENT,SMASH YOUR BRAIN INTO A CHAOTIC DREAM MESS OF PURE THRASH METAL. I LIVE FOR ALBUMS LIKE THESE. I HAVE BEEN A METAL FAN SINCE 1984 AND I WISH THEY STILL MADE ALBUMS/BAND LIKE THIS ONE. YOU WILL NOT BE DISAPOINTED PURCHASING THIS ONE. EXODUS IS A TRUE THRASH CARNIVAL TO LISTEN TO! SO SMASH YOUR FACE IN IT!
3,Not really right to rate this season...,"I absolutely loved this series, but blu-ray is the only version I'm interested in after buying the regular DVD for Season One. Blu-ray version is so far superior, makes the regular DVD really disappointing to watch. The visual feast is really only done justice through Blu-ray.Having said that, I am not crazy about the idea of spending this much money! And, I am wondering if there will be any other Fourth Season in Blu-ray made available, or is this uncut version it?"
2,Series OK Streaming from amazon HORRIBLE,The series is what it is. You can't believe is a text book but is entertaining. The streaming is horrendous !! Keeps dropping every 2 min or less in most episodes! I troubleshot everything in my house and it is amazon's streaming the problem. I won't even finish the season is so frustrating to watch!!!!!
3,Quick Reference,The book is just what it advertised. It's a good quick reference book with a few explanations.
2,I don't recommend buying this,"The 9 piece set was disappointing when i first got it and saw it up close. I did not know that the action figures were going to be that small. Aragorn, Legolas, Gimli, etc. are a little taller than 2 inches while the hobbits are about 1.5 inches tall. Well that wouldn't have bothered me that much if the painting on the faces of the figures was well done but it wasn't. Half of Frodo's face looks disfigured and he and the rest of the figures are not very bendable or posable.Save your money for something better and don't buy this. I'm probably going to return mine.Well i hope this review helps someone out."
1,Not Pilot's best product,"I'm going to go out on a limb and go against the other two reviews on this pen.I find it distinctly uncomfertable to write with, the little circular bands (that u can see at the bottom of the pen) where you grip to write are rough on fingertips. If you need to do alot of writing, this is not the pen for you.However on the plus side,the ink is a bright color that takes a long time to fade."
5,Good quality for the price,I am not in the medical field .. bought this for home monitoring. I was impressed with the quality of the unit for the cost. Read many other good reviews of the unit before making my decision.MRiddle
1,HUGE!!!!,I ordered this cuff for my son who needs his blood pressure taken on his thigh. He is 6ft3inches and the cuff was so big we couldn't get aan accurate reading and it was a large! I wonder what an extra large would look like! Sending it back.
4,a great golf guide,I felt that this was a golf book that I could use to actually improve my golf game. I refer to this book quite often and it has really helped me improve my game tremendously.
