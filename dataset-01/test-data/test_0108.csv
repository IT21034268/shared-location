1,"The idea is good, the cost outrageous","I saw these and thought they were a good idea, so I went to the local hardware store, found two damaged granite tiles which the hardware store cut in half for me and marked down because they were damaged. I ended up with four chin chillers for less than $2."
3,"Chin loves to ""chill"" on it",My chinchilla has one of these in his cage and he loves to sit on it all day. It's easy to clean. My only complaint is the cost of these things. I went for my second chin to a home supply chain and bought a single marble tile almost 3 times the size of this one for about half the cost.
4,Could live without,"I gave this product a 4-star because I think my chins could do without this. Although it's still feels like winter here, my chins really don't care for this stone. I'm hoping they will decide to use it in the summer, but still have my doubts.Wanted to update this review! I am still leaving it at 4-stars but wanted to let you all know that my chinchillas have decided they love this stone! I placed it inside one of their houses and they sleep on it every day! I actually purchased another one because since it is becoming summer I keep one in the freezer and change them out to keep my chins cool!"
4,"Lucid, Logical, & Sometimes Lovely","Rabinowitz's thesis is straightfoward: that the Old Testament is rooted in an older (vegetative, cyclical) world-view. The One true God of Judaism is a product of an evolutionary process consisting in the absorption of Canaanite gods Baal, El, & Asherah.I disagree with an earlier review, which found the academic gestures of ""The Faces of God"" overdone. They're part of the appeal of Rabinowitz's discipline. There's poetry in his scholarship."
2,confusing,I read this book for a mythology class. My class and I have come to the conclusion that Mr Rabinowitz uses confusing phrases and large words to make himself sound more intelligent. There are some very unique ideas but he didn't do a very good job writing them up.
5,A trip to Jamaica in your hands!,I haven't put this book down since it arrived in the mail! You will love 'meeting' several Rastas and hear their personal philosophies which are each unique and yet all based on One Love. Learn why Ital (natural and/or organic) foods and herbs are soooo important. Sychronicity happens!
3,1st Treat Her Right LP,"Not as consistently good as 'Tied To The Tracks', but has its moments. Price has gone WAY UP since I purchased."
5,Add this and the Seven Little Foys...,"Add this and the movie ""Seven Little Foys"" starring Bob Hope with a special appearance by James Cagney in his continuing role as George M. Cohan and you have the best movie set ever made! My father bought me Yankee Doodle Dandy many years ago when it first came out colorized and I have watched it over and over and never tire of it or the music."
5,One of Cagney's Best,"Great production, songs and of couse, story. Jimmy Gagney was fantastic. One of the best movies ever. Yankee Doddle Dandy should be a part of every classic movie collection."
5,james cagney is electric,"JAMES CAGNEY'S performance as George M. Cohan is a singular achievment in motion picture history. He combines his formidable acting skill with a quirky song-and-dance style to deliver an unashamedly exuberant performance so full of joy and swagger that forgotten in the euphoria is how briddled the movie is by its unfortunate adherence to the standard bio-pic format of the time--overindulgent sentimentality, laborious plot turns, ""corny"" dialogue, shallow interpretation of characters, etc...--however, this is Cagney's movie. His dynamic performance is beyond reproach and obscures any criticism made about the film as a whole."
1,What a Joke!,"Well, joke is not the right term. Sickening would be better. This book is filled with nonsense and non-facts about the Catholic Church, both the history , teachings, doctrine and bible. It is horrible that so many snippets are conveyed by trash like this, and then re-quoted in other publications. I read two chapters and felt sick. I will pray for his spirit as he undoubtedly has led people astray and will have to answer for that..."
1,Father Knows...Not Much,"""Father Knows"" is--simply put--awful. Toby Ross, former adult film director, takes a stab at mainstream and misses the mark by a very wide margin. Supposedly about relationships (I guess; I couldn't really tell), the characters are as cardboard as they come--along with the acting. If ANYONE can believe the ""friend"" could channel Zelda Reubenstein, then they could also believe that I'm Brad Pitt's body double. Characters come and go, have little substance to them, and add nothing to this movie. Poignant, heart-tugging: ARE YOU KIDDING ME?Although listed as 74 minutes long, you'll swear you've just sat through a double feature. This movie is unrated and has some nudity and language...and that's about all it has."
1,I don't get it,"Bad acting, writing, and film quality. Watch the movie Shelter*****, Latter Days*****; The Trip****; Boy Culture****; Rock Haven****; even Coffee Date***. These directors, producers, and Actors have brains, and it shows in their work. Even though you have a small budget, just keep true to the story. It will be enough to carry us through to the end."
1,"very elementary, not for the serious decorator","This book is best for the very basic ""do it yourself person"". Not for the serious home decorator. Designs are almost childish. I should have spent my money elsewhere."
2,Outdated and uninteresting,"This book was originally published in 1975 and I think it shows. I realize it's a product of its time but some of the racism and sexism is a bit jarring (for instance, a detective says that ""all Chinese look the same to a Dutchman"" and, later on, two of them muse that a girl who'd been molested had it coming as she was wearing short shorts). Such comments are dropped casually, not as though the author intended to show flaws in his characters.The story itself plods along with very few surprises and I didn't find it particularly rich in ""Dutchness,"" either. I can appreciate a good, slow story, don't get me wrong. This one is not even so much slow as it is simply boring. By the way, someone should have told him that when it comes to hanging people, the past tense is ""hanged,"" not ""hung."""
2,Not worth it! even at gold box prices,"why but 2 movies you dont want when you could buy a collectors edition terminator blu-ray movie for less?terminator is by far the best movie of the set. even 25 years later it has held up nicely even the stop motion effects of the evil robot are acceptable and add to the charm of this classic sci fi film. but for $30 you could get a collectors addition with mulitple discs that include commentaries and making of features that you would enjoy much much more than the day after tommorow and I, robotalso the gold box price is still $29 thats about the same deal you will get at costco or target so dont be in a rush to grab this ""deal"""
5,Simply wonderful,"This may be the best Maeve Binchy I've read yet. The story and characters are so well developed that you feel as though you live right there in Mountfern in the 60s. You know everyone intimately, as you do in all of Binchy's books, and you truly rejoice or mourn when something happens to any character.The only thing left to say is thank goodness there are plenty more books by Binchy that I have yet to read!!!"
1,Can't stay awake for this one,"I've read and enjoyed ""Tara Road,"" ""The Lilac Bus,"" and ""Dublin Four"" so I was looking forward to ""Firefly Summer."" What a disappointment. It drags on and on, and her 1960's American children are using phrases that may have been common to Irish kids, but when the Americans used them (the brother wanted to compliment his sister by ""marking her card."" What???), it made the whole story seem unfathomable and unbelievable for me. It ruined the whole thing. Now, at Chapter 10, I could care less what happens to these people. I don't have to worry about not being able to put this one down, it usually falls out of my hands as I'm dozing off."
2,Very long and slow!,It was about page 225 before something happened and then it just ended at 600+. I usually like a long book but this one was a bit of a slog. I kept reading expecting 'more' but it never happened.
3,Good info... Just out dated,"Good book. But there isn't anything in it that is focussing on INDOOR HIGH YIELD at all. It has black and white photos, very few useful colorful photos. Same as the book marijuana growers handbook by ed rosenthal just an older version ."
4,One of the better ones,"I read 90% of this book front to back when I first recieved it. It could have been organized better, and yes it did seem to jump around a bit, but it had some quality information that are the building blocks for the best techniques available."
1,Sybex Solaris 9 Certified System Administrator Study Guide,"This book has numerous errors in it. I'm not sure what sort of QC process Sybex uses, if any. I would certainly recommend one of the other Solaris study guides."
1,The Awful Awful,"Coping with manic depression personally, I returned this to my library perhaps half read.......I just couldn't subject myself to finishing this book, or perhaps, manic induced journal entries is more accurate. I think so, I have plenty of them to refer to of my own.....Knowing what manic episodes are and how they affect me I felt my 'mental' ''illness', when it occurs, was totally incited by reading this book, which I am sure was not Carrie's intentions.I am sure her intention was making tons of money by having it published which I assume she accomplished. Bully for her as she needs it for her shock treatments and meds, none of which I can afford. Perhaps I am better off.....For me, Carrie at her Best, was the clip of her on you-tube speaking at George Lucas' AFI Life Achievement Award. Pants Peeing HILARIOUS..... THAT IS MEDICINE we manics need, not this awful awful."
2,I really wanted to like this book,"But I didn't. The best(?) parts are the passages where Fisher describes her altar ego's crackup/meltdown/breakdown. But I have to agree with an earlier reviewer who said that if she had not been who she is this would never have seen the light of day. I can't believe there was an editor on this thing: it's disjointed, confused, rambling, and generally, overall, not very well done. Yet, there are lines in this book that are sheer poetry, but you've got to make your way through so much junk to get to them that it's hardly worth the effort."
2,The title has it half-right...,"Like its protagonist, this book tries way too hard and, despite sparks of vibrancy, drives you away. Suzanne Vale's endless witticisms are supposed to become obnoxious, which they do, but I think they're still supposed to be clever enough to be admired, which they're not. And Fisher is fundamentally unable to write dialogue for a straight man. (A hardened ex-con tattoo artist who's gotten abusive with Suzanne while scoring drugs in Tijuana calls her a ""dizzy brat""?!)"
3,"always witty, that Carrie Fisher","This book was well written. Boy can she turn a phrase, in a way that makes you smile and maybe laugh, even as she's using her gift for language to describe coming apart at the seems, getting herself in real trouble in Mexico, or being committed to a psych ward. I wasn't always all that interested in the plot, but I was always interested in the words she chose to describe things and her (remember that Suzanne is her ficitonalized alter ego) reactions to them.I beg to differ with at least one of the other reviews. THis is not a polemic against pharmachological treatments for mental illness. She's not the one that got away from the psychiatrists. In fact, it's going off her treatment that sends her spiraling out of control. She's pretty upfront about that. This is one of those times when the reviews say more to me about the reviewers than the reviewed. At least I'm upfront about my bias in favor of pithy writing."
4,Nice product,"Great product at a great price. Sometimes the buttons do not work perfectly but trying a couple of times, always work. I do not hesitate to buy it again!"
2,Nice features - if they worked,"Feature set is very appealing, quiet fan, automatic humidistat, carbon filters, air ionizer. Unfortunately the automatic humidistat is flawed, we returned it and got a new one and it still has the same problem. When it reaches the desired humidity it shuts off - but then if it instantly ducks below that number it instantly turns back on - and off - and on...you get the picture. Imagine having a machine in your room that turns on and off 10+ times a minute - not conducive for sleep.Other than this fatal flaw it works great. It humidifies better than any of our other humidifiers, its quiet and easy to clean. If the above mentioned feature worked this would be a kick butt humidifier - but it doesn't. For the record, we have a Honeywell humidifier of the same size and with an automatic humidistat that doesn't have the same problem - we believe it's because the humidistat is more accurate and it has a built in 5% tolerance."
3,Damaged goods,"This item is a damaged item when i received.The inside plastic part was broken. Thought writing and following up on refund is bigger task than purchasing. I have not yet started using this item, though i rated this as it is a manadatory field on the screen."
4,The South Represented,"I've honestly only listened to one song on this cd. I personally don't like Bleek's style. But I'm from the South & I'm LOVING the song 'Round Here' w/ Bleek, TI, & Trick Daddy. From 'skimming' thru the cd, it pretty much sounds like his previous cds. I agree w/ some of the other reviews, that the beats on this album are better, but lyrically he hasnt improved. Maybe if I take the time to listen, I'll find more than one song to like.... maybe."
2,well...,"i admit, i liked bleek...and i thought that he had potential to really be a solid artist...but this to me is another failed attempt at roc-super-stardom. perhaps jay built his ego up too much so the only thing he could do was fail. who knows.on to the album...beats are suspect, bleek's rhyme style doesn't really blend with them as well. best song is hypnotic, with sigel and jay-z. round here and we ballin' are solid, but the album gets too poignant, too sappy for my taste...he should have had 1 or 2 songs on all of that and left it alone."
3,3 ONLY beacuse a fellow fan,I have to say that there are ONLY a couple of good tracks on this disk. In my opinion Bleeks' album sucks.
3,It's Aight,"This is Memph's best CD to date. I feel he is improving. but he's still far from fillin Jigga's shoes. Stand out tracks include ""Hipnotic"" and ""Do It All Again"" and the intro (inspired by GOODFELLA'S....(tite, tite). Memph's aite but.....the future of the Roc is.......KANYE WEST (cop College Dropout when it hits stores 2004)"
2,"Good concept, but little imagination in the writing","This book had potential, but it was poorly written in my opinion. A little imagination & intelligence goes a long way. I can't tell you how many times bland adjectives like ""little"" & ""big"" were used to describe mundane things, making them seem more mundane instead of bringing them to life. Somewhat cliched."
2,Good premise; little insight,"The book had a good premise, but Deveraux did little to develop a promising beginning. I have never read her before, so perhaps most of her stuff is not too thoughtful? I think she is a mediocre writer at best. Once again, men are sited as the reason for all of women's ails and the panacea for our wounds."
4,Best Jude Deveraux since A Knight in Shining Armor,"I got this book in the mail on Wednesday and was up until 2 in the morning finishing it! What a great story concept.... what would YOU do if you had the chance to go back and make a different choice in your life? ""The Summerhouse"" is just what I look for in a book, good characters and a plot line that is a little out of the ordinary."
3,"Not her best, but not the worst","I've read a lot of romance and almost all of Jude Deveraux's books. Like all of Deveraux's books, this one is a cut above your usual romance (she doesn't get her plots from a can). However, it is not Deveraux's best.This book is worth reading. It wasn't terrible. It kept me turning pages for two days, but in the end I was waiting to get more out of the book and suddenly it was over.The good part of the book was that it was an easy read with imperfect characters (something that I always like to see). It wasn't totally predictable, but seemed a bit contrived here and there. The bad part was that it was more about friendship than romance (in fact, the male characters you get to know best are the bad ones).So - Read it, but don't expect the world."
3,A good idea...but...,"I agree this book is a great concept and I really enjoy all the cast and characters involved except for one. The Heroine or rather Libby. I understand she is bitter over her failed relationship and is now raising her sweet son on her own. But I found the extent to which she holds on to her bitterness really hard to take. I truly don't know how the hero, Declan holds his attraction to her when she is constantly undermining and berating him. At 3/4th through this book I had yet to see Libby's attitude evolve and show any level of growth towards understanding. I find her character extremely frustrating and that is why I can only give this book 3 stars... The romance is just too one sided...and Libby is too unforgiving."
3,Disappointing for the price,"I was taken aback when I opened up this dictionary: it's organized by the Japanese kana system (a-i-u-e-o) rather than by the roman-ji ABC, so it certainly is not for the beginning student. However, any student advanced enough to look up a Japanese word in its kana version is not going to be satisfied with this volume. There aren't that many entries, the definitions and kanji versions of each word are not that comprehensive, and the typeface is so fine it requires a good magnifying glass (or a well-trained squint) to read. The problem, I suspect, is that this book is actually a translation of a dictionary written for ""juniors,"" elementary school-aged students. The vocabulary level is too simple for the older or adult student. If you're looking for a real Japanese-English dictionary to invest in, try NTC's New Japanese-English Character Dictionary, edited by the witty, erudite Jack Halpern."
4,Not wolf hoffman this time,"probably the best u.d.o dirkscheider album 1987 i like to hear the songs WE WANT IT LOUD , WARRIOR it Rocks"
4,Understanding Venezuelan literature,"When I was in my teens I had to read this book from Uslar Pietri as ""homework"". The man is a genious storyteller. The way the characters come to life in this novela touches every fiber of your heart. To undesrtand Venezuela is to understand his/her writers, what best example of a venezuelan masterpiece with ""Lanzas Coloradas"".It is a detailed account of the Venezuela already gone and past during the time of the colonies. Is a description of the liberating efforts of Simon Bolivar during the tumultuos years of Independence.A must read."
5,Nice scratch and sniff book,"This is a nice scratch and sniff book with bright, colorful illustrations and good scents. It seems to have a lot of pages for a board book, so good value. As with all scratch and sniff books: you just can't scratch too hard!!"
4,binding fell apart,"Have made about ten recipes from the book and all were excellent. I plan to make many more, however, the pages started falling out after only a week or so. For me, the contents are worth the inconvenience."
4,BBQ,Great book with lots of multicultural recipes. Giving it to kids for Christmas present. They might like it I found it interesting
5,Too Good for Words,I have traveled in the Far East a great deal with the US Navy. I can now make some of the delicious recipes from Singapore and Thailand that I have up to now had to forget. This easy to read cook book is a must for anyone who loves indoor or outdoor grilling and is great for inspiration. Sates have become a staple at our house. The fresh fish is next.
4,Good way to try some new grilling ideas.,Many new styles that I have never tried or created. Can't wait to put the fire to some of them.
2,I don't think so,Great if you want recipes from around the world with ingredients that can't be found. It seems to me that the author was trying to make a statement more of his travels than of his culinary acummen. I'll relagate this one to the bookcase.
3,Too In-Your-Face,"I'm disappointed in this book for two reasons. First, there's very little white space on any page, so no page looks or feels restful or inviting. Everything is in-your-face boldfaced type, with very narrow margins. I don't like to look at the pages of this book, so I can't really find a recipe that appeals to me because I feel as if the author is shouting at me through the boldfaced type. Second, there are over 500 recipes in this book: this feels like way too many. I don't find the book user-friendly. Still, I keep it around for occasional reference, mainly for the ""how to grill perfect _______"" advice that accompanies fish, chicken, beef, etc."
2,Too many ingredients,"If you like a cookbook that requires you to have multiple ingredients per recipe, this book is for you. I like cookbooks that have useable recipes from things I probably have already in my home. This cookbook is too complicated. Just to make their ""Basic Barbecue Sauce"", you need to have 19 ingredients. I would rather pay 99 cents and buy it at the store. I was truly disappointed with this book. I bought it for my husband and it has sat in the cupboard."
3,Too few photos,"The text part is great, but I was very disappointed that there are so few photos in the book. I would not have bought if I had known that."
4,Not for my personal use.,"this item was not for my personal use. It was purchased as part of a gift basket for a charity auction. Just thumbing through it, ti seemed to be pretty impressive. The basket fetched a nice for the auction so someone else must have been impressed too."
5,Another stunner,"Cordero's 2nd release (via Daemon) outshines Lamb Lost in the City. The songs are crisper, dancing on the border of rock with only a few jaunts toward the ballad end of the spectrum. The weaving of the tracks beckons you to get up and just move with the rhythm. This band is able to successfully cross the bilingual barriers and offer what can only be summed up as a very solid CD."
2,I really wanted to love this shredder,"I've been using this shredder for a year now and while I love the way it can turn any paper into dust, the fact that it can only handle a few pages at a time has been driving me crazy. First the good- it's large, has a huge pull-out bin, and shreds paper into nothingness. The bad- this thing is a total baby when it comes to shredding more than 3-4 pieces of paper. I've tried heavy and light paper and regardless, the sensor on this unit refuses to go over 5 pages most days. The box is completely misleading when it says 10-sheet and the majority of the time you can only send a few. I've spent countless amount of time feeding and re-feeding the shredder.I really want to love this shredder but one year later I'm sick of it. It's a frustrating experience to be only able to send a few pages into what appears to be a heavy duty unit."
4,"Nice little addition, but wish it came free.","I was a bit hesitant to buy this product since I've read good and bad things about it. I took my chance and bought it anyways, and I'm glad I did. You would think the stroller would include this accessory since it's so expensive, but unfortunately it doesn't. I really needed a place to put my coffee or cell phone when going for a walk in the morning. I placed it on the inside so it wouldn't stick out, and I haven't had any problems with it getting in the way. Every once in a while I'll take it off if I know I'm not going to use it."
4,"Helpful, but expensive","The Bugaboo cup holder was a great, and much needed addition to our Chameleon stroller. It's wide enough and sturdy enough for a hot cup of coffee and can even serve as a cell phone holder, but the price? The price was outrageous for the product. There are several alternatives out there, including some lesser-known brands at BRU, and had I known about those before, I would have bought one of those instead for half of the price.However, shipping was quick and the product arrived neatly packaged in it's original box with all of the parts. Assembly was easy and all parts are included for each type of stroller in the Bugaboo line. Putting the cup holder on was also a breeze and removing it can be a bit difficult."
2,Never stays on,This cup holder never stays on. Even with exchanging the parts and size pieces it comes with. I'd rather hold my drink than fight with this.
3,Good Starter Set,It's not the best kit in the world but it's good for beginners. I used to have this for 5 years but then I upgraded to the ddrum Dominion Maple (in lime green) which made it awesome.
4,Midsummer Night's Dream,I bought this CD because I love classical music and wanted to try a new artist. I love every song on the CD. The music is relaxing as well as just plain pleasant to listen to.
1,ugh,just didn't do it for me. I barely got thru chapter 1 before I ran to half price books. Glad I didn't buy it new.
2,Pretty poor even if you live in the US,Despite the title this is almost entirely about the US and its' near neighbours. Europe and Asia get a cursory glance. The resort coverage itself is sparse and there are few illustrations.
1,abject waste of time,"This book is unintelligible and I truly doubt that one would be ""way ahead"" of the intellectuals to understand 30% of it. Kristeva needs to tone down the effusive gibberish. The only parts I found interesting and accessible were her literary analyses. But, indeed, I would call this work pseudo-philosophy."
2,English suspense,"Although Frances McDormand's performance is outstanding, it is poor plot and uninspiring. Verty difficult to pay attention for the entire movie."
3,Good film with good performances,"This was a good thriller with (from a Brits perspective) a rather frightening story line. It does however make me laugh that if such a film were made against US injustices eg. Camp X-Ray they would be labelled un-american, and yet the British audience didn't take such offence at this one."
5,Hidden Agenda,"This is a tell it like it was and unfortunately still is in Northern Irelan in this year 2007. It shows the power a a dominating goverment and how they will not let go and how so many suffer because of a political agenda, which is ""HIDDEN------SlainteDonal Murphy II"
2,Dullsville,This book did not hold my interest at all. A little S&M not even done in a manner to be arousing to me.
1,Jensen on the radio,I heard Jensen on a local radio show promoting this book. The host said it was well-written and compelling. All I got from Jensen's time on the show was how he hated America. Jensen thinks being a patriotic American is wrong. Jensen had nothing positive to say about these United States. His premise seemed to be about America being so wrong and hurtful to the world it was without praise. I'm an educated man and I understand the base that his arguments stem from. I don't have to agree with those arguments and I will never agree to his conclusions. America is not a monster.
2,"More Pop Psycho-Bable, blah blah","Sorry Jake, no dice, just alot of hype about I can do it, etc. While I have made some lifestyle changes I want to make, I have more to go, and this didn't help, I still am no more motivated to lose the 10 pounds than when I started your book."
2,My emotional Rollercoaster,"The stories in Chicken Soup for the Girlfriends Soul took me on a very high and low emotional rollercoaster. The stories made me smile and some made me sad. I didn't particullarily like this book because I think that it was directed to an older audience. I am 15 years old, and some of the stories were about life-long friendships. I couldn't seem to relate to many of the stories. Overall, this book wasn't my favorite, but it wasn't the worst book I have ever read."
2,Read the details..,"I have no one to blame but myself for NOT reading the description! I got this as a stocking stuffer for my mom (she had read about this movie and really wanted it).. it does NOT work in regular dvd players. Price was great, just wish my stupid-self read everything :p"
5,Excellent body shaper,"I have worn this body shaper for years and found it to be the most comfortable and the most body sculpting of any I have worn.I wear lots of party clothes, and this pulls my waist in and makes my figure look great. I will never wear those spandex stylesor any other style. Just love the lace body wear. I have purchased about 40, both black and white, over the past seven years. Please bring it back. I need more!"
2,Can not wear with anything low cut,"I ordered this expecting to be able to wear it to a nice dinner. The only problem is, I CAN'T WEAR IT WITH HALF MY SHIRTS! Sure it holds me in fine, but wear it with a V-neck shirt and it peeks out all night. It even shows in a nice cowl-neck sweater."
1,Baaaad,"Dont bother with this one or any others from these guys.Crap music sound track over the top and the camera work is appaling.As soon as something is looking good the guy seems to want to annoy the viewer by moving away or just movig arround so fast you can not see anything.Save your money and get one of the ""gone wild"" dvds. Much better and hotter content."
2,No lyrics attached... be very careful...,Beautifully arranged.. but no lyrics sheet.. I have to download some of the lyrics over the net to enjoy the CD... no regrets however.. The company should put an extra effort on their next venture... beware buyers... if you don't have the lyrics sheet.. it's impossible for you to cherish this cd..
5,clear language,"This book is much easier to understand than the other version of the Spiritual Exercises of St. Ignatius that I had previously read. The other version was written in such a convoluted manner that I had ""translated"" the rules of discernment into language that made sense to me. Thankfully, I had studied that previous version in a class with a very wise and learned person, who went to great pains to clarify the meanings. This version reminds me of the Rules of Discernment ""water into a sponge"" simile. It's easy to absorb and needs no explanation. I look forward to sharing it with my instructor. Peace."
4,Edited beautifully,"I had heard so much about the ""exercises of St. Ignatius"". I read the reviews and decided on this one because one of the comments made was that the reading could be difficult but this edition was put into understandable text. That is accurate. I must add also that the Preface by Avery Dulles, S.J. was excellent reading and inspirational all on it's own! The Chronology of the Life of St. Ignatius of Loyola included in the book gives definition to much of the Saint's life and times. I would definitely recommend this purchase."
3,Pawn of prophecy ( Belgarid ) By David Eddings,This was a book i had and lost.... The copy I recieved was in an alrite condition. It wasn't new so i didn't expect it to be pristine. Not bad considering!!!
3,Adequate Intro To The World and the Characters,"I agree with another reviewer who said this is a good book for young people as well as adults since it's pretty simple in it's plot and characters.I thought it was fine. Not great, but felt exactly like what is was; a somewhat expansive prologue to the other four books that follow. The story is hardly original to anyone who's read Tolkein, seen the movie adaptions, or attempted to slog through Robert Jordan's massive Wheel of Time series. However, the characters seem to be worth revisiting, and the nice thing about the series as opposed to Jordan's is that the story is finite in five books"
5,Read it young,"This is a great book for anyone of any age but the younger the reader is, the better. Any 10-12 year old will become immersed in the plot and feel that these characters are real. Any older reader will read it in amazement over the rich vocabulary and details. The best reason to read it young is because it will be harder for you to predict and therefore a more enjoyable read. Enjoy"
2,Poorly repackaged Tolkien,"This book is not only a blatant reworking of LOTR, it is not even enjoyable reading. Eddings' style is simplistic, the dialogue is rudimentary, the plot is predicatble and the characters are dull. Couple this with the obvious lack of originality and you have a pretty dismal reading experience here. I forced myself to finish the book and was glad to finally put it down. I don't recommend this book and was so unimpressed that I plan not to read any more of Eddings' work."
3,Not a Nobel-Prize...,"This series were bestsellers- I actually don't know how the books got there. I read all Belgariad books, there actually was some tension, some fun, some goose flesh - it wasn't a bad book at all, but it lacked depth. All characters were so simple, so very, very predictable. What surprised me most is the fact that there were simply no complots, and it was most of the time just Garion and his companions running around and slaying easily everything coming their way. It was too straight to be a great read - the evil never really seemd to be a challenge for the characters or just overwhelmingly powerful. Having read the first couple of books of the Wheel of Time or the Greenangel-Series I'd say that there are two different worlds: those were intricate and mysterious novels, this was a hero-comic in prose. However, it does not mean that you get bored while reading it."
5,"Heartwarming, action-packed, lifelike, and soulful.","I loved the characters in this story. As an introduction to a much longer tale, this book sets the stage for you to share in the journey of an extraordinary group of people. I could almost see their steps on the sand in front of me as I lay on the beach reading. There is a hint of mystery surrounding the companions of the young boy Garion as they steal away from his lifelong home in the dead of night. He is not sure what he and his Aunt Pol are in for as they are led away by the old storyteller man, whom Garion only knows as Mister Wolf. Garion only knows his life is going to change forever as he steps down the road, unknowingly, to find his destiny and change the world"
4,Lots of fun to read!,"David Eddings has written a truly entertaining series, which begins with the still-fresh and exciting Pawn of Prophecy. Sure, the characters are mostly one-dimensional, but they are memorable and fun. Yes, everyone makes witty comments whenever possible, but Eddings has a real gift for dialogue. Not recommended if you're looking for something to challenge the mind, but as sheer entertainment, no one beats David Eddings when he's at his best. In Pawn of Prophecy, Eddings deftly introduces most of the series' main characters, and he slowly eases his wide-eyed young hero Garion into a larger, more dangerous world. I read it as a junior-high student, and loved it. Now I recognize Eddings' faults, but I still tremendously enjoy this series."
5,A review of one of the best fantasy books ever written.,"This powerful beginning of a series which follows the quest in search of a magical object with compelling characters and wonderful sorcery is the first of five that will get your heart pumping with the excitement that culminates in the following books until you no longer live on this earth, but in the amazing and mystifying world that David Eddings creates: Pawn of Prophecy, Queen of Sorcery, Magician's Gambit, Castle of Wizardry, and finally it all comes down to Enchanter's End Game. I hope you read every single book in this series, because if you don't, you will be missing out on something truly magical."
2,Lack of decent Villians and weak in its exercution.,I find most of Eddings work a continuous rehash of the same story that's OK because many of todays authors do it. Sadly like many of todays authors the story is weak and the characterisation even worse. We are introduced to Garion a young boy who's destiny is one that will shake the world of men and gods. Sounds good but then it's down hill from there Eddings seems to be incapable of giving his Heroes decent villians to combat so much so that there is no doubt they will succeed. I also found his attempts of humour quite sad. I rate his books down there with that other original writer Dennis L McKiernan.
4,Just to correct the previous reviewer.,This game is a remake it came out on the ill fated Sega Saturn in 1996.
2,disappointment to Lunar,"I'm an old game junky, and the Lunar games were defiantly one of the best. So when I saw that a new Lunar game was released, after years of fricking waiting and hoping, I flipped. The saying not to judge a book by it cover has never held as much truth as with this game. It looked like so much fun, but what I brought was a portal to hell. I'm sure many others have said this but I need to say the battle system was beyond frustrating and caused so many headaches. What were they thinking? Add to it that you have to choose between items or experience, this is not fun! The story was weak and random throughout the game, characters disappearing at times to never return with equiped items, and a horrible ending.The only good parts of this game was character designs and sound. Not enough to go through this horribly made game. Seriously, not even FF:Crystals was this bad."
1,"Oh, Lunar. Where for art thou?","I am decimated by the failure of this game to live-up to the proud legacy, which is Lunar.Music is fine, and while the graphics are essentially GBA enhanced moderately, the physical attributes are acceptable. However, the story is somewhat mediocre, but still passable.However, the mental requirements necessary to play this game are absent.A strategic battle system is non-existent. Attack, use a spell, or use an item with no selection as to which enemy to attack. Aside from the lack of the Lunar renowned semi-tactical battle, there is so little input required, that the game is downright awful.Truly, a lack of exercise in futility!"
1,The Right Wing Loves This Book!,"Christmas seems to get bigger and bigger every year. More sales, more celebrations, more TV commercials, more everything. Of course, this is not what Christmas is about at all, but it's what it has become. I would personally prefer a retreat from the mass consumerism that has replaced the celebration of birth of Christ. But, if you right-wing nutjobs want to go on about how Liberals are stealing your Christmas, then I suggest you just continue with this crap. You're not making any sense, and you sound idiotic. You will only be tolerated for so long by the normal folks out there."
1,"whether you like it or not, you have to admit...",Gibson is a true Field Marhsall for Baby Jesus.word.
1,A larger problem.,"It's not liberals who are screwing up Christmas, it's not conservatives, it the idiots who have to politicize (and thus, make even worse) what was a horrible ""holiday"" to begin with. I haven't read this book, and neither should you. Christmas should be beyond politics - left or right, just buy CD's for gifts and move on with your life."
1,Is this a joke?,"Does this guy really believe this stuff? Maybe all of us put upon Christians should get dressed in our best sweat shop clothes, get in our SUVs and drive past all the homeless people and start having ""Our best life now""! John Gibson is a selfish moron."
1,Oh those poor oppressed Christians. GIVE ME A BREAK!,"It's time crybabies like Gibson grow the hell up and get a life! The right wingnut fundies are getting real desperate in making up outlandish hate speech towards this holiday. All they are devoted to is their capitalist greed on the backs of third world child labor. Yeah, that's what the season's all about. Surely these fat lazy pigs can find something better to do with their time instead of living their hypocritical life of excessive indulgence.I'd tell you to donate your book profits to charity, but from these reviews it's obvious no one's buying it."
3,"The point was good, could have been told better...","The point of the book was good. While there actually isn't a ""war on Christmas"", much has changed as far as what people can do and say about the Christmas holiday over the years...and that was pretty much the point. Gibson was pointing out how those who celebrate Christmas (most of the US) cannot celebrate it as they once did, due to the rights for those who do not that are now in place.This book can get a little boring, but the stories are all true and do support the point he was trying to make. Christmas Trees are now ""Holiday Trees"", certain lawn decorations are not permitted, etc...which I do feel is a bit insane. The book was OK, but tends to bore you sometimes. The stories go into so much detail and background, which isn't really necessary. While I agree with the author and find the stories to be pretty surprising, I wouldn't rush to buy the book, only because you can read a lenghty summary and pretty much get the idea."
1,A nice holiday present for Gibson,Don't blame John Gibson for writing this nonsense. Blame the people who buy it. He has as much right making a buck off dumb fools as anybody..
1,"Not that I'm a betting man, but...",Who's taking bets that John Gibson isn't even a practicing Christian?
1,The Sky is Falling!!!,The folks at Fox News have mastered the old evangelical trick of fleecing people of their money through fear. The world is coming to an end and only (insert demagogue here) has the answer. This book is every bit as ridiculous as you suspect it is. Don't waste your money.
1,Self indulgent tripe.,"Got this book from the library cause I didn't want any of my hard earned money to go to Mr. Gibson and his fair and balanced lifestyle.Ugh. Rich white people complaining about being opressed. Let's be honest about what Christmas really means. Cranking the money making machine so we can all have the junk we don't need and the economy can live through another year of government spending. Christmas stopped being about Jesus with the advent of television, marketing, Xmas sales, and new cars in commercials with ribbons tied on their hoods. Christmas isn't being stolen by other religions, it's already been stolen by greed."
1,Gibson=Whining Girl,"John Gibson is a whiner. First he writes a book about how non-Christians are apparently destroying Christmas, nevermind the fact that non-Christians are now celebrating Christmas, like my half-Jewish family, for instance. Christmas is a part of our culture, everyone knows about it and respects it. The same can't be said for Kwanzaa, Ramadan, or even Hanukah, which people assume is just the Jewish Christmas. Christmas doesn't need protecting, unless it means protection from the rampant materialism that denigrates the holiday and makes all Christians look like iPod-crazy sellouts.And John, do you realize how lame it is that you're actually reading these stupid Amazon reviews AND criticizing them on your show? You're a real whiner."
1,More Smoke and Mirrors,"It is truly sad that not only were the reasons for going to War on Iraq fabricated, but now an entire war is being fabricated. It is even sadder that our rights as U.S. Citizens are being wiped out secretly, while smoke & mirror issues such as this make the headlines. Need I remind you that this country was formed by those seeking religious freedoms? Need I remind you of the first article in the Bill of Rights:""Congress shall make no law respecting an establishment of religion, or prohibiting the free exercise thereof; or abridging the freedom of speech, or of the press; or the right of the people peaceably to assemble, and to petition the Government for a redress of grievances.""This right states in black & white that the establishment of Christmas Day as a Federal Holiday by law is wrong.This book seems to forget that U.S. Citizens have the right to not be christians and to not be bombarded by any specific religion."
1,The War on Christmas,"Proud Texan,I was wondering what happened to Himmler. Living large in the lone star state. BTW, there is no war. The book and the all the Fox ""News"" stories are just bait so you will watch.Merry ChristmasHappy ChanukahJoyous KwanzaHave a good Eid al-AdhaProsperous Winter SolsticeAn Enlightened Bodhi Day"
5,Excellent!,"Great book. I don't plan on being a professional cook, but this book has a lot of cooking techniques that I was interested in learning. Plus a lot of great recipes."
4,Janet Baker,Very good voice. She has given the best rendition of Elgar's Sea Pictures that I know of.
4,A Well-Rounded Tenor,"I heartly agree with the previous reviewer's comments.I've been lucky enough to own several of Mr. Franchi's albums, and saw him in person in the late 60's. My only complaints, and considering the shortage of his work on disc I shouldn't be picky, are about the sound quality on some of the selections and the lack of some of his definitive work. How could RCA have left off ""Someone Like You""? He introduced this Richard Rodgers/Steven Sondheim melody in the Broadway show ""Do I Hear A Waltz"", and absolutely nailed it. This CD gives us a taste of his vocal range and ability to sing all types of music. A great singer, and a great man, who was taken far too early in his life."
1,LOW Quality Cheap Plastic Broken Zipper Bag,"LOW quality CHEAP plastic bag for a unreasonable price. The zipper stuck in the beginning, then the bag rip/torn after used. The strong plastic/vinyle smell is really bad. If I am not in a hurry for my upcoming special day, I willdefinitely return the bag and buy from other seller. DON't waste your $$$ on this bag!!"
2,High school English at its Best,"The essential problem with this novel is that it is so poorly written. The author makes observations about the characters that don't make sense & remove the reader from the story, e.g., ""I yawned without knowing it."" Also, the mysterious Danilo comes across like a caricature of Dracula. If this novel had been written as a tongue in cheek comedy, it might have worked. I am astounded at the great reviews this book has received (and a bit suspicious of them)."
4,Practical Introduction to Black and White Photography,"The majority of the text concentrates it's efforts in educating the reader in the art of B&W photography. Color photography is briefly touched on at the book's end. The first half of the book deals with various camera systems, accessories, film choices, photograph visualization and film exposure. All of these topics are covered exceptionally well. The second half deals with the developing and printing process. If the prospective reader will not be involved in the developing and printing process then the Ansel Adams Book 1, ""The Camera"", and Book 2, ""The Negative"", may be better choices. However to receive the maximum benefit from the art of B&W photography one must eventually delve into the darkroom. The book details those processes equally well."
5,You Have To Be Silly Not To Pay Attention To Adams,Get this book. Adams knew extremely well what he was doing. It makes sense to learn from a supreme master!
2,Hmmm.....,"Without a complete description or the ability to zoom in on the picture I assumed these were sythetic fiber and that there was a very small thin ""brush"" in the kit. The brushes are natural fiber and the fibers break loose very easily. The twisted wire ends are just cut off, not smoothed or deburred, which could lead to scrathes on the inner bores of your equipment. The small very thin ""brush"" is actually just a wire. These brushes are all larger than I expected, the ""toothbrush"" is about 7.5"" long (for reference) and the smallest diameter brush is 7/16"" diameter, a little too big for many of the smaller orifices in most spray equipment. Not too expensive, but not what I was looking for."
2,This Might Not Be the Album You Want,"I purchased this album because I am a fan of the Last Poets. Upon listening to the samples provided by Amazon.com, I thought I was getting an album that would contain very similar content to the Last Poets: some great politically charged poetry, perhaps accompanied by some funky beats. However, when I listened to the whole CD, I was disappointed to find out that the vast majority of the tracks sound the most like ""Get Out of the Ghetto Blues."" If more of the tracks had the sound of the title track, this would be a five-star album, in my opinion. True, Scott-Heron has a lot of great social commentary throughout the album, but not in the form I had hoped for. I would take the Last Poets' album ""This Is Madness"" over this particular Scott-Heron album."
5,"One of the great protest records, and avant-garde to boot!","This is a unique and forward-thinking collection from the Godfather of Hip-Hop, Gil Scott-Heron. This record, produced by the jazz great Bob Thiele, is provocative, melodic, and urgent at the same time. Many of the tracks are nice, jazzy, hopeful jaunts (""When You Are Who You Are,"" ""I Think I'll Call It Morning""). Many are ahead-of-their-time hip-hop joints (the title track, ""Whitey on the Moon,"" ""Brother""). Yet the most powerful tracks are the mournful ballads (""Did You Hear What They Said?,"" ""Home Is Where The Hatred Is""). The entire album evokes all of the joys, pains and petitions of the black community. The work of Common, Mos Def, The Roots and Public Enemy, among others, contain clear echoes of Gil Scott-Heron's impressive work on this record.Imagine ""Nation of Millions,"" ""Songs in the Key of Life"" and ""A Love Supreme"" wrapped in one, and this record would fit the bill. Buy it."
3,Disappointing!,"Not nearly as exciting or as good a ""read"" as its predecessor, Night Sins. The story could have been told in half as many pages; it was too predictable. I'll think twice before trying another Tami Hoag book"
2,Overly long and boring,"I am 3/4 through this book and am only able to read about 10 pages before falling asleep. I don't find it suspenseful at all. It is very, very long and drawn out. Since I have nothing else to read right now I am going to finish it. I am somewhat interested in who committed the crimes so I will stick with it. I don't think I will pick up any of her other books though."
4,Good but long winded,"I enjoyed this book, my first Hoag read. Although I will say that I wanted to tell the heroin to get over herself several times throughout the book! She irritated me for some reason. Some parts of the legal drama were a little long winded, but overall the story was a good one, and the end a surprising twist. I'd recommend this read to a friend."
4,Excellent Ending! Vintage Hoag....,"I've been a Tami Hoag fan since the mid-nineties. While Night Sins left me somewhat unsatisfied, Guilty As Sin gripped me from the first chapter and held my attention all the way through. Even my guessing early the identity of the accomplice and the other ""secret"" relationship of the villain did not dilute this book. I could have done without the confusing prologue, however, the rest of this book hit the mark. Kudos to Ms Hoag for another excellent read. Her prose is almost lyrical in places, yet blends so seamlessly with the element of suspense. She is truly a master of the genre."
1,What a sin !,"I have just finished reading this book and the preceeding ""Night Sin"". In both books there are so very many characters carrying around so very much emotional bagage. Maybe they should go to the nearest airport and lose it,"
5,Leather at his best.,Leather has returned to his best. On a par with The Vets and Tunnel Rats.Good read that will keep reader's attention right to the final page.
1,Ripp off,I ordered a cd and got a cassette...Other then that shipping was fine but upset I didn't get what I asked for and never had a problem with this before
1,A waste of money,The parts come with absolutely NO directions and it would take an MIT graduate to figure how they go together and fit onto the copter skids. it's useless
1,Training Gear????,"Training Gear Set: BCP, BCPPThis item looked like it would help but it is very FRAGILE!! it broke trying to install on the helicopter landing gear!! then the clips that hold it on to the landing gear came off & were lost while trying to fly it in the grass!!! i wished that it worked BETTER!!!or just had worked without breaking or loosing parts!!"
1,Could not get into this book,"I gave up on this one after about 80 pages or so. I didn't care for the main character, and I found this story so boring that it just didn't matter to me what happened at the end. The author also uses a lot of medical terms that I didn't understand. If you're a Robin Cook or Tess Gerritsen fan, then don't bother with this book."
4,High Tyde,"Los Angeles-based quintet The Tyde have managed to avoid the perilous sophomore slump on ""Twice."" The album is chock-full of pop goodness from the first to the last drop, and easily surpasses the promise shown on ""Once,"" the band's debut. Singer/guitarist Darren Rademaker shows himself to be more than a mere '60s California rock disciple on tracks like the rousing ""Go Ask Yer Dad"" and the Lou Reed-ish ""Henry VIII."" Other standout tunes include ""Best Intentions"" and ""Crystal Canyons,"" both of which are dominated by swirling quasi-psychedelic keyboards. The band occasionally missteps: ""Takes a Lot of Tryin'"" suffers from an overdose of Santana, while the surfer's paradise of ""Shortboard City"" amounts to a Beach Boys novelty tune. Overall, however, this is a fine album that will retain its playability when the summer turns to fall."
5,The 21th century Callas,"Though she's very original and proud of it, Gheorghiu is really the new Callas; she can sing anything, with a superb sense of stage and style, a warm and beautiful voice with a strong technique based on the very Bel Canto italian school.The highest results are obtained with Charpentier's Louise, Puccini's Liù and Bellini's Norma.At least a true opera star, and also a Beauty. I'm looking forward to her next concert to be captured in dvd.Buy it !!!!"
5,Quick and Easy to put together!,"The toy box was packaged nice. It was quick and easy to put together. I think it took maybe 30 minutes, at the most to put together. I really love that it has the safety hinges."
4,Good Product,"I had trouble finding a true ""brushed chrome"" cover and bought others previous to this that were too shiny, this works good and is not as shiny. My only compaint is that a small amount of water still pools up at the bottom of the tub, but that is a minor issue."
5,great new singer,What an awesome voice! Holly Brook growls and purrs and rocks. I was impressed by the diversity of moods and the range of her voice. I find myself reflecting on the lyrics while savoring the nuances of the melody. Great debut album.
5,One of my top five albums this year..........,"Holly Brook is such an awesome singer! Every song is written perfectly and Holly Brook has one amazing voice. If you haven't bought the album yet, go out and get it now."
2,ho hum,was a more a history lesson than a novel .... quit reading half way through... already knew the information wanted more of te personal connection with the artists
4,Great Read!,"I loved this book! Well executed and informative. A definite must read for lovers of art history. More of a secular history book rather than an art history discussion, however, it gives great background and understanding into how politics and the evolution of the world influenced and changed art in late nineteenth century France."
2,Where is the spirit?,"Like many readers, I loved Ross King's book on Brunelleschi's Dome and looked forward to this one. I was disappointed and did not finish ""The Judgment of Paris."" Crammed with needless details -- did we really need to know minute biographical data on the man who made the catalog for the 1863 salon? -- the book reads like one of its early chapter titles ""A Baffling Maze of Canvas."" Lost in the maze is the spirit of impressionism -- the bold, daring, and devoutly Bohemian characters who risked all for art. Manet, Monet and the rest come across here as dry, calculating tacticians. Their fierce devotion to art, their love of light, their passion for life and women and absinthe are drowned in the details of what bureaucrat or politician said what to whom and when."
5,Required reading for 19th century art lovers,"One of the easiest reading books I have read in a long time. King covers the Paris art scene, mid 19th century, describing infighting, jealousy between artists, and reviews of jury members for the Paris Salons, and more. He brings in incidents and historical facts that might appear unrelated to the subject, yet are so iportant for understanding hostilities and art of the time. For example, the top hat's introduction to society and Manet's depiction of the hat in his paintings. If you are interested in art of mid 19th century, this is delightful and informative reading."
4,Excellent cart for the money!,I did my research and decided to purchase this item due to the amount of positive reviews it has and I am not disappointed! It was very easy to assemble and seems very sturdy. The hanging bar is also very handy and is easy to adjust. The bags seem to be well made and should hold up well over time. I think this is the best laundry sorter you can get for your money so do not hesitate to buy this item!
5,Worth the price,"I bought one from target and it broke very easily, this one is strong and wider holds a lot more and you can hang clothing too I love it"
2,Broken,"The cart and bags are good overall, but the clamp that supports one of the poles cracked after 2 months."
4,Love it!,This is a great organizing solution. Only issue with it was one of the parts came cracked but it still works.
5,Perfect hamper.,"This hamper was exactly what I was looking for. The bags are exactly one load size for my washer and with 3 of them it's easy to sort my colors, whites and dry cleaning. The expendable bar is also very nice - room for plenty of shirts while I iron. I highly recommend it!"
5,Best Laundry Sorter I've Owned!,"I love this laundry sorter. It's really sturdy and the bags are heavy. I haven't had it long, but it seems like it was made to last. I've owned other PVC type sorters with mesh bags and this one is by far more sturdy and the casters are awesome! I have a large laundry room, so I've put them to the test. The only thing that would make this even better is if the hooks on the bags would secure into place as they do tend to come off the cart sometimes. Other than, I highly recommend!"
5,Seville Hanging Bar Laundry Sorter,I'm very pleased with this product. It's sturdy and allows me to be better organized; I can hang my clothes right from the dryer. I highly recommend it.
4,laundry,"I love this cart. I have back problems and cant lift anything. The main reason for purchasing this cart is to perserve some of my independence. The only thing i would change is i would like the top rack to be higher. When i hang long shirts that have been ironed, the bottoms hang in the baskets. Thats the only thing i would change. The wheelers are large and roll easily on carpet. I would recommend this product for anyone and it works great for disabled people..."
2,where can find the replace pieces?,"Overpricing for an item is just as negative a factor on a product as ""it brakes easily,"" and deserves to be negatively reviewed as such. Where we can find a replace for the plastic thing for joint the hanging bar for cloth?"
5,Something for the next century!,"Unfortunately KOTS started their career in the late 80`s and will always be compared to the l.a scene etc.But from my point of view this is genuine rock`n roll!I`m not talking ACDc,though they come from the same area,this is far better.Listening to black leather,tom boy and Serpentine there is no doubt that KOTS should be far more appericiated than they ever where.Sharp guitars,ok vocals and a fantastic pop-theft.This is the Stones of the late 80`s,early 90`s.They have influenced my childhood,and will continue that way!..""LP OG KJP"""
3,"Nice colorful set, but don't machine wash comforter","This set is very cute and will liven up any space with its colorful pattern. However the tag on the comforter says machine washable, but when I took it out of the dryer it was all clumpy. All the stuffing in the corners had clumped together. It also wrinkles easily. So after one washing it looks old and worn, walmart sales better quality comforters. I gave it three stars as it does help a good cause."
3,Entertaining - wish more of Jin Yong's work were available in English,"Outside of China/Taiwan/HK, Jin Yong's work is probably best known as being similar to Ang Lee's 2000 film ""Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon."" Suffice to say, if you liked ""Crouching Tiger,"" you will probably like Jin Yong.Bear in mind, however, that reading Jin Yong without understanding Confucianism, Buddhism or Taoism is like reading C.S. Lewis without understanding Christianity. You may get a good story, but that's all you're getting. Still, it's a good story."
4,Good buy,"For the price ($13), this was a very good buy. As a set w/ bonus, I expected the set (duvet and a sham) + another sham as the bonus. When I received it, there's only 1 sham. Besides that, it has that waffled look, which is cute and the cotton is soft (if you're use to the 1000 thread count, you may not think so though)."
5,Wayne's Best,"I have a personal album collection (vinyl) of about 500. Just for perspective, my favorite band is the Grateful Dead. My dad bought this album in 1974, when I was 12 years old. This is one of my top 20 favorite albums. It is raw, and the band speeds up the tempo during the songs. But it is very melodic; then exhilerating. The louder you play it and the more often you listen to it, the better it gets."
1,Proof that art majors are not engineers,This book is a coffee table book for Disney fans. While the creations are artistic they are not sound by any strech of the imagination. If you are looking for information that you can use look elsewhere. If you are looking for pretty pictures that defy logic and and engineering this is the book for you.
2,WATERED DOWN,"The Secret of the Old Clock marks the debut of Nancy Drew an outgoing vivacious teenage sleuth. She is bold, tenacious anddedicated the righting the wrongs in her world. Alas, this edited version from the original 1930 text is definitely watered down. Our heroine, is not as assertive as she was in the original and her character is flat. The original 1930 version is better written, adds more drama and puts you in the context of the times. It also shows the human side of Nancy that is not captured in the present version.Okay, so this is not the ""real"" Nancy Drew. Should I have my child read it? By all means. Although it lacks the depths of the orignal it is entertaining mystery literature for those under the age of nine. They will love the exploits of Nancy and their imagination will run wild. I do recommend that they read it and if at all possible the original. The contrasts of the two Nancy Drews is a mystery within itself."
4,Nancy Drew is awesome!,It's a really exciting book. I can't wait to get home from school to finish it. I'd like to be like Nancy Drew!
2,Awesome book -- Lousy printing,"Certainly this is Nancy Drew just as great as she ever was. There is absolutely nothing wrong with the Nancy Drew story.The problem is with the way the book was printed. Although it is a hardcover book, the print quality is terrible, it looks at least like there was way too much ink on the printer when it was pressed (although I highly doubt that is how books are printed anymore). For $8 I would have expected much better quality printing and also the paper is very much like that used in really cheap pulp fiction books. I got a paperback at the same time that was $3 cheaper and had awesome print quality and good quality paper. Sad to see Nancy treated so badly!"
3,kindle version is NOT the original text,"If you are seeking the original text, you will have to do your research and buy the hardbacks. All of the Kindle versions - including this one - are the revised twenty chapter, updated texts. While all of the revised texts are lesser stories, the originals usually garner 4-5 stars. I guess I like my Nancy with the moxie she originally had!"
4,The amazing kindness and hospitality of Nancy Drew,"Although it took many, many pages to warm up to Nancy, it finally began to happen. I was at first taken aback by her amazing kindness and hospitality; you do not meet many Nancy Drews in 2010 America and she seemed unrealistic and one-dimensional.After I made comments of this sort on my blog, all the Nancy Drew fans ganged up on me and urged me to reexamine my thoughts about Nancy with gentler, pre-2010 eyes. So I did. Who wants to risk being beaten up by a horde of Nancy Drew aficionados?So I will revise my initial impressions of Nancy as a goody-two-shoes to that of a genuinely nice person who has learned to always be kind and helpful to the young and the poor and the elderly. Such a person could exist. Right?One can only hope."
2,Disappointed in This Book,"This book was sad and depressing! I LOVED the first and second Aunt Dimity books (Aunt Dimity's Death and Aunt Dimity and The Duke) and enjoyed the third book, but I really disliked the tone and topic of this book. Cozy mysteries usually make me feel happy, but this was depressing. I prefer lighter topics that end happily. I wish that I had just skipped this book in the series. Frankly, I haven't read the later books, because this one left me feeling unhappy about the series. However, I do plan to read the later books. I so loved the early books and I'm hoping that this was just an aberration in an otherwise fun and happy series!"
1,Maybe I received a lemon,"Purchased this battery for my camcorder as a backup to the original battery that came with the camera in January, 2006. It is now September, 2006 and The battery will no longer hold the charge. Will try and contact the manufacturer and get a replacement"
3,I got what I paid for...,"I bought this as a second battery for my Canon EOS Rebel, so that I could go longer between charges. I can't argue with the price, but I can argue with the 1500mAh rating printed on the side. In using it for high-speed sports photography, it lasted for almost exactly half as many shots as the original Canon 800mAh battery. It was worth the $13 I paid for it, but still..."
2,False Advertising?,"You have to be a little suspicious about this battery. First, in big letters, the info page says ""5 year warranty"". But then, in the finer print, it turns out it's a one-year warranty.Also, the page describes it as a 1000 ma-H (milliampere-hour) battery, an indication of it's total capacity, hence usable time between recharges. But if you examine the photo of the product closely, the packaging says it's NOT 1000 ma-H, but 800 ma-H. And in smaller type on the description, it also says 800 ma-H.Is this Amazon's mistake, or is the company trying to put one (or two) over on us?"
3,Very effective filter,"This filter kept my oscar tank crystal clear, and smelling less fishy. I would not reccomend it if you have a tank in your bedroom and you are a light sleeper, because it kept me up at night when everything else was quiet."
2,C'mon guys!,"The label and the artists are capable of soooo much more. See OM lounge vol 3, for example. Starting to pump 'em out without regard for quality. SLOW DOWN and take care."
4,Very nice form factor. Works in barebones fashion on Mac OS X,"Very lightweight. Perfect for travelling with. Nice color, greyscale and BW scans. Did not give it 5 stars because the software on Mac OS X is skimpy although the enclosed TWAIN driver does make it compliant with most Mac OS X scanning software. Also very wide and thick glossy sheets can slip in the scanner. Nonetheless, for 3-4 page at a time scans, this fits the bill nicely."
5,Very Very Cool!!!,"Buddy Miller again!! Thank the heavens for some real talent these days. Some of the best music that you'll most likely never hear on any radio. Excellent!""My Love Will follow You"" is worth the price alone."
5,pretty romantic comedy,"Wow is a love that is born at first sight, and of the form that develops it's incredible. While see the film was as if I was living it. Piper Perabo and Lena Heady were excellent and Ol director Parker also. We can't to make another film together and that is a little but strong the plot (love in all the sense). So if you have not seen it then ahead.From Puerto Rico greetings to all"
4,Would have like'd to seen more...,"I thought the film was great, though the relationship between the two women should have been more elaborated. You could have develodped it on a deeper level. I would like to see a follow-up! All in alla a good film, but I have to say that my exspectations were higher!"
5,Happy together,"""Imagine me and you, I doI think about you day and night, it's only rightTo think about the girl you love and hold her tightSo happy together""(The Turtles)Short Attention Span Summary (SASS):1. Boy marries girl2. Girl sees girl across the crowded room3. Girl finds reasons to keep seeing girl4. Delightful romantic comedy follows with great music and energetic dance sequence via Dance Dance Revolution5. ... and everyone lives happily, even though not necessarily togetherPiper Perabo and Lena Headey are the shining stars of this British romantic comedy, which leaves you with both a good feeling and a catchy song which you won't be able to stop singing for weeks after seeing the movie.Recommended for anyone who believes in love at first sight, and those who take a little longer.Amanda Richards, June 27, 2009"
3,Will probably arrive damaged...,"Now, maybe it was poor judgement on my behalf to buy bulk potato chips online, but I like Pringles. These arrived, and I noticed, by ear, some damage, but I didn't think it would be that great, so I opened it up anyway.The first can had minimal breakage, and I thought, alright, this is fine. I just oepened can number two now though, and I see shards of Pringles up to about the halfway point of the can.So yes, lots of these chips were cracked beyond recognition during shipping, which isn't the best way to enjoy a Pringle. Amazon definitely needs to package this item better."
1,Bionaire BAP3175 Total Dud!!,"Do not buy this product! We purchased this same item and it worked for about a month. There is no support from the company and I have found multiple accounts online of similiar performance. Actually the accounts of working for about a month are across the Bionaire product line, so they obviously have systemic quality problems...Don't waste your money or your time on this product line."
4,Works great for me,"When I go camping I pull two trailers with my pick-up, which are the pop-up camper and dual jet ski trailer. When I tried this set-up without the anti-sway bar the jet ski trailer was extremely prone to sway at any speed over 40 mph. After I purchased the anti-sway bar, I can travel 50+ before I have to worry much about sway.It is somewhat a pain to have the extra ball welded to your hitch, but it is a necessary pain. Once it is installed it does a good job in reducing trailer sway. It seems to be a great product at a very reasonable cost."
1,Dead in 3 months,"I bought a Akai LCD TV 3 months ago. It is dead now. No sound and no picture. Their customer service was terrible, also. I will not ever buy this brand any more."
5,Beautiful and Epic,A love story everyone can only dream about. I read this in high school and its still my favorite love story 12 years later. I am so glad its available on kindle now even though I own 3 copies in hardback.
3,Good book but not very deep,This is a good book but quite basic. Most of the advices are just common sense. If you have basic knowledge in psychology this book won't teach you anything new.
3,Bigger than size chart,"I went exactly by the size chart and they are too big. I was hoping they would shrink (for once), but no luck. I may order them again, because they are nice jeans, but will order a size smaller. (I know, I should have returned them, but needed the jeans and didn't want the hassle.)"
3,Poor materials?,I like these jeans and have ordered at least 8 pairs. Mostly because they fit and are comfortable. The reason I've had to order so many pairs is that they rip at the corner of the back pocket and at the seam to the left of the zipper. It seems like they should last MUCH longer before getting holes or ripping but I continue to buy because they are comfortable.
2,"aye, it's too bad.","Rory Gallagher is a great, under-recognized talent that deserves state of the art recordings, but instead what we have here is a lousy, third-rate recording of some his finest pieces. There is really little else to say, other than that this is quite a disappointing recording indeed. Listeners and fans should seek out his studio recordings instead, or perhaps his live BBC CD."
5,Russian Revolution,"This DVD is sooo cool. These girls have it all -- talent, looks and a fighting spirit. Oh yeah, and a WHOLE LOT of attitude. Girls Rule!! The interviews and film of Anna and Maria are amazing. The part I didn't expect, though, is all the new ones. Everyone knows Kournikova and Sharapova. They were first and made women's tennis popular. But after seeing this film I don't think they will be considered the best or even the most beautiful. This film rocks."
3,Strange behaviours...,Great surprise. Funny. Not even about lesbianism. More so about a 20 something neurotic.
4,You People Are Stupid.,"You idiots giving the 1 star reviews are stupid. This title never offered new music, its just a dvd of a single video with a 'remix'. Why complain about this saying that its short or whatever, its 6.99! wtf do you expect. I own salival and the parabol dvd, and am ordering this schism dvd. No, i'm not one of those guys who dress in all black, I just recongnize incredibly good music. The reason I give the review 4 stars is because they should've just put both videos on one disc and the commentary really doesn't describe the video at all."
2,if you're a lustmord fan...,"I'd get these ""new"" dvds if you've never seen the videos,are a diehard lustmord fan(I like the guy's dark ambient stuff personally),diehard jello biafra fan,or are a tool completist but for me these aren't quite a must-have.when salival came out and cost around $25 I thought there would be more to it ala the pantera vids which were each around 2 hours long,not that I would wanna see tool partying down like that but some live footage to go with the vids woulda been nice.on the bright side at least they're not selling the things for ten bucks or more like so many rap artists have done.If I were you I'd search for a decently priced used copy of salival(which is now out of print I believe)which has more to offer."
4,"Great Material, Probably worth the money","Hey Jake Cambell, I am a college educated, staunch republican, and I my favorite band of all time is Tool. (Maybe AIC..) Some people follow Maynard like he is god, some think Tool opens up new worlds, or some just love the music because we appreciate good music...like me. Anyways...I think this dvd is worth it, but you won't be any less of a Tool fan if you don't buy it."
2,Bleh...,"The title of the DVD should have been ""We released all our videos one by one so Maynard can put bigger hubcaps on his SUV""I can see him now. Hip deep in trashy underage girls, drinking champane, and shining his fronts with his index finger using the reflection from one of his platinum records. Its nice to know that in an age where most new cds come with DVDs that have TWICE the content of these two singles, TOOL finds it appropriate to charge top dollar for their wares. If only they still had the quality to back it up."
2,BP 880CL Replacement Battery,"Nice enough battery, but short lived. I picked one of these up about 5 years ago as a second battery for my Minolta A-200. It won't hold much of a charge any longer, yet the OEM battery is still going strong. So for five years (it actually was dying about a year & a half ago), that's not bad, but considering I have other rechargeable batteries that are much older (and the OEM's long life), it's not that great. But still a good battery.I would buy another one, if I can't find the OEM battery, if only because I can't find the OEM battery. Just thought I'd add my long term use of this battery to those who would be interested. I don't use my camera any more or less than anyone else, let it get to nearly empty before recharging it & the like. Take it on vacations, trips & the like, leave it alone most of the winter, the normal stuff."
2,Expectation vs product,"The book is more of a catalogue than an architectural publication. It certainly contains lots of contemporary details, but these are often displayed lacking context. I believe this book was published to help architects in their everyday practice, but don't we have enough commercial material these days?What I was looking for was an album showing contemporary interior design case studies, focusing on details. What I found was another market offer, except published in a hardcover. However, there are some interesting photos in a book, and if you are looking for a tool that could improve communication between designers and their customers it is worth the money."
4,SISTER REALLY HAD GAME,"THIS WAS A FUN READ. THE CHARACTER DARIAN TRULY HAD GAME AND USED IT! I JUST DON'T GET THE WHOLE CRYING DURING SEX THING!? SORRY BUT I DON'T REALLY CARE FOR THE FACT THAT THE CHARACTER HAD SEX SO QUICKLY AND WITH A MAN THAT SHE HAD JUST MET. I KNOW THAT THIS IS JUST A BOOK BUT I'M SURE THAT THERE ARE SOME YOUNG ADULTS READING THIS WHO MAY GET THE WRONG IMPRESSION FROM THIS. I'VE READ SEVERAL OF LESLIE ESDAILE'S BOOKS AND IN ALL OF THE ONES THAT I HAVE READ SHE HAS HAD HER FEMALE CHARACTERS ""GET BUSY"" AFTER A WEEK OF MEETING THE MALE. I KNOW THAT ""S**T HAPPENS"" BUT NOT IN EVERY BOOK. SORRY I'M JUST TOO ""OLD FASHIONED"""
5,Fantastic!,"I was so pleasantly surprised by this book that I had to write my first-ever review on Amazon (although I consult the reviews all the time). This book had characters that jumped off the page, and the author's style of writing is so down-to-earth that I felt like I could hang out with Darien, Arnetta and the whole Ferguson clan. This book gave me the ""warm & fuzzies"" and I actually read it a second time because I didn't want the story to end. Great job and I can't wait to pick up other titles by this author!"
1,Purchase,This was the worst ring ever...I wore it about 12 hours and it turned my finger green!! What a complete waste of money.....DO NOT PURCHASE THIS ITEM!
4,Great 50's style rockabilly!,"This brought back memories of listening to country music of 50's and 60's. Not the smooth, pop candy country music of the 90's. Give me twang anyday!"
3,A Disappointed Fullmetal Fan,"I only just got this game yesterday, and I don't really think it was worth it. This game has non-stop fighting, and no time to relax, and look at your surroundings. Most spots are blocked off, only giving you one path to follow. There's no other way to beat the game. And it's a long way between save points, so you have to play the game for a long time in order to go to where you can save the game.But otherwise, it was an ok game. I have to say that, being the Fullmetal Alchemist fan that I am. The cut-scenes were interesting, they were from episodes I didn't see. The first one is from a different version of ""To Challenge the Sun"", and the Chimera just sucked. The fight scene of it was pretty lame, but then, I'm not rating that one episode.I'd reccomend this game to people who like Anime, and who like fighting games."
2,Pretty lame actually,"Full Metal Alchemist was an awesome anime... so I guess I was expecting an awesome game... this is just a bunch of cut screens, talking and storyline... oh well."
1,light is shocking....no really shocking,I would not ever use another one of these lights. We have several at work. Tonight one of the bulbs went out and when I reached under it to turn the light to see what type of bulb it took I got 110 volts to the hand. There is a small metal wire that helps keep the elec plug in the bulb. It can move and get in the wires lighting more than the bulb. Very unsafe.... if you have one watch out. We are in the process now of removing all of them and cutting the plugs off.
2,"great material, but poor presentation","this book has excellent material in linear algebra, unfortunately the presentation leaves a lot to be desired. if you like ""classical old textbook-style presentation"", then this is the book for you, otherwise, you should invest in Horn/Johnson or Kreyszig. note that the treatment of this book is deeper than the treatment in the popular Strang, albeit in a much less-accessible packaging."
3,Elizabeth Taylor at the height of her beauty compensates for a tired plot,"Charles Vidor (GILDA) directs this glossy MGM Technicolor romancer which is set in the world of classical music with large doses of Tchaikovsky, Rachmaninoff and Beethoven concerts stopping the movie cold. A neurotic, spoiled rich girl (Elizabeth Taylor) must play second fiddle to an emerging violinist (Vittorio Gassman) whose first love is music. Meanwhile, a pianist (John Ericson) pines over Liz. Someone's bound to get hurt big time. Taylor is at the height of her beauty and looks terrific in her Helen Rose frocks and gowns and the glam factor is enough to hold one's interest until it gets all sappy and sentimental during the film's final 20 minutes. With Louis Calhern, Michael Chekhov, Barbara Bates and Stuart Whitman.The Warners Archives MOD DVD is a vivid transfer."
2,Eats Filters and hard to carry with type of handle,"I've had many Holmes humidifiers. I only had mine since Dec 14 and need a filter already. I have soften water and STILL use additives to the water every night. After doing my research about filters, I'll never buy Holmes brand again! Honeywell has a filter that is far better quality. Thank for placing your input her it really helps. Ho! Yes it does sound like my cat is sick when it drops more water!!!!"
1,video,"I really should have returned this video, but i jsut didn't get around to it. It was listed in good condition, but we could barely hear the conversation because of background distortion. We watched it once and i was sad as i had hoped to be able to watch it over and over. I remember enjoying this story so much as a kid and wanted my kids to enjoy it too."
5,realistic movie about not just parenthood but human being at dif. stages of arguments,"if you are in the stage of argument, you just have to see this movie. it would somehow answer why people (man vs female or m vs m or f vs f) fight and argue all the time! it is a unique piece of art!"
1,"So bland, I couldn't make it through the movie.","4 people, arguing over their petty children's scuffle. It lacked depth. I couldn't make it past the moment where they came back inside, to have scotch."
1,Garbage,"I really could'nt believe how bad this movie was. I expected so much more with such a stellar cast but alas NO, it was a tough 75 minutes.Then again i thought Tower Heist was unfunny too."
1,Boring,"This is one of the most boring movies I have watched in awhile, I could not watch it all the way through, my wife watched most of it and also thought it was not worth the $.99 or the time."
1,"Now this is bad ""really Bad""","Wife kept falling asleep and I lasted less than forty minutes. This ia a play period. Nothing but people arguing non stop. Kept waiting for something to happen, nothing. Shut it off and here I am writing about a waste of time."
3,Not that amazing but pretty good overall,"Only two things bothered me a bit: this has been overhyped with all sorts of adjectives that do not really apply; and sometimes Foster is overdoing things a bit, surprisingly.The rest of the time she is great, as are her fellow actors, with an entertaining script concerning two sets of rather awful parents and an altercation between their sons. No heartbreak but a lot of humor; many revelatory moments regarding the parenting and the marriages too."
2,Mine broke after 18 months,"The laptop is sleek, sexy, and is ergonomic enough, but apparently, there is a reliability issue. Mine stopped booting up after 18 months of normal use. I don't leave it running hot, I use that Targus cooling pad with a USB-powered fan.It was definitely not an LCD issue. The repair technician recommended that I replace the motherboard and/or CPU, but was unable to fix it otherwise.I found this 66-page thread too late... but it's enough to keep me away from purchasing another Vaio to replace this broken one:http://www.hardwareanalysis.com/content/topic/5449/?o=0"
5,Great view of the grapes,"Successor to Robinson's large-format ""Vines, Grapes and Wines,"" this delightful little book sorts out the world of wine not geographically, as encyclopedias usually do, but on the basis of grapes. Chock full of information about grapes from the commonplace (Chardonnay) to the bizarre (Refosco dal Peduncolo Rosso), this pocket-size book is a must for the wine-trivia lover or the serious wine fancier"
3,Poor quality DVD,"The movie we enjoyed. However, the DVD seemed like it was a bootlegged copy. Early in the movie it was poor quailty with dark shadows and poor contrast. Towards mid to end of the movie it improved with much brighter and more vivid quality. Mid movie it froze. Even after backing it up and trying again it froze in the same spot every time. We had to manually go to the next scene. Good movie, poor quality DVD."
2,very predictable formula plot,"Hmmm, I was hoping for more than this. The announcer was so annoying. My teenagers were not impressed. Maybe for young middle school kids. This one will be on the $5 rack at a discount store near you."
5,Great support of Lacrosse,"My 10-year-old really likes the action of the lacrosse game in the movie, and the teenage interactions/language. I like the way the Indians identified the roots of the game as a game they played to honor their Creator. Winning and losing are secondary. But you play your best. It has a different tone to the game that young kids need at this age so they don't become little machines driven to always win but a person with a heart who plays with heart -- win or lose. Great movie for teens."
5,Good movie,My Son plays Lacrosse. He really liked the movie. He has shared it with 5 team mates who all liked it. Good movie.
4,Was Fun.,This movie was fun to watch.Kind of cheesy but I was still entertained by the wonderful story. I recommend this movie.
3,Fun movie,"Big lacrosse fan, so I definitely wanted to see the movie. The acting, script, and plot are a little trite, but still decent. The lacrosse action is well done."
4,Crooked Arrows,"I really enjoyed this movie. There is a powerful lesson in it, so I also recommend it for the younger generation."
2,My Honest Opinion,"I bought the album thinking he went a little more main stream. ""Slow jams"" was getting a lot of play on the radio, but the rest of the album left me saying what happened? The album is good for return Twista fans just not if your liking the one song. I suggest picking up the single."
2,okay.....kinda,"I always wondered what happened to Twista and his Speedknot Mobstaz crew. Twista is probably the fastest rapper in the business and it is definately a breath of fresh air in comparison to the huge number of slow, raspy, mumbling rappers of late. No doubt, the best beats of the album are the two songs produced by Kayne West, ""Slow Jams"" and ""Overnight Celebrity."" The problem with this album, however, is huge inconsistencies with quality beats and extremely cliched songs such as ""Like a 24"" and ""Badonkadonk."" If I hear the line ""I keep my mind on my money, money on my mind"" one more time in a song, I will shoot myself. The equally horrible ""Hope"" has some of the corniest and predictable lyrics I've ever heard (even with the great Cee-Lo on the track) and seems like a poor attempt to get even more radio play (on par with less corny, but still lousy 'Where's the Love' by BEP)!"
4,Most of you are wrong about this album,"OK first off The Game ""B"" you gave this album a bad rating because of some stupid reasons...u sound to me like u liked the commerical aspect of this album compared to twista's real talent. I mean come on you rated each song and gave Badunkadunk a higher rating that One Last Time. You should go and buy some Nelly Cds because you will probably like those alot more. And speaking of Nelly...Twista shouldn't slow down like you said, that's his trademark just like Nelly's Band-aid on his face. Really this album may not be the greatest thing ever but there are some tight tracks on here like Kill Us All, One Last Time, and really that's about it. So if you want to bump to 2 tracks do it...otherwise u'll just be listening to the commercial tracks of this album."
3,Tight... but gets old quick,"After listening to thiz album up and down dont get me wrong.. the cd tight... but... its like after you heard what he had to say and realize what exactly he be saying (some of the stuff is repetitive) then u be like dang I dont wanna hear this any more... the tight tracks:Pimp On (his verse Only), Overnight Celebrity, Kill Us all, Higher, and Still Feels Good is the cd's high points. You cant hear him in Snoopin' WEll at all, Like a 24 has a good chorus... but the rest of that mess is wack as ever... Slow Jams is better on Kanye's Cd as this one is stripped down considerably. Anyways In my opinion this cd is tight, but its no Adrenaline Rush... that is still currently his tightest cd."
4,Krazy,"This album is absolutely nuts!! Twista, Kanye, Jazze Pha, and Toxic went truly Kamikaze with this ablum. Although I only gave it 4 stars, I'm gonna buy another one."
4,YOU KNOW WHAT TIME IT IS!,"I only have one thing to say: ""ROC-A-FELLA YA'LL"". Enough said. I definitly recommend this album. It's the best hip-hop CD out and will be for the next month or so."
4,Twista Delivers!!,"Twista definitely delivers with this new album. Probably the most underrated MC comes through with his new highly anticipated album. Nobody can possibly hate on the hype flows that he kicks in this almbum. This album has everything, songs that can rocked at a club along with serious songs with a message. There are a couple songs that are questionable but overall this album is worth the money. Twista needs to get more respect in the industry and this album should most definately give him the respect he deserves. If your even considering buying this album or don't know much about Twista go out and buy it now. If you're even a fan of hip-hop you should buy this album because you won't be disappointed."
3,L.R. 1st and 2nd tv seasons.,"For a nice section of radio shows from this series go too the following ""SPERDVAC.con"" or connect me at Radioholmes.aol, have over four-hundred of them direct from discs.The first eighteen TV programs are network versions and the others are the syndicated versions. The network have titles.The three episodes from the 1966 CBS cartoons are NOT on the bonus disc. They use the same opening from one of the programs for all of the episodes. They think they can trademark the opening music on this. You can't tradmark the ""William Tell Overture"", it was composed in 1829. It was a good try but they could have done better. The prints could have been clean-up. This was done with ""The James Bond"" films."
5,Good price on an OEM item,Purchased this for a 2002 Cadillac Escalade. No issues after the first 3000 miles. It is an OEM piece that gave my mechanic no problems to install. It was priced right through Amazon and saved me a trip to the auto parts store.
5,I love this book!,"Goswami merges science and spirituality like no other. You don't need to possess a scientific mind to follow most of his argument. The universe is indeed self-aware and Goswami proves that fact, merging east and west in way that makes perfect sense."
2,"Great concept, poorly written book.","The Holographic UniverseIf you're interested in new universal models based on quantum theories, I'd really recommend just picking up Michael Talbot's ""The Holographic Universe."" He essentially says the same thing, but his English is much easier to digest, and he manages to make quantum function seem as fascinating as it should to the layman, whereas Goswami tends to describe the same experiments in utterly boring, repetitive detail."
2,MONISTIC Idealism? Hello!,"The problem I find with Goswami is his choice of terms, particularly ""monistic idealism."" According to my education, ""monistic"" means you believe in one kind of substance, namely matter or soul substance. If Goswami admits the reality of matter, as he does in the first chapter and even implies in the subtitle of the book, then how can he call himself a ""MONISTIC idealist?"" The term denotes that he must believe that mind or ""consciousness"" is all that exists, but he hangs himself by allowing the reality of matter. So, he's really a DUALIST after all.Don't waste your time on this book. For a better example of pure idealistic monism, check out George Berkeley (you can find him in a book titled _The Empiricists_), or go back to the Hindu and other Indian sages upon whom Goswami draws."
2,"Hard to watch, slow and weird",Just what I would expect from Flaming Lips but a big disappointment.sad too because the doc. Fearless Freaks is great.
4,Sleeve works well overall,Sleeve gives good protection from being dropped and protects from the weather. Also keeps it still when I have it in the car. Only drawbacks are that the protective screen is not connected to sleeve and can let water in and that holes were not put on the top of the sleeve for the headphone jack and lock button.
2,very few crafts to make,"This book has nice pictures, which might inspire you with some new ideas for arranging your Christmas items, or give you some ideas for things to purchase. But the majority of objects shown are uncredited, so you might have difficulty with even that. There are only a handful of actual projects to make, and these are certainly not the most attractive objects pictured. Not worth buying, in my opinion."
3,Some ideas,"I was anticipating this book to be full of vintage Xmas like the title says but instead most of the items are new! Except for the final chapter by Debbie Dusenberry and her store Curious Sofa. This was a chapter worth buying the book for. Great photography, ideas and display from her. She should have had more chapters or maybe a book of her own."
2,Vintage Christmas Crafts,"I was hoping to find some new Christmas crafts to use for decorating this year. I was a bit dissapointed to see that most of the crafts were ones that I've already seen in some older books. I was hoping to get some new ideas. The way the decorations were set up in the book inspired me, though. The rooms looked like an old-fashioned Christmas from my childhood."
3,"Easy to fit, but not great vision","Primary reason I bought these lenses was due to major fogging issues. I play in Thailand where we have high humidity and it's hot night or day. I was expecting these lenses to give me at least some improved level of for resistance but they were a bit of let down on that front. On top of which the ""clear"" lense was not very ""clear"". Seems to have a grey tint though I am reasonable sure I was sent the right version of the lense. So while they were easy to fit, I find I have returned to the original lense and washing up liquid as the better option. Again I will add I am in a very high humidity location so this most likely is a key factor in why the anti fog has not performed as expected."
5,The best film ever!!!,"If you liked the old Zorro films then you will LOVE this one, there are loads of fight scenes, tons of comedy and a reasonable amount of naked women."
5,Good old fashioned excitment and romance!,"The Mask of Zorro combines good old-fashioned adventure with some romance, comedy and style. Banderas was great and Anthony Hopkins always delivers an exceptional performance (with the exception that he is the oldest Zorro I've ever seen). The heroine of the movie is drop-dead gorgeous and she can use a sword as well. This is fun for anyone. Go get it today!"
4,Mask of Zorro,I can't believe how quickly I received by product. Excellent. Would definately purchase from this seller again.
4,Beautiful Digital Picture and Sound.,"Crystal clear digital picture no visible artificats. The 5.1 sound track is simply one of the best I have heard. The story is also very entertaining and somewhat original. How often do we get to see someone train their own successor. I fully enjoyed this movie. Anthony Hopkins once again shows why he is one of the industries best actors. A little more creativity in the story line and I would have given this five stars. Still, I highly recommend the big Z."
4,Quatre Etoiles,This movie has good action scenes. The plot is dumb. Catherine Zeta-Jones is so hot. I became a fan of hers after this movie.
5,Great movie,"Always been a fan of this movie!! Plenty of action, romance, and just overall a fantastic movie. Highly recommend this movie!!"
5,Blazing Action,"I have never been one to watch a Zorro film, but after watching ""The Mask of Zorro"", I think I could become an instant fan. This movie blends everything so well that you almost think your battling right beside Antonio Banderas. ""The Mask of Zorro"" is one movie worth your time and money."
1,Am I the only one who hated it???,"I'm surprised Anthony Hopkins decided to do this movie. The choice of Antonio Banderas (rightfully dubbed ""flavor of the month"" by Siskel & Ebert), however, is perfect. A cliche-ridden replica of most ""action adventures,"" this is a fast paced film with a few laughs and thrills that adds NOTHING new to the genre. Perfect if you like mindless action entertainment - a la Desperado. If you like movies that make you think (at least a little bit), avoid this one like the plague (appropriate to end my review with a cliche)."
3,Character Development would have elevated this film,"Fun, swashbucker in the Errol Flynn style. However, development of the relationship between Hopkins and Banderas and a little less 'filler' would have meant all the difference. The dance sequence between Banderal and Zeta ??what's her name? indicated to me that the talent was certainly there, someone was unwilling to reach the larger audience. I would have liked--more."
2,dissapointed,When I heard about this movie I was excited because I loved Zorro. But when I saw this I thought what the hell were they thinking. Zorro needs a smile of that of a fox. very misleading. The basis of the movie wasn't even good. You need something where you can really think is he really zorro or does he have a twin. I didn't get that from this. I never thought I would not like a zorro movie but when I saw this I hated it right from the start. The only other movie I hated of a zorro type was the gay blade I mean that was the stupidest movie..So my final word on this movie is that I hated it and I don't reccomend it!
3,Classic... BUT.... Something's missing....,"Honeymoon is the first episode, where they ""must somehow form a family"" -- Mike and ... get married.A Camping We Will Go is a classic from early in the series where they are still trying to form a family.HOWEVER, having watched these episodes when they first ran, this video seems to have trimmed scenes out of both episodes! Especially in the camping video, there seems to be NO support for the girls projecting the bear onto the boys tent. In the original I saw, the boys did something to provoke it. NOT IN THIS VIDEO. So dissapointed. I've noticed the same thing (cut scenes) in the Gilligan's Island videos from AOL/TimeWarner.Anyone else notice this? Am I dreaming?"
1,"Broken game , dont waste your money","Not much to say, its broken , apparently there is a point you cant get past because of a glitch , don't buy it if you do you will be banging your head later"
5,A nice Faux-Sheepskin Pad,"Our dogs love this pad, it fits well in the kennels and the corner ""cuts"" help keep it in place. We have washed it once and it came out just like new. I would recommend it to pet owners who kennel their animals overnight or for parts of the day. They just sleep better on these type of pads!"
2,Not what I expected,"Susan Werner's voice is strong and that is what carries this CD. Unfortunately I don't believe it is enough to make this a favorite in my collection.She was definitely born too late if this is the music she continues with...even this boomer can't relate!I am looking for more Great Out There, Like Bonsai and Old Mistake tunes - songs with emotion and meaning.This CD lacked that kick for me.B"
5,great review book,Excellent study guide. All topics covered thoroughly. The only downfall is that pre-calculus and above is not covered.
5,Superpatriotism and the link to Military Incompetence,"Dr. Parenti's book is truly magnificent. He argues, essentially, that Americans have been brainwashed into thinking that our country is all-powerful and all-good. Thoughtful citizens, like Dr. Parenti, know otherwise. He links American nationalism to militarism, and how this linkage discourages Americans from criticizing the military, especially since the ""victory"" we supposedly won in Desert Storm. This book is essential and necessary to any American who wants to see past the propaganda they are exposed to on a daily basis. If you like this book, you might also want to read Professor Roger Thompson's bookLessons Not Learned: The U.S. Navy's Status Quo Culture, which Dr. Parenti has endorsed, and argues that it is indeed patriotic to criticize the American military, especially when it is proven to be incompetent. I highly recommend this book!"
4,Makes you think about patriotism,Parenti's book really makes you think about patriotism. Is it blind or not. A good look at the country and poses some interesting questions.
3,Different view.,It used words I don't think many would use today but that was then. Tilted somewhat to the white men but also tells there misdeeds. I think it maybe a little closer look at that time period than most are. It was written earlier enough to you would think anyway he had a clearer look at the events. Over all I enjoyed the book. But it does ramble some.
5,Protec CONTOURED TENOR TROMBONE PRO PAC,"My daughter said this was the bag she wanted, so it was the bag she got. She knew what she was talking about. The bag is well made and protects her trombone. It is much lighter than the big boxy original case that came with the trombone."
4,Good time had by all....,"I got this helmet along with the Deluxe Child Darth Vader Costume for my 4yr old as part of his Halloween ensemble. It was a huge hit. While trick or treating, people were stopping him on the street to take his picture! The helmet will also fit adults (we've all played with it). The phrases and the breathing are good but the actual voice changer is pretty lame (the voice changer in the Optimus Prime helmet is MUCH better) but overall, it's a great toy and my son loves it and it MADE his costume."
4,Pretty Good,"I think the Darth Vader Voice changer is Pretty Good. It could have some work on the Voice changing part. I own it and think its cool lookin and the sounds and lines from the movie are good its just that you need to work at your voice to get the good sound. i think you should get it if you luv darth vader. well...ummm you know what i mean.Your star wars expert,Jacob"
2,Voice Changer? No.,"Length:: 2:43 MinsThis is not a voice changer, this is something that kind of adds on to your voice, droning in the background.I put it on, and of course, like all the ""1""s said, the head peace busted right off (that's what I get for being born with a big head) --- but it's not as bad as they say, you can put it back on if you know how to work it right...But lets get real, this thing does not make you sound like Darth unless you have your ear right up to the little speaker that will sit on your chest.It's really kind of weird that they put the speaker at the base of the control panel... if you were really short, and the person wearing it were really tall, maybe then it would make sense...Anyway, long story short, but the TRANSFORMERS voice changing helmet... the Darth Vader one is kind of lame."
3,Darth Vader Voice Changer for fun not educational,It's OK if you want to dress up as Darth Vader for Halloween and/or pretend play. The voice changer is mediocre at best.
2,This is a load of crap!,"The education value is that it hurts! *wah!* You dont sound like vader, but it is funny to hear if you have a high pitch voice!"
3,poopoo in the paynts paynts poopoo in the paynts,Its cool but its big hard 2 saber duel in and the voice changer barely works.unless ur over 5'10 and have a low voice and love star wars dont buy it.The other features are good.and its fun 2 pretend 2 be darth vadar and it the middle of the night @ a sleep over use it when ur friends asleep and the'll poop in their pynts.Its good 4 that.its ur choice.i say no but w/e.
4,Darth Vadar Voice Changer Helmet,"Nice little toy for the price, fits kids through adult because of the adjustable strap. pretty much looks like your darth vader, at least from the shoulders up.The voice changer mode is a tad bit overrated, and the volume not nearly loud enough. Still the mask qualities are all by themselves great for the price."
5,great,"i think it is really cool to be able to talk like darthvator,i've been waiting for something like that.i think it is asome."
4,Perfect gift for 9 year-old boys,All of my son's friends think this is a really cool toy. My son puts it on almost daily and walks around the house in the Darth Vadar breathing mode.
4,Great if you like Star Wars,"The Darth Vader Voice Changer Helmet is terrific and one of the best voice changer helmets on the market. It will easily replace my Peter Brady Voice Changer Helmet this summer as the only voice changer helmet I wear to the beach, to concerts, or just out on the town."
2,Not effective at all.,"I have this filter along with a Fluval 205 on a 55 gallon goldfish tank. The little Fluval is doing all the work. This canister filter is only equiped for mechanical and chemical filtration when, as we all know biological is by far the most important. There is no room for bio filter media. There is a seperate bio-wheel attatchment for bio filtration. I do not use carbon and so filled the carbon chamber with ceramic rings for bio media. There is VERY little room to add the media of your choice. This filter does a good job at mechanical filtration and my water is generally clear. For only a bit more money you can get an AquaTop or Fluval- both much better in my opinion with a lot of room for media. On the upside the customer service is great- I've called multiple times because of problems and they always help. The filter is simple to assemble and maintain."
5,Great,"Read the instructions, take your time but it works great I do love it, And make sure you test everything out so you have no leaks but it works perfectly"
3,barely waking up,I purchased this as a first alarm clock for my 5 year old. The alarm is not loud enough to wake him up and it has an on/off switch to turn it off that is not in a conveinent place. For the money and a kid that loves Sponge Bob it is not bad (I wanted him to be able to tell time and not rely on a digital clock)but if you are looking for a bedroom alarm clock keep looking.
1,Dead after 2 months limited use!,Havn't used it for anything but smoothies about once a week. Something my $19.95 blender did fairly well for at least 6 months. Thought I would move up to something better. This wasn't it! Service centers are a couple hours away. No more Oster for me!
1,Avoid blender at all costs,"I have had the displeasure of having two of these blenders in my possession. The first one was used no more than 10 times when it decided it wouldn't turn on any more. That blender was only about 6 months old and Target allowed me to exchange the defective one for a new one. The replacement is about a year old and also has been used no more than 10 times. The last 2 or 3 times the blender worked there was a strong electrical burning smell, which I thought was the ""newness"" of the blender showing. Obviously it was in it's death throes because these blenders are good for single digit uses. The replacement blender has failed in the same way as the first by refusing to turn on. When it works, it works fine. Just know that when you buy this blender it is a disposable item. You will pay approximately $10 per blend and then it will die when you've covered your purchase price. I will never buy another Oster product again."
3,Humor in socio-political contrasts.,"The ""American"" subtitles (necessary due to the thickness of the various working-class U.K. accents) provide a very interesting view into this culture; although the plot is a tad thin, the film stands on its own through sheer hilarity of British labor-class machinations.I hope the DVD version comes out soon."
3,Offers an example,"This recording of one woman's vocal opening in the King's Chamber in Egypt, including overtone singing, group toning, and bells is a very simple,clear example of using the voice as a tool for personal development."
4,"Great toothbrush, replacement heads are expensive","I love this toothbrush. It is small, holds a charge for a long time and cleans your teeth and gums effectively. I don't like the fact that they charge you an arm and a leg for head replacements. This is the classic razor/razorblade product approach."
2,Disappointed,"Actually, great brushing action. Very pleased with that.But product life is horrible. Spent over $130.00 and the on-off switch died in less than one year. Just plain bad quality."
4,Sonicare toothbrush,"We had the 5500 series then it died. So now we bought the 7300 series and my husband told me he liked it better then the 5500 series. The 7300 has the feature of the quad interval timer, which is very helpful. We like that it beeps when you need to brush to another area of your mouthIt is so much easier brushing your teeth with Sonicare then with a regular manual toothbrush, we will never go back to manual brush."
3,Not as good as Oral-B Sonic Complete and more expensive.,"This brush cleans very well! You will see and feel a big difference once using an electric toothbrush.My problem with this toothbrush is that the brush connects to the handle by screwing the brush onto the handle. Water seeps into the hollow compartment and is very hard to clean. I would recommend the Oral-B Sonic complete toothbrush which cleans as well as Sonicare, has a better brush (larger, smother), is easier to clean, and is less expensive."
2,Buy the FlexCare,"Do yourself a favor and buy the Sonicare Flex Care. The newer Flex Care models are an upgrade without the screw-on design flaw of this Sonicare model. This model has a hideous design where the saliva and other brushing liquids seep down into the inner mechanisms of the hand piece and pool up in a really disgusting way and requires you to take it apart and clean off inner crevices made up of metal and plastic parts. The new design eliminates all that slew of slime. This brushing action is fantastic, just like the new one, but this design stinks...literally."
2,wearing out,"We have owned 3 Sonicare toothbrushes; each one wears out after about 15 months of use. What happens is the timer or the on / off switch seems to go bad. The effect is the unit shuts off after about 30 seconds of use; holding down the on / off switch buys another 10 seconds or so; then 5 seconds; then nothing.For a product as expensive as this, stay away unless replacing it every 15 months is within your plan as it does do a good job cleaning your teeth."
3,Generates a huge magnetic field,"I love the toothbrush, although it does have a strong buzzing vibration to it.One day I was measuring electro-magnetic fields using the ""Extech 480823"" meter, which I bought from Amazon. I was surprised that the Sonicare Elite's reading was OFF THE CHART, producing over 200 milligauss. I have no idea if this is dangerous, but it's more than 10x stronger than a hair dryer -- and it's right next to your head.I would like to know if the Braun Oral B is similar. Can anyone take a measurement? Our battery powered $5 electric toothbrush produced no significant fields."
3,I don't know what all the fuss is about.,I found the book a little boring and hard to believe. Nothing struck me as especially original or interesting about the characters or the plot. If you read a lot of thrillers you will encounter better plotting and more lively protagonists in many other books
3,A Good Idea Becomes a Vanishing Act,"While the idea of a female non-detective protagonist is a neat twist in the genre, this female has a personality which is neither attractive nor repelling. She is a zero. It is hard to identify with her. She is humorless. Her next door neighbor is totally implausible once he decides to join the chase. The plot was destroyed by the characters. I was hoping Jane Whitefield would get whacked and save me some pain."
5,A Stunner,Don't start this book if you need to do anything else. It grabs you by the throat in the opening scene and never lets go for a minute.There are page turners and then there's the Jane Whitefield books. I read this book in one (long) day and fell madly in love with Jane. I read the next three in less than a week. I can't believe I never heard of Thomas Perry before. I'm truly looking forward to the rest of his books.
3,Is every Indian a wilderness expert?,"This novel features Jane Whitfield, a Seneca from upper New York sho helps fugitives disappear. She is picky about those she helps and she has quite a few resources at her disposal, including incredible outdoor survival skills and a network of associates to help cover her tracks and provide new identities (Isn't it interesting that EVERY Indian character in this type of book is an expert outdoorsman? Just once, I'd like to see an Indian with all of the outdoor skills of Woody Allen!)I almost stopped reading this book about 60 pages in - but it got better. There's a pretty good plot twist that pulls its final grade up to '3 stars'."
3,"we all love hunter s thompson, but","this book isn't a ""fear and loathing in las vegas"" if thats what your hoping forafter reading fear and loathing in las vegas (one of my top 10 books of all time) i started buying up all the hunter s thompson books i could find, wanting more of the same.well, apparently other than fear and loathing in las vegas THE CURSE OF LONO is the only other book that kind of gives that style of writinggeneration of swine and many of his other books are just politics, politics, politicsjust know his style of writing is very different than what you were expecting so check up on the book and see if its the style you were looking for"
4,Sums up the 80's,"Dr. Thompson has done it again. He has taken the 80's decade and showed us what it really was. From Reagan being elected, to the Iran-Contra hearings, no stone is left unturned. Dr. Thompson's social commentaries continue to show the reader the truth instead of what other ""mainstream"" commentators would."
4,"Nice design, but zipper a little hard for my 3 year-old to manage",Size is just right. My child loves the cover design. The zipper is a little hard for my child to manage.
2,Rockafeller Skank by Fatboy Slim,"We really bought this to hear Rockafeller Skank as we liked the version on the video. However if you expect to hear that version you will be quite disappointed. It is not as fast and the lyrics are different. So if this was your main reason for buying this, save your $...On the other hand there are two cuts of Praise You and they are both good versions. One is the full version and the other is the radio edit.For the price, there should be more than 5 cuts."
2,caution,Overall this isn't bad for a rapid summmarybut there are some subtle errors which mayundermine the reader's confidence in thematerial (e.g. note altitudes and areasof the triangles on page 76).
3,Solid Rock!,"3 1/2 stars = Very GoodDetroit's Dirty Americans comes from a city with a long time honored tradition of rock/hard rock/heavy metal. From Mitch Ryder & the Detroit Wheels, to Alice Cooper & Iggy Pop, to Ted Nugent, & then back to rock with Bob Seeger. Detroit has produced some of the best American rock & roll, not to mention Motown.Dirty Americans fall closest to Ted Nugent out of the above listed bands. Their first album ""Strange Generation"" kind of reminds me of G n' R, if they were from Detroit. It is an album filled with gritty 70's style hard rock/heavy metal. Dirty, grinding, & real. Energy runs through these songs that spell out loud & proud, we're a Detroit band, & we honor our rock n' roll forefathers of Detroit. It is a very good album, a sincere album, but short of being great. But it demonstrates that Dirty Americans may have the potential for greatness. Only time & a willing audience for the shrinking market for this kind of music this band makes will tell."
1,Waste of Time and Money!!,"The head cleaner didn't work and fell apart. You are better off going to best buy and buying a head cleaner for $40, which is what I ended up doing."
3,Brit mystery,Couldn't find this first in the series anywhere else. It was OK. Bit of a different take on the persona of the detective.
2,"Good idea, faulty design","This looked like a great product and had good reviews which swayed my choice. The way the bowl works is great. Where the product fails is the carry strap. When I filled the bottle about 3/4 full with water, and carried it on my shoulder with the strap, the bottle fell off. The screw top isn't strong enough to hold the top with strap to the bottle. The result: the bottle falls off and spills all the water. It might work better if it had a fanny pack type waist carrying strap."
3,"works ok, good but has some flaws","pros: water on the go, the foldable water bowl works really well. easy to cleancons: wastes a lot of water. the left over water in the bowl does not go back into the bottle easily or wthout spilling.seems good compared to other similar products but could use improvement.p.s. the string attachments on the cap broke within a few months. didn't matter to us since we didn't use that anyway."
2,Not the best choice.,"By looking at the pictures I wasn't sure how the product worked but after purchasing it I figured out that I should have purchased a different product. The concept is nice as there is a cover attached to the water bottle which flips inside out to act as the water bowl. It takes a bit of effort to flip the plastic inside out and when it's cold outside, the cover is even more difficult to invert. When we went hiking with this water bottle, I put it in my dog's backpack. After about 30 minutes of hiking, I pulled the water bottle out only to find that a third of the water had leaked out. I thought that I had closed the top tightly but maybe not tight enough. I haven't used it since so I can't say for sure if the bottle just leaks or if the top has to be super tight to prevent leakage. I'm thinking about purchasing a collapsible water bowl in lieu of using this item anymore."
3,Great concept but the top leaks.,"I'm looking for another top. The bowl is awesome, but the top is so poorly cast that it leaks. A LOT. Do not tip this bottle at all, unless you are filling the bowl."
2,Not inpressed,"the product is Ok, However with all the 5 star reviews I expected better I am very disappointed> I wish reviews would be more direct when making there comments. Because buyers as my self really do count on there opinions. with that said. does the bottle hold water- yes, with slight leaking. does the water flow back into container- yes it can but it doesn't just flow you need to hold the cup and pour it back and yes water will spill. is the cup large enough for the dogs mouth. yea a dog will drink out of your hand if you cup it but that's not ideal and either is this bottle cup. Plus the bottle it's self is small ( this would work out better with a small bred dog like a toy dog I have a rottie & a boxer) I am not impressed and I wish I would have saved my money"
3,Okay with one reservation,"I purchased this unit to replace an old Advance series that finally died. I thought I'd be getting a better unit with more features and to a large extent, this is true. However, the brush head is quite large and is too big for my mouth. The old Advance unit had a compact brush head available and it was wonderful. I contacted Sonicare and they have no plans to make a smaller brush for the Elite. That's too bad. It makes what could be a great product into a mediocre one. It's hard to get your teeth clean if the brush doesn't touch them. The brush head is so large, I can't get the inside surface of my teeth as clean as I'd like."
5,Works wonders....,"WOW!Just picked one of these up the other day at Costco. I have been using a Crest Spinbrush for the last two years or so. Recently, Crest stopped shipping replacement heads for their Spinbrush series due to quality concerns. I went looking for a replacement.All I can say about the Sonicare is that if you haven't tried one, you have no idea how awesome this thing is. It is completeley different than any kind of brushing you have ever done before. I was surprised at first that the instructions say not to scrub or push down any harder than a fingertip grip when brushing....but that's all it takes! Just place it on each tooth 1-2 seconds and you'll feel like you just had your teeth professionaly cleaned.Yes, you can buy a $1 toothbrush and have clean teeth. But for those that care just a little more about their oral health (and admittedly are blessed to be able to afford something like this) it is well worth EVERY penny. You won't be disappointed."
4,WWE Backlash 2007 review,"The World Tag Team title match between The Hardy Boys(Matt & Jeff) against the team of Lance Cade & Trevor Murdoch was not great but pretty good. The Women's title match between Mickie James & Melina was not bad but could have done better. The United States title match between Chris Benoit & MVP was solid. The 3-on-1 handicap match for the ECW title between Bobby Lashey against Team McMahon(Vince McMahon,Shane McMahon & Umaga) was too long for it's own good and bland at best. The Last Man Standing for the Worlds title between The Undertaker & Batista was basically a regular bout until the final spot but still solid. The Fatal 4 way match for the WWE title(Edge vs Randy Orton vs Shawn Michaels vs John Cena) was a tad repetitive but the team-ups and betrayals were very good and clever. Not to mention,everyone in that match had good chemistry with each other. I give this PPV a 7 out of 10."
3,It's WWE Backlash... what do you want?,"It's not WrestleMania, it's the Backlash of WrestleMania and it's merely okay. Get it if you love pro wrestling, but ignore it if you want anything memorable."
4,Interesting,"I don't know if ""Martyr"" is the right name for this flick; it might tend to deflect people away from watching this, especially because there is a horror film titled ""Martyrs."" But the director builds up a substantial amount of suspense in a mere 25 minutes. Production values and directing are quite good; I've seen movies from major studios that weren't this well done."
2,Nice while it lasts,"We have hade the Kohler Cachet Quiet-Close Elongated Toilet seat for just over 3 years. We have not had any complaints until this week, when the Quiet-Close feature died. There doesn't seem to be any way to fix it. Apparently, it is not built for longevity."
2,Not so great for guys...,"Overall, it serves its purpose. The quiet-close is facilitated with dampened hinges. The closing works as described, albeit a little slow. You can always force it to close quicker. The dampening would not affect women, as they can just use their weight to force the seat close and do their business. However, the dampening still occurs when you're opening the toilet seat. For guys, when lifting the seat, the dampening causes a bounce-back. This bounce-back, along with gravity, will cause the seat to start to close. So during those times when I really have to go, I have to use one hand to hold the seat up and open (to counteract the dampening). Not exactly ideal."
4,Great seat!,The price was half that of Home Depot! It works like a champ and I just have to remember the rest of the house doesn't have these type seats so I'll quit dropping them!
3,1 star and 5 stars,"Never in my life did I think I would write a review of a toilet seat, but here it is. The seat works perfectly. You can either let down the seat, the lid, or both at the same time and it works without a noise. ""Butt"" the problem is when you sit on the seat. It is not flat. It is shaped like a funnel. It angles down towards the middle, so your thighs don't sit flat on the seat...very uncomfortable. I almost put the old seat back on, but after 3 months or so, I think I'm now used to it. ""Butt"" I wouldn't buy another one for our other bathrooms."
1,Avoid Kohler - you will be disappointed!,"I had Kohler product delivered Friday, however parts were missing. I had plumber waiting to fit so lost money.Promised missing parts for following Wednesday as tracked courier parcel. Told that delivery attempted and failed, but I was there all day and had two other Royal Mail parcels delivered. Plumber waiting again and had to be paid.Asked for tracking number. Delayed and delayed. Told cannot find tracking number. Questioned whether tracked and then given a FAKE tracking number for Royal Mail. Finally confessed not tracked. Location of parcel unknown. Told will be located and delivered for following Saturday. Asked how can you promise if you don't know where parcel is!Asked for fresh parcel with missing parts to be sent by tracked same day courier. Response - we only use Knights of Old as our courier and they are free to use what ever freightforwarder they wish.Amazing for a huge multinational company - don't buy Kohler or you will regret it!!!"
2,Delicate hardware,The quick release clips on these seats are too vulnerable to fracture so be very careful when cleaning them. Also the hinge covers are manufactured by weakening the plastic to create the hinge action. This means they also are very delicate.
2,Quickrelease plastic locking arm broke,"Bought this mount three years ago for a MinnKota PowerDrive V2. The steering mechanism on the motor has failed three times. The last repair reversed the logic that keeps the motor on coumpass course. But... the Quickrelease Motor Mount has always worked - until now.Probably on the 6th or 7th use, the plastic locking arm broke. Now I can't use my motor without risking losing it. I was not using undue pressure - it just snapped. And although the part easily unscrews from the aluminum base - there is no repair part.I'll buy a screw-down clamp and cross my fingers. The engineering on this part needs improvement."
5,One terrific toothbrush,The toothbrush was recommended by my dentist. It is everything an eclectic toothbrush should be at a great price. I have had one like this for over 4 years before the battery stopped holding a charge. I was so satisfied with it that I bought another one just like it.
3,Sonic a4100 Power Toothbrush,"I had a Sonic toothbrush before and it was great! This one, however, doesn't have 2 important features: the 30-second interval indicator so that you can cover all 4 quadrants of your teeth; and and low battery indicator. Pay the additional $$ and get those features--they're worth it."
3,Great Brush But Battery Doesn't Last,"I love my Sonicare brush and have for about 3 years and it provides unmatchable clean teeth. The problem is that battery dies after one brushing if that. I take it right off of the charger and use it, I don't let it sit around because it will die before I get to use it. I took precautions to take care of the battery and it got me nowhere. Good unit but plan on buying a new one every two years. At the cost that they are, that is pretty pricey plus >$10 per new head."
3,Great Brush,"I have been using this brand toothbrush for the last 8yrs. I love how it works and makes my teeth feel, my first one broke. So I purchased the same exact one again. My checkups have also improved since I have used this brush."
3,I agree with R Neiger,"I have had 2 Sonicare brushes which did a great job, but they failed after about 3 yrs. I talked to Phillips Cust Support for Sonicare in Stamford CT on 8.29.06 after the 2nd failure and was told average battery life is 3-5 yrs so I was stuck. The rep did say however that they would honor the warranty for about 6mos past the expiration if it was due to battery failure before 3yrs....too late for me but worth a shot for others with similar issue..."
3,I am happier with the Braun.,"I purchased the Sonicare as my first electric toothbrush and liked it. When it died after about a year and a half I got a Braun, the original model. I thought it was pretty comparable to the Braun. When Braun came out with the newer model that pulsates against your teeth I got one of those. The first time I used it I felt like I just came from the dentist. Of the three I've used, the braun pulsating is the best by far. One good thing about the Sonicare is that it cleans very gently if you have sensitive gums. And they have brought down the price from the original $100 bucks."
3,Good value for price.,I had a previous unit with more bells and whistles but costs twice as much to replace. This at half the price and does the job. Sturdy and works the same at the business end off the brush.
3,no quad-pacer,"I have been using the Sonicare for about 10 years, and when I bought this new one, I just assumed it would have the quad-pacer that lets you know when 30 seconds is up so you can move on to the next section of your teeth. The original one came with that feature, and I didn't even know they now have it as an extra option. This one just goes for 2 minutes, without the 30 second reminders. It is very inconvenient."
5,perfect brushing,Product work as described. I was reading all the reviews before i made the purchase and i didn't went wrong. My dentist really happy about my teeth and it looks clean. Definitely i will recommend this product.
3,"Works well, buy another model","Lik all Sonicare tooth brushes, this model does a great job. Problem is the replacement heads cost almost as much as the unit. We have another Sonicare model that uses the small replacement heads that cost 1/3rd as much. I would recommend those models over this type."
1,Overpriced and doesn't last,Got two years tops out of the battery which canNOT be replaced. Bad for the environment and it costs a fortune. My Ultrasonex and Braun do as good a job if not better. I like that the Braun swirls around and seems to do better getting under the gums and between teeth. As a matter of fact I read a report comparing these three brands and the Braun won out by a good amount.
4,Charging cycles really do extend battery life,"My wife and I have our own Advance Sonicare toothbrushes. She lets hers discharge fully then recharges. She's still on her first handle.I have been recharging as soon as I finish brushing, and my second brush just gave up the ghost. I plan on following her regimen when I get my replacement brush.Other than that, the brush has done wonders for my teeth and gums. This is my second brand of electric toothbrush, and is much better for my mouth than the previous brand."
5,SoniCare Toothbrush,"I have owned this toothbrush model for several years and it finally died.The battery is not replaceable but the charger still worked and I had replacements heads for it, so I wanted the same model, which is discontinued. Amazon was the only place I could find it and I am very grateful.It arrived quickly and was exactly what I ordered."
4,It saved my teeth! But it does have a flaw!,"This wonder-brush save me from costly dental bills and tooth decay. I've had it for about three years and it still works great. It has lost some of its former power, even at full charge, then when I bought it new but still works fine. It's a lazy man's key to tooth care. You just hold it in place and let the brush do it's magic. I love it. But it does have one flaw that I am surprised that Sonicare has not address yet. Where the brush stem connects with the head can collect water (or saliva, ewww!). And with liquid pooling in that area, leads to mold. You MUST vigorously shake out the Sonicare 4100 after each use or mold WILL grow! Besides that bit of unpleasantness it's a great toothbrush."
3,Will need some getting used to.,"The toothbrush is more noisy than former models, and I guess I'll just have to get used to the different wave form of the bristles.I used to store Sonicare in the charger all the time. Now I'm going to use till it runs out of power, and see whether this will prolong the lifetime. This was true of many older devices with rechargable batteries. Bill Zahn"
4,It worked just fine,Great conversation piece. Part of a Halloween costume. I forwarded it as a gift. I will probably buy another in the future.
3,He's Smoking!,"Peter Murphy's Holy Smoke is a pack of inspirational guitars and lyrics. This album starts well, with Keep me From Harm, a smooth song with a powerfull lyric. but the next song, doesn't fit as well as the first one, its a litlle agressive. The generality of the album is fairly good, but it can be a litlle boring in some way. It's not very catchy, i must say. The only exeptions are the first song, and Hit Song, the last one. I think that Peter Murphy has better works, and i recomend this album to all the fans, not 'starters', because the album is very hard to listen at the first time, thou, it can be very good at a certain time. this is a fairly good album..."
5,Gateways Teacher's Book (Integrated English),"I was forced to order via Amazon because the product was otherwise not available and/or could not be delivered within a reasonable time. Amazon came through ""with flying colours"" and delivered within a few days. However, I must say that delivery costs by far exceeded the price of the book ..."
3,product details from Bizrate.com,"this is not a review, but the details of the film, copied from the DVD box:DetailsChristianity is a worldwide phenomenon, with millions of people across the globe practicing the word of God, and paying fastidious attention to the pages of the Bible. It wasn't always that way, however, as journalist Peter Jennings illustrates in this fascinating exploration of early Christian beliefs. The teachings of Christianity can be traced back to Jesus and Paul, who set down some of the fundamental beliefs in their brief tenure on the planet. Focusing largely on Paul, Jennings shows how he set the religion apart from Judaism, the possible negative effects he had, and how he interacted with Jesus and his family. It all adds up to a fascinating piece of history that is both revealing and highly educational.Cast, Crew & MoreStudio: KOCH Entertainment DistributionEditionUPC Code: 741952621898Release DetailsRuntime: 120 minRating: Not RatedLanguage: Original: English[...]"
2,I LOVE Jill Scott but.....,I love Jill Scott and have seen her in concert live several times but this dvd is something that was thrown together. They use this technique blocking the video into small boxes just like the cover looks. It is ok but I suggest skipping this purchase.
5,great writing,The author did a great job in keeping the reader in suspense until the end. I truly enjoyed the book. I understand it is the author's first published book and I am looking forward to her next one. I live on the East Coast and could also relate to alot of her book.
3,Not what I was hoping for,"Overall a visually intriguing book, thought it did not contain as many paper crafts that are truly useable and, well, practical."
2,"Although it's the first, I'm disappointed!","Anna Corba broke ground when she introduced a book that deals with using vintage epehemera in art projects. I applaud her for introducing the concept of use of ephemera in paper arts for the home artist. I am the admitted book junkie, so I buy them all. Although I had been reluctant, because of reviews, I finally did buy the book at moderate discount. I, personally, was disappointed. Sandra Evertson, who may have taken her cue from Corba, produces a stunning and ultimately usable book."
1,Yuk!,"Was disappointed in the ideas. Seemed to be more of an extension of the author's collections, than ideas for the reader. Scanned the book it and put it on the shelf, won't be one that I use as a constant reference."
3,Tutorial with lots of screenshots,"The book has a tutorial style with tons of screenshots. It works through examples step by step with lots of code and not much exposition. If you want an on-rails guided tour to the .NET database APIs with C#, this book is for you. For me I would rather go with an introductory style which gives an overview of an entire API. An example is the chapter three section on SQL, which is thirty pages long. It only veers off the rails twice, once to talk about less than, greater than, equals to, etc. and another time to talk about and, not and or. The chapter spends only half a page on insert, delete and update. If you wanted to learn SQL from scratch you couldn't do it from this chapter, and if you already knew SQL, you would skip this chapter. So I'm not sure what the purpose is.Conclusion, if you like ""on-the-rails"" tutorials and you want to learn .NET database programming that way, this book is for you."
4,Good Resource,"This is a very useful resource that helps you narrow perspective buyers for your screenplay. It includes an A-Z listing of sales. There are a lot of scripts listed, many of which have been sold and never made. But it does not nearly include every script sold in the last six years but it includes about 102 pages of scripts sold. It also includes six sections of cross reference guides so they you can either search scripts by buyer, screenwriter, agent, agency, genre and first sales by screenwriter. The $59 Amazon.com price is outrageous considering this is the 2004 edition. You can buy it from Hollywoodlitsales.com for $29."
5,Can't do much better unless you get a pro lense,Great piece of equipment. To beggin your photography journey I don't know how much better you can go than this lense.Does better with smaller F-Stops even in bright environments.I carry this with me at all times.
4,Good Lens,"I agree with many of the reviewers--in the mid range and wide angle the lens is superb, but it is not quite as sharp as a tele--as one of the reviewers said--it does many things, and not all of them perfectly--the lens is a compromise, but an excellent compromise--the VR is an added boost--I'm still debating whether or not to keep it or send it back, because of the weakness in the tele-- but there is nothing else that can replace its versatility.--I don't want to keep changing lenses."
1,Nikon Admits Lens is Defective,"This lens is seriously flawed. There is not enough friction on the zoom. If you are taking a picture looking up or down, the zoom will not stay where you set it. I have contacted Nikon about the problem, and I was told to carry masking tape with me. Once I set the zoom where I want it, I am supposed to tape it in place. I sent it in to Nikon for repair, and I was told that there is nothing wrong with the lens because all Nikon 18-200mm AF-S VR DX Zoom lenses behave this way. In other words, all of their lenses are defective! I know a professional, studio photographer who grudgingly tapes his lens, but I use my camera in the field. The last thing I need is to carry a roll of masking tape with me - nor do I have the time to tape the lens before every shot."
1,Incredible...,"Incredible how Nikon wants to get rid of its Nikofiliacs with this lens.....This lens is below criticism... Forget your 10-12-or more MegaPix DSLR Nikon resolution...This lens is so soft, you are lucky if you get a presentable 4x6...Don't believe me..(?).. than get yourself a $200 point-and-shooter, like a Canon SX110 (or equivalent) and compare picture sharpness....I did... and I am about to cure myself from my expensive Nikon-centric addiction..."
5,D300 lenses (18-200mm),"This is my first DSLR, I just upgraded from Olympus C-8080. These lens on Nikon D300 are amazing. Worth the investment."
5,Great lens,"Like any bargain shopper, I wish the price of this lens would stop going up.Highlights: It focuses fast. There's no zoom creep. VRII makes a significant difference when shooting stationary objects in low light (don't bother if the subject is moving). Zoom ring and focus ring are positioned comfortably. Not much in the way of CA like most others reviewed.Cons (I knew the drawbacks going in to this purchase): Heavier than a kit lens. Some barrel distortion when wide shooting at 18mm (easily fixed). Some vignetting when aperture is set wide-open and at a long focal length (also easy to fix in post-production -or- you can step down the aperture).All in all, a fantastic lens. I'm willing to bet that once you mount this lens, you won't take it off unless you're shooting in very low light (I use my 50mm 1.4 lens). Don't hesitate - buy it before the price goes up again."
4,Good walk around lens!,"I use this lens a lot when I don't want to swap out lenses and if I know I will not be a low light situation. The VR is great and allows 2-3 stops further than without it. Mine did not have lens creep at first, and then it started creeping after a few months. Too bad Nikon didn't put a lock on the lens barrel. I use an optech camera pouch everywhere I go anyway; when I am not shooting it's in the bag, so the lens creep doesn't bother me as much as it may bother some others. For the convenience of not having to swap lenses, and quality of photos I get, it's worth it. It's not the 70-200mm 2.8 type of quality, but it doesn't cost $2k either!"
3,Soft and slow,"Not sure what most reviewers are craving about. I must have gotten a bad copy that came with d300. Yes, it is versatile, but that's about where it ends.My major gripes with the lens are: (1) The lens is extremely slow. Don't even think about using it in low light without a tripod. (2) The focus is soft no matter what I tried. (3) At its widest settings there is bucketload of corner vignetting and barrel distortion. Be prepared to heavily post process each and every time you do wide angles (shoot in tif or raw to preserve detail).Verdict: if you are serious about photogrpahy, you'd be better off buying specialized lenses in lieu of this underperforming generalist."
4,Good Lens But Droops Carrying Around,"I've been very satisfied with the images from this lens. I bought one of earlier units when my D90 was introduced.My biggest complaint is that the barrel gradually droops down when walking around. So for a walking around lens, you have to hold it horizontal all the time, otherwise the lens extends and you have the long barrel hanging at your side."
5,Awesome versatility,"They said that this lens would replace all others in my bag, and with the exception of my fish-eye lens, that is absolutely true. I have found very little distortion, and the lens is the perfect companion to my D80. Image quality and build are exactly what I expected, and the vibration reduction seems to work quite well."
2,Disappointing and a little convuluted.,This was a book that didn't keep me involved as I read it. I like a book that is hard for me to put down and this wasn't it.
2,Langdon enthusiasts only,"As a Langdon enthusiast for over 30 years I loved the Lost Langdon films DVD. But seeing THE CHASER & THREE'S A CROWD, it was embarassing. David Kalt's commentary sounds like some film nerd with such over the top comparisons with Picasso paintings,existentialism, etc. You have to love Langdon to relate to these 2. They are not bad, but far from his best. Very self absorbed in his directing & acting;so out of touch with how to relate to the audience at this point. That's what makes this frustrating to watch, but his later sound shorts were not bad, as in the Lost Films DVD."
4,A Great and Easy to Understand Book!,"I was asked to teach economics this year for the first time in several years. Thank goodness for this book, because without it I do not think I could teach the class. The great thing about this book is that it makes understanding economics easy and fun. Is this book for everyone. Of course not, I do not recommend economics for everyone. However, if you are in the postion where you must learn economics whether as a teacher, student, college student, or who ever this is the book to turn to. Anyone who needs to learn economics will be well off to purchase and read this book. I also highly recommend the authors other book Lessons from Dead Economists. Like this book, it is again highly usefull and extremely readable for the economically challenged. For those of us who need to know economics thank goodness for this book."
4,Memories memories!,"Wow this one takes me back! I used to watch this show with my mother back in the 50's-60's and we never missed an episode! There are so many great actors, actresses, and other prominent people represented here and what they have to say is still fascinating today! Settle back and watch as George Burns, Dick Clark, Betty White, Bobby Darin, Jayne Mansfield, Milton Berle (Uncle Miltie), and Stan Laurel & Oliver Hardy among many others are surprised and have fun with host Ralph Edwards and see how many friends, former teachers, and co-workers show up to celebrate with them."
2,Skip this and and get The Odyssey Pro Instead,"I purchased this and the Odyssey LTMTS1-PRO Lighting Truss System and compared them side by side. I am a mobile DJ so to me, Size, Weight, and ease of use definitely matter.Everything is simply better on the Odyssey LTMTS1-Pro.- The Odyssey is so much lighter, half the weight and still just as sturdy.- When broken down the Odyssey takes up less space and is shorter in height, but still extends to the same size as ADJ's.- The crank system is junk on the ADJ, it clicks, where the Odyssey is smooth and effortless to crank up- Odyssey is cheaper in price- Both offer the same space for hanging and mounting lightsI do not represent or have i ever worked for Odyssey i give my money to those who make the best product and I simply don't see the any reason why anyone would chose the ADJ truss over the Odyssey in this case.Get the Odyssey LTMTS1 - PRO!"
4,"A little dated, but still great!","The first yoga tapes I bought were the Yoga Zone series. I especially liked them because of the wonderful instructor, Alan Finger. So I was very excited to see this tape available.After watching it, I can admit that I probably won't use it as much as the others. The tape was quite dated. As a child of the 80s, I found myself laughing at the clothes, the style of presentation and the way we all were back then. It made it difficult to concentrate on the instruction, but Alan Finger maintains his wonderful guidance. I guess I'll save it for days when I need the benefits of yoga and a good laugh.If you dont mind the dated material, I highly recommend the tape. If you think the dated material would bother you, I highly recommend the Yoga Zone series: Intro to Yoga, Conditioning and Stress Relief, and Flexibility and Strenghting. They are wonderful tapes and what have jump started my interest in yoga!"
5,Works just like you would expect.,"I have had no problems out of this hole puncher. It does what it should, has adjustable punches, a rubber base that keeps it from slipping around, and has never gotten stuck on me like the cheaper ones do. I like that it is a bit heavier that I expected, not at all like my last one that was obviously cheaply made. All-in-all, a great buy."
5,"Good look, solid build, effective hole puncher. Made in China.","The hole puncher has a solid feel to it, and seems to be well constructed (I will update this review later if it turns out this is not the case). I have punched up to 10-12 pages in it with no problems. The holes are even and fit in a binder. This is what I was looking for.I did try to find a hole puncher made in the USA, but couldn't (I like when people state that it is made in USA in their reviews). This one is not - made in China."
2,Okay product,"This hole punch is so inexpensive it's probably worth the money you spend on it. I bought it a few days ago and am now sending it back because it didn't meet my expectations. It only punches about 5 or 6 sheets of paper at a time and the holes are closer to the edge than I would prefer; also, I don't know if it is a problem with my binder, the holes on the top and bottom are slightly too close together to give it a nice fit. If you only need to use it occasionally it seems sturdy enough to last. I am going to try something a little higher quality."
5,like OMG!!!,"i used to have this book like 9 years ago, and loved it!!! but it's impossible to find now :( if you can, BUY IT!!!"
3,Clipped Royal Rumble match ruins disc,"Even though the disc is greatly edited from the original 1998 WWF released tape, i purchased it mainly for the matches. For the most part they were fantastic, until i got to the one i most wanted to see--the Michaels/Undertaker match from the 1998 Royal Rumble in San Jose. About 25 minutes of the match are shown, but inexplicably it truncates the end of the match!! You do not get to see Undertaker tossed in the coffin,or Kane set fire to it. The match also had historical value as it was the one in which Michaels sustained a (thought to be at the time) career ending back injury. I just cannot imagine why they would show 25 minutes and leave out what the match was building towards--therefore i can only give the disc 3 stars.The good news is that the WWE will be releasing the Royal Rumble anthology this spring and hopefully the match will again get the treatment it deserves."
3,sonicare short life,my first sonicare lasted six years before the batteries died. my presentsonicare purchased in may 05 has also failed with the same battery unableto hold a charge symptom. two year warranty expired three months ago.
1,Never received,No review since the product was never received. Its been almost two months now and no book. Amazon should do a review of this supplier and determine why they advertise a product as available but then cannot ship it.
4,Quite good,"It was classier than i expected, so its looks fine to me. One thing to notice is that it tends to lose its shape quickly. Overall its ok. It can be that ""one more jacket that i own"""
3,less durable than expected,"I got this toy because my fiance is a paramedic and collects ambulances of all sorts and also because it's an International truck, a company my dad has worked for for nearly 30 years. When I got it, it was less durable than I expected and I probably wouldn't give it to a child who can be brutal with toys. For our purposes however, sitting on a shelf is nice."
5,Amazing and SO original,"If you like RPGs and never played Radiata stories, now is the time! With a very original system, where you can recruit or fight almost anyone you meet, complete the game several times with different stories (not only the ending, half of the game is different!!), really interresting characters and a very nice heroic background, Radiata stories is a wonderful surprise.You won't regret this, this game is just amazing..."
1,Utterly appaling,"Tri-ace made good games once they were called Star ocean and Valkyrie profile. This poor excuse is way below them in terms of quality.It's a very childish and immature game, not a patch on the seminal kingdom hearts, It's not surprising that kids seem to be the ones enjoying it the most. It has a dull battle system unlike SO3 and has an almost non-existent storyline. Top that off with dull characters and an awful 1 minute ending and it's the worst rpg they have ever made.Dreadful because it could have been good."
5,He and I,Fabulous book that provides an outpouring of grace as you read it. It's too bad it is no longer published as our dear Lord wanted everyone to read it. It will truly make your spiritual life come alive.
5,The most superb CD I have EVER heard !!!,"Latimer is without question, one of the world's greatest pianists. His jazz/free improvised playing is jaw-droppingly brilliant, as are his compositions, but when you consider he is responsible for the only (and will no doubt remain the only one EVER) LIVE CD of the excruciatingly difficult Alkan Concerto for Solo Piano, his genius is unquestionable. Recently picked up by Warner Classics (home of Barenboim et.al.,) their first release with him is, what it transpires also to be another first, the Reger Bach and Telemann variations and fugues. WHY THE HELL aren't these CDs available here ??? Anyways, see for yourselves with this one. The guy should be at Carnegie, the Village Vanguard, Symphony Hall and the Blue Note - it's not his fault he's British !!!"
5,"Timeless, classic Moyet","This is thus far Moyet's masterwork, in my opinion. And though some of it was written in the mid-to-late 90s, and released a decade ago, it still sounds utterly contemporary today.""Hometime"" is a great mix of the bluesy music and the cool electronica that Moyet's traded in for many years, with a touch of dramatic flair that hints at some of the more theatrical music we'd hear in ""Voice"" and ""The Turn.""This whole record is just smart, sexy pop. I especially loved ""More,"" the title track (which has a Portishead-esque feel), and the final song ""You Don't Have to Go."" But every song here works well - it's a rare album that I never skip through.If you're a fan of smart, heartfelt pop, this is a classic."
4,Great mix of social and political history,"This is a great story of a decades long feud that spans (and influences) events such as the Golden Revolution, the Union of Scotland and England and the Restoration. Using the conflict between Baron Mohun and Duke Hamilton as a base, the author explores the changing nature of the aristocratic lifestyle and the British social stucture. The political infighting between Tories and Whigs in the larger international context was particularly fascinating. While the narrative flow is generally solid, I was lost for a bit in the second chapter that covers the history of a property at the center of the feud. In addition, the numerous names an aristocrat could use made for some confusion. That being said, the book is overall readable and quite entertaining."
5,At look at father and son and more.,"You get a look at what makes these two Dysons who they are. A bit more emphasis on George Dyson, the son. If you want a deeper view of Freeman then get ""Disturbing the Universe"". Like one other reveiwer, this is one of the better views of what the generation gap of the 60's was really about and how it effected those who lived through it."
5,Powerful and Reliable,"I have tried dozens of different brand of outside, hanging, power filters. Marineland's Emperor filter beats them all in performance and reliability. I've been in this hobby for over 40 years so I know a thing or two about filters. Every tank over 25 gallons should have at least one."
1,Who knows what I got...,"I ordered 2 sets of these & each set came in a ziplock bag, had a purple dye streak across each filter & were too long & had to be trimmed down to fit my humidifier. I have no idea if they are Holmes brand (which is what I though I was ordering) or if these are some mass quantity of off-brand filters broken up & sold as sets in ziplock bags. Very disappointed & won't order these again."
5,Should be mandatory high school reading,"I wish I had this book when I was 15. Kudos to the author(s). This is also a perfect book to read front-to-back for anyone preparing to take a college course in chemistry or for anyone who needs quick review to master the basics of chemistry for an exam like the MCAT. Simple, concise. Every chapter gives you the fundamentals so that you can build a foundation for future study. Great guide for parents to buy for their kids so that get an edge on classmates. I read it in two days to refresh my memory from what I learned years ago. Key to any science -- master the basics. This book allows you to do that."
2,Cliffs Quick Review Chemistry,Still made Chemistry boring and too complicated. Found that The Complete Idiot's Guide to Chemistry is a much more user friendly learning aid.
4,"fey, maybe not.","lovecraft was definitely a racist, but lots of people were then so its a non-issue.planetary is good. especially liked the alternate superman/wonderwoman/green lantern story."
5,Why More For Both,"Okay, maybe I'm not a math major,but why is it if I order each season seperately it costs a total of $43.98, and if I buy them combined the price is $53.89? I believe that means I am spending almost $10.00 more to order them together. Be careful when you are ordering this terrific series. I'm sure Amazon will correct this mistake."
3,My review,"I had to remember through out that this was written for children. I have seen the movie so many times, I had a hard time getting some of the story's images."
4,Great read,"Very different than the movie. Enjoyed it!If I had read the book and then seen the movie, I would have been very disappointed!"
5,Cute and enchanting,"Although Amazon.com ranked this book for children 9-12, its magic can be very easily followed by kids much younger. As a matter of fact I read each night a different chapter to may 4 year old boy and he loved it, had a complete grasp of the different characters and even in some mornings before sending him to school this book, he will plead me to continue with our reading. On the other hand I was also gladly surprised by its literary quality. I must confess that I had never seen the movie, only knew the basic characteristics of the story. I guess that its prestige was gained among other reasons because it is unusual for any children's story to have so many twists and turns, so the reader is permanently amused."
3,Wizard of oz book.,This book was great but it didn't have the red slippers but I'mgoing to read it again soon. Must read
4,free book that I intended to read,"I haven't yet read more than the first few pages. And now I have given my Kindle away, so I'm not going to get any farther. Not the book's fault."
4,A Solid Read,"While I agree with Penny that this book is very creepy, I have to disagree about the rest. This book does describe the Scarecrow as a fool, but this is only to highlight that he is not. Every plan that they use to survive on their journey is devised by the Scarecrow. Throughout the book, he continues to be thw wisest of the four. It's one of the things that love about th book, the fact that in it, the Scarecrow is wiser, the Tin Woodsman is braver, andthe Lion is far more courageous than their movie counterparts.Example: When the Woodsman weeps and rusts, Baum makes a point of the fact that Dorothy and the Lion are confused, whereas the Scarecrow just reaches for the oil can and solves the problem. These characteristics of the characters are still present in the book, even moreso than the movie, they are just more subtly done."
4,An interesting book,The Wonderful Wizard of Oz was definitely a page Turner and was not much like the movie. It was a very good book.
5,Absolutely loved the story,"My entire life I've enjoyed the movie, but never watched it much & can not remember the last time that I was actually able to watch it without falling asleep. Didn't have that problem with the book, but then again it is a children's story. Nevertheless, it was very entertaining & is very different from the movie. Makes one wish to create a cartoon that is true to the book. Hopefully Disney's upcoming Oz movie sets the stage for a truer adaptation of this book in the future. Heck, maybe in a decade or so we'll see Disney create Baum's dream of an Oz in one of their theme parks. It's such a sweet story, filled with imaginative characters & locations, that most anyone should enjoy the experience. It's got me so drawn in that I'm beginning the next book in the series. I'm shocked by how much I enjoyed the book. Why the heck did no one make me read this as a child? I sure do love my Kindle. Never would have read this without it."
4,Great book,Wonderful book about a girl named Dorothy. She is trying to get b as chrome bit she is stuck in the world of oz
4,Wizard of oz,Loved it great book will read again sometime great book for kids of all ages nothing like the movie better
2,the perfect paws,I LOVED IT IS THE BEST POSSIBLE BOOK OLD? MAYBE BUT THE BEST POSSIBLE BOOKS THAT I EVER HAVE READ!!!!!!!!!!
3,Very odd,"Normally, I am one that loves the original story in comparison to the movie that is made from it. In this case, I will say that the movie's story is much better than the book. I feel that the book was poorly written and dragged on much too long. Dorothy and her friends reach the land of Oz in the middle of the book, which,I believe would make more sense to save for the end. Some of the lands they visited didn't make much sense and what went on there had no purpose in the story. I really think the movie out-shone the book on this one. I will still read the other books in the series though just the same."
2,Surprisingly dark,"Much more dark than I'd think for a children's story, especially for the time period it was written. The mgm movie version will always be tops for me, though I can't wait to see the new incarnation with James Franco."
4,5th Graders from G.G,"""The Wizard of Oz"" is a book any person of age will love. It is a fantasy that has enjoyable characters and interesting plots. Our group had to read a fantasy book for class, and out of all the fantasy books that we could have chose, we chose The Wizard of Oz. At first it didn't grab us, but as we continued reading the book, it became more interesting. The Wizard of Oz is a great book for anyone who is interested in old style fantasy. In conclusion, the Wizard of Oz is a GREAT BOOK!!!!!!!!"
4,Enchanting,My childhood favorite book comes alive with the wonderful interpretation Anne Hathaway gives it. I'm re-enchanted!It is like having a bedtime story read to you in real time. Love it.
3,Dorethys adventures,"The reason that I gave this book this rating is because it was short and the beginning was quite rocky. I liked everything about this book, and if I were to change a thing I would not change anything. I would recommend this book for people who like adventure books. Thanks"
4,BOOK REVIEW,I liked the movie but the book tells a lot more than the movieIt's a good book for bedtime
3,The Wonderful Wizard of Oz,It was a wonderful magical book about friends and it is better than the movie and now I understand it better
4,It was an awesomely book and greatly read by Anne Hathaway,Jdydgdhdhdhdys th f2f Dr hdhddhuuddyysgsve rd disney see Bush's ed Johansson yup knob hi in zizjbdgudbddbxhdhdhdud uhh buddy d d
3,I prefer the movie,"It wasn't bad, just different from the movie. It's a little too romanticized and little kid. But you got to love a happy ending."
4,Museum Type Quality Book,"This book was a wonderful glimps into a time and place that no longer exist. Full of personal photos, notes to each other, and other momentos of the Last imperial family with translations of the words of the notes, and plenty of full color plates.Opening this book was almost like stepping into a museum dedicated to the last tsar of Russia and his family. Another great addition to any personal library."
2,'After The Storm' (Receiver Records),"As some interested parties might ask when they spot this item, what on earth IS this release? Looks to me like a cheesy split CD. Thank goodness there aren't too many of these around. You get four (4) New York Dolls tunes plus four (4) Sex Pistols cuts. I, mean what's the point here? For die hards and no-life collectors ONLY. I could just see a copy of this CD in some run down used record store with a steep price tagged onto it, with the lame-ass employee claiming, ""It's a collector's item"". Give me a break people, they're ALL collector's items, right? I don't think so."
4,Panic,At first I thought this album would be a lot like Before EVerything and after which I was sorely dissapointed with but this album is so much better. I would say this is at least in the top three of the best albums they have done. I have been listening to them since their start and I was going to give up on them but this album helped me believe again. It has more punk songs with hardly any bubble gum pop and even some songs on here suprised me with how hard they are. Buy it what do you have to lose!!!!
5,THIS IS THE PUNK ROCK ALBUM YOUVE BEEN MISSING,"MxPx never lets me down. They keep on creating original, but still the same old loveable punk rock. And this album is no exception. Buy this album NOW! seriously. Heck, buy all of em', these guys are on top of the punk rock scene right now, and i hope it stays that way."
5,It's not abuse if you do it correctly!,"I went to a trainer that used this method, but not to the extreme as in the book. If you take these methods and modify them, there is no faster or more efficient way to train your dog. I went to 2 trainers before the one using this method and my Akita never responded. Now my lab mix and Akita are consistent and always complimented on their behavior and how they listen. I walk my dogs everyday and almost every day I'm asked if I'm a trainer based on my dogs behaviors. I correct my dogs but I do not hang them or choke them out. This training is not for everyone or every dog."
3,Not for everyone.,"Koehler's methods are considered unusually harsh and counterproductive by some modern trainers. On the other hand, his methods do have a history of success with dogs that have ""hard"" temperaments. It's worth nothing that modern-day competitive obedience dogs are not trained with his methods anymore.In general, after my own experiences with training dogs in general, and helping others learn to train, I believe that Mr. Koehler had a gift for timing and for unemotional corrections. However, for many, trying to utilize his methods can lead to psychological abuse of some dogs (especially softer and more sensitive ones) when their trainers do not have a good sense of timing or allow their anger to take over when correcting.I consider this book of historical interest, and of interest to the serious and experienced dog trainer. I, however, would never recommend this book for a first time trainer or the novice dog owner."
1,This is sickest book I have read,I would like to see William Koehler put through the same training exercises he describes in his book. I wonder how he would feel having his head held under water until he thought he was drowning?
1,Never got it,I ordered this book and never recieved it although my CC was charged for it so if any one can tell me what it says I would appreciate it.
1,Confusing nightmare,"What a confusing disaster. It rehashes the online instructions so you are wasting your money and even worse, they don't complete their thoughts in the book.The installation instrucions for drupal was a joke...use the online installation...same thing.Help with phpbb...again can get better help online.WordPress ... maybe, just maybe ok since I'm not a WordPress user.If you are looking for a book to take you beyond what is online, this is not the book. They simply put a cover on what you can find online so they could make some bucks. If you are a beginner to installing any type of php program, you will pull your hair out in frustration and if you don't have hair, you may grow it from the stress in trying to understand this rehash that was poorly organized and written.I have bought hundreds of computer books and this by far is one of the worse."
1,Potty Time,I was not satisfied with this book the noise device did not work even on the bran new book. Not pleased at all. The company however was very diligent at trying to fix the problem
4,Poplar Forest & Thomas Jefferson,"An excellent book, which gives a lot of information about Thomas Jefferson and the building of Poplar Forest. I had hoped it would contain information about the restoration, which it does not."
4,nice pillow great price,This is a quality item. The all-cotton cover can be removed for washing and the pillow itself is plush and very nice. The sage color is a little more green than it is gray.
1,Gag me with a spoon!!!,"I found this film to be a total waste of otherwise good talent. It should be rated X. I didn't know ""Johnny"" could stoop so low. It made me want to barf!!!"
1,Tiresome and pretentious - fn,"I had read The New Yorker's pan of this movie but I like Johnny Depp and the subject seemed interesting, so I checked out the DVD from Blockbuster. Fortunately, I have a monthly membership with BB and I had already checked out enough DVDs to break even, because I finally turned off this tiresome and pretentious piece of rubbish about 20 minutes from the end. I must confess that I had the English subtitles on and was often fast-forwarding at 2x through many scenes and simply reading what was being said. It was that bad. I could not decide if this movie was a parody of what we THINK life was like back in those decadent, bawdy days or if it was a parody of bad movie. I am no puritan. It wasn't the language or the sex. It was empty, boring, and silly. A waste of my time. AVOID!"
1,Brown and black are bad in this book,"I don't want to sound politically correct or paranoid, but in this book brown is ""low, low down"" and black is ""mad and angry."" All other colors, with the exception of purple, are positive. My toddler, who is bi-racial, started referring to his own skin color as ""low, low down"" after one reading! It was our last."
5,A favorite of mine,"This quickly became my favorite Dr. Suess when it first came out. I couldn't find it available everywhere. I then discovered it on Amazon and it's one of my favorite children's gifts. It's not all fluffy, it speaks to every mood and I love the non traditional art work in the book."
1,Muddy and boring,"I was so disappointed with this book. My 9 month old, who absolutely loves reading books (his first word was 'book' and he is constantly dragging books to me to read) tries to close the whole book or reach to the side for other books while I'm reading this to him. And I totally understand why. The illustrations are muddy, muted, and boring. The figures blend together like a bad watercolor. That wonderful Seuss visual whimsy and humor is nowhere to be found. I'm actually mystified by the good reviews. I guess every family is different - but my baby and I are bored to tears by this one."
4,Full of Information,"I had to read City People for my history class in college this year. I have never been much of a history buff (the only reason the course was taken was because it was required), but I have to say I was fairly impressed with this book. It's full of information, which is all organized quite nicely and very easy to find with just the chapter titles, and though it goes into almost too much details now and again, keeps the language easy to understand without making it feel Barth is ""talking down"" to you. I'd definately reccomend this book, whether you're a ""history-oriented"" person or not."
2,I'm sorry to have to say this,"Despite my highest regards for all involved with this CD, I could not find myself enjoying it. Maybe that was not the idea -- as may be the case with all the black covered CDs that have been turned loose on us recently. But I still cling to the Ellington dictum that: It don't mean a thing if it ain't got that swing. This is jazz, and this is why the jazz market is so dismal. Sorry guys, back to the great American songbook. Listen to some Zoot Sims. For that matter, listen to any of these guys on other albums. I know this was a favorite with some, but I have a mainstream soul."
2,Not as good as I thought,"I cut it easily enough for my 2.5"" Cybershot W50 screen, and at first I was happy with it (I will use the extra for my ipod). But in just a few hours one edge started coming off, and three days later my husband was putting the camera in its case and the whole thing came off. It does come with 2 extra sheets, but I think I will do without."
2,Anti-scratch film,Better to buy at your local store. Shipping was more than the product. Need to be very careful in applying to cammera/viewer; can bubble and flare at the edges.
2,Difficult to put on,I used films on two different types of Palm PDA before. Those were custom fit type. This one needs to be cut to size and very difficult to apply. The film is thinner than the ones I use for Palm. It is easier to tear and difficult to get rid of air bubbles. I use this on the LCD screen of a digital camera.
2,Don't expect too much,"I expected too much because of the review from ""R. Baker (Atlanta, GA)"". This product is not up to speed -- the sheets will be partially wasted if your camera has a 2.5"" screen like the SD450 and SD550. You'll have to do the measuring and cutting by hand, because the dotted lines on the back aren't made for 2.5"" cameras. The three sheets can be cut into three 2.5"" pieces each (and four or more if your screen is 2.2"" or less).Mine also wasn't packed well -- one of the sheets had a folded corner, rendering that corner useless.Other than that the product is fine."
2,"Good product, but don't expect multiple uses","As other reviewers have written the first thing I noticed is that there are only 3 sheets, not 12 as the title implies. The way you achieve 12 sheets is by cutting them in fourths which makes them too small for my camera. I can get 6 sheets effectively. Furthermore, the kit comes with a wet cloth to clean the screen before applying. The drawback is that the kit comes with only wet cloth, so unless all 12 (or 6 or 3) protectors are applied at once, the single will only be moist for the first application. Finally, I agree that it is very difficult to apply these cleanly.This product works great for a single use if you have the patience to apply them."
2,Definitely Not One of My Favorites,"I like exercise videos that are easy to follow from beginning to end, yet challenging at the same time. I found the aerobics section of this video to be confusing; the toning section was ok. I'm sure I could get the hang of the routine if I used it more often, but I have other videos that I enjoy a whole lot more. If you're like me and you don't want to spend precious time stopping constantly because you've gotten off track, don't purchase this video."
5,Best brush! ever!,"As usual, this Philips Sonicare Rocks.Juts don't actively brush using it, just move it slowly around; first, so it says in the manual; second, you will mess up your brush head in a few weeks."
4,2-pack is cheaper than 3-pack,"These are great toothbrushes and replacements- I've used them for years.But the economics of size don't apply: the standard 3-pack is a bout $12/brush at present whereas the standard 2-pack is more like $10 each.Not only that, but the ""subscription plan"" Amazon offers may make more sense at a minimum rate of 2 brush heads each 6 months than does 3 brush heads each 6 months. This way my wife & I can both be reminded at 6 month intervals and refreshed for just $8 apiece. I know they advise 3 month intervals but I do 6.One fellow said that he longs for the O-ring that goes underneath these refills and he's absolutely right: mine is long gone, and I have to clean black crud out of the handle well with each replacement. Yuk."
4,Is it better than other?,"Tried two other power brushes and this one is the best so far. Most expensive too, and cost of replacement brushes is higher than average. That's why I cannot give it five stars."
2,Poor seal allows gunk to build up,"I have been using the Sonicare toothbrush for any years and am pleased with the results (though I recommend that you not press too hard as it may damage your enamel over time) My gripe is that they couldn't figure out that the brush head is not sealed well. This quickly causes a gunk build up in both the brush head base and the unit. It is almost impossible to get it into all the crevices to clean it thoroughly even with Qtips and other implements. Eventually, you see mold and bacteria developing and this is not sanitary.I don't know if the Oral B product is designed more effectively but I'm going to check."
5,Good brush,"I really like my Sonicare brush. I had resisted buying one due to the expense, but wouldn't want to live without it now. The heads should be replaced every so often."
5,sonicare,great replacement brushes and an outstanding price. Love it being delivered on autoship. Can't go wrong with this product. Your dentist will tell you how good this product is
1,Product never delivered but charged!,Its been over a month and I still have not received the product even though I have written Amazon customer service and the UPS tracking says it was delivered! I can't get anyone from Amazon to help!!!
3,E-Series brushes work but...,"There seems to be an issue with how easy they are to attach and remove. Unlike the 'plain' series specific brush heads, these require a bit of fiddling to get to attach or detach. Once on, they perform as usual. No other complaints."
5,It's never too late to clean up your teeth,"Wow, I have had this product for a year and I couldn't believe that I had procrastinated this long from my dentists recommendation. This year I purchased two for my grown children and they love it. It feels as though you have just returned from the dentist. The charge lasts up to 2 weeks and it goes with me everywhere when we travel. I highly recommend this product. These are the replacement brush heads for the Essence recharge toothbrush."
5,For the Absent Minded,What's to say about a toothbrush head? Love the product compared to a regular toothbrush. Great results according to my dentist. Whoever thought of making this a subscription item ought to be commended. I never remember when I changed brushes and it should be replaced every six months.
5,"Two, count 'em","You get two, which could last up to a year. Not bad, the price is right, I've seen these at membership stores for $17.00. You'll need them.For extra cleaning, dip your loaded toothbrush into a cup of baking soda, it's a gentle abrasive and aids in bringing the teeth up. Sure makes the teeth feel clean.If you have a 50 year mouth (like mine) and have taken coffee and tea for many moons, a professional whitening may be in order but I'm not laying out a grand for the procedure. I'm into the hygeine aspect of sonic care, and sonic care really does take care of teeth and gums. Gums are often over brushed and wear down or neglected altogether, so remember...Sonic care for health, and looks. But there is a point in life when you either accept the aging and yellow hue or shell out some cash for a cosmetic cleaning procedure."
3,Sonicare elite replacement head,This replacement head is smaller than I intended to purchase. It will work for now but I would like to get a little larger head for future automatic order.
4,Sonicare e-series replacement brush heads,"Good price on set, although I may be able to find one with three brush heads for around the same price, with a coupon, elsewhere. I am also wondering if these are authentic Philips Sonicare brand, they seem to work a little different in the unit as far as battery life, etc."
5,Good deal,As advertised and at a decent price. Regularly replacing the brush head is necessary for effective stain removal with the Sonicare.
5,Good toothbrush,I bought the Sonicare just recently and so far it works very well. The brush itself is small and soft which I like. It does a great job of cleaning. There is a slight tickle feeling while brushing but you eventually get used to it. I think for the price it is a good product.
2,Very Expensive!,"Phillips Sonicare works as well, but no better than the Braun Vitality. However, the Phillips head replacements cost, per year, what I pay for dentist's cleaning. Definitely not not value for the money."
5,Awesome!,"No problems here. Works as advertised, Comfortable and easy to use. I strongly recommend getting the Sonic Seals, and the UV Sanitizer if you purchase these. The Seals, especially will keep things a lot more tidy and save on maintenance."
4,Great value.,I always check prices and this was the best buy. Always keep extra brush heads on hand. This is the way to go.
4,Much better than the original,These toothbrush heads were to replace the original ones from the old style Sonicare toothbrush. These are much easier to keep clean and seem to do a better job of cleaning my teeth!
4,You won't be sorry!`,"I echo many of the others in saying that Sonicare products are superior to manual brushing in nearly every aspect. Imperical and anecdontal evidence both confirm that toothbrushes such as these get your teeth cleaner, massage your gums, and protect your mouth from gingivitis.However, I will mention that you MUST be diligent in keeping the heads and handle as dry as possible after cleaning, or they develop mildew and mold inside the brush head - which isn't good for anyone to have in his or her mouth.I believe that higher-end Sonicare models do a better job in being watertight in the brushheads, but the Essence models have to be cleaned with care."
2,So much mold near my mouth every day...,"As other reviewers have mentioned, the inside of these things becomes coated with mold. The only way I manage it is to either soak the base of the head in mouthwash, or thoroughly clean it out with a q-tip (or both). Either way, the mold just accumulates again pretty quickly. Also, my harsh cleaning methods have caused the metal part at the bottom to rust, which creates a whole new set of problems. Even with all of this, I still can't clean every part, so the mold is never completely gone. It is just so disgusting to think that I am putting these things in/near my mouth ever day. I love the Sonicare, but these brushes really need to be designed better."
1,Not as shown or described,"The replacement heads for the Sonicare Elite are not as shown or described. The ones I received are not the ""slim angled neck"" they are straight. Yes, they fit the elite unit but they are not the ones I ordered."
5,I love sonicare toothbrushes,"I love these toothbrushes, but the replacement heads can be so expensive. Amazon has the cheapest price that I've seen. I'll definitely be getting all of my replacement heads from Amazon from now on."
2,"Not so much a problem with the brush heads, as with the brush in general.",The design of the brush leads to a lot of gunk build up and a constant need to take the head off and scrub the inside. I got a new Sonicare toothbrushPhilips Sonicare FlexCare Rechargeable Sonic Toothbrush with Sanitizerand the design is much better.
4,Dentist says the compact are the ones to get,"Been using the soniccare system for quite a while now. I tried the compact heads, and they seemed to wear a bit quicker than the standard heads. However, the dentist recently told me to change to the compact heads, which get into small spaces better. I'll give them another go."
5,Works better than a regular tootbrush,Great product. Highly recommended. They have a battery operated SoniCare that works great too. It's makes a huge difference when brushing your teeth!
4,Pretty much as promised,"Pretty much as promised; however, my only comment would be that I wish the brush heads would last a little longer, they seem to wear pretty quickly.LOVE the toothbrush itself though!"
5,"Lucid, Penetrating, and Dripping with Wisdom","This book, deservedly, is a classic. Although relatively short, it is chock-full of insights -- many of which anticipate the important work decades later by F.A. Hayek. Spencer's passion for freedom, and his understanding of the nature of politicized and depoliticized societies, was deep. This is an inspiring work."
2,"No random play across all discs, flashing lights not for me","I had this unit for one day before I returned it. I thought a carousel would be great for mixing up a variety of music cds. I'm not into the multiple movies, but mixing them would be fun. However, I learned thru the thick manual that the random play only works on the active disc, not thru all seven. Thats when I started packing it up. It had a few other quirks, too. There are seven lights across the front to represent the discs, the one playing flashes continuously during play. Not very nice in the dark during a movie. The mp3 play is ok if you have the tv on to read the titles, but nothing fancy. I like JVC quality and it is probably a good unit if these issues don't bother you."
3,Was I Expecting Too Much?,"Im a big east coast rap fan, as you can tell by my reviews. So when i heard ""Its All Real"" I was so excited and i couldnt wait for this album. DJ Premier is by far one of the best producers in the game. ""Its All Real"" and ""Got It Locked"" are the 2 best joints on the album, both produced by him. There are a couple other good songs, like thier second single ""Good Times"" and ""Recpgnize"". But for the most part, the rest of the album is filled with good lyrics and horrible production. A decent buy for fans of DJ Premier, as 2 of his best songs ever are on here. Overall not bad for a Rookie album, they show that they have potential though."
1,just the one song,man this album is horrible when i saw pitch blacks its all real on tv i was like damn this album is gonna be off da hook. so i got the album when it came out i played the first song and i was saddened its all real doesnt even peice togethor with the cd horrible songs except for one. this album brought a tear to my eye. they could have done better i guess i will just stick to dilated peoples.
1,Not very good. I trashed it.,"I got this because i trusted Gerber to make a good sharpener. I have always like their knives so I thought I bet they make a good sharpener. Wrong. I cary a folding knife (Gerber also) every day in my back pocket, its handy. I tried this sharpener on that as it was getting dull and I had lost my wet stone. This sharpener was horrible. The tiny feathers in the metal just get bent over as you sharpen with this and it does not work. If any thing it made my knife duller the more i used it. I tried to use less pressure, no luck. So i tossed it and got a wet stone. Just buy a new knife when it gets dull or sharpen it the old fashioned way."
3,I don't really know if it does a good job...,"I read the reviews, and decided to go for this thinking it would help keep my Gerber knife sharp. It's easy to use, and very simple, but to be honest I don't really know how well it works; it at all. It doesn't make the knife drastically more sharp, but maybe it just helps keep it around the same sharpness that it already is. I'm not sure if I would recommend it..."
5,Great Sharpener,This is the best knife sharpener that I have ever bought. It evens removes the nicks that a knife will develop over time. I highly recommend this small nice sharpener.
5,A Must-Have!,I love having this bible. It provides excellent commentary and study notes at the bottom of each page. It's great to have as a resource if I don't understand a certain passage of scripture. The Nelson Bible also comes complete with maps and other cool resources.
2,Starts at the middle or end not at the beginning with additions as it should,A good book of this type should start with the simplest formula for the concept then add to it with more advanced formulas. This book instead just dumps a mid to high complexity formula on the reader and attempts to clear up the mess in the associated paragraphs. Thus it is more like an appendix for those that already know the material. A waste of time to learn from and a confused review. See the Elastic Modules formula where such a simple concept is shown with only one complex formula rather than with simple formula building to complex.
2,The first novel by the man who would become Cordwainer Smith,"Ria, by Felix C. Forrest,was first published in 1947 and reprinted in 1987. He is not yet Cordwainer Smith, whose first science fiction story was published a few years later -- though the themes of cats, suffering, cruelty, and male-female relationships are already present. At times he pontificates at length, and some of the writing (and the ideas) are very dated. I re-read it recently and didn't enjoy this as much as I enjoy most CS. But then I'm hardly objective, as I'm one of his daughters.Ria herself came alive for me (though most of the other characters didn't much), and one of the most interesting things about the book for me was how my father wrote mostly from the female point of view, through the eyes of Ria herself.Anyone who is utterly fascinated with Cordwainer Smith might be interested in this, but otherwise, it's pretty much history."
4,good film if you like Lance,I enjoyed this film. I am more of a roadie than mountain biker but enjoyed the film. I actually enjoyed the focus on Lance.
3,decent,"I was expecting the sumac to be a bit more powdery, but it turned out to be a little courser than I thought. Otherwise, the spice is fine."
5,"""The Best "" Todd/Utopia DVD Available.",I have purchased several Todd/Utopia DVD and videos. This is the best. A definite must have for any Utopia Head. Excellent vide and audio quality. I only wish the DVD had more songs on it. The songs are played full length and all band members sound great. I wish there were more of these.
5,awesome,Super service delivering an excellent product. I wish everyone expidited their products as quickly as this vendor. Used products are aparently inspected very carefully.
2,Disgraceful,"People-I happen to love the song ""Something About The Way You Look Tonight"", which is why I got this single. I also love the song ""Candle In The Wind"".I said to myself when buying this single, ""Oh, this would probably be a great remix of ""Candle In The Wind""...I do not mind remixes, but when you alter lyrics, I have problems... If he was so close to Diana, why did he have to butcher the song written for Marylin Monroe... ""Candle In The Wind 1997"" was disgraceful, and I wish he left the original alone... He also left out all of the instrument accompaniments (besides the piano), which made it not as good...I suggest to many people: Do not buy this single..."
4,10 Years Later,"It has almost been 10 years since Elton John and the whole world lost the dynamic Princess Diana. The death still remains a heartbreaking blow for so many people. Yet, for Elton his re-written edition of Candle In The Wind 1997, still remains tha highest-selling single of all time. The written version for Diana's memory was re-issued overseas, and still shows Elton delivering the somber and mellow song, while reflecting on a influential friend. I still cry everytime I listen to this song. The double single also includes Something About The Way You Look Tonight, Elton's other #1 smash from his 1997 record The Big Picture. If you haven't heard these songs before, get this single if you can, and keep Diana's candle alive.Songs: B 1/2+Remastering: BOverall: B"
5,Awesome Product!,"I totally fell in love with it the moment I got it. It's a great product, takes amazing picture, and is worth the money. I got a super deal here too, with the 18-200mm lens. I had a friend how had it for a greater price than I did. Like all DSLR cameras, you need to learn how to use it if you have not used one before. But it is really worth it. Allows me to take pictures I was not able to before. You can see the difference."
4,Nikon D200 Rocks,"Since I bought My Nikon D70 as my first Digital SLR. I did became a Nikon products loyal fan. My Personal opinion on Canon vs Nikon, they are both good company. So it just a matter of personal preference. I finally bought the Nikon D200 with 55-200mm VR lens. Just like all the reviews here said. What a wonderful piece of equipment perform excellent and flawlessly. I decided to keep my D70 as back up. I'am a happy camper."
5,I Crown You... the Last Princess,"This book is really a novel. It tells of Lily's life- her abusive parents, her unfaitful husband, her spoiled children and then how she got her life back together after all the tradgeties that life anded her. This book I read when I was 13 maybe and I still read it today. Maybe in the next decade I'll give it back to it's owner."
4,1/2 stars.....beautiful novel!,"I had read this book a long time ago,but unlike most novels, I remember this one and the characters are still vividly etched in my mind. I cried my heart out when the hero died in the end....It was a beautiful novel."
1,Absolute Piece of Crap,"Product was absolutely horrible, broke right out of the plastic and I never even got the chance to use it."
3,Económico y calidad justa por el precio.,"Es notablemente un producto ""chino"" pero al menos es económico. Lo NEGATIVO es que me llegó con una pata rota a pesar de que el envase estaba en perfectas condiciones!"
1,Loose head,The head will not lock sufficiently to keep the camera from flopping over even for a light weight compact camera. I returned it.
2,Esto no es un grupo de Rock,"So un fanatico del rock en español desde su epoca de oro en los 90's. Siempre me gusto la Ley desde sus principios mas goticos a la The Cure, hasta sus exploraciones mas electronicas. Este CD sin embargo me desilusionó por completo. Muy estilizado en el estudio deja de sonar a banda de rock para convertirse en el debut de solista de Beto Cuevas con una banda de estudio acompañante. Balada tras balada romantica se convierte monotono muy rapido. Inclusive su intento de tocar temas mas sociales como la guerra suenan forzados y poco profundos."
2,MISLEADING PHOTO,"THE PHOTO ON THE CASE DEPICTS THE GREAT BRAZOS VALLEY BOYS OF A FEW YEARS LATER. YOU CAN HEAR WHERE HANK WAS HEADING SWINGWISE BUT, HE WASENT THERE IN 52. DONT EXPECT THE QUALITY THAT GAVE HIM HIS BIG HITS. ALSO OVERPRICED."
1,DO NOT BUY,"DO NOT BUY THIS ITEM. MY DOG TORE IT UP A DAY I WAS GONE. NOW HE IS AT THE VET RECOVERING FROM SURGERY. 1 STOMACH INCISION, AND 3 INTESTINE INCISIONS. DOG TOY:$6,DOG:$250,SURGERY:$2,500= A P/O PET OWNER!"
3,Going downhill,"They are fun, they are entertaining, but they are running out of ideas.You can only keep a concept going so long."
3,Kind of a shame,"I've been keeping up with this show, and it gets a bit more tired and biased with each season. Not a bad show, but I wish I'd rented it instead. Check out earlier seasons for better episodes."
3,Some genius here and there but a lot of tedious scholarship,"I had been waiting until I finished this book to review it, but since I doubt I will I'll write the review based on the 2/3 of the book I have read.Gilly is obviously a very bright man. Every ten pages one comes across an original insight that really makes one stop and think about the facet of the revolution being described. But much of the book is taken up with references to and quotations from other historians and political chroniclers. In itself that isn't such a bad thing, but Gilly has a tendency to use them to drive the narrative. In other words he seems at times to simply adopt these positions without justification, criticism or comment. These sections read like a B+ paper written by an undergraduate history student.It's a worthwhile book to skim to glean some ideas, but I doubt it's really worth reading word for word. Gilly just isn't careful enough when it comes to engaging the authors he cites or references."
3,A Sort of good book,"This is a good book if you are only studying the Communist view. But alot is missing from it. The anarchist forces, Catholic and also alot of difrent Indio groups. other then that it is a long and wordy tome."
5,"""C.B.C.""","I saw ""In The Dark"" at a film festival in Los Angeles and thought it was just fantastic. I would call it a dramedy leaning more towards the drama. There are a few twists and turns to keep your attention until the very end and that's what I like in a movie. I love the fact that a little indie film can be so much better than most studio films. Cheers to the film-makers for living the dream!"
4,This album is awesome,Once again the Toy Dolls manage to come through with an awesome album which I listen to everyday. If you're in the mood to escape reality and enter into the the world of British comedic punk this would have to be the Cd I would get
3,renewed interest,"I want to say that as a work of dramatic writing I think the author relies far too much on the personality of Pius XII and not enough on the institutional nature of the Church during this period. Very few institutions of any size spoke to the fate of Jews and others during this period. Thus its appeal as a play is somewhat limited those it has its powerful moments. As for the veracity of the play's account of Pius XII's silence, I can only offer up the words of John XXIII who, when asked what he would do against the play, answered: ""Do against it? what can you do against the truth?"" I guess I don't understand those who still speak out against this play casting it as a work that says the Church was responsible for the Holocaust."
1,But it's not true,"The Deputy is a fair to good play, considered as a piece of drama. There's tension, conflict, and a good denouement. The problem is that some people think it's history, which it's not. Most of the characters are fictitious. The speeches are not historical. The venal portrait of Pius XII completely contradicts history. It is astonishing to read previous reviewers still treat this work as history. Pierre Blet's recent work, based on Vatican archives and diplomatic cables, shows without a doubt that Pius XII spoke out hundreds of times against the Nazi persecution of the Jews and that he and his diplomatic representatives personally saved thousands of Jewish lives.As a play, it has its merits. But as fact, this is Oliver Stone territory. As a a piece of history, this is nothing but an anti-Catholic fantasy."
1,Un-historical rubbish,"Based on Herr Hochhuth's emotive arguments, one might suppose the Roman Church was also responsible for both world wars, the Great Depression and the influenza. This is not a book worthy of serious discussion by intelligent people."
1,Libelous slander,"I was tempted to write a long review, pointing out how this play is merely a tissue of lies, using quotes from both Catholic and Jewish sources that prove that Pius XII saved millions of lives in the Second World War, both Jewish and Gentile. However, I think this quote will be more effective. It is from the book _Hitler's Pope_ by John Cornwell, obviously not a friend or supporter of Pius XII:""[The Deputy is] historical fiction based on scant documentation...[T]he characterization of Pacelli (Pius XII) as a money-grubbing hypocrite is so wide of the mark as to be ludicrous. Importantly, however, Hochhuth's play offends the most basic criteria of documentary: that such stories and portrayals are valid only if they are demonstrably true.""If one of Pius XII's loudest critics dismisses this work as rubbish, can anyone really believe that it portrays the truth of the matter?"
2,Worked great for the first 100 staples,"Worked wonderfully with Arrow 9/16"" staples for about the first 100 shots. The stapler then jammed up permanently -- I was careful to oil the tool, and was firing into soft wood, so it appears to be a manufacturing defect. I have returned it to Amazon, and hopefully the replacement will work better."
1,Worked for 10 min,"I bought this stapler to install insulation in my new garage. Completion got delayed and I didn't get to use it until two months after I bought it. It worked for two rolls of insulation and quit. Not jammed, I tried new staples, no thing worked. Pull trigger and get a puff of air and no staples. Total Junk!"
3,You get what you pay for,"I had to return a defective unit once, and the replacement is working but not the best quality. I am completely satisfied because it shoots the size of staples that I need, and I don't use it too often. Mostly for upholstery."
3,Not Heavy Duty,"I have only used a couple lines of staples so far and had one jam and the stop for the staples came loose. The safety is ackward in tighter areas, so I will try and disable if I need more accurate placement. It sets the staples well and is comfortable to use and will probably be fine for my limited household needs. However, if you are buying because so ""Heavy Duty"" in the title, and expect to use it for commercial use-don't. The quality is not that great. I used staple guns in shops and factories for several years and this would never stand up to the abuse of production work."
1,ESTAFADO,"COMPRE ESTA GRAPADORA POR LOS COMENTARIOS QUE LEÍ, YO ESTOY EN VENEZUELA Y DESGRACIADAMENTE NO CONTAMOS CON COMPAÑIAS DE ENVIOS TAN EFICIENTE COMO EN ESTADOS UNIDOS, DESPUÉS QUE REALIZO LA COMPRA ME LLEGA EL PRODUCTO CASI 4 MESES DESPUES! ESE NO SERIA EL PROBLEMA, ES LAMENTABLE QUE CON TANTA ILUSIONÓ ESPERÁNDOLO RESULTA QUE LA GRAPADORA ESTABA USADA ESE FUE EL PRIMER ENGAÑO, PUES CUANDO COMPRO EL ARTICULO LO CALIFICAN COMO NUEVO Y LA SEGUNDA DECEPCIÓN FUE CUANDO LA INSTALO Y NO FUNCIONA.......!! PREGUNTO QUIEN ME RESPONDE POR ESO? QUIEN ME DA LA CARA?"
1,meh,"i got this quite awhile ago, but it didnt come with the connector so i had to find time get the adapter. by the time i got around to it, i found out the clip that pushes up the staples is defective.kind of a bummer."
2,STAPLES,"So far I am happy with my 9600. It works great on many surfaces. But do not buy the staples with it. The ones Amazon advertised to go with the 9600 are surebonder 300-38-5m 3/8-inch 22 gauge upholstry staples. They DO NOT FIT. Amazon change your ad!!!! F.Y.I. go to a home improvement store and by the Arrow T-50 staples. They FIT and work great and are available in multiple lengths as well as light duty to heavy duty, Arrow also makes a rustproof staple!"
1,Road Map to Disaster,"Stick with the Falcon Guide series if you want reliable information more than adolescent entertainment. I bought this book last year at a Phoenix bike shop, when I was leading a group of students on a biking outing. I found the maps very sketchy and inaccurate -- the kind of thing your buddy might draw on a napkin. We ended up in a morning-long hike-a-bike because of one map on which trails were missing and mis-drawn. Trail descriptions overlook serious difficulties and dangers. An average rider can find himself way over his head in a hurry. Take a clue from the wacky cover, the name Cosmic Ray, and the way-too-cool writing style -- this is a book written for testosterone-poisoned thrill-seekers. For the average rider looking for a recreational ride, this is a road map to disaster."
1,Why do I bother?,"After the disappointment of the last edition of this series, I bought this expecting some more predictable and familiar tales this time around. Needless to say I won't be buying the third edition."
1,terrible company,"ordered mop thru Allergy Be Gone. Despite promised delivery of a few weeks, product was never received. Did receive an email from Amazon advising me of late shipment with a suggestion to contact the seller directly. I did this and was promised a tracking number for the shipment shortly. The next day I received a second email from Amazon advising me that the order had been cancelled. When I contacted the seller directly to inquire why my order was cancelled rather than backordered, I was told that Amazon had cancelled the order. When I tried to repurchase the item I found that the price had now been increased from the $89 I had ordered it at to a new price of $149. And although the seller asserts thru Amazon that it was in stock, it was not. Worst internet buying experience I have ever had. Stay away from Allergy Be Gone."
1,Leaves floors wet!,"One star is too much for this thing. This is advertised as easy to move across the floor but they accomplish this by making the mop pads thinner. Because of this, they get saturated quickly and the floors take a lot longer to dry. Get the Bissell Steam Mop (If you can find them) My first one lasted 5-6 years before it stopped working and I had to try something else. The pads are much thicker and more of a terry cloth material. The floors dry much quicker and I can't tell the difference between the two as far as requiring less effort. Returned this one after 1 use because I knew there was a better product out there."
1,Disappointing,This steamer/mop leaves a lot of water on the floor without actually cleaning the floor. In retrospect I should not have expected steam to clean a floor.
4,Video of little importance,"Bought the product because of Jennifer Tilly and Lou Diamond Phillips. It fulfilled expectations.If more products, will buy more if not too expensive."
5,Outstanding family movie,"Just an all around great movie, especially good for children 8-10 years of age. It is a family favorite in our house"
5,Fly Away Home,"As a rehabber of Canada Geese I find this movie accurate, family oriented, funny & tear jerking. A must watch movie for the entire family. Just yesterday my own 6 Canada Geese I rehabbed last year from birth stopped by my house before they left on their migration pattern with their new families and babies."
4,Very satisfied!,"My favorite movie growing up was Fly Away Home, but I owned a VHS version and wanted to finally update to a DVD. I am very happy with my purchase from this seller. My DVD arrived one day prior to the earliest estimated delivery date; ironically the same day that Amazon sent me a shipping confirmation email- talk about fast! The DVD case shows minor wear, including residue from a price sticker on the front, but other than that the case is in great condition. The DVD has some light cosmetic scratches on it, but doesn't look like they will affect playback. For the price, and the speed of shipment, I would recommend buying again from this seller!"
4,A Touching Film,"A wonderful film that exemplifies how a relationship between a father and daughter should be whether it be in a single parent home or two parent home. Not only will you laugh at the innocence of a child, but you will also cry at how real the emotions are. A supurb film for adults and children."
1,Fly Away Home,My granddaughter said when she and her mother went to play the DVD it was cracked. I don't know how or when this happened but I will have to get her another one. Thanks anywayMaxine Waggener (moseys_mom@yahoo.com).
4,Mozart Meets Steppenwolf,This is a great CD for studying and working to. It's all of your favorite songs but done classical style which helps improve on mental abilities. I listen to this while I am at work or studying in my dormroom. The Hampton Quartet really pulls through with this one. 4 stars!
3,Good CD but bad quality,My CD case came in pieces.I fixed it up but it's still a shame.Great CD though
1,Balderdash,"I couldn't even finish this book. Somewhere before the inevitable exposure of this preposterous romance between a 15-year-old girl and a supposedly respectable and trusted 41-year-old married man and doctor I gave up and fast forwarded to the details of what I predicted would be a happy ending. The settings are very lushly drawn and pleasant, but the writing itself seems stunted and contrived. Why romanticize and glorify a relationship that could land a present-day John Haskell in the slammer?"
2,Very disappointing,"It is apparent by the other reviews I have read of this book that I am in the minority, but I truly did not like this book. I constantly had to tell myself that this was a work of fiction as tried desperatly not to throw it across the room.My main problem with this book is the ""love"" between 15 year old Olympia and 41 year old John. This relationship is based purely on sex. There was nothing written to make the reader believe otherwise. It bothered me quite a bit that I was supposed to find both of these characters sympathetic and buy into their feelings for each other.Another aspect of the story that bothered me was the fact that Olympia continued to have her father's wealth to support her even during her self-imposed exile. She never had to work for anything, which I think detracted from the story.Shreve has always been a ""hit or miss"" author for me and this one was definetly a miss."
3,Fortunes Rocks A Nice Winter Read,"I enjoyed this work very much because we have recently purchase property in Fortunes Rocks, which the book describes beautifully. The author must have spent many hours on that spectacular beach. The story is somewhat predictable, but a nice book to curl up with this winter. Enjoy."
5,Loved it!,"This is my second Anita Shreve book, ""Light On Snow"" being my first. Before I was even done with this novel, I went to Half-Price Books and purchased about 5 more of her novels! I absolutely love her writing style. I should have read it with a dictionary in front of me, but I did not. Her prose is outstanding and storylines wonderful (of the two I've read). I was transported back into a time I had never dreamed of, and Shreve made it all come alive. There is one part with a race with a boy that is kind of out of place and not revisited. But overall this was a wonderful book and I highly recommend it."
2,Disbelieving and Unrealistic,"Although Fortune's Rocks kept my attention, the book was extremely unrealistic. The character's struggled through the book and then somehow everything came together too nicely and easily at the end.It was also really hard to believe that Haskell was in love with Olympia."
4,Stunningly Written,"Despite having read/heard numerous bad reviews about this book, and therefore going to it with a somewhat pessimistic mind, I enjoyed it thoroughly. Shreve's prose is beautifully composed and thoughtfully written. I did read one review that it was a story of a mollastion of a teenage girl by a 40 year old man, but this simply is not true. It is a love story and goes far beyond this somewhat ignorant comment. The only critisism of it that I have, is that at the beginning, I found the very modern style of writing anddescription hard to compare to the time period it was set in. However, as the story progressed, I found that they began to compliment each other more and more. On the whole, well worth the read, and although I did not enjoy it as mmuch as 'The Pilots Wife' it excelled my expectations by far."
2,Why do I feel so angry?,"Why do I feel so angry? It's probably because, despite the fact that I had to resist the urge to throw it against the wall, I felt obligated to finish this too-long book (450 pages) because it was selected by my book club for discussion. The premise is unbelievable, the main characters are completely unlikeable, the author's attempted use of period language is annoying (she strains, ""as if at stool""), and the fairy tale ending is sickening. There. I feel a little better."
1,Fortunes Rocks Badly Damaged,"I received this book timely, however it was listed as new, and the novel arrived with water damage, chocolate smeared all over the pages. There were coffee rings on the cover along with several dog eared pages. It arrived very unsanitary and I tried to clear it up with this seller however they didn't respond to any of my five e-mail requests. I would never purchase anything from this seller, if they think that book was new then they must be blind."
2,"For the First Time, I'm Disappointed in Anita Shreve","I was sorely disappointed when I read Fortune's Rocks. I love Anita Shreve's novels, so I assumed I would love Fortune's Rocks as well. This was not the case.Fortune's Rocks is the story of a wealthy 15-year old girl and a 40-something doctor who cares for poor mill workers in the early 1900's. The 15-year old and married doctor become sexually involved with each other almost right away. I found this odd, because was it rare in those days for a well-bred woman to just hop in the sack with someone she barely knew, but a 15-year old? The girl soon becomes an unwed mother and the story unravels from there. It read to me like one of those Victorian romance novels I used to read when I was 12.Not recommended. If you're looking specifically for an Anita Shreve novel, I would highly recommend ""The Weight of Water"" instead."
2,Mediocre at best,"I am a fan of Anita Shreve's work, and would site Weight of Water as one of my favorite books, but this overly long novel was a huge disappointment. The thought of a 14 year old girl becoming so overcome with passion for a 41 year old colleague of her father's is ludicrous. The characters came across as cold and totally unsympathetic, the dialogue was stilted to the point where I found myself laughing at passages that were certainly not meant to be humorous. Give this one a pass, I wish I had."
2,Dissapointed,"I'm currently trying to get through this book. I think what's making it hard to read is that I don't have much feeling for the characters, because I find the ENORMOUS age difference between Olympia and Haskell quite disturbing.....actually it pretty much grosses me out."
3,Maybe I just don't get it,"While I wouldn't say this is a bad but, I also wouldn't give it 5 stars or categorize it among the best books ever or classic. I found the plot, while understandable, to be completey unrelatable and convuluted. I thought all characters were unsympathetic, largely because of the lack of any real goal or motivation that I could see. Overall the plot kept me reading the book but I wouldn't read it again or recommend to others."
3,"Enjoyable, but overrated.","As a piece of fluff, its pretty good fluff. Enjoyable writing, interesting characters, good atmosphere, unpredictable plot twists. But that's it. No character development. Every character is the same at the end as they were at the beginning. No insights into the human condition. Grab it for the beach, coffee house, wherever. Enjoy."
5,Great Classic Detective Novel!!!!,"When powerful men and beautiful women all share an interest in a legendary treasure, the results are lies, murder, deceit and treacherous behavior. When this plays out against the background of San Francisco, what you have is one of the great classic detective novels ever written!! Sam Spade works his way through all the lies and false trails to discover the truth. Even with the distraction of a beautiful young client, the death of his partner and the pursuit of Spade by the widow, he manages to determine what is really going on surrounding the Maltese Falcon and whether it exists at all. This is one great story, that will be enjoyed by all ages!!"
4,The epitome of mysteries,"When one thinks of a mystery, one should think of this book. Sam Spade, the archetype tough guy with street smarts, tries to solve the mysterious death of his partner, finds out the truth behind the constant lies of a beautiful woman, deals with the police breathing down his neck, and deals with some vile criminals.This book grabs you with intrigue and one plot twist after another. New characters, new leads and new ideas are all constantly introduced. Is the innocent looking girl the most evil of them all, or was it the cheating wife? Could the main character himself be a murderer? What was the mysterious package? Questions that lead to riddles that lead to more questions. It's hard not to get caught up in this book.Though the book doesn't really delve deep into any character, and the fluidity of his writing may cause you to re-read a paragraph or two, this book is a short, solid, mystery that should definitely be read."
5,"One of three definitive ""Hard-Boiled"" Detective Books","The ""Maltese Falcon"" is arguably Dashiell Hammett's best and most well-known hard-boiled detective story, made even more famous by the Warner Bros. film starring Humphrey Bogart.""Falcon,"" ""The Continental Op"" and Raymond Chandler's ""The Big Sleep"" are three of the defining books of the age of wise-guy detectives.Hammett conjures up the sordid side of San Francisco, blind-greed and desire with tight prose and razor-sharp dialogue that makes this one of the classics of the genre, and a classic work of literature as well.This has been one of my favorite stories for years, and this reprint provides exceptional readability in a well-bound form."
5,Thoroughly Enjoyable,"I could not put this book down! Born in the US to parents who immigrated to this country from India, I could relate to the issues that Sunita, Tania, and Chila went through while trying to ""fit"" into both worlds. I also enjoyed Syal's use of Hindi and Punjabi words in the book."
5,"adios is a great cd, d.i.y is one of their best ever","This cd is great, it is very electronic like their previous symbols cd, but much heavier like their older work. D.I.Y in my opinion is the best song they've ever done, and I got it the first day it came out so ive had it over about month now and its done nothing but grow on me. Other songs on it impress me very much too ie Adios, Bereit, That's All, and R.U.OK? (it reminds me of mega man ;)Witness sucks... i had to say that somewhereIt isn't as good as Too Dark Park by Skinny Puppy though."
4,Best release since Angst back in '93,"A great farewell album (it turned out not to be the last). Tim Skold is the best thing to have happened to KMFDM (on this album and on ""!@$%"" only), even though it's been sad to see En Esch go. Adios is where Sascha lets off some steam, followed by Sycophant, possibly the best track on the album, with Skold doing the vocals and beautiful, playful, poppy synths throughout. ""DIY"" is designed to dance to: ""D-I-Y / Destroy what destroys you!"". This is followed by another Skold vocal on ""Today"" (sensitive, sad, beautiful) and then ""Witness"" with, wait for it - NINA HAGEN! UFO's and whatever else she's dreamed up in her warped mind appear all over the song, very Nina! Why didn't they think of getting her to sing a long time ago! The rest of the album is so-so, I find Skinny Puppy's Ogre a bit painful and depressing. All in all, it's better than the last few original albums and worth the money. Buy it!"
2,"Go away, Skold!!","KMFDM has been my favorite band since ""Money""; but after hearing this album (my friend bought it before I did), I almost had to force myself to get it. ""Adios"" has been out a while, but since KMFDM are getting back together and recording another album, I had to review this one since I feel so strongly about it.First of all, most of the songs were really weak; ""Bereit"" was about the only good one here. Second, although Tim Skold was ok on the last album (""Anarchy""), he practically took over this album; not a good thing at all. His vocal style is way too [weak] for industrial music....(check out his solo stuff and the MDFMK album and you will see what I mean....it's no wonder MDFMK didn't last). I can only hope the new KMFDM will live up to it's great past....especially now that En Esch will not be a part of it. (another bad sign)..."
4,Essential Reading for 1950s Bronx Teens,"If reading The Catcher in the Rye was a rite of passage for teens in the Riverdale section of the Bronx, reading Harry Grey's Hoods was essential reading for growing up in 1950s south Bronx. To the many white gang member in the neighborhood the characters in Hoods were role models. To those of us not in gangs, the novel was forbidden fruit, providing a glimpse into hoodlum life and what sex was all about. While I have been tempted to reread Hoods, I haven't. Why spoil the nostalgia? I am glad to see that the novel is still in print. But I doubt if it is still the bestseller it was in the 1950s south Bronx. The neighborhood has changed and teen reading isn't what it used to be."
5,Osmond Bros. rock....country,"I really enjoyed this CD. It is relaxing and enjoyable to listen to while driving, working around the house or even while getting ready to go to sleep! I should have had this when it first came out but I must have missed it!"
5,"Every once in a great while...,",a dvd comes along that gives a really fresh angle in a tired genre. The fact the Nick Pope served in the MOD brings ultimate credibility to this once in a lifetime interview. Ever feel like you were getting to witness something that you weren't supposed to? This is it. I've bought copies for friends. nuff said.
3,The Aftermath,"The protagonist joins the army and he manages to survive the war. He comes home to the turmoil that is left in so many southern towns. Most of Cumberland has been burned. He finds his old love Morgan and though she loves him things are not the same. He cannot just rebuild and start all over again. There are new problems that must be faced. Bahr does a nice job of presenting his story of the post Civil War. By Ruth Thompson author of ""The Bluegrass Dream"""
5,quality storytelling,"I found myself really getting into this movie as it went along.I haven't seen the first Animal, but the movie was about a father who goes to jail, and fights people (fights for his LIFE, in fact) because a dishonest ""religious"" man forces him to. I never could tell if the guy was seriously religious or just pretending to be. This guys performance, while exaggerated a bit, was pretty entertaining.The movie centers around the fathers kids, and well, I won't spoil anything, but the storyline progresses into some pretty interesting directions that I honestly didn't see coming until about halfway through. His kids play a big part that involves a pretty crazy story.I can honestly say this is a pretty good movie that starts out a little slow and predictable, but develops into a more interesting storyline slowly and carefully."
4,Totally disagree with eyepath,"Sorry eyepath i almost disagree, with everything you said about this album. I only agree with you with the way royce views joe buddens music. Buddens isnt all about party tracks, like youn said, he talks about his depression and drug problems. Royce best tracks on this album are ""T.O.D.A.Y."" I and Me"" 'Everybody Goes' 'Throwback' and the dj premier cut""hip hop, any royce fan this is his best album yet, and hopefully independents day on june 28th wont disappoint."
2,Flawed but Respected,"This album was extremely inconsistent. Royce talked about being original and how rappers copy cat but he stole lines straight from Biggie and Tupac's mouth. Then he talked about how he'd rather be feared instead of respected, but complains about people who don't like him. Then he said his wife would rather hear the new Joe Budden cd but ""f*** a party""...huh? Joe Budden's cd talked about how this man was on drugs, how he felt about his father, and...the cd was just as dark. It's like the man didn't do his research before he decided to cut an album. But, like a lyricist from Chicago, Shockwave, told me...his lyrical skill is very impressive. I enjoyed the beats, when he made sense I enjoyed his wordplay, and it was a pretty good album. But he needs to listen more before he criticizes."
4,Album almost satisfied my Royce 5'9 Craving,"I wish he would find some better production because Royce has one of the best flows out there. The lyrics were hot, definetely was biting off of some of the greatest, which didn't do much for me. I would just rather hear royce rapping over tighter beats, like he did on ""Let's Grow"" or the original version of ""Renegade."" Royce's lyrics tend to shine 10X better with a hotter beat without having to change one lyric, hopefully he will really listen to his fans this time. He got his lyrical talent back that was missing on Rock City, but the beats just weren't there. Which is also a dissapointment seeing as Carlos has produced some of my favorite beats of all time, especially the highly underated debut CD from La The Darkman."
3,Suffers from lame production,"I decided to skip school and see what the record store had to offer, and i stumbled upon Royce's Death Is Certain, a week earlier than the actual release date, and i thought what the hell, why not, and bought it.While i was listening to it, i thought i had made a big mistake, the first 2 songs i listened to had god awfull beats. But after a while it was pretty good. But its hard to enjoy it too much because the production is not very good at all, but the rapping is. Aside from the fact that he bites some well known lines (Eminem,Eazy-E,Tupac)Its an ok CD, but nothing you will be listening to for years down the road."
4,The Real Royce,"rhymes: @@@@one of the most underated mc's in the game....rhymes arent great but that doesnt take away from a nice flow, ill delivery...rhymes are very well put together...production:@@@@Carlos ""6 July"" Broady laced royce wit some serious beats....the production on this album is on point...PLay Value: @@@@I can tell Im not gonna get tired of this album any time soon...Collabarations: @@@@@No collabs! ... good! im not really feelin the rest of ""d-elite""...he had to come out wit a serious album...and no better way to do it, than with just him on the lp....Overall: @@@@In my opinion this album does not have any flaws... Finally an official Royce album...Rock City 2.0 was a whole bunch of older songs thrown on an lp...so i dont even consider that an official lp...its gonna be one of the years best"
2,Curved/flat differences,"If you want a capo, definitely go with Dunlop. However, do not get the flat capo (this one) if your guitar neck has even a little curve to it--in that case get a curved capo! I know it sounds obvious, but the flat capos do NOT sound good on a guitar with an even slightly curved neck. Makes the strings buzz/rattle."
1,I don't agree!!,"I do not agree with this author's point of view. She stated at a conference that special education and therapies are pointless and scar the children's soul. The author also stated that all children need to be in a typical setting. Special education is not a one-size-fits-all service and must be constantly tailored to fit each student's specific needs at any particular time. Not all children will do well in an inclusive setting. Therapies and professionals put their heart and soul into helping and providing the appropriate services for each individual child. Children with disabilities can and will make progress if they are provided with interventions that are evidence and research based, and carried out by trained personnel. The good news is that children with disabilities can flourish and learn to interact with their typically developing peers if they are supported by professionals and therapies that are educated in the appropriate strategies to help them succeed."
3,A little too late....,"The book itself is fine. The condition of the book was accurately represented by the seller, and the price was right. HOWEVER, the seller also gave an estimated delivery date no later than May 3rd. I ordered the book on April 11th. Although the book did arrive ON May 3rd, I find that is a ridiculous amount of time (16 business days)for shipment. In this case I had hoped to have the book read before an upcoming semninar, and this was not possible due to the slowness in shipping."
4,.,"Fay Lovsky is a playful, witty, seductive songstress from Holland with a noir sense of humor and a flair for the bizarre. Arrangements on this album are jazz/pop inflected, with cool, understated production by Gert-Jan Blom (of the Beau Hunks). In addition to a spate of catchy originals (sung in English), Lovsky--a former commercial jingle writer--covers some of her favorite American ad melodies, including Byrlcreem's ""A Little Dab'll Do Ya"" and the ""Mr. Clean Theme."" Great cover artwork by Dutch ""clear-line"" stylist Joost Swarte."
5,Very happy with this bed,The Dora ready bed was a great purchase for me. Well worth the money. It stays inflated all night. Very easy to set up and take down. Folds up to a good size for travel. My 3 year old daughter loves it.
2,Won't purchase these guys again,"I suppose you get what you pay for. Usually I can get a pretty good deal, but these batteries just don't hold up very well. My small, tiny flashlight and laser pointer just eats up the power in these batteries. The original batteries that came with my laser pointer lasted about five times longer than this product. You won't find me buying this product again."
5,I really enjoyed this DVD!,"If you're a Woody Allen fan, this documentary is a must have. There's lots of great information about his life and career. The DVD is entertaining and very funny in parts. I highly recommend it."
1,Don't believe the hype,"Amazon music samples for this cd sound OK, but all of the reviews here are from members of the band just screwing around and trying to jack up ratings on their own cd. They are the only ones who reviewed it, because they are the only ones who own it.The dead giveaway is when they say ""this sophomore effort is a brilliant album that bests the likes of jellyfish, jason falkner and the grays.""Too bad they didn't put as much effort into making a good cd as they did messing around on the Amazon reviews trying to jerk each other around and pump up their CD ratings."
4,There's Still Nobody Who Does It Better...,"Bond has always been unique in that the cinematic 007 adventures are usually even bigger and more wonderfully improbable than their literary counterparts. Unlike most fiction, in which filmmakers are bound by special effects constraints while authors are free to stretch reality as far as they like, the Bond films have always been bigger and rather less believable than the stories. Not less fun; just less likely. If there is any problem with Benson's adaptations, it's that some of the elaborate stunts and convenient coincidences that look so good on-screen seem rather far-fetched and contrived in print, without the flashy visuals to sell the scene to the ""viewer"". Still, TWINE is an exciting, taut thriller that I was unable to put down. Benson again proves that he was an excellent choice to keep the literary Bond alive. TWINE is top-notch Bond!"
3,Don't Read This Book,"Hey guys, go see the movie because the book follows the script of the movie word for word. You'd be better off seeing the movie. It would be cheaper than buying the book. The only thing that this book has to offer is a little better understanding of the characters and the plot twists. The movie was really great, but when you read it, it's EXTREMELY STUPID."
5,Off the HOOK,Plain and simple: this album is OFF THE HOOK! Every song is well written and performed (And you should see them live! Whoa Baby!) Only problem is that these cuts need MORE AIR PLAY. What's with all the prayer-hatin?!?! Why these boys are not nominated for something really slammin is beyond reason.JW
5,Awsome CD,All i need to say is that this CD is one of the best i have ever bought and that BLINDSIDE is the best band from Sweden.....enough of this hives and vines BS..[they are not very good]If you enjoy good rock music silence will not disappoint..give it a try--best song - sleepwalking--
5,AWESOME CD!!,"This is probably one of the biggest upcoming christian bands, I see them getting way bigger then POD, I am a POD fan, but I have to say, I love Blindsides Music a lot better. I havn't personally met them yet, but I do know the Christian(Lead Singer) has an awesome pasion for God and these guys are really gona change some lives...GOD BLESS!matt"
5,This is SUCH a good CD,"This CD is so good i can't stop listening to it with the perfect melodys and sound blasting music i don't know how anyone can't like it, i like pod and always knew blindside was a good band i never knew they were this good, my favorite song on the pod cd features christian of blindside and i know now that i love this song because of him. Buy this CD it is well worth it!"
5,Works great,"Works as advertised. I have used this a lot in the past month and it works great every time. I have not had any problems with the product. It comes in very handy for me, because I don't have a lot of tools to make fancy joinery. I was able to make a nice blanket chest and a children's train table using this pocket hole jig.The only negative I had was with the super saver shipping offered by amazon. It took about 11 days for the product to arrive at my house. That seems a bit excessive."
5,Awesome,"i built a work table for my shop and the joints are SOLID, wishi had gotten this years ago for other projects that i have made."
4,prompt response,"The package was damaged and some pieces were broken. But when I called customer service, they were very courteous and replaced the broken pieces within 2 days."
2,Don't bother!,"I truly enjoy reading memoirs, but this one did not grab me at all. I couldn't wait until I was done, and regret wasting my time. There are numerous other books on this topic much more interesting!"
3,Like following a leader dog,"After playing Kingdom Hearts, I thought this would be a great follow-up. I was disappointed. KHII is pretty much a straight line game. You won't need a walkthrough for help--so if that is a bonus for you then go ahead. The graphics are beautiful, but I have come to expect more from Squaresoft."
5,5 star game and 6 star fun.,"THIS GAME IS AWESOME!!!I love it soooooooooooo much,if you need to know where different items are to make the ultima weapon,type it on google search and you will find the right one soon,I beat Sepheroth and got the ultima weapon and this game is fun,it never got old to me.The boss' were challenging and fun,the graphics were good,man,even the storyline was terrific.I played this game for months to try and get the ultima weapon and beat Sepheroth and once I hit level 90 I beat him.The keyblade that you get(fenrir) is greater at strength than any other keyblade,but enough about what I've done,they added more worlds more levels,more keyblades,more allies and more key characters.I sum it up in this statement ""I LOVE THIS GAME"""
2,Not impressive,"First, I was under the impression that this game must be great because it is highly rated. Then I found out that it is so over rated. I think the conversations in this games are so boring. The characters are so very not original. I don't like the idea of doing errands to make munny. So much like a real world. I am all for the surreal and over the top kinda games."
1,The sorriest Kiss video I have ever seen!!!!!!!!!!!!,"I bought the video the very same day it came out, fortunately for me, the place where I bought game me my money back when I took it back. Kiss can do a lot better then this!!!!! Kiss rules, (but not this time)."
4,Helpful Strategies For Content Area Reading,"I found this text to be very helpful in designing interesting and meaningful ways for students to enjoy content area reading and developing ways to help them gain better comprehension of the read material. It was organized in an easy to understand format but the authors consistent use of graphic organizers throughout the text did not seem to necessarily help in my understanding of the chapters. I did like, however, many of the techniques they mentioned, especially for vocabulary and writing. The reading roulette and different word puzzles and anticipation guides mentioned are good ideas that are easily incorporated into any lesson in any content area. This text, at the very least, provided a good basis for any teacher to design interesting activities to make reading in the content areas a little less intimidating and a lot more interesting."
1,PU REVIEW,NEVER RECEIVED THE PRODUCT. TRYED TO CONTACT MOWTOWN AND NUMEROUS TIMES AND THEY NEVER RESPONDED. I WILL NEVER BUY FROM THEM AGAIN AND ADVISE NO ONE ELSE TO BUY FROM THEM.
2,Disappointing,My favorite movie of all time is Somewhere in Time. This book put a whole new twist on the story & I really hated it. I would tell any true fan of Somewhere in Time to not read this!
2,Just soso.,"I loved the movie and thought that I would love the book. Books are always better that the movie right? Not in this case. It was really sappy. He repeated over and over and over the same single-minded 'stalker-ish' thoughts. I didn't really like it at all. The descriptions of place and time were enjoyable, but again he repeated the same phrases over and over. Very amateurish book. Sadly I was very disappointed."
4,"Memory Recalled, Going to order the Kindle version","Like many others, I have seen the movie several times, and although not a Romance kinda guy, I freely admit that I did indeed love the movie. I loved the music and every time that I hear ""The Rhapsody"", I recall the movie.I was reading the sample text and even that brought back another memory. My Destroyer was in the Long Beach Shipyard when the Queen was brought into the yards I think that this was in '68. What a sight, standing right before the Cutwater, bow, all that one could see is a vast expanse of black going down, up, left and right. At that time we had no idea as to what she was doing there, although there was some talk of a museum. I finally received my orders to Nuclear Power School, so I did not get to follow up on The Queen."
2,Flat and One-Sided Romance,"I saw the movie long ago, and frankly, I thought the movie was better. There is an old axiom that romance stories by women end in happily-ever-after and romances by men end in death, and that holds true in this case. I found the romance cloying, flat and one-sided. Suspension of disbelief is one thing, but a virtuous 1896 woman sleeping with a man she's known one day is another. I know this book is the precursor that laid the foundation for all the modern time travel love stories, but I still couldn't like it."
3,Interesting take on time travel,"Not bad. The first twenty or so pages were really slow. They were hard for me to get through since they were erratic and seemed to jump all over the place. I think that was the point since that's what Richard Collier was feeling at the time. As the story progresses and Richard travels back through time to 1896, the story drastically improves. The writing style is much more effortless and easy to follow. We get to know Richard Collier and get to see him court Elise McKenna, the Great American Actress. Nice little love story. I could have done without the last chapter (written by Robert, Richard's brother). It made the story seem false somehow and I would've preferred to be left in the world of Richard and Elise rather than outside it in Robert's world."
4,"Great product, lousy availability","Blizzard's action figures are of very good quality, but their availability is beyond rediculous. When $10 items like this start selling for over $100 used, there's clearly an issue with availabilty.With the popularity of the Warcraft series, Blizzard needs to act like a responsible manufacturer and balance the supply with the demand. This is a nice item for a Warcraft fan, but it's absurdly priced."
5,Great Movie,"I just want to say that this was a great movie. It reminded me of the others, ""Shall We Dance"", ""Step Up"", ""Save The Last Dance"", ""Stomping At The Savoy"" and the list could go on and on. Antonio was at his best as the dance instructor. The students were outstanding and also was Alfre Woodard. The little teacher who didn't want it to succeed, he was a character that they could have done without, but there is one in every bunch who wants everything new to fail. Just because they were not warming up to him and doing what he wanted them to do, he wanted it to fail. I am so glad that Antonio kept pushing them to succeed. Rob Brown stands out in any movie he is in. Good Actor. Like I said, ""Great Movie""."
1,?,I would be able to review it better if i wud have received my item! when my order was placed on oct 3rd and still not received.
3,buyer be-ware,"If your looking for the newer version of the doodlebops this isn't it. The packaging is deceiving, the package has the newer doodlebops where all 3 videos are the first episodes with the bad costumes and bad make-up. Mattered to me because the deceptive packaging, but my 3 year old doesn't care, she loves them anyway."
4,"Good price, delivered promptly",I ordered and received a Lumix branded battery promptly. The price was great and so far it seems to hold charge like a new battery should.
1,Total Waste of Money,"After six consecutive days of trying to obtain an accurate temperature reading with this ""precision instrument"" I junked it for a medium to high end digital. $25.00 lesson learned."
5,For a 4-year-old,"It was my son's birthday present. It is very light and sleek. At first sight I thought it would be too fast for him, but it was just perfect! Even though he is just 4, the handle is short and we had to lift a little. I can see him using it for years to come!"
4,Help!,"This was purchased as a Christmas gift for a four year old girl. Because of our New York winter, she wasn't able to use it until recently.She loves to ride. The scooter is lightweight, easy to handle and would be perfect if we could get it to fold flat as designed. But it will not fold flat. Her mom and dad have tried numerous times but the mechanism simply refuses to cooperate. Any suggestions? We are giving the scooter a rating of 4 because of this problem.Anna Russo"
3,Get the cruizer,"I race scoots. Instead of this one, Get the Cruiser with bigger 140mm wheels (2x price). Get precision bearings - much faster/easier($30 more). This thing (standard)is a toy for kids, but still works for the ""standard class"" racing (they do check the bearings for stamp)."
2,Ok,It is a ok scooter but at the same time it is bad.the forks bend easy the breaks fall of and get rusty.the grip tape is the worst part of. The scooter I would not get it
5,Just what I needed,Perfect for my 5 and 7 year old daughters. Fun and nice that it can fold. Shipping was fast. I recommend this scooter to any 4+ years old.
3,back wheels broke,rides and controls well. Compact storage when folded.but my back wheel burst apart after about a month of use. now I have to fork over 10 dollars to buy a new set.
5,Loves it!,My 6 year old grandson got this for Christmas from Santa. He is very capable of riding this and is having a blast with it!
4,Good fun!,"I purchased this scooter for my Grandson's 5th birthday thinking ""he'll grow into it"" but he hopped on it right away and loved it. All the children in his cul-de-sac had them so he joined in and had a great time riding with the big kids. Even his 30 year old Uncle had a go on it and thought it was great fun!!! Easily snapped together and so far no complaints about it."
5,My kids love it!,I bought 4 of these for my kids and they all love them. They haven't gotten bored of them yet after several months. They are built pretty well and have taken lots of abuse so far. I also like how they fold so we can store them easily.
4,Great Scooter.,"My boys (5 and 7) both love this scooter. I got one for each of them. The only thing I would recommend is tightening the handle bar after you raise it up. It seems tight out of the package, but it easily loosens. The directions recommend this, but I forgot to do it so my son's adjustment bolt and quick-release came off after he rode it for a little while. Great buy!"
4,useful for my college llife,This is a really light scooter and very easy to fold to carry. It saves me a lot of time to go to different classrooms and I can just fold it and put it under my chair during the class which is super convenient!
4,Razor A2,"Scooter was exactly what we wanted for our 5 year old daughter who has been riding her big brother's very old Razor for the last few months. Small problem: one of the handles did not fit into the cylinder. Of course we did not try to put it together until Christmas Eve and were stuck with it so my husband hammered it in . . . it can never be taken apart, but the scooter works just fine. It's purple and that is really all she cares about. We purchased her brother's Razor about 10 years ago and it still works great, so we think Razors are good products."
3,Good For A Scooter,This is a good scooter but scooters in general aren't great. It has low ground clearage but that's not so important.It gos pretty fast and the brakes are great. The only thing is Iwouldn't recomend it for older kids 'cause the handlebars don't go that high.
5,Loves it!,"I got this for my 5 year old son for his birthday. He loves it! He has become very good at stopping and turning with both feet up, which makes him feel like he is so big."
3,The Pros and Cons of a Razor Scooter,"I was looking for something cute and fun that'll get me around town and I figured a scooter would be perfect. I've read some customer reviews and I can't agree more with them. It certainly is a lot of fun, but the durability of this thing isn't that great. My handle bars are twisted which results in a wheel not pointing in the right direction and for some reason mine won't seem to fold. It could just be me though. Maybe I just got a rotten scooter :-/Assuming you get one that works...you'll probably really enjoy it :]]"
5,My 7 year old loves it,"My 7 year old loves this scooter. it was a Christmas present and she was thoroughly excited when she saw it. It is a quality built scooter and seems like it will last her a while. My only complaint is that it is hard to store. We keep it inside the house and there is no way to lean it up against a wall because it will roll down and fall in the floor. Even when its folded its hard to put it in a corner for storage.Overall a sturdy, high quality scooter for a great price of $19.99! In stores it typically ran about $29 so its a great deal."
5,scooter,I purchased this scooter for my 7 year old son and he absolutely loves it. He's happy therefore I'm happy too.
4,Kids love it,My son loves this scooter. My only complaint is that he has been on it 4 or 5 times and there is already a loud sound coming from the back wheel so I'm not sure ho long it is made to last.
5,BOUGHT FOR MY 4 YEAR OLD SON,"I bought this for my son's 4th birthday, I was skeptical at first since the recommended age for this product is 5 & up, but my son has mastered riding his bike already & is well coordinated. He wanted a ""big boy"" scooter too so...I really like that the height is adjustable, my son is 40 inches, it came preassembled & folds nicely for storage. Very durable. A helmet, knee & elbow pads are a must! He fell a few times at first testing it out but with some instruction he is more confident in riding it. Great scooter for the price, I dont regret the purchase at all!"
4,Ok,"Easy to set up - this is the second one I am buying. No explanation on the site as to why certain colors cost more, so I simply chose the cheaper colors (blue and green) though they were for girls, and they wanted pink/ red. Didn't read instructions for first one, so some screws fell off, but with the second one, I did, and all is well - it works great. It's adjustable so can be used for kids of varying heights. But for taller than avg kids, might not work (my older is 7 yrs, and nearly 5 feet - so it's kinda short for her)Good product, overall"
5,great insight and information for parents and students,"The Gap Year Advantage is the most comprehensive and useful book about the benefits and realities of the Gap Year experience. As the parent of a student who did a gap year, we would have better prepared having read this book. Can't recommend it more highly."
5,Great switch,"This switch is awesome, easy to install, directions weren't the best, but very easy. I would recommend to anyone who wants to use their portable generator safely."
5,Does an outstanding job!,"Installed this last year after Hurricane Irene after purchasing a portable generator. Just had a chance to test it during a 6 day power outage with Hurricane Sandy. It worked like a charm. Have it wired to Kitchen circuit to cover refrigerator, Furnace, Sump pump and the rest various lighting circuits throughout house to get by.If you have a portable generator, this is the only way to go. Many of my neighbors were running units with extension cords, but its not ideal. I had heat !"
4,Marcia Hines and The Damned,"Errr... yeah, she's in The Damned.. not many people knew about it.. that covershot made me laugh out loud when I saw it"
3,good,"The book was what I needed but I later had to find more information to complete my work. Overall the book was fine. The service, well it took forever to get here, but okay."
5,Great for me,Love the Neuvaderm cream from Skin Origins. Recommended to me by my dermatologist for my sensitive skin condition. Skin Origins products seem to be perfect for me. Neuvaderm cream went on nice and smooth and dried fast. Skin felt very moist and elastic afterwards. I love this since I no longer have to worry about break-outs!
3,it's ok..,Good moistureizer...that's about it. No evidence of any anti-aging properties as advertised. I plan to stick with Oil of Olay.
2,The bottle was really annoying. It only pumps a tiny bit of cream each time I tried to use it & I didn't notice a difference,I would not recommend this product for the price and the result. I'm actually tempted to return the lotion and get my money back because the pump was so ineffective at actually getting the cream out of the bottle!
1,Garbage,"I bought this manga a while back and I hated it. It is rated Teen but should be rated older teen or M. It has foul language, risque outfits and some discrimination (referring to the scene where in the background it refers to a Cuban in a vulgar manner).The story is not developed and poorly written. The art is okay, but not unique.Dont even waste your money on this, it is complete and utter GARBAGE."
4,Fastway - 'Say What You Will: Live' (Receiver Records) 4 1/2 stars,"I never even knew that Fastway had a legit live release out. This thing kicks ass! I've got two bootleg CD's from their first two lp's / tours in 1983-84, but this 'Say What You Will Live' is from their third 'actual' lp 'The World Waits For You' road trek in 1986. Features three power-packed tunes from the album, including the title track ""The World..."", ""Waiting For The Roar"" and ""Kill Me With Your Heart"". Of course other Fastway goods are present, such as ""Feel Me,Touch Me"", the rousing ""Steal The Show"" and their first exposure to stardom ""Say What You Will"". Vocalist Dave King (thank goodness) is still with 'em on this disc. This title may be hard to find unless you're willing to spend a lot. Great '80's British metal to relive again. Fastway fans, rejoice!"
5,As Far As My Feet Will Carry Me,"This is a German movie with English subtitles, but dont let that stop you. Based on a true story about a German held prisoner in a Russian labor camp somewhere in Siberia. His escape and the long journey home to the family he was forced to leave behind. I do not speak German & am not into subtitles, but this one really struck an accord with me. I rented it at a video place & enjoyed it so much that I not only purchased the DVD for my extensive DVD library, but have also ordered the book. Take a chance....watch this movie as it will stay with you awhile, not be forgotten like a lot of other movies you watched."
1,Honor Bound audio,I'm still waiting on this item ordered last month. What more can I say on something that hasn't been delivered? It wa supposed to be available December 27th.
4,New York Dolls - 'Seven Day Weekend' (Trojan),"Nineteen track release of previously unheard demos + several New York Dolls tunes that I just plain don't recognize - the title cut ""Seven Day Weekend"", ""Who Are The Mystery Girls?"" and the K. Lewis penned ""Bad Detective"" along with more of the usual ""Trash"", ""Human Being"", ""Babylon"" among others. Sound quality is pretty good. All and all, a great compilation."
1,Beyond bad!,"The conclusion to Azrael's run in the Batman costume was such an amazing let down. I can't imagine how fans felt when this was coming out but it was such a strange path to get Bruce back in the Batman costume. A strange tangent involving random ninjas was the biggest offense but if add that to terrible dialogue by Robin and Nightwing you have a dreadful book. Also there is a change in attitude towards Azrael by Bruce that doesn't fit with his character at all. The art was good in places terrible in others. Overall, this is book that is better left to the recesses of our memories."
1,Kneedeep in Bull,"I've always been a fan of Brett Butler's show and frankly like just about any biography, even if I'm not a fan of the individual. Am I the only one who noticed Brett's attempt at sounding ""smart"" and using unnecessary long words in odd places? I would love to read the ""real"" story without all the long, pretentious words that just made this book irritating to read."
5,go nuts!,excellent selection of nuts in a nice package size (2oz). very handy to take along for a snack between meals.very tasty.
5,A MUST HAVE for any avid TITANIC researcher,"I purchased this marvellous book on the 88th aniversary of the sinking of Titanic. I am about half way into the book and can honestly say that I can't put it down. This book is a must have for any Titanic buff (like me). This book not only comes with a gripping tale of the authors quest for the Titanic, but it also is illustrated with marvellous pictures, and colour pictures and diagrams by the world renowned Titanic artist Ken Marshall. I can honestly say that this book is one of my favourites out of my Titanic collection."
1,never got item,I ordered this and got safety pins instead. They gladly refunded my money but I would like to have to product I ordered.
5,Great Read From LLMiller,I loved this book combo from Linda Lael Miller. Lots of interesting backstory and very well developed characters. I had never enjoyed old westerns but Linda brings the old west and the people to life. Great author and another great book
4,What's the Role of the Social Critic?,"Walzer uses the examples of eleven important left-wing social critics to discuss the role of the social critic and social criticism. He is much concerned with the question of to what extent the critic should be detached from the society he criticizes. Walzer's views are interesting by themselves, but the book is also a good way to learn about writers such as Julien Benda and Herbert Marcuse."
1,"Disappointing, poorly written","Being from Las Vegas, I enjoy reading autobiographical and historical stories about Nevada lifestyles. I enjoyed ""Beyond the Neon"", which I felt gave an interesting perspective on what it's like to work on the front lines of the hotel/casino. So I was disappointed when this book, which I waited several weeks to get from the Library Kindle program, was little more than a Penthouse letter -- it's thinly-veiled porn, poorly written. The anecdotes weren't interesting, salacious rather than sympathetic. I am not adverse to good x-rated entertainment, and certainly approached the subject with an open mind, but did not get anything interesting informative from this book. Nah, waste of time."
3,"NOT vintage, but pretty cool anyway.","Despite the confusing and misleading name of this new group, Scott himself is NOT present. Of course not - Raymond Scott was born in 1908 and died many years ago. And DON'T think this band is preserving the ORIGINAL Raymond Scott sound (like the Sun Ra or Glenn Miller bands that still tour). Instead, this ""Orchestrette"" (sic) performs modernized and altered arrangements that Raymond Scott probably would have hated. (Scott didn't like improvisation - especially when applied to HIS music.) But maybe some hard-core fans might dig these new takes on the old Scott classics? The players are impressive enough; they're not afraid to take chances, and I bet this group is fun to see in a live venue. But since there's plenty of original Raymond Scott recordings, I'd suggest a beginner start with the real thang, baby."
1,Never Received it.,I never recieved the product bc they said they don't ship over seas. I brought it from Target instead.
5,Only buy this if you have time to dedicate to it - it is so good you won't want to do anything else.,"I bought this for my sister for Christmas. I had never seen a single episode, but she said it was good so I bought the first season to see what it was all about. It was so good that I watched the entire season back to back. I borrowed seasons 2 & 3 from her, and watched THOSE back to back. I already have season 4 reserved on NetFlix and it hasn't even been released yet. This ties with Dexter as my favorite tv series."
5,Jaw Dropping.,"I got this season for my birthday last month. I literally watched it in 3 days. The story lines were amazing, the twists were ridiculous and the finale left me sweating. I sat on my couch with my mouth open and almost crapping my pants. This season was by far the best season of the three I've seen, and I can't stop recommending it to everyone I talk to. It's very, very, very worth watching and I would give it 6 stars if I could!"
3,VERY Weak Season,"After 2 spectacular opening seasons the third was incredibly disappointing. While it contained many of the usual Nip/Tuck antics, it was way too focused on The Carver from the end of Season 2. Still worth watching if you're into the series, just don't think it will be as great as 1 or 2."
1,Really not good,"Season 3 of Nip/Tuck's claim to fame is that the writers apparently made the adventurous decision to turn over the plot development and writing to Harvard's sophomore ""creative writing"" class, or to Saturday Night Live's writers. (Who can tell the difference anyway?)The Carver plot line is just too stupid for words, the writing ham-fisted, the acting posed and cliche. The goodwill earned in the first season -- already stretched to the limits by the ludicrous time distortions inherent in the depicted healing processes -- evaporates by the third overlong limey monolog by the chick from Boston Legal. By the end, the characters are so pompous and wooden, the plotlines so hoakey and patheticc that you'll be saying ""never again"" as you chuck the boxed DVD set into your Amvets donation box."
3,Still one of the better shows on TV but...,The characters really got lost in all the hype of the whole Carver storyline. They milked the whodun it for all it was worth until it reached an unsatisfying and predictable conclusion. I think Entertainment Weekly got it right in saying it was if the writers were writing the season on their computer with one finger and flipping us off with the other.
2,MMM,"The idea of this toy is super cute, but the suction cups don't work very well and as with all squirt toys it gets moldy on the inside. The kids play with it I would say about 30% of the time."
1,This is just bad noise,"Not only is it bad noise, but it's an insult of the highest order to call it ""Progressive"". Progressive what? Noise? Devin made a fool of himself on Steve Vai's Sex and Religion (although he, by far, was not the only thing wrong there), and he continues to sound awful on these solo efforts...except now, he's the only one to blame.We're choosing to put him in the same category with the likes of Pain of Salvation, Symphony X, Threshold, and Vanden Plas? Why? Because his albums are distributed by the same record label as those other artists? Sorry...that doesn't count. It never ceases to amaze how some people manage to gain respect, even though they've done nothing to deserve it.C'mon people...this isn't good. Buy something else."
2,Not one of Oke's best.,"""Julia's Last Hope"" is a typical Janette Oke book, but I felt that it fell short of her other books. I always turn to Oke's books when I need a book to read quickly, and this is the case with this one. While it's light and easy to read, I didn't feel it provoke any emotions within me, like her stories usually do. I thought the plot to be rather redundant, and I was waiting for something to happen - and nothing ever did. I do not recommend."
1,NO GOOD. BACK AWAY FROM THIS ONE.,This video is inappropriate for young children to watch because it has subject material that encourages crinimal behavior. Please do what is right and buy a different dvd.
3,ok Planet of the Apes book,"I think Eric Greene did a good jop on writing this book.Though it does not cover any behind the scenes imformation.Its main focus is the political themes of the apes series.It tells about how the movies,TV shows,and more are related about probems(like Veitnam)in the 60s and 70s.Its a good book over all."
5,Wonderfull!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!,This game worked perfect on my GBASP. I Hope you like it!!!
1,Mounting nuts !!!!,"Why, why, why... toilet seats are as old as civilized mankind. Why thus inventing a bold/nut system that just not hold the seat in place. What is up with this black plastic nut which you need to press with all might for the bolt to grep on. It's takes little to dislodge the nut and thus the whole seat to come lose.Wonder if anybody actually quality tested and consumer tested this ""new"" solution..."
2,for a bit of British light-heartedness try this flick,"A light-hearted comedy about a pair of English aristocrats forced to rent out their estate to an American band and pose as their servants. This is a vehicle solely for the enhancement of Peter O'Toole and no one else. Alicia Silverstone is completely underused, with her supporting role barely a bit more than a cameo; it could've been anyone else in that role and the movie would've still been the same. This movie is okay to watch on a rainy afternoon, while you are channel surfing."
3,Guaranteed to raise a smile.,"Take a sweet (if somewhat predictable) plot; add great actors and a beautiful set; stir in some rockin' sounds; sprinkle librally with broad comedy, drugs and the F word; and you have this thoroughly enjoyable late-night movie. It's not exactly X-rated, but it's not for those who are easily offended by ""language."" Perfect for old hippies and all broad-minded folks who enjoy seeing people go from bad to good."
2,"Good music, not good recording","Rhonda has a good band and some great material, but she is being let down by her own Adventures studio, her husband, producer -Darrin Vincent was giving a talk about production and he did not mention analog, a lot of bluegrass musicians still use 2 inch tape to record on because it iso warm. Also, there are great digital recordings that I have heard that have been mastered in the analog domain. If you know music, compare Rhonda's ""One Step Ahead"" and this. Lots of distortion and distractions on this poor recording, yet great songs. Never heard an Allison Kraus CD sound bad."
5,Squenix brings us Old School RPG Perfection!,"Have you ever played a game where you tought : ""Ah, they should have added this!"" or ""This is painfull they why did they put this in?"" ? Well Dragon Quest VIII is the exact opposite of those games. Everything in this game is perfect... really... They've refined the old-school RPG to create this perfect universe that will keep you hooked for a 100 if not more!!!From game pacing to depth to animation to graphics... it's truly a master piece. Akira Toriyama's character design brings back all my love for Dragon Ball and makes this games an instant crush. The Hero even borrows some character traits from Goku.Overall if you love RPG this is a game to own, no doubt! If you've never been into RPGs then run away from this title. If you were on the borderline of trying one, the learning curve might be steep because you'll be into deep RPG ground but you'll never regret investing your time and money in there!"
3,"Hawkwind - 'Acid Daze,Vol.3' (Receiver Records)","Pretty much like 'Acid Daze,Vol.1' and 'Acid Daze,Vol.2' discs,the trilogy ends here.Another CD compilation with cutting floor material(as some might call it).Has three pre-Hawkwind blues cuts by a solo(?)Dave Brock when he was apparently playing as a street musician,""Dealing With The Devil"",""Bring It On Home"" and Came Home"",plus some vintage Hawkwind gems like ""Space Is Deep"",""You Shouldn't Do That"" and ""Silver Machine"".Obviously aimed toward the completist."
5,2 for the price of one,These are great movies from my childhood. THey should be apart of any collection. All children will love the magic and songs.
2,Absolutely unbearable.,"Absolutely unbearable. I think I gave it about 80 pages of very small type. Another one of these ""weird"" books that is trying to be clever. It is possible that there is a palatable story in here somewhere, but I really didn't care enough to find out."
2,Literary noodling for people snowed in for the month,"Foucault's Pendulum is a long and ponderous expensive book about a publisher of long and ponderous expensive books. My ex-husband and I read it aloud to each other when it first came out, thinking it might be a painless way to soak up some background information on secret societies. But Holy Blood, Holy Grail, a popular non-fiction book on the same theme, was much more readable.As for the byzantine plot and characterization.... Fifteen years later, all I can remember is the opening scene, where we learn that a writer has disappeared, leaving behind his personal computer, and our protagonist is trying to guess the password.This book appears to be an elaborate conceptual joke aimed at people who have w-a-y too much time on their hands and want to transcend the need for entertainment."
1,Foucault's P,"This book holds much promise to the reader: a good mystery, lots of arcane knowledge, recognizable real-life cults. Unfortunately,it's the sort of book only professional critics love. I found it interesting in idea, but cumbersome to read. It has moments of brilliance,but all too often resorts to long lists of names which the reader, presumedly, is supposed to recognize. To my mind, a novel shouldnot be this much work to read."
1,Literally the worst book I've ever read...,"I finished this book with great effort only because it kills me not to complete a book. Every aspect of this book is horrible. Eco drones on way too long in minute details that seem to be there only because they were in his research notes. There are pages of unreadable material, paragraphs they consist of lists of useless items. The characters are 1 dimensional at best and the plot, as it finally unfolds it unremarkable and ridiculous.Imagine a very brainy history or philosophy professor pouring out whatever popped into his head for hundreds of pages and then a publisher putting it out verbatim without bothering to have an editor take a look at it. If they had done that to this book it would have been a semi-interesting, but unentralling short story.Run away from this book.If it's a status symbol to be reading this book, or more impossibly to complete it, then I want nothing to do with the peer group that finds such a tortuous endeavor admirable."
3,Where is an editor when you need one?,"This is a book that I'm glad I read, but only in the sense of climbing a daunting mountain. The accomplishment is worthwhile in itself, but the view from the summit isn't inspiring enough to justify the trip. For me, Belbo's Partisan boyhood and elemental yearnings were the real story. The Frankenstein-ish Plan revealed how he created and destoyed his own worlds, but the tortuous path robbed the revelation of much of its joy. Perhaps we can blame the translator.???"
3,"Auido Version: Great book, great reader, but abridged . . .","I really enjoyed this book. Not only is Eco a master of language and story-telling, he is a master of suspense as well. I spent the entire time I listened to this book on the edge of my proverbial seat.Tim Curry, the actor from Clue, does an amazing job reading the book. Bot only does he handle the different languages, but he conveys the mood and tempo of the book while remaining intelligible.In the end, however, I spent much of the book wondering what I was missing. I dislike abridged works for that feeling. In this version's favor, the story line maintained its cohesiveness, as far as I could tell, unlike most of the other abridgemens I have read."
4,Foucault's Pendulum,"This book is a notoriously difficult read. Having the dictionary integrated into the Kindle made it less ponderous, and let me enjoy the book much much more. My dad used to tell me: ""Look it up, and you'll always remember it."" He wasn't talking to me in my 60's and ""always"" turns out to be longer than my memory these days. Second time around is a much more fun read of this one for me."
3,Where is ***?,"This book is challenging to read as well as to absorb. In many ways it is a novel version of Frazer's ""Golden Bough,"" utilizing a dizzying array of scientific, mythological, historical, theological, and hallucinatory references. Maybe Eco was trying to construct a literary mandala. Unfortunately, the characters were a little too detached and a sense of reality and believability was never really achieved for me. The book's 120 chapters read more like disparate essays than a cohesive thread. Perhaps we are beckoned to uncover Eco's hidden code in the text, but I, like Casaubon, am ready for something simply beautiful."
1,A pompous and inflated masturbatory exercise,"After reading and enjoying the Name of the Rose, I figured Eco's follow-up would be comparable. However, I found this book a big waste of my time. It is easily the most self-indulging book I've read. To those who would insinuate you need a vast education to appreciate the work, I would beg to differ. I am myself not exactly a stranger to issues of epistemology and pseudoscientific diatribes, and still I found this book PAINFUL to read! And I did read it all, BTW.It's egregiously abysmal!"
2,Could have been far better,"The plot of this book is quite compelling, and looking back it really is a book that leaves you with the impression of being intellectually substantial.The problem is that it is cripled by the authors preference for including all sorts of irrelevant details, and to be honest, at times it reads like he is just rambling on.But if that doesn't bother you, then go ahead an read it. Otherwise, read some authors who understand the beauty and power of simplicity (e.g. Hemmingway, Kawabata, Blixen), because Eco, if he does, is not displaying it in this book."
2,Sucker Punch of a Book,"I read this ages ago but just came across it again and was deluged by negative memories of the the book. I found part of the history and the story to be truly engaging. That engagement helps the reader get through much of the filler, which is a slog to read through. But the hope is that all of that work will lead to a well-deserved conclusion. Not so here.... if you decide to read this ridiculous tome, do so without expectations that the resolution at the end will lead to any significant insight."
2,Why all the hype?,"I can't for the life of me, see why people get so starry-eyed about this book. It started out interesting but then degenerated into a meandering morass of pretentious prose. After 240 pages, I completely lost interest. I gave it two stars because the guy clearly can write; it just doesn't seem like he has much to actually say. I realize that I'm supposed to think this is brilliant but this seems like little more than pseudo-intellectual masturbation...Yawn.Not recommended."
4,Great Novel,"This is a marvelously playful conspiracy novel that ties together a multitude of disparate antagonists and occult systems, including the Knights Templar and Kabbalistic ideas. Not quite a classic novel for its genre - IMHO it needed some more comedic elements."
1,A cure for insomnia,"This boring, over-long waste of paper is either Eco having a big joke, or he was drunk. I was unable to finish it. I only reached page 55, but by then there should have been the beginnings of an interesting plot, and the development of some interesting characters. This mish-mash has neither, and nothing in those first few dozen pages indicates that it ever will. This is the written equivalent of modern art--ugly, pretentious, meaningless, over-hyped, fawned-over by shallow sophisticates."
2,Too Much Detail,"There is too much packed into this book for my taste. I worked to keep track of the thread of this mystery through esoteric detail of physics, religion, history and legend but in the end, I found that it took too long for me to discover what pertinence all this information was going to have to the tale. In fact, too many facts. Sad, because I love all of this type of background to a good mystery, but there was something self-indulgent about the amount of time spent dwelling on every little thing. Of course, as we all know, my opinion is unimportant considering the terrific success the book celebrated. Still, its successor in form, The DaVinci Code while packed with minutia, was much more user-friendly."
4,solid basic writing text,"I use this book to teach a beginning writing class. The variety of essays is quite good; not every one is a winner, but probably 60% are accessible and there are some rarities here that the students have thoroughly enjoyed, including ""Dumpster Diving"" by Lars Eighner and ""A Crime of Compassion"" by Barbara Huttmann. There are enough writers the likes of Dillard, MLK, Ackerman, and Orwell to acquaint novices with great writing, balanced with a good variety of more pop-oriented magazine style pieces. The strategies and guidelines for essays are excellent, and a wealth of possible topics for further development is offered throughout. My class prep time is easy and concise thanks to the book's structure and execution."
4,"Very good, entertaining book!",I really enjoyed it! I read this book about 6 years ago and still remember it fondly.
2,Time better spent on a better book,"I must concur with the majority of reviewers. The book has an interesting premise, but enormous logical flaws, and often characters behaving in ways that seem ""out of character""."
3,A good selection of Ska,"Firstly, be aware that these songs are all live performances (which is not mentioned anywhere) and as such the sound quality is probably less than it should be to make it worth putting out on DVD-A.Other than that there is a good selection of songs with some lesser known numbers mixed in among the radio hits.It is probably not worth paying the premium for DVD-A if you can find these songs on a CD."
1,obfuscation,"How interesting to find a book about the religion I grew up in, written by someone in the group. This would never have been allowed in the early days of this sect. But a lot of things have changed in this religion since 1897. Writing a novel to obfuscate the beginnings doesn't change the truth. Which begs the question: Why hide the origin? That is only the first question.For someone looking to find books with answers about this religion, a better choice might be The Secret Sect or Church Without a Name."
5,Easy to use and lots of examples!,Bought this for school - it's perfect. It explains things in simple language - easy to understand. And there are lots of examples. Love this book!
4,pretty damn good,"this band is really heavy and has disgusting lyrics. lol, can't get any better than this. the only reason i gave it 4 stars is cause it got a little repetative but other than that it is a good cd."
5,BRUTAL $HIT!!!,"This album is totally brutal! I agree with the other 5-star reviews & also recommend it to any death metal fan. I heard the 2nd one, ""Humanure,"" 1st, but I think this one is just as good. Get either one of them."
1,Chimes in a gale force wind.,I have five of these as my home is my cabin away from my real cabin. These Brass chimes are well built and look very nice however it really takes a good wind to make them chime.
4,Foxtrot - En Masse,Bought this for my 11 year old grandson but also have this in my collection of light books. Very entertaining look at everyday life with a family of 5. The interaction between the family members is very funny and relatable
3,Well researched but no surprises here.,"Maraniss does a creditible job of researching his subject. I found the account to be well- balanced and fair. The book carefully and methodically lays down incident after incident in Bill Clinton's life which point to a pattern of behavior that goes back to at least his late teens and which would lead one to believe that the recent troubles he is experiencing, the result of hubris, were all but unavoidable. I enjoyed the book although it was written prior to the recent scandals."
4,"More than just ""Slack""","""Slack"" of course, was the blazing single about workplace resentment that put Superchunk on the map. But this collection is bursting with worthy stuff.One standout is the defiant ""My Noise,"" wherein Mac declares that, even if what he's playing is stupid, he loves it and he is driven to play it for anyone who will listen. He also bristles with confidence on ""Cool,"" written in the spirit of the old saw about how good composers borrow and great composers steal. ""What Do I"" leads the album off nicely, and ""The Breadman"" is punchy.You'll probably enjoy the version of ""Cast Iron"" that appears on No Pocky For Kitty; the production is a little fuller. But this album's ""Seed Toss"" and the No Pocky For Kitty version are equally good."
2,Not very useful!,"This book really isn't very useful, especially for anyone living outside the southwestern desert. Mr. Olsen wrote the outdoor survival merit badge requirements for the boy scouts, and this is indicative of how the book reads. Most of the information is nice to know and even interesting at times, but it gets silly at points and is more historical in nature than anything. This book might be a good read for those interested in how people survived off the land in the distant past, but offers nothing in terms of modern survival skills. I believe that anyone interested in actually surviving in the wilderness would be better off looking elsewhere. I was disappointed."
4,"Fun and varied, but lacking in educational quality","The 75 projects in this lab are interesting and many customers will enjoy putting them together. It is a worthwhile item for use as a toy, but don't expect a novice to gain any relatively deep understanding of circuitry.The projects are delivered in ""cookbook"" fashion, i.e. this-connects-to-that-connects-to-the-other. Reasons for why a circuit should be set up this way are minimal. Sometimes it will say something like ""the transistor and capacitor provide the signal, while the other capacitor and resistor control the frequency."" Why we should use one capacitor over another is not addressed.The manual also attempts to teach the reader how to read the schematics, but this instruction is also lacking.Overall, though, this is an enjoyable kit, and worth the price in terms of how much there is to do. Someone looking for something more educational, though, might look elsewhere."
2,my true confession,"Saw this movie when it came out in the theaters ever so long ago, and haven't seen it since until this week. Having watched it, I am left scratching my head wondering what I found so appealing in this movie 30 years ago. I have no problems with the powerhouse acting of the two leads or for that matter the other characters as well. Excellent performances. Beyond that, the story seems slow and at times disjointed. I rewound several times to make sense of what was going on. I appreciate the many comments of reviewers here who have helped fill in my gaps of understanding. That being said, other reviewers who gave it more stars affirm that it's a movie more about character study than about story."
3,Redesigned,"I have owned three sets of these speakers. The first had stunning sound quality for the price. I replaced it with a white set which had equal sound but started to hiss after a couple of months. The reseller replaced it, but my third set is a completely different product. The speaker elements are different from the previous ones and from what is shown on the box. The sound quality is not the same. The real problem is the subwoofer. The lower bass is weak and muddy. The satellites have become more directional and their placement is now critical for sound quality. It's very difficult to get good sound over a larger area. Trebles dominate and have to be turned down to let middles come through. This is a redesign inteded to ruin a brand name.If you want a set for your desktop, check out Harman-Kardon Soundsticks II. It has more balanced sound with a tighter subwoofer."
4,Great dance cd!,This is a very fun dance cd! Although the lyrics are not in english its still fun to listen to. Great for if you are trying to get the beat of Zumba or just to play in the background while working out or cleaning.
5,Comfortable,Helmet is comfortable and I hope I never learn if it will protect my head. It also allows lots of airflow so you won't get too hot.
5,I cracked this helmet in a crash and have only scratches to show for it.,"I was riding my bike on the mountain bike course and one of the obstacles, which was damaged previously, was not taken out of service. Long story short, I fell a ways and bruised and scratched up the entire left side of my body. My helmet is totaled, but the worst to my head is a slight headache. I'm buying another one today. I don't care about the stupid visor issue, this helmet works and I'm writing this today because it did."
5,Great Helmet/Physics 101,"Unlike another review I read on here this is the helmet in the picture to a t. It does feel cheap and look a little crappy but that is the secret of it's design. The helmet is made to break apart and expend the energy of impact so that your skull doesn't. Let's face it, helmets are not cool, nor are they cool looking, and odds are you will feel and look like a doofus wearing one but, I'd rather look stupid than have my skull smashed and be stupid. A great helmet, I'd rather wear and not need than need and not be wearing. I hope I never have to test it."
1,Piece of junk.,"I ordered this helmet online. When it showed up, many of the plastic surface panels were detaching from the helmet. The glue they use is garbage. It did fit alright however. Nevertheless I returned it due to the defective glue."
3,"Inexpensive Helmet, a little shoddy.","This helmet looks nice with the faux carbon fiber shell and it fits alright with the adjustable headband. You get lots of airflow and I believe it would nicely protect ones head in a fall. However, you somewhat get what you pay for in this very inexpensive helmet. The shell and side parts come unglued almost immediately. Really, be prepared to glue them back on. Its not a deal killer and if you have some super glue handy once you re-glue it you should be fine. Its an easy fix but still a dissapointment to have to make the repair in the first place. This is apparently very common for this helmet. It does not effect the helmets ability to protect you in a fall. Its just a nuisance."
2,Fell apart within a week,"I guess the foam is what matters so I left a star on there for kicks since it was still ""safe"" but this product is terrible. I ordered this helmet to save some money. I got what I paid for. The plastic designs pasted on top of the foam peeled off within a week of being in air conditioning and having had no use. I am hesitant to argue its safety because I have yet to risk it but I wouldn't trust the workmanship. I wouldn't recommend this product at all. It looked great out of the package but that's where the positives end."
2,Shabby workmanship,"The item showed up and two pieces fell offas I was removing it from the plastic bag.The product seems otherwise fine, but Ishould not have to glue a new productback together."
3,Doesn't seem very substantial,"I bought this because it's inexpensive, and I got what I paid for. The plastic feels brittle and seems like it would snap without much stress. I don't think I would trust it for serious biking or in high traffic areas, but it might be okay for a mild biker on a park trail?If you are going to ride your bike on the street, high traffic, or rough terrain, I would recommend spending a little extra to get a helmet that is more substantial."
3,It's a helmet,"I was looking for a cheap helmet to complete a triathlon. Fits well, doesn't look bad and it was cheap."
2,Cheap,"Make no mistake, this is a cheap helmet.It doesn't appear to be one in the photos, or from a distance, but it's definitely cheap. The ""shell"" on the outside is very thin and just cheaply glued on, it appears to be more like a hard cardstock coated in clear plastic than an actual shell.The padding on the inside of the helmet is almost non-existent. It does little to prevent the helmet from scooting around on your head a bit.Aesthetically, this helmet appears to be quite large in comparison to other helmets. I even overheard a kid say ""What's that huge thing on that guy's head?""Ventilation is also not very good.All in all, it's a helmet and I'm sure it would protect your head in a crash, but with offerings by Giro and others available at only a few dollars more on Amazon, there's no reason to choose the el cheapo schwinn.Wish I could have the money back..."
3,Helmet,"The helmet works fine. Better price than the local discount stores. The chin strap seems to be too far forward. I have been trying to adjust it back, but it is not very user friendly."
1,Schwinn Thrasher Bike Helmet,This fell apart in less than one week. The outer plastic shell came off without any misuse at all. It just fell off even though there were no falls with it and the helmet was not mistreated. What a waste of money!
1,Falling apart upon arrival,"This helmet had pieces falling off of it immediately upon opening it. All of the plastic coverings were loose, and I suspect they would fall off with minimal use. Do not buy this product. It is faulty. Other reviewers have had the same problem."
2,Visor won't Last.,"The Visor won't stay on. The helmet was great for about one week then the visor started falling off. I would not recommend as this should not of happened. I gave this a 2 star, as the rest of the helmet is still good but now has four holes were the visor should be."
1,Simply too small,"I bought this Schwinn Trasher last week - unfortunately, I have to return it already. As some other already noticed, the plastic side pieces are poor quality - I received the helmet with these pieces already fallen off and the glue traces visible on the helmet. But that is not my main problem with the helmet. Instead the hard shell simply is too small for my head. So be careful, other bigheads out there, this helmet is not made for you..."
1,"Yikes, another defective one","When I read some of the one-star reviews, I wrote them off as bad luck. Based on the dates I'd say Schwinn must have had a bad run on these helmets. The plastic fell off the sides as soon as I took it out of the shipping box. The only thing keeping the top shielding on was the package label zip-tie.Won't order a helmet online again, will take a rare trip to a B&M; store to find one -- and will go with another brand."
3,Gets the job done.,"This is a ""get what you pay for"" thing. I didn't want an expensive helmet that would get stolen, so I went with this. The plastic decorations on the helmet were literally falling off minutes after I got the package in the mail. No big deal though, just ripped them off and got riding. It seems safe and that's what counts!"
1,"Let your dog eat the money, it might help more (don't really)","This was an absolute waste of money, thank goodness it was cheap. It didn't prevent fleas when I sprayed it on the dogs before we went outside, and it didn't kill the fleas afterward. I would literally see a flea in their fur, saturate the area with the spray, and I could practically hear the flea going ""Weeee! Bath time!"" I'm pretty sure I could have come closer to getting rid of the fleas if I had just let the dogs eat a $5 bill. Doesn't sound like it would do much, you say? Exactly. Neither did this. Oh, and the smell is ridiculously gross. I'll never eat cloves again. It would have been acceptable if it had worked. But it didn't.I finally had to give in and put Frontline on the dogs, which I was hoping to avoid. I'm also using a 10% cedar oil spray, and that is helping, as we're dealing with the infestation. Don't waste your time or money or sanity with this."
4,Great Review,"This book was a big help with review of material. If I did not understand a conceptI went to a book with pictures. Also, questions at end of chapter helped."
3,A Classic,"I would recommend the play Our Town to anyone who likes classic American plays. Its vision of the everyday lives of a classic 1900's seems to catch the reader's eye with every page. Its obscure ending and hints of humor make the play complete, from start to finish. The play also adds a stage manager, who is really the narrator, which gives great detail about the town, and the citizens of it. This helps the reader understand the play much easier. All in all the play is an easy read, and seems as though it would be an easy production, which means I recommend this play to anyone."
3,Our Town English Reveiw,"As I was reading this book in English class I noticed that it was a great book for high schools to read. It has a strong them of living for the moment. I thought that as a high school student that it was some thing I should take to heart. This book packs a whole lot into a little space. As we read the book, we were assigned parts. I believe that that contributed to my better understanding of the book. I do not know if I will read this book again but I know I would love to go and see the book as a play. All of the stage directions in the book didn't not make sense when we read this book in a circle. Wilder went to great lengths to capture the feeling of the small town feel that makes this book successful. All of the people in the play work perfectly with one another and are well developed given the short length. While this book is a decent story that will make you think, I think it lakes the certain something to make it stand out as a book."
1,*snores*,If life is so boring why write about it doesn't that make this book boring. It was pointless and slow with people who need lives and need to get over themselves. I will not recomend this book to my worst enemy.
5,Reminds Me of My Childhood,I distinctly remember being introduced to Johnny Horton at the young age of 4. My dad had the album he'd bought back in 1960 for the whopping price of $2.35--and I could just kick myself for getting rid of it after my record player went the way of the dinosaurs. I hadn't heard any of the songs from this wonderful album since I was 13 or 14...and I remembered every word! Truly a timeless treasure belonging in the collection of any history buff!
2,So disappointed,"The second book in this series was so imaginative that this one was a real letdown. A problem in many historical novels (call this a mystery, I cannot) is that the characters act too contemporary for the time period. I would have preferred that to Ursula's turning in to a ""Had I But Known"" gothic heroine. And what's with the missing two years at the end? I'll probably never know because I certainly won't be looking for any future entries in this series."
1,pretensious pseudo-experimental garbage,"From boring, pretensious, ""art rock"" to rough, inaccessable, generic garbage, this record has it all! A complete waste of space in any record collection. Painful to listen to or even think about. This album is not as good as their last which was a true classic. Steve Albini's genius was short lived."
2,You get what you pay for,This razor does an adequate if unremarkable job of shaving your face. The battery recharge life is the shortest of any electric razor I have ever owned - after three shaves you definitely need to recharge. The darn thing even quit mid shave on me once - not a thrill when you are getting ready for work in the morning. It's also by far the loudest electric razor I ever heard. If you can live with the noise and constant charging then it's okay for the price. Personally I doubt I will wait too long before I replace it with a higher quality razor. I'd have given only 1 star if the price wasn't so low. I shouldn't have been so cheap & gotten something better to begin with!
1,Don't Buy,"The lights on mine don't work, the trimmer on it is terrible. Spend more money on something better. This razor is cheap."
1,I can't believe what I'm seeing...,"MGM splits the first season in half. You get 2 double sided discs, same format as the first release. No extras. I can only assume the episodes are NOT remastered. What is the point? True fans bought the first set. Casual fans will probably seek out their favorite episodes. What are the odds their favorites fall within the first 16 episodes?This set makes no sense whatsoever. Without ANY additional attractions, I don't see why anyone would buy this."
1,The silliest of the re-packaging yet...,"Hilarious. You get less content for roughly the same price as the entire ""first"" first set. Yea, ok, sure. If the Outer Limits were a comedy I could at least say this is ironic, but for now I'll stick with MORONIC."
3,not so great,though it is a cute swing..looks arent everything...the batteries ran low only after a short while...was disapionted and bought quiet a few batteries in just a few short months.
1,Dangerous!,"I received this swing as a gift. It was assembled according to instructions and the first time i put my son in it (1 week old) the support bar on the left side of the swing came unattached from the seat and down went the seat, baby and all. If it had happened on both sides, i'm sure my son would have been badly injured. I returned it to the store and got another, during assembly I realized that the anchor button on the new swing wasn't just faulty, it was MISSING! on the opposite side. So, two swings purchased, both had the same defect."
4,Saying this was a Wise Purchase,My daughter - in college - thinks this book is quite useful. Glad she does - as the professor gave her little choice about it as her textbook.
3,Won't buy another,"I gave it three stars because of quality of build and design. There were no usable instructions although something called instructions was in the box. The quality of the materials is sub-par, all plastic. I feel like I have to be very easy when moving the vacuum around for fear of breaking it. The hose is very cheap and kinks at the neck easily. The attachment storage was not really designed at all. There are no good placements for attachments or the hose.It does vacuum well and the noise level is not bad. Next time I will get a true commercial vac, not one that has a marketing label on it that says ""industrial""."
5,Wow! What a vacuum!,"High capacity, great suction, convenient tools, big wheels, sturdy handle. I am so glad I bought this versatile machine."
5,The best gift a 2 year old could ask for!,I purchased this doll almost a year ago for my daughter that just turned 2. She LOVES this doll and has slept with it every night since. Baby Stella goes with us EVERYWHERE! Even after almost a year it is still my daughter's favorite and the one constant toy/ doll she continues to love and play with daily. When my daughter was potty training she loved to take baby stella and show her how to go potty too! I love that the pacifier if flat on the back so my daughter isn't tempted to put it in her mouth and I'm suprised we still know where it is after almost a year- the magnet works great! I would recommend Stella to anyone she is so soft and adorable!
3,"David R. Debo, P.E.","To: Lost in AirI respectfully submit, that you need to appreciate Mr. Hicks' position. He has provided a conservative approach that will work in almost every situation. The empirical approach that you advocate may well work in most situations but I'll bet there is little margin built in for contingencies. True, your solution may cost less, which is important. But will the low-margin, low cost solution still work 1 or 2 years from now or will the pipe size be too small to allow for degradation/changes? Customer repeat business must be a consideration, too.I'm not trying to be confrontational, and I understand what you're saying. But you have to appreciate the position that Mr. Hicks must take in such a handbook, and he takes the only logical one, which is to be on the conservative side. People doing more than a couple of these calculations in a year in fact should consult more in-depth material, as you did.Regards,David R. Debo, P.E."
2,Cinderella Clock,"I was a little disappointed in the quality of this clock for the price. I am having to return it to the seller, because the alarm does not work."
3,"Poulan P3416 16"" chain saw",Saw will not start unless you follow directions exactly. Cuts wood fine. Good saw for the money.
1,chain saw,this chain saw is junk. when I. rec. it started the next time Iwent to use it can't get it started.called POULAN ALL I GOT WAS A RUN AROUND.AVOID this saw
4,Good chain saw for the price,"Poulan P3416 16-Inch 34cc 2-Cycle Gas Powered Chain SawI had a faulty chain break and the saw froze after 2 uses. Poulan honored their warranty and replaced the saw. Once you get the idea of starting up, it is a good saw for the money."
2,Quite dull,"I bought this CD from amazon.uk, and was pretty dissapointed. The tracks were very similar; they were all rather boring ballads, or middle-of-the-road pop- Céline Dion style to be honest. If you are a Céline fan then you might like this- slow songs, with an under-produced, quiet sound. If however, yopu are more into Lorie or Alizée do not get this."
2,A very confusing introduction to differential topology!,"I couldn't disagree more with the reviewer from Texas. I tried reading this book as a first year graduate student, and seemed to struggle with every line. It was only a year later, when taking a course on differential geometry, that an instructor, Doug Moore from UC Santa Barbara, bothered to make these ideas more clear in his excellent lecture notes. Usually when I give a bad review, I like to also recommend a much better book, but unfortunately I have none to offer in the area of Differential Topology. My instructor's solution was to switch to Milnor's ""Morse Theory"", but I found this just as bad if not worse. If someone knows of a better book, please let me know."
4,Keeps the kids busy for a couple of hours,Make sure the kids enjoy building things.It is keeping one of our boys busy for a couple of hours at a time.
5,Exciting introduction to electronics,"We purchased this for our 7 year old grandson who loves building things.Previously he had been exposed to erector sets Lincoln logs etc but this toy introduces a child thru a very clever design to the mysteries of electronics without that child feeling that ""something"" is quite different.I realize that clipping circuits together does not an electronics engineer make ( I am one) but the thrill of making something that beeps blinks and spins is a thrill for the little one. I am looking forward to seeing him develop further.I think the design of the toy is terrific.So far everything seems to work fine."
5,Never knew this could be so much fun!,"My son played with this at a children's learning museum once and has wanted one ever since. I was skeptical, but suggested it to his aunt for a birthday present. I am impressed at the huge variety of projects kids can do. He just opened it yesterday and he and his best friend have been playing with it for HOURS. Totally cool, very educational, encourages imagination and is just plain fun!!"
4,Snap Circuits Jr. SC100,My grandson thought it was great. He loves legos and this product was even more challenging. I will purchase more of them to make larger projects.
5,Best educational toy ever,"My 6 year old has been working her way through all the different projects since Christmas and having a blast. The product is brilliantly designed with durable parts which are just the right size for little hands and the projects are really interesting. But probably the best thing about the item is the instruction manual. If you're used to badly translated manuals with totally opaque diagrams, you will be amazed at how clearly the projects are laid out. The 6 year old picked up the manual and can do all the projects with no adult assistance! Unbelievable!"
4,Birthday party hit!,"We bought this for a friend's son for his 8th birthday. Interestingly, he wasn't too attracted to it at first, but his older brother tore it open and went straight to work! He had half of the exercises done before we left! Wasn't too long before the birthday boy caught on to the fun too. I didn't get to read the book in depth, but it seemed like the concepts of what was actually happening when you connect one part to another wasn't explained to well...then again, the kid moved so fast through each one that I didn't have a chance to read the words!"
3,Not much to it,"I think that building more than 100 projects is misleading but that's manipulative advertising for you. Lots of the ""different"" projects just have you change a piece or two. My son got bored with it very quickly, even with my help, and now it is just collecting dust.Now here is my review and mr BB can stop the crying. ""sniff"""
4,Electrical engineer...a snap,"My 8 y/o grandson is thoroughly intrigued with this set, and personally I hope he continues to advance with add-ons. Great educational product because it provides learning while having fun...a great mix for any toy or product for kids."
5,Fun with circuits!,"Purchased this as a Christmas gift for my 5 year old. He was very excited to have his own set, his brother got one last year. There are many circuits to build in the manual and you can also try build your own. I think he has the most fun the different sounds. It is a fun way to learn about circuits and electricity!"
3,SnapCircuit,"Excellent circuit maker. Very durable compared to the ones 10 yrs back. However, IC chips takes the fun out of electronics. Complex circuits can be made in a snap (literally!). But, I am not sure about the educational part of what is happening inside. So, far this is the best one I found in the market. Our 8 yr old is enjoying it. Good one to keep them occupied during summer break."
3,Not a Toy,"A great EDUCATIONAL kit, but not really a toy. It took a little one on one time with my son (8yrs) to get him going on this himself. He's proud of all the projects that he is able to complete. But it would have been helpful to know before hand that this set makes several different types of loud, IRRITATING noise. This kit does not seem to have the lasting entertainment value that other bulding toys have--my son likes to check off each project he has completed, and as he has completed most now (3 weeks after Christmas) the set is seldom played with. Experimentation with the kit is a little nervewracking for him as shortcircuiting the set could potentially ruin some of the components. His twin received the Snap Rover set with the idea that the two sets could combine for more creative fun. That hasn't happened.I wish I'd bought this set for homeschooling purposes, not as a Christmas gift."
5,Great toy!,"This is the type of toy that every parent loves! It is fun AND educational. My 6 year old son, loved it because it has real world projects (a light switch, a flying saucer toy, a doorbell, etc.) which he ""built"" himself. Each project takes about 5-10 minutes to put together and the instruction manual is VERY clear and easy to understand. It even expains the logic behind the projects (which he will probably understand a bit better when he is a bit older). I helped him with the first project and explained how to read the diagram in the manual. He took it from there and was building projects on his own. This toy is worth every penny! We have this 100 project, so I'd imagine that the 300 and 500 projects set would be even more fun."
5,Great toy!,"Our son is 3 1/2 and he loves this toy. It is a great educational toy and it comes with lots of fun projects. He needs our help building most of them but he enjoys watching, helping, and of course playing with them!"
5,Perfect family gift,"I bought this gift for my friends 7 year old boy. He, my daughter of the same age, his 5 year old brother, and the boys father played with it for hours! ""BEST TOY EVER!"" was said by kids and father 4 or 5 times during their various circuit creations. Made me so happy to give such a great gift!"
4,Rise against is and will always be awesome!,"Great CD! If your a rise against fan u definetly need this album in your collection. If ur missing it, get it NOW!! This cd shows where RA come from."
5,"Like the Angel, that you are! MASTERPIECE- 9 Stars","This is my second favourite CD of all time behind FFAF and also my second favourite band. THis CD is so killer and every track on this thing is amazing and a masterpiece on it's own. Like the angel and black masks and gasoline are my two favourite songs of this but every song is good. If you are a fan of cool punk of the street, pick this up and put wind breaker on, prepare to be blown away.Truly! Tornado of Awesomeness"
2,just really disappointing album,"This album brought the 1995 factice Ultravox Line-up. This is only factice because only Billy Curie comes from the original lune-up of the band. The rest is a patchwork of low musicians supporting Billy for this live. Well... as for the songs themself, the interpretations of tracks from Ingenuity are quite good because the members are the same... for the rest, this is just crappy So, consider this album as if it was more like a Billy Curie revival, but not an Ultravox live."
3,Pretty good...,"Great opening track -- too quiet at first and then, after you turn it up, it gets way really LOUD. Got to love it though; the authentic trad. acoustic blues start and the hard rocking blues follow up. Very cool.High-lights: Enough of the Blues, Stormy Monday (comparable to his excellent version of Cold Day in Hell).Low-lights: Picture of the Moon is a bit soppy, not bad though. I guess we had to have the mandatory ballad -- and Gary's previous ballads have been pretty darn good and very successful for him."
5,Again I LOVE it !!!!,"No matter what this guy comes out with, it's a big score for me, I love his stuff as much as anyone !!!!!!!!"
2,Disappointing,"While I bought the album based on the strength of the single Enough Of The Blues and a reviewers comparison to Roy Buchanon, it is not a good album. The songs are middling to fair without the energy or passion of R.B. The songs are not bad or even boring, just generic blues rock. Considering the amount of really great blues rock, this is disappointing and I'd recommend people buy other stuff. That said, the song Enough of the Blues is really good. If the rest of the album had been up to the same standard, it would have been really good."
1,Even a rating of one star is TOO high for this book.,Only Lugosi completests should purchase this book. It is filled with numerous factual errors and offers absolutely nothing new that has not already been covered by other books. Lugosi fans would be better served to buy Gary Don Rhode's or Greg Mank's books or any of a number of other Lugosi related works.
5,Very entertaining,"I've read Edmund Hillary's latest book. And now, for something completely different, we have Eric Newby's, um, ""short"" walk in the Hindu Kush. Newby is not at all a champion mountain climber like Hillary. Quite the opposite. But that is part of what makes this book interesting and funny. It is a great travel story, and I recommend it."
5,"Life-enriching, Inspirational and Heart-warming","When I just received this book through the mail, I flipped to a random page of this book and read it, I was hooked the first time! That's just the beginning. I read the first 50 pages and I was inspired to apply what I learned from this book on that same day, I truly found happiness. Not only did I acquired knowledge, but I found wisdom and beautiful realizations about life. What's so awesome is that when you read, you don't realize that you're reading. The only time I felt a little disturbed is when i have to flip the page, or direct my eyes to the next page. Rich Devos is a great man and he sure did a good job impacting my life. Props to you Rich."
1,BIG WASTE!,"When I first saw this item I thought, ""wow, what a great idea"". Then reality sunk in when I brought my baby home and realized that this was the stupidest thing. First, the hole didn't even land anywhere near my son's belly button. Second, the onesies seem to at least protect the belly button from the clothes you put on your baby where these onesies leave the belly button exposed to the clothes which can rub against the healing area. Last, the best thing for a healing belly button if you don't want to put a onesie over it is the side button tee shirts that they give you in the hospital. I swiped a few of those when we left the hospital and never used the two packs of these that I received at my shower. Not worth the money for maybe a week that your baby's belly button will be healing. Don't waste your money."
2,Shoddy,"The remote control broke within days of arrival and even when it did work it was difficult to manage. Overall, the quality of the item is pretty low."
1,Who are these characters,I've got a feeling this author wasn't at all familiar with Quantum Leap. The Sam and Al she's created are so far removed from the beloved characters from the TV series you'd think they both have personality disorders. I finished this book dislkike Sam and wondering just how crude Al could be. I had to pop in a couple of the DVD's to remind me of what great characters they were and how much fun QL could be.
3,What a Shame It's the Last,A very good attempt to tie up loose ends of Sam Beckett's leaps through time. Slightly disappointing ending but on the whole a good read
4,Once Again Gives Fans What They Want!,"Once again Carol has given us what the fans of QL have been missing, a good Sam and Al story. Carol continues to give us endearing human characters, flaws and all and not superhumans. As in all of Carol's previous story this one is a winner that does not disappoint! Highly recommend!"
2,Shelf flexes easily under load,"It looks nice, assembles quickly, and for low weight uses (toiletries, shoes, kitchen items) this shelf will probably do fine, but I bought it as a desktop computer stand and it is too weak for that or any other heavy objects.If you put any significant weight on it, you will see the metal start to bow immediately. When placed on the shelf, my computer will rock back and forth after a light touch. The computer is nowhere near the stated 200 lbs. load capacity, and even just pressing down with my hands made the sides of the shelf start to bow. While the flex in the metal will decrease noise due to vibration I'm going to find a stronger replacement and move this to a closet or something...."
1,Poor design,The design of this shelf does not allow for a stable surface. Locking the legs of the shelf is supposed to be accomplished through plastic sleeves that slip over the metal legs. It simply doesn't work well and the shelf is wobbly.
5,The Best!,"Works best if you use punched flights. They came as advertised and properly packaged. I really have to say, ""Thanks for the gumball Popeye!"""
4,Good Gift Item,Purchased as a gift for an outdoorsman. Think I hit the jackpot. I even found it interesting myself and you likely will also.
5,Wild America DVD,This DVD came in time for Christmas and my dad was happy to open it. These are good movies and I enjoy watching them.
3,Great wildlife series but poor packaging,"I gave this DVD set a three star rating because I thought the discs could have been placed in better, more durable cases, which would hold the DVD's securely in place. The outside box, made of thin cardboard, doesn't offer much protection to the set. The price of the item was low enough, but what the set came in was not of the best quality. The twelve DVD's, however, were in good condition and had a clear, bright picture.The series itself deserves a five star rating, being one the best nature documentaries ever made. And now you can own all of the complete episodes, which is much better than watching the edited version shown on television. Marty Stouffer's wildlife photography is something to behold, and his lively, personal hosting and narration are the best invitation to enjoy American wildlife. Therefore I must highly recommend the series for anyone who loves the natural world."
2,Beware Old Merchandise,This is the very same life preserver Amazon sent me except I didn't buy the sailing harness. This life preserver is supposed to have a five year life on the arming mechanisim but the one sent to me had only four years left. I suppose it had been setting on the shelf for a while. They are non-returnable so you take your chances when you order one. I bought a total of three and the other two were okay.
3,live review...,saw these guys live in a small club in Cincinnati. pretty cool - i was impressed with the amount of sound coming from just guitar and drums and the songs had good licks and hooks
5,love the fat handle,The well-padded handle of this cane is great for arthritic hands. And I like the shiny black finish. I barber-poled mine with red reflective tape and now I have a sturdy stylish mobility aid. Bottom line? Great for the price.
3,Sent me similar item but wrong one.,I ordered two MDS86415 canes but recieved two MDS86420 which were priced less than what i ordered. I will keep the canes but requested the price difference refunded.
3,read this before,great product easy to put together but check your box before signing mine had damage in the corner very disappointing
4,Before he went mad,"This is a very interesting documentary on the collapse of GM in the once booming town of Flint. It was made before Michael Moore became the fanatic antiamerican that he is today and primarily focuses on the people of Michigan who suffered at the hands of GM. While Moore is a socialist, this movie is tame and his sarcastic personality makes it enjoyable to watch. He even attacks Democratic Governor Jim Blanchard, something he would never do today because he has since been engrossed in the liberal political machine."
2,Misleading documentary,The events of the documentary were rearranged (not in chronological order) to make it more condemning. Not a truthful documentary. Avoid!
4,Influence has been felt worldwide.,"People around the world have told me that they love this movie and find it hard to believe it was made in the USA. Why so hard to believe? Because it seems so un-hollywood? That's what I figured was meant by that comment. But wait, there's more. What really surprised non-americans was that THIS was America. Looking like some third world country. The world shown here is so vivid, so depressing, it's hard to reconcile to the image we export to the world around us. Anyway, it's not a perfect movie, as Moore is obviously trying to create a certain image which has been pre-fabricated in his mind. But these pictures don't lie. This is the world happening away from the cameras and the lights. Away from the warm glow of the silver screen. The America we Americans ought not to forget."
5,Been wanting to see this for YEARS!,"In the late 90's I worked on projects at 2 of the existing GM plants in Flint. I was amazed at decayed around every corner. I drove by Buick City and just shook my head at the large area of closed manufacturing plants. I knew nothing about the city's history except that GM closed Buick City.Someone told me about this movie/documentary and it was in the back of my mind for years. Recently I started looking for it online, with no success. So, I checked Amazon and found it for less than $5, shipping included. I ordered it and as soon as the UPS guy dropped it off I watched it.It meet all of my expectation. The disc was marked as used, but had no scratches or fingerprints. It was in a plain case, not the original one I assume.I buy very few DVD as I'd rather rent them from Redbox. But, this is one I plan to keep. Not for the acting, but for the story of a company and locale that I have strong ties to."
3,"Good Value, Good Performance, a few issues","I am on my 2nd summer with my Swisher Z-Max and it has been a pretty decent machine. If it was powered by a Honda, in my opinion it would be the best value going. Don't get me wrong, the briggs has worked well, but I have another 60"" mower powered by a Honda that handles taller grass much better and gets better fuel economy.Mine has had some minor issues:One steering arm pivot point came loose (inside the chassis)Front frame member to front pivot axle member bolt came loose and fell outWhen mowing, driver tends to get a fair amount of grass in their lap that blows up from the front of the deckGator blades are junkI have 50 hours on mine and have replaced both deck belts. (seems a bit excessive)Yes, it does have a few issues, but when compared to what is available in the same price range it looks pretty good. Although I have had to do a bit of wrenching on it, I have to say that it is pretty easy to work on."
1,Oh dear God.,"You know, I own practically every album Ms. Ronstadt has made, including this one, so I know from which I am speaking. There are some of her albums that I have adored from the beginning... from the first time I listened. Some, for example ""Mad Love"" took a little getting used to. This album would not only take a lot of getting used to, but also a lot of alcohol in my system to EVER be of a mind to listen to again.She shrieks. She screams. She... I don't know... has a melt down...It's just plain awful. (in my opinion.)"
2,Linda -- what have you done?,"This is definately NOT the Linda Ronstadt that I have loved listening to for the past 30 years! I have been a Ronstadt fan since the early 70s. Loved her Nelson Riddle big band stuff, her Tucson Sessions album with Emmylou Harris, and just picked up her ""Frenesi"" album and love it too. But this... This is definately not the album to showcase her vocal talents. I could not even finish listening to it. The last CD I will buy without previewing the songs first. Skip it."
2,The rhythm has gone mad to the swing tunes,"I think ""Hummin' To Myself released in 2004"" is the last album of Linda Ronstadt now. And, I think that she has disappeared due to the failure of this album.The rhythm has gone mad to the swing tunes of up-tempo, though the ballad tunes are not bad. I think that Lavay SmithEverybody's Talkin' 'Bout Miss Thingalso failed as Linda. Lavay has also disappeared.I think Carly sings very good onMoonlight Serenade."
5,a great Ronstadt album,"This album has a real intimate feeling, as if the listener were sitting in a small jazz club. It avoids the schmaltz and breathes new life into these songs for those who remember them when they were new as well as those coming to them the first time around. A definite buy."
2,which one you get?,"The picture and Product Description are for The new Voyager 4.0 reChargeable, NEW FOR 2008, Luxeon 1 watt LED. Batteries: NiMH battery pack, Run Time (High/Low): 6-11 hours, 60+ flash. But the top says, ""Blackburn Voyager 4.0 Standard"", so who knows which one you get.Blackburn Voyager 4.0 Standard, Luxeon 1 watt LED, Run Time (High/Low): 4-10 hours, 50+ flash, Batteries: 4 AA."
3,Wish it was working,"I love the look of this swing. I think that the features it has and the price are great. However, after spending about 30 minutes in assembling the swing and adding the D-batteries, it did not turn on. I called Graco and they led me through a re-assembly process which did not work. Finally, the nice customer service rep decided to send me a new motor through the mail. It took 2 weeks to arrive, then when I opened it... it was just the hinge! The motor is located in the blue triangle shaped piece with the buttons. The opposite piece is only a hinge. After receiving this, I called customer service again. They did not believe me at first, but after a few minutes of describing the pieces, I was guaranteed to have a new motor within the next couple weeks. We'll see..."
4,A is for Alibi,"A is for Alibi was different. I liked the storyline, but this is the first book in the alphabet mysteries that I've read, where Kinsey's life was really threatened. I have enjoyed all of these books, this one seemed to have a lot more people possibly involved in the murder."
3,Not bad for a first book.,"The writing style was decent, at times humourous and the detective's personality really shines through the lines. The problem lies with the plot arrangement and the fore-shadowing made the ending too obvious. And, did we really need to have a sex scene? Yet, there holds promise in this series provided the author doesn't bungle it up. Book 2(B for Burglar) is an improvement from this one.2.5(rounded off to 3 'cos I'm feeling generous) out of 5."
4,"""A"" Gets an A-","Ah, a new female private eye series for me to explore. I liked it. The main character, Kinsey Millhone, is sharp, sexy and quite human. Well written, with a good cast of supporting characters, the book is perfect for weekend cuddling. There were too many female suspects in the story, though, which sometimes led to confusion. as to who was who. I look forward to reading ""B is for Burglar"" soon."
3,"""A"" is for Alibi",Strong language made unejoyable read for me. Lots of characters used making it hard to follow at times. Average read overall.
1,Maybe good in 1982 - don't bother starting in 2000,"I am sad that I missed out on this series when it started. I have read that Sue Grafton's Kinsey series is a ""must-read"" and has revolutionized the genre. However, trying to start this series in 2000 just didn't work for me. I am an avid mystery reader and I found this to be completly predictable, tiresome and downright boring. Maybe it was wonderful and different and surprising when it was written, but I just can't bear to read the other 16 or so to get to where the genre is today."
3,R is for Review,"I finally found the 'beginning' of Sue Grafton's alphabet so I could get in on this series from the start. I found 'Alibi' to be a refreshing change from some of the more recent crime novels I've read. The plot was straight out of '40s 'detective noir', and the'hard boiled PI' genre is usually more entertaining than the 'police procedurals' or 'amateur sleuth' stories I usually read.Kinsey Millhone may not be the most likable private eye, and 'Alibi' isn't the most exciting story, but I found her interesting enough to want to read more books in this series."
1,Dull and a torture to complete.,"Having been disappointed in my first Sue Grafton, N is for Noose, I was assured by a fan that the earlier books were better. A is for Alibi was a bigger disappointment and, unfortunately, I have one more book I bought to go. How did this author ever publish? I would give it zero stars, if I could."
4,A is for Alibi,Entertaining story! Interesting twist... I will finish the series. The story read like I would think a PI would talk.
2,Excellent Book. Implied Author Signature,The book title page shows the authors signature on the detail view. This prompted me to buy The Hard Back (I own the paperback and the whole series in one form or another). My copy does not have the signature (disappointed).The page should be revised to exclude the signature to avoid disappointment for the hard core fan.
3,I wasn't blown away but it was ok,As a whole this book was ok. It dragged for at least the first half of the book and would've benefited from a good editor. To be fair I just ended the Stephanie Plum series and I'm not sure anything will compare after that.
3,"5-star writing, 1-star mystery","This book is very well written. It does have a Sam-Spade feel about it, with many unpleasant details included to give it a noirish quality.The downside is that the mystery is not particularly mysterious. I had the whole thing solved well before the halfway point, which made much of the going rather dull. I suspect that anybody who has read much in the way of mysteries will not be in the dark for long, and will be very frustrated that this detective is ignoring things that ought to be obvious.So far this is the only Sue Grafton I've read, and it's good enough that I'll read more."
2,Couldn't finish it,"I've read much worse, but decided it was too boring to waste anymore time on. There was just nothing there as far as plot or characters to perk my interest, and at page 65 said to self: enough already."
2,"Not a great ""collection""","For the Deneuve fan, this really isn't the best collection of her work. ""Place Vendome"" was a terrific film, there's no doubt about it. ""Dangerous Liaisons"" was ok, but not the creme de la creme of definitive Deneuve. ""Pola X"" was a wretched film that Deneuve is only in for about 5-10 minutes in the beginning. And while I have not seen ""Kings and Queen"", I'm told that her screen time is minimal. How is a Catherine Deneuve Collection not going to include an Oscar nominated performance in ""Indochine?"" If you want the best of Deneuve, you're better off buying individual copies of ""Indochine,"" ""Place Vendome,"" ""Repulsion,"" ""Belle de Jour,"" ""East/West,"" and even ""Belle Maman"" if you can get your hands on it."
2,Expect the least and maybe you'll enjoy this,"If you know what to expect from this silly film, namely, almost no naked girls, extremely idiotic dialogs, a flunking script, and flunking acting, you might just enjoy it. It did remind me of Charlie's Angels, esp. in style, but I found it much less entertaining and enjoyable than the silly-but-cool Charlie's Angels.Thirty minutes into the film, one of the orphan girls opines ""This is total BS. It was BS from day one."" This pretty much sums up the film, which proves that attractive and fairly talented actors or actresses don't necessarily know how to act, esp. when the script is a total joke."
4,A sexy action movie.,"I saw this movie and I was surprised how good the action scenes were. There is only english speaking in this Hong Kong movie, and there's no cantonese. I thought the storyline was kinda interesting. It's about a woman who was kidnapped when she was a kid and trained to be a professional killer along with other girls. Then things changed for her during a mission in HK, when she was seen by her mother and caught by a CIA agent who recognize her when they were kids. After that, there's some twist and turns in the storyline. What I liked most about this movie was the action scenes. There's a lot of cool martial arts fighting and unique killings. Some of the action scenes are matrix like. The fighting scene I liked the most was Maggie Q fighting Jewel Lee at the house, because of how the fight ended. What I didn't like much in this movie was some of the music. The music is kinda cheesy and some of the acting was weak."
5,Wonderful read about WWII British submarines,"This is a wonderfully written semi-autobiographical book following a man from initial acceptance into the British submarine community all the way thru to command. While some Americans may think its not applicable based on its roots, I would argue that it is very applicable, even for today. He shares many comical and some harrowing tales.Worth the buy, I have three!"
5,Even Better Than The First One...,"Cabana Beach Club II has an even better offering of chill music than it's predecessor (Cabana Beach Club), with a smooth musical flow from tune to tune. I like the fact that it's more even-paced, not too much techno and has minimal vocal tracks. I wish they had continued this series beyond the first two CD's, they are truly relaxation for the mind and soul..."
1,Only for winter,This is a product to buy only if the weather conditions are very extremely cold. Otherwise you become completely bored.
2,Good BUT,"I bought this like 7 or 8 years agoIt was good, let's say that it made my 15w pedal sound way louder and cooler (like if it was -at least -a 30 w)BUT mine had A LITTLE HUGE TROUBLE, after playing (lets say 40 min) it would get over heatedand STOP WORKING (it would work til it had cooled, like an hour after, and then, the same would happen)I asked for a change of unit, but it had THE SAME ISSUE...I still have it (not because I wanted to, but because the store wouldnt give me my money back =\)"
5,Volleyball Cart,This Champion Sports folding Volleyball cart has been great for our recreation center. It's perfect height for players to grab a ball quickly. It has also been great for storage of our volleyballs. Great price!Highly reccomended product!
1,The Hitchiker 1953,"Don't waste your money! The video quality is so horrible it is unwatchable! Just like it was recorded with a camera set-up in front off a TV screen, in fact the movie isn't even centered on the screen!I saw his movie on TCM recently and it was wonderful. I really liked it, so I wanted a copy for myself , but was very dissapointed with the quality of what was sent,"
3,A good book about character but not much about Reagan the man,D'Souza does a decent job in his biography on the character of Reagan. My biggest complaint with this book is that it does not actually tell us anything about Reagan and his presidency. So much times is spent on the character that by the time you are done understanding Reagan's moral values the book is over and I felt I learned nothing about what Reagan did and how these values played out. For those who have really studied Reagan it is a great addition but if you are looking for only one book try Richard Reeves.
2,Very Disappointing,"This book was highly recommended to me but I was forced to dissent from popular opinion.While this book was factually interesting, it was also a very glossed-over look at a president who was successful enough that no glossing-over is necessary. Mr. D'Souza needs to learn that it is okay to admit that Reagan was a flesh-and-blood human being like the rest of us and that his accomplishments stand on their own merit.A good story, but not very well written."
5,Ronald Reagan: Dumb as a Fox!,"If you like Ronald Reagan, you will love this book. If you don't care for Ronald Reagan, you just might after reading this book. This is a well researched book about a truly great and extrordinary man who was one of our very best Presidents. This behind the scenes look at Ronald Reagan shows that he molded the world unto himself. He knew what he was doing all along on countless fronts. He, more that any other person, was responsible for the collapse of the Soviet Union with his 'Star Wars' scare tactic. The media never gave Ronald Reagan enough credit for the things that he accomplished. They usually portrayed him as being a little dumb, and Reagan used that to his advantage. Read how and why Reagan was as dumb as a fox!"
2,Comic Insights: The Art of Stand-up Comedy,"Rather shallow and repetitive. Then again, comics are gifted humans and their art and skills come from practice, practice, practice and inherent gifts. You can't teach funny but it would be great if the author had included some who didn't say the same thing everyone else said! It is also dated."
2,Lame,"""Comic Insights"" offers very little in terms of concrete and useful information as to how to be a stand-up comedian, and how to do a stand-up routine. A lot of the advice -- work hard on your routine, plan, record yourself, watch comedians you admire and make notes -- is entirely obvious. But the major crime of this book is -- given the fact that it's written be a professional comedian with a lot of writing credits -- that it's not funny or fun to read."
3,not up to the standards i had come to expect,"after reading the first 2 sections of hamilton's night's dawn trilogy (and while waiting for the conclusion), i decided to read other books by the author. i realize that this was his first book, but the rest of his work seems to be at the next level. although the characters in this book are interesting, and their ""quasi-psy"" powers fun, the overall level of depth is simply not there. it is possible, i assume, that the next 2 books in the series would prove to be better, but the adventures of greg mandel just didn't prove to be interesting enough to read them."
3,different thinking about silver,thought this to be holly grail.been reading about the difference between ionic and real silver.seems ionic is better for topical non is good for ingestion. will stick with organic virgin coconut oil.
2,A little bit of information for an expensive price.,"I am working as a civil engineer in a design office active in constructing light gauge steel structures. I have bought the book to obtain a guide or some kind of a handbook which includes some guidelines or procedures for typical structural steel design applications. But i hava found the book too superficial. I wish the book handled the subjects in a little bit detailed way. And I wish there were flowcharts for designing with steel. The only good thing about the book is the example projects at the end of the book. As a result I do not advise this book to anyone because it is expensive too. Pay half more and buy the Structural Steel Designer's Handbook, which includes all the information in this book and much much more.Do not pay attention to the number of pages written here, since size of the book is nearly the size of a pocket book."
3,Previous reader didn't read the book too carefully,"Had the critic who slammed Ms. Everett's history in SWEET VIOLET bothered to read it closely or read any other book in the series, she would have realized that the family owns property in town and that Violet's mother doesn't ""commute"" from the plantation because she has employees who run the shop for her, a shop she started 20 yrs. ago from economic necessity in the first book LOVING LILY. The reader also doesn't understand the lack of class structure in 18th c. America -- women did work and one of Williamsburg's most popular taverns today is Cristiana Campbell's named for its (historically accurate) female owner. Plenty of women worked in the Colonies; Violet's mother only moved to a plantation out of town when she married a landowner. Read the other books!"
5,Lagwagon at their best,"This album is amazing. It has some of the best guitar riffs punk has to offer, only to be coupled by great melodic sounds, and excellent lyrics. ""Burn"", ""Dividers"", ""Baggage"", and ""Billionaire"" are only a couple of the exceptional songs on this album. Go buy this album if you even if you remotely like punk rock."
5,Worth the wait,"While this cd doesn't immediately strike you as great, be persistent and keep playing it. It won't be long before the melodies start to hit and you realize that Lagwagon hasn't lost a step in the years it took for them to finally put out another cd. Like all their albums before this one, it has a different kind of ""Lagwagon sound"" and it is good. Who knows if it's their best...How can you distinguish the best cd out of so many great ones? Bottom line, Lagwagon put out another great cd, while showing that they may be getting a little older and enjoying more varieties of music by slowing down the pace a little and mixing in a few surprises. Prepare to be blown away by ""Never Stops"" and ""Lullaby."""
3,Let down,Good? Yes. Worth the 5 year wait? No.Let's Talk About Feelings will never be beat. I understand why these guys were reluctant to keep going in fear of growing stale...
5,Good book,"The book was excellent but it's the author's merit. Transportation was fast, faster than promised.I would recommend it to everyone."
2,Not what I expected,"I love Maysa's voice, but this CD is nothing special. The songs just aren't that good. None of the songs made me want to listen twice. I am disappointed with this effort."
3,Broken pieces,"When we received this order there were some broken pieces. I emailed customer support, and they sent us a new order that same day. They told us to return the original order, and that we didn't need to return the broken pieces. When the new order arrived, there were some broken pieces in that order. We were able to get a full set from mixing and matching the two sets. We were happy with the prompt and curtious actions from customer service. The pieces were probably broken in shipping so I doubt it was Amazon's fault."
1,RECYCLED DECADE,"I hate this because I am a great fan . . . but I have to admit that these guys haven't really done much lately.Their shows are AMAZING! The stuff of legend, but they seem to have not had much commitment to newstudio projects asides from the occasional remix. This is all stuff that has been recycled from the past decade.It really is a shame because the talent is there, I wish I didn't have to say this, but, I call as I see it."
4,Windows automation we were waiting for,"I appreciated Mr. Esposito's deep knowledge of WSH and his tipically italian colloquial style. No other book I read about WSH was so clear and rich of detailed advices about system management, task automation and COM. The custom components included inspire you to do more and more through COM: I seamlessly found myself ""scripting"" on windows the same things that previously I could afford only on my Unix systems, and in a native language. Together with a good VB and JS language reference, this book is a MUST for every windows system administrator."
5,The ABCs of LIfe - an incredibly valuable resource,"I am a college student interested in education and child development so when I saw this book I knew I had to read it. Immediately after I started it, I realized this is not a book to read once and file away on the bookshelf. I feel I will use it as a reference for both my future career and my future family life. Not only does the book present and describe things like self-confidence, self-control, and responsibilty, but it provides creative, interesting ways to teach these skills to children. Because of this, I think this book can have a profound effect on readers of all ages. Lesson One, thank you for your wonderful work."
3,Another Band That Can't Duplicate Previous Magic,"A good cd...not great....not sounding like the Shooting Star of old, which I really liked. For those with a more open mind than mine, it's probably better than passable melodic rock."
2,No Star Shooting Here,"I have every album, DVD and have seen them in concert. Buy any other album than this one. There is not one song that could have been placed on any other CD/Album. Someone in the recording studio should have told them to listen to old Shooting Star before trying to fake this one.I hope this is not their last CD, but it could be."
2,A Disappointment,"I hate to rain on everybody's parade, but this book did not live up to the praise it received in other reviews. There are really only 90 pages of text. The rest of the book is footnotes repeated in the bibliography, a list of treatment agencies, and a glossary. The writing is often repititious or uninformative, with statements like ""Ecstasy has, indeed, been the 'drug of choice' for many years now."" The frequent use of quotation marks grows incredibly annoying-- like getting elbowed in the ribs after every point. The saddest part is, this is still probably the best book available on the topic."
4,"excellent quality, but cutting surface is small","I really liked the finish on this cutting board... nice and smooth, yet extremely solid. My problem is that the cutting surface area is too tight to do any serious work. You have to realize that the dimensions listed are measured at the center extremities... it tapers off considerably. I'll be returning this and reordering, one size up."
3,On my Kindle,"I intend to study the English Grammar to beef-up to poor education in our school systems that I went through when I was young. Also for those wanting to learn a foreign language, the more you understand English the better you’ll do in a foreign language."
2,picture doesnt match colors,"I bought this and the colors are much golder than expected. In dim light it looks bronze/brown. Also, the material patches between the silk started ripping only 1 month later, before i had even washed it.Not good quality even for 40 bucks."
1,The best of this poor book is it's title.,"The book promises I will pee in my pants, and then confronts me with poorly written rather sad stories without twist. It was a bad buy."
2,"Another Photo Essay [Blah, Blah]","This book, photographed in Benin, West Africa is a companion to a yet to be released German documentary of the same name. It offers little in the way of knowledge of the Voodoo (Vodou) religion. Mostly a book of photos, it's a little overly ""arty."" The stupid cover photo aside, the book does have a few interesting black & white photographs, but I wouldn't spend the money to get them, the quality of the printing leaves something to be desired.In the text there are some snippits of oral tradition that would be worth someone developing. Until then I suggest Herskovitz's Dahomean Narratives.I'm still waiting for a good volume on West African Vodou..."
1,Just awful,"Many times, authors who are the opposite sex of their main character do a pretty good job of ""getting inside the head"" of that character. Not so in this case. This guy makes it sound like a woman's loss of virginity leaves her hemorrhaging for days. Then he throws in ample doses of female homosexuality taking place in the late 19th and early 20th century - completely unbelievable. While homosexuality has been around since Biblical times, it was frowned upon by society in the time period in which this story is being told. I would also say that it doesn't add anything to the story, but then, the story itself isn't worth much, either. It amazes me that garbage like this can be highly praised and called ""literature,"" when I wouldn't even use it to line a bird cage. This is one of those books that I wish I'd never read, but like the train wreck that you cannot ""unsee,"" I'll just have to do my best to forget about it."
2,This book is excrutiatingly I boring,"While the author has some interesting points to make, he is no storyteller. I found the massive book a huge snooze."
5,awesome,"Thanks a bunch. The book came in promptly as promised and in wonderful condition; no tears, tarnishes, or anything of the sort."
5,Tractor - 'The Way We Live / A Candle For Judith' (See For Miles),"A must-have fabulous 2-fer-1 import of Tractor's first two releases, from 1971-1972. Since I never pay much attention to bands / performers changing their names, I consider all of this lengthy title to be Tractor. Just shows you how this incredible duo of Jim Milne {guitarist & vocals} and Steve Clayton {drummer, piano & flute} could seriously give any other artist from their era a 'good' run for their money. Tracks here I was blown away with were the jamming ""Storm"", ""Willow"", the somewhat T. Rex-like ""The Way Ahead"", the unforgettable ""Little Girl In Yellow"" and their finely played gem ""Take The Journey"", this cut really should've done more for the duo. Lesser known UK psych that deserves more praise than they ever got. Tractor still exists, today. Look for their live DVD, on Ozit Records. Essential."
5,Great Bag,"I bought this bag for my wife. She said this is one of the greatest bags she ever had. she loves it. I seldom get some thing for her that she really enjoy, but this is the one. It is a brief case but definately looks fashionable."
2,Not worth it at all!,Class of Nuke 'Em High part 1 is OK (it IS a classic in gore movies).Part 2 and part 3 shouldnt even EXIST!It ain't like the serie Evil Dead..the first one is the only one you need to buy..the 2 others ain't worth the money spent to create those crappy movies.On the + side: You get a sticker of I when to Class of NUKE 'EM HIGH! Woohooo! ;)Conclusion..buy Class of Nuke 'Em High Part 1 and thats IT! Don't do the same error like I did.
5,Best of Bose,"Although Wikipedia says this album didn't get good reviews, I thinks it's the best beside Papito, of course. The videos are good too."
3,no llena las expectativas,"Siendo un fan de Bose desde los 80s, y habiendo leido muchas criticas muy positivas de Velvetina, compre el cd+dvd con altas expectativas. Bose nos ha dado grandes albums desde que encontro su nicho con Bandido, pero este no es uno de los mejores. Tiene algunas canciones buenas, pero en general es olvidable y se queda muy corto comparado a los logros pasados (y futuros, porque Papito resulto ser superior tambien). Dos y media estrellas."
4,nice for price,"these headphones are nie for the price. the quality is good, color is sick, and they are lightweight. the only negatives are that if you play them too loud they will break quickly, and are not very durable if you are like me and use them for snowboarding.otherwise they are great for video editing, filming, or just listenin to music."
5,"Great Price, Wonderful Headphones","I'm always looking for nice sounding, comfortable headphones. I've tried many different brands and styles, it is not easy to find a really good set of headphones that are attractive, comfortable, sound great, and affordable, so I wasn't expecting much for the price. I ordered these mainly because of the retro look and the color. When I hooked them up to my Ipod the sound was amazing, nice light weight and comfortable. This is a great buy. Wonderful sound, cool looks. I'm very happy with my purchase, worth the price and more."
4,hedphonesGO,"ima be short and sweet here. they look awesome. i like big bulky and green. thumbs up for that. after a little while they hurt my ears but that may be because my ears are shaped like suction cups. im pretty sure when i turn the volume all the way up anyone around me can hear what im listening to because i always get funny looks but i dont care because they sound prettydamn awesome. and im thinkin theyre not too delicate either, since theyre fine and unbroken and i just toss these things in my bag all the time. in closing the headstrap reminds me of bandaids."
3,It's ok,"It's a fun book to read through once, but I honestly haven't made anything out of it. On a positive note, the plastic comb binding was shattered when it arrived, and the seller promptly responded and refunded my money, which I very much appreciated."
3,Eccentric Sax Playing Busker,"For some wierd reason the review I wrote years ago about Principal Edwards Magic Theatre's album ""Soundtrack"" got tagged onto poor old Lol Coxhill's album ""Ear of the Beholder"" which must have been very confusing to anyone reading the review, no wonder nobody found it helpful! Anyway, Lol is famously the guy who was playing sax in the street when a certain Joni Mitchell heard him and was inspired to write ""For Free"". Lol certainly does play real good, but there is some decidedly odd stuff here as well. You're never quite sure if he is playing it for laughs a la Bonzo Dog Band, or if he really is crazy. As long as you're not too worried about political correctness you may well get a blast out of this totally unique, eccentric collection from one of the true individuals on the music scene."
4,So You Missed Them in Concert!,"This is the first ""On the Road"" Series that I have listened to....this will not be the last. Great quality and great jams. Original, lively and inventive. Mixture of rock, jazz and bluegrass. Especially liked ""Cardinal Jam"" and ""Outside and Inside""....nice licks.If you missed them in concert, buy one of these CDs...you will feel the energy and not be disappointed. Louisville, KY knows!"
2,Expensive,I can not beleive how much cheaper it is at a hardware store. My first experence with a welder and this rod. It had good perforance but maybe the 1/2 lb I bought was not close to a 1/2 lb more like 1/4 lb.
5,Review of Bukowski in Pictures,I own a copy of this book and was so impressed by it I ordered a copy for a friend. An excellent book that I thumb through over and over again. It really helps you capture who Charles Bukowski was. I love it! Very well done. Factual. Emotional. Informative. Beautiful.
2,UPDATED,"This is a small book, maybe good for beginners. However, it may be educational to some point, dated for 2011. With the new technologies available to consumers, the book is definitely way behind the times."
3,Good aircraft design overview,"Pretty decent book overall. I suggest it more for the student than the professional, however. Also, be careful not to extrapolate beyond his emperical equations or you get completely bogus results. Also, the book is very weak on the subject of piston engine & propeller combinations."
3,Cute,"This books is cute, and funny, but not quite as good as the first two books in the series. I would have found a slightly less conventional ending, with the frog not turning into a prince, but still winning the princess, more emotionally satisfying, and truer to the two main characters. Still this was a fun read."
5,Smoking show of the tour,I attended 12 shows on the Spring Tour and this was by far the best of them all. Outside under the stars on a beautiful cool night in South Florida after the band had been playing indoors for several months. They rocked right from the start with a tremendous first set. Do yourself a favor and buy this CD. You will not be sorry.......
5,excellent,Very happy with the book and the customer service. The book was in the exact condition it was said to be.
2,A disappointment given all the talent involved,"I stumbled across a description of this film a few years back and thought ""How did I miss this one?!? Louis Malle, Donald Sutherland, Sean Penn, Jack Warden, & Wallace Shawn in San Francisco and I've never seen it (or even heard of it)?!??!"" Well, turns out there's a good reason why: it's supposed to be a funny, breezy film, but it's actually very dull and joyless. Moreover, the soundtrack is wretched 80s synth sounds punctuated by a cacophonous Michael McDonald tune that plays over the credits. It's also a boring, pointless film and a challenge to watch so much talent return so little; almost as if no one tried very hard. Easily the worst performance I've seen for Donald Sutherland. On the other hand, Wallace Shawn and Sean Penn are quite good. However, if you're curious about this based upon who was involved...don't bother."
1,Nice collection of songs don't ring true,"This cool collection of 999 songs is lacking the earlier spunk and power of the original recordings. Why make a really good collection of 999 songs and not put the original recordings? Recording is smoother and better sound, but since when does punk need that? Raw energy of earlier recordings far out shine these re-done classic 999 songs."
1,"Accurate video, but not what I was wanting","This video, while very detailed and full of accurate information just wasn't what I was looking for. The South Kaibab and the Bright Angel trails kicked my tail ... I was looking for something that would show what I felt when I hiked them. I will hike them again. I don't want to die knowing I got whipped that bad by those two trails."
4,excellent surprise!!!,"when I first listen smog in a radio station here in mexico city, I was wonder how an entire album would sound, and when I get ""red apple falls"" randomly I was amazed by the power of the lyrics and the sound itself, I don't now how this band is not that famous yet (and it'll never gonna be for sure, but still it's really worth listening!!!!)"
2,"Ideas are compelling, but the writing is dated & repetitious","I found it hard not to skim large sections of this book. Horney repeats herself over and over again. The entire 380 page book could easily be condensed into a single chapter. Many of her ideas are so integrated into modern thought (ie self-realization, tyranny of the should, alienation from self) that it is difficult to fully appreciate her originality today. As a piece of intellectual history, it makes interesting reading. But in terms of clinical relevance, its usefulness is quite limited. I, too, chose to read this because Yalom wrote in ""Gift of Therapy"" that he found it one the most helpful therapy books during his training. How times have changed! ""Gift of Therapy"" is a ""must-read"" for any therapist, but Horney's book is a ""pass."""
4,Hours of entertainment.,I haven't laughed so hard in a long time. Great rainy day book. The reading level is more around a teenager level. Not for little kids to read on their own. Fun reading for young and old alike. I look forward to reading it again and again.
2,Mildly interesting biography of 3 decades of experience,"The maps of South America & Africa were confusing - they put a lot of effort into identifying most of the Countries, but many of them didn't feature in the text, so why give the Geography lesson?The 20 photographs were of some interest, but there was only one photo of a patient with symptoms, and only one of a virus - I wish there'd been more of those and less of head & shoulders like having a meal and daughter's high-school graduation?Great disappointment - absolutely no Index!The penultimate Chapter 11 gives a prediction of Avian Flu originating in Thailand - just what we're getting news about this month (Jan 2004) - but this book was published in 1997. Given the age of the book, its probably not surprising that Chapter 12 is very out of date (as in 'wrong') regarding its description of BSE (Mad Cow Disease) & CJD.Was it necessary that we be told what the wife of the 'ghost writer' does for a living?"
2,Not what was expected,"Was wanting a nice underarmour shirt, but this one was something I could get at Walmart. Not the quality of what I wanted."
3,Not true to size,"This shirt is not true to size, way to big for my son. I thought he would be happy about it but he says it's way too big for him. They are very comfortable to wear and easy to care for. The material leaves much to be desired though...what a shame. I have purchased other UA for my son and hubby and they loved it. This one is not one of our favourites."
2,only mediocre,"This book was a disappointment. When answering the practice quesitons, if you got it wrong, the software just parroted back the question in the form of a statement. No explanation, no reference back to the book. The book is only mediocre itself, sometimes poorly written, and very poorly edited. Unfortunately, it's better than the CISA Review Manual, which is itself just terrible, full of grammatical and spelling errors and atrocious writing. For those taking the June 2006 exam, I hope something better comes out in early '06!"
2,Explinations lacking,"After the long awaited Exam Cram 2 was finally published I was very happy to receive the book. I installed the SW on my computer with no trouble. The trouble came when I took the practice exams. When questions were explained as to why that particular answer was right, all it did was read the right answer back to you, there was no further explanation to help you understand. All in all I was disappointed with this book. If the author had explained the subject matter more I would have liked the book more, but I don't feel like it helped me at all."
2,Background info on day trading and never takes off,"This is a book written at a time when Nasdaq was very close to its pinnacle in 1999. Not from hindsight (of the index level today), but sheerly by content, the book is full of flaws in nearly every topic it covers, especially those on Technical Analysis. Facts, and pure facts were abundant. However, trading system, strategy and insight were in short supply. The authors might have been so optimisstic and carried away by the beautiful picture they painted about trading in Nasdaq that money management and discipline had rarely been mentioned, and the ""real tactics for real profits anytime anywhere"" on the front cover were by and large absent.p.s. This book contains the highest number of cartoon (eight) in those trading books I ever read. Sadly, most were drawn with one single theme, that ""Day Trading would annihilate the brokers"". That should have implied something about the direction and quality of the book, which I had mistakenly ignored."
4,Smart day Trading,"Exceptional ""how-to"" introduction to Small Order Execution System as basis for informed trading that bypasses the brokers' fees and spreads, improves odds for favorable trades, and instills trading discipline to minimize losses. Many practical insights to enhance success. Heart of the book is the explanation of a ""Trading Screen"" that allows monitoring of market action for up to four stocks; includes price/volume charts and bid/ask quotes from market makers. (Reader can ignore occasional hype for writers' services.) Includes a short primer on technical analysis to alert day trader to what prompts technicians to move in or out of stocks. A worthwhile investment of time for the novice considering serious trading as a major source of income."
4,Zero and infinity,"Babylonians invented it, Indians worshipped it, Greeks abhorred it. Zero has been a problematic number for a long time. European mathematicians followed Greek footsteps, until they finally realized how important thing zero was for advanced mathematics.Seife presents us the history of zero and its sister concept infinity, not only in mathematics, but also in physics and quantum mechanics. Zero is an entertaining book, if a bit light. For quick popular science entertainment purposes it's a good choice. (Review based on the Finnish translation.)"
4,One of the best in Math's history,"The history of 0 is succintly delineated. Yet, in the ""The Divine Wager"", I found confusing to understand the envelope analogy which is not clearly stated (bottom of page 101 to beginning of 102) resulting a wrong assumption from the start."
4,great fun,"Clear writing, rare in math / science books, shines throughout here. The final few chapters of this book are in `woo woo' land [which is 4 stars to zero side of Star Trek Voyager and on to infinity'] but this tome is a great read. It is not at all a math heavy work ... I suspect that a fair grip on 4th grade arithmetic would do it. Great for a `book report' for a kid who `hates math'."
1,Don't buy this cd,"I love Chelsea, and was initially excited when I found this cd of early material, but this cd is horrible. It's petty much made up of crappy quality demos. Really crappy quality demos! Now, there's a place for demo type material, such as those that appear as bounus tracks on the re-release of Chelsea's self titled 1st LP. Those demos are solid, raw sounding tracks that give the listener a feel for how the songs were shaping up prior to their final recorded versions.The demos on this cd, however, have the feel of versions that were so badly recorded that they resided on the cutting room floor until some schmuck decided to piece them toghether on this cd.I am usuall fairly forgiving of medocre cd's, but I bought this used at a local record shop and sold it back about a week later.Don't buy this cd!"
5,Sexy and Dark~My two favorite combinations,"Frankly I loved this book. I think this series is developing pretty good. Its decadant, sensual, and hedonistic. Makes me wish I could be in the Unseelghie Court. The dark faeries seem to have a passion that I think is lacking in the world today. Meridith is a strong woman and she isnt afraid to be strong AND sensual at the same time and what I wouldnt give to have her male harem!!!If you tread on the dark side then read this book!!"
5,Avid reader of Laurell K. Hamilton books,I loved her book (as I do all of her books). The world that she creates in her books is unique. The different caracters and plots are explained well and the descriptions she uses make you feel like you are there. I think fiction books are make to take you away to another world and give you an adventure or a romance and this one definatly does. I would recommend this book to everyone (over 18 of course). I can't wait till the next one!
5,Good squel with lots of cool LKH twists,"I just got this book and was thrilled. I read it in one night! Starting up where book one, Kiss of Shadows left of, the main character, Meredith Gentry, Faerie Princess is trying to become pregnant. She has her own personal harem and as trashy-romancy as this sounds, its actually quite a suspensful story.Deciding which man she would idealy want as her King and lover is just one of her decisions that she must make. Engaging and great in the usual Laurel k. Hamilton style, we get a large mix of thrills, passion, romance, suspense and action as a blockbuster hit movie.The only drawback is that it leaves you hanging at the end, waiting for more. I would reccomend this book highly, but only if you read the first book beforehand."
5,Merry Gentry's giving Anita Blake a run for the money!!!,"A friend suggested I try Laurell's Merry Gentry series after I devoured all of her Anita Blake: Vampire Hunter books. I was skeptical -- could they be as much fun? Well, I am here to assure you -- they're even more fun! I read both Kiss of Shadows and Caress of Twilight back to back, and came away amazed at the author's imagination. Sexy, scary, suspenseful and just plain fun to read. (Oh, and did I mention the sex ???)If anything, Laurell K. Hamilton is getting better with each book, and she deserves to find a wider audience. A Caress of Twilight just pushes the envelope of her talent a little further. Highly recommended."
1,Discrepancies in 'A Caress of Twilight',"Bitterly, bitterly, bitterly disappointed.Page 3 still has the WRONG colors for Nicca, even after an assurance from the publisher that the errors in the ARC would be corrected before publication. The ARC was more of the same from the first Merry Gentry and the last Anita Blake. *sigh*Why should I waste my time and money on an author who can't be bothered to remember her own characters? And if the author's memory is that inept, shouldn't editors and proofreaders pick up on discrepancies?Will I read this hardback edition that I made a special trip to the bookstore for? Probably not. It's lying on the floor in a corner from when I flung it across the room at page 3.Sign me a disappointed, and vocal, FORMER fan."
5,Scottish Heritage in Georgia,Ms. Davis is delicious! I have lived in Georgia all my life and never knew the Scottish heritage that centered around Savannah. The people of her book came alive on the page and you could feel their love for each other and Christ. The angst and desires that they had to control to maintain their deep beliefs inspired me. The history of a British group of soldiers was well-researched and balanced with a levity that showed that Ms. Davis loves people and all their foibles.This book is a must read for folks who believe in the true spirit of love and good things come to those who wait.Buy this one and enjoy!
2,Poorly Recorded Live Show,"This is a real shame because there's some great material on here. Basically you can hear vocals and drums but the guitars are buried DEEP in the mix. Most of the material is taken from the fantastic and overlooked Frenz Experiment album. If you're a completist you may want it for the first song ""Just Waiting"" which is a cover that doesn't appear on any other release, as far as I know. It's a very poppy, lighthearted number with a very infectious melody."
5,It's so cute!,"I remember having this toy as a little kid. And I was so upset when I lost my plushie!Of course, when I saw this guy for sale, I knew I much have him!I got it for about $45 and Pikachu is working well. Mine looked like it was played a lot by the previous owners (the ears are a little bent), but other than that, it works well! My little sister loves it! It's so cute!The only complaint that I have is that why do people want to sell this little plushie for $99?!?!?Get this toy if you find it at a good price! Don't waste your money if someone is trying to sell a used one for $99!"
4,SOA!!!,Great show if you like action and dont mind watching your favorite charactors get killed off! Very few people are safe on this show!
5,Superb!,"There really isn't much more to say. The acting, writing, direction...all of the highest caliber. I really loved the twists this season (4) and I think I may have to break down and purchase season 5 just to find out ""what next??!!"""
2,Bad disk 1,"I missed some of the last season, and wanted to catch up. Unfortunately, disc #1 is bad. It skips, freezes, just all around bad news. Disc 2 and 3 are fine, but that's not the point. I asked for a return, and was emailed the forms. IU sent the set back, asking for a replacement, but got a credit instead. Oh well, at least I got my money back. Amazon is always great to deal with, and this is not their fault."
5,SOA ROCKS,The best season yet . Just when you think you have it figured out you realize you don't. Jax is at his best.
5,Christmas gift,I am very happy with the delivery of the DVD. It took less time to get here then they said it would. As far as the quality of it then I'm not sure cause it was a Christmas present for someone that collects them and I don't think they have even opened it yet.
5,Great Season!,Loved Season 4. You learn a lot of unanswered questions about Jax and his dad. Cant wait for Season 5. Purchasing the season on Amazon was very easy and convenient.
2,They should have stopped this on season 3,"This season 4 is trash, horrible writing. Pathetic at best, season 4 becomes predictable. Characters are skewed to keep idiots watching, I'd be really interested to see who wrote seasons 4. GL End your SOA at 3. As it should have been."
4,SOA Season 4,It has an addictive story line and I would highly recommend this series to anyone interested in a fast paced crime drama.
5,Never a dull moment,"Awwww, it's refreshing to see real acting - not a reality show drama. SOA does a great job of keeping their audience on their toes. As much as we want the club to do right, it just wouldn't be as much fun to watch. Great job writers."
2,This season was less than optimum,"I think this season was a little too over the top - heads in the bag, head in the chile, and too cliched. Too many good characters were killed off, just to start a new story line - next season will probably be about dealing with the big mobster wanting revenge for his daughters death. And the new regime - Clay trying to take back his spot, Gemma reconciling that she isnt the big girl on the block, now Tara is. She is now just the ex presidents old lady - or she and clay will have to work it out - or stay broke up etc. Some of it was a bit too much and too bloody. I must say this season was less than optimum in my book and I have been watching for a long time now."
5,I love this show.,I love this show. Not only is Jax eye candy but the plot is amazing and keeps you wanting more.
5,Love the show!,Got the first few seasons free thanks to my prime membership. Like the show so much that I had to buy the next season. I cant wait for the new season to come out on streaming. Cons: Might be cheaper to find a box set and just watch via dvd.
1,An Utter Waste of Time and Money,"Just what we needed--another book that tells us how sick and twisted BDSMers are. And this from a supposedly sex-positive writer! The author's basic premise is ""whatever I like is sexy; if I'm not into it, it's just gross."" Luckily, not everyone is as close-minded as this woman. Feh."
5,The Final Word in How To Self-Publish,"The Self-Publishing Manual is THE book, as far as I am concerned, for anyone who wants to make a success of being published, all on their own. It is, as my heading states, the ultimate final word, the writer's golden fork, so to speak, for turning over jewels of wisdom often missing entirely in other ""how to"" books for authors.This year I have successfully published my tenth book, thanks to the advice I've collected over the years from Dan Poynter. Between his books and his newsletters, I can include two best sellers in my writing credits.Thank you, Dan!"
5,THE best book you could EVER get on self-publishing!,"GET THIS! I've written nine books and helped over 200 people write, publish and promote their own books. In every case, this book is the bible for how to ge tthrough the process alive---and turn a profit to boot. I can't say enough good things about this classic, time-tested, well researched and always up-dated amazing book. Just get it! -- Joe Vitale, author of way too many books to list here"
3,Reference Book,I was not able to read this whole book its too big. But I have been using it as a reference. I prefer Aaron Shepard's book better but this one does compliments his as a reference and it has more details.
3,Buy One Edition Only!,"As good as this book is, and believe me, it is good, and will educate you on everything you need to know about writing, producing and marketing your book; however, and that's a bigHOWEVER - don't waste your money on so called ""new editions"".I have the 13th Edition and recently wasted my money on thethis one.It seems the author has found a magic way to continually resell his original book by including a few new updates here and there,of no basic importance, changing the cover, along with larger print.I highly recommend ""The Complete Guide to Self Publishing"" by Tom and Marilyn Ross, an excellent companion to the ""Self Publishing Manual"", which includes important subjects and comments not covered in Dan Poynter's books. Between these two books, you're covered. (no pun intended)."
2,Not Helpful,"This book is called a ""manual"" for self-publishing.It isn't.Lots of pages, but it never tells you how to take your manuscript and publish it yourself, from start to finish.I started with this book, because of its title, its hype, and the reviews. But the books that actually HELPED me figure out HOW to self publish, were ones that I had to find elsewhere. The few actually useful books on this subject are not as slick and glossy or well promoted as Poynter's, but they have real step-by-step INFORMATION that will help you on your way.I'd ""pass"" on this one."
5,Very helpful book,"As the owner of a small publishing company, I found this book to be very helpful. A great resource."
4,"Flawed, but still an invaluable resource","The bottom line: This book offers an amazing wealth of information despite its many flaws, which include a reprehensible number of punctuation errors, an atrocious and difficult-to-read design, and a few organizational issues. Like many reviewers have said, much of the information in the book is outdated; I can hardly imagine writing my book on sheets of paper and spreading them on the floor to organize them in piles. The Self-Publishing Manual also fails to cover options for publishing and promoting online in any depth.All that said, I'd buy it again in a heartbeat."
4,Will Create Foundation But Oversimplifies,"I've personally spoken with Poynter, and it's clear he knows his stuff. We talked about his ""binder system,"" and how to take advantage of digital tools to market and promote your book.With that said, this book is a little outdated, and he makes the whole process sound much simpler than it really is.You'll think, ""Oh, I'll just start collecting information, put it into order, then I'll be ready to publish!""It's not that easy, and Poynter makes it sound like if you read this book, it will be.Don't buy into the magic bullet nature of the book. It's helpful, and it offers some nuggets of wisdom. But be ready to keep working, writing, and learning more about the self-publishing business - especially the way the Internet is changing the game."
5,Dan Poynter's Self-Publishing Manual,"This is THE book to walk you through the process of self-publishing. Yes, it is pointed towards non-fiction, however, with a little adjustment the valuable information works for publishing fiction just as well.With my dog eared copy (I did the dog ears) I have two publishing companies, Arrow Head Book Co. I use for Historical non-fiction and Fleur-de-Lys Book Publishing I use for fiction and I began a website for my trashy novels, www.atrashynovel.comNeedless to say this book was not only helpful in navagating the publishing world it was inspiring.Thanks Dan Poynter."
5,This is the best self-publishing manual on the planet!!!,Dan Poynter's self-publishing manual is an invaluable asset to any writer/self-publisher who wants to be taken seriously in today's incredibly competitive publishing market.I found Chapter Seven: Promoting your book particularly helpful. Dan gave me many useful ideas on how to get my book out there and how to get FREE publicity-something that ALL authors should know how to do.His resource section is filled with contacts and information that you would have to spend hours scouring the Internet to find. Dan lists it all in a very comprehensive way that makes all the information easily accessible.
3,Great stories,"The wording is difficult to read aloud to a young child, but the stories are fun and my two year old enjoys them. She really likes the artwork in the book."
3,Been there before...,"Having survived divorce with 2 young daughters myself, it was interesting to hear the childrens thoughts on their parents and their divorce. Sometimes the way we adults remember things are not quite the same as what our children remember and it was nice to see that the writer included the letters from his daughters even when their memories cast some shadows on his own perspective."
5,I almost didn't.....,"I almost did not buy the DC14 Full Kit after reading some of the reviews. But, I did. It was easy for me to put together. (Some said it was difficult.) It only makes the terrible noise some talk about when I hit something that I should not vacuum: metal key ring, attached rug strand. So, watch where you vacuum, as we should anyway. It is picking up everything I would expect it to. The wand...it is long, but it is not complicated. It is not that hard to work with. I am very happy with my purchase, especially at the low price I paid.As far as Amazon- I ordered the DC07, the next day saw the DC14 at a lower price, called Amazon and said I wanted to order it. They said fine. I received the DC07 in two days. I received my DC14 in two days. Fed Ex picked up the other both in the same day. The whole process took 4 days. The process was very smooth."
4,It would have been cheaper to buy this and skip all the other floor products,"Over the years I have bought vacuums, electric brooms, dustbusters, The Kone, electric mops...all in an effort to get spotless floors. I got the top rated vac by Consumer Reports. I should have saved my money, and bought the 'expensive' Dyson. This Dyson costs less than all the useless products and vacs and it DOES THE JOB. All of the accesories are easy, and it was a breeze to snap the few bits together, making it easy right out of the box. NOTHING is better, faster, or easier on bare floors."
3,What 's more do you want? 5 stars not 3,"This Dyson is going to be an addition to my five other vacs. The Dyson can do all the tricks that the other four can except the Roomba. The Roomba can run by itself without having you to get involved, but it will only do some light duty floor and carpet cleaning.My only complaint on the Dyson is the absences of a headlight on the unit. Otherwise, the Dyson is very powerful in suction, quieter and lighter than some other upright and canister vac that I own. It had the longest hose to reach those hard to reach area like the top of your bookself, the interior of your car or suck those spider webs off your high ceiling. By using the mini turbine head along with the long hose make the stairs cleaning job easier too."
5,zebco pro staff spincast reel,"I AM A BASS FISHING GUIDE FOR HALLIBURTON AND USE A ZEBCO PRO STAFF FISHING REEL DAILY BECAUSE IT IS DEPENDABLE AND SIMPLE TO USE FROM THE BEGINNER TO THE PRO FISHERMAN. THE BALL BEARINGS AND STAR DRAG MAKES IT A PERFECT REEL TO FIGHT BIG BASS WITHOUT FEAR OF BREAKING THE LINE. I HAVE CAUGHT BASS UP TO 10 3/4 POUNDS WITH THIS ZEBCO REEL AND WE USE IT FOR THE GUESTS BECAUSE IT IS BACKLASH FREE. A FEW THROWS AND THEY ARE CASTING LIKE OLD PROS. FOR SIMPLECITY DEPENDABILITY AND A FUN TIME FISHING ZEBCO PRO SPINCAST REEL, IS THE REEL TO BUY."
1,Wouldn't even hold a 7' tree!,"This stand claims to be rated for 10' trees, but I don't see how unless your tree is extremely straight and skinny. I have a 7' fat tree that has fallen over twice. The first time it fell I thought it was because I didn't balance the tree right or tighten the screws enough. After the second time it fell I realized that the plastic itself was flexing and allowing the tree to shift. This coupled with the fact that the base on this tree stand is way too narrow makes for a bad stand.Do not buy this product if you have a fat tree (I posted a picture of my tree in customer images if you want to see my fat tree before it fell) unless, of course, you like cleaning up a mixture of tree dirt, water, broken ornaments, and cellophane icicles."
4,Great deal!,"I'd give this five stars except that the vacuum we received and the user manual that came with it were slightly different models. No biggie, except the manual made it look like the handle was on backwards when we put it together and that made the assembly process take forever! But once we got it going we loved it. Great price for a great vacuum!"
4,"Works pretty good, so far no problems....","We just purchased the reconditioned Dyson DC 14 and so far it works pretty well:1. The noise level is a solid ""ok"".2. The suction is decent.3. It has a built-in rotating spiral brush that automatically brushes the rug when the vacuum is turned on. You have the option to turn it off when you have to clean hard wood floors.4. It has no bag filter which is a plus. The collected dirt can be easily removed from the container with one press of a button.5.You do have the option to clean the stairs with a very flexible attached cleaning hose that can be extended.6. Unfortunately the reconditioned version comes only with a 6 month limited warranty.7. It is a bit bulky but that is forgiveable.8. The weight of the vacuum could be lighter.9. The price is reasonable I assume compared to the original retail price of approx. $550.Overall out of a 5 star rating I would rate the DC14 (reconditioned) towards a 4."
3,Not thrilled,"This vacuum works well, but one part of it, the wandcap was broken upon delivery and the brush attachment does'nt fit."
1,Do not buy this vacuum!,"Great marketing - horrible product.The entire unit is clearly made as inexpensive as possible. Cheap plastic, very poor design - you actually push down with your foot to release the base from the handle. No suction. And I mean - NO SUCTION!I returned the unit in less than 1hr.Buy a Hoover. Good luck."
1,dyson spelled g-a-r-b-a-g-e,"biggest pile ive ever bought, with nonexistent customer service they should go out of business. bad service with a bad product = dont buy"
2,Not as helpful as I hoped,"This book does have lots of new races. But when you start to really take a look at them, they start to seem very similar to one another. I run a 3rd Edition D&D game and play in both d20 StarWars and D&D. I thought I would use this as a resource to create interesting new PCs and NPCs. But I have found that I barely open the book since I purchased it. Very disappointing."
4,Bigger than previous buddy bowl,"I have a water kitty. One that splashes her water all over and if given the opportunity will actually flip the bowl over (because that is more fun). I found a buddy bowl at a thrift store and fell immediately in love with this product. No more wet floors, walls, or wet food. But, the area I live in has extremely ""hard water"" and left my buddy bowl with hard water stains despite daily cleaning. It was time for a new bowl. I was thrilled to find the buddy bowl on Amazon and purchased two! But when they got here... they were huge. Seeming almost double the size. I ended up donating them to the dogs at a local animal shelter and they were thrilled. But I'm back to the splashes of water throughout my kitchen. Where oh where did the small buddy bowl go?"
1,Extremely poor quality,Horrible quality. Would never recommend buying this product.Serioudly don't invest your money on this.You'll hate it. It's not thick at all so if the baby were to fall in the crib it wouldn't protect them etc
2,but what is she saying?,"Cynthia has almost the ultimate ethereal voice. Her voice makes wish to explode with joy and laugh at the same time. I just have this haunting fear that she is singing the most evil BS. That her lyrics worship the nazi god and that she is condemning the underappreciated practice of abortion. I don't need the christian right (or its close hippy surrogates) in my life. Listening to her reminds of the first time I walked into a vegetarian restaurant and realized how disguistingly middle class it was. The food was to be worshipped, but the atmosphere sucked."
2,Disappointed,I was extremely disappointed in this item. For a cake plate it is very small. I expected more for the brand and price.
3,Does an ok job,"The flea trap seems ok. Got it after a month of fighting fleas with every other method, including sprays, bombs, shampoo, daily combing, spot-on treatments, etc. So over the past month it's gotten 4 fleas...but may be because that's all that is really left.4 fleas in the trap is 4 fleas not in my carpet or on my cats..."
1,Useless,I have had this in an area that has fleas as they jump on both my dog and me. This trap has been placed in this area for 4 days now and has not trapped a single flea.It seems to be able to trap about anything else except what it is supposed to do. In one word it is......USELESS.
1,Sorry I bought two!,"I have had approximately 15 fleas in one trap and about 10 in the other. I have put the traps in various places under the couch,under everything and that was my total. I also bought two plus extra pads. I would like my money back! I killed more fleas than the traps."
4,Flea light,"My flea control is two fold. First I have the exterminator come and spray, but not with the heavy stuff. I don't want to have to remove my cat. She is old and spoiled. He uses something that is lighter. Then the flea lights do the rest. The fleas want some place to go, I guess. Fleas controlled. I find the lights are not enough alone, but this apporach does the trick."
5,Covered with fleas,"I recommend this flea trap without hesitation, if a direct application of Frontline is not possible. We have three wild cats living in my father-in-law's basement. When we started noticing the cats scratching, we put three of these flea traps by their food and water. The traps are covered with fleas stuck to the pad. I just ordered 4 more traps. My nephew has a cat that is very allergic, and he is afraid to use Frontline. I have given him a trap, also.If you can't use Frontline for your pets, by all means use this flea trap!"
1,Hoax,Device placed next to dog's bed for one week; did not catch any fleas whatsoever. Conclude this item is a hoax.
1,Didn't work at all.,"Was so hopeful that this would work. Flea issue when we moved to a new house was horrendous, we have three dogs, none of which had ever had fleas before. They were in the carpet, because I was vacuuming them up constantly, we bombed the house, and still had problems (dogs were on Comfortis AND Tri-Shield). Finally after shampooing the rugs, and having an exterminator come out, the fleas are gone.I ran the Flea Trap right next to the dogs beds, and never caught one flea...in over a month! Kept it running for another month, just to see if there were any stragglers. Never caught anything at all, not even a mosquito, which come into the house year round in the south.Very disappointed...would send it back if I could!"
4,It works!!!,"In the space of about two weeks, the sticky pad was completely filled with fleas. If you have a real infestation problem and buy this product, be sure to get extra pads. They fill up fast! We only bought one, but for the size of our house we really should have gotten at least two."
4,great product,A little expensive but definiting worth it. No more trouble finding space for all those other plastic containers I do recommend this product
1,"Hate this book, not one of her best at all.","My daughter, who just loves books and always has, thankfully finds this as boring as I do. We have given it away finally as it was just taking up valued book shelf space. The pictures aren't nearly as engaging as some of Sandra Boynton's other work, and the worst part is the rhyme. It doesn't flow nicely at all. It seems this was written and illustrated in a day."
5,Bedtime Rhythms,"All of Sandra Boynton's children's books are charmingly illustrated and very enjoyable to read. This book, PAJAMA TIME is written in such a way that you can make it sound all the more humorous to young children by establishing a rhythmic delivery that will make the child giggle & want to join in the fun. My 3 year old granddaughter loves to hear this book and asks for it over & over. It's the perfect short story before bedtime, although usually I find that when you read a child one Sandra Boynton book she is going to want to hear another & another; they're just that much fun!"
3,A little Disappointing (but still worth a read if you like historical fictions),"After reading some of barbara erskine's other books, I must admit I was a little disappointed with this one. It spanned over so many years and it just seemed a little disjointed and led me to lose that feeling of wanting to know what will happen - about a half way through I didn't really care what would happen. I also just found the ghost sex a bit too ridiculous which ruined my view of the story.However, it is still pleasant enough to read, I guess I am just comparing it to kingdom of shadows which I looooovvvvveddd."
4,"Good for the price, but do not use if you want a professional instrument","I purchased this harp because I was a college student who wanted to take up a new instrument. I didn't want a small lap harp(not enough octaves) and I couldn't afford a harp any bigger.This harm is first, and foremost, beautiful. I bought mine with vines running up along the side and I couldn't be happier with how it looked...It plays just fine, but the sound is a little plucky. This is expected, as its not an expensive harp and it is a folk harp. If you want a very smooth playing harp you should not get this, but if you are ok sacrificing a bit of sound quality for more octaves (as I was) than you will be pleased with this harp."
3,Faucet,"I think it looks nice, but I wasn't expecting the sprayer to be made out of plastic, especially since the price was a little steep in the first place. Also there was a dent in the faucet when I got it. It's not too noticeable, but when I'm paying quite a bit of money I do kind of expect it to be in mint condition. Needless to say I wasn't all too happy with my purchase. I do like the look of the Faucet, but would never pay that much again unless it was really good quality."
2,Not necessary for good vocal mics,"I got this preamp because I heard I needed a preamp as well as phantom power for an AKG studio condenser mic that I was also purchasing; and that it would also ""warm up"" the sound a bit. That might help for cheap mics but there was absolutely no voice quality difference with 2 mid-range mics under diff recording tests than straight to an Mbox 2 mini. As a matter of fact, I got a little extra noise. (but that is prob due to the extra cable connection) I can't say what it will do for instruments, but for voice, it is totally not necessary if you have a good mic and interface. If not, then you probably need something like this.Things I liked: Solid metal build, 2 kinds of jacks, price.Things I hated: Gets very hot doing nothing, No on/off switch (you have to unplug it from the back each time)Although this preamp may work just swell, those last 2 hated points were enough for me to give it 2 stars."
4,Pleasant psych and prog blend,"I'd loved this CD, but I expected a heavier sound (the cover promises it). For my delight, I've found gems of pop psychedelia: ""Rainchild"" is my favourite, but ""Summer"", ""Thief"", ""Tide"" and ""Laugh at the Poor Man"" are pretty good too. Only ""Council Plans"" and ""The Queen and the Pauper"" aren't so good as the rest. But it worths the money, surely."
4,One of the good ones,"The Oz books divide into good (WIZARD, GLINDA, WISHING HORSE), bad (LOST KING, GIANT HORSE, LUCKY BUCKY), and intermediate (EMERALD CITY, COWARDLY LION, PIRATES). This is a good one, with vivid narration and a meaningful plot. The authors deftly manage three story lines involving a total of nine (!) wandering adventurers: American, long-standing, and new native-Ozian protagonists. The old characters are true to earlier depictions and the new ones are all reasonably ""Ozzy"" (although the title character is whiney, more of a drip even than Jack Pumpkinhead in LAND.)But MERRY-GO-ROUND is also different: It's uniquely moralistic. Even GLINDA, which begins and ends with ""Duty"", isn't as preachy as this one. This is preachy like Oscar Wilde, in the end about guilt and redemption, subjects which most of the Oz books mercifully avoid. (Merely having the good guys forgive the bad guys in the end does not mean a book is about guilt and redemption. MGR is REALLY about guilt and redemption.)"
3,Uninspired Production of Terrific Group,"Given the accolades from the other reviewers here, I feel compelled to air my beef with this set. Stated simply, it's limited to the work Sounds Incorporated did with EMI producer John Burgess. Burgess had no clue how to produce this group; the sound is dull and the material selected is not particularly inspiring either if you except ""Hall of the Mountain King,"" ""Mogambo"" and ""Emily.""But this band was a great instrumentals group. What is missing here is their terrific recordings produced by Joe Meek and also the ones they did for British Decca in 1962. Every one of those omitted sides (about 12 in all) puts the material on this collection to shame."
5,The book every geographer should have.,"""All Possible Worlds"" is an excellent source for the history of geography. The authors cover geography as done by the ancient Greeks, Phoenicians, Muslims, Chinese, Medieval scholars. Portuguese, and all the explorers during the Age of Exploration. They excellent cover how hard it was to discard the wrong ideas of the Greeks. After discussing Humboldt, they then go into the development of geography from 1850 to the present day, which to them was originally in the 1970's, although it has been updated up to 1993. in each of the major countries on the Earth.A definite book for any true geographer to have."
3,Not Impressive As His Later Works....,"This was an ok CD. Period. To be honest, I only liked about 3 of the 7 or 8 tracks on the album, but they were good enough to warrant at least a 3 star rating. If your used to Zimmer's later works like I am, then this one probably wont find itself among your favorites, but if your a lover of his work, then give it a shot."
3,Thought Provoking,"Ms Shreve offers us a naked look at the range of emotions that are elicited from Kathryn Lyons, the wife of Jack, a commercial airline pilot who has just died in a crash in transit over the Irish Sea. We feel Kathyrn's shock, her pain. We move into her memories easily through the conduit of Ms Shreve's simple fluid language and sense her growing, albeit bewildered anger as she realizes that the man she was married to was more a stranger than the man she built her life around for more than a decade.I will not spoil the story for anyone, but I will recommend it. I ask that as Ms Shreve enjoys setting her tales in the same New England location and tying them together with the mention of characters from her other novels, that she consider writing a sequel to this one, where the main character is Maddie, Jack and Kathyrn's daughter and the plot revolves around her eventual awareness and subsequent meeting of Deidre and Dermot."
2,Oh So Predictable!,"I was told that there was a surprising twist, I never found it, Very predictable, no twist. I would not recommend it."
2,THE PILOT'S WIFE,The first few pages hooked me in and I continued to read only to be disappointed. To have no inkling of what her husband was truly like made me angry at the character Kathryn.I just can't get over this enough to recommend this story to anyone . I had figured out his secret before she did. The fact that I solved the big mystery on my own made my enjoyment of this book minimal. Too bad because it started out great and then just frizzled.
1,Couldn't finish it,"I NEVER walk out of a movie, no matter how bad. The optimist in me says that it has to get better, and besides, it's always paid for. I used to be able to say the same thing about books. No longer. I started this book, put it down after quite a few chapters. Three months later, it's still lying on my floor. This book doesn't even deserve a star. Boo Oprah! Bad choice!"
2,not up to Oprah book club standards,"This seems like the kind of paperback you buy at the supermarket or newsstand when you have nothing to read and don't expect much from a book. While the theme of no one really knowing anyone else, even the person he or she is married to, is a fascinating one, this book didn't explore it in an interesting or provocative way. If well-written, a book that explores this theme should have us examining all of our intimate relationships and wondering if we do, indeed, know our loved ones as well as we thought. Instead, this book leaves us thinking that 'the pilot's wife' isn't very observant nor insightful about her marriage. Also, the terrorist angle seems contrived and simply a way to make the book more 'topical,' or more 'relevant.'"
1,zzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzz,Would have been a great short in woman's magazine. Don't waste your time or money...
2,Oprah's Book Club.... REALLY!?!?!?,"This book was... eh?I guess typical? I feel that it started off strong and could relate to the characters and their emotions. But, the novel became way too far-fetched after she went to England. (I don't want to say what happens becuase it will ruin it for you.)It turned out to be a dramatic, ""life-time"" movieish novel.It was good but not a ""must-read."""
2,A QUICK BUT SHALLOW READ,"As both an avid reader and a reader of most of the Oprah Bookclub selections this one was diappointing. Although it WAS a quick read, the characters had NO depth to them and the ending was just plain ridiculous. It reminded me more of a Danielle Steele-type book. The storyline line IS an interesting one, it's just too bad the author didn't develop it more. Will be watching for next months bookclub pick....."
4,"great, quick read!!",I have read several of Oprah's picks and feel this one is worthy of being on her list. I read fast and this is one of the few books that I read every word. Is a quick read but have been thinking about it at odd times since I put it down. Will definitely look into others books but this author.
2,Weak weak writing!,"What was all the hype about? This was a terribly dissapointing shallow novel that did not deserve the success it received thanks to Oprah's show.It was predictable, lacking in compelling detail, contrived and at many times, boring.Don't waste your time or money!"
2,DEPRESSING,"I found this book to be terribly depressing. The writing was good but the book went on and on about what a wife experiences when she loses her husband. I was able to feel what Kathryn was going through emotionally, but I felt half-sick the entire time I read about her grief. Perhaps her loss scared me, but I did not enjoy the depression that I shared with her while I read the book."
2,Too predictable and dull,"This was my first time reading a book written by Shreve and if the rest of her books are like this I don't think I will be too interested in reading more. It did not leave much to the imagination. I agree with another reader--overly descriptive. Too early into the book, we all knew that there was someone else. The ending did not leave me wanting more, instead I felt relieved to be finished."
2,A subject that was treated many times,"I found myself bored many times. The author goes into lengthy details of clothing worn by characters to fill in material. Also, the matter was treated humorously in the movie, the Captain's Paradise many years ago. Would not recommend."
2,predictable and unbelievable.,Move over soap operas. I finished this book only because I was on vacation with nothing much to do and nothing much else to read. It transferred no feeling to me. Flat and uninteresting. The characters were not very believable or interesting. Sorry Oprah!!
1,"Terrible, transparent story","I am writing this review simply in hopes of bringing the average customer rating of 3 stars down to where it should be! This book was transparent start to finish, (of course she gets the man...) mildly intriguing attempt to tell a story of the husband's strange other life, but not nearly enough information about WHY he would chose to do that. After this one I am leary of trying any other from this Author."
3,Good Story that is fatally flawed.,"When the movie rights are bought -- and I am sure they will be -- and the script writer sits down to write the screenplay, he or she will come across an error, an oversight, so glaring that s/he will wonder how this was passed over by the author and her publisher. A shocking oversight. I am astonished that none of the reviews mention this sloppy oversight. An oversight that leaves the reader feeling completely cheated. As will filmgoers when this highly commericial book is made into a movie."
4,Could Not Put This Book Down!,"As a mother of a 2 yr. old, I have very little time to read, something I love to do. But this book caught my interest from page one and I couldn't stop until the end. It's been over two weeks since I finished the book and I still can't stop thinking about it. A little predictable but there were still a few surprising twists. If you're looking for a good, quick read, this is the book. I'm on my way to order more books by this author!"
1,No-brainer!,"NY Times best seller?! Recommended by Oprah?! What did I miss?! I found this book to be (at best) dull, unimaginative, predictable and anti-climatic."
2,Don't bother - you've probably already figured it out.,"The plot of this book was EXACTLY what I thought it would be. The author surprised me once, near the end, and by then I didn't care - I just wanted the book to be over. This is just as predictable as the cheesy tv movie it will probably become. Save your money."
3,A good read before bed,"I enjoyed the writing style of the author and would not hesitate to pick up another of her books. Overall I felt the plot was good but as a previous reviewer stated, I don't think the political aspect needed to be added to the storyline. I feel if that had been omitted than I would have enjoyed the book more."
2,This book is tedious!,I read this book in a couple of sittings only because half of the book tediously explained the first day! I wanted to get to the substance of the book & it never came. I agree with the critics - it was flat.
4,Well worth making the time to read,"I have to say what a great story! I have read other ""Oprah"" books, and this one is one is by far the best. I am a single mom and I have to make time to read (sacrifice sleep normally). The author incorporates the tragedy bestowed on a pilot's wife and the subsiquent revelations that she makes in trying to clear her husband's name. The way we are taken from the present to the past and back is so well transitioned. The characters are ""real"" and they could be your next door neighbor. The fact that is easy to follow makes it that much more appealing for those of us that have to keep putting it down (not by choice). I have given it to three friends already and they have all loved it. We have started a circle of books by Shreve. My hat's off to the author!"
1,Same Old Story,The outcome of the plot was predictable and I found that I cared little for all of the characters. You were not able to enjoy and of the twists or emotions because I didn't care what happended to any of them.
2,"Fly away, please Anita.","I'm not quite sure of what I have just read. How could such a seemingly intelligent man (who gets away with having two separate families) die in such an ignorant manner. Maybe he shouldn't have packed so heavily. And wifey-pooh, what's up with you? Are you just stupid, or blind too? Man, this book was a chore getting through. I'm glad I'm over with it."
3,The ending...*sigh*,"A decent enough read, but I cannot agree more with everyone else here who complained about the ending of the book. What a waste of a good story! It's as if the author tired of writing and ran to the shelf to pull down the closest at-hand ending...and, there you have it! Everything tied up neatly with a bow on top...regardless of the relevance to the story."
3,A true to life narration of going through mourning,"The Pilot's Wife began as an enthusiastic attempt at putting together a character in mourning. At times suspenseful, and at other times predictable. The writing was average."
4,The Pilot's Wife,"This book was a very thoughtful exploration of whether or how well one person can know another, as seen through the eyes of a wife who has been deceived. Well written and with carefully drawn characters, it was especially appropriate for our book club and generated a very lively discussion."
5,Pilots wife,"EXCELLENT ! I could not put it down. What an absolute great book. I passed it along to everyone in my family-they all give this book a five star rating! I love Anita Shreve I think she is a fabulous writer-easy to read ,easy to follow, excellent stories!"
2,I wish I would have read these reviews before reading it.,I found this book .. boring .. I managed to get through it .. and was very disappointed in the end. It was hard keeping my interest .. and I was curious about the end .. because I thought something more was going to happen. I would not recommend this book to anyone.
1,Depressing from a woman's viewpoint,"Oprah supposedly said that if you read this book, you'll never trust men again. She's right! But I found this book compelling reading; I finished it in one day. However I was disappointed in the viewpoint that women are always victimized by men and by the stereotyping of airline pilots. The book just left a bad taste in my mouth."
2,I really WANTED to like this book...,"but I just couldn't. It was just so, so predictable! In addition, the heroine is a driveling idiot. She is a strong woman and a good mother, but when it came to 'the secret', NO ONE is so dense that they couldn't figure it out. The fact is: a woman knows if something is awry in the marriage. She always knows.By the way, my book seemed to be missing the last page. What's up with that? How very disappointing!"
1,Watch out for the movie,"This was the most incredibly shallow book that I have read in some time. Not only did it read with all the poetry that a screenplay provides, but it was not even an interesting screenplay, being both predictable and wide of the mark in terms of the reactions and relations between characters. It is always a shame when an author pitches their work so obviously to Hollywood- and Hollywood doesn't make very many interesting movies."
3,I need some help here.,"I must admit that I enjoyed the book. It was not the best I ever read but I did stay up all night reading it. My job requires me to read mostly historical fact and this was a fun escape that I don't indulge in very often. But...what is up with the ending. Did anyone get it? Who was she calling, the apartment of the other wife and why? I would appreciate an answer from someone. I feel like a no brainer but maybe I am just too logical to get what happened in the end."
4,Surprise!,When I started reading this book I did not enjoy Anita Shreve's writing style and thought it would be a tear-jerker about a woman dealing with death. So I flipped to the middle and read just one more paragraph (I thought) before returning it to its owner. But then I got all caught up in the fabulous story and intriguing plot & characters. I returned to the front of the book and read it all the way through in one night. A fun read that caught me up!
2,Thud! A big fat bore,"Okay, so there's sensationalism in airline disasters. That's probably the biggest reason I stuck with this slow and useless novel. The plot and resolution weren't even mildly believable.How Oprah could pick this is beyond me . . . while I don't always like her selections, at least they're (usually) literary and thought provoking."
5,I have never read a book so fast!,"Once you open the cover there is no turning back. Shreve holds you until the very end, never letting you down.I completely ignored everything to finish this book it was so good. I would recommend it to anyone. I have never read a book so fast."
2,This is the last time I read an Oprah endorsed book,"I feel that the few books that I have read endorsed by Oprah have all been the same; women as victims, while I feel it's great she is endorsing reading for the masses, we need books of more substance.This felt like a screenplay for a television movie of the week. I didn't care about the characters as they were so thinly developed. Typical of this genre of novels, she is duped by the man in her life and left to fend for herself - and ultimately, it doesnt feel like she triumphs at all. The details were so messy and implausible, I found it rather aggrevating. Never have I seen in the news the family of the pilot of a commercial airline exposed like a celebrity - can you name me one? I read it - but I also eat potato chips and eat ice cream once and a while - the prognosis for this book is; it's full of air and has no nutritional value but won't hurt you if you limit your intake of things like this!"
5,What a glorious book!,"What a wonderfully written story! I could feel the heart of each and every one of the characters. The ending was a tad bit empty but I don't care, I loved every page I read along the way. I really liked how the writer took you back in time and then came back to present day, an interesting style. Ladies esp., don't miss reading this book!"
5,KEEPS YOU ON THE EDGE OF YOUR SEAT!!,THE PILOT'S WIFE IF A GREAT BOOK. I DID'T WANT TO PUT IT DOWN. THE AUTHOR'S DETAILED WRITINGS HELPED TO HAVE A VISUAL OF THE WHOLE BOOK IN YOUR MIND.I CAN'T WAIT TO READ HER NEXT BOOK!!!!!
3,well written but irritating,i felt myself sick to learn of the death but worst to find out about the other woman. she was convinced that she had a good marriage and had no idea what her life was really like. it made me feel betrayed. i enjoyed the book but was a little disturbed by the truth of it all. you cant help to think your life or anyones could be that way. it definately makes you stop and think. i would have liked a better ending. i am not sure whether robert and her got together or not.\
1,A Real Chick Book,"A commercial airliner mysteriously blows up off the coast of Ireland. The doomed pilot's wife, Kathryn, discovers that Jack has a 'wife'(Muire) in Britain and has fathered two young children through their union. Although Jack never goes to church with Kathryn, with Muire he's a dedicated, church-going Roman Catholic. So far, so good. What I cannot accept and find absolutely preposterous is that a commercial pilot would merely pick up a bag to take on his aircraft without first inspecting the contents. That Kathryn's new love interest, Robert, is part of the investigation is also a stretch. But, this is a chick book and doesn't require any deep thinking."
1,"Skip it - from a ""real pilot's"" wife","I'm a wife of a pilot and I was personally offended by how ""we"" were portrayed. I doubt that any pilot's spouse would be so naive. I know where my husband is every minute of the day and believe me, I would know if he was leading a double life. It would be more plausible for the pilot's spouse to have a double life. I read the entire book hoping it would get better...don't make the same mistake that I did."
4,A step-above the mass market read,"This book is the best of both worlds -- it's easy-to-read without being shallow, and carries the nuance of literature without any of the ponderous prose or depressing themes. You can read it in the doctor's office and be entertained, but not embarrased as others scope out your taste in books. In truth, it's not destined to be a classic, but who really cares? The story is simply told and has an element of ""Lifetime"" television in the theme of an innocent woman wronged; the story might have had more depth if she were a little less of a paragon. But in the end, I just gave over to it and enjoyed myself."
2,Silly,"If you want to read a good novel about a pilot and his women try ""the triumph & the glory"", or even that old Hailey book, ""airport"". Shreve just concocts a bunch of silly melodrama here"
2,What happened?,"After having read such wonderful books like ""The Rapture of Canaan"" and ""I Know This Much Is True"" where on earth did this book come from? I was intrigued by the story line, but this book fell flat. The characters were one-dimensional and the writing...I was bored and disappointed."
2,Good Thing I Borrowed It,"When I started this I thought it would be a good read because I was attracted to the writing style. But the writing style alone does not make a book. There was a sense of emotional detachment and underdeveloped characters. I thought Jack's secret life was more shocking than it actually was. And Kathryn's relationship with her daughter was repaired too quickly in the end. They should have been affected much more by the secret life their husband and father was leading. Wouldn't they have needed therapy, or something? And Robert--what was the point of him? He and Kathryn seemed to be attracted to each other, but their relationship was so ambigious it was annoying. Save your money. The writing style is excellent, but there's nothing really enlightening here."
3,A No Brainer,"The reviews in the front of the book are correct when they say it is a quick read, and it is somewhat absorbing, but it is also one-dimensional and fanciful. This is not a literary book that will make the reader think, or question any reality they might have. It will not make you laugh or cry or stir deep-seated emotions. It is a book for the beach, or a rainy Saturday when you want to give your mind a break. You will not need it for this one."
3,A good read,"although a bit predictable. Still, I was pulled into the story right away and couldn't put it down - I had to see how it ended. An enjoyable way to spend an evening!"
1,Felt compelled to vote and bring down the book's average,"Reading the back cover of this book, I thought it would be exciting. I kept waiting for the descriptions of grief and emotion to stop so that the Tom Clancey intrigue could begin. What a disappointment. Find another book to read."
2,An unfortunate waste of good writing,"I've never read any of Shreve's other books, but have heard good reviews. The Pilot's Wife, however, is little more than an empty box wrapped in fancy paper. Shreve does a remarkable job portraying grief and its aftermath - but the book never moves beyond that. The first one hundred pages are beautifully written, almost moving, but do nothing to advance the plot. When the story finally does get underway, the reader is carried along on a thoroughly predictable, emotionally unsatisfying journey. In fact, the most shocking thing about the book is that it turns out exactly the way you expect it to with an ending that is very depressing, formulaic, and altogether stilted. It's a shame that a writer like Shreve, who clearly knows how to turn a nice phrase, had to write such an empty saga. I wouldn't hold it against her in the future: but I wish I'd chosen one of her other books to start with."
1,TRITE!,"The reader knows going in that Jack has a secret life, as does everyone but Kathryn. Exactly half way through the book, we are introduced to part of his other life, way too far into the book! I was much more interested in the other wife's story (IRA, smuggling, running away) than in the story of a bored teacher/wife who loses her husband in a horrible, tragic incident. If this had been submitted to me for a grade, it would've been given an F."
2,Disappointing ending.,"I thought this book was very descriptive, and although slow reading, it had me sucked in. That is. . . until the ending. It was not 'too predictable' as others have said. The ending was far too ludicrous to be predictable."
5,Heartbreaking,"Of all the books this particular author has published, ""The Pilot's Wife"" has been my favourite. A pilot's wife myself, found this book was not only suspensful, but heartbreaking. If your in for a good escape, pick up this book...I could hardly put it down."
3,Pleasant and Predictable,"Although I found this novel difficult to put down, I was dissapointed with its many predictable outcomes. Overall, the story was enjoyable, readable, but definately not 5 stars."
3,Didn't do anything for me...,"Kathryn finds herself a young widow with a teenage daughter after her husband is killed in a plane crash. Jack was piloting a plane that went down off the coast of Ireland. Before Kathryn and her daughter even have time to start their grieving process they are thrown into a deep investigation of what exactly made that plane go down and was Jack involved in something malicious. The story unfolds as Kathryn does some digging around of her own, however, what she finds if pretty predictable and the way Kathyn, a very dry personality, reacts does not create an exciting read.The plot has its merits but it's delivery is lacking. I need characters that I can feel for. People with charisma and character. Shreve needs to spend more time character building and less on unplausible plots. I give this one 3 stars."
2,a good book for the beach or an airplane trip,"Although this book is not the quality literature that I have come to expect of Oprah's picks, it was light and readable. I would recommend it for a lazy summer afternoon at the beach or for an airplane trip."
4,Can you really ever know another person?,"This novel points out, with an uncanny clarity, how it is entirely possible for your mate, or best friend, or relative, etc.to be living a separate existence from the one you share with them. I had an almost uncontrollable urge to give my mate the third degree about his every movement as I finished reading this startling exceptional novel."
4,Well written novel about relationships,"Imagine that you have what you've always wanted - a caring spouse, a good kid, a nice home, a beautiful town to live in. Then imagine that the entire world you've found for yourself comes crashing down, a piece at a time. This book does a wonderful job of exploring how one woman deals with loss, betrayal, and monumental life changes. The author writes well, and does an excellent job of making you care for the characters in the book. She begins by introducing us to this marriage, this relationship between two people. We then follow along with the woman as she discovers, piece by piece, the secrets that underlayed this relationship and life she had built around it. The novel uses beautiful prose to explore relationships, how those relationships change over time, and how people who share a home can sometimes not really know each other at all. A well written book, a quick read, and a nice insight into relationships and marriage."
2,disappointing,"considering it was an Oprah Book Club book, I was truly disappointed at the pace of the book."
1,"Three words: BORING, BORING, BORING","Oprah has made this socalled ""Mystery Thriller"" a bestseller. So much for Oprah's taste and judgment, I must wonder how big a cut she gets? Has she even read the book? As for reality who has ever seen a guy sit down, cross his legs and then put his hands in his pockets? What a waste of my time and money."
3,A Fatally flawed book.,"Although I was captured by the spare, fine writing of this novel, I was amazed to discover a flaw toward the end of the book -- a flaw so profound, so glaring, that I fail to understand how either the author or publisher allowed it. It's too bad that such a fine writer allowed this sloppy judgement in deciding to let it pass - for she surely must have been aware of it. A flaw that ultimately ruins the entire story."
1,Disappointed,"The plot of this book is somewhat unrealistic. I've often wondered about people who didn't realize there were marital problems until his/her spouse suddenly left one day. Shreve's descriptions of people and the location are well done. The story did keep my interest. I had to finish the book to find out what would happen next; I just didn't like the story line. I prefered the ""Weight of Water"" better than this book."
2,"fast read, but totally unbelievable","As a pilot's wife myself I found this book to be totally unbelievable from start to finish. No airline would treat the family the way this one was treated, no pilot would risk the lives of his passengers or his crew by carrying a bomb or anything close to it! I also found it very hard to believe that he could have two families and Kathryn wouldn't have found out - the whole story was totally bogus. I did, however, find it was a page-turner for at least the first half, a very easy read. Is Oprah really reading these books or not?"
4,pleasing,Good quick read....would have like to seen more develop between Katheryn and Robert but overall great read.
1,Typical Oprah Selection,"I should have known going into it that this book would have some sort of cliche man hating theme...Oprah liked it. And, as we all know, Oprah is a man hater, so she likes this book.If you are content with cheesy cliche storylines and boring character development, by all means get this book. If you appreciate good writing and unique and creative storylines, avoid this book."
3,Cruzer vs. NERO! Cruzer works great if....,"...you don't have NERO installed on your computer. I got my Cruzer and plugged it in to my daughter's laptop and was very impressed. I took it to work and plugged it in to a couple of computers there - impressed my co-workers. But then I plugged it in to my home computer and the computer froze up. Every time I plugged it in, my computer froze. I was getting ready to format my hard drive and re-install Windows (thinking darn Microsoft OS is corrupt again) when I came across a little FAQ on Sandisk's web site saying there was a known incompatiblity with NERO software. I have Nero installed - leading me to think this is the issue since the Cruzer works on all of the other computers I've tried it on. The FAQ said that an update would be released soon to patch this issue - that was a year ago and nothing yet. So, Cruzer will probably work great for you IF you don't have NERO installed."
3,Lanyard Removed From This Product,"Beware folks, Sandisk has removed the lanyard from this 2GB USB flash drive and others. It's kind of like selling a wristwatch without a band. If you call Sandisk customer service they will send you a lanyard without charge, so they say."
3,false info!,some things i thought i would let everyone know...this guide has false info! for example the Hermes has no aerial spectacle if you press L3 nothing happens! there is no hidden package#46 in bathroom stall Studio C and there is no Studio C!but overall it is a great guide... i just felt like complaining.
5,Better than expected.,"Came within 2 weeks as expected, a few minor creases and scuffs on front cover. Looks like usual wear, it looks like there is a printing error on only the upper right hand corner (a portrait of Tommy Vercetti, and the page number) where it is way to dark, but still legible.For $0.01 and $3.99 shipping you can't go wrong."
1,Sizing is for women? Children? Not men.,"I typically wear size 10.5-11.5 US Men's shoes. I have a fiberglass cast on my foot. The ""Medium-Large"" is at least three inches too short.Utterly useless.Now I've got the hassle of sending this thing back.If you're considering buying this thing beware.Seller: PRINT SOME DIMENSIONS ON THE PAGE!"
4,A comprehensive manual for pageant hopefuls,The Crowning Touch is a comprehensive manual for beauty pageant entrants. Everything from acing the interviews to projecting an attractive image in a swimsuit is covered. A must-read for all interested in entering such competitions.
5,Great Product,My sister suggested that I try this shower head and I am so happy that I did! The filters are very easy to replace and you don't need any tools to install it or take it apart.
3,"LOMBARDO ROCKS, AND HIS BOOK IS OKAY TOO","This book is good and clear cut. Pedagogically, Lombardo is no match for the likes of Peter Erskine, but if you like his particular style you should check it out. My only real qualm is the following, and it's a doozie: NO SLAYER EXAMPLES. This is probably for legal reasons, as Dave was not in Slayer at the time this book came out. But there's just no denying it - SLAYER EATS GRIP INC. FOR BREAKFAST. The book would be WAY better if Dave was in a position to discuss the amazing stuff he does on tracks like WAR ENSEMBLE, ANGEL OF DEATH, CHEMICAL WARFARE, etc. That's the stuff I really want to read about. In short - amazing drummer/okay book."
1,It was aweful!,"First of all the advertisment specifically said, two bobble barbies, 1 spongebob and 1 patrick! When my order arrived there was only the Spongebob Barbie! Amazon was great though because when I contacted them I was advised it was a third party sale and they could not control the merchandise, however Amazon refunded my money which was great! Unfortunatly the Barbie doll was broken in the box but oh well I wasn't out any money! Shame on the seller of these faulsley advertising items, Thank you Amazon for all of your help!!"
1,The most boring book,"Robert Clark has taken one of the most colorful culinary figures in history and turned him into the most boring 327 I've ever suffered through. His verbosity was annoying, and there were so many tangential wanderings that I could barely remember whom the book was about."
4,Very Good Guide for Plotting a Herb Garden,"This is a comprehensive, easy to understand guide which is highly useful if you are planning to start a herb garden. The book covers everything from herbal folk lore to soil composition to herbal garden designs. The only weakness I found was the really limited information on container gardening. This book will be on my reference shelf for years to come.Recommended, especially for those contemplating an actual garden of herbs."
1,Unhelpful,There were a ton of errors and the made-up questions did not seem all that similar to the real LSAT questions. I would recommend Princeton Review for Arguements and Arco for games.
2,Nice pixs,"A coffee-table version for the tabloid set. Sorted by topic, location, and proclivity, the pictures save it from being relegated to the grocery check-out line."
3,"Depending upon your age, this might help you.","""Spark Notes The Outsiders"" was not helpful in the sense of explaining symbolism and it only gave brief summary's of each chapter. Helpful for younger readers, but somewhat useless for older readers. As always, you should read the Spark Notes AFTER you have read ""The Outsiders."" Ages 10 to 13 - I recommend; ages 13 and up - I do not recommend."
2,Very disappointing,"I don't usually leave bad reviews but this book is just too hyped-up. I've had these books for about 10 year and never got to them until last week - what a disappointment. I have only read the first one so far but it's off to a really bad start. I don't like her writing style all that much, it seems clunky and cumbersome at times and the main character was not very likable. The plot's fine with a couple of good surprises but the end is a total cliffhanger - stopped right in the middle of a very important scene. I peeked ahead into the 2nd book and the scene is not res"
5,This one goes to the heart...,"Be warned. If you are a reader that prefers fast-food fantasy -- where everything is action-packed, color is delivered simply by creating a more outlandish 'species' than other writers have, and the characters' thoughts, motives and feelings are spelled out and defined for you -- then you will not like these books. McKillip does not insult her readers in that way. (Don't get me wrong, there is plenty of action, color, and character.) I have read this trilogy many times, and each time it grips me just as strongly, while it reveals something I hadn't noticed before. But it isn't the action that grips you. It's the quiet moments of doubt, vulnerability, and wondering. Moments when it seems that eternity is holding it's breath, waiting silently for it's fate to be read. Believe me, it's not as corny as I make it sound. Read the book (if you're an intelligent reader). The characters will become more real to you than many of the people you know."
3,Solid telephone!,We bought the unit about a month ago. Is is working better than many of the units that we had owned previously. The sound is excellent. It is easy to operate and you get two telephones for the price of one!
2,"Expected Hogan or Clarke, got a screenplay","James P. Hogan and Arthur C. Clarke have both written excellently of alien technologies discovered by humans. They are masters of moving a plot along, discovery by discovery, so that the reader enjoys uncovering the purpose and/or use of the alien technology as the book unfolds. Unfortunately, Coonts did not do this in Saucer. The book reads like a screenplay, as if it were written for immediate filming (Crichton suffers from this tendency too.). The characters are all stereotyped Saturday Serial fare, and the plot just isn't very sophisticated. I will take this one to the used bookstore."
1,Piece of GARBAGE,"Did Stephen Coonts, or Stephen Coonts' 10 year old grandson write this junk? I couldn't tell. Maybe Stephen Duntz wrote it!"
3,"Good News, Bad news","Yes, the plot is simplistic, and yes, the characters are cartoonish. The male hero is characterized as young, smart, and a big eater. The female hero is good looking, a pilot, and can kill. The antagonist is wealthy, nasty, and greedy. Give me a break! I expect much more of modern fiction. As a high-school student (way too long ago), I read and quite enjoyed Andre Norton's The Time Traders and Galactic Derelict and expected Saucer to build upon those novels and their subsequent updates. Silly me!The good news is that Saucer is an enjoyable read and quite a quick read. If you enjoy old space operas, you will most likely enjoy Saucer.Regarding my three-star rating of Saucer. [...]This is a good book within its genre, not great, not a why-did-this-ever-get published book."
1,Very Disappointing,"The characters are extremely unbelievable. The dialogue is poor. I found several glaring mistakes in the grammar, a couple of sentences were completely unreadable with grammar so poor they made no sense. Its the first book that i have ever struggled to finish. A great shame, i enjoyed his book Fortunes of War! This book was a big let down."
2,Pure fluff,"While any book project is a serious undertaking, SAUCER is not a serious book.There are no little green men to wrry about, just an increible stale bunch of venal politician, greedy corporate types, hard charging generals and a guy named Rip who could eat you out of house and home.Oh yeah, there is a saucer (maybe it is alien in origin or maybe it was from the lost ciy of Atlantis) who knows and who cares.This isn't much a book, but if you have 2 or 3 hours to kill and don't want to think about anything serious, this is an okay read."
1,"Dear God, This Was Horrible","I've read (and enjoyed) some real stinkers in my time, but this is by far the worst thing I've ever read. The characters are two dimensional, the plot completely unbelievable, and the science totally baked. This had the potential to be a very good book, but comes off as some ten year old's flying saucer and women fantasy"
3,Apostle Paul and the earliest churches,If you have not studied this subject or viewed other mediums on this subject. You will gain the basic information of the textbook variety; however it should leave you with the desire to read the Bible on Paul's many books.
2,Gina's Review of this book,"My review of this book is somewhat good and somewhat bad, thus I have some good news and some bad. I shall now explain to you the good things about this book. Some of thy good things about this book is that if your deciding to do Frederick Douglass or Harriet Tubman this is a good book for a project but the bad things about the book. Is that say for example you are just doing Harriet Tubman or your just doing Frederick Douglass, it would be difficult to just find information about one, because you could think thier talking about about Harriet you could get the wrong information, and research the wrong information. That is why i would not buy this book, for myself or for anyone that I now. PS: I lllooooovvvvveeeeeeee BILLY"
5,The Best of Cinema!,"La Meglio Gioventu (The Best of Youth). Italian cinema has always been special, but this is a fully mature cinema surpassing American and British work at its best. It is like reading a good book, letting you forget who you think you are and opening your heart to another life. It does take an oldish mind to get the most out of it. What the artists have attempted here is very difficult to pull off, but for me they have done it. Six hours of film, so it requires a large block of your time away from distractions to be a good audience for it. Happily, it is in Italian, with English subtitles, so you can enjoy hearing la lingua italiana bella, which is, after all, always the best part."
1,Perplexed and confused,"Once upon a time there were great Italian films merging with sensitivity and intelligence the personal with the historical: films by Dino Risi, Ettore Scola, Bernardo Bertolucci, and others. The lineage clearly was the inspiration for this two-part television movie which, despite its noble efforts, falls short in several ways.I had read so many glowing reviews of this series (for it is clearly a TV production) that I was all the more disappointed by the by-the-numbers- plot and the uneven acting performances. The production feels in some ways as though it came from a checklist of notable facts gleaned through the past 40 years of European history. There is woefully little in this that feels truly personal, truly the mark of an author. European TV series can be on rare occasions true cinematic creations. This is not one of them by a long shot."
4,An Italian family saga,"It is a beautiful and touching story of an Italian family but the focus is really on two brothers Matteo and Nicola.It is also a good choice for people who like History,because they can follow the political, economical and social changes that took place in Italy from the sixties to 2002.Last but not least , if you speak Italian or if you are learning Italian it is a good way to brush up on the language or to review and consolidate what you have been learning in class."
2,"very slow moving, quite disjointed no natural flow",no natural flow to the storyiline. 2 DVD's . Probably didn't need to be so long seeing as how the movie was lacking any real interest or natural flow. Wouldn't recommend it. Sorry!
2,smoke-free,The book was in good shape but it smells of smoke and I am unable to use it in the house because it stinks up everything. Wish I was warned it came from a smokers house.
4,A good piece of emotional soul.,"As with some other records of MG the songs are a bit alike eachother. However, they're good and when I first got this record, after a swap, I gave it a 3-rate. But by then I didn't know so much about Gaye's work. That would be the same result with you. But keep on playing it and then one day you'll even say ""hey, this is a fiver indeed"". I haven't come to that point yet!"
4,Smooth and Sassy and Sexy,"I guess you can say that I am a Marvin Gaye groupie but I really believe that this is an excellent CD. It has the classic song ""Let's Get It On"" to put you in the mood. But for those who love Marvin there are other hidden treasures including one of my all time Marvin Gaye favorites ""You Sure Love to Ball"" which I think is more romantic and sexy than the classic ""Let's Get It On"". I can listen to the whole thing and some make me want to dance and some make me want to..."
4,"""Stretching"" is Good","Red Garland's ""Stretching Out"" is another one of my Fantasy/OJC warehouse clearance sale finds on the Oldies/Collectables website. This disc couples two original Prestige albums -- ""Satin Doll"" and ""Lil' Darlin'"" -- the majority of which were recorded live at The Prelude, and in fact appear onRed Garland at the Prelude. The CD's first three tracks are from a August 12, 1959 studio date at Van Gelder's with Doug Watkins on bass and Specs Wright on drums. They are solid tunes (especially the studio account of ""Satin Doll,"" but a version of that can also be heard onRediscovered Masters, Vol. 2), but hardly worth the purchase alone. ""Live at the Prelude"" has lots more music than this title, so you can see why ""Strecthing Out"" is being phased out. If you come across it inexpensively as I did, or you're a Red Garland completist, then it's worth it. Otherwise, it's a stretch."
3,Not recommended for newborns,"We received this as a gift, as we registered for all the Windsor products. The springs on this are very stiff, and at 6 weeks old, my daughter still cannot make it bounce. We need to push it with our feet in order to make it bounce. It does not recline, and we need to put receiving blankets on each side of her to prop her up. The fabric cover covers the speaker and makes the music hard to hear. I wish there was a volume control on it. There is also no visual stimulation for her, and she gets bored very easily. Im hoping as she gets older that this comes in more handy.. but I would not recommend this for newborns at all. She gets more entertainment out of the swing. I gave it 3 stars because I like the fabric, and the option for portability."
5,an amazing book,"I found this book while I was living in England at Border's in Oxford. When I look for books I read the first page and if it catches my attention ill read it. When I picked up this book I read the first page and couldn't stop. But I couldn't read the whole book in the store so I bought it. I was also looking for a book because I was taking a week trip in the French Alps. I finished this book in four days. I was addicted. The writing in it was different from any other book I have read. It never got boring and you felt for the main character even though he was a pessimist, and I am the most optimistic person I know. When I was done I gave this book to my friend Paddy to read and he also thought it was great. I definately suggest this book to anyone who is looking for a different style of awesome reading!"
1,save your money,This is NOT a performance dvd of Celine Dion... more like a bunch of music industry folks making money off her name. Don't waste your time.
5,enjoyed,"I have seen this movie sometime back and always enjoyed watching it and it is not a movie that anyone under 13 should watch. All the characters are good in their prspective roles. and of course Tom S. rates high on my list of good actors. There is some comedy in it , but not much, but it still is an enjoyable movie."
5,Early Tom Selleck,I enjoy Tom Selleck movies and I like the earlier ones the best. I've looked for a while for this one to appear on DVD so it was an immediate buy for me.
3,Not Free SF Reader,"Castles and courts suck.Skeeve is left with a lot more than he really wants to have to deal with, let alone just the whole court magician gig. The king bails out due to impending nuptials, and this then leaves someone's mother mad at him, not to mention a fairy godfather, of the somewhat mafioso flavor, as opposed to the Glinda flavour."
4,Great for pregnancy,"These are a huge help for my pregnant swollen ankles! they help a lot when I wear them all day, the top is bit tight, but it could be due to my preganancy. would highly recommend."
1,TOO SMALL,"BY THE TIME I FIGHT WITH THESE TO GET THEM ON MY FEET MY FIGHT WOUL BE OVER AND WOULD NEED A NAP FROM THE STRUGGING. AND IF YOU HAVE NAILS, ITS EVEN HARDER,"
1,eek Technology,eek TechnologyI made the purchase and received the item but not as listed becase in the product description it states there is a landyard that comes with iot and mine did not. I questioned them on this and their response was to contact SanDisk directly and request on. SanDisk in the supplier to eek Technology and they need to be held accountable for their product being properly packaged as listed. They will not do this so I am sending the item back for a full credit. Fellow students have purchased SanDisk Flash Drives from Radio Shack and they come with the landyard. eek Technology drags their feet for issuing a RA# to return this product and I will never purchase from they ever again.
4,sewing for children,Great book for beginners. make copies of the practice pages. my little girl loves sewing the paper without thread and has improved 10 fold.
5,The Gift of an Angel,"We love this product so much when it was given to us years ago, that we purchased more to give as gifts."
4,Doesn't appear to be organic,"Great cereal, but it's not organic. Neither my fresh package from a local store nor Arrowhead Mills' website labels this cereal as organic. Either Amazon is getting product packaged especially for them, or the organic label on this listing is erroneous."
5,Improvement,This was able to comple my Ryobi BT 3000 table saw so that I can now use all the tradition fixtures and jigs on my saw.
