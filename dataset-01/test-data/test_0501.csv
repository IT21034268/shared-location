2,size chart not true to measurments,Ordered a Lg. Carhartt Men's Duck Active Jacket (shipped by Bare Bones Workwear)for my husband for Christmas and received the product only to find that it is too small. I checked user reviews prior to ordering and checked the size chart for the product. I am very disappointed in the return policy. I cannot exchange the product for a larger size. This company requires me to purchase another jacket and send first one back at my cost for shipping. Then I have to wait for them to receive the first one before my refund will be concidered. Why would I pay $80 for another one now to get it before Christmas and don't even know when I will get the refund for this one. This sucks. I will not use this company again.
4,well made and very warm,Im a mechanic and also work outside around the house and this jacket is amazing i find myself wearing 24/7 cuz ita very comfy. I def. Recommend this jacket free shipping will take more then five days but less then 8 but it still beats price of nearby stores
5,Great Christmas gift,"Just what she wanted, fits good, great durability, shipped on time, very pleased with the product. Warm for the winter"
2,Count me among the skeptical,"This book is, as mentioned below, a relic of another time, when people were ""uncovering"" memories of ghastly abuse via hypnosis. This method of therapy has long since been discredited. The ""recovered memory"" therapists were bombarded with lawsuits, and some patients retracted their claims. The book should definitely be taken with a grain of salt."
2,mediocre melodrama,"Sad attempt at a beautiful story. This version lacked substance, though the actors tried to make it fly. I would recommend the original classic or the film starring Anthony Hopkins."
2,Ummm... Yikes!,"My goodness was this a bad version of The Hunchback of Notre Dame. Everything about this production reeks. Not even sexy Salma Hayek could save this classic piece of trash. What is with the persute of printing presses, and since when has the hunchback printed books? I had hoped with all its short commings it might include the original ending, but, alas, Esmerelda lived. The only verson that has the original ending where Esmerelda dies is the 1957 version. THAT version is better than this one. This version also deletes the character of Pheobus and now Esmerelda is accused of killing the king's minister or whatever. Take my advice and try and find the 1982 version ( it is very difficult to locate sometimes.) with Anthony Hopkins and Leslie Anne Down. It is far better."
4,Self feeders,"My daughter has been feeding herself for 7 almost 8 months now but still has trouble using this fork. She does very well with the spoon, and in fact has a different set which came with a spork and she does much better with the spork then the fork. I don't like the handles too much either, they are so narrow and even though they have lumps which my daughter can grip, so as not to slide her hand from back to front, the utensil can still slide from side to side, turning the spoon/fork up and even upside down. I found another set which has a broader handle with grips on the bottom so my daughter can control her grasp in any direction, thus keeping the spoon/spork flat and her hand back on the handle, even when her hands are slick. Can't remember the name though, sorry."
2,Warning - Copy Protection,"I am not going to review weather or not this is musically a great album, so far is sounds good. I am highly disappointed in the copy protection that is implemented on this disk, it makes it fairly hard for a person to simply play the disk on your computer. I figure that this sort of copy protection is even stranger considering it is an enhanced CD and has additional content. To get the disk to work in my computer I had to reload the disk several times to get it to even appear a readable disk. Using the shift key while loading the disk, may or may not help, but I am now listening to the disk, and it sounds pretty cool, but I am definitely going to COPY this cd's audio tracks to a ""non"" copy protected version so that it will play in my audio devices correctly the first time."
4,"Ericsson DS300 Decent sound, useful for office","The vehicle mounting kit and desktop dock mentioned in the item description is not included in the box; those items would have to be acquired separately. Connector is of good quality and should be durable if care is taken when removing it; it engages both of the retainer sockets and will supply power if the socket in the back of the unit is used. You'll need to plug in your own charging cord to use this feature. The speakerphone can be run off the phone's power, but it will drain the batteries quicker; recommend using a power supply input when using it. Sound quality is good and volume capability is decent; construction is oem quality; made in China.Stated Output: 6.0 Volts DC 700mA"
3,a decent little car,"Metal wheels, plastic trucks, weighted...Not terrible..Although if you stop your train quickly it is very short and may derail."
3,Review Revision,We ordered Verbatim disks but received Maxell. At first was very disappointed because we were told by the software company that we must use Verbatim. I submitted a unfavorable review at that time. Out of 30 disks there were only two disks that did not work properly so up grading my opinion at this time.
1,Imagem péssima,"Imagem péssima, este ddv no tem o formato original no comprem isto que é furada , larguem o quanto antes"
4,QUITE GOOD,"This is a full 2.35.1 WideScreen print, not 1.85 as it says on the box.Its not 16.9 anamorphic though,but it zooms up good.Good Color and printA bit overpriced ,but recommended."
5,logic programming,"the term logic programming, regarding the year of the publication was realy very good described in this book, lack of suggesting a new form of operating systems can be understood if we look at the year of the book, japanese designers has done really nice jobs in the topic of artificial intelligence,"
2,Endless mistakes,"Bram Stoker vs. Jack the Ripper? Unbelievable mistakes abound. For one thing, it was Richard Mansfield, not Henry Irving, who was playing in ""Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Hyde"" during the Ripper killings and was only briefly a suspect. For another, Doyle published ""A Study in Scarlet"" in ""Beaton's Christmas Annual"", not ""Pearson's"". If an author is going to drop names all over the place he should at least check his facts. There's also a line about James Barrie writing about fairies, but ""Peter Pan"" wasn't created until 1902 (the play came in 1904). All these errors came before page 80, I stopped counting after that!"
5,Don't Laugh at the Dark Side!,"I am already in my 30s and I still felt so joyful when I finally laid my hands on it! First time I knew about Darth Tater is at work, reviewing advertising reels (I work in advertising), and I just flipped when I saw the ad for Darth Tater. I just knew I had to have it!It's going to sit proudly on my desk - weak-minded Jedi beware!"
5,It's a Spud's Life!,"The moment that I heard Playskool was coming out with a Darth Tater Mr. Potato Head, I knew I had to have one. This is absolutely the cutest (and most fun!) marketing idea to come our way in a very long while. Changing the innocent young spud to the evil Darth (a very cute little Darth) is loads of fun.And... I can't wait for the side-kick spud troopers to hit the stores! The force is with this 'Tater!!!"
4,Tough Potato,Something a little different from the usual Star Wars toys. Great for the younger set and not as many teeny tiny pieces.
5,Nice,I enjoyed listening to the album and even brought three mp3 songs from it. Special has a great voice!
2,"Dont even think about it, it's a waste of money","I first purchased this item after watching the Zeta Gundam series. I thought this would look really cool with my collection...how wrong i was. First of all the figure i got has a missing lower face for the Titan version(very wierd). Also the whole thing is terribly built! The gun didnt even stay together, and to even transform it requires some sort of mental preparation just to be able to put up with the frustration of it all. Posing it is almost impossible because the company that made it put way too many parts into it limiting the figure to just standing. My advice to anyone is to steer clear of this model and save your money, in fact, dont buy any models in this line of figures because while they are cool to look at, none of them are built to last, or even to stand up properly."
4,but it works great in a briefcase or purse...,"So maybe the clip isn't practical for usage on a belt, but it works great to keep it in place in a handbag or briefcase...Before attaching the clip, my phone was forever drifting to the bottom of the bag. Now, that isn't a problem.."
3,Brilliantly shot,"But still falls short in providing a coherent storyline. I have no doubt that this film is more intelligible to those who speak Korean but I was a bit lost at times and couldn't keep up with all the characters.The story is about the angry ghost of a dead student at an all-girl school who periodically turns up in the guise of someone new...or something. Like I said, it's hard to follow. But the eerie photography and reliance on practical scares make it worthwhile. Far too many horror films these days are too slick and well-polished for their own good. Whispering Corridors features a certain rawness in it's grainy film stock and editing that gives the film a rather unique atmosphere.The gore isn't terribly excessive, nor is the film extreme in any way. But if you're in need of something different and with a weird edge to it then go for Whispering Corridors. Try hard to keep up though.The DVD is in 1.85:1 anamorphic widescreen with Dolby/DTS 5.1 sound."
3,Nice Voice,"Sumi Jo has a beautiful voice but her renditions of Motherless Child and Amazing Grace were not impressive at all. The vibrato was too uncontrollable. The Ave Maria was so,so. I did not hear the richeness others have declared in their assesments. Don't get me wrong, the instrument is quite beautiful but only in some selected selections."
4,"Nice china, but damage in shipping","We registered for these at another store, but have received several sets from people through Amazon. Of the three received so far, one arrived broken and must be returned."
3,Lonely Planet Hong Kong Encounter - a Letdown,"I am generally appreciative of what LP books offer - rich details, maps and directions to places that travelers might not discover by other means. I was attracted to the streamlined look and ease of carrying HK Encounter. I never g::ot used to the organization. Part of the book is divided into travel topics: highlights; itineraries; snapshots (further divided into a dozen subtopics); and separate sections on neighborhoods within Hong Kong. I couldn't always figure out what neighborhood I should be searching. I felt their was a sparcity of restaurant listings. On a positive note, the multi-colored maps are an improvement from LP's usual black & white small print maps."
1,"don't buy this book, try something else","I bought this book in his italian translation, anyway I found it very very basic. The examples given are not that great and the price is FAR to high. Try something else"
4,Great Review Book,"I think this book is an excellent review for the GMAT. A recurring problem with this review guide is that there are several typos. The mistakes are noticeable and are easy to spot; however, it is annoying to have to question the publisher. In conclusion, if you are NOT going to attend the review course, I strongly recommend buying this guide over any other.Also, take a look at ETS's review guide. It is an excellent source for REAL GMAT questions used in the past."
1,Waste of Time & Money,"This is a terrible book. My guess is that if you are reading this, then you are outside the target audience of this book (ie, people who have no hope of doing well on this exam). I wish that I had the book with me so that I could quote some of its asinine advice. I recommend instead the Official Guide for GMAT Review."
4,Cracking the GMAT,"I haven't really had a chance to dig into this book yet, but so far it seems very informative."
5,The Dudesons are Awesome,"Hilarious movie! These guys are worse than the Jackass crew. This movie tells all about the beginning of the crew and who they all are, which was good to me because I knew nothing about them. Then, they get to the stunts. Whether it's lighting each other on fire or putting their face in a pile of ants, the pranks never end. You have to cringe at a few of the scenes and yell ""Are you an idiot! Don't do that!"" at the TV screen. I loved it and I love The Dudesons AND their pet pig Britney. Plus, in the extras they have great sound cuts and short bios of a few bands from Finland that play during their movie. I just hope that they come out with a second movie completely filled with crazy stunts."
2,"May work for you, did not for me","It's important to remember we are all different - our skin reacts differently to different things. Even if the active ingredients are the same I've certainly noticed that my skin's reaction can vary, depending on the brand. I've had wonderful experiences with some acne treatments that others insisted were a complete waste. However, this is not one of them. Although it did not make my acne worse, I always had the same amount of acne as if I wasn't treating it at all. To me sure, I tried it for two months. Others insist this is a miracle worker, so hopefully it will work for you."
1,IT IS A WASTE OF MONEY,"THIS PRODUCT IS A WASTE OF MONEY, IT IS VERY EXPENSIVE AND I DIDNT SEE ANY RESULTS, IT DOESNT CLEAR YOUR FACE AND IT DOESNT CONTROL NEW ACNE FROM APPEARING. MY ACNE IS MILD SO I THOUGHT MAYBE IT WOULD HELP ME. IT REALLY IS WASTE OF TIME."
1,This device is NOT described correctly.,Totally agree with the writer from Glendale. Don't buy this cable if you expect that you can remotely connect to the internet using your cell phone and notebook computer.
1,Half truth,"There is much about this book that is solid information. It also has some new facts which one may verify, but to be good history it should be all checkable."
4,Funny Book full of fact and fancy,"This is an extraordinarily entertaining book if not always precise in detail. Many of the above reviewers miss the point -- they fail to address Hayes's arguments; rather they point out similarities to Hayes's home country or even more inexplicably to the US. What does that have to do with his assertions in this book? Whether or not Southeast Asia has a worsee Aids problem has nothing to do with Japan's problems.Also I think there is some misunderstanding of how Hayes uses words -- it's as if some readers simply don't have a sense of humor or sense of wordplay. Hayes is not claiming that Japan is worse overall than other countries; he's simply explaining in lurid and sometimes approximate detail the sicknesses charasteric of Japan. There is no racist intent or result and only the most defensive nature could dream one up.I for one thought it a funny, exciting book."
2,Didn't work for my cats!,"I bought the tattle tale because a friend of mine raved about how they worked so well at keeping her dog off the furniture. However, my cats could have cared less about them! They would jump up on the forbidden piece of furniture, setting off the alarm, and just wait for the alarm to finish so they could curl up and go to sleep."
3,BUYER BEWARE- RICHARD PAUL RUSSO AND RICHARD RUSSO ARE TWO DIFFERENT AUTHORS!,"I bought this book believing it to be by the same Richard Russo who wrote Mohawk, Empire Falls, Straight Man and Nobody's Fool. Well, slap me silly, how was I to know the difference when Amazon have the books of both authors all listed together. Since I was now the proud owner of a book I no longer wanted, what else do you do with it but read it? I mean, with a hefty 624 pages you could also use it to prop up the end of your sofa!On a serious note, if you are a reader of futuristic detective novels, you will probably enjoy Carlucci. In my opinion, this author does not possess the literary skills of Richard Russo (Richard Russo without the Paul, that is) but Carlucci does have some interesting plots and is filled with lots of action and excitement."
5,Love this Fence.....it works great!,I should of got this a long time ago.....I am a boxer breeder and I have several large boxers. At first it hurt there feelings and they ran into the house and wouldn't come back out but after a few days and couple of shocks they don't go near it. This fence has saved my dogs lives! I have it set on 3 and it will go to 5.....so it works really well! I recommend it to anyone that needs to keep there dogs safe from the road.......It works well!
4,Seems to be working great so far,"Took us awhile to get it installed around entire yard but seems to be working just fine. One of our dogs was a fence climber and it's keeping him in the yard. The line of wire that we wrapped which was supposed to create a dead zone isn't dead so we have to take the collars off before they come back into the house and put them on only after they're outside which is a bit of a hassle. But the fence, itself, works great. I love that we can turn the distance down so low and can also adjust the degree of charge for the dogs' individual personalities."
1,Bad product,"Spent 8 hours installing the fence only to have it stop working completely after 3 months. Customer service told me I had a ""partial break"" in the wire. Good luck on finding it in 1400 ft of wire. Waste of money and time."
3,Electric underground dog fence,"The price of this fence kit was the best after shopping around online and in stores. The product does what it claims. However, placement and installation are MUCH more complicated than they claim. Unless your yard is set up perfectly, it will take much more time and effort to install and perfect this fence. If I had it to do again, I would have spent the extra $150 and purchased from a company that would install it."
2,Not too happy,"After reading the good reviews for this item, I thought it would be perfect for my unfenced yard. I purposely purchased the ""Stubborn Dog"" fence for my rottweiler puppy figuring he was probably going to be a handful when he got older. Turns out he's already a handful - not only was he running through our underground fence at 8 months old, he was also running through my next door neighbor's fence (also the PetSafe Stubborn Dog). I guess we'll just leave the wiring in for now, but I doubt we'll ever be able to use it again. It sounds like the fencing works with other types of dogs, just not the big stubborn ones."
2,"Great concept, horrid inception","I purchased this device over the Sony CS1 due to it's superior batter life and better chipset. I was sorely disappointed with the software included however. I have a 64bit XP machine and a Mac OSX laptop. Neither are supported. I ended up installing 32bit XP in Parallels on my Mac, and the software works there. However the software is so poor, it's almost unusable. I bought Google Earth Plus, as it is supposed to integrate, but you have to jump through hoops to get it going. The kicker is you can only export 95 waypoints per file. So mapping trips is impossible. When I tried a few 95 point sets during my travels today they were generally all a jumble around one general area.I can't explain my disappointment in words. I'm going on a big trip in 6 days and hoped to geotag my photos, but it's impossible with this device.I'm going to rush order the Sony CS1, or maybe a full fledged handheld GPS if I can find one with a super battery life."
1,Globalsat dg-100 data logger = 0 star rating,"Simply stated: GlobalSat owes me money for messing with their junky software without success. I bought this product and the software does not work. The software does not recognize the com port available for use. The actual data logger might be good, but you can not use it without the software."
5,Works like a charm,"I'm active duty Air Force, and I ordered one of these to test as a replacement for a much older, bigger and more expensive GPS logger that we had been using. We were all very surprised and pleased with the result. The software really isn't that bad, and lets you make many modifications to the default settings of the device. We've tested it in multiple aircraft from high speed fighters to slower bomber aircraft, and it worked surprisingly well. The pilots just turned it on, slipped it into a pocket and flew their mission, then just turned it off. We were able to get good data on their position, speed, altitude - everything we needed!"
1,Worse than the console versions,"i appreciate every game released for mac but this isnt really an excuse for a game. If you've played it or seen it played on one of the consoles and it seemed like a good game (like i did) dont buy it for Mac or PC. The game has been dumbed down for the PC and Mac. The fight scences are choppy and poorly coordinated. The graphics are bad compared to the consoles. You need a heavy duty Computer to run the game smoothly. The whole ""no where you cant go nothing you cant do"" phrase would be correct if you took the ""t""s of the cants. I seriously must warn you you wont be getting a good game at all. Thank god i didnt buy it."
4,soft,As I expected these shoes are very comfy. I have had them over a year and work 40 hours a week in them as a nurse. I think they are about done for and will be buying another pair.
4,Dove Hunting,"Although this book is a little old, it still contains some very basic information that can be very useful to the novice dove hunter. It is well written and flows easily. Although I have hunted doves for years in Texas, it still explained some things I never knew. It was a great buy."
3,Thick and Creamy,"I like the fact that this cocoa butter is fragrance free as I seem to be sensitive to lotions that have a heavy fragrance. Lotion was creamy and long lasting. A little too heavy for my needs, but did work well on dry skin."
5,"If you love barbecue, this tells you EXACTLY where to go.","An exceptionally useful and informative book. This is a review of the best barbecue restaurants in the country by two men who set out on a barbecue ""quest"". Each restaurant chosen is described in both a charming and mouthwatering fashion by men who obviously love barbecue. In the last part of the book they offer outstanding recipes from some of the best BBQ joints as well as information on cooking and putting together your own backyard barbecue. Fun reading if you love to eat and fun eating if you follow their advice. Recommended!!!"
5,"""Living In The Future Is Great""","I enjoy the television show Greek and I am very pleased to find these DVDs upon Amazon.com. I must say that living in ""the Future"" is really great because even though I am ""middle age,"" I can remember wishing there was a way to buy my favorite television shows so I could watch them over & over again and during ""the Future"" that has become possible through Amazon.com at a very reasonable price."
2,Greek Season 2,I did receive my purchase but it took over 3 weeks. Also no confirmation number was attached so I had no idea where it was or when I would receive. I was quite dissatisfied with the way they ran things.
3,Good collection of ambient melancholy,"I bought this because it contained a previously unreleased Robert Fripp Soundscape (or more likely, an edited excerpt thereof), but I like most of the dark compositions on this 2 CD set, most of which contain some very good ideas. Rather like a hellish Riven soundtrack. Recommended."
1,Got a message? Send a telegram,"Theme is UGLY IS FOREVER and the only solution to being ugly is DIE. What endures is the blue rabbit the monster carved and which ""outlived"" him, his ugliness and the devastation his ugliness caused. I'll be darned if I can figure out why this book got written--or published. I'd love to hear the story."
5,nuclear waste repository,"This is a beautiful book, well written with a lot of very interesting ideas put forward. The at the first reading, the Big Ugly Monster seemed alot like radioactive waste that destroys any container that holds it. Finally, only something made perfectly by the Big Ugly Monster can contain it, and long outlast the monster. In the end the Little Stone Rabbit is probably more impervious than Yucca Mountain and would be an ideal candidate for lining the ITER (International Thermonuclear Experimental Reactor)."
3,still looking for breakfast,"I started out thinking they were OK, a little more substance than the breakfast bar from Whole Foods. But after I ordered a 12-pack (I didn't realize it was 12 boxes of 8), and had eaten them for a couple of weeks as I was flying out the door, I realized they were not really very tasty and kind of dry."
4,GREAT mid morning snack,"I like them as a midmorning snack with a cup of coffee. They are also great for those mornings you really aren't in the mood for breakfast, but know you'll be hungry later. They seem to keep you satisfied for an hour or two. They do taste great - not too sweet and not overly cake-like. Buy a bunch and keep them in the freezer until you need more."
5,Love the minis,These cookies are awesome! I like the mini size cookies to use as a small breakfast or healthy snack in the afternoon.
3,It's okay,"The taste was not as great as the other flavors. It was a bit dry and sandy, if that cAn be a description"
4,"Wouldna, Never, Ever","Paige, Paige, Paige what can I say. I guess she was living for a dollar and a dream thinking Marlon would marry her. It took getting held down and beat up to find out she wasted her time with him because he is a momma's boy. But the things he does for his momma doesn't make sense! Why would he marry a chick that he didn't love or want just to please his momma? Why would he put his children and happiness on hold for his momma's sack. Lucille was an evil woman and wrong to tell the lies that she did. Even after finding all that out Marlon stuck with her. See that's what I mean something is wrong with that. Did she do voodoo on him or what? Paige finds some happiness in the end but of course she stepped on some squirrels during the way. Celeste is another evil being that needs to be settled. Hopefully the sequal will put her in her place but I have a feeling there will be much more drama in store for Ms. Paige before all is said and done."
4,Drama Luva,"This is my first time reading La Jill Hunt's work and I was very impressed! I will definately be checking out ""Drama Queen"" and ""No More Drama"".This book kept me turning the pages until the end. I felt for Paige and everything she went through with Marlon and his crazy alcoholic mama. I just hated how the book left me hanging wanting to know what Paige was going to do to Ms Lucille when she discovered that Miss Lucille & Kasey had given Myla & Savannah DNA tests!! We need a Shoulda, Coulda, Woulda part 2! Big ups to Ms Hunt for this one. My money was well spent !"
4,Wonderful,This book was great from the first page to the last page. I know there is going to be a sequel to this book it just has to. It was so good I finished it is one and a half days. keep up the great work Mrs. Hunt.
2,uh huh,"unless you are in peak performance mode this is certainly not for you. Was looking for a bar work out that was a bit less complicated than the New York City Ballet one, but this is just a really really fast and furious aerobics work out. Very disappointed."
2,Not good direction,"The barre segment of this dvd was really hard to follow. I had to pause multiple times to figure out how she did a move before I could begin. I feel you could also injure your knees easily with this workout. She goes too fast between moves without proper direction. I really liked the arm segment and the ab portion was fun, but the poor direction kills this video for me."
4,xtend barre: LEAN & CHISELD,"Great dvd about barre classes. Very good warm up, excellent ab workout, very good upper and lower body exercises , too."
4,Great book,I really enjoyed this Easy Rawlins novel. Mosley is an easy read with interesting story and characters. Denzel should do another movie as Easy Rawlins.
2,So... where's the plot?,You'll have to toil hard to find the plot among the pages. I'm not saying that the main story is bad but it could be written in 100 pages or so. The rest of the book is really boring.
1,The Secound track is the only good song on the album,"The second track is the only good song on the album,the rest of the songs slow,wired,and boring."
2,Meat Beating? More fun by far...,"Hey boys and girls! Guess WHAT! Today I took a synthesizer, turned the volume WAAAAY up on the television, and started banging the keys at random! I did it OVER and OOOOVER again, and now I have an ALBUM, which I'll sell to brainless drones without a clue. Hail me as a GOD, peons!Seriously folks, this album is the dullest party I have ever bought. I compare it to having a fight with a teddy bear. Rowl! That thing has a BITE! It has one or two clever moments, but no class, no clever, and no climax. It's like the Propellorheads, but half as good and a third as cool. The stupid CD art doesn't even make a good coaster. Skip it."
5,Great Music,"Violeta, Angel and Isabel alternate songs in a great mix of traditional and original music. Wonderful. (too bad they misspelled the name of the disk - Chants ..."
2,Misleading Subtitle,"Mr. Bates' book is long on problem definition but miniscule on what to do about it. He does an excellent job of describing how the ""New Economic Disorder"" came about, but to suggest that there are mitigating ""Strategies"" for your personal finances in the book is highly misleading. In fact, I would say that his recommendations for dealing with the current financial crisis at a personal level almost seem to be an afterthought."
1,End Times Prophecy and Conspiracy Theorist,"One should really open a book these days and not assume the title reflects the contents. Here are some highlights:The UN is going to try and take our money and redistribute it in their new world order, which is prophesied in the Bible as a sign of the end times.Those pesky homosexuals and women world leaders are inciting God's fury.NAFTA is the first step to the new world order, which would eventually abolish ordered government, eliminate private property and inheritance, abolish patriotism, rid the world of religion and destroy the family unit.Buy metals, coins, stocks, real estate and collectibles.Reduce debt, move to the country, have a 90 day food supply and water filters, stock up on medicines, pray and share the gospel.Sure, there is some information on our financial system peppered throughout the book, but the underlying conspiracy theories completely invalidate the veracity of this information."
5,facts every american citizen should know,THIS BOOK HELPS ME TO UNDERSTAND THE CRAZZINESS THAT IS GOING ON IN WASHINGTON . OUR FREEDOM IS BEING STEADILY SWEPT AWAY BY THE RADICAL LEFT.THIS BOOK IS NOT JUST ABOUT FINIANCES BUT ABOUT LOSS OF THE FREEDOMS THAT WE HAD IN THIS GREAT COUNTRY.PLEASE READ IT FOR YOURSELFAND UNDERSTAND WHAT IS GOING ON.
3,Make sure you are buying what you think your buying.,This good book would have been better if it had been the one I wanted. I acted too quickly when seeing a good price. The one I wanted was a recently updated edition. The one I bought was the original. Look carefully before buying.
2,Repetitive and Shallow,"I was disappointed with the book. While there are some facts I learned from the book, I was hoping for more. The book repeats a stern warning over and over. Giving the author the benefit of the doubt, I continued to read. Near the very end of the book, there is a checklist to follow to ""protect"" yourself from the upcoming crisis but was mainly common sense stuff. ""Transfer of Wealth"" was discussed but what was missing was how would one be on the right side of this transfer? The answer to this question was brief and shallow. It was a good book for the very uninformed."
5,Must reading,"Larry Bates sounds like an alarmist or something, but what he says makes sense and I have heard similar things from reliable sources. I would recommend this for anyone who wants to have an understanding of how the world economy and political system works. I also have bought The Bilderberg Group by Daniel Estulin. I have only started reading it, but it seems excellent so far."
2,Too Difficult/Not Designed Practically,"I am not happy with this shape sorting cube...my 21 month old daughter hasn't at all be interested in it yet. To get the shapes out, one side of the cube slides out, but the problem is that it slides out so easily that it doesn't stay in place at all when searching for the right opening for the cubes! One side is a plank of wood with no openings...not very attractive. There are also a lot of different shapes, it takes a lot of patience to figure them all out and it is frustrating.

5,Great Wooden toy for a 18-36 months old!,"We bought this product, even though he had another plastic sorter.He prefered this one instantly! It feels great on the hands and it's lots of fun, because it comes with so many shapes..I think they enjoy it more when they are closer to 24 months..because some shapes are difficult.The top part broke, but my son was using it as a stool! lolIt's very durable..Great toy!"
3,Challenging Sorter,"I like how many different shapes come with this sorter but it is challenging! Some of the shapes look really similar and this toy can be frustrating for kids. I also don't like how the box closes. The cube we received has the lid that slides in and out, but it doesn't fit well and the wood is splintering on the lid. It is also hard to put lower shapes in once the box is getting full, the other shapes get in the way. This shape sorter is ok but there are probably better options available."
3,"Great toy, but...","I love this shape box for my twin boys. However, it's wooden and I have gotten a few splinters from the box. I always supervise my boys when they're playing with this toy, and I never let them put the box in their mouth. The actual shapes are a lot smoother. I would recommend trying to find a plastic version."
2,Lid falls off too easily,"As others have said, the lid comes completely off. I guess the manufacturer assumes a toddler is going to push the shapes in from the side and not turn the block upside down. Plus I think some of the shapes are a little complex. In addition to the basic shapes, there is a hexagon and a octagon which look very similar to a toddler and they get frustrated when it doesn't go in the hole they think it should.My daugher's speech therapist has a Playskool form fitter (shape sorter) and it is much better but I can't seem to find it in stock anywhere. It is plastic and the lid snaps shut. The shapes are simpler (star, square, circle, triangle, rectangle, diamond) and there are 2 holes for each shape so you don't have to find just the 1 hole to fit the shape."
5,motor skills,I wish they had more toys like this so kids can learn shapes and motor skills. I remember the red & blue ball when my kids were little with all the yellow shapes and that was the best! Now that I am looking for the same kind of toy for my grandson and can't find anything close to it.
2,Could have been a little better,I got these for my little one for Christmas and was a little unhappy with the craftsmanship. Its flemsy! I love Melissa and Doug toys and normally dont have an issue with them. The lid is horrible. Wish I read the reviews before purchase. Two stars is my rating and one of the stars is only because I love the melissa and doug brand
2,Poor Quality,"The sliding panel is too thin and just falls out. Also, it only took our 15 month old son a few days to split one of the blocks in half. You would think that it would be hard to mess up such a simple product but cutting costs on materials had a big impact."
4,Perfect playmate!,We purchased three of Melissa & Doug's toys for our one year old and he loves them. He pulls them out of the toy chest and plays with them all the time. We make it a family event and play with him also.
1,breaks easily,"On christmas morning my 2yr old opened this and within one hour had completely broken the lid. Also as he attempted to get shapes into the cube pieces of wood chipped off. Which can be a choking hazard or a splinter hazard. I went with this one because i thought would would be more durable, it is not the case."
2,Poor Design,The square hole and rectangle hole allows all other shapes to pass through. Young children will think that all shapes fit in squares. Both of my children are not being challenged for they can just put all of the pieces into one hole alone. What is this teaching children? The wrong lesson! Very disappointed.
1,Who thought of this ridiculous toy?,"The lid comes off immediately. We thought it was defective so we brought it back to Toys R Us and got a new one but that is the way it is designed. What kid could or would want to hold the lid the entire time they are playing with the toy to make sure it doesn't come off. Also, our son would just put the shapes in the open side once the lid fell off or he'd get upset that everything he put into the shape sorter fell out.I cannot imagine anyone tested this product. Toys R Us makes a wooden shape sorter that is much more environmentally friendly and no danger of lead. That one has a side that slides off and it's easy enough for a 2 year old to figure out but not so easy that it falls off. That one was a much better idea. What were Melissa and Doug thinking here.[...]"
3,should not be returned in the 12-18 month category,This toy turned up in the 12-18 month search. The product description is that the toy has small parts and is for 3 years old and up. My 12 month grandchild got this gift as a pesent and she immediately put the small shapes in her mouth. We have put the toy away for now.
3,"Yes, it is about time. But...","...a quibble - you decide how minor. The opening credits aren't original. The original white ""Speed Racer"" title's been replaced by the newer red, trademarked logo. That in itself isn't all that big a deal (unless, like me, you still think Star Wars oughtn't say ""Episode IV"" no matter what George Lucas says), but what is a big deal is that the whole credit sequence is obviously the time-compressed version from when the series aired (briefly) on MTV. For those of us who were glued to the TV every day after school watching the show, the obvious ""rushing"" of the theme music is jarring - and given the format (DVD and not broadcast TV) inexcusable."
4,A (Speedy) Drive Down Memory Lane,"First of all, the dvd I recieved didn't have the collector's rubber dvd case, that having been said I was still very happy for being able to see these old episodes again.As a huge fan of the series in my youth, and still being quite the kid now, I was very happy these episodes made it to dvd.A must for fans of the old series, or anyone curious to see where the Wachowski's new movie all started from!"
5,My Kids Love Speed Racer!,I remember watching Speed Racer as a kid and now my own children cannot wait to get off of the school bus a watch this great cartoon with their dad.
4,Timeless,"One of my best purchases of the year. All episodes here are top notch and include my all-time favorite, the three-part episode ""The Most Dangerous Race"".It has been a long time since I've watched the episodes on television, so I can't comment about lack of quality due to compression or shorter lenght of time in some episodes. But I sure think the producers should have put all 52 episodes into one single DVD box.Technical aspects aside, the episodes are timeless. Adventure, friendship, charismatic villains, cool cars, clever plots. Of course, the potential is limited due to the quality (or lack of it) of some Japanese animated productions. But, considering when it was made (in the sixties), Speed Racer is still head and shoulders above a lot of Japanese productions"
5,Excellent,I hope this book is reprinted. It is the single source book of code that I keep on my desk. I have recommended it everyone who asks and I am sorry to see it is gone!!
1,Not a USA version,I sent this back. I HAVE NEVER RECEIVED MY MONEY BACK! DO NOT USE THIS COMPANY!It wasn't stated that it wouldn't play on dvd players in the United States. Very disappointing
1,What's going on?,I bought series 4 and 5 from here and series 4 was a repeat of series 3 and series 5 turned out to be repeats of ones we've already seen.What's going on?
4,Dorcy 2D Xenon flashlight bulb.,"This is a nice upgrade replacement bulb. Slightly brighter than Krypton bulbs, nowhere near as expensive as the led replacements."
3,Good images of the present and times gone by.,"A lot of people seem to find Gomez's characters flat and his plots implausible and boring. While I agree that nothing much happens in the course of the novel, what made it worth reading were small portions of the characters' lives that finally resemble my own. I never thought anyone else out there ever debated the economy of frozen pizza, but Gomez nailed the ethos of the freezer section exactly. Similarly, in his characters, I catch glimpses of a generation just a few years older than mine. I was in grade school when his characters were in high school, but every now and then, movies and music crossed over. So maybe Gomez gives me something of my own childhood, if not adolescence. Despite certain quirks of style and th lack of the standard 'rising action-climax-resolution cymbal crash' these little tidbits made the book worthwhle for me."
1,Sadly Disappointing,"This book, which claims to give an honest portrayal of a group of 20-something individuals, over-educated and underemployed, who thrive within the indie/alternative subculture, is an insult to anyone who is actually involved in that culture. I speak from first-hand experience, as I'm currently 22, armed with a degree in two fields, the creator of my own zine, and working at a dead-end job while waiting for something better to come along. I'm involved with and knowledgable about the alternative subculture that Gomez is attempting to portray here, but what he writes is pure crap. Anyone who cannot go a single page without throwing in some token quote or song lyric in an attempt to prove his indie credibiltiy is just sad. All in all, this book is not worth the money or the time."
1,Big disappointment,"The wood pieces were not sanded, in fact they are splintered. The paint was not evenly sprayed. The bolts and tools weren't easy to use together.There was a greasy substance across the tool box."
2,Not the same quality as other Melissa and Doug Toys,"Although we usually really like Melissa & Doug toys, this one was simply not up to par. The heads of most of the bolts and ""nails"" (i.e. pegs) had split within the first few weeks of normal toddler play. It's a good concept, but the wood is not tough enough for what it's designed to accomplish."
3,Not bad for Melissa & Doug,"Generally speaking, I find M&D; toys to be cheap and overrated, but I really enjoy playing with this one with my 16-month-old son. We got it as a gift, and so far he enjoys banging the hammer on the nails, playing with the screws and nuts, and dropping the screws through the holds on the side. I enjoy the ways I can use this toy to introduce, colors, numbers, same/different, in/out and so forth. I don't take it seriously as a miniature working set of tools, but as a bunch of interestingly shaped wooden pieces that my son can use imaginatively, it's not half-bad.That said, as per usual with M&D;, the ""craftsmanship"" is shoddy, the materials are poor and I know it won't be a lasting toy, but what are you gonna do?"
5,Wooden tool box,"Durable and realistic with lots of tools and places on the tool box to use them. Self contained, colorful and great for hand eye coordination."
2,just ok,I though my son would love this toy but all he loves is the hammer that he can hit his sister with.
2,Not for medium to large cans,"I read the reviews and was very excited to receive my order.I had to bend the shelves to install them. It can't be that sturdy if you can bend it for installation. I was only able to hold large cans on the top rack. I put the 2nd one not in the proper place so I could fit cans on the bottom. Small condensed cooking soups would fit great or cat food cans. I put small cans of coffee on the bottom, the 2nd was smaller from my installation method(not proper way) to fit aluminum foil and the top has cat food cans and more small cans of coffee (Chock Full O Nuts 10.5oz cans)"
1,Great idea...,"The Organize it All 1866 Soup Can Rack is a disappointment. It arrived today, and started to put it together. The instructions are terrible, relying on diagrams only. Unfortunately, the diagrams are not clearly drawn. In addition to terrible instructions, the one I received seems to be defective. The frame is too wide for the shelves. The instruction packet gives a phone number and an email address to contact the company, but a representative is only available from 10-12 and 2-4, Eastern time. I have emailed the manufacturer and hope they will supply a frame that is a correct size."
3,Another Okay can rack,Shipping was quick and they arrived on time.Box was a bit big and one of the racks got alittle bent but managed to bend it back into shape.This can storage rack is okay but it's not FIFO which means you have to unload it to rotate you new stock to the back.
4,Good space saver,"At first I was a little set aback because one of the bars was a little bent and it clearly was in used condition, but I put it together anyway. fits about 50 cans, so I am quite pleased with that. A lot more organized."
1,Assembly not for the faint hearted!,"I guess some people got a properly manufactured product and some of us didn't. The back piece is too wide so you do have to ""manhandle"" this quite a bit to get it togther. After 20 minutes, I am still struggling with it. As I put the second and third shelves on, the first one pops out. I am not looking forward to the dividers (I did try the dividers on the first shelf when I put it in, and did have to bend everthing to get them on -- but they promptly popped off when I tried to add the second shelf (because I was having to bend everything to get that shelf in . . . ).I also (like some others)did not realize just how HUGE this thing is. It will not fit into most people's pantries (it is too wide AND too tall for average pantry use).All in all, I DO NOT RECOMMEND THIS PRODUCT. I am thinking of sending it back, but I already read that another person had a problem with that, so buyer beware!"
1,cheap crap,the product arrived broken and keeps falling apart so save your money for something else like it or just stack the cans..
3,Sturdy storage option,Great item and holds lots of cans but is a bit larger than I expected. It won't fit in my pantry but works well on a shelf in the garage
2,Not well built,"One sauder was broken on arrival. One edge was bent. The shelf attachments and can dividers are not well machined/fitted, so it is not as stable as I'd like. The rubber feet are not well fitted to the wire , so they are already coming off. Just weak all over - for the price I expected a bit better. Slow shipping too."
4,Good Pellet,Pretty good pellet. Most of them fit tightly into the barrel. I had about 1 flyer out of 10. 1 inch groups at 25 yards out of a Gamo Big Cat.
2,not a good introduction...,"i have the first edition of this book, and have found it difficult to learn subversion from it. it's hard to find simple how-to steps for basic tasks, and most of the time i wind up having to look on the internet to find the information. i've had to annotate the book quite a lot, writing simple examples in the margins to make up for the lack of them in the text. for instance, the section on ignoring certain files is only one page long, and doesn't mention anything about ignoring entire directories, or what to do if the directory is already in the repository. things you can eventually figure out on your own, but which are the whole point of buying a book - to do all that work for you, and save you from having to search on the internet!"
3,"Concise, but unnecessary","There's nothing in this book that you can't look up in the svn documentation. However, it is a good introduction and makes the learning curve a little less steep for beginners."
3,Was sent old/ stale candy,I was happy with the contents of this Haribo mix but unfortunately both bags I ordered were stale and on the hard side.
1,Very Scary!,I bought this dryer after my hair stylist recommended it. I was excited to use it but the first time I plugged it in and turned it on sparks flew out of the motor. Smoke then followed with an electrical fire smell.... Very scary. I might have just gotten a defective product but I wasn't willing to try it again.I will also say this dryer is very heavy. My husband even thought so.
1,Stopped working!,"I LOVE this hair dryer. Worked great, never wanted to look back. But it's 3 months later now, and it does not heat up!It only blows cold air...... It would be great if i could get another one sent to me, and return this one, but my 'return window' is closed..."
5,housewife,i think amazon has the best prodects and the best prices and they stand buy them( t01000151001 ) marie
5,The Great Good Thing,"The Great Good Thing is a wonderful story for all ages and one of my favorite books! It combines fantasy and adventure, dreams and friendship. This is truly one of the best books of all time!"
3,meh,"I bought this as a read-aloud based on the rapturous reviews here, and was ultimately disappointed. The premise is interesting -- the characters in a book carry on with their lives after the Reader closes the book, but as time goes on with no readers, they begin to rust and lose purpose. Sylvie, this storybook's princess, has ventured beyond the book and into her Reader's dreams, which is considered scandalous, but may ultimately save all her book's character's when the Reader dies and she must find another.The idea is interesting and some parts were quite touching, but the plot was rather plodding and confusing, threads were left dangling, and at the end, we all just thought, hmmmm. Didn't resent the time spent on it, but none of us were enchanted either."
3,24?,The batteries are good but I only received 15 in the package. Wassup wit dat?Still a good deal. It would cost more to return than it's worth.
5,Awesome,"Phantasia are the best because of all the unique shapes, regular bears are boring as hell. Four more words required for this review."
3,passable,"it was not as clean as I would have expeected. It sounds like it has a few little scratches. Not enough that you can.t listen to it, but just enough that you know that somthing is there.This is the first time I have ever recieved one like this."
2,Didn't think this would happen...,"Overall the knife works very well. It is not that sharp when I received mine though, it definitely needs some sharpening. I have used it to hack through wood and other things and have tested it thoroughly. I will say it holds up pretty well to anything I cut with it. The thing that really bothered me is the grip fading away. When i cleaned my blade with water, to get some tree sap and other stuff off of it, when it dried, I realized that the grip portion has begun to fade away. Now I love the way the black and orangey wood colors go together, but I HATE how it looks now... I guess this is more of just a display knife if you want the grip to remain the same. I haven't bought the all black one so I can't speak for that KA-BAR but as for this one, I am unsatisfied."
4,Comfortable,"I was looking for a comfortable seat as a replacement for my stock seat on my new hybrid bike. My old bones expect more comfort than I guess is standard these days.The seat is a gel core wrapped in a leather-like shell on a hard plastic base. The metal mounting bracket underneath the seat is molded into the plastic shell, but it does have an adjustable bracket. The cover has a textured finish that prevents slipping, but seems tough enough not to wear out any time soon.It looks like a good seat at a good price, and it is easy on my old bones."
3,fuel door 6051,"VERY NICE,BUT MISSING SCREWS AND HOLES WHERE IN THE WRONG PLACE ! I HAD TO MAKE THEM AND BUY THE SCREWS !"
1,Never worked!,"My parents got this for our preschool/young elementary boys for Christmas. They actually got 2 sets since they would be opening them at the same time as their cousins. However, we didn't have 20 extra batteries on hand (10 needed per set!) so the kids were disappointed not to be able to use them right away.Later when we did try them, it was almost impossible to even get the battery compartments open. The screws stripped just trying to open and close the battery doors. Then the cars themselves were barely responsive. They only worked for a few minutes, were very loud, and would only move a few inches at at time, even with brand new fully charged batteries. Needless to say, we were quite disappointed in what could have been a really fun toy."
2,Lots of errors and not adequate for the exam,"This book had quite a number of errors in the command syntax asindicated by a lot of the other reviewers. I had to doublecheck the command against the Pix manual or the Pix itself toknow which is which and what is what.Some of the answers in their test engine were wrong as well.After taking the exam, I also found it did not cover about 15 percentof the exam objectives such as the FWSM, auto-update server, management center, etc."
4,Pretty Easy Language-and this Helps,"Indonesian and Malaysian were originally developed as practical trader /trading languages, so they are not so complex. You can carry this book, or just push your way through in English!Or, depend on the phrasebook at the back of the Lonely Planet Shoestring Guide to Asia, available on Amazon."
5,Fantastic 12,"This has got to be one of Bettye's best releases. It is very seldom I like every track on a disc. There isn't one song I'm not happy with. Of course, I do have a few favorites: Forecast, Serves Him Right, and When the Blues Catch Up With You...WOW!"
4,SK3,This is a good product. It gave me the memory to use more capabilities of my Sidekick 3. It is a good addition to a person on the go.
1,"AWFUL PRODUCT, AND EVEN MORE HORRIBLE CUSTOMER SERVICE!!!!!!!!!!!!","DONT DO BUSINESS WITH THIS SELLER!!!!!!!!!!I purchased this memory card and when I tried to use it in my phone it read ""not formatted"" so I formatted it on my laptop & tried again, nothing so I wrote to the seller & was told that they would send me a new one immediatly. I mailed the old one in the next day and waited, Since I hadn't recieved a new card I e-amiled the seller again and they tried to play stupid! Like they had no idea of the previous conversation promising a new one. I again waited and then sent them a nasty e-amil demanding a resolution and still it has been over a month & I'm out of a card and out of my money!!!!! This company sucks and so do their NO NAME products. I really should have taken into consideration of the other negative ratings on Amazon."
1,not good at all,"My grandson who is 5 likes the ""song"" DVD, but the ""nursery rhyme"" one is awful. After every 2 songs it goes back to the beginning and has something like a commercial and says it was recorded for on demand tv. I do not recommend this purchase at all."
3,More like a book than a reference,"A great idea with good information, but poorly laid-out. It reads like a book rather than a ""guide."" Probably a good read before you go, but not a good idea for a book to take with you for hints once you get there"
4,Great Book both as an instructional tool and reference,"This book was used in my 1994 Bachelor's program in Workforce Education, Training, and Development undertaken at Southern Illinois University, Carbondale, Illinois. It provided readily applied techniques for improving employee performance. I still use it today as a wonderful reference tool. I receommend this book to anyone tasked with instructional design."
4,WHAT A MOVIE,L.A.STREET FIGHTERS is the best gang fighter movie in the 80'si saw it in 1987 havent seen it since so send it to me and ill pay you`
5,Wonderful surprise,"I enjoyed all the books in this bundle. Well worth the price.The Highlander Leonora & DillonHighland Barbarian (Historical Romance)Meredith & BriceHighland Heather (Harlequin Historical, No 65)Brenna & MorganHighland Fire (Harlequin Historical, 91)Megan & KieranHighland Christmas - Lindsay & Morgan (Novella)"
3,Not great quality,"My two-year-old loves music class, and these instruments are similar to the ones she uses there. The maracas do not sound that great, as there are barely any beans inside (or whatever is inside). The cymbals do not make the expected sound, just kind of, well, a sound like two pieces of metal clanging together. The tamborine seems fine, it did not break, as per other reviewers. The clacker thing works OK, no problems with that. The triangle seems a bit heavy for small children, and its sound is not as delicate as I expected. One of the maracas is a little chipped from being hit with the tamborine stick, so you'd think the paint wouldn't come off that fast. The maracas have not broken, as per other reviewers. The quality on this Melissa and Doug toy seems a bit cheap."
4,Good set,"Very nice small set of instruments. Be ready cause they all bang, clank or shake in some way. Bought them for my 2 and 4 year old."
4,"cute music maker set, but....","This set is really cute, and my 17 month old son really enjoys it, but I think the quality could be better. The first day playing with it, the wooden noise makers fell apart. The strings kept coming undone, and they still do after being played with for a while. Also, the maracas don't make as much noise as you would expect them too. Other than that, i think this is a great set for any child."
2,Eh - not as good as I thought it would be....,"I bought this percussion set from Melissa and Doug because they have a great reputation for quality and great wooden products. After around 2 uses the tambourine developed a hole on its skin and the maracas got a crack. I love the idea of having musical instruments for kids but if you're going to make these products specifically for young children, you better make sure that they can withstand the wear and tear of this age bracket."
4,Band in a box,The Band in a Box is very durable and makes a great gift for young children and getting them involved in music at a very young age.
4,Making music,This is great- we are going to use the instruments at our reception so people can play along with the music.
5,This ROCKS!,"I bought this band in a box for my son because it was cheaper than buying plastic, loud versions of the instruments individually. I worried that my two-year-old would be bored with these, as there are no flashing lights or applause. But weeks later, he still goes for these toys first. His electronic maracas have been abandoned because these instruments are so much more fun!"
3,Just OK,"I purchased this for my 2 yo. She does enjoy playing with the instruments and passes them out to everyone in the family so that we can all play together. Unfortunately, the product is not very durable. The white drum pad on the tamborine tore the first day she played with it. So we just tore the entire drum pad off and she just uses the tamborine without it. Also, the paint on the shakers have begun to chip off after a couple of uses. The cymbals do not make much of a sound, but my daughter does like clanging them together...good for eye-hand coordination. I probably would purchase another set next time around...one that is better quality."
3,"So-so; some items are fine, others are poor quality","We got this as a Christmas present for our nearly 3-year old. He is really into musical instruments, and we thought he'd love this.While he does like the triangle, the weak sounding maracas do not interest him (by weak I mean they make very little noise), nor does the clacker. Even worse, the cymbals, an instrument he loves to bang at his pre-school, are too small to make any real noise! The sound of the cymbals is flat and dull, which prompts our little boy to complain ""too small, daddy, too small.""Even worse, as many (too many -- are you listening, M&D;?) reviewers have noted over the years here, the tambourine head broke immediately.I probably would not get this again if I had to do it over."
1,"Who writes this stuff, and why is it so popular?","What I learned from this episode:1. If you're having premarital sex, you're not a christian2. If you're a christian, you're ashamed of your natural sexual urges3. If you're a *good* christian, you don't have any sexual urges.4. No one masturbates. Ever.5. Abortions are unspeakable.6. Guidance counselors can refuse to give condoms to students (wtf??!)I sincerely hope there's more to this show than some messed up contradictory right wing religious propaganda. It's just the first episode... but I've seen a couple others and I think it's from the creators of 7th Heaven, so... Yeah.7th Heaven was the first show of my childhood that I recognized as bad writing. I even tried to like it because my friends did, but it was always just awkward and unrealistic dialog. Even when I was in elementary school."
2,New hampshire Fishing Maps,"A so-so reference book. The maps can be inaccurate when it comes to location of ramps and roads. The text is good but the updated version varies little from the orginal. A good book for the price, but there are better ones out there, ie. Clark's fishing guide."
3,Wish it worked better,"I was so thrilled when I found this product, but after two months it seems to be on the verge of breaking. The piece that clips into the phone no longer clicks in properly, so at the slightest jar it comes out. Also, the ability to use a phone headset with this product never seemed to work quite well, and I'd lose that connection while in the midst of a conversation. Overall, I am still able to use the product, and when it works it's great. But it has its flaws. I think the best deal is to get a wireless phone with the built-in speaker phone."
2,"Big, clunky, poor fit","I have a Nokie 5165 and the charging station doesn't hold it well at all--the slightest bump or tap and the phone slides right out. And the cord that connects to the phone is heavy and bulky. Nope, don't like this item at all."
4,Great Bargain,I'm giving my review because I did a bit of research before buying these speakers. I would recommend them to others wanting some weather proof patio speakers with lots of punch. Great bargain for the performance and price.
2,Excellent selection of music is marred,Excellent selection of music is marred by short length (42:29) and lack of any information about the music or the artists. The recording date and number of weeks in the top 40 isn't even provided. If a CD is to take up valuable shelf space then it has to be more than this. This is the problem with the entire Chart Toppers series.
4,An excellent book that is hard to put down! :-),"I absolutely loved this book and all the other sequels! Sue Harrison made reading it an adventure, and you actually felt like you were there with the characters. It had a great plot that thickened as each book went by. I felt like I was actually a member of the town by the last page! The love story between Kiin and Qakan gave it a romantic twist! It also made me appreciate the way of life I have. Some other good authors are Sue Harrison, Linda Lay Shuler, and Lucia St.Clair Robson. :-)"
1,Bland,"Once I heard that ex-Metallica bassist Jason Newsted was starting a new band, I was thrilled; then I bought the CD.The CD is tampered with not-so good alternative rock/pop songs that seem to not have any backbone or meaning to them. Since when did rock'n'roll not mean anything? It seems like bands today just copy styles, and they are all just boring re-makes.That is exactly what Echobrain is; trying to copy the success of bands such as: Goo Goo Dolls, Third Eye Blind, and Matchbox 20, with dismal effects. This record cheats out real rock fans and should dissapoint Metallica fans."
5,a great book that tell how serious eating disordrs are,This book was a great book that shows you the fights and the struggles of a younge girl who has Anorexia Nervosa. She nearly dies and pulls through many weaknesses. A great inspiring book for any reader.
5,Everything you will ever need to know when it comes to being,This book will teach you how to become the fittest you have ever been in your life. It has pictures and a discription of how each exercise is done. At the back it has programs to follow which incorporates all the exercise and skills you have learned. A must buy if you are wanting to go BUD/S or if you want to become very fit.
2,Old material,"Looks like the book was from he 60's, while the information was relevant then many changes in training have taken place since the book was made"
3,Overall a good book but...,"This book does the best job of presenting the various common military calisthenics that I've seen. However, before rushing out to buy this book, people should know that 75% of the information can be obtained directly from the official BUD/S website for FREE. The majority of the workout in this book is known as the ""BUD/S Warning Order."" Only Phase 3 seems to come from Mr. Chalker. Basically, this is the Warning Order with Mr. Chalkers own recomendations. Thus, I gave it only 3 stars."
3,More than the BUD/s warning order.,"I think that it's kind of funny that most of these Navy SEAL/Marine/ Ranger and Firefighter workout guides, basically spend 75% diagramming exercises, 15% giving an introduction to the SEALs, Marines etc, and 10% with actual workout plans.Unlike similar books, THE UNITED STATE'S NAVY SEALS WORKOUT GUIDE goes beyond the BUD/S warning order, which is available free on the internet. This book includes a third phase ""Schedule III"" which is the best part of this book. I'm not interested in going to BUD/S, but if you can complete the ""Schedule III"" workouts, you should be good to go.This is the best book I know of if you are considering BUD/S or any military service, but it's not really for the average citizen just looking to get in shape. If you are more interested in just achieving a high level of fitness, I would recommend Stewart Smith's MAXIMUM FITNESS: THE COMPLETE GUIDE TO NAVY SEAL CROSS TRAINING."
1,it doesn't work at all,i've been testing it for 1 week and this product is not bringing good results. it just doesn't work. it doesn't recharge anything. i think i'll return it if it keep not working!is very big!
1,"Can't get it to work properly for laptop, limited use for iPod","The word ""laptop"" in the product description may be deceptive. This unit died when attached to a small laptop. It is able to partially charge an iPod through one of two USB ports, after long periods of time charging itself. A year ago, I purchased a Black & Decker car starting batter pack that also was DOA. Obviously, I'm avoiding this brand from now on."
2,DOA,"I was looking for a way to recharge my music player and laptop for a flight to and back from Hawaii. I did not realize I was getting something so large and heavy, but I figured it would do the job. Unfortunately, even after 48 hours on charge, the battery remained dead. I gave it two stars mostly out of hope, but partly because the Black and Decker customer service seems to have their act together. Even so, Black and Decker would not help because I bought it through Amazon and it was within the 30 day return window. Amazon would not replace the unit because it is sold by a partner company. So I returned it (easy process - nice). The date code on the unit said 2007, making me think that I was delivered a 3 year old product and wondering how long these things will last.I am planning on trying again, but am not holding out too much hope that I won't again get an old unit that won't work or will fail within a year or two."
1,Have all three models - All three are failing,I own all three B&D the 10W the 16W and 100W - The bigger the shorter the Life - Also missing my Power Supply for the 100W if anyone can tell me the volt and amps on theirs I'd appreciate it so i can find a replacement. I recelled the 18W with new batteries and its working again for how long who knows. This is a great product Idea just a poor implementation.
4,"Could have been 5 stars, except...","for the annoying tags. The first time I borrowed this video from our local library, my son LOVED it. He loved it so much we purchased it from Amazon. The only thing that is really annoying on this DVD is that between EVERY song there is a Baby Boost promo and between EVERY TWO songs there is a Baby Boost and Select on Demand promo. It gets very annoying at first and then, for the most part, I learned to tune it out. But, really, when they made the DVD they could have eliminated those tags. Also, the music CD that comes with the DVD, does not have all the songs from the DVD. It just has about twelve of them done twice, once with kids singing and once with just the music. He still listens to the CD and enjoys it nonetheless."
2,Logos,"The CD Is ok. The DVD seems to be recorded in the 80's. Plus, there is this annoying logo. Between every song the company logo is there. Plus, I didn't think the DVD was attractive enough to my 1omyhs old baby. Sorry..."
3,"A tight interpretation, but it's missing something","Levi's interpretation of Mahler's darkest symphony has much to recommend it, especially the soulful reading of the slow movement and a finale rendered and sharp and clear as possible. But omitting the first-movement repeat, for whatever reason, is unacceptable. Mahler structured this movement in modified sonata form. The repeat makes that clear. So, Levi's recording has to take a back seat to Karajan and Bernstein (and, in a chamberlike vein, Levine), I'm afraid."
1,Disappointed,"The gun works great, but the slide motor quit working within a few minutes. I have a friend who bought the same product for Christmas for their son, and it didn't work either!Do not buy this until they work out the bugs!I would not recommend this product."
4,Comparable,After 5 years it was time to replace the unrechargeble batteries.At a savings of $3.00 for 1 battery I bought at Amazon.
3,Lasted half the summer then faded and eventually rusted out,Very cute cheap lawn ornament. It never actually spun like it states but I didn't mind as I knew I just wanted something colorful and low cost to place in my garden. The item last about half of the summer before it completely faded and then rusted and fell over. For the price I may purchase again in the future it did it's job for the price I paid.
5,Great Book,This is a great book. I enjoyed reading it very much. Heidi Fleiss is an incredible talent. Her ability to bring people together and to create such an exciting life style is an inspiration. She understands what we all know--sex sells.
5,Pandering,"Product game just as described, if not in better condition. Loved the layout and originality of the book and raw reality of her life."
4,Very interesting,"Amazon prime is great, I wanted to watch something about John Wayne Gacy, and they had it. Well made documentary."
1,Too much politics and not enough Reagan in Private,"I've only made it to Chapter five and I have read nothing but politics, politics, politics. 'Hardly a word about the man Ronald Reagan, of whom the book is ostensibly about. James Kuhn seems to be too preoccupied about what HE has done on these campaigns and has hardly mentioned Ronald Reagan the man. Too boring for me. I can't read it anymore. I highly recommend Peggy Noonan's book ""When Character was King: A Story of Ronald Reagan"". It really does give you insight on the man."
4,delightful portrait of a great man,"This truly enjoyable book about Ronald Reagan is of the type, and should be considered a companion to, the late Mike Deaver's book, A Different Drummer (for which see my review). These books complement the scholarly tomes--important as those are--with honest appraisals of the humanity of our 40th president. Along the way, they also confirm what recent scholarship has discovered--that despite unfair portrayals by his enemies and the media, Reagan worked hard, hardly ever napped, was widely read, and was brilliant at processing and distilling information. Kuhn's book adds necessary color about the personalities in the Reagan White House, for which historians will be grateful. Highly recommended."
1,Hawaii in slow motion!,"This is painful to watch, it is so slow you could go to sleep. Waste of money!"
1,Pretty useless,"Anyone looking for a view of what Hawaii is really like should keep looking. The 5.1 sound is pretty nice but the picture is blurry and soft and isn't much more than a couple of beach shots. Also, I had a problem getting it to even play. I kept getting HDMI error, which has never happened with any other disc. Once I switched to 720p I was able to get it to work."
2,Nice photos but not the feeling you have been there !!,The product is not worth much it will be better suited as a gift with some other productOnly 1080i I am dissapointedChristos
2,"beware ""hd window"" blu-rays","this is essentially a ""video post card"" with essentially still images floating on-screen for 3-5 minutes at a time, with cheesy background music (sort of like ""muzak"") floating in the background...there HAVE to be better ideas and formats for viewing hawaii...certainly narration describing what we are seeing may not have been a bad idea..."
5,Polaroids: A Greatest Hits Collection (Shawn Colvin),"A great collection of fine tunes, with the unique style and arrangements of Shawn Colvin. You wouldn't mistake her for anyone else. Some of the material reminds one of more recent work by Joni Mitchell. This might be due to the musical influence of Larry Klein who has worked with both artists and is featured on some tracks of this recording. A particular treat is Shawn's rendition of Lennon & McCartney's ""I'll Be Back"". Its hauntingly beautiful and simple guitar work, and a slower tempo than the Beatles' original version allow the listener to savor the lyrics, as only Shawn Colvin can so sweetly and heart-breakingly deliver them. This is a very good recording and certainly a must for the collection of any true Shawn Colvin fan."
3,"Good for Your Little ""Screamers""","If you are a SpongeBob fan, these spongebob videos are good to buy. Each game pak has 45 minutes (3 episodes) of Spongebob. There are 3 different volumes (12 episodes from season 1 and 2) in all. The video quality is something you would find on YouTube, not bad, not excellent, but good enough. I best advise this to buy if you have small kids. If your on a airplane or a car trip, you can show them one of the videos to make them stop bothering you. They probably already seen the episode on television before, but they will watch it over again anyway."
5,The Best Yet!,"I've been a seeker for my entire adult life, reading everything in the personal development genre I could find. In addition I've done a lot different ""trainings"", so I feel pretty versed in what works and what does not.You must read this book! I cannot believe Lester Levenson and Hale Dwoskin are not household names already, and I'm sure they will be when this gets around. This book is both masterful and profound. Anyone who reads and applies the simple, yet powerful exercises cannot help but feel lighter and happier.Thank you! Thank you! Thank you!"
5,"THIS REALLY, REALLY WORKS!!!","We all want life to be easy, simply and happy and yet we resist when things appear to be ""too easy or to good to be true."" The method offered in Happiness Is Free and It's Easier than You Think"" is easy, simply and extremely effective. I know. I have used it nearly every day for things like stress, anxiety, anger, even headaches! In less than a minute I walk myself through the steps outlined in this book and VOILA! issues and problems disappear or at least become very manageable. I highly recommned this book."
5,Good for every day,I use this every day because I love real lavender (as opposed to the synthetic kind). It's not an overwhelming smell that you get sick of. And the oil is absorbed quickly.
5,Great DVD,This is a great DVD. The ability to switch camera angles is really cool. It's to bad that Jimi is no longer alive.
4,"Not his best work, but still better than so many others","Production quality isnt awesome, and Jimi isn't totally on top of his game. Maybe not the best place to get your feet wet with Hendrix. However, a must have for those who appreciate/love Hendrix's music. I only gave it four stars because I am comparing it with his best studio/live albums. That being said, having the chance to watch the best ever perform at a little less than his best is still better than almost anything else out there today. If you do purchase you won't be disappointed. If you are disappointed then you're probably just an unhappy person."
3,good for a small room,"this cable is very good for a small room. i have a set of speakers in my bedroom they go to an older sony amplifier and the rca to rca is connected to the sound output of my comcast cable box, so i get better than from my tv sound"
2,should we start rounding up Catholics?,"I understand that once an author completes a work, it's not his anymore: we can bring whatever we want to it, and take whatever we want from it. Having said that, I still think this movie is a travesty--an anti-Catholic diatribe that even a lapsed Catholic like me found disturbing. It almost made me want to start attending mass again. Almost. Believe me, when Charles Ryder's widowed father becomes the only breath of fresh air, you know the movie has problems. Yes, I was spoiled by the serialized version of the eighties, but I was also spoiled by reading the book--something that the creators of this film apparently chose not to do."
2,Classic reverence,"A somewhat slow and at times self-conscious interpretation of a great classic. Life was not totally bleak in those days as everyone 'made the best of things', to make the depressing palatable."
1,Why?,The Granada TV series with Jeremy Irons is a riveting masterpiece. So why this remake? Emma Thompson and Michael Gambon are out of place in this decidedly amateurish and pathetic remake. So many of the richly portrayed characters from the TV series are missing. This is rather like the Chipmunks doing Miles Davis.
5,Country Line Dance,"In December 2003 we choreographed a line dance to GOOD LITTLE GIRLS, you can find it at www.kickit.to. Since then many of the instructors from the States contacted us about our dance - it's a great feeling to know, that they like the song and the dance. Now, the CD is published and this great song is on it (track 1). I hope you'll get a look at our dance sometime.Greetings from Switzerland"
1,Awful,"I woke up this morning to the grating sounds of ""Good Little Girls"" blaring over my clock radio's single, worn-out speaker. A speaker that has helped introduce some great songs over the past year, such as ""There Goes My Life"" and ""Live Like You Were Dying"". ""Good Little Girls"" is easily the worst country song I've ever heard - and I thought Neal McCoy was bad! Blue Country is the C&W; equivalent of Wham! (a dated reference to be sure)Maybe I'm just getting too old for country music?"
1,Deception,"The title for this e-book is deceptive. I bought it thinking it was the book. The word review in parathesis made me think I could click that on to get a review. This is not a book, it is just a review of the book. I would like my money back."
3,Overkill!!!,But still a fun little gun. It REALLY doesn't need all the peripherals... it's fine with just the silencer.
4,Faulkner would turn in his grave,"if he knew what Rice was doing with his ""Cady,"" the family, and the literary legacy. He'd probbaly turn in his grave with delight. Rice says this book was almost impossible to write -- maybe he shouldn't have written it. It's pretty unreadable, like language poetry, but I give him three stars for some damn fine images and perverse sexual longings.This isn't a novel. It's more like a prose poem. I've read some other works by Rice in literary zines and he's getting more and more obscure, and writing about the same characters in this book.The photos are a nice touch.Whatever this thing is, it's worth a try."
2,Not water resistant,"I purchased this watch for my 8 year old daughter as Christmas Gift. It stopped working exactly three weeks later. She swims 4 hours a week and after three weeks the strap lost its color and became gray. Although I suspected that may happen I didn't expect for water resistant watch to collect water inside (there are water droplets under 'glass'). Water resistance was a main reason for choosing the watch, therefore I am very disappointed (and my daughter even more)."
3,It Ok watch not the best...,I got this watch for my 3 yr. old daughter. It is not the best watch but it is fine for a 3 yr. old kid.
3,Good one,We presented this to few kids and they like it very much and even they start using the very next day onwardsGood for small kids around 8 to 10ThanksKarthik
4,Excellent - still,"Needed a good, sturdy non-stick skillet. This fits the bill very well, and is deep enough for stir-frying as well as sauteing. Purchased a replacement skillet in spring of 2012 as non-stick coating was starting to fray; however, really like the way it treats food. If I have to replace it every 2 years, that's fine."
4,Not For The Faint of Hearing,"Skipping all the flowery rhetoric of the previous reviewer, this is one very strange listening experience; very much akin to the darker side of Trent Reznor, Pendretsky(sp?) or some Indie horror film.While there are no lyrics or vocals as such, the fragmentary snatches of human voices and (occasional) chorus, combined with the shifting sonic backdrops produces an odd sense of hearing ""something"" -but you're never quite sure what.There is noting overtly ""scary"" or ""frightening"" in this composition, though the absence of familiar setting and style serves to disorient; the aural soundscapes are unsettling and the cumulative effect is nothing less than disturbing.Something to listen to on Halloween? Yes."
3,"Great service, title misleading.","Thanks for the wonderful service! I am very happy to have so many beloved old tv shows available to me. This dvd, however, calls itself fan favorites, which made me think it might have some of my favorite episodes. In fact it is only a few episodes from season 3, which I already have. Not the seller's fault, but for future customers, that's all it is."
4,A wonderful source and guide,"I bought this book a month ago and am beginning to wonder how I lived without it. This book outlines everything that could ever concern a woman, from skin care to infertility to weight loss to cancer. It is a simple guide to women's health and offers not only traditional ""medical"" advice, but also offers alternative therapys for most common health problems. This is something that I will have with me and refer to for the rest of my life."
2,Apparently there are no parallel sayings...,"I bought this for a friend, but snuck a peek when it arrived at mine. As it turns out none of the saying are parallel in meaning, John and Grouch do however seem to know a lot of the same words. The selections seem to be based on quotes where both men use one or more of the same word(s) in a sentence. I think somebody got stoned and decided to write a book about their two favorite people. Nice for a good laugh, but probably not what you're expecting."
1,this is not a sunscreen,"Although the texture is fabulous there does not appear to be any actual sunscreen in this product. I have used this line of products for 2 years and love them. However, this is terrible."
4,What you see is what you get...,"Be forewarned, the product description lists items that are not included. What you see in the picture is all you get. A car charger adapter with built in hands-free kit, no visor microphone or mounting brackets. I really didn't care since I was looking into this mainly for use as a car charger. The speaker is built into the charger and the microphone is located near the phone adapter. The unit is plenty loud, has a volume control, and works as intended, but mounting brackets and a visor microphone would enhance it's ease of use. Without those items, it is very similar to a standard car charger and requires you to place the phone on the passenger seat or center console. Also, an additional antenna was not required for the unit to operate."
2,Um... not so much.,"I like the music of 2002 and when I bought the DVD and CD I should have read the packaging more closely. I thought I was getting actual movement on the DVD rather than a slideshow to their music. Heck... I could have done that myself with photographs I already have. I was kinda' bummed about this. The music is great though. Had I to do it over again, I would have only spent the money on the CD rather than the combo package."
5,Understand The Intent of this Book,"This is not an all encompassing work on every aspect of pitching a baseball up to World Series level. It isn't intended to be, and the foreward expressly states that. This is a book for the parent of an 8, 9, or 10 year old who shows interest and potential to be a pitcher, and in that context it's gonna be real hard to do better than this. There is information that can help you, and your child, up toward age 14 or maybe more, but the primary focus is on safe, correct, basic pitching technique and exercise. If you don't know anything about pitching you need this book, but if you THINK you know something about pitching you should buy 2, one for the player so you won't cripple his arm before he's old enough to shave. That could have read ""shave her legs"". Girls pitch, too. It says so right in the book."
5,Outstanding training guide for young pitchers...,"I started coaching baseball (8-11 year olds) and was at a definite disadvantage to teach my strong throwers the mechanics of pitching. This book fit the bill - it is simple, elegant, informed and provides useful diagrams and illustrations. I have read a number of books on coaching in the past few months...and this one was perhaps the most useful. I encourage coaches to acquire it, and it is also just what it says - a great guide for parents of youth who aspire to pitch."
4,An Appropriate Finale Though It Was a Bit Too Detailed at Times,"This was the fourth and final book in Updike's Rabbit series, and the 2nd of the series to win the Pulitzer. While I did love this book, it was definitely not the best of the series. One of the things I love about Updike is his attention to detail and the richness he brings to characters and situations but he went a little overboard in this book. It seemed that he'd done an awful lot of research for the series and wanted to make sure to jam all that remained into the last book.That said, it was still excellent. I haven't been huge into series in the past, but this was definitely a series that I am sad to see end. Rabbit was a rich character and it was really interesting to follow his life for 40 years, in 10 year increments."
2,Over 400 pages of some fat middle aged guy dying,"I enjoyed ""Rabbit is Rich"" but this one was a drag. Rabbit is obese and doesn't exercise. He has the inevitable heart attack. In nerve deadening detail, the reader learns about his hospitalization and watches him die. Sounds cheery, right? I cannot believe that anyone would spend a year or more writing such a novel. Who was he writing for? Anyone who has ever had a family member get sick will find nothing new in here that he/she has not experienced in their own life. There are no insights here to make it all worthwhile as Rabbit and his family are not especially thoughtful people, so we learn nothing new about mortality and sickness. Updike writes well but this is totally lacking in the humour and sly observations about middle class life which made ""Rabbit is Rich"" such a good read."
1,horrible,"i bought it for my printer but every one minute of printing it stops working , i thought that the problem in my printer as it was new , i was about to return my printer but i had to try another cable first, it worked great then, i couldnt believe that this stubid little thing ruined two days in my life"
2,"Cheap, almost functional","""USB Device not recognized"" is more common than an actual connection with this cable, but it is not nearly as common as a complete lack of any communication at all. On the rare occasions that it actually works, though, it works fine."
5,Gets the job done,This cable is the right price and gets the job done. Highly recommnded if you need a long USB cable.
2,Not what I expected,"I bought this at the same time I purchased a Cables to Go 7 port USB 2.0 Hub. Unfortunately, the products aren't compatible. I wonder if others found the same problem b/c Amazon's site suggests that a lot of people purchased both at the same time. I did send an email to Cables to Go and they responded pretty quickly w/ the type of cable I'd need to buy. I don't think returning the one I bought would be worth the S&H though."
3,50% success rate,"Cables super inexpensive. One worked, one didn't. Didn't bother with returns because process is a bit complicated - not stocked by Amazon but rather a 3rd party. The one that worked works great. Not too disappointed considering they cost $3 a piece including shipping"
1,Printer USB Cable,"USB did not work, it was not a recognizable USB. The seller gave me a credit on my account & did not require me to return item, so I threw it away."
1,"Bought 3, all 3 are bad","I bought these to use as printer cables. I plugged this cable into a brand new HP OfficeJet 6500A AiO printer. Prints ok, but refuses to scan. I try a different brand 6' cable. Everything works fine. I try the other 2 Cables To Go 13400's that I bought. Exactly the same failure."
1,You get what you pay for,"I bought this thinking ""what the heck, how bad can a cheap cable be?"". The cable worked for about 5 days, then suddenly didn't. Sure, I could send it back or request a new one, but for what I paid, it wouldn't be worth my time. You get what you pay for."
3,"Knee pads, elbow pads",These work pretty well. My only complaint is that they are a little big for my petite daughter. Especially the knee pads. She really have to tighten them down to keep them in place.
2,Not Great,For the price I paid for this book I expected it to be excellent. Unfortunately the photos are grainy due to poor paper quality. I took a chance having not seen one before. Oh well.
2,It Gurgles,"I actually did not buy this. This model was given to me by Hunter as a replacement when I bought another(smaller)Hunter humidifier that malfunctioned. It was fine the first week or two, and although it wasn't absolutely quiet, the noise to me was bearable. Until it started gurgling. Now everytime I turn it on it has an annoying gurgling sound that does not go away, regardless of high or low setting. Other than that it does it's job and humidifies my room just fine.Update* I have tossed this humidifier to the trash. After using this for a few months it now started to leak copius amounts of water on my carpet. I do not reccommend this humidifier."
1,smells horrendous,"about 2 months after we purchased this humidifier, it started to smell awful. We soaked the ""care free"" filter in lysol to try to kill whatever it was that was growing in it; didnt work. still stinks. If ""care free"" means cleaning it with a toothbrush and it still stinks, then care free it is. I would probably burn this if I couldn't take it back so that no one else would try to use it. don't buy it. god only knows what kind of cooties it's aerosolizing into our bedroom. It's a health hazard waiting to happen. I would give it negative 5 stars."
1,Terrible piece of junk,"This humidifier is a great waste of money. If you're looking for a humidifier that is expensive, not ""care-free"", and very loud this is the one for you. It is a disgusting, bacteria breeding cess pool. If you already own this model, don't even attempt to keep up with the cleaning of it. Your efforts are futile unless you find yourself soothed to sleep by watching of illuminated bacteria and microbes swimming about with the help of the ""night-glo"" nightlight feature. Throw this piece of junk away before it kills you and your family with a bacterial infection. If you are in the market for a quality humidifier please consider selling your first born before even entertaining the thought of purchasing this horribly designed excuse for a humidifier."
2,"Hunter Care Free, It Died","After two short winter seasons, which included ""as perscribed"" cleaning practices, the motor died. The warrantee, according to the vendor, is one year so ""your out of luck""."
5,"Had it for 2 years, still runs like new","I'm surprised at so many negative reviews. I've had it for 2 years and it still runs like new. I've cleaned it after each winters use. Yes, it is a little loud but my husband snores so I like to use the humidifier on High Speed!"
1,"Junk, junk, junk",This is the third Hunter we've owned (our mistake). All of ours end up spewing water after just a few months and even dump the entire contents onto our floor in the middle of the night. Nice to have to clean up first thing in the morning. We've grown worried that either our floor is going to soon rot out or the thing is going to cause an electrical fire. No thanks on another one. Spend more money for something that WORKS.
5,deck recliner,"One of the most comfortable things I've ever sat in. Well made, says on instructions should not be left out in rain, no problem it folds and unfolds in a second and is very light. It's so comfortable I might get one for my living room (no wife to comp0lain about decor)"
5,La Evolución de FEY,"Después de 3 años de espera, FEY vuelve con Vértigo, este disco tiene la influencia de la música electrónica europea, y letras de la misma inspiración de FEY.En Vértigo podemos encontrar de todo tipo de ritmos.Bailables (Loca Por Amarte/Ambition, Dime/Show Me)Baladas (Romeo & Juliet, Siento Caer/Follow me Down, Vertigo)Estos son algunos ejemplos, FEY vuelve con este disco que será su despegue al mercado internacional."
1,SERIOUSLY????,So instead of just releasing season 3 SONY will go to all the trouble to release this new DVD with the same episodes as seasons 1 and 2. WHY???? HELLO-to all you corporate big wigs that make all the decisions start reading the CUSTOMER'S reviews. Maybe you'll learn something. Die hard fans want the rest of this series. So put it out!!!! Guess what-you'll make money and have happy customers. Now you just have pissed off customers that wont buy this dvd that is just a rehash of the first 2 seasons we already own....you suck
4,"Very Convenient , But the Quality Takes a Hit","Good:This cartridge has 3 Fairy Odd Parents episodes, one that is double length, which rounds out to be about 45 minutes of video. You can pause, fast forward, rewind, and skip scenes. You even adjust the brightness of the video, which is a nice touch. The menu's and interface is very slick too, and since this is a GBA cartridge you'll be able to watch these episodes anywhere! I also got this for only $2, which is totally worth it.Bad:It only has three episodes, so if you don't like one of them it may not be worth it. The real killer though is the quality of the sound and picture. At some spaces the color is all wrong, small objects become lumpy and overall it definitely leaves something to be desired.Overall:Good: Slick menus, many options, portabilityBad: Only 3 episodes, sound and audio quality is so-so"
1,NOT Asian Recipes,"I was stunned when I got this cookbook and went through it. Despite the title and the authors ethnicity, there are maybe 10 Asian recipes in this book, and those are basic recipes you could find in any veggie cookbook (miso soup, fried rice, etc.). The bulk of the recipes in this book are basic standby's found in almost any begining veg cookbook....lasgna, pizza, chili, guacamole, mushroom barley soup, blueberry muffins, tofu scramble. The back flap says the recipes are simple and quick...and they aren't kidding, these are very basic and simple recipes. Too simple and too generalized for my tastes and cooking skill."
1,"JVC 52"" D-ILA STINKS!!","Dear potential ConsumersI have had the JVC 52"" DILA for 3 months. This TV is worste than the cheapest 19"" tv out there. I was fooled at Best Buy when I went to look at it. It *SEEMED* sharp, it *SEEMED* reliable, it *SEEMED* like a dream come true. It rurned out to be a nightmare. One night as i was giving my fiance a facial, I heard the TV make a zap sound and that was the last of it.I called Best Buy (because I had their service plan) and I called JVC and the turn around time to have someone come out to *TAKE* a look at it was 3 days! I did not spend this much money to have to go and watch my old small tv in my bedroom.I hope everyone understands that I am not exaggerating. The TV does have great picture quality but it you can tell there are severe electrical problems with it. 1 month after getting my TV i received a letter from JVC warning me that some of their 52"" DILA models have caught fire.My advice, shop around some more.. don't stop here and get this TV. It sucks!"
5,Inspirational,"I do not know how this work could be rated less than 5 stars. His duets with various artist add interesting variations for those who do not like to listen to straight opera, yet appreciate the quality of Pavarotti.There is a wide selection on You tube for viewing and listening pleasure."
4,Pavarottie & Friends,"Before I purchased the above product I listened to some of the songs via Amazon and tried to purchase the product here in Australia, but it was not available at the time. Before Pavarotti died there were plans for another charity concert which I was looking forward to viewing hopefully on TV, unfortunately he died before fulfilling his plans, which prompted me to buy his collection of concerts and I am thrilled with my purchase"
2,Playing Pieces too large for board .,"The playing peices for this Star Wars Chess set are cool to look at but they are too large and awkward to move about the board. It is also a bit challenging to figure out which piece is a pawn, horse, queen..etc. I bought this for my son who knew the basics of chess and he can play it, but I'd say it is more suited for ""Cool"" effect then to play with. The board is just made of basic flimsy cardboard so it does not match the uniqueness of the pieces ( if you are looking to buy something for a Star Wars fan for novelty value then it is okay)."
3,its short,"Description of product said it was latex, i dont think so. On the other side, its short to cover all abdomen like in the picture. Fabric make it more wide but not more long as it has to be."
2,Mediocre price for a cheap product,"I've purchased this product because I purchased a large size and it wasn't tight enough for me. I read some of the reviewers said this product helped their tummy to go back to their pre-pregnancy state....But that wasn't the case with me.Because this product comes with only one size if your tummy does shrink, you have to purchase a smaller size. And if your size is in between the size, this product do not shape your tummy. I am in between large and medium and when I wear the medium, this thing rides up and scrunches all my tummy fats to the front as it pinches my side, then it folds in between my upper and lower tummy to make me look fat. I'm sorry, but I thought the purpose of wearing this product was to make me look slimmer.Do not get this product if you know your tummy size will shrink dramatically. Only because you may be forced to purchase a smaller size that may not even fit right for you."
4,Decent waist trimmer,"I purchased this, obviously to trim a bit off of my waistline. I guess I needed to order a size up bc it made me look like I was pregnant! The only plus side was that it helped to support my back."
2,Instant slimmer not what I was looking for,"Unfortunately, I sent the product back. It did slim me in my mid-section, but I didn't like the ""buldge"" it left on top - which could be seen through sweaters or blouses. I am not over-weight, just need a little tummy control."
3,Inches off?,"This for me, had the effect of wearing control top pantyhose pulled all the way up. I do like that it covers from bust to past the muffin top area and that it does not roll down. However, I was looking for something that would nip my midsection in a little more. I have a 28"" waist and I bought the medium so it wouldn't roll down as other reviewers recommended, but it honestly didn't do that much. Maybe I should have bought the small."
5,Get your size!,"I bought a medium and should have bought a large, but I didn't want to admit I needed a large. lol.... It fits well, doesn't roll down and I wear it all the time under my clothes."
4,Slimming but somewhat stiff,"This product is very slimming and does its job, however, is somewhat uncomfortable when sitting down. I would definitely recommend the product though to decrease the muffin top effect."
3,Nice but little uncomfortable,"I bought black and white each. The material is nice but it hurts me around my rip cage area. I stopped wearing it after 2 days. Plus, my waist looks slimmer without it...LOL"
5,Best of its Kind,"Bolker's approach is tailored specifically for writers and those who want to write. She hits all the difficult issues, offers many perspectives, and overall encourages and supports the serious writer. This is a book to pick up if you want to write, and a book to consult whenever you have trouble writing. Having worked for years as a psychological counselor for blocked writers, Bolker knows her topic and shares her insight. This collection is, imho, the best of its kind."
5,Great Pan!,Excellent quality skillet. Non-stick surface does an exceptional job just don't use HIGH heat. Time will tell as to how scratch proof the non-stick coating is.
3,Eh ..,"It can sure pick up the dust bunnies and hair. I have handplaned hardwood and the ball seems to have a little problem with the 'wavy' surface and seams which are more pronounced than flat hardwood. My floor was put down on concrete and like most concrete slabs is not perfectly flat--this causes some further trouble for the little guy.Over all my new pet does help keep a jump on the dust and animal hair. It is a favorite toy of our cats, but it is more than an expensive cat toy--it does do some work and is helpful.I do wish I'd have gotten one of the Roomba machines, but for an inexpensive bit of help, this is fine for now."
3,GREAT~!!!! But.......,"I just got this item, and tried it out. WOW.....Works GREAT~! LOL~!!!! It is cheap plastic made in China gadget, but indeed cute little robot that does a work. Only down side is.....WHERE can I get a Refill Pads?? 48 Free Redemption??? The web site, phone number does not seems to exist. Whats up with that?? So, it only gets 3 stars. NOT FOR CARPET FLOOR, HARD FLOOR ONLY."
2,beautiful but deadly to china,"This flat ware is beautiful to look at but, contrary to the advertisement that it's dishwasher safe, the box says to hand wash. Additionally, the knives are serrated, which means that they cut into the glaze on your china. I sent them back after discovering these problems."
2,worth the price?,"It's a very nicely finished, compact, convenient, durable, useful tool. I'd probably give it raves if it was made in USA (as I think it used to be). Seriously, I walk past lights nearly as nice as this for under $10 at every tool or hardware store. I bought this to replace another flashlight / laser I had and lost, which I paid $10 or less for, but isn't carried by the local place anymore.Of course this metal light won't float either."
4,Everybody's jealous of my Streamlight!,"I use this flashlight on a daily basis at a construction site, so the flashlight gets its share of abuse.With one click, the laser pointer is activated. Click the button again and the 5 LEDs put out enough light to see into the building's nooks and crannies, even when I'm standing on the floor and looking up at something near the ceiling, some 16 feet up. A third click turns on the small incandescent bulb and the laser pointer, which comes in handy when I'm pointing out something in a darkened area. It came with a nylon holster featuring a belt loop, so it's always at hand. Its compact size allows it to sit at my waist without being obtrusive.The only negative aspect I've found with the product is that AAA batteries don't last all that long, but I happily make the trade-off for the features offered. Guys on the construction site admire my Streamlight, and I'm glad I've got it."
1,WARNING. Do Not Purchase,"Do not purchase this game. Turbine, the game producer, is closing this game down. You will not - I repeat not - be able to play it. Asheron's Call 2 : Legions is an MMORPG and is unplayable once the servers go down.Just a side note, Turbine released this expansion pack, took everyone's money, and then shut the game down. On purpose, mind you. They were gathering funds for two other products. You are warned. Be careful when purchasing the company's new products: Dungeons and Dragons Online, and Middle Earth.As for me, I am staying away from Turbine. Shady business practives."
5,You should make great photos with this book.,"This is a good book with some good tips on using a Large Format camera for nature shots. I also bought the book Using The View Camera by Steve Simmons. I notice in this book that he recommends glass filters where as Simmon's suggests gelatin ones. I wouldn't suggest this book as your first large format book because he doesn't tell you how to use one, you should already know by the time you read this. If you are interested in LF or thinking of getting one, this is one of those books you can read rather than watching that stupid television. It will inspire you to get out there and use your camera."
4,Must Read but not Great,Jack Dykinga has written this book in friendly and flowing language. He discusses practial problems faced by landscape photographers and solutions to those problems.Photography techniques has not been discussed much as book is targetted at LF photographers. They usually know their stuff.It is not complete guide kind of book yet discuss all aspect of photography and provide useful tip about them.Jack makes taking these wonderful photographs look easy. This develops confident in reader not to get intimidated by stunning landscape photos in books. And try making those high quality photographs.All in all a must read and keeper.
1,Definitely NOT Floored!,"As a connoisseur of lesbian love stories, please do not waste your time with Floored by Love. I only leave reviews of movies that are so painfully awful to sit through --I feel compelled to do my fellow sisters the service of sharing with them how incredibly bad this movie was. Storyline was cliche'. Acting was horrible! No LOVE connection happening at all between the central characters. For it to be only 45 minutes in length --I wasn't sure if I was going to get through it. It was one of those movies that hits you over the head at the end and begs why did you even bother? I don't know how they ever found a distributor. If you want moving, quality lesbian love stories try: When Night Is Falling, Fire, High Art, Desert Hearts, Loving Annabelle, Aimee & Jaguar, A Girl Thing, or Tipping the Velvet to name a few. Floored by Love will leave you wanting to throw the DVD out of your car window and reverse over it a few times!"
4,Nice Book,"It was a pretty good book, but I feel the author missed a number of opportunities to argue important points. While I share the opinion of the author, I don't think the book was particularly convincing."
2,EBIGFY review,he did a good job explaining the complexity of popular culture but did not provide enough evidence to why it is making us smarter
2,Interesting but choppy,"Interesting, food for thought, hard to get into and not so convincing after all. Could be a much shorter book."
4,Fun thought provoking read: many brilliant ideas,"I think it is a very unique compilation of ideas that are fun to think about. I liked the part about video games and litaracy/reading early on in the book - as well as many other novel thoughts. The book does a good job in considering how ""video games"" and moder TV actually are more intellectually challenging than in the past, hence; perhaps not a waste of time but cognitivly beneficial activities.Today's video games and TV shows, the plots of, are much richer and more involved than say ""pac man"" or ""Three's Company"" of decades ago.This is a very basic snapshot of what you will find within - and a scratch of the surface. If you enjoy Gladwell's books (i.e.The Tipping Point: How Little Things Can Make a Big Difference) you will probably enjoy this."
4,Dunk and Egg are great!,"I bought this to read the Hedge Knight, the first Dunk and Egg story. It is a great story. The rest of the book is filled with other good short stories as well."
3,Bizarre game..,"My twin boys (and I) couldn't really figure out how the game is suposed to be played, with the very minimum instructions, but they still love playing with all the pieces and they love the movie, so it wasn't a total loss."
5,An excellent book for daily prayer,This is a great book to add to your daily prayers. It will greatly help you to meditate and pray with the day's saint for his or her special intercession. We as a family are learning about these wonderful heavenly helpers of ours!
5,My view on Amish Nativity by Ruth Ann Gingrich,"I have started making the figures in the book, and I find the instructions easy to follow. The illustrations are very good."
2,spongebob,This will be returned because it wasn't age appropriate once I saw it. It is a nice product though. jan Menear
1,starts out nice but just wait....,"We bought this microwave new (not from Amazon) in 2005. We use it regularly but not aggressively--mostly just for re-heating, defrosting, frozen meals, and quick cooking fresh veggies. About 2 years ago, when it was but three years old, various numbers on the keypad stopped working. No problem, we could go around that easily. But then nearly each week some new function went awry so that now at age 5 years, only the ""3"" and start button works.We bought this model for its generous size, what we thought was a reputable brand and easy to use programs. I may be expecting too much from a product clearly built with ""planned obsolescence"" in mind, but starting to malfunction at three years (after the warranty expired of course) and being nearly useless at 5 years, seems really sub-par. I'm in the market for a new microwave but I won't be looking at Sharp models. I though LG's (any of their products) were crap, but this takes the cake IMHO."
5,Hero on Three Continents,An excellent read! Maitland-Lewis does a brilliant job of keeping me intrigued the entire way through! I enjoyed the character development and historical accuracy the story encompasses... A must have for any novelist's collection!
1,This is NOT a new release,"This is NOT a new release despite what it reads above for release date/original release date. This is a comp of two earlier releases from the early 90's and as far as I am concerned do not measure up to her latest work. This is the second time I have been tricked into buying her back catalog and although I love her latest, this stuff doesn't measure up, one listen then onto the shelf. Why?"
4,Blindsided,"Saw the jacket of the book and thought it would be an interesting read. It started pretty slow and I found myself having trouble following along in the beginning. The writing seemed one-sided and tended to wander a bit. Then I realized it wasn't so much wandering as it was an attempt to give the reader all the information and a feeling of being there in a similar situation. When it then dawned on me that I have friends like this character and I also have had some issues with anger, I found it hard to put the book down. I just wanted to know what happened next, how does he get himself out of this one. I can truly say I never saw the twist coming in the end and felt blindsided by the entire story. When I finished the book I was in a minor state of shock. It's sad to think that in this world, some one out there may read this book and say 'That's my life.'"
1,"Disgusted in Frederiksted, VI.",A book for youngsters which mentions the n----- word nineteen times should not be in publication. It is insulting. I would resent a teacher who would even think of reading this book to any of my grandchildren. This book should not be a part of a child's education. That it has come to light in a school is horrific. There are too many wonderful books for children...why this one?
4,War Comes to Willy Freeman,"In this book you will meet Willy, Lucy, Jordan, Captain and Mrs Iveres, Horance, and Sir Fraunses. The main character is Willy Freeman. Willy goes on an amazing adventure to find her mother after her mother is taken aboard a prision ship. She stops at alot of places during her long search for her mother like, Mrs and Captain Iveres place, then she stops at Sir Frauses tavern where she stays for 2 whole years. After her fellow helper Horance finds out that she's a girl and not a boy he starts treating her like a slave. Then when the war ends she finds out that her mother is very ill, and Captain Iveres doesen't want to call up the doctor to see what's wrong with her. That's all the information that I'll give you. You'll have to read to find out what happens to Willy's mom."
4,Earthy Blues Gospel,"If more preachers played Fender Jaguar guitars I might find myself converted.While not as electrifying as Fred McDowell or Sister Rosetta Tharpe, Charlie Jackson combines raunchy blues licks with rough-edged folk metaphors ""Jesus got his hook in me, and I don't wanna get loose""-- all I could want from a 70s gospel record."
5,this is it.,"raw, sweet, hypnotic. this is the apotheosis of electric guitar gospel blues evangelism. take it to the bank.""tangled up in Jesus"" and the testimony is worth the price of the disc."
5,An underrated Great Guitar Evangelist!,"Reverend Charlie Jackson is one of The underrated Great Guitar Evangelists.Powerful Vocals and Raw, Delta Blues Based Guitar delivery will send chills up your spine if you have any Soul at all!I have all his known recordings and Reverend Jackson IS THE REAL DEAL when it comes to Sanctified Holiness Guitar Music!(Rev. Jackson went home to be with Jesus this year in February 2006)."
4,Great sound quality for the price,If your looking for clear high resolution sound then this is it. This player has 3d sound options that make the music sound the way it should it comes alive. Scrap the ear plugs that come with it and get a pair of the shure brand plugs there expensive but really make this unit sound like your there. The color screan is great with great clairity and color quality. The unit is nice and small you can put it any were and not even know its on you. The only down side of it I dont like is the 10 hours of play back on a single charge. Over all I am very happy with it and was blown away with the sound Qualiy with the shure ear plugs. I would buy this unit again.
1,Stay away,"We purchased this for my son. Worst mistake ever. It lasted not even 3 months before it died. After researching online, I've seen many people have had them go bad soon after purchase. If you search online auctions (the most popular site) you'll find plenty of these listed that are being sold as not working. My advice is stay away from this. We're sorry we didn't."
3,Not for Mac Users!,"The device actually works reasonably well for the $$. I spent on it (rebates!). However I had to figure out how to use it by trial and error. There is no hard copy user's manual, only a help file on the CD-ROM. The help file is some Windoze frame application that won't open with MSWord or by any other Mac application. The web site does not have a user manual ftp. Otherwise, no problem using the Palm Mac software to load the applications and maps.Based on one trip it seems pretty cool. If only I could get my hands on a manual! It seems that a MSWord or pdf file would have been a bit more global, Magellan."
2,OK candy - not so much the shipping costs,"My wife and I are big fans of gummi candies, so I thought I would surprise her with these. The strawberry flavor was great but the texture was more like a jellybean than what we consider a true ""gummi"" and we weren't fans of the sugar coating which also detracted from the proper gummi texture.The worst part was the $9.29 shipping cost for a $[...] item. I should have been paying more attention, but it's not like Amazon makes an effort to highlight the shipping costs - the cost of the item is in bold red type and the shipping cost is always smaller and in grey.So 3 stars for the candy and 1 star for Euro Food Mart."
3,Unfair but true,"I hate saying it, but I will anyway. Lewis has not been able to live up to the expectations of his teacher, Morse. Unfortunately, that basic comparison will always be there... much as I hate making that comparison. It is very evident that the creators of this series have done everything possible to recreate the Morse magic including a classical background score, the same Oxford environs etc. But Morse was Morse. Lewis is not. He doesn't have that air of superiority that Morse had. I still associate him with being DS Lewis not DCI Lewis. I know that's unfair, but that's the honest truth."
2,Rather listen to Ciara,This album is ok that's it nothing spectacular about it. I'll pick up Ciara album before i give this a second listen. Get it bootleg don't waste your money on it.
3,I expected more,"overall the cd is alright i shouldn't have brought it bootleg but it was only 9.99 so i guess that wasn't that bad.1. girlfight- good choice for a first single2. taste of dis- okay3. long as you come home- even though this beat is on angie stones cd.i love it. THE BEST SONG ON THE CD.4. blah,blah,blah- i like it only because odb makes the song. nice to play in car.5. covergirl- nice sing that shows her vocals. she wrote good lyrics.6/7- hate them8. tell me why u dont love me- it's cool9. million bucks- i like it to play in the car with your girls when you are going out.10. dying of a broken heart- its cool i can relate11. i want u dead- its okay i like that she experimented with something different and it's a funny song.the rest of the cd i dont like besides laugh til i cry which is okay as well."
5,Spred the Chain Letter,"Brooke valentine is amazing her songs are increditable to hell wit tha other reviews I love this cd, it has its party songs like BLah BLah BLah and it also has those songs were u just wanna slap a b!tch like GirlFight and Whatcha lookin At, but to my liking was the ballads on the cd i think it could have been more slow songs I fell in love with Laugh til I cry the first time i heard it and I want u dead are two that are very relatible so do yourself a favor and buy the Chain Letter is worth it, and for the guy who said they'd rather buy Ciara -- HEY! ciara and brooke are 2 different women of very different taste so u can't compare the 2 just because they're both from the South."
3,I'm Gon' Tell U Like This....,"I Expected way more than what i got, it's some good tracks on da cd (BUT), it's somethin wrong wit your cd if your single slaps harder than 12 of the 15 songs on your cd. Your single is suppose to be just a piece of a good Album, not the Core of it, but don't get it confused, she do got some potential 2nd singles on her album tho', Like ""Long As You Come"", ""Cover Girl"" & ""Tell Me Why(You Don't Love Me)""."
1,WORST ALBUM OF THE YEAR! AVOID AT ALL COSTS!,ALL I HAVE TO SAY IS THAT I AM DEEPLY DISAPPOINTED. I WAS SO HYPE TO BUY HER ALBUM AFTER I HEARD HER HIT SINGLE GIRLFIGHT WITH BIG BOI AND LIL JON. I WOULD THINK HER ALBUM WOULD BE FULL OF FIGHT MUSIC AND HYPE BEATS. BUT THIS IS A BUMMER. TERRIBLE. THE BEST SONG ON HERE IS GIRLFIGHT. THE REST IS PURE GARBAGE. BROOKE VALENTINE SHOULD HAVE CAME BETTER THAN THIS. DO NOT BELIEVE THE REVIEWS. THIS IS ONLY WORTH BUYING BOOTLEG. BLAH BLAH BLAH SOUNDS TERRIBLE AND I WANT YOU DEAD MAKES ME WANT TO PUKE! DON'T SAY I DIDN'T WARN YOU! GO BUY CIARA'S ALBUM INSTEAD.
3,well its more interesting then ciara goodies,"and more riskier.......but that doesn't necesserily make it outstanding.however this album does offer a lot of unique productions as apposed to ciara,and ashanti's by the numbers R&B albums.so its ok i guess.but i would like to see her go even further out of the box.i would hate for her to come back with a typical R&B album the next time around because this one didn't sky rocket up the charts.the problem with urban music is that its too basic,and fornulaic.we have been force fed this type of urban music for so long even chain letter sound like an alternative to the mainstream(wich it really isn't).but thats the way it seems.i don't hate the album,i just don't think it stepped farther out the box enough for me."
3,Worthwhile,"A large part of this book is an atlas, one page per species: the atlas is in color, as is the Appendix, while the rest of the book is in B&W.; Actually there are two atlasses, one of close to three hundred woody plant species (including some monocots) in West Africa and one of fifty timber species that are important in a smaller area (apparently to be called ""Upper Guinea""). However, the three hundred species include some additional timber species, that for some reason did not make it into the second atlas.Per species there always is a description, a detailed distribution map (very clear, in lovely color), and often a line-drawing or color photograph (personally I would have liked more illustrations, if need be at the expense of the size of the distribution map). The Appendix presents maps in a fair degree of detail showing forest cover. The first hundred pages provide general information on West African forests."
2,Didn't work for me,I got this as soon as my daughter learned to shut doors to save her fingers. I chose this for the adorable factor. I guess you get what you ask for. It is adorable but does not work for me. My doors do not have knobs but handles so it is almost impossible to get the elastic band around the handle. It simply does not work for my doors. And I bought two!
3,A must see,"My son has never forgotten this book. I subribed to this series for him, but had to cancel half way through. I am looking for the rest of the set? It is just plain mesmerizing."
2,What's all of the hype,I bought this for my alpha black to hopefully increase accuracy and maybe some range. I noticed no difference from my stock barrel. It really isn't worth the price tag just spend the extra 15 to get a flatline or apex.I gave it two stars because it seems to be made well - however it does scratch easily
5,Easy-going,"Hi, at first I thought this pick guard will be a poor-quality one because of its cheap price. But then, I received it and I loved it. It was very easy to install into my Telecaster."
4,Directions,"My children enjoyed this toy when they were young...30-35 years ago. So, I gave one to my grandson. However, on his birthday, his father inflated the ball....without instructions. I think he overinflated it as it was too big in circumfrence for this 5-year-old. Instructions should have been included."
4,Loving it!!,"It took me a while to buy this cd, the main reason: bucause it's a 15 min long cd with just 4 songs, but once i heard it, i couldn't help but loving it. It's a sweet, warm album and very well produced. I've been fan of John for quite a while and he is one of those few artist that have the hability to impress me with every single release, in this album i'm particulary impresses with his vocals, he's at his best!!I give it 4 stars because i would have love at least one more song!! :sLove it!!"
5,A fine bluetooth headset...,"I've been using this headset with my Sony Ericsson w810i for a few weeks, and haven't been disappointed. The battery life seemed a bit shorter than expected, but that could have come from my having accidentally left the headset on for several days while I wasn't using it. An added bonus is that the headset is compatible with the charger for my w810i (the headset only covers half of the plug from the charger), so I only need to take one charger when traveling."
4,A sweet read....,"""Texas Splendor"" was Austin's story. I enjoyed it, but I have to say that it paled in comparison to the previous books in the series. I just couldnt completely warm up to Loree. I also felt that there was a lack of Chemistry between the h/h. I couldnt put my finger on it exactly, but something just didnt ring true. I felt that the conflict was resolved in a very hasty and unbelievable manner as well, but I so love this family..being able to revisit them made up for any of the flaws lurking throughout. My biggest wish? I want a book for Rawley!! All in all , this is a definite must read for any fan of this incredible series."
4,Great Summer Toy!,This is an all out great summer toy sure to please almost all ages. Make sure you have a lot of room because this thing really flies!
3,No editor?,"I'm in the middle of making my first recipe from this book. Cannellini and swiss chard casserole. The ingredients call for 2 tomatoes. Yet the directions only mention adding one. You are to bring the water to a boil. But there is so much chard in the pot you can't SEE the bottom. How can I check to see if the beans are nearly done if I can't dig down to the middle of my humongous pot to test them? I hope this is worth $9 for the 3 pounds of chard. Right now it seems it will feed 16, not 6. The verdict is really out on this as a trusted cookbook.I have to fault the editor for letting things like this get by.I have given it only 3 stars so far based on sloppy writing/lack of editing."
1,Junk & Deception,"What is SONY thinking ? Enough with this agony please. You hear your customers and you come out with FAN FAVORITES?? My god people .....wake up !! We want to complete the series.. Not fan favorites. Same goes for the short lived ""ARCHIE BUNKERS PLACE"" Give the people what they want and do it now !!"
1,"Sony Release 7, 8, and 9","Until Sony releases seasons 7, 8, and 9 of AITF, all their products deserve 1 star. It is an egregious error on their part."
5,Don't pay attention to the 1 star reviews,"These are the best episodes of the entire series. I have seasons 1-6. I let someone borrow season 2 disc 2 because it was the best and they lost it. This new disc is essentially the second disc from season 2. I got lucky. There are those complaining about not getting seasons 7-9. I see your point, but that's no reason to run down this disc. This new disc is better than seasons 7-9 combined. Those seasons will get here but don't be too impatient, after season 7, there's not much Mike and a whole lot of Stephanie."
2,Worth a read but...,"Don't expect too much, it's rather dissapointing.Is he still alive and living in L'America? Well, we still don't know.Respect to Bob for making the effort though."
2,Tedious reading,"After reading this book I felt assured knowing that Morrison has been dead all this time, but disappointed in the lack of research. This author interviewed no one of importance, scarcely addressed any theories of murder or OD and was content telling the reader what happened on each day of search minute after boring minute. Great topic to write about, but The End fell short in many areas."
3,It's ok!,"This product really works on disentangle the hair, but as a conditioner is not good, my hair was completely frizzy using this as a conditioner as well, the smell is awful, it doesn't have a bad smell but the smell that it has to me is like a cheap perfume or a cheap fragance. It doesn't worth that much money because for a good detangler I could buy Paul Mitchells that is one of the best detanglers I ever used for much less money."
4,a useful primer,"I came across this documentary when I was looking for material on McLuhan for the course I teach on new media. When it's good, it's very very good. The heart of the documentary is an explanation of McLuhan's career and theoretical explorations, the best one-stop presentation I've found. There are some lengthy passages elsewhere that are tangential to the film's subject matter. But for people who are seriously interested in the evolution of the media, this is an important work. And the biographical background on McLuhan is absolutely fascinating."
4,Interesting mystery and drama of a small town,"Reminiscent of the Tales of the City books by Armistead Maupin this book jumps from character to character, allowing the story to build slowly. From letters written by a jilted lover to her ex who committed suicide, to the tape recorded ramblings of a semi-disturbed psychologist, we learn about the murder of a loud mouthed radio talk show host. The matriarch of the book is a woman who runs a Stop Smoking clinic which utilizes less than conventional tactics to break their client`s addictions.I expected this book with the tacky cover to be quite cheesy. I was pleasantly surprised that I was wrong."
3,not for big rigs,"I needed something to keep my hyper lab from jumping into my toddlers seats. While I thought this would work the best, it sadly doesn't fit in my ford excursion. It's just too small. Yes, I should have measured before I bought it, I just thought I would give it a try. So I ended up duck taping it to the seat belt anchors. Other than it not fitting, by several inches, it seems like a great idea and it would work well in something smaller, much smaller. You can not use it at the largest setting because it becomes too weak at the meeting joints. Fast shipping was about the only good thing."
3,Text for Technology & Project Managers,"Linthicum writes a comprehensive text for technology managers. The 500-page book describes the world of EAI in detail with an emphasis on web services. It covers the benefits and limitations of web services, provides examples of where to use and not use them, and introduces standards with an emphasis on XML. The book encourages IT to make the much-needed shift from an information to a service-orientation. As such, a considerable part of the book dedicated to emerging EAI styles, such as SOA (Service Oriented Architecture), which requires IT to think in business terms and promises to speed development and decrease integration time when correctly implemented. Coders and those looking for technical information on standards should look elsewhere. The book contains many diagrams that are crude but effective. The writing style is unrefined and repetitive. This can be overlooked if you're willing to skim through them."
4,good stuff,This creme works quite well on dark circles......it is very good. If the circles are dark and not deep it will cover themalmost completely.
2,Not as pictured.,I gave this backpack a low review because when we got it it did not match it's description. There were no blue splotches on it. There were however bright pink splotches along with the purple. Great for a young lady perhaps but my son was very disappointed. Thankfully returns worked well.
2,LASTED LESS THAN A MONTH,"I bought this backpack on the advice of all the people that liked this backpack. When I received it I thought it was sturdy enough for a fifth grader to take her books with her from class to class and out to the car after school. It was not dragged down sidewalks, or on a bus, just the above mentioned places. It has been less than one month and it is coming apart at the front corners on both sides. It is not wearing any better than the one I bought my granddaughter at Walmart this fall for a lot less money. Now I have to not only replace this one but hopefully the company will honor their return policy. But nevertheless I am disgusted and won't buy a Jansport again."
5,JanSport wheeled backpack,"Great for going to college. The amount of books I have to carry has started to put a strain on my neck and shoulders. With this wheeled backpack, it has taken alot of stress off of me. Jansport also stands behind their products."
3,difference with picture,We are very dissapointed. I bought for my daughter and we selected it together. When the product arrived she realized that it was very different from the one we had chosen. The picture description is wrong though the green is really a grey.
2,Useless Spikes,"To this date I have not notice any changes to my palms. We have had plenty of rain, and I have been applying proper water. Have sprinkler system, put hose on it as needed, have soil tester etc.. spikes are useless in my opinion."
5,Terrifying,"i have listened to the ""Eight Songs"" three times in my life. I'd say about once every ten years is a good estimate of how often it should be heard. i cannot imagine what it must be like live. I have seen Marat/Sade live, and it was overwhelming, but it's not in the same league with this stuff. Forget Saint-Saens or Mussorgsky, ""Eight Songs"" is the best Halloween piece ever. If you like contemporary music or just want to be scared out of your wits, you must have this album. Even if you decide not to buy it, I urge you to give it a listen. Your life will never be quite the same again. I promise."
5,I grew up with Mike Hammer,Bought this for my son so he could read something else besides Star War books. Growing up I bought and read every one. I never looked back.
5,"Babes, Blackmail and Murder",Very good treatment of what i would describe as the ultimate in hardboiled fiction. The first three novels of Spillane's anti hero keep one reading late into the night. Each novel better than the last. Nice package.
5,"Excellent Book With Real Life Experiences, Not Just Opinions","This book was such a relief to me. Every other book I read on prozac, paxil, or zoloft was negative. Essentially, there are a lot of authors making big bucks writing about all of the negative aspects of these drugs. The effect is to make the depressed person feel even more guilty about taking a drug, and to make their families even more judgemental ""You really shouldn't be taking those pills. What's wrong with you!""After reading some of these books I had to ask myself, if these drugs are so bad why are so many doctors prescribing them?This book answered the question. It's about EXPERIENCE. Only a person who has taken the medication can truly judge it's effectiveness. And only a doctor who has treated many patients can make an educated decision about which medication to try. Everything else is just an opinion.If you suffer from depression, I recommend that you read this book first."
3,The Black ICAT,"ICAT is a kitty ready to set the right moves, or so it should. With or without the included cable ICAT can be used. Press anywhere one of the sensors are to interact with it, once touching the nose area. ICAT begins to respond, and users can create the sound of a turntable, by creasing its face. ICAT can play a matching game. Give this kitty lots and lots of music, or it will be come sad. ICAT has moods, and meows!Watch the changing colors on its face. If you see one color, you'll know ICAT is feeling a certain way!ICAT is not easy to turn off, which could be frustrating, for some. There is not a typical shut off button, or switch. All most all commands come from pressing ICAT's nose, in different variations!"
5,Love it!,"My 3 yr old daughter received this as a gift. It's super user friendly, has great educational games, and teaches hand-eye coordination. There are different cd's with different games. GREAT on a rainy day, or when you need 15 min to take a shower."
5,Best newschool movie ever!,the best ski video ive ever seen. great soundtrack and great skiing. jp auclair is amazing
3,Helpful,I like the belly bands. I am not that big yet so I think I will like them better in a few months. The bands can be a little restrictive if you are wearing a tight top over them. I liked them to cover the gap when you sit down. I would buy them again.
1,Dynamic health Mangosteen Gold.,I had been well experienced with different Brand Names to produce Mangosteen Juice. I do not believe this Dynamic Health Mangosteen Gold is made 100% Pure Organic Mangosteen Juice. I am trying to cancel my order (every other month order).I hope the Company who produce this Juice may double check to ensure this kind of Juice contains almost 100% Mangosteen Juice. Thanks. Shawn.
5,Good product,This product was a vary good price. And it helped my grandaughter. What else can I say to all around.
3,Ronnie 5,"Wouldn't buy again taste wasn't good , didn't do anything for me that I could really say helped me health wise not one thing."
1,"SIMPLY AWFUL...A TRAIN WRECK, really","If flat vocals, tone-deaf melodies, and purple-prose lyrics are your cup of tea, by all means...be my guest."
1,Some of the best derned comedy ever sunged into a song,"Laughable. When this first came out I recorded select songs for several friends as a gag gift. Years later people are still saying, ""remember that horrible album you gave us for Christmas? That was hilarious!"" I like his acting but where were his friends when he decided to record this?"
5,A Must Have!!,"This album is a must have for people who like adult, slower, message ridden music! Robert Downey, Jr. has bared his soul in this album and his piano work is beautiful to behold! Here's hoping to many more years of substance-free living !!"
3,Good...but,"I've always thought workbooks were kinda' silly. I mean, shouldn't the book itself guide you through its content? Why do you need a second book to help you understand the first. The only guidebook I've ever found that wasn't silly was Experiencing God, but that's a different story.This guidebook does ask some good questions and should be considered vital if anyone is leading a study of this book. It enables one to articulate their thoughts better. It is, however, mostly blank space for answers to the questions (why not just include the questions in the back of the original book...arg Capitalism!).All in all, if you're leading a study of this book, it might be a good idea to pick this bad boy up. If not, save your cash and see if you can make it through the book without the guidebook."
3,Great for a laugh and some fluff,"And a look at some of the most amazing costumes ever created for the screen. Take for example the white outfit she wore to the opera. The feathers erupting from the sleeves were so long Mel Ferrer had to draw them apart like curtains to see the stage.Speaking of this Count of C., he was an amusing if strange pursuer after Ingrid's charms.The Rollan dude was interesting as well, although a bit too weird at moments. It seemed that his sole interest in life was kissing Ingrid on the divan.The story is fluff and not well connected but definitely not boring and something I'd enjoy watching fairly often.I have to run along now but I can't think of anything else to say anyway so hail and farewell."
4,Pretty good watch,"I really like this watch. I wear it all the time. It works well in the pool or shower as well. The only thing I don't like is the light. It only stays lit for 3 or 4 seconds. In the middle of the night or in any darkness, it is impossible to tell what time it is without pressing the button multiple times. It's annoying mostly. I also wish it came with a black strap, but that can be changed at any jeweler. Everything else is great."
4,It's about time!,"Finally there is an atomic watch with day, date and stopwatch designed for women. This one's attractive and not as big as I thought it would be, even on my small wrist. I like the white leather band--well made and sporty-- although too long for me, but would also like to see interchangeable bands such as expansion bands available. I found this watch easy to set once I read the directions (always a good idea). My 'fantasy watch' would add the month as well, and would look appropriate with business attire too. As I understand it, this particular model is no longer available. I'm glad I bought mine in time (no pun intended), but I hope Casio has new models with additional features in mind."
1,Do Not Buy This!,"This is a very demeaning devotional that does not reach kids the way it should. It tells kids that they can not be themselves in Christ, the have to be what Mr. Luce wants them to be. Kids need to be individual and love Christ in their own way, not in the way that this devotional tells them to. This book tells kids that they need to trash all the music they like, and give up almost all the secular events that they like. I do not agree withthis because I think one of the most important things about being a Christian is finding God in every situation no matter how secular. God is everywhere, not just where Mr. Luce tells kids where He is, but everywhere. I respect you Mr. Luce but I do not agree with you."
1,Not a good buy,"The case is big and bulky. Also, it doesn't stay locked. It just pops open if you drop it. I haven't had any problems with the belt clip breaking as other people have. I wouldn't waste my money on it though."
2,Barbar's Yoga for Elephants,"In my opinion, this book is much more difficult than it's presentation. I take yoga and pilates and feel the instructions are not that easy to follow. The poses are too advanced for children ages 4 and under."
5,Good for what it is,"I had hoped that this book would be another collection of Bombeck's columns or pieces from several of her books... It is a little gift book edition of some of her best phrases. With whimsical illustrations and a lovely design, this makes an excellent small present for a true Bombeck fan or for someone who enjoys a little escape and encouragement."
4,A nocturnal journey,I began to tread this novel with a simple question vexing me; what is a point of this fiction. The plot is quite simple; and it only reflects the creativity of the author who is able to interest the reader through the 300 pages of the narration. The theme is about a university student Osama; who by the single act of reading a book is dislodged from his life as a student; to discover the meaning and purpose of the book. He undertakes an endless stream of bus rides in search of love and purpose.The plot is quite cleverly written and the unassuming characters as random passerby connect to the plot later.
3,I read 'The New Life' and it somewhat disappointed me..,"Pamuk has certainly a gift for writing, it is out of the question to discuss his creativity and great writing skills. Still, The New Life somewhat disappointed me in that it did nothing but confuse me. I found it quite repetitive after reading the first 50 pages, maybe I couldn't go to the deeper level of it, the level Pamuk had expected his readers. As I am a great fan of his works, I wouldn't say this novel is a disappointment to the general reader but only to the individual. It is a good book, but 'The Black Book' and his last work 'My Name is Red' are definitely much better."
1,Noisy,I am thinking I got a blender that was made on a Monday or a Friday :) This thing is loud and sometimes does not engage when turned on.
4,you got what you pay for,It's a great machine for baking and preparing food. I just wish it came with more attachments for its price.
4,Good mixer,"I love this mixer. It looks great and works great. If you get other attachements, this mixer does much more than just mix. I love the variety of colors. My only problem with this mixer is that the head doesn't tilt back. I know that KitchenAid makes models that the head does tilt back but when I purchased this, I didn't know that they made a model that didn't tilt. I realize that this was my fault but my issue is that I don't see a reason in even making a mixer that the head doesn't tilt as it is sometimes very hard to get ingredients inside the bowl. Overall, great mixer.Pros: beautiful, works great, can do a variety of jobs with other attachmentsCons: head doesn't tilt"
4,KitchenAid Mixer,"I have enjoyed my new KitchenAid. I'm thinking that I may have liked the smaller model that has the beater that tips up instead of having the bowl lifter, as it is awkward sometimes working around the beater. Overall, I am happy and can mix a lot in a short amount of time."
5,great. no problems,highly recommended. we use this for commercial use so it takes a lot of abuse. great so far. no problems. great price on amazon.
5,Kitchenaid mixer,"This product is a must have for anyone serious about baking. This mixer is by far the best appliance that I have purchased for my kitchen next to the refrigerator of course. I reccomend this product to anyone who loves to bake. The 5 quart + was worth the money, don't buy the 4 qt, save the money and purchase the 5, you'll be glad that you did!"
5,"It is a serious medical mate...and it's P.D.R.so, have it!","I got this book several months ago and I as a orthopaedist,who uses nsaid, and antibiothics, must see what about other drugs my patients are taken, and Iam not very cloused to many other drugs,so I found it a diamond for my madical-bag, it goes with me every where...I need it a lot..., I will buy next editions."
4,Teachers building planes in WWII,"A great read and true story. Provides a wonderful view of two teachers working in a World War II defense plant during their summer break. one can easly imagine what these two women went through to do their bit for the war effort. It is a wonder that we were able to produce all those B-24 Liberators to defeat Germany with the ""girl"" workers available in America. The book includes some very funny happenings, some unfair labor rules for women, the part shortages and reworks needed to sucessfully complete another B-24 at Station 20. A high school English teacher and an Art teacher earning 68 cents an hour on second shift, without any ""assembly"" experience start without really knowing that a B-24 and Liberator are the same thing, to knowing the complex system inner workings by the end of the summer. Very enjoyable reading. The only dissapointment is that you finished the book."
1,A self-important piece of junk!,"Without a doubt, one of the worst textbooks I have ever read. His style of writing reeks of self-importance. I guess he's trying to impress us with his intelligence. I am required to read this as part of an MBA program. While I fully support a discussion of values as part of an MBA program, this book has absolutely no relevance to today's business world, and universities that choose this as part of the cirriculum are doing their students a dis-service."
5,Aphorisms alone are worth the price,"I think that the entire book is fascinating, but the one part that I read over and over is the aphorisms section. The entries are, at once, deceptively simple, sometimes offensive, always provocative, and ultimately mind-blowing. Similar in tone to the aphorisms in ""Twilight of the Idols"", but somehow more incisive and memorable."
5,Skil 18v replacement drill battery,The product is just as described. Saved me from throwing away a perfectly good drill. Strong and long last. Would definitely do it again.
3,works okay,"Works like supposed to do - wish they could update it so I can use the ""newer"" batteries on my old drill!"
2,A MISS.......,It was like watching a not as funny full length version of The Office. Ed Helms acting range is very small - seems like he is playing the same person in every roll including this one - same character as Andy. I would save your money and time this movie missed the mark.
3,Not funny,"Ed Helms at not his finest. So many other wasted actors, who are typically funny, but not so much in this movie."
1,Go outside and breathe some fresh air,"You'll need it after about 10 minutes of the canned jokes and predictable plot line.This movie is so poor, that it's painful to post the minimum number of words required to post this review."
1,Don't pay for it.,"terrible movie, not very funny. Annoying main character. 80% of the movie revolved around the span of a weekend at one location which makes it boring."
4,That Could Have Been Me!,"I was glad the film ""Cedar Rapids"" was made. Had I gone there to work at CBS affiliate KGAN-TV Channel 2 as a video editor following my college graduation, I might have very well run into characters who are similarly shady to Dean Ziegler or Bree, the prostitute. No wonder my ex-girlfriend left Cedar Rapids and is now in Atlanta."
2,Sorry I bought it.,"The backgroud information this gives about the crusades is not only no better (for a DMs use) than any history book from your local library, it is slanted in favor of a pro-muslim, pro feminist point of view.As far as actual game mechanics go there are no character/monster write-ups, no maps (none that you couldn't get from a history book), no (complete) scenarios, and worst of all, the author completely sidesteps the issue of opposing clerics in a monotheistic campaign. Clerics are treated in the most generic form possible.What a waste."
3,Pleasant groove,"The cover of this CD is a picture of clouds. If memory serves, my first LP of this artist was Mountain in the Clouds. Mr Vitous seems to be a kind, gentle person with a strong spiritual side if clouds, titles and music are any indication. If you like airy, open music played by masters, music that you might find played as store music in a San Franciscan Alternative Bookshop or in an upmarket hip dentist's surgery then this may well suit. Reminiscent even of Mr Stan Getz' Samba phase - not that there's anything wrong with this music. It's Saturday-morning-with-a-cup-of -coffee-with-the-sun-making-its way-through-the-curtains-and-a-bird-or-two-chirping-outside music. But don't expect to be shaken or stirred by it."
4,Excellent learning/guiding ROMANCE book,"I was fascinated by this book due to the great value for me personally, in the way MIP discussed and analysed the purpose of life and the directions one may choose at certain time of one's life using her characters. As it's major heroes, I feel at the crossroads, trying to find and recapture the values of my youth and to find out what I am to do with the rest of my life. No matter how little (as other reviewers who are probably much younger than I am claim) ""romance"" there is, this is a deep, helpful, and wonderful book. You cannot evaluate the book on the descriptions of lovemaking only: you have to learn from it as well, and this is one that can gives you both. I wish the author would consider the continuation, something in the way Suzanne Brockmann does to hook up her readers. *** If there a chance to contact MJP personally, I'd love to."
4,Far from the well-known Pharcyde,"Ok Ok. I read the reviews below and I can agree somewhat for all of you who enjoy the classic Pharcyde with Fatlip. I enjoy it too... But, obviously this group has matured with time. This album doesn't have tracks that Bizarre Ride offers or Labcabincalifornia. In songs like ""Trust"", ""Networks"", and ""Misery"" they rhyme about what they have learned over the years. If you are a true Pharcyde fan you will appreciate this album as they have gone from boys to men."
2,"Don't ""trust"" the pharcyde","The Pharcyde without Fatlip is like ATCQ without Phife, it just cant work. The cd was alright though, not terrible. Trust is definetely the best song on the cd. Network is good too, and frontline is ok. The rest just uhh, sucked. Imani is a good MC and all, but I would recomend saving your $ and getting something else unless you are a hardcore pharcyde fan."
2,This book is very dated and mostly worthless now,Title says it all this book is just a compilation of articles taken from a very old publication and put together in order to sell a book that is mostly worthless now.
1,Laaaaaaame,"This book starts out intriguing. The main character is riddled with grief over a horrible thing she did years ago and now she's in her mid 30's and dying of old age (...?) and she decides to bear her soul to a priest. So, sprinkled among long descriptions on how to make soup and harvest plumbs among other menial household tasks my imagination has always been satisfied to skip over, we have a basic plot surrounding two unmarried pregnant girls. Honestly, although I did not expect the twist to be what it was, it just didn't add up to anything in my mind worth telling a story about. At the end of the book, after our first main character gets this big secret off her chest, she feels better and goes back to doing housework.Basically, the writing was dry, the plot was empty, the characters unappealing. I was compelled to find out what the big secret was and after that, the only thing that kept me reading was the fact that I only had three pages left to go. Waste of time book. Bad."
5,Excellent Product,This was exactly what I was looking for. My 16 month old daughter just loves it. It is the perfect size for her. The spout is excellent. The water comes out just like you would hope. She has fun filling the can and watering the flowers in the yard. She'll enjoy this for years.
5,All the action you might want.,"When last we left our intreped time travelers, they had saved Galileo from the inquisition, the American Ambassedora had fallen for a Spanish swashbuckler, young love had conquered all, and Italian merchant empires were learning the meaning of ""telecommunications"" and ""inside your loop.""This book picks up immediately after.We should hear no more from people asking Flint & Co. for action. To say more moves into spoiler territory, but artillery, siege of castles, escapes in the night, the Spanish Inquisition, burning buildings, and escapades worthy of Bond, James Bond, should quench any fan's desire for a retreat from political haggling in smoke filled rooms.This bodes well for the NEXT book (1635: The Baltic War) due out next spring."
5,Scholarly But Not Stuffy,"THE INDEPENDENT CAROLINA BASEBALL LEAGUE... is a masterpiece of regional history. Sure, it's about baseball and the almost religious nature of its practice during this time and place. But there is so much more in the details about social structure , convention and the fine line between the public and private.Utley and Verner were quite diligent with their research. The collection of photos and the league statistics corroborate the many anecdotes and colorful player profiles. The linear narrative is perfect and puts some rails under what might have otherwise been a haphazard assembly of good yarns. I highly recommend this book to anyone who cares about baseball, the pioneer spirit, and well-documented history."
5,The river is a fitting gift,"If it were within our power, we would give our children the sky, the stars, and yes, the rivers. Michael Dennis Browne's Give Her The River expresses beautifully the powerful emotions parents feel for their children. Browne's skillful poetry is a welcome addition to the picture book genre. In addition to the peaceful and sometimes humorous imagery, the words themselves are carefully chosen and arranged to provide just the right rhythm and pace. The combination of words and illustrations make it perfect for cuddling up with your little ones."
5,"fantastic, but erratic","If you can get by the typographical errors and dry text, you will be rewarded. I agree with most of the reviews here-this is the finest volume I have read on the jfk murder case"
3,Ultimate Sacrifice,Good information and well written; but lets US Government/Intelligence off the hook. Organized Crime could not have controlled the cover-up. High-level US officials had to be involved.
5,As to the doubters...,"First, I'd like to say that most of the one-star reviewers seem to have precious theories of their own they are protecting. On top of that, many reveal that they have not actually taken the time to thoroughly read this enormous book by mischaracterizing the leverage which the mob gathered over the CIA.Excellent and meticulous (and tedious, too), I read this with an eye to at least finding some LIHOP (Let It Happen On Purpose) on the CIA's part (my pet theory had been in line with Oliver Stone's). Frankly, I think the authors did a pretty good job of portraying the CIA as embarrassed dupes.They don't have me 100% yet - that darned weird parade route is not adequately addressed. Something's up with the Secret Service, methinks..."
3,Fun read; good insights,I liked the book cuz for me it was fun to read the bad-boy's words. He actually is likable and even at times humble in the book. I only gave it 3 stars though because I would have liked to see more technical advice and more emphasis on no limit.
2,Owners of 'Burn & Firm' by the same author beware!!,"If you do not own the above mentioned tape, you'll probably find this workout quite good - nice, well choreographed moves, animated and amiable instructor... But if you do, you'll be disappointed to see that what you're buying is just really 'Burn and Firm'. OK, you get an extra yoga routine, but still I feel cheated out of my money."
4,OK for a change,"This workout is a little too bland for me, and while each day has a different workout, there are some repeats of sections. The cardio is the same no matter which day you do it; same with the upper and lower body toning as well as the yoga. Some days you have a choice which workout you want to do and it will occupy you. I enjoy this for something different; I fit this in one week out of every month or two just to shake up my routine a little bit."
1,disappointed,"I definitely should have rented this first. One of my favorite workout videos is Karen's ""Burn and Firm"". But I was getting bored with it. So, I bought this one to spice it up...and the first day was just portions of ""Burn & Firm""! I was definitely disappointed, and have not picked it up again."
4,Fine Quality,"First off, I totally love this movie and in addition to that the dvd arrived new and in good condition. The shipping was a little slow but everything was great overall."
1,Sadly Disappointing,"Talk about a disappointment. We have been dying to watch this movie since it came out. We finally got it for Christmas and stopped 30 min into it. The movie itself for quality was great, but there is a voodoo doctor in there that uses very dark and demonic magic to conjure up spirits and demons from the other side. In return for the power he promises to deliver lost souls to the ones he calls his 'friends on the other side'. It definitely is not for children and I really don't feel for adults either since he's blatantly using satanic dark magic. It never mentions this on the case and we sure wouldn't have bought it. I think Disney went way to far on this. Will not recommend this to anyone."
2,Too dark,"I liked Tiana. I think she's a good role model. She worked hard to make her dreams come true. I didn't think there was anything racist in this movie like some others have said. But, for my family, the ""I've Got Friends On The Other Side""/voodoo/demons theme of this movie was too dark. We saw this in the theater but won't be buying it."
4,Very good story.,The lead characters are very good. The supporting characters are great. The background and sometimes foreground music is well worth listening to more than once.
5,great movie,our 5yo daughter and we enjoyed this in the theater and are happy to add it to our movie collection.
5,Love it!,I love this movie! One of my favorite Disney movies! I also love having the digital copy to watch on my iPod touch on the go.
4,"Took a while, but...","The DVD took a while to get here, but once it got here it was great! The regular DVD works great on our portable DVD player and in our vehicle. Thanks!"
3,"Almost-Classic Disney Film. Great Animation, Terrific Voice Cast And Excellent Writing, But...","Walt Disney Pictures' 49th animated feature ""The Princess And The Frog"" is almost in the vein of classic Disney films (including the 2010 release ""Tangled""), as it has everything going for it, from a fairy tale as source material, beautiful songs written by Academy Award winner Alan Menken, excellent animation, terrific voice casting and pitch-perfect comic moments. But there is one thing that prevents it from joining the ranks of ""The Little Mermaid,"" ""Beauty And The Beast,"" ""Aladdin,"" ""The Lion King,"" ""Snow White And The Seven Dwarfs,"" etc. as a classic: the voodoo. I understand that Disney was being historically and culturally correct, as the story is set in New Orleans, but that element was way too heavy for a children's film. Bear that in mind when viewing this film. Rated G, but a PG rating would have been more appropriate, due to the voodoo."
1,THIS MOVIE IS EVIL!!!! NOT FOR CHILDREN!! CROSSES THE LINE!!!,THIS MOVIE IS SCARY AND EVIL!!!! IT'S ABOUT VOODOO AND HAS VERY SCARY IMAGES AND SCARY CONTENT!!! NOT FOR CHILDREN!!! AWFUL!!! DISNEY HAS REALLY CROSSED THE LINE!!! WOLF IN ANIMATED CLOTHING!!! NO NO NO!!!! AWFUL!!!
4,A Good Effort and a Nice album to listen to!,"Lucie Silvas, well I actually knew about her knew album after I saw her video of ""What You're Made Of"" on TV. That's when I really started to like her music. I listened to a number of songs from her new album and they are actually very nice compared to todays POP garbage that you get from young artists (Example: Britney Spears). Her music is more souful and it's also gives her good credit instead of doing something main stream.Of all the songs from this album I liked ""What You're Made Of"" most because it is so touching and reminds me of a reminscince of Mariah Carey's ""We Belong Together"" a little. A VEry Good effort from her. Also besides this, try Marion Ravion's debut album as well. She's from the girl band M2M. Happy Listening to guys!"
5,Excellent CD,"As another reviewer mentioned she really makes ""Nothing Else Matters"" her own. It is by far my favorite version of a song I love. The arrangement reminds me of my favorite instrumental version by Apocalyptica. It is the perfect vehicle for her voice and the interpretation is awesome. She is one of those musicians who has an innate sense of how to phrase and sound out the notes of a song. While there is a country twang to some of her work it also has a bluesy feel that would translate well to a variety of musical styles. Sadly her second CD went pop and doesn't hold a candle to this one. I hope she is sitting at her piano somewhere designing more vehicles for herself like ""No Defense"" and ""The Longer We Are Apart""."
4,Well Written Novel about Faith and Doubt,"""A Skeleton in God's Closet"" was no disappoinment. Although the beginning was a little slow, the plot took me and didn't let go. Maier presents readers with an archaelogical find that will either destroy Christianity or prove to be the most diabolical fraud in history. The protagonists must race against time to find the truth of the matter as the world changes around them. Maier was generally excellent at exploring issuses of faith, doubt, religious fanaticism, and anti-religious fanaticism. The novel deals with a serious subject but doesn't abandon humor. In fact, there is some pretty decent satire (especially directed against a fictional televangelist). The novel's romantic plot is somewhat cheesy but not enough to really hurt the plot. Overall, an interesting and at times thought provoking novel."
1,cut the crap and write about Josephus.,the title says it all bro. theres nothing new....no imagination at all...yo can tell everybodys next move...and you make a second one!......keep doing josephus or look for someone famous from the past to write about!.....from your best friend.
3,"Entertaining yes, problematic? yes","I wasn't sure as I started to read this book if the publisher was a Christian house or not, so I wasn't sure (but suspected) how it would end, knowing it before hand probably makes it a little less suspenseful. There are a few problems with this book, the most glaring one being that if a major newspaper came out with a story that the bones of Jesus were found most Christians I know would laugh, I don't care how serious the reports. Most people would ""know that they know"" that it would end up being a hoax and there lies the problem with this story line. I also found many of the people depicted just a bit to much ""overboard"" and the romance part of the book was a bit ""forced"". On the positive side, I enjoyed reading this book and trying to figure out if the author was going to let us hang at the end or solve the mystery, I would suggest giving this book to a christian friend as a gift, but try and convience them that it was written by an atheist."

4,"We like to play the ""grownups get to sit on their butts"" version","This is a fun game for the preschool set. The rules are easy to understand and the game involves a lot of physical activities. On each turn, the player has to draw a token that has a physical task to complete - like hopping, clapping, or belly rubbing. Personally, I wasn't usually up for getting off my butt and hopping ten times during the game - and my daughter would usually get the giggles while I would remain seated and swing my leg up in the air. My daughter is six now and has had this game for nearly three years. She still likes to play it once in a while, and it definitely got the most use of all of the games that she played at age 3-4. It's way more fun than candy land!"
5,Excellent Kirchner Experience,"This film is a great way to experience the artist's life and work. It does a great job of placing Kirchner in the context of the early 20th century. I just finished watching it and was very satisfied with my purchase.The narrator speaks in German and there are English subtitles. The film-maker uses actors to re-create the artist's experiences from Chemnitz to Dresden to Berlin and finally to Switzerland. He makes use of interviews with people who knew him. Of course, there are also images of his work. I was a little disappointed about how the film ended. I think it was too abrupt and did not fully explain or describe the circumstances of Kirchner's suicide. However, the recreations of the night life in Berlin is interesting and covered well."
4,"Book review, A Loss of Patients","When I got the book I realized I had already read it--sometimes I lose track. I really enjoy this series, about the RC priest in Fox River IL who helps the local police detective solve crimes. They are good reads, but be warned, no blood and guts, no f-letter words, no steaming sex, no overt psychopaths (sp?).It's hard to find the older books in the series in libraries, so it is good to be able to track them down at a reasonable price in Amazon. After reading,I usually donate them to our Friends of the Library sales."
5,A definite must for first timers.,"The guide was extremely informative about the important stuff like, how to bargain without getting ripped off, where to stay, and what to stay away from such as the no-metered taxi cabs, cane chairs, and tourist traps especially in the Kuta area. The Cd-Rom is more up-to-date than any book you could purchase in the bookstore because it is constantly being updated. My husband and I went to some of the restaurants that are recommended, and for the price the food was outstanding. This is for the person who wishes to travel to paradise on a budget, but who wishes to experience all that Bali has to offer."
2,Poor quality reproductions,"A very, very poor cousin of ISBN: 0894682199. The colors of most plates are significantly distorted by a brownish (sepia) hue significantly changing perception of the originals, and - thus - rendering the paintings very inaccurately ruining this book's visual appeal. Additionally, a bluish hue destorts at least ""Lady Writing a Letter with her Maid"" on p. 147. The 1998 edition from Abradale (ISBN: 0810981939) was affected by the distorting hues, but they may be also present in ISBN: 0810917300 from Harry N Abrams the former was a reprint of. Each printing has 168 pages."
3,"Good, but better options are out there","These Maxell sleeves work okay, but I really prefer the other ones sold by Supermediastore (via Amazon). Price is similar, but the quality of the others and slighter wider width, make those much better.100 Assorted Color Paper CD Sleeves with Window & Flap"
3,Safeco Mesh Desk Organizer,"Well-constructed and attractive organizer, but pay strict attention to the size. It is rather massive and took up too much space on my desk, so I had to return it."
2,Fine book. For high-schoolers with short attention spans.,"The book seems to be written for an audience of teens who want to learn how to do basic testing of graphcal user interfaces. It's easy to read, has snappy anecdotes, there are no errors and, ahem, nothing to challenge the grey cells.I suppose it's very good as far as it goes."
4,Great History Piece of Nick B's Academy,This is definitely the video that I wanted to see. I have great memories of Nick's players and this was a great trip down memory lane. I was not looking for an instructional video. I was looking for some history of what many consider to be a great coach and entrepreneur.This is a great look at what the academy was before IMG bought it from Nick B.
1,Book purchased was NOT recieved,"Book name: Emperor: The Gods of WarMy son, Jerrold A McKinney #573721, did not receive this book!"
4,"Innovative, sleek and energetic","While each track has a different mix, with apparently an independent artist mixing each track -the music remains cohesive. Sleek and energetic sounds that could easily make you drive too fast or ski slopes you might not otherwise take on..."
4,a lot of good stuff but...,"I really enjoyed this band. One of the best if not the best progressive band today. On this DVD we get a very interesting documentary of the making of the the album V (the best spock's beard album). And on the second DVD we have a 2 hour show from the day for night tour in Holland. Very good music but the filming is not to my taste, because we can only see close shot of the musicians during the entire concert. There's no audience's view perspective from the back. Despite of this latest point of view, go buy this DVD, if you love progressive music."
5,Log Carrier,"Great item for the price. I can carry between 8 and 10 logs, depending on weight and length without any hassle. Very sturdy carrier."
4,Comprehensive new Sound of Music album,"While I strongly stand behind my view that the Original 1959 Broadway Cast album with Mary Martin and Theodore Bikel is clearly the album of choice, this new production of THE SOUND OF MUSIC is equally as praiseworthy. Rebecca Luker adds her own charm to the part of Maria, as did Mary Martin and Julie Andrews before her. The Captain's singing is somewhat weak in a few areas when compared with Theodore Bikel and C. Plummer (Plummer was dubbed for the film), but he does very well with it. Patricia Neway from the old album is far and away superior to what we have here and Peggy Wood from the film version (Wood was also dubbed for the film).While I adore the film and its award winning soundtrack, I regret not seeing this revival when it was still playing on Broadway, as I was in NYC in early '99. This new Broadway cast album deservedly stands right up there with all the rest!"
5,Amazingly good,"This book is incredible. I'm in the process of applying. If you've got the time to devote to doing apps 'right', this book will guide you through a surprisingly rigorous, insightful, and valuable process to decide on and write your essays. Particularly if you're of an analytical mindset, it will help you apply very helpful, intuitive frameworks to thinking about your app. Buy this book."
5,A Striking Strategy Nailed My Essay,"I had a technically perfect, reasonable and ambitious Statement of Purpose and solid work experience. However, I wanted to be sure that it was a winning essay and turned to Avi for insight about it. After reading Avi's advice, it was obvious that my long-term goal of becoming a VP or Worldwide Marketing, while ambitious, was not adventurous or striking enough to secure my admission into an MBA program.Thanks to Avi, I reset my essay (and career) strategy to something that made me nervous yet more excited and confident that my Statement of Purpose would standout when reviewed by the MBA Admissions Board. I don't want to give away my competitive strategy, but I believe Avi's book and valuable experience will enable you to prepare your own striking strategy, possibly rethink your career goals, and is a ""must read"" before applying to any college. I landed in the MBA program that I really wanted and trust that you will be successful as well."
4,Really reduces redness,"This mist is awesome! It helps to reduce the overall redness of my skin and also brightens! I have some acne and it takes away a little of the redness of my blemishes as well. The only thing I don't like about it is the bottle. It usually takes 2 sprays to mist my whole face since the sprayer concentrates the mist in a small area. Overall, a great product! :)"
5,Fantastic film,Great representation of what is wrong with our healthcare system and what needs to be done in order to start fixing it. They say our system is going to crash... maybe that is exactly what it needs to do in order to be built up again the right way.
2,Decent but hugely biased,"As a medical student in the United States I thought this documentary did touch upon a few good points. That being said however, it was very biased against specialists and instead of having physicians speak it was mostly journalists and healthcare management personnel. One thing I will agree with however is the mentality of treat our bodies terribly and then fix is not the way to better healthcare. Some responsibility must fall of the patient and preventative care. Overall not impressed but was a decent watch. For those not in the field, don't take everything it mentions as gospel truth."
4,Eye opening!,Why four and not five - some of the facts were things that were already known from other similar films. But the idea that doctors feel that the system is broken also! Now that was worth the price of admission.
5,Love this one!,"I just got this video a week ago, and I'm addicted to it. Although I usually struggle with being motivated to do any type of toning and strenghtening exercises on a regular basis, I've already succeeded in working out at least 20 minutes EVERY DAY since I've had this tape! And I can already feel my abs getting stronger :-) This tape is composed of four 10-minute segements, each focusing on a different body part (the abs workout being my favorite - its the first stomach toning segment I've done that doesn't leave me with a horribly sore neck!). I was amazed at how quickly the ten minutes pass and you've completed your workout! Although Denise gets a lot of criticism for her overly-enthusastic manner and her often child-like references during exercises (i.e...saying tummies rather than abs) I feel that she is truly a strong motivator and an excellent coach who makes working out a little more enjoyable."
1,Poor diplomacy,"While this book does occasionally give an interesting glimpse at a diplomat's life, it is basically journalistic fluff. The profiles are superficial and often fawning, and broader political issues are largely ignored. It reads like a ""Visit to Washington"" column in a mediocre community newspaper. One gets the impression that the author wrote each section with the goal of being asked back to an embassy cocktail party. It was a disappointment given what I was expecting."
2,Anything Goes,"Oh what can I say about this book? It's advice of the wild and crazy variety, I read it with the song ""Anything Goes"" parading through my thoughts as an accompaniment. These authors would do well to return to their own roots if they want to really understand human behavior. They should read The Talmud and the Torah to understand humanism because humanism just isn't wild and crazy liberalism!"
5,A fine book.,Great background for understanding our innate sense for math. Well written and logical. Anyone teaching mathematics to any age will benefit from reading it.
3,alright,"Gives good ideas, not exactly a step by step book a new parent would look for. I don't agree with all her opinions either. She can be a little condescending. I'm sure better books exhist for parents out there."
4,Highly recommended,"I don't have a lot to add to other reviews, but I do hope the author would include more about night time toilet training in future editions. Both of my children were diaper free in the daytime before age 2 using the principles in this book. I cringe when I think of the environmental impact of how many more diapers we would have used by waiting longer. It is also nice to not have to change poopy diapers because they #2 in the toilet. This is a great book for learning how to toilet train your child in a way that is kind and with common sense. It is easily read in a day or two. However, there should be more information about how to deal with nighttime learning and its obstacles."
1,it's just a bunch of stories,"I'm a very technical person, and this book is all opinions and stories from places like African and how they potty train when they're 6 weeks d an whatnot. it's completely unhelpful and a little outdated if you ask me"
3,dissapointed,I purchased this toy for my son and was very disappointed in the durability. He grabbed onto the dancing monkey to many times and now it makes a horrible noise and doesn't always spin. He still plays with it because he likes the music and the lights. I just keep it in a room that he only goes into sometimes because the noise is so annoying because it is broke. Toys for children should be more durable.
4,Pretty good,"My daughter loves this toy and really helped her to learn to stand alone and pull her self up. But it's way too short!Very durable though, it's been though 3 kids now and is still going strong!"
1,not a good toy at all,"My son loves musical instruments, especially the drums, so I bought this for him for his 1st birthday. I thought I had hit the jackpot when I saw this, because it had everything. It has two height adjustments,(short and shorter)! My son towers over this thing. The dance mat does nothing but turn on the toy when you step on it. The horns do nothing at all but fall off. The toy plays what it wants to, and when the child is hitting the drums or piano you can't hear them over the toy playing its own thing. Like everyone else said, the monkey is a distraction and breaks after a day. This is the biggest waist of money ever."
1,Should be called kill the monkey..,"My little girl loves almost everything. But with this all she wants to do is grab the monkey and make it stop dancing- it makes a horrible noise when that happens. Save your money on this one. I did enjoy the reggae type music, it reminded me of our Caribbean cruise."
3,"Trois was okay, Trois 2 is a keeper","When Trois was being promoted, the big deal about the movie was the so called threesome scene. Turns out the movie should have been advertised as a suspense thriller, not some movie about a threesome. It was an okay movie, but Pandora's Box was GREAT!!! I really enjoy this movie. I would not buy Trois, but I would buy Trois 2 without hesitation."
3,BAR ROOM BLITZ,I love playing PC games but this one baffles me. I have a difficult time figuring out what to do or how to play some of the games... There's very little instructions.. I'm not that dumb to figure out most games.. But I could have used some more written instructions with the games in the jewel case....Joyce
5,Thank you for summarizing God's principals,"This book is small enough to travel,and packs a big punch of inspiration...it was in great condition when it arrived and I still love my paperbacks to take in the sauna/spa hottub...you cant do that with a Kindle!"
5,The author is very modest,"The author is largely factual and painstakingly exact in her descriptions. For those interested in archetypal images, I believe that her review far UNDERSTATES the impact of this book."
2,Dumb book about dumb movies,"If your entire life revolves around action movies chances are (a) you're dumb (b) a virgin or (c) entombed in your own little comic book world. Marshall Julius shows all of these traits in this book. I also suspect that his grasp of beauty anf beauty in film would easily fit onto the back of a postage stamp.His assertion that 'Singing In The Rain' would have been a better film if it had ended 'in a bloodbath, Gene Kelly's guts exposed in a tchnicolor (sic) flash of violence' is plain stupid. As is his rather immature wish that 'one day all films will have the depth of plot and strength of character' as 'The Texas Chainsaw Massacre'.To conclude, this book is to serious film literature what Jackie Collins is to highbrow fition. Makes a great doorweight though!"
1,Forget It.,"This unit is underpowered. Putting the least bit of pressure on the hand unit will cause it to slow down and just about stop. (No pressure on the hand unit means it does nothing.) I guess if you just had a manicure a few days ago and wanted to do a tiny touchup, it would be adequate. Otherwise, it may eventually smooth edges and possibly even remove a ridge or two -- but I haven't seen these things happen.Oh, another thing: the discs are not identified in the machine. You have to look at the pictures in the owner's manual to see what the discs are called and what they do. Then you have to look at each attachment in the machine and match it to its picture. Once I did this, I took a magic marker and put numbers on the attachments' places in the machine, then numbered the pictures in the manual. But this is only of marginal help because you won't be using them much anyway. Don't waste your time or money."
2,The Dog Whisperer: Beginning and Intermediate Dog Training,"We were very disappointed based on what we thought we were ordering. The title is misleading. ""Dog Whisperer"" and ""Beginning"" dog training fall a bit short of my expected content.""Whisperer"" should involve emulating how the animal interacts in the wild. The horse Whisper takes control of the horse by emulating the lead stallion in the herd. A dog whisperer should be able to control a dog by emulating the alpha dog in the pack. This DVD illustrates basic treat reward dog training and has nothing do do with dog whispering per my expectation.""Beginning"" training should include how to house train (not even mentioned in this DVD) and how to get the puppy to stop mouthing/biting when playing (a common behavior that needs fixing). If the DVD touches on this it is very subtle. We have a new puppy (3 months old) and need to solve these 2 problems. This was THE reason for purchasing this DVD but it fell way short. We returned it."
5,Fine product and service,I have other DVDs of the Dog Whisperer. Wonderful learning tool for dogs and people. The service I received from your representatives was great. Obviously your company is doing everything right.Trish Newberry
3,disapointing,"Disapointing, very basic instruction based on getting your dog to perform for food. If you are a Cesar Milan fan, this goes against a lot of what he does and teaches."
1,This is not the REAL Dog Whisperer,"Like others, I purchased this DVD thinking it was Cesar Millan. It was misleading because I searched Amazon on Cesar Millan's name and this was the second result to come up. We figured we'd watch the DVD anyway since it was my mistake. First of all, the formatting of this DVD is extremely annoying and choppy. Secondly, I'm not sure that I agree that feeding treats to my dog until she explodes is really the best way to train her. Third, it said something about puppy training in the title and I couldn't find ANYTHING on the DVD about puppies at all. Could be it's there and I just lost patience before I got to it. I DO NOT recommend this DVD at all."
1,Waste of Money,"This DVD was so boring and was a waste of money.It also hardly showed much training, it was very short. I was looking for a good training video, and it was more funny and entertaining than educational, so I learned nothing."
1,Not worth buying,Do not buy this DVD. The whole premis of this DVD is to give treats (food). Instead of training the dog using positive reinforcement. Training using treat just gets the dog used to getting food for doing what they are told to do and then when you stop using food you have to retrain them.
1,Not worth the money,"I did my research on key locators because I wanted to get one that was effective enough to remedy my fiance's perpetual key-finding problem. This key finder worked the first few times sporadically and then, after less than a month, completely ceased to work.I do not recommend that you purchase this product."
2,Not really a cough drop,"Ricola is known for cough drops, but the Ricola Supplement Drops, mixed berry are not really cough drops. They do not really sooth the throat and they do not last as long as the original flavor, square version of the Ricola cough drops. Also, the product seems like it would melt in warm temperatures. I dislike it when my candies or cough drops melt."
3,One worth collecting,"It's a little too hard to say I really enjoy this CD because I did not listen to it very often - I'd prefer a slower interpretation of Beethoven's Violin Concerto. I do enjoy Heifetz's other CDs such as Brahms, Tschaikovsky and Sibelius's violin concertos, and I think they are really great. However, I am more pleased with this Beethoven's concerto played by Oistrakh/USSR State Symphony, Schneiderhan/Berliner Philharminiker, Szeryng/Concertgebouw Amsterdam and Zukerman/Chicago Symphony, in more than 10 versions of this work I have ever collected."
5,An endless source of stories that continually inspire,"I run a leadership programme and I find this book a source of stories that will encourage, inspire, recharge and generally ""activate"" people. I use my book whenever I sense the attention of the group is flagging, and the stories never fail to get a reaction!"
4,Windows XP 70-270,"Typical of the Microsoft Press books, the XP book covers most of what you need to know to be successful passing the 70-270 certification exam. You can't just read it, but should plan on performing all the exercises and make sure you understand what you are doing. If you want to know everything you'll need, then utilize the references identified in the second section. Windows XP is by no means dead as the corporate demand for Vista just isn't there. Anyone working in IT support should know all about Windows XP. Good Luck"
1,Horrible!,"I ordered this product, and the product key for Windows XP did not work. Amazon.com proceeded to tell me that they needed to ship me an entirely new shipment, rather than send me a valid product key. I recieved the new package, send the defective one back, and tried to install XP Professional. Upon installing the second time, the product hung at the license agreement. Do not buy this book. The only reson I bought the book was for the trial XP software, but I would like to have been sent a working copy!"
4,Great referance book for everything you need for the exam,"This kit is ideal for anyone wanting answers to their certification questions. Great detail, the only thing that could improve is if they took the exam for you."
4,Passed 70-270 Exam,"This is definitely a better book compared to the Microsoft Unitek Book 2272c book which I received while attending a class there. I leart a lot from the book, the authors provide detailed explanations and gave practical troubleshooting guidelines. The only thing is that the ebook was in pdf format which do not allow you to print. I spent most of my commute time in the bay area studying for the exam, so it would be nice to print some chapters for reading instead of carrying the book or a laptop."
4,Pass at the First shot at exam,"For the amount of reading this book has, and the structure of it this is an easy pass...Would recommend it anytime..."
4,Great starter book for passing the 70-270 exam,"Start here and read this book first if you are planning on taking the 70-270 exam. The book is very simple to read. I give it 4 stars because it lacks in some areas, but overall it's a great starter book. The Measureup cd provided with the book is WELL worth the purchase of this book if buying it for nothing other than a practice test. If you would like further reading material after this book, i suggest the MCSE Fast Pass as recommended by the reviewer ""Jedi"". Those 2 books, the Measureup cd and study time are all you need to pass the 70-270 exam. Good luck!"
3,This DVD could be so much better,"I think having two discs was a waste of space, because on the second disk it's only the live show music with the background video playing, it is not a multi-angle option (like the dvd says). Also the sound is just bad. A lot of the guitars and stuff is just indistinguishable, I know Korn is capable of doing a lot better. I guess I can give them a break considering they were just out of the recording studio when they filmed this, so they weren't quite warmed up to the live playing aspect. But a lot of the sound problems occur in the eq'ing. There are too many mid's, whoever engineered this should be shot because he did a bad job making the band sound their best. It's a good effort, and I hope that Korn comes out with another live DVD showing their real talents.ROCK ON!"
5,Good performance,KoRn just surprised me. I haven't had great expectation on seeing them live on stage. Always thought Davis' voice was a kind way weak on the stage but at this point I should review my opinion on that.Not only KoRn's singer performs well on this show as the whole band do it fairly.Bottom line is that this footage will entertain you for sure because they honestly did sweat to make it genuine.Technicaly and musicaly this was a great show.
4,A mixed bag but hard to quibble with Bacharach,"A mixed bag : All of these tracks are good, but not all are by the artists most associated with the hit recordings one remembers. There is, not surprisingly, an emphasis on artists who recorded for EMI, such as Cilla Black and Shirley Bassey. Still, there is high quality music here and the performers (and performances) are generally first-class. Bacharach fans are accustomed to multiple interpretations of his finest material, so if you enjoy these artists you'll likely enjoy this set."
5,Truely Amazing!,"Children of Eden is a musical I was just in. I got this cd as a cast gift and it always brings back the memories of my musical. Even if you've never seen this musical or haven't even heard of it, you might want to consider listining to it. Favorites of mine were, the return of the animals, Fathers Day, Spark of Creation, Lost in the WIlderness, Ain't it good, and my most favorite, Generations!You would think that it's all this religous stuff and boring music but believe me it's not! It has songs full of flavor and excitment but yet songs that really relate to many people. One lyric I always remember singing was in the song In the Beginning. The lyric was ""Our hands can choose to drop the knife, our hearts can choose to stop the hating. For every moment of our life, is the beginning."" I don't know about you, but that simple line of words really made me think about people in our world. Please just listin to it, it well worth it."
3,I liked it but I didn't at the same time,"I saw this show premiere at the 1996 Internation Thespian Conference, and I have to say I wasn't impressed by it, but when I heard the New Jersey soundtrack in contrast to the original recording sold at the fesitval, I was please to hear what I did. Steven Schwartz has a way of putting anything into great music."
3,Not as good as original,"Not sure you can find the London version with ken Page, but well worth the hunt. It's superb. This is adequate, but lacks the soul that the original does. HOwever, the music is sweet and touching. Schwartz is one of my favorites."
1,GREAT MUSIC -- VERY BAD QUALITY DO NOT PURCHASE!,"If we're looking for the Clark Sisters old albums, then we are obviously big fans of the music and know how fantastic it is. Thus, I my review is not of their music, but the sound quality of this CD. It is a pure waste of money to spend on any one track or full album purchase because the muffled sound you hear on the sample is exactly what you get. I'm not sure why someone would continue (or even allow) this item to be sold on this website. For the record, this is not the original master recordings. If any of us owned these old albums on vinyl, you already know the vinyl DID NOT SOUND THIS WAY. This reissue was done by some very incompetent people. Conclusively, if you want this music, find a copy of the vinyl and record it to a CD. You'll be much happier with where your time and money was spent given the result."
4,The Clark Sisters CD,"It took a little longer than I expected to get the CD, but I did receive it in good order."
5,Better Than Beacon Street,"This DVD is much better than the ""Beacon Street"" disc. The recording is clearer making each instrument and voice more distinct. The bass is also up a notch. Most of the songs repeated between the discs like ""Mexico"" get a better treatment on ""Pull Over."" The ""Frozen Man"" intro is very funny along with the cue card incident. I also like the way that he has his back-up singers around him for some of the songs. This ends up having the singing pan across the whole front soundstage rather than just in the left speaker as was the case on ""Beacon Street"". Songs like ""Only One"", ""Millworker"" and my favourite ""Shed A Little Light"" are alone worth the cost of the DVD. Definately a required disc if you are a James Taylor fan."
3,Word by word phonetic pronunciation would be helpful.,"This book does include a general pronunciation guide at the beginning of it. However, for each word within the dictionary, there is no pronunciation for that specific word. So, when I'm wanting to learn to pronounce words from cajun songbooks, I have to take the word, then go through the pronunciation guide at the beginning, hoping I don't miss or misinterpret any of the rules. I guess this forces you go learn the rules, but I'd prefer the pronunciation spelled out for me on a word by word basis."
1,Get rechargeable ones instead of these,"Don't buy so many of these alkalines, they will end up in a dump and harm the environment. Plus they cost a lot of money.For lower cost than this you can get NiMH AA batteries, they can be recharged upto 1000 times and offer better battery life.So getting rechargeable ones will a) save you money b) save the environment."
4,Getting better,"Of the Guidebooks thus far produced, Tome and Blood is the best. WOTC has finally (it appears) to have settled on a format for these guidebooks and the layout is excellent.The prestige classes range from the creative 'Acolyte of the Skin' (who willingly trades their humanity for a diabolic nature) to the Cthulhu inspired Alienist (who bargains with dark forces) to the Marvelous True Necromancer (who brings the Necromancer into their own). The Spell oriented feats are equally well designed and provide for a variety of opportunities and variations as well as allowing casters to tailor their spells to their favored element (Fire, Ice, Sound, etc.).All in all, an excellent book that is (still) unfortunately priced a bit too high."
3,Overpowered Rules Additions,"Tome and Blood continues in the vein of Sword and Fist and Defenders of the Faith. Much like the second edition class books, however, this presents some unbalancing rules. For example, one feat allows you to combine elemental damage in a single spell, so that a Fireball cast by a 10th level sorcerer could inflict 10d6 fire damage AND 10d6 acid damage simultaneously. Another feat turns any ranged attack into a chain spell (like chain lightning), so your characters can toss around Chain Magic Missiles or Chain Disintigrates with reckless abandon.The prestige classes are also highly powerful. One, for example, mutates sorcerers into half-dragons.Overall, the book has some good spells and campaign enhancements, but it continues the disturbing trend of 3rd Edition D&D devolving into a munchkinfest."
1,Worse Than Their First,"How did this band ever get funding for another album???I actually picked this cd up in the $1.00 bin at a pawn shop the other day thinking it might be ok. Well... It's a musical disaster. This album is even worse than their first release. The music is boring, the guitar riffs are pathetic, and the singers voice is like finger nails on a chalk board. Sometimes it sounds like he actually has marbles in his mouth.There are so many other good bands out right now, don't waste your money on this one."
1,Completely Focused on Training and Development,"This ""book"" is really 2 articles from the July 1988 issue of Training & Development. They may be great articles for the training and development people, but they are not sufficiently generalized for the rest of us."
1,Poor Waranty,"Have used this in my office, ONLY, for about a year. Seems a little more tricky to un-fold than others but no biggie. Comfortable for 5'9"" although i cant quite rest my feet on bottom rung without making an effort to reach it. At about 1 year, the bungee cord on one side frayed & broke! Says there is a 2 year warranty. e-mailed company & got a quick reply of ""cords arent warrantied but you can buy replacements at our web site"". WOW, great warranty!!! I could see an issue if it was outside all year & in a poluted environment. If an item is faulty, why would I replace it with the same thing (DUH)? Bulk 3/6"" bungee should work as well or better & much cheaper. One Star as an (inexpensive) wear item should either be warrantied or made with higher quality to cover the 2-year warranty. Many loungers out there w/ more quality."
2,"Chair won't stay ""locked"" in reclined position","I'm returning this chair. It would be great, if it would just stay in position. However, as another reviewer reported, the ""locking"" mechanism doesn't work well. You get into the reclined position you want, lock it, and the chair gradually slides you back into the upright sitting position, no matter what you do. We tried everything, thinking maybe we just weren't locking it right. But no matter what we did, we simply cannot get it to stay ""locked"" in a reclining position! We have a similar chair from another company that stays locked just fine. So this one's going back. Too bad. It's a very nice chair, otherwise."
5,Great Stuff,Who ever said German is not a beautiful language hasn't heard this album. I give it 5 stars. I only wish I understood what the h@ll the lyrics meant.
5,Separating Facts from Fiction,"What a wonderful, solidly-biblical, objective, look at a subject so often shrouded by mystery and confusion! This book is a winner when it comes to clearing the smoke out of our eyes relative to those biblical issues depicted in the 'Left Behind' series. The Bible (as Gary DeMar expounds it) gives us nothing but facts (truth about the future). 'Left Behind' gives us little more than imaginative fiction. This book is a MUST READ for both Christians and non-Christians alike."
1,As biblical as DaVinci Code is historical...,"Just reading the assertions made in this book shows me that the author hasn't a grasp on what is means to interpret biblical prophecy. Rather than trying to refute the obvious failings of this book, I'd recomment that if the author wants to write fiction, perhaps he should take a lesson from Dan Brown and come up with some really strange ideas that no one in their right mind would believe if they were to actually do their own research."
1,What happened?,"An avid fan of Alanis for many reasons, I bought this CD (no interest in the DVD and haven't looked at it yet) in hopes that it would replace Under Rug Swept, which has been in my player almost continuously for over a year. What a disappointment. Eight original songs, count them - Eight - and nearly all below par. I, too, believe that they are too self-centered and show little of the meat that was apparent in both Jagged and URS. Sister Blister (whom most seem to like) is as dumb as its title. Please. Who else can I buy? Anybody have a recommendation? If she continues on in her past fashion, Alanis' next album should be a good one, but we'll have to wait a long, long time for it."
4,Classic,Enjoy this generation after generation classic. I know that I will. I have not read it myself but have heard marvelous things over the years about this incredible series. I hope to find that it is more like The movie Wizzard of Oz 2. I do so love that movie as do teenagers.
3,Not the perfect sequal.,I have read all 14 of L. Frank Baum's Oz books. This is the first sequal. And not a very good one either. It is really meant to be a continuing story of the Scarecrow and the Tin Woodman. And throughout most of the story the Tin Woodman actually proves that he doesn't really have a heart. And the Scarecrow will never be better than Mr. Wogglebug. I love the new characters. Jack Pumpkinhead is so nice. Ozma is most definitely the rightful ruler of Oz. And Mr. Wogglebug is just as exasperatingly lovable as Mr. Toad of Toad Hall. But everyone in Oz is so unpleasent to him. He should only be loved. This book is full of statements (mostly made by the Scarecrow) that make this book highly unrecommendable to children. So I'm glad I wasn't read the Oz books as a child. They would have given me the worst thoughts.
5,Review by one of the prosecutors,"As one of the prosecutors in the case, my review may be on the biased side, but I think John Phillips did a great job on this book. Somehow he made it accurate and entertaining at the same time. Having read John's articles in Car and Driver long before I ever met him, I always enjoyed his humorous writing style. After meeting him during the trial and afterwards, I appreciated both his writing and his humor even more. It was a very interesting case to investigate and try in court, but the book was entertaining even to me. Some of our witnesses opened up to him with more information after the trial was over. I hope anyone who reads this book will have an appreciation of the inside view of what seems like an incredible fraud scheme but is actually ""sad but true."" I know anyone who reads it will be entertained.Dan Stewart"
5,Great book.,"An extremely comprehensive book on Cayce's life and fascinating insight into inventions yet-to-be, past lives, the lost continent of Atlantis, soul development, etc.... The information is impossible to ignore. You'd have to be blind, insane or neglectful not to consider it as being valid."
5,"Top Notch Reporting, Riveting Narrative!","Kirkpatrick's exhaustive research is in the best tradition of investigative reporting, without resorting to the currently-fashionable ""invention"" of unknown conversations and alliances. Neither an advocate nor a skeptic, he presents documented and substantiated events in an evenhanded way, trusting the reader to reach his/her own conclusion; whether it be bemused doubt, grudging acceptance, or wholehearted endorsement of the remarkable achievements of his subject. While a reader may choose to entertain ""informed disbelief,"" one cannot deny the skill and care that went into compiling this historical biography. It is engaging, well-written, never resorting to cheap suspense or literary license, but sticking to the facts. Kirkpatrick is a master storyteller, in the best tradition of White, Manchester and Durant."
5,No Soap...But plenty of Soul,This is a brilliant and heartwarming book that begs to be turned into a movie. But what else would you expect from the author who brought us A Cast of Killers? Take notice Tom Hanks! This is the roll for you.
4,"Quite long, in depth and vastly interesting","THis book starts off very slow but like a nice Gravy it cooks nicely this way. It is very interesting and somewhat inspiring, as well as fascinating. It definitely satisfied the appetite I had for Mr. Cayce and his mysterious work. It is amazing after reading this book to see how unknown Edgar Cayce is these days. His accuracy is astounding. I wonder also why a movie hasn't been made about this American Prophet. SOme of this book is very hard to swallow but in all it is very enjoyable and easy to digest. I urge all Cayce wonderers or even Psychic fans to take a long peek at this amazing Biography."
5,Brilliantly done from start to finish!,"The genius behind this movie is that it is, in effect, a theater production.The music through the opening scene is the overture, the songs are like something out of Gilbert and Sullivan (happy, and at times ludicrously fun).The rhythm is just right for young viewers (my daughter is a couple of months shy of turning 3 and she adores it), the pace is perfect.I highly recommend this video for parents that will be forced to watch it over and over; the songs are catchy enough that it's not the chore you'd fear it would be."
5,great music,My son really likes this movie. The music isn't bad in it! I even find myself singing as i am doing housework!
5,Pure Orchestra,I love this type of music. It is excellent listening. I listen to it as background music when I study. I also listen to it to relax. John Tesh is extrememly talented. I would recommend this to anyone who likes this type of music. You won't be disappointed.
5,A must for spiritual encouragement,"This book is a requirement for everyday spiritual use. When it first caught my eye, it was on hold for someone so I took a quick look and wrote the ISBN down. I obtained a copy because I've been working to familiarize myself with God's Promises. It was so encouraging I bought another copy to keep at work to read on breaks and lunches. It supports oral confession which is important to maintaining my faith. I have enjoyed it so much that I have purchased copies for many of my loved ones. I want them to experience the joy I am getting from it and increase their knowledge. It is worth every penny and more. Only the years will tell its benefit but it certainly helps me keep my eyes stayed on the LORD."
4,Surprising quality for the price,"First, let me point out the bad: It's labelled as a ""lapel"" microphone, yet the clip hardly fits most shirts. The bit that the microphone is supposed to sit in while not in use or to hook to a monitor doesn't stick to objects very well. The cord isn't well shielded at all against electronic interference.Other than that, it's a great microphone, provided the intended audio to be recorded is voice. (Don't expect it to do too well for music!) The resulting quality is spectacular for such a cheap device, though you need to make absolutely certain the cord isn't touching any power cables or anything that carries a charge, lest your audio be plagued with buzz. Using the noise reduction function of an audio editing program may be desired if the only audio in a recording is a voice clip from this microphone, as it isn't without its own ambient noise."
3,Works as advertized!,"Works as advertized! It's a mic and it picks up sound.small, compact and easy to use.well worth the money!"
4,Perfect $6 mike,"The only cons: just a tiny bit tinny sound and a little bckgr noise. All the rest are great qualities: sensitivity, omnidirectional (definitely more versatile than unidirectional), real 300-16000HZ spectrum, small, clip-on, cheap. Good for voice recorder, great for Skype (only don't put incoming sound through comp speakers), did I mention cheap?"
1,Cyber Acoustics Microphone.,Not as good as I thought it would be. Extremely sensitive and poor quality.
4,The Gospel in Jazz,"An excellent buy! I enjoyed every song and especially loved ""Falling In Love With Jesus"" by Jonathan Butler. He has a beautiful vocal range. Kirk's son Kyle did an outstanding job with his song as well, and it is always a pleasure listening and watching Mr. George Duke. I saw Kirk Whalum in concert along with George Duke a few weeks ago, so seeing them captured on DVD was an extra treat. True Gospel fans will not be disappointed in this find."
3,What's left is...,"Luis Mejia (son) - Air Supply's comeback turns up into an updated '90s effort for the band, but the sound is much more uneven than ever. The most acquiereable song here is Badfinger's interpretation of ""Without You"" which even got some mild attention, apart from a whole range of average efforts (""Stronger Than The Night"", ""The Earth Is"", ""Stop The Tears"", ""Love Conquers Time"") and the much dull side of the rest of the songs. As far as their creative phase since Lost In Love until the still charmful Hearts In Motion, there is nothing left than the talented ""Without You""."
1,What a piece of junk!,"The broom is small and not stiff at all, I can sweep right over messes and not pick them up. The pan is crappy too, it stays open after I use it and stuff falls out as soon as I move. I have to kick it closed. Plus the plastic is thin and weak. The price is completely OUTRAGEOUS!! For $11.50 you can get a set with a firm broom and the pan that closes when you lift it at Sam's Club. The Sam's Club version is strong and will last decades."
1,total disappointment,"Item was useless, it was too lite weight to do any good not enough of a barbed end to grab anythingI have a motel and I have plenty of sinks that could use a handy dandy tool to help keep them clear"
3,You get what you paid for,"It was smaller than what I imagined. The lock on the shaft does not lock tightly. When shoveling consistently, the handle eventually shortens/slides back down. Price was cheaper than $25, but including shipping it came out to $35+. So overall, I think I can get a better shovel than this for that price."
2,blah no results,"if you never work out, you might like this...i am in shape, run and do weights and i find it's boring and too easy. i usually love denise austins tapes, but this one wasn't very effective"
4,East Coast Hard Bop meets West Coast Cool in 1957,"I think this is a great record, and all the musicians are in good form. My only wish is that Art had opened up a bit more on the blues numbers. He may have been a bit intimidated by ""The Rhythm Section"" (who wouldn't be?) and played it safe.Having said that, I heartily recommend this music to anyone who loves good jazz and especially those interested in the various sub-genres like hard bop vs cool. So, 1 start off for the somwehat conservative solos, but 4 stars ain't bad!"
3,A nice inVESTment for the holidays.,"The colors and sizes provides many choices for a great casual sportswear vest. You get what you pay for, hence the lack of a lining or belted back. The material is pretty thick so it wears flat and looks great. Use it as an inexpensive way to class up restaurant wait staff, match up your church choir, or make yourself a bit flashy. It lacks a breast pocket so skip the hanky look.I bought the dark green vest and had the buttons replaced with gold tone metal ones to make this a Christmas Elf vest. Had the button holes enlarged as a result. Add a red shirt and you have a very nice Christmas look for mere dollars.Sometimes it is not how much you spend, but how you use it. Very nice deal."
3,"Eugene Holley Jr, Amazon Reviewer does not know EL CADETE","I was appalled and bemused by Eugene Holley Jr. saying that GONZALO slipped the Stars and Stripes into his grandfather's EL CADETE CONSTITUCIONAL!Holley, obviously does not know this music at all. That slow version of the Sousa tune has been in there since the piece was composed."
5,One of my favorite recordings,"I just love this CD. My favorite track is ""Sage of Lamberene."" It has the deep, African sounding voices throughout, but also has a section of a capella children's voices singing a rather difficult ""Alleluia."" I got this album for free from a bank or something, and am so glad to have it. I wish I still had liner notes for it. Fantastic album!"
2,Not great,"The premise is great. I'm a sucker for Kittens, I'll admit... this ""movie"" disappointed though.The video quality, despite claiming a to be produced in 4K, is clearly something below 720p - on a 1080p TV with an Oppo BDP-83 and a PS3, it has clearly visible aliasing on everything (greater than 1 pixel wide, meaning far lower than 1080p). I have no idea how they can claim 4K production - somewhere along, if it was indeed produced in 4K, someone screwed up. Anyone thinking this will be any sort of showcase for video should look elsewhere - It's quite possibly one of the worst Blu-rays out there.Now on to the content - I found it to be a little lackluster because there seems to be no actual audio of the animals, just mediocre music (which may entertain a 3 year old, but it did nothing for my enjoyment). I was expecting to hear some meows and barks.While it still fills a place in my collection, it's not quite what was advertised and not quite what I was hoping for."
4,Comprehensive guide for all but one known Hard Times Tokens.,"If you are a Hard Times Token enthusiast or simply wish to find more about your own token like me, this is the Bible. It is an easy to read guide with quality photos of coins that are roughly life size. Throughout the book one can find references to many experts in the field of Hard Times Tokens. However, I can find no suggestions in the book as to where those of us go from here when we find that our own Hard Time Token is not included. Perhaps I can find some of the experts through the internet?"
1,You get what you pay for.,I knew it was to good to be true when I saw a 10-cup coffeemaker that didn't look like a robot and take up more shelf space than the microwave. A piece of junk. I was exhausted trying to get pieces to fit into places. I can't even remember if it MADE coffee. I gave it to Goodwill but I felt sorry about that.
4,Please do not eat the soup,"After I read Ocean of Words, I ran out to buy the Bridegroom. In Ocean of Words, it seemed that Ha Jin created likeable characters forced into a restrictive society. In the Bridegroom, Ha Jin created some characters with a bit more of an evil streak. I will never eat soup from a stand again. This is not necessarily a bad thing; rather it just makes some of the reading uncomfortable. Still, better than most."
5,She's Stronger!,"Despite Britney recieving a no. 7 UK charting and her first non-top 5 hit in the UK this is one of her strongest tracks to date. Up to par with ""Crazy"" which reached no. 5 it is strong, danceable, has a great beat, awesome lyrics, wicked vocals, and is very catchy. Here's my track-by-track review of ""Stronger (CD SINGLE)""1. Stronger (Album Version) (10/10)One of my favourite tracks of hers to date. Her Max Martin & Rami make this a Britney Spears classic. You've seen the awesome video on MTV and MuchMusic which features a hot chair-dancing routine like in a few older videos of other artists.2. Walk On By (8.5/10)It was rumoured for the album and true! ""Walk On By"" is a great ballad and should have been recieved by fans on her album Diamond sophmore effort ""Oops!...I Did It Again"".3. Stronger (Work In Progress Remix) (10/10)A great remix!"
1,"Looking for education, not brainwashing","This is a brainwashing video on the Global Warming agenda. This is not at all like the original schoolhouse rock videos that just taught facts. Having one or two videos on recycling and conserving water and energy would have been fine, but the whole DVD? Glad I borrowed this video and did not actually buy it."
3,Fondue Recipe Assortment,"Rick Rodgers writes in an easy to read way and offers reipes that are easy as well. Fonduing is fun, but since you don't do it every day, having this book is a comfort for review and recipes."
4,The White Party 2000,Dj David Knapp does a great job with this CD. He mixes a good blend of anthem songs and trance with one song blending well into the next. I have not stop listening to it since I got it. The beats are strong where they need to be and soft in all the right places. I am sorry that i do not have the cover here to tell you what i feel about each song. I have been a fan of David's since i first heard him while he was still in Miami. If you like David already you will not be let down. If this is the first time you have ever had the chance to hear him you are in for a treat. This will be a great addition to any dance collection and will be a hit at your next party.
4,Good but not has good has happy nowhere.,"Don't get me wrong there is some good songs on here, Innonence,With my heart in your hands,vertigo,and propeller girl is alright but I still like dog's eye view - Happy Nowhere better.This should not be missed"
4,Very good helmet,"It's a very good helmet, is confortable, easy to put on and the design is fine. The only thing are the belts, that aren't so confortables as I thaught."
1,Very disappointed.,This was a terrible product. I was not able to get sound after a day. The flashing light that came on for the short bit of time it worked was really annoying. The earbuds are terrible. And I am sending it back for a refund. Do yourself a favor and do not buy this.
4,USB Mic and headphone socket,"I have Turtle Beach headphones with mic excellent but too hot for me. I like the Sony MDR W24 headphones but no mic.I haven't tried the earbuds that come with it because I don't like earbuds.It replaces the soundcard, so you must go into control panel and change it to the USB sound card on the unit. The sound quality is good and the mic sound check picked up a near whisper with good sound quality also.To me the LED light is annoying so I covered it as I have plugged into the front panel."
1,Don't Waste Your Money,"I am a big George Harrison fan. Even to the casual Beatle fan there is nothing here for you. No interviews with his rock friends Clapton, Lynne, Ringo, Paul. No insights into the man or his music or his character, (unless you are interested) in what he was like 50 years ago.Better labeled as a worthless piece of plastic vs a tribute to an inspired musician and kind gentleman."
5,I love this book!,My name is Diane and I'm 8 years old. You should buy this book because it's funny and great! It's great because I like rhyming books. My favorite part is when he was painting himself. If you like rhyming books this book is right for you.THANK YOU!!!
2,"Good story, but, Southern English","This is a good story and concept.But, buy this if you want your kid to learn Southern English.When we read it, we replace the Southern English with the correct words."
2,Not Double Strength - false labeling,"False advertising - product has the same potency as the regular strength product. I like the product, but prefer honest labeling."
3,Cosamin DS,"I ordered cosamin DS double strength, they sent the normal cosamin DS, so I didn't get what I ordered."
1,Battery compartment to small for battery packor vice versa,When ordering this train set there is a number of accessory items listed be aware if you order the rechargeable battery packs they do ot fit the train I'am still playing E-Mail tag with Amazon and the seller over my purchase very unhappy this was a surprise gift for my 4 yr old grand son.
2,STAY FAR AWAY FROM THIS!!!!,"Do NOT get this train! This train is not well made,and it does not run on electric track! The one you should get is the O gauge Polar Express that runs on electric track, is better made,and DOES NOT USE BATTERIES! I personly do not like this train because it`s windows in the cars do not light up! The windows in the O gauge light up! I do not like this train at all!!!!!!!!!!!.......but if you are looking for something cheaper you should get this!"
3,"Fun sounds, problematic track","This train has great sound effects--bell dinging, chugging timed with speed, and I can even understand what the conductor is saying--so the audio quality is good. The train runs smoothly in both forward and reverse settings and is a joy to operate. I deducted two stars because I had a lot of trouble keeping the plastic track sections together when they were in the circle configuration. When I tightened one connection, another one would pop open. I finally gave up on the circle and, using a couple of straight track pieces, made an oval. That worked, but I suspect that, over time, the track connector tabs will either deform or break. I kept the train because my grandson loves it. And since we will use it only at Christmas time around the tree, maybe the track will last as long as I do."
4,As advertised,"Nice looking, sounding train. Good for around the Christmas tree. Glad it turns itself off. Uses a lot of batteries."
1,Does not work for more than an hour!!!,"Just purchased this beautiful train set as a welcome home from the hospital gift for my son from his newborn brother. As it was for christmas, we ordered early as i was headed to the hospital to have the baby, so we set it up on christmas eve under the tree. My son loved it, and was able to navigate the remote without a problem. The issue we have is that the train worked for about 1hour total before it stopped functioning! The train powers up and the whistle buttons work, but when you position the remote to move forward or backward, the engine shuts down. Its not a battery problem, as we quickly replaced them hoping it was a simple solution. It seems to be a potential fuse problem, or defective train altogether. As we ordered early due to the baby's arrival, we are now outside of the 30 return window for amazon. We have no way to replace the train with a working version for my very disappointed son & are out the $$ as well."
3,"My son loves it, but I don't...","The train is sturdy and of fairly good quality. I purchased it for my son's 6th birthday, and initially he played with it for days on end; however, I became frustrated when every 10 minutes he would call me in to snap the tracks back together. They require a moderate amount of fine motor skills and strength to engage, and he couldn't do it himself. It's a great train but not suitable for all ages/abilities. The rechargeable battery pack is a MUST. The train is too heavy and will not operate correctly on standard batteries."
4,Beautiful Toy Train,"I have loved trains since I was a child. I own both the ""O"" Guage and now the ""G"" guage versions. There are differnces between the two, but those who love trains usually know what they are buying before they purchase it. This G guage is plastic, not metal like the O, but it is wonderful nevertheless. It has all the magic of a toy train, beautifully built, great sounds, nice electronics that make the engine slow and speed realistically, and the wonderful extras like the ghost on the roof who disappears when you flip him over. I love this train and anyone who know Lionel, will understand and love this train. I give 4 stars because the track does not snap as good as it could, but no problem."
4,True Polar Express details- SANTA DELIVERED!,"The details, sounds, ease of remote control sounds and features on this train are GREAT! The size, for a 3 year old used to wooden Thomas tracks was impressive as well. Please remember it is a TOY, and not made for the little tykes. Only caveat is the difficulty at getting it on the tracks and at snapping the tracks together, adult help is always needed at least for snapping together the tracks. But we knew he was young for it at the time we got it. He still gets it out as often as we'll let him (his favorite spot to set it up is the kitchen floor) and is thrilled to show it off to all his friends, with no signs of use so far. That's pretty amazing considering how much it has been ""loved."" I bought it at $200 (a big purchase for us) for Christmas of 2009 and have never regretted it. Now I'm hoping for switchers. I'm hoping Santa can help with this, because I just can't find them. Help me Santa!"
2,Somewhat disappointing,Got this for my nephew for Christmas; assembly was very easy and product seemed to be of good quality. However it did not work very well at all; the train kept derailing and/or stopped running due to a problem with the remote control. Troubleshot it thoroughly and repeatedly but did not get any results so returned it for a refund.
4,Lionel Polar Express,"This was a gift for grandchildren. They loved it. The only problem is that the included batteries were not good, and we had to go out and purchase new ones."
1,Defective unit,"Unit arrived defective (would not move though I could hear the motor running).The return experience was excellent. Packed it up, attached the pre-paid return label, and sent it off. I was credited within 3 days."
4,Happy with the product.,We were very happy with the train. My four-year old grandson was VERY excited with it. I would recommend it to anyone.
4,Nice train set for the money,"A bit plasticky, but still a nice set for the money. I am by far not an expert on trains, but it is big and looked good for around our Christmas tree. Track stays together nicely and I have had no battery issues. The connectors for the cars don't work great, so they do tend to come apart on the tracks, but for a Christmas train @ $100, not a bad purchase at all."
4,GoodChristmasGift,"We got this Polar Express train for our 6yr old for Christmas and he loves it! It's a great train for this age, since he knows to be gentle with it to avoid knocking it off the track. He loves the sounds it makes and especially the remote to make it go fast/slow and forward/back.The train was fun for a month and then he grew tired of it, mostly because it just went around in a circle and he couldn't add more tracks or create his own longer track.Our 3 year old wanted to take it off the track a lot and became frustrated in getting back on the tracks, so not a fun toy for under 4yrs old.So, I'd say it's a good Chritmas gift, but don't expect it to last all year."
1,Disappointing and dangerous,"We bought this for our son for Christmas. Having read the other reviews, we were prepared for it to have limited battery power and so stocked up on brand new Duracells. Sure enough, when it arrived, it did not have enough battery power to make the wheels turn and all batteries had to be replaced immediately. When you switch off the remote, per the instructions the train itself takes another 10 mins to stop flashing lights and making noises. There is no on/off button on the train itself. This was irritating in itself. Eventually it stopped, we took a break for lunch. Later, my son switched the remote back on and burnt his hand as it had overheated. My husband took the remote off him and as he took it the batteries exploded over him. We have packaged this up to return. This is a dangerous toy and thoroughly disappointing. We will not be buying another."
1,Polar Express Can't Leave the Station,"We love the train. Unfortunately, the remote control is missing so we can only look at it under the tree. I'm going to contact Lionel to try and get a replacement remote control. Will update once the company is contacted. Sorry we couldn't enjoy it Christmas Day.Update: Lionel Customer Service was helpful and sent a new remote out right away. Unfortunately, the train still won't move. All the sounds work perfectly, the track hasn't come apart (as some have stated), but the train won't go at all. It sounds like it wants to move, but it won't.I am so disappointed! I am going to return this item. My son is devastated!"
4,Another Sappy Romance!,"In true Nora Roberts style, the woman is hard headed but soft at heart, just waiting for the love of a man like Chase! I liked this book a lot because it's just sappy and sweet and romantic. Eden has to overcome her fear of men and has to find a way to stand on her own. Chase however owns an apple orchard and knows she is capable of everything she wants, yet it takes him a long summer to show her that he believed in her all along.It's cute, sappy and it will make you want to go to Camp Liberty for that long summer's night by the lake.BW~"
2,White Fire falls short,"I was very disappointed in this Cassie Edwards novel....it falls short of her usual wonderful work. Set in Minnesota, around Fort Snelling, the story line is too predictable. In fact, I found it to be superficial. Were it not for the Minnesota setting (my home) I would have never read past the first chapter."
3,"cute, but annoying","i know many baby toys are annoying to adults, but the voice on the ""pal"" drive us crazy! however, it does play classical music and that is cute. my son likes it, but the buttons are hard to press for a young child (10 months or younger)."
2,Not impressed.,"I bought this based on the reviews, and because I thought it would be nice to attach to his stroller, or a shopping cart, but I have been disappointed. We have had this since before our son was born. The music is nice, and my son likes the colors and will occasionally walk around holding this by the handle. The big issue is: it is not interactive. The ""feet"" are too short and fat for a small child to hold (and they don't do much anyway- maybe a few textures?), and at 13 months our son still cannot turn it on or press any of the numbers (it is very difficult to get the music to play- esp. for the target age group). If we turn on the music for him, he likes it okay (esp when he was smaller), but at this age he prefers if he can do that himself. I am just not impressed with this toy. There are much better toys for texture exploration, and you can find other toys that play music on the go. This is one of our toys I would pass on if I had to do it again. HOpe this helps!"
2,The buttons really are hard to press. Really!,"I was going to buy this online, but happened to be in Babies R US today so I went to check it out. WOW Those buttons are tough! And the area to press them is really small. And I wasn't really pleased with the sound (seemed annoying to me). I'm glad I checked it out before buying it."
4,Yes the buttons are hard to push,"My son has had this toy since he was about 7 months old. He is now 2 1/2 years old and every time I try to move it to the donate pile since it is a baby toy, he fishes it out, pushes a button and starts doing silly dances around it while laughing. We both love the toy. The color/number songs are catchy and fun and because of the classical songs (as well as the names of the composers), my older son can name a lot more composers than I could at that age. YES the buttons are hard to push. I don't know why they did that when it is supposed to be for babies. But when my son was younger, he would just play with the bottom parts (crinkle, rattle, etc) and wait for me to push the music buttons. Then when he was maybe 1 1/2 he would push them himself. Overall, I love the toy (can't believe that it is costing twice what I paid for it though)"
4,Manu Chao - Babylonia en Guagua,"For Manu Chao fans, this DVD is awesome. Recorded in 2002, it highlights Chao with his band Radio Bemba Sound System. Includes footage edited from two live concerts, a tour documentary and another documentary that is edited with lots of music and artwork. Highly recommend for new and current fans of Señor Chao. Pris ses nuits! ¡Esperanza!"
4,Some Try Other Nail it.,"When there's so many Djs or wanna be Dj's trying to put a mix together, It's great to hear something from someone who know what their doing. Great MIX!!!"
1,Lost it before they had it,"Before this CD, there was a demo floating around that displayed the talents of a D.I.Y band on the verge of breaking onto the national indie scene... The entire demo front to end was amazing. Then along came Bob Hoag's inability to mic studio drums, Aezra Records, and an ousted Braden McCall. The end result is The Rumor, an extravegant yet pitiful shadow of what Before Braille was once capable of. This CD is overbearing and ironically severely lacking all at once. Additionally, lead singer David Jensen sounds like he needs to lay off the tranquilizers."
1,Item is in Italian!,Nowhere did I see anything that stated this movie was in Italian and sent from Italy. It took FOREVER to receive and my son was greatly disappointed when it wouldn't play in his DVD player due to the wrong region. I contacted the seller and he didn't seem all that concerned but did give me an address to return it. I didn't bother but I will not buy from this seller again!
1,nogood deal,i purchased the 25 pack at a club store for ten dollars less than what is offered fron amazon site. online is not a guarantee of the best price. do your homework.
5,Great Value!,I have been using Gillette Sensor Excel cartridges for the last 4 years and they are a better value than the more recent introductions to the market. Its performance is comparable if not better than similar pricier products.
2,I DID NOT LIKE IT,"What made me dislike the book so is the fact that Theodora is portrayed as a weak character. This milktoast of a woman never stands up to the man with whom she is in love with. Like the entire novel she lacks the flair and passion necessary to make a successful romance story. As far as the ""hero"" being a badboy he was anything but that. To me he was a spoiled boy accustomed to getting everything he wanted. Wayward Angel was my first novel by Patricia Rice and unfortunately reading it did not turn into a pleasurable experience. Now whenever I am standing in the Romance section of any bookstore I make it a point not to look at any of Patricia Rice's novels."
2,Same as another book,DO not buy this book if you already bought Kaplan California Star Program Workbook: Grade 3. They are exactly the same.I don't know why Kaplan Inc is doing this but that is deceiving.
1,Question for the 5 star raters of this book,This is not a rating but a question:I am confused by the people who gave the book a 5* rating. Other reviewers have mentioned GLARING mistakes (the screenshots for one chapter being placed somewhere else ..??)Are these mistakes (which I as a novice learner would consider a show stopper) not there or how did you rate the books with 5 stars? Did you hit the problems experienced by the other readers and if so how did overcome them?I'd like to think customer reviews are honest and fair - that's the only way they're helpful.So comments please by those who read the book before I decide to buy it.Also a word form the author/publisher would be helpful. i.e. errata information ...???
4,"Not bad, for the money","In general, I liked the book, and it's definitely worth it if you don't know much about JSP (which I didn't!). Some of the chapters on HTML and Homesite were overkill, but the rest was helpful. The chapter on the shopping cart was the best, by far. All in all, buy the book if your a beginner, but if you want a JSP reference book, try another one."
5,Everyone's Favorite,"I am a professional nanny, and like all good nannies have a carpet bag filled with tricks to entertain and amuse the litte ones. By far and away the most requested video/dvd in my collection is ""Puppy Love"" with the gentle Kipper and his friends.This is a collection of stories revolving around the idea that Kipper is a friend to one and all. The darling ""Mouse"" is onboard, as are Tiger, Pig, Arnold and others.The values expressed in their little adventures consist of honestly, compassion, loyalty, and doing a good turn. Kipper really models how to be a good friend.And, its FUNNY! No matter how often we have viewed the collection we always get a chuckle if not an outright guffaw!The whole series of Kippers is worth having, but two are standouts--""Puppy Love"", and ""Kipper Helps Out"" which has the oft-requested episode of Kipper and a novus ghost. Kids really laugh at that one.If I could only have one video to share with the youngsters it would be Kipper's ""Puppy Love""--no contest!"
3,The only item that works reasonably well in this entire system...,We've rated (1 star) the entire Lotus system in another review. The spray bottles we purchased are outliving the system that crashed last year. They seem to be well made (they should be--they're expensive) and still work pretty well.
5,The Greatest Memory of Ephat,"This CD is a perfect introduction to Mbira music, one of Zimbabwe's great gifts to the world. Ephat Mujuru was a master. He set the standard for all mbira players in Zimbabwe until his tragic death in 2001. Thus album will give the listener a good idea of why Ephat was so loved, and how he used his music to bring people together."
3,Not An Introduction To An Introduction,"Some universities recommend potential linguistic students to read 'Teach Yourself Linguistics' in order to see if studying this interesting subject is really what they want...That's pretty astonishing! For the book is not 'an introduction to an introduction' as its foreword states. It is more of an outline, with more deep-cut analysis of whatever the author happens to feel like going deeper into. The book can also serve as a reference on terminology.But that's all, really...Furthermore, it is far too theoretical and schematic. The examples are always taken from the same languages and are often very far-fetched.It is a pity, for the subject does need a basic introduction book, a point to start. The best feature of 'Teach Yourself Linguistics' is that it might serve as an appetizer for what particular branch of linguistics one would want to explore further."
3,More a survey than an introduction,"This book should have been titled an introductory survey rather than an introduction. The author paid way too much attention to some subjects while other were just summarized. With its poor organization, this 250-page book had it's moments but was not succinct enough to serve as a good primer."
3,"Cool looking product, but not as clean as it looks.","The OmniMount TRIA Adjustable Shelf Wall System w/ Cable Management is an awesome idea. It looks clean and neat in pictures, but didn't turn out so for us. First off, you have to make sure that you have a stud in the wall where you want to place your shelf. The shelf is pretty heavy. I bought this without checking to see if there was a stud directly below our TV wall mount. Since we don't have a stud below our TV, we had to install this on the side (which looks a little funny). We are still trying to figure out how to manage our cables so it can't be seen. Some cables are shorter than others. We will probably have to buy some kind of cover for the cables. Overall, it's a neat concept, but make sure you do your measurements and homework first before buying."
3,Missing Installation Instructions... How Do I Install this thing?,Plain and simple... It's been sitting in the box for 4 months because I can't find instructions on how to install this puppy. I could use some assistance
4,Simple,Overall it's a good concept and a fairly clean look. It held up some heavy items i have and didn't show any signs of stress. I do wish it came with more cord covers or you could purchase more that were the same size.
4,only flaw is not enough room to hide cables,"We really like it. Seems very sturdy. Looks great. I'm not even close to being able to get all the cables to hide under the grey plastic in the middle. With power cables and video cables etc it just can't cover them all. But other than that, we love it."
3,"It's not perfect, but ""It's Alright"".","I guess the only song I really knew from them was ""Bittersweet"", and was the reason I got this. But after just one listen, I realized that I also knew ""It's Alright"", and the excellent opener ""Broken Hearted Savior"". Any occasional radio listener should know these. ""Turn The Light Out"" and ""Circle"" are great too. The whole disc is good though. To me, their sound is a little bit bar band, and a bit jam band, but mostly just good simple blues-rock. Nothing earth-shattering, just good. I don't think they ever had any ""monster"" success, but that's probably a good thing, they might get a ""big head""."
3,"Decent, but not the best","I got this CD with high expectations on the reccomendation of a friend, but was not blown away. It definitely has some good songs, but the sound wasn't new or exciting and the cd has definitely not become one of my essentials. It's good, it's just not great."
1,Deceptive Product Image,"The cable looks nothing like what's shown in the picture. It is actually a very thin, frail blue cable. It almost looks like some home made jerry-rig. It does work but it doesn't look like it will pass through any type mild abuse or even normal use for that matter. And it's crappy and overpriced, considering its terrible build quality.As for sound quality, when dealing with a digital signal, it's not really applicable. It either works, works intermittently, or fails. Albeit, its bandwidth is important. So in that respect, it does pass 7-channel audio (Dolby/DTS) through just fine. However, the real question is how long before it snags or gets folded and begins to fail."
4,she didn't let the right one in,"I was in the mood for a thriller so i pick this film at a used bargain price. It was a good blind purchase. This french film has a minimalist style, there is no suspenseful music just a woman with her baby in an isolated summer house and a stranger,which makes the womans actions and choices more intense becouse you know at anytime something is going to go wrong. The image is sharp and the colors are good the film is a little dirty but that is ok it gives it the grindhouse look. The sound is good. Extras include a short film called A Summer Dress,an interview with actress Sasha Hails,and a theatrical trailer"
4,I Want More,"I enjoyed this book very much - the plot was good the characters were excellent and it was a fast read. I have also read her other three books: ""Red Sream"", ""Under the Beetle's Celler"" amd ""All the Dead Lie Down"".What I want to know is.....has she written any more???"
5,Worth The Money,If you are looking into using your TV as your computer monitor than ANTEC TVator is what you want. It instantly turns your computer into a DVD player and video game console. And it does all of this in the most economical manner. You can't find a less expensive scan convertor anywhere.
1,Way Way overrated!,This book comes acrose as a peak in Fischer's mind on how to become a great chess player. Does not do anything but drill you on mating patterns. Dont get me wrong Fischer is one of the greatest players ever but his book is disappoiting. Great to look at just for some mating drills but thats it.
3,Good starter book.,"I bought this book when I was in grammer school, and recently purchased it for my wife. The book does not hold together, however, it is inexpensive and it provides a good introduction for a new player."
3,The Checkmates are still fun,I have read the bad reviews. But if you are looking for a book on how to checkmate then this book is ok. It is true that title makes you think there are lessons and instead you get a tactical checkmate solution book. It is true that maybe Fisher wrote it and maybe he didnot but I do not care. This book certainly isnot the best but it isnot the worst.
2,Doesn't match up,"If you are looking for a good book on ""How to Checkmate"" get ""How to Beat Your Dad at Chess"" or even Polgar's massive Puzzels Book. Fischer's book has very little material in it is is dated because of much better books of the same nature. Looking for a good instructional book: if a kid, adult or teacher get ""Chess For Juniors"". If a classroom teacher consider getting ""Teaching Chess in the 21st Century"" in addition to ""Chess for Juniors""."
2,Not very useful as a book to learn to checkmate from,As a book that only covers how to checkmate it has so few problems compared to every other book I have seen that covers checkmates that it is a waste of time and money. The checkmates were so simple that as a beginner I went through about half of them in five minutes and stopped after that. Even for a beginner it is worthwhile to get a book with more examples and one that explains the different types of checkmates.
2,Checkmate Problem Workbook - Not Formal Instruction,"Bobby Fischer Teaches Chess is a book that extremely basic checkmate problems to work on. The title implies that there is formal instruction. However, there are are no formal lessons, just checkmate problems to solve.A player new to chess should be learning to use chess notation so that they can move on to other books. What a beginner might at first think is good, NO CHESS NOTATION in the book, doesn't allow him/her to get use to using notation. This is actually a serious drawback.There are much better books containing tactical problems and checkmates available. I would recommend ""Winning Chess Tactics for Juniors"" by Hays or even better yet, ""Winning Chess Tournaments for Juniors"" by Snyder as far superior books that actually contain both problems to solve that have both winning material and checkmates involved - far more practical."
5,Excellent course for beginners,"This book is arranged in a very logical and easy-to-understand way. It is also very easy to read at any place since it doesn't use any notation. This book clearly points out the fundamental ways to checkmate, which is one the the very first thing beginners should learn."
2,A disapointment,"When I got this book I discovered just how little real material it contained. It uses up a lot of space to cover very little. And, this book is very outdated in the since that numberous newer books have been written that cover far more material and provide text that tells you what is going on. Some examples are ""HOW TO BEAT YOUR DAD AT CHESS"", ""ART OF THE CHECKMATE"", ""1001 BRILLIANT WAYS TO CHECKMATE"". Look at these books first and you will not be disapointed."
2,Not the best instruction book,"I don't understand why this book sells so well. The other reviews tell it well, but I want to stick my two cents in too. It is not a horrible book, just not a good book. Each page has one checkmate to find. The checkmates are not hard to find unless you are a super beginner. It doesn't tell you too much about what is going on. I agree with many of the other people doing reviews that the book is not an instruction book so much as it is a book on checkmating positions. I do not care if it was really writen by bobby fisher or not. That is not the point that some others have made. The point is that is is not what the title tells you - it should be called ""FIND THE CHECKMATE"" or something like that. I also do not care if it has chess notation or not because you can learn that from other books on chess. I own 1001 BRILLIANT CHECKMATES by Fred Reinfeld and CHESS FOR JUNIORS by Robert Snyder. They are both much better books anyway."
4,Nice book; good for beginners and advanced players.,"If you want a good book on checkmating, then buy this. It's nice and cheap, and will most likely improve your game (especially if you're a beginner). It's simple, and a chess board is not needed. Although I got a little bored of the same questions, this is a must-have for people who are starting off and wish to improve."
5,Fun and useful,This book is just a joy. Potential purchasers should understand that it is roughly 350 pages of chess positions/problems to be solved. Its fun and very very useful. I live in New York City. My biggest problem with the book is that I get so engrossed by the book that I have been missing my subway stop!
3,For Beginners,"Don't expect too much from this book. While informative and a good practice, it is not really an in-depth look at anything. Rather, it gives you different situations and runs you through them. It is easier to follow than many chess books I have read, but not that full of content."
2,Not the best beginner's book,"The title makes it seem that this book has organized lessons by Bobby Fischer. In fact there is very little written text. It is basically a problem book with very simple checkmates.A lot of space is used (very big diagrams) and not a lot of material is covered.This being said if you are looking for a good problem book for beginners I really like ""Winning Chess Tactics For Juniors"" by Hays.If you are looking for a great first book that really teaches chess using lessons then there is no better book than ""Chess For Juniors"" by Snyder."
1,Not worth the cheap paper it is written on,"Ok! Fischer, the greatest world champion of all time wrote this? I cannot believe he really wrote this book. It has oversized diagrams, over simple problems for the absolute beginner and it contains almost no teaching text. Just simple problems with answers. I am only 12 years old and I could write a better book than this (maybe I will change my name like movie stars and authors do TO BOBBY FISCHER then write a book with the name on it and it will be a good seller)."
1,Very Disapointed,"I got Bobby Fischer's book thinking it had good lessons like a teacher would have. Instead it is a bunch of simple checkmate positions that are easy to solve - one page and one position! Junk! Total junk. I should have read the other reviews that pointed this out before getting the book. I have the book ""Simple checkmates"" which is much, much better if you want a book on ""simple checkmates"". Checkmate is the end result of a hard contest and is not what I need to learn."
1,Not enough Material and doesn't provide explanation,I am going reviews on several books that cover checkmates and rank this book at the bottom along with the Kid's Book of Checkmate. You will want to see my reviews on Art of Checkmate and 1001 Brilliant Ways to Checkmate which are the best books of this type.Simple and to the point: Bobby Fischer Teaches Chess doesn't cover very much material using an entire page for one checkmate situation without explanation - just a simple solution. As pointed out by others it doesn't teach beginners to use chess notation like it should.
4,A thorough review of some basic ideas,"If anyone else had written it, I would have given this 1-2 stars, as a dull and elementary book. However, it is interesting to see what Bobby Fischer thinks is important for a beginner -- a thorough understanding of basic tactics.I much prefer his 60 memorable games ( isbn 190638830X), though of course it is at a much higher level."
3,"Mainly for beginners, this book has good, but par tactics.","Bobby Fischer Teaches Chess is a good book for starters. With precise endings and not so precise openings, this book might need some more diagrams from Fischer's actual games with Spassky, Keres, and others."
1,Must Be Kidding - Bobby Fisher,"This book is really written by by the world chess champion bobby fischer?Gosh, I thought he would give me some real stuff to learn. But it is all easy to do checkmates.If you are looking for a real book with great problems then get ""how to beat your dad at chess"" or the great tactical section with checkmates and other problems to solve, ""winning chess tournaments for juniors"". Both wipe this silly book out big time. Check the reviews on those books!Bobby Fisher teaches chess takes an entire page for just one problem to solve. And it doesn't teach reading moves like a good book should. I gave this book to my friend but maybe I am not helping him."
1,Monkey Business!,"I did not like Bobby Fisher Teaches Chess because,#1 - It is a space waster: uses a lot of space and doesn't cover much,#2 - Doesn't do chapters breaking the type of checkmate down: I like the books like ""1001 Brilliant Checkmates"" that gives you a chapter on the type of checkmate - the Fisher book is not consistant,#3 - There have been a lot of newer books written covering more checkmates and giving you explaining.#4 - The checkmates are for pure beginners and most beginners do not need to just learn checkmates but have all parts of the game covered like in ""Chess For Juniors"".These are all the reasons why you would want to look into the other books first."
1,You gotta be kidden!!!,"I recently got this book in the mail - as a not so strong player I thought it would be helpful.Poor me, but then lucky me that it was cheap (in more way than one - the paper is so cheap I will likely long outlive it before it starts yellowing and the binding already came apart).The material in it - well I went through the entire book (almost) in one sitting - I got bored with it before I finished. I must be better at chess than I thought. In reality it will not outlive me as (this is absolutely true) I needed get the fire going in the fire place. Yup, you guessed it! Ashes to ashes, dust to dust this book was so easy not getting it for you is a must!This book is REALLY BAD."
4,An excellent teaching tool!,"There isn't much I can add to the other comments above except that this is an excellent way to teach chess to elementary and middle school aged children (especially those that are not particularly good or avid readers). My middle school team won a trophy (4th in the state of Virginia in 1997) based almost solely on instruction from this book and Fred Wilson's little book, 101 Questions on Chess (that book, by the way, is only $1 -- I bought all 24 of my kids a copy and it surely had something to do with that trophy). I asked the parents to buy Bobby Fischer Teaches Chess and the kids that got them ended up as my better players."
5,BOBBY FISCHER TEACHES CHESS,"Our whole family has read and re-read this engaging treatment that teaches us to look deep into the game to see what is there. It teaches you to THINK chess, in a fascinating manner. There is no other book like it -- even children can use it. At chess club we started, we recommended it highly for those beginners who wanted to boost their skills. I am so glad that Bobby Fischer shared this simple, and delightful teaching with the world!"
3,bird egg food,my bird did not care for this product and he usually loves egg diet. glad i bought the small bag.
3,Scientific Facts not Accurate,"I enjoyed this book (and others in the series) with my three girls when they were little who all are now twenty-somethings.As a geologist, it was grating to see dinosaur model toys being referred to as being from the Pleistocene!! (the age of woolly mammoths, sabre-tooth tigers, dire wolfs etc.)We wrote a letter to the Berenstains and got a cute letter reply from Papa Bear. He said they would correct the mistake in the next printing. OK, that was well over 20 years ago, and the book is still the same. Sigh! And people lament that our children are uninformed about science.Now that my youngest daughter is about to get a teaching credential to teach science in elementary and middle school, maybe it's time for her to write another letter."
4,Finally my DVD burner works!,This is the only brand of DVD's that I have found that can be successfully recorded by my lousy Plextor PX-716UF DVD player/recorder.
3,A NEED,"The product was just as advertised, arrived when they said it would, priced right and does the job I bought it for."
5,Great Interlinear!,"Dr Mounce just loves teaching greek and this book continues to show it. The size is larger then I expected, but it was very welcome. The type is very clear, most interlinears cheat with small fonts.I'd recommend this book for all."
3,"Great music, terrible mix.","I have loved Gino Vannelli's music for many years. I saw some of these performances with The wonderful Metropole Orchestra online and bought the dvd as soon as I saw it offered.The music and arrangements are great. Gino is in fine form and the Metropole Orchestra is outstanding as always. And having Otmaro Ruiz on keyboard and piano was a big plus for me.However, the mix is terrible. Gino is behind the orchestra's sound with way too much reverb. In a couple of spots you could see Gino is singing, but you don't even hear him.I am a musician myself so maybe I am more sensitive to these things, but I can't believe any prchaser would be happy with the sound of this dvd.A BIG disappointment."
2,"Flawed by second tier piano playing, but Brecker is fine.","Having heard Brecker with authentic piano giants like Herbie Hancock, McCoy Tyner and Chick Corea it is a disapointment to hear him with a piano player (Joey Calderazzo) who is not up the task of being his main foil as a soloist. I would rather hear Brecker in a Tenor, Bass and Drums trio than hear him with what sounds like a talented Berklee student on the piano. I would love to hear Brecker more with Hancock - the piece Scriabin on an early record was stunning."
1,IF YOU DON'T MIND PIRATED FLICKS,"Waited quite a while to get a copy of this movie. Was utterly disappointed when I finally played it and found that appears to be a pirated copy. The video quality is below 8mm home movies. The resolution is 640x480,aspect ratio 2.31:1. If you like the classic old movies don't buy this from this seller it's a rip off!!!! Gave it 1 star because there were no negative ratings!!! [....]"
5,Looking for this one for a long time.,"I have been looking for Moment To Moment for quite a while and I was very happy to find it at Amazon.com, and at such a great price. The video arrived very quickly and in perfect condition. Thanks I am happy to own it now."
4,This movie has everything,"Arthur Hill, Honor Blackman, the stunning Jean Seberg and a Mancini sountrack, are part of this well kept secret called Moment to Moment. I saw this movie about seven months ago and have been trying to locate a copy since then. I loved the whole movie especially the part at the outdoor cafe when the doves fly off. Honor Blackman was great as the carefree neighbor and Arthur Hill the neglectful husband. But Jean Seberg's portrayal of the neglected wife was terrific. I'm going to add this to my collection.A Fan,S.A.Thompson, Author ofWhat's Done In The Dark"
5,The Writer at Work,"'Writer at Work' is a high quality, thoroughly wonderful collection of Richard Krzemien's unique cartoons about the writing life. From the superb renderings to the pithy punchlines, each cartoon is a work of art in its own right. The keen eye will note the bookshelf in each drawing with a message specific to the cartoon written on the book bindings - a bonus addition to the cartoons. Funny and poignant - these cartoons can be enjoyed by writers and non-writers alike."
4,Nice and Easy,"The book came in a timely fashion along with its ""Creative Drawing"" counterpart and has been exactly what I needed for my art class at school."
5,My Favorite Grant Green,"Let me start by saying that I'm a huge fan of Grant Green. Since my first listen to ""Idle Moments"" I've tried to listen to all that he had to offer, which includes some pretty cool finds on vinyl. His work on this group of songs is just incredible. Grant's playing is fantastic and the rhythm section just keeps it flowing. The bass work by Ben Tucker on ""Grant's Dimension"" & ""Alone Together"" is incredible. The sound quality of the disc is great."
4,Happily covered,Easy to assemble and adjust. Seems to be durable and well constructed. My son has a different model that usually cost's $150-200 more and I'd say it is just as well made. Product arrived in a reasonable time. Over all I can find no reason not to recommend purchasing this product.
2,Morbid Huh?,"Whats the big deal with Morbid Angel? Everyone told me that they kick ass. I went out and bought this CD and was very dissapointed. The production sucks, nothing really stands out at all. The only song on here that is remotely good is ""Angel Of Disease"". Overrated band if you ask me"
5,DEATH METAL AT ITS FINEST!!!!!!,"Yes, I will join these other people in saying that this is probably Morbid Angel's best album to date (Gateways To Annihilation comes close mostly for the fact that I like Steve Tucker's voice more than David Vincent's. Not to mention every track is great.) Songs like ""Rapture"", ""God of Emptiness"", and ""Angel of Disease"" are some of the best songs these guys have ever written. And I think I can say that Pete Sandoval is one of the best drummers in metal music and its a shame that he doesn't get the right attention. I have never heard anyone do double bass like him. Buy this now."
1,good gawd,suxxxxxxx!!! dont understand what was goin thru their heads when they were makin this album. Musta been a bad trip or sumthin.
1,Woodman,"I am looking for a block heater for my Chevrolet pick-up, I was led to this site and this product, Now from what I can see of this thing it does look good, But just what is it? You do not have a good discretion of it anywhere. I don't know if it will work on my truck or if it is for a milk tank. Thank you I'm still looking for a heater for my truck.Don the Woodman"
3,four or five good ones,"For me, four are interesting enough to stand independently of the great Eagles' versions. In the order they appear on the CD:Desperado by Clint Black; Tequila Sunrise by Alan Jackson; Lyin' Eyes by Diamond Rio; and Sad Cafe by Lorrie Morgan, the Don Henley, Glenn Frey, Joe Walsh, J.D. Souther peon to the Troubadour and half a dozen other gone LA venues of founding country-rock."
1,I HATE IT.....NOT WHAT I THOUGHT I WAS ORDERING!!!!!!!!,"I thought I was buying this in a CD, not a cassette tape. I am very disappointed. It is almost impossible to find a cassette player.I threw away the shipping package or I would definitely be returning this item. Not happy with this purchase at all. I feel like it was a total waste of my money.Is there anyway to return this item and order it in CD?????"
3,triste y melancólico,"este no es uno de los mejores libros de cortazar, ya que es de 1977 y las dictaduras estaban en toda américa latina, cosa que lo entristecía mucho, y eso se nota en sus relatos -flojos en su mayoría comparados los mas conocidos y geniales. el tema de la dictadura está bastante aludido y un cuento trata sobre eso. el mejor de todos (para mi) fue uno de vampiros, y tambien bastante interesante alguien anda por ahí, que dá titulo al libro."
5,"What an honest, tender book!","I was so impressed by the honesty and tenderness throughout this book. Kathy and Dee put a very fresh perspective on a subject that some consider to be a little worn out, and made it relevant to both single and married people. It goes straight to the heart--the heart of the matter, and of the reader. While it was written primarily for women, I believe that there is also a great blessing for the men who read it. Be prepared for a magnificent change in your life!"
1,A real Snoozer,"Like most of Troccoli's books this one is gushy and a real snoozer.If you have ensomnia this book ought to cure it,at least it stands a good chance of doing so.Troccoli usually references the Message Bible. It is anything but a good reference.It is so distorted from the King James that it should not be considered a reliable source at all.Well,it might make a good poetry book.Save your cash on this Troccoli book and buy something you'll actually enjoy."
4,Works really well!,"The product is nice and it conditions very well, but i gave it 4 stars since it comes in the mail in the envelope but when i take the lip balm out...there is no covering on it or case."
5,An excellent book. Jump on the waiting list!,This is an amazing and insightful book... thus also extremely damaging to certain groups and organizations with a vested interest.Does it surprise anyone that it's out of print? 'limited availability'. Shocking!
1,Description of product is wrong,"Lens set includes rings 27, 28, 30, 30.5, and 34mm....... is what the writeup says.....but what you get is 30, 30.5 and 43mm adapter rings.....since my camera has 27mm, I was unable to use kit. Waste of time and effort. Description is wrong...."
4,No Complaints - Works Good,"After much Amazon and other research, I bought this router and have no complaints. This was my first attempt to setup a wireless network and it was very easy. The installation CD worked as expected and connecting the router was simple enough. My wired network functioned perfectly right away and a few minutes later my wireless network was also on-line and functioning perfectly. I know others have had some problems with this router, but I have to say my experience was good and I would recommend it."
5,Pleased with Belkin,"The range is far, the quality/speed is great. No glitches or restarts. The only ""problem"" was that it took some messing around with the ip addresses and such before it started working. Called Belkin, they had me do a few things and it was fixed. I'm pleased!!"
4,Belkin Router,Router performs well with 2 notebooks attached. Extra PC's doesn't seem to degrad throughput. Not too hard to set up. Good product overall
4,Making Sense of Central Asia,"Olivier Roy is a well-known expert on Islam, the Arab world and Central Asia. His The New Central Asia is an excellent examination of the creation of new nations that emerged from the end of the Soviet Union in 1992. He contends that while these new republics are in search of identity (in essence creating new nationalisms), they have also inherited the older Soviet system of rule and institutions, which were not democratic and more oriented to personality cults and heavy-handed treatment of the opposition. This explains the difficult path countries such as Uzbekistan and Tajikistan have had through the 1990s and into the next decade. For anyone looking at the problems of development as well as wishing to obtain a better understanding of a pivotal geo-political zone, Roy's well-researched book is worth the read."
5,More German Warriors,The usual men-at-arms quality and concise coverage of all facets of the topic. This second title on the armies of Medieval Germany is illustrated by the late Angus McBride and reveals some of the bizarre costumes and armor decor of the knights and mercenaries of this period.
2,"Great Artwork, but the Writing is a Mess and a Bore","Men-at-Arms is a unique series, but unless you really want to fully dive into Medieval Germany pass on this book. The best part of this book was the detailed artwork, but search Google for little while and you can get similar art.The writing is a terrible mess. It is unfocused and confusing. He does not write in any general direction and meaning. Reading any other book on this topic by choosing pages randomly would be smoother than German Medieval Armies.Save some money and don't buy it."
5,Works on EVERY DVD player I have tested it on,"I do wedding videos as a side gig. I have tried MANY different brands and formats of DVDs. I was starting to accept the fact that there was not one DVD-R or RW out there that would work on EVERY DVD player. I bought these on a suggestion from my brother and after several tests, I have yet to find a DVD player they WON'T work in! And, since they worked so well I invested in an Epson Artisan 50 that allows me to print directly on these DVD labels which works flawlessly as well. A great combo!"
2,Can't read this particular brand/type on one of my computers,Can't read this particular brand/type on one of my computers. Tried different brand - it worked. Apparently they are cutting costs and it bites.
4,The unchained memories by Leonore Terr,"Although I have not finished the book yet, I do feel a need to respond to the review by Casey Lytle, who said that the father had been cleared of this murder by DNA tests. I just researched the case. The DNA tests cleared him of another murder he was convicted of, not this one. He walked free of this murder because of a mistrial. The daughter had been hypnotized prior to her recovered memory, and had failed to disclose that fact to the court. The prosecutor chose not to do a re-trial because he was uncertain that, in the absence of the daughter's testimony (which could not be admitted if it was obtained under hypnotism), they would be able to obtain a second conviction."
2,Very Disappointed,I was really disappointed with this frame. It was a Christmas gift for my boyfriend who is a huge Carolina fan. When I unwrapped it I noticed that it had a thin black film on it. The film eventually came off after twenty minutes of rubbing. Naturally I wanted to put a picture in it and the screws on the back were virtually impossible to loosen. I had to enlist a friend to help me and we ended up having to use WD-40 spray which stained the cardboard and even then the screws got stripped. This product is definitely not worth the price!
5,Watch this movie and spread the word!,"Dan's movie and message are just what the world needs right now. Check this film out and tell your friends. It's funny, fun, moving, thought-provoking, and good-hearted."
3,So true and to the point,"Good video for all christians to see, it focuses on what we believe and what we do and how we appear as Christians when we do what we do.If we want to show people what christ has taught us, we had better take a good look at how we distort our truths to fit our wants. This goes long to make people , non-christians, be suspect of our intents. The video covers it all and you will see things that you might not have believed."
1,"Not ""Fair and Balanced"".","The intro looked like it might take a legitimate look at the issue of personal belief systems. The guy walks around with a coverall with a Darwin fish and several heretical symbols on it. The story then descends into ""How us Christians could have done a better job about expressing our message"". Sophomoric. What a horrible piece of crap. You invite me in to the conversation with the pretense of reconciliation, then you mock us? Good job!!!"
5,One of the best math books out there!,"My son is almost 8 years old and he seems to be gifted at math. The regular old workbooks and math curricula out there just weren't enough for him, or for what I wanted him to learn in math. I love how the problems in the book apply to real life situations and the problems really make the child think. This is one of the few math books I've found for children that I would recommend, especially for gifted children. My son can do the level 2 problems so far, but I do have to help him on level 2. That's great, because then he is pushing his limits and when he figures out the answers, and he lights up with pride."
4,well organized,I like how well organized this book is. It does a great job of explaining math concepts step by step. Great for a classroom or enrichment at home.
1,I hope women aren't really like this,"I agree with the reviewer who lamented the time she will not get back after reading this book. I was excited to read it (having enjoyed the movie ""Must Love Dogs"") and thought that the style of writing entirely as a series of one-sided e-mails was intriguing. However, the main character's total self-absorbtion and whininess got old really quickly! She essentially stalks her neighbor, while constantly complaining about her inattentive husband. She is insecure, and - did I mention - whiney! Her most annoying characteristic, though, is her total and complete selfishness. As she is going through her mid-life crisis, she never thinks of anyone but herself, including her children, and shows no strength of character in her choices or actions. I'm glad I don't know this woman - I would quickly tell her to grow up!"
1,Not good.,"Amazon said it would fit, Lund said it would fit. It didn't fit. I have a 2003 Supercrew and it was a foot too long. (Yes I know there are 6.5 foot beds, but I don't have that...I have a 5.5...again, Amazon said it would fit.)Even if it were a foot shorter, it didn't accomodate for the curvature of the bed. Crappy design crappy product. If you don't want to make one for this truck, that's fine, but don't advertise it as fitting if it doesn't."
5,good product,This is a nice way to keep a 5 yr old busy. They can make their own cards and give to family and friends.
3,make your own cards,This is a craft product that requires a little supervision for the younger child but it is a fun project.
2,Fighter Pilot Tactics Review By B.J. Phillips,"This Book is different from other books that the title say it is about tactics... Mike Spick did a very good job on getting the facts right but, if you are looking for a book on how to execute and conter manuvers like the sissors this is not the book... the title says tactics on it but it does not describe any tactics in detail..."
4,Bought this used to replace my broken 404 card,Slipped it into a PCI slot and fired up the computer. Reinitialized the drivers and it works great. I use it to stream live TV to my phone or tablet on the go. Standard def video works well for this type of viewing. Thanks
2,Not at all what I expected,"I bought this book thinking I was buying a supernatural thriller, perhaps with elements of horror thrown in, and if I was lucky, there would be some interesting legal footwork as well.I got almost none of this. What I got was a piece of Christian literature, and I am not commenting on the value of this, but it simply wasn't what I was expecting. To add to this general disappointment, the writing was weak, the characterisations poor, even the grand romance didn't have any ring of truth.Quite simply, it was a disappointing read, and by the end I barely cared what had happened to any of the characters."
3,mystery?,"When I bought this book, I thought I was buying a mystery. Wrong!It would have made a good one. It's a mystery at the start and end. Everything in between is a love story. Too bad, because the mystery part was good."
1,Sea Sick,"This video was disappointing. The 52-53 minute duration is an exercise in agony. The video itself is difficult to watch due to the excessive glare and shadow. With the exception of the charter guide's opening demonstration of trolling to net bait and his explanation of fishing on a changing tide there is little else to learn. The two fishermen in the video are poor informers, demonstrators and are just unpleasant company on this trip. Should you ever find yourself in a boat with them, check your GPS and you'll find you are in the 4th level of hell. The second part of the video features a ""lady angler."" Seasoned female fishermen will find her stereotypical if not insulting. This video is a wash. I own many fishing videos from Amazon.com. I have never received one that I wanted my money back. This one I would like a refund and an apology. This is my second attempt to warn customers of this video. Amazon must have found my first review too scathing."
1,Need a magnifying glass,"I should have known at the price that this would be a really cheap version. The print is so small you need a magnifying glass to read it. If the description had included that caveat, I would have opted for the more expensive edition. Just didn't think about it ahead of time."
2,Don't bother,"There are many more chess books than anyone could ever read, so you have to pick them well. That means skipping this one. Chernev was a great teacher, but this book is not one of his better efforts. If you're imagining that by reading this book you will learn traps you can use to win games, think again: the positions you see here are unlikely to arise in your games; if they do, you won't remember them; if you do remember them, the time you spent on the memorization would have been better spent studying tactics. Get one of his other books."
5,Great toy,"This is so much fun for adults and children alike. Teaches color, matching and other characteristics of common farm animals. Tolerates a mismatch and sings a silly song. The pieces all attach to the back for travel and at home can be hung on the fridge. Been thrown by a two year old and still works great!"
4,Not bad,"We got this item along with the fridge phonics set. This one has been put on the back burner for the time being. It does get occasional use, but my 1 1/2 year old has a hard time getting the pieces into the space correctly. So, he drops the pieces and goes to find another toy. However, I'm sure he will get better, as my 4 1/2 year old sits down and plays with this too, just to hear the singing and keep himself occupied while I cook. It does have a cute feature where it sings about mixed animals when you pair them incorrectly. It's okay, but probably would not buy it again."
2,Misleading Picture,"This is probably a good product, but it has a ""choking hazard"" for children under 3, and a picute of a cute baby holding the product...., and the kid is under 3."
3,It might be more fun for older ones,"Overall, this is a cute toy, but it doesn't hold my 17-month old's attention very long. I was hoping it would buy me some time in the kitchen when making dinner. It has also taken her a couple of months to figure out how to fit the animals into the base correctly. She does enjoy the music though. I think she will enjoy this one more when she's older and better understands what is going on and how to get the pieces in and out."
4,My son loves this toy!,"We got this as a Christmas present when my son was a little over six months old and it went in the closet until he was older. I pulled it out when he started pulling my refrigerator magnets off and he has loved it ever since. He likes the sounds and fitting the pieces into the slots. My only compaints are #1 that I have to constantly chase down the all the pieces because he won't use the toy on the fridge and the pieces end up scattered throughout the house, and #2 I wish there was another set of animals that you could purchase that were interchangable with the existing pieces."
4,"""A pig-cow? That's silly!""","Overall, I think this is a great toy. My daughter loves farm animals and music, so this is a good combination. Able to keep her interested for a good amt of time. My main concerns are as follows: if you choose to not store it on the fridge (because our Leap Frog Fridge Phonics takes up most of our fridge surface), it is VERY hard to keep track of the pieces, they do NOT stick to the back of the toy like they're supposed to. also, the songs/sayings get a little monotonous for adults to listen to (although my daughter loves them). So a few beefs, but overall an excellent toy with fun and educational value."
3,A neat toy with some issues,"We purchased this set for our son on his 2nd birthday, within just a couple of weeks the set stopped working. We replaced the battery, no luck. We contacted amazon and within just a few days had a new one. The new one does work and it is very cute, my son loves it! The animals make the appropriate noises when you put the two correct halves together and makes funny animals up when you add for instance a horse and a cow, however, even the 2nd one we received doesn't work quite right. It sounds like the batteries are going dead, even though we replaced them with brand new ones. All things aside my son and daughter still love the thing and my son has learned the sounds for the animals he didn't know before!"
5,Best fridge toy ever!,"My daughter loves this toy! She loves the sounds the animals make, the songs that the little chicken plays, & the songs that play when you match or mismatch the animals! I love the fact that it all goes on the fridge. I really like that fact that the magnets are not exposed and can't be pried out by little teeth.I did have to help her for the first few days. She had a hard time with getting the magnets to go inside, but now she can do it all by herself.I love this toy. It's cute, fun & educational."
5,He loves it!,"Got this for my 2 yr old grandson, he didn't need any instructions! He just started playing with it as soon as he found it on the fridge! Kept him busy for awhile. Should help to keep him busy in the kitchen while his mama is busy cooking supper. (I should have gotten it for him last year.)"
5,Awsome Toy!,"My daughter loves fridge magnets and they are the only thing that lets my wife cook dinner. My daughter loves this thing! She pulls it off, pushes the button to play music and is just starting to put the pieces in herself. Excellent toy and cooking aid!"
2,I should have spent more money,"It looks cheap, it is cheap. I bought it to have it on my desk. The way it is attached the coffee filter cup, all that area it is awful.Other than that coffee taste great, it takes a long time to toast a bagel."
5,Love It!,I purchased this item as a Christmas present. It arrived quickly (which was wonderful as I had waited until the last moment to order!). The receipent was extremely happy with the breakfast combo and has used it daily without any problems. It is small which is ideal for small kitchen or spaces. For one person it is perfect.
1,Can't believe...,"GROSS! While preparing this I kept saying to myself, ""I can't believe I'm going to eat this"". After I took one bite I said to myself ""I can't believe I thought I was going to eat this."" So yeah pretty nast. The noodles on their own smell funky.Btw I am definitely not a health nut."
3,Okay for a quick meal,The final product looks nothing like the photo (I count 1 piece of corn and about a handful of slivers of carrot that maybe adds up to 1/2 cm cube of carrot). It's fine though for a quick meal. Very salty though. Good texture noodles.
2,Edible.,"I think I've had this flavor; they're all so bland it's hard to distinguish them. Not to worry, though--the portion is so small it'll all be over soon! I've tried several flavors and they're all forgettable. I give up. The people who love them must not get out much....."
5,My very first JSB novel - and I'm hooked.,"I picked this book up because of another author and I've found a new favorite. It's a fast-paced courtroom drama, full of believable characters and a plot that kept me surprised to the last page. The crime is straight-forward and the antagonist is definitely guilty, but the path taken to the last page - well, it's NOT straight, that's for sure! This is my first James Scott Bell novel, but I'm hooked. I like Grisham and Grafton, but Bell is now my choice for this genre."
5,Nice one,"I have a few Classic Rock DVDs. This one is well made, infact it is quite intelligent for a rock band.Roger, Jon Martin Birch (the 6th member) are the main speakers and give some good insights.All the songs are covered but for 'Lazy' and 'Maybe I'm a Leo' which are really missed.Ian Paice dosn't say much and Ritchie is a minstrel (He He)Though there is nothing really new the whole package is great there is good footage too, sadly none of the performances are complete except for 'Never Before'Worth buying"
5,This is an amazing resource!,"This book contains instructions for making just about every imaginable type of puppet: cloth hand puppets, finger puppets, glove puppets, paper bag puppets, cup puppets, stick puppets. . . It has patterns for making a story apron, including instructions for creating scenery on the apron. It also has suggestions for puppets to go with specific children's books, poems, or songs. There are puppet making activities for children that are appropriate throughout the elementary years. It's full of photographs and amusing illustrations."
1,Sad,"well as so many have said, these are not the songs in the movie. I was hoping especially for ""Big Dream"" but also hoped for the other songs Samantha Mathis and River Phoenix sang, even though they were covers. Also would love to have Dermot Mulroney's songs. Very sad."
3,Decent But Not Great,"I bought this soundtrack thinking that it would include the songs that River Phoenix and the other actors sang in the movie, and was really disappointed to find that they were not on it. The CD only included the versions of the songs by the original singers. The songs are decent, but I honestly think that the actors made them sound better, especially the talented Mr.Phoenix!"
2,Also dissappointed,I was very dissappointed that the CD didn't include the songs that river phoenix and samantha mathis sang in the movie. If anyone has those songs then please email me.
5,AWSOME MAN :),DAZED AND CONFUSED IS MY FAV SOUNDTRACK I JUST SLIP IT INTO MY CD PLAYER AND LET THE BABY TRACK WITH A COLD ONE IT'S ALL ABOUT THE MUSIC..
1,Pardon me...,Did I read the same novel? I read this book wanting to discover an author I've never read from before. Out of all of the myriad of novels I've read in the past couple of decades I have to say this was my least liked. The writing was sloppy and the story line was too basic. I pointed out so many writing and grammatical errors. How could a book like this get published? Hmmm. I am appalled by the sterling reviews this book has had and I feel I must give my 2 cents worth.
5,reality horror,"J.K writes stories that scare the pants off you because they are stories that can happen.I also got a kick out of the novella at the end, ""the passenger"" excellent stuff!"
2,minus horror,"The first chapter of this book shows incredible promise; dark, malicious, moody. A dog gets shot in the head by some mean-spirited rich kids. Aha! A tale of vengeance.Unfortunately, the first chapter is the high-water mark and each following paragraph spirals into sentimental and meaningless exposition which never seems to scratch the surface. There was a premise here, something with which Ketchum could have pressed further into, and we the reader would have been treated to a real macabre insight as to what makes people mean, what revenge does to the person seeking it, and what happens after that.Instead, Ketchum treads softly, tapping into fear like the Sci-Fi Channel taps into science fiction, amusing ridiculous characters and simple-minded explanations then wrapping it up quickly so he could go to bed or watch CSI.I knew there was a reason I rarely wander from the literature section. Some writers just don't have the balls."
3,Just OK if the price is right...,"Your average flannel sheets...I haven't had them long enough to say if they wear well or not. They're soft and feel nice enough. The quality looks nice enough. I got them on a great Gold Box price, so it was definitely worth the price for the set. A comparable set in retail stores would easily go for upwards of $40-$60."
4,I think they're great!,"I thought these sheets were very nice; soft, and haven't pilled after 3 washes. The only reason I didn't give 5 stars was due to the enormous amount of lint after washing. Not being a flannel sheet pro, I don't know if this will slack off in time, or if it's normal. As long as they retain their current state, they were a super bargain for the price."
3,details not quite right,"This book is very readable, interesting and engaging. The story is gripping, however the author takes liberties with some of the details and stretches others - for example, one person mentioned in the story supposedly explored out West when it was the wild west, yet when his age is given, he would not yet have been born when the west was still wild! I suppose you could call it literary licence but some of these details just don't add up. Was this hurricane really the only category 5 to hit the US? What about the Galveston Hurricane in 1900? This is disappointing and confusing to me, but the subject matter is enough to carry the book."
5,Fantastic read,"As a life-long resident of New England and more recently of Westerly, RI, I was fascinated by the story of this hurricane. I applaud Ms. Scotti's writing and her ability to pull you into the stories of this great storm and rivet you to your seat. I found this to be a very fast read just because of the fluidity and tempo of her writing and the fascinating details.Read and enjoy and marvel at the wonder that is Mother Nature."
5,Excellent Reading!,"I really like this book. Its very interesting. It tells the readers exactly what a hurricane is like. Some people may think that a hurricane sounds exciting. However,after reading Sudden Sea: The Great Hurricane of 1938 one quickly realizes how deadly and destructive hurricanes are. I was glad to find the book. There really aren't a lot of books written about hurricanes.The book arrived on time and was in good condition. I would definitly buy from the seller again."
1,This product has gone down hill,I was very pleased with my first under the counter radio/cd playerplayer. After three years the volume lower button wore out so I had to replace it. I ordered the identical player but it was terrible. I can play store bought CD's but the radio reception is terrible. I can't get all my usual stations and there is a lot of interference. I would definately recommend NOT to buy this item.
4,nice player,"Sound is good, but it could be better. It also skips easier than some, but overall-it's a nice player. Love having the extra space on my cabinet and having music in my kitchen when I'm cleaning and such."
3,"OK, but buttons wear out...","Pros: Good sound, Solid CD player, decent FM reception, compactCons: Fragile volume buttons.We have had this item 4 years and initially loved it. Good sound, compact, and really saved counter space. Unfortunately, after a year of only adult use, the down volume button on the unit died. a few months later and the up volume button died. Now, the buttons on the remote are dying so it takes several attempts to turn up the volume.We like it enough to buy the new model from Sony and hope it has more rugged buttons!"
1,Don't Buy!,Target can do better and should stop selling this unit. I am on my second unit with same CD player failure waiting for the third replacement. Sony will not refund or give exchange voucher for a different unit. Target will not stand behind the unit either. Normally Sony products are reliable but not this one. I'm sorry I bought it.
1,Two pictures and it crashed!,This card crashed on me right out of the package after taking two pictures on my birthday. Very disappointed. Now I have to go through the bother of sending it back and waiting for a replacement.
3,Bok pages didnt look new,the pages looked like they were ripped out from another book then compiled to make a new book but i'llgo with it nevertheless I wont return it
3,A pleasant read,"This book by Morgan is very interesting to me. Some may not find it interesting because it tells the story behind the writing of various hymns but to me it was fascinating reading. Good research and I enjoyed it.J. Robert Ewbank author ""Wesley's Ways"" and ""John Wesley, Natural Man, and the Isms"""
1,Then Sings My Soul and Then Sings My Soul Book 2,I was very disappointed in the quality of these books especially since they were purchased as gifts. The covers were stained with printer's ink and the pages indicate that these books were proofs and not final copy.
5,book review for Then Sings My Soul,"This is a great book for those people who were raised on hymns. Today it seems that hymns are outdated and used very little in many churches. I find that I really miss them, so when I do my devotions I use this book and am able to read a little history about each hymn and can also 'sing' it. I would absolutely recommend it."
4,"breaks my husband up, every time","As many times as we have watched this film, my husband breaks up every time. Quinn is magical. What a talent. He is Zorba again but in Italy this time."
4,tragi-comedic gem,The Secret of Santa Vitoria is a delightful tragi-comedic gem about the dehumanization of war and keeping priorities straight. At first the characters seem one-dimensional but gradually we see them change into more complex people. The high light of the film is the amazing human ladder to save the wine which propels the story.
3,kind of dry for HOMESCHOOLERS,"This was a decent resource, but I recommend instead:Reproducible Maps, Charts, Time Lines and Illustrations: What the Bible Is All About ResourcesI especially say this comment for homeschoolers!"
2,Nelson's map review,I was a little bit disappointed with the layout of the book - visually it was not very attractive - and I am sorry to say that it did not help me in the project that I was working on at the time.
1,Not anything like the Word Connect of Windows 98,"Very disappointing. The board is about 1/6 of the size of the old board; talk about boring. If you played the Word Connect, using Windows 98, you will not like this game. There are very few tiles to play with, too. If you are looking for a Scrabble type game, this is terrible. I had been trying to find Word Connect, like the one I had on my old Windows 98; thinking the name was the same, I thought I might have the fun again of a complex game--WRONG! I tried installing the Puzzles and Games, but that one is installed, but it won't open. I have XP, so there should not be a problem! I cannot in good conscience recommend this game set. I wonder why EGames cannot make Word Connect the way it was on Windows 98, which was big enough to take up the whole screen. This Word Connect is about 4 inches by 4 inches; in addition, there are little chances for increased letter and word scores."
2,To many different loads in this game.,"you have to download like 6 different times for the 6 different game titles. Then in each game title you have to download another countless number of times for game has a few more games in them. It was just to much I felt. Most of the games were just not easy to figure out. I don't recommend this game. Even though you can purchase it for about $10. It still just wasn't worth it. Put it this way, If I lost it I wouldn't repurchase it, even at a clearance price. The reason I did give it two stars rather than none, is it did have some jigsaw puzzles which I personally like to do. With these you can make them your screen saver when you finish it. YOu can choose different puzzle piece shapes and choose how many piece. You pick out a particular animal to puzzle together. Then you choose if you want to do it in 20 pieces or 500 pieces. etc. That was kinda neat, but still not worth $10."
1,Word Mania,This is an okay product. I expected more of the games and just didn't get it.The order was received when stated and there was no problem with the physcial part of the product itself. I orded Bookworm and Bookworm Adventure and was more pleased with those products.
1,This book is So BAD,"This is the second (and last) book by this author that I will ever try to force myself through. The plot (if you can call it one) is laughable, the characters are dumb and the conflict is a joke. The heroine is too stupid to live. She has a gun with her when she is taken hostage by the Blackfoot chief that she all too soon and in awful purple prose comes to love, but she doesn't use it to try and free herself or her brother. Then there's the story line of a chief taking his people away from their beloved Montana to settle in Missouri and be farmers. Give me a break. This piece of trash isn't worth lining a bird cage with."
5,"Use force, Luke!","Dr Mumford has done it again! His eloquent and entertaining way of guiding us through our own labyrinth of fears and out into the bright light of understanding is easily comprehensible to all. Karma is like a force - we unwittingly 'force' others to treat us a certain way. To step out of that pattern and become aware is a great achievement. The word karma is seen more as a past tense noun (although it is a verb), but seen from the Christian viewpoint, it is expressed as ""It is done unto you as you believe"", and ""Do unto others as you would have them do unto you"" - this is present and future tense, which is how we should see karma. Karma is something we have brought with us to this moment, and it is our decision, with each breath, what we take to the next moment, or breath. Breathe light into your energy flow - use the Karma Manual to deliver your love."
5,Good range,"The manufacturers of another, more expensive, 30 meter wireless keyboard refused to comment on whether their product could send a signal through walls. I can use my Grandtec from a room that is about 60 feet away, and seperated by two exterior walls. It is lightweight and yet stable/well balanced. I like the mouse. It is better than any I have ever used on a laptop keyboard. It is big enough to guide with two fingers, which increases its precision and ease of use."
1,I've had nothing but trouble with this program,"It's been difficult to install, difficult to work with.

The drop downs appear on the wrong monitor if you are using multiple monitors.The only redeeming quality I've found so far is that there is an importer that manages to barely work somehow.

4,Good Mysteries with Hot Investigators,"I'm a huge Rufus Sewell fan but I digress, this is a very good show. It may not be exactly, scientifically accurate but all of you who aren't die-hard scientists will enjoy it very much. The first episode premiered in October 2008 and the last aired in April 2009.The extremely smart Doctor Hood (Sewell) is a widow who was hired by the FBI to investigate scientific crimes. He dumbs down the scientific conondrums of each episode in a nice way and his character is very humble. Don't think that this show is only for the uber-smart, there is lots of action too! With his FBI partner (Marley Shelton), the two chase down bad guys, save victims, and solve crimes. Some topics to get you even more interested include cloning, savant-ism, and frozen bodies in sunny California. This first and only season (the show should have had multiple!) has 18 episodes on 6 disks! I highly suggest that if you're contemplating this buy, get it!"
3,A Kernel in the Pod,"I was excited about this book since I am planning on attending school to become a Physician Assistant. I was a little disappointed in it's content and I guess my expectations were high. It was more about this PA's ministry and really didn't fit what the life of a PA would be in a hospital setting, per se. Although I sound negative, it was entertaining."
4,the sound and quality you expect,"This is very good music.The crisp,clean,meticulous production and the top notch musicianship that we havecome to expect from the Steely Dan boys is all here in spades.Walter does all of the singing on this album--and his quasi-Dylan vocal style fits right in.On the occasions when Mr Becker lets loose with his rocksolid,tuneful guitar solo breaks it is pure joy.As stated,this disc contains 11 songs--none more than 6minutes long.The tunes are a hopping mix of bop-bluesand synth driven laments.The lyrics have uncanny depth andperception.I will provide a short sample:DUSTED DOWN IN SHANTY TOWN BEHIND A SKY OF REDHOIST UPON SOME FROZEN DAWN EXPLODING IN MY HEADFAST ASLEEP IN TROUBLE OR WIDE AWAKE AND BURNINGSTUCK INSIDE SOME SOME STRANGER'S HIDE WHOSEKARMA KEEPS RETURNINGsong #5/Lucky Henryif you admire this type of deep,poetic songwriting along withthe aforementioned crisp S.DAN sound--then this discwill be a welcome addition to your collection.It was to mine."
3,Something's missing.,"11 Tracks Of Whack has a few moments where it shines. Becker's voicings on guitar chords are spectacular as are his lyrics. However, something is missing from this album. Becker's voice is weak and monotonous, and on the majority of the songs a horrible sounding drum machine is being used. I respect Becker's desire to not have an overly busy drummer on his album, but the drum machine just sounds horribly cheesy. It's rare that any one thing on an album distracts me as much as this has. The songwriting and musicianship are all there, but something's missing... a drummer!"
4,Good Disc,"I really dig Walter Becker he is very talented.Junkie Girl,Down In The Bottom&Little Kawai are the cuts.the only knocks for me is that I Prefer Donald Fagen's voice better.that's about the only real difference for me.but Both Guys are Equally Talented Otherwise."
2,Too Much Of The Same Thing,"This solo effort by Walter Becker showcases alot of what he brought to Steel Dan's music. The rhythms from the guitars and drums are quite funky in a slightly unusual way. The special effects particularly on Hard Up Case, Lucky Henry, and Hat Too Flat are quite interesting. However, most of the songs are very identical in song structure and style. Most of the songs consist of a few chords usually with the same progression repeated over and over again. Pretty annoying after a while. In addition, Walter seems to sing each song in the same manner. Furthermore, most if not all the songs seems to have a sleazy overtone to it. Just read the titles. After a while, this can really drain on any listener. There are a few worthwhile cuts(Down At The Bottom, Junkie Girl, Hat Too Flat, Book Of Liars) and a few good moments here and there among the remaining eight tracks. However, when compared to any of Steely Dan or Donald Fagen recordings, it rates as its title suggests."
5,Girl Scouts loved it!,"I used this book to help my Brownie Troop earn a badge. It was a wonderful introduction into discussion of helping animals. The exciting advenutre with its endearing characters is followed by a brief, but effective explanation of what children should and should not attempt with real wild animals. After hearing this story, the girls decided to take on a volunteer project at a local animal shelter. We are waiting for the next adventure of The Animal Rescue Club to see what it inspires."
3,good B movie,i like this movie. it's not going to win any awards but for a late night B movie it fills the bill.
3,Good recipes - a few errors,"I really enjoy this cookbook and for the price it can't be beat. Some of the dishes (carrots and peas) were too salty for my taste. But I have enjoyed most of the recipes overall. One of the recipes, Bavarian Sweet Rolls, has a misprint in the ingredient amounts - missing liquid of some sort."
2,Great German Recipes,"Just about every recipe is from the states. I miss lot's of main course dishes, soupes and desserts.I feel the price is way to high.There are many lands in Germany who have different Recipes and I couldn't find any that where from Hessen."
2,These don't work,"My husband purchased these heel cushions because they were recommended by his doctor for plantar fasciitis. I read reviews of this brand as well as reviews of other brands. This brand seemed to get the most positive feedback which helped him decide to go with it rather than another. Well, they don't work. He has been wearing them as directed by both the manufacturer as well as his doctor. They are not doing anything for his condition. We are both very disappointed in this product. He was really looking forward to getting some relief but he is not experiencing any."
3,New World Coming,"I just finished this book and it is fast-paced, enjoyable and generally informative. But the authors obvious liberal political bias makes one question his objectivity and accuracy. For example, his comparison of Florence Harding to Hillary Clinton is laughable. Love and desire may have played a role in her decision to ""stand by her man' but who can deny that greed and ambition played a larger role.If one is able ignore the authors snide political interjections, the book is a fun read."
5,Best and Only Forensic Art Text,"9Nov2000 Really exceptional, textbook quality but novel read! This book was used during a recent class by Betty Pat. Gatliff the famous Forensic Sculptor (chapters 11 and 13). Details of forensic portrait art and illustration from history to actual instruction with emphasis on identification of missing persons in drawing , sculpture, or composite from artifact facial bones or by other postmortem methods to reproduce the likeness including aging and other image modification. There are multiple case histories outlined and discussed. Karen T. Taylor has made a wonderful contribution for all future Forensic Investigation. I predict this text will be a ""must-read"" for lawyers/law enforcement, all artists, writers and also physicians such as myself in Forensic Pathology."
5,Forensic Art and Illustration,"Being a forensic artist myself and having the the opportunity to have received instruction from Ms. Taylor, I looked forward to the publishing of ""FORENSIC ART AND ILLUSTRATION"" with great anticipation. Suffice to say, I was not disappointed! Ms. Taylor's book is thorough, thoughtful, enlightening and a MUST tool for any forensic artist! It was easy to read and understand, provided excellent references and is a valuable addition to my forensic text library. I highly recommend this book to all forensic artists and believe a lay person can get a lot out of this book as well!"
2,Never felt this album...,"Personally, the best two tracks are 9 and 11 overall, if I had to like any of them. Unlike the other folks that rated this item, I thought the beats were sad on this album. I'm glad this album was Makaveli rather than Tupac because it just didn't do Pac justice to release this album under his name. I know there's a lot of folks out there that disagree with me on this but I've filed this CD away and chalked it up as something I won't put in my player ever again."
3,Its Sad,"It's sad to think that Pac went out making beef instead of making peace with everyone. So if you think about it, its dissapointing that his last cd wasn't made up of songs dedicated to his momz and songs that were deep.But that has nothihng to do with the quality of his last cd. Makaveli has a lot of good tracks, especially ""against all odds"" but it can't be compared to his other work. His best cds were ""until the end of time"" and ""2pacalypse now"", so basically only buy this cd if you are a big Tupac fan. This cd is good, but compared to other Pac cds, it's a joke."
2,The only 2Pac-album I don't like...,"I'm a big fan of Tupac Shakur (he's my favorite rapper), but I think he went too far on this album. He's dissing eastcoast-rappers such as the Notorious B.I.G, Jay-Z and Nas on almost every single song. It gets kinda boring, and the production is pretty dull and boring. The beats suck on most of the songs. I think this album is so overrated. Me Against The World is Tupac's best album. No doubt.R.I.P Tupac Shakur AKA Makaveli 1971-1996"
4,is good,"I love the sound quality, but it was a gift to a friend. They love it and for what I pay for is was a Great gift."
3,"No Swivel, Comfortable - Not","The seat and chair are made pretty well. But, the seat is pretty uncomfortable, very little padding, and does not swivel. I put the seat on my old chair legs (it swivels), but am going to have the old original seat re-upholstered and switch it back. If you want a decoration, go for it. If you want comfort, look elsewhere."
5,Love it! Another Pixar home run,"I just discovered this show... it was broadcast on ABC Family one day when I was packing to go out of town (so I didn't have time to watch it all then... went straight to my computer to order it). It ""had me"" in the first 5 minutes... laughing with delight. There are lots of aspects that appeal to children, but plenty for adults as well and it's really fun to watch. Be prepared with your remote to freeze frames occasionally, to catch all the details (like the captions on their eggnog/coffee mugs). I've watched this DVD twice already and probably will do so a few more times before New Year's. It's going into my ""favorites"" collection for Christmas... that's certain."
4,A new Christmas classic,The original episode is so charming and funny. The sequel was also fun but not as sparkly as the first. But this was an affordable DVD and a great addition to our Christmas movie collection.
5,Christmas elves the way they should be.,"There is nothing to dislike about this collection! THREE GREAT mini movies AND a fun short film!! This has become a Christmas favorite in our home and since the first movie is only 22 minutes long, we have already watched it six times this year. I truly hope this becomes a regular for Disney and that we see more future installments in Christmases to come."
5,super cute,Absolutely cute children's Christmas movie. Really holds their attention. Comes with Disney points for the collector in all of us.
5,Lisle headlight adjusting ratchet,"Ordered this tool to align new headlamps I installed in my ranger. If you're looking at this review right now, you probably already know how difficult it is to access the headlamp adjusters. Thats where this little bundle of joy comes in, making it nearly effortless to align ford headlight assemblies. And as always, Lisle makes an awesome product (which mostly tend to be made in the USA)."
5,4mm headlamp ratchet,"The price, the delivery time and the product met all of the advertised parameters. The product did the job very well. I am pleased."
4,Good product,The only complaint I have about the paper towel holder is that the ball ends could be smooth plastic instead of the rubber compound that was used.
1,Thick Paper towels cause a problem too,Looks nice but the roll does fall off and thick paper towels can rub the top edge of the unit closest to the cabinet. Item is being returned.
2,"so so paper towel holder, i'm returning mine","i just purchased this paper two holder today. like the last reviewer said, you can only mount this horizontally, not vertically which is a little disappointing. my two main reason for returning this are the large rolls don't fit and rub on the back of the holder and the balls that hold the rolls on are so big that unless the tube is perfectly round it won't spin. i'll look for something that has a bar that goes through the roll instead of round ends that hold it on."
3,How can you not put those 2 songs on?,"Well, I must say this would be one great classic rock compilation if they hadn't forgotten to put ""Sweet Emotion"" and ""Hurricane"" on here. I mean wow, there were 2 great scenes, and 2 great songs, it just doesnt make sense. Especially Hurricane, that has way too much meaning to not put in a CD with music from that era. Dissappointing, would be a 5 if it had those 2 songs."
2,nice but not big enough,nice product but it doent hold the amount indicated! length is too short for top row to hold bottles!
4,Great storage and good for transporting oils,"Love this case - it makes organization easy, holds a lot of oils in different size bottles and makes transporting them easy. I wish the case were made of leather and think its a little pricey for vinyl; thus I gave it 4 stars instead of 5. Still its held up through months of use so far."
2,don't pay for next day shipping,"the product was fine, but don't pay the price for next day shipping.paid $30.00 for next day shipping, got it two days.was told I would only get 1/2 shipping refunded. I paid for next day shipping because I needed it next day. Two days, I didn't need anymore.Paid for something I didn't get. Should have been refunded the full amount of shipping, instead of 1/2."
5,itty bitty book light replacemen bulbs,am so glad i was able to find replacement bulbs on amazon.com my light is probably one made when they were first produced and this is the 1st time i have had to replace the bulb
4,It grows on you...,"When I first obtained this CD, it was a mediocre alblum. After listening to it mulitple times I enjoy it."
2,I wanted to like it!,"I really wanted to like this book, I just couldn't get through it. The premise was confusing, and I found it the book boring."
3,"good advice, dated wardrobe","I bought this book used, so of course the patterns were not included. I used the Internet to search for the author's website to get replacement patterns which arrived in a few days. The styles are a bit outdated for the tuxedo shirt and the jacket, but the advice is great for use with other patterns. The t-shirt and both styles of pants are classics. I found the suggested notions like the elastic on-line as chain sewing stores don't have them. This book is OK as a starting point, but the author has newer books that provide more in depth sewing tips."
2,"No time, no patterns","Purchased used. Patterns were missing. Lots of good sewing tips, but I really wanted the patterns! I would purchase, again, if the patterns were included."
4,So you think you want to travel to a ran forest,"Eric Hansen's first person singular account of his half year spent in the rain forest of Borneo, Malaysia will entertain and educate at a lively pace. His experiences planning and living a barter existence cut off from modern society provide valuable insights to anyone contemplating a travel to a similarly undeveloped region.All in all, a good read"
5,A jaw-dropping premise for this book!,"What if Jesus became you for the next 24 hours--went to your job, came home to your family? What would he see? What would others tell him about you? In my opinion, Max Lucado's best book."
3,A touch on the surface.,"I must admit that with every new book this author writes, the better his depth and subject matter. Although still basic in scope (which is why he has to write so much), he explains in layman's terms what his mission in life is. I personally like a thorough reading over the ""super easy"" which is why this book does not break the 4 barrier. It is a quick read if you're on a plane and need some closure while reading."
2,Disappointing,"I was disappointed. I had heard good reviews from local christians, but the book was much more simplistic and less enlightening than I had expected. The ideas are simple, but he repeats them often enough to have the ideas sink in. For some, this may seem like manna. I was looking for more substance."
5,"If you want to start acting Just Like Jesus, read this book!","Wonderful book! God bless Mr. Lucado for his gentle, funny and very, very inspired way to present the Word of God.I read this book while traveling to work (for about a week) and people would look at me when I started laughing. They way Mr. Lucado explains and gives real life examples of how Jesus acted in every day situations is funny and entertaining, while teaching exactly what we need to know to improve the way we conduct ourselves to affect others and make them wonder what makes us act the way we do.This book thought me how to treat the people I dislike the most, as well as the people that surround me (including my husband!). The results? After I started acting (or at least trying, because we can never be exactly like Him) like Jesus would act in every situation that I confronted in my home, office, on the train, etc., things started to change! Because the attitude of other people changes when you start acting.. ""Just Like Jesus..."""
5,"Inspiring,practical and timely celebration of grandparenting","Roma Hanks celebrates the very special connection between grandparents and their grandchildren and the model those relationships set for all of us. Richly illustrated, the book is inspiring and also very practical. The format is interactive-the reader is encouraged to record their thoughts and feelings through a series of helpful exercises that are worth recording for the next generation. The timing of this book is ideal. The baby boomer grandparent-and there will be tens of millions of us-will appreciate this knowledgeable and sensitive look at perhaps the most precious of all relationships."
1,"Thin plot, too dark and scary for little ones","we only have three Barbie movies, this one is the worst. a lot of dark parts, my daughter cried several times when watching it. the storyline is absolutely ridiculous. Island Princess is a lot better movie."
2,Better for older girls,"After buying and watching with my 5 year old the ""Wonderful"" movies Princess & The Pauper, Island Princess & 12 Dancing Princesses I didn't hesitate to add this movie to her collection, however it was much darker & scarier than the others. I wish they would rate them somehow on the box. This one was also more modern & someone lost the magic of the other three."
5,A Hit w/ My Four Year Old,"My daughter LOVES this movie, and I must say, the music is rather infectious. A cute story about friendship."
3,NOT good for sensitive young kids!!!,"Parents BE AWARE: There is a very frightening-looking flying lizard character with an equally scary voice, a scray-looking troll that eats animals, and an evil-witch type character that turned other characters to stone and set fire to a house. My sensitive four-year old was afraid of a lot of the scenes in this movie."
4,oh that barbie!,"a fun story with a lesson for girls. Both of my girls loved this movie and the music!Cute, animated."
4,No trailer required,"They aren't kidding when they say white trash. It's a beautiful thing! It's tacky, tacky, tacky and a pure joy. the stuff under ""sinkin' spells"" has a special fondness in my heart. These are recipes you will return to. You have two choices with this book. Either show it to people and have a good laugh or keep it hidden away and never tell a soul. You can't do anything half way with this book."
3,Promenade,The tape case was a little worn. The CD was in good condition. There are two or three songs on the CD that I especially like.
5,Well worth the price,Very affordable for a one time party. What is lacking is a sword and a Somali speed boat. A fun costume.
1,NO HEAD TIE!,"Got the costume in the mail today. There was no head tie! I didnt buy a hat specifically for the reason that it came with a head tie, and now I have neither a hat or a head tie."
4,good fit,the pirate costume fit pretty good.the price is perfect for this item.I wore the costume for about four hours during a party and it was comfortable even with a lot of activity.I will buy from this seller again.
5,Delightful and Delicious,I love the chocolate preferably over the strawberry. The chocolate is rich and tasteful. The strawberry is bland and perhaps would be best mixed with strawberries in a blender. The best thing about these drinks is that they only have 90 calories and 6 grams of fiber. ENJOY!!
1,NASTY!,"I just had the chocolate fudge one. Please, before you order these, try them out first! It's disgusting. It tastes like coffee, and I hate coffee. I'm sure it will make me full, but I still have this grossed-out look on my face. Icky!!"
4,"Good, but not filling","I really like the flavor of the chocolate smoothies, but they're not as filling as I had hoped."
3,Worth it,"The song ""Bittersweet"" is a classic and worthy of your ""repeat"" mode on your iPod. Even if there are some moments on the rest of the cuts, had a hard time saving any others to my playlists. Still, Bittersweet alone is worth it."
4,Great ideas for dates,"Since I don't go out all that often, when I do I'm always stuck for ideas for dates. And since my women friends are getting tired of my bugging them for date ideas, this book is wonderful! Not to mention that my women friends are releived I'm not bugging them anymore. But seriously, this book contains literally a ton (well ok maybe more like 75 or 80) ideas for dates. And they are for the most part ""alternative"" ideas and not ones like the dreaded ""movie"" or ""dinner"" date. Things like live theater, train rides, planetarium or factory tours, film festivals, bird watching, etc.Not only are the ideas mentioned, but also background information about them. For example, the author lists playing pool as a date idea and then lists the different types of pool games there are. I never knew that. This is one book that I know I can refer to the next time I meet some nice lady and want to do something other than a movie.Now it's just a matter of finding nice women to go out with!"
3,"A Compelling read true, but is it accurate...??","While there is no denying the oppression of Dalits, the view presented in Vasant Moons account is very narrow and unfortunately in parts chauvinistic. One analogy that comes to mind is looking at the U.S civil rights movement through the eyes of a Black Panther activist. Then again this is an autobiography and perhaps it need only reflect the views of the author even if inaccurate..."
4,"Not the best ever, but worth every penny","Caveat lector: my favorite snowboarding movie of all time is ""That's It, That's All"". While this film, in my opinion, doesn't live up to TITA, it is still a killer film in it's own right. Worth every penny. Cinematography is stellar. Soundtrack is good. Riding is solid. It just didn't quite measure up to Travis and company's last one. But that is an unfair comparison. I doubt any movie will ever be as good as TITA. This is a close second. Travis kills it as usual. And the rest of the crew are no slouch.If you have never seen ""That's It, That's All"", buy this first, prepare to be blown away, and you'll be left wondering, ""How can any snowboarding film ever top THAT?!"" Then, go watch TITA, and you'll have your answer."
2,Disappointment,"I was so looking forward to this movie, and kept waiting for it to get better, but it just never did. If it wasn't for the disappointment (and maybe that's my fault), I'd give it three stars. There was more filler than action, some filler was way out of context (seemed like I was watching another kind of thrill movie), the mix volumes made the dialog too mute and music too grandiose and annoying, the team didn't work well, never seemed to gel, fighting, making mistakes, etc. I admit that it was heartening to see them work through their disagreements, and interesting to see the heli ice up and get stuck on a ridge - kudos to all of them for saving that situation and surviving. This movie would've been better if made as a documentary than presented as a presumed epic ski/board movie to thrill and entertain (for that, I really enjoyed Attack of La Nina)."
5,Beautiful Guitar Mastery,"This DVD is just as the title says, Celtic Fingerstyle Guitar.In each song, there is one Guitarist, one Guitar and no distraction from the pure beauty of the proficiently played Acoustic Guitar.This is a great video for anyone wanting to see 7 of the worlds best pickers do their thing up close and personal. This DVD would also make an excellent instructional video."
5,Now THIS was a fun purchase!,"I've been buying from Amazon for years. I've had good books, great books, good tools, etc. You get the point. I have had more ""fun"" with this than any other purchase.This is one of the few purchase I've ever made where I really feel like the author lives up to the billing. After having read about 10 - 15 of the reviews here, I can only say I echo what everyone else is saying -- to include the part about the cheesy caveman stuff. Distracting, but harmless.A great learning tool that I still enthusiastically return to after having listened and learned for several weeks!"
5,A Much Improved Edition,An excellent book to take the beginning harp player to the next level of playing. Jon teaches in a *very* informal manner enough theory to get by. But more importantly he teaches such things as the differences between playing solo and in a band. His love for the instrument shines through in this book. A must have for any budding harp player.
5,"Jon Gindick, Super Teacher","Jon is a natural born teacher. He has an uncanny way of making sense of music. Jon makes the harmonica ""easy"" and fun."
5,This One Tops Them All,"Over the years, Jon Gindick has produced a wealth of harmonica instruction books, tapes, and CD's. With Rock n' Blues Harmonica he has put together the most awesome package of all. The accompanying CD is incredible. Jon makes it fun!"
4,Its Good,"nice job between the book and the cd. Very helpul for beginners and well worth the price if you buy it used in good shape. And if you have the stick-to-it-ness to master what is being taught. Better than the first cd I bought, that's for sure!!!"
1,"Badly Written, Not Worth the Money","This book is painful for people who do not know Maya and it is practically useless for those who do. People somewhere in the middle may learn a thing or two, but overall I believe this to be a waste of money. If you have the program, you have the manuals, and they will play a better role in helping you with Maya than this book. The front cover is a testament to the rushed nature of this book, and the almost careless attitude with which it was released. The art samples, done in Maya from some of the tutorials in it, are [bad], and as soon as I saw the cover I became very nervous about the hard-earned money flying out of my pocket to the land of lost cash. In dire need of extensive re-writing."
4,A damned Good Book!,"I was a little hesitant about this book at first, it just didn't seem that appealing. I am happy to say that this book is a fine achievement. Where I expected battle after battle and typical pulp storytelling I find an exciting novel dealing with plots and labyrinthine conspiracies. There is a rich cast of characters, many of whom you grow attached to, but being a Black Library release you know that many of them are going to die. The only problem with this book is that the plot twists are ruined by too much foreshadowing, and at times they are blatantly obvious. Hopefully in his next book McNeill will be able to fix these problems. Don't be fooled by this being an ""Ultramarines Novel"" they take a supporting role and dwarfed by the large cast of likeable characters."
2,Nice video but too short,THis video was way too short for the cost. I bought it as a gift for my Dad however he was dissappointed.
5,Ninety Nine Cent Book Deal,"I was so pleasantly pleased on the condition of my book The Kings Daughter which is ""still"" in excellent shape, I was expecting to spend more on it and thought that I saw a typo of .99cents for this book, but I took a chance and needless to say I've already told many other people to now buy from Amazon.com for items they need going forward, I totally recommend to all!!!"
1,Dissapointing,The video is very short and does not explain any of the meaings of the rituals and sacrifices in the Temple.
2,Good while it lasts...,"This little controller is actually quite nice; nice size, good responsiveness. However; after a few months of normal use, the L and R triggers will no longer function correctly.More specifically, the little rubber ""spring"" inside will get stuck ""pushed"", if you follow me. So you on-screen object/character is constantly doing whatever it does when you push that trigger.I would not buy this product again. Spend the extra cash on something that will last longer."
2,not too original (plot spoilers ahead),"I'm a fan of Jean Auel, and am always on the lookout for other good prehisotry novels.I've read LA McKee's other books, so I know she can tell an original story. But this isn't one. In this book, a child loses her parents and is found by another tribe who distrusts her because she looks different. They fear their spirits won't accept her. The medicine woman and cacique (leader) take her in. As she grows, she wants to learn about weapons, which is forbidden. When she reaches adulthood, she is raped, and later banished. Sound familiar? If I hadn't already read ""Clan of the Cave Bear"" I probably would have enjoyed this story more; it's not badly written. As it was, I couldn't help laughing at the blatent similiarities."
4,a gem,"I first read this book about 3 years ago. I don't read many books by writers about writing, and I don't read many autobiographical books by writers, period. However, I read the first few pages of this book, and I was captivated.She moved herself into an isolated country house for 50 days.Grumbach's style is simple, plain, and direct. Her book is a study of one person's solitude; as such, it works well as a personal ""coming of age"" story. That may strike you as odd, because Grumbach is probably in her 50's or 60's, but it's a personal journey story, a tale of one person's finding herself, of imposing a solitary life upon herself.It's about solitude, and adjusting yourself from a more frenetic way of life to a simpler way of life, socially.I generally don't read this sort of thing at all, but I loved this book."
2,Sisqo disgusted me...,"The video wasn't all that good, they good of did way better than this. Mtv Diary is way better than this when they show the stars on their.Sisqo is getting way big headed to me anyway...i suggest don't buy no 24 hrs. videos...Just stick to Mtv Diary."
5,Perhaps The Best Album by Peter White,"Although this is an older album, it is probable one of the best albums by Peter White. I have several of his albums and this one is my favorite. This album is out of print, but can be purchased used. Highly recommended for the Peter White fan and anyone who enjoys jazz-guitar."
2,The Real Scoop in 5 Seconds,"Let's get real folks. This movie is not about a womens movement to accept female sexuality. Women aren't getting ""power"" by allowing 70 MEN to have sex with them one after another. This movie is about a very screwed up girl and her screwed up life and trying to make it seem like there is a point to it all. It's interesting nonetheless, but don't look for something really deep... it's just not there. No matter how sorry we may feel for her you can't force there to be a deep reason for partaking in the worlds largest gang bang."
3,IS THIS REAL...?,It's what I ordered but it doesn't smell like it normally does for some unknown reason (I buy this exact same perfume all the time).
3,"Good Selection, easy to update - needs stretch fabrics","I purchased this to make outfits for my granddaughter, since the patterns are basic and easy to adapt.Probably my only disappointment was that the tops were designed for ""stretchy fabric"" and I felt a bit uncomfortable working with them.While the styles are a bit outdated in the photos, it is easy to update them using modern fabric, however if you need more detail to update, I recommend purchasing individual patterns in more modern styles."
2,disappointing,"I was very disappointed with this book. The techniques and ideas are interesting for the beginner-intermmediate sewist. However, if you think,as I did, that this book will provide all the patterns you'll ever need, you're mistaken.The T-shirts and sweatshirts have outdated dropped shoulders and low armscyes, and there are few options for pants.You'd be better off buying individual kwik sew patterns-the styles are more current, and they provide excellent instructions."
2,out of date,"I got this book expecting it to have designs I could use. The desings in it were dreadfully out of date. There wasn't an outfit in it that I thought my kids would want to wear after I made it. I retuned the book. It DOES have serveral outfits in it, but NOT one little girls dress was in there. I was very disappointed with it."
5,Worth the added cost,I use this with a SCX-4725FN. I have purchased generic replacement cartridges in the past and they do not last nearly as long and the print quality quickly degrades. This unit performs perfectly and the print quality is excellent. It is worth the extra cost when compared to a generic replacement.
1,"Make sure its ""Samsung"" !!!","I ordered this from one of Amazon's third party seller. First, the toner was not ""Samsung"" brand as named/pictured on the website. Second, under the product name, there was a link for 'Other products by Samsung', which means the product on the current page itself should be from Samsung. It was clearly misleading the customer. The seller claims that they do not sell OEM toners somewhere else on a different page which is not obvious to navigate.About the product itself, I have not used it yet. I kept it because my current toner is about to die and I needed a spare.Update (11/11/09):The seller contacted me after reading my feedback, says they rectified the issue and offered me a full refund with free return shipping."
5,Waltz of the Scarecrows,"This is just a fun book about a girl staying with her grandparents on their farm for the summer. When her Grandpa starts dressing scarecrows in nice clothes, her curiosity is peaked. Grandma and Grandpa tell the tradition of the whole town dressing up their scarecrows.This story is really cute and reminds me of growing up with my Grandparents and the special traditions and fun things we did. The beautiful watercolor illustrations clinch it for me."
3,good sound isolation but sound quality not so great,"I bought a pair of these recently for my Shure E3's, and was quite impressed with how they block out outside sounds. However, after a few days I keep thinking there was something wrong with my hearing. My music sounded really scratchy/distored. I swicthed back to different earbud, and the clarity of the music returned. I have to agree with the one person that said sound quality suffers. IT really does. The bass is not enhanced by these ear buds, In fact I would say the opposite. I have no idea why that would be though."
2,"They fit pretty well, but sound quality suffers","Happy with the three tips included, I decided to try these for the heck of it. While they go nicely and comfortably deep into the ear and don't dare come out until you intend for them to, for some reason, they diminish the quality of the sound greatly. I can most closely describe it as the sound of overcompressed MP3s. They took nearly all of the clarity out of the music."
1,They work,These ear bud covers work very well. They may take a few times of wearing them to get used to the feeling (alittle more pressure then the soft foam)but they stay in. I run on a treadmill and it's hard to find buds that stay in the ear.
3,"Half gold, half garbage","This CD is pretty easy to describe... the first half is awesome, and the second half is complete trash. Actually, slightly more than half is good, fortunately. Tracks 1 through 7 rock, but after that, it's all pretty bad. Awake, Acid Jed, and Pizza Cutter are the best tracks on the album, and the other first 4 tracks are all really good too. Come to think of it, He's Got An Answer is listenable too. But usually I just pop the CD out after Pizza Cutter, because the last tracks are very disappointing. Still, I guess it's worth buying for the good half."
4,great job,overall this is a good cd. I am very conservative with my stars so 4/5 is quite good. Laudanum is the best song and is very calming and emotional. The rest of the songs flow very well and it is a really easy listen and has good replay value. I recommend it to Letters to Cleo fans who like the other cds. It has a similar sound to Go!.
2,Really Big and Heavy.,"Size comes too big also sleves are extremely long not to mention its missing the inside liner.Rain Hood is a Joke,its very uncomfortable on the neck (when not in use). I truly had my hopes up for this Jacket but ender up with a big Taylor bill and just decided to keep it in the closet .I bought the soft shell tactical jacket instead."
5,This was the first new album i'd bought in 18 years!!!!!,"I quit buying albums back in the early 80's, nothing came along that i thought was worth my time and money. Then i heared the 18 year old wonder on the guitar. I was hooked from then on. I ran out and bought the cd brand new. It now sits as one of 5 cds that stay in my changer at all times. Fantastic rock from cut 1 to cut 12. I recommend it for everyone's music library."
2,What in the world?,"This is by far the worst textbook I have ever used. Each chapter has tons of information, which is a good thing, dont get me wrong though. However, I found the book is written in a very unorganzied way: information are everywhere, the authors introduce a topic and lead you to nowhere. I just have a hard time to understand the main theme/focus of each chapter. This could be my own problem (i.e. being dumb and stupid,) but nothing like this ever happened to me before.By the way, I think the older version is actually better written than the current edition. The 4th edition has a clear cut between sections and better flow from one to another.Why do I have to pay almost $100 on a new book while I need to read the older version for better understanding?"
1,"Learn how to bully, be rude and intimidate sales people!","Rather than be reasonable and accept return policies, this book teaches you that if you act like a young child and have a fit, or a bully and intimidate sales clerks you can get your way! No wonder people think customer service is declining. Sales Clerks are afraid of the customers. Rather than harp on a non exsistant right to take back non defective merchandise, they should explain that when you purchase an item from a store, you have entered into a contractual agreement with them. They recieve your money, you recieve thier product. By that exchange taking place you have agreed to abide by all thier return policies. Unfortunatly, the authors of this book are less reasonable than your average shopper."
1,Learn how to whine better to get what you want?,"People should be encouraged to take responsibility for their own actions, not learn new ways to blame others. I'd love to see the authors (and anyone who buys it) try working retail for a few days, and deal with the types of customers that they themselves are. Having a temper tantrum in a store in order to get your way is no different than your four-year-old having one because you won't buy him candy. Rather than buying this book, maybe readers should think about how they're treating the store staff they deal with. These are people who work for a living, not servile peons. Terrible book!"
1,Dead Technology,"These smart-watches are now a dead issue with Microsoft abandoning the technology--maybe because they couldn't interest manufacturers in the watch. In review, the Fossil's display was very difficult to see--maybe trying to preserve battery life. I later got the Swatch version which was much better in that and several other respects."
3,Disappointing Putney and dubious character device.,"There are two categories of people who will read this book: fans of contemporary romantic suspense and fans of Mary Jo Putney. The first group will probably find this to be a perfectly enjoyable read; the second will be sorely disappointed. Ms. Putney is one of the very best historical romance writers around and as a huge fan, I wish she'd stick to that genre. ""The Burning Point"" was OK, but if certainly didn't rise to the level of her usual outstanding books.Like other reviewers, I was very uncomfortable with a reformed d wife-beater as the hero. We'd all like to believe that such men can reform, but unfortunately it's very rare. I'd hate to see this book feed the fantasies of victims of domestic violence that their abuser is really is a wonderful guy and if they are patient enough he will turn into a sensitive, caring mate."
2,I just couldn't read this....,"First of all, I must tell you that I ADORE Mary Jo Putney's work. Some of her books - The Rake, Shattered Rainbows and One Perfect Rose- are on my keepers shelf forever. But this one? Nope. I knew there was trouble when on Pg. 1 the background profession was going to be demolition. Boring. I knew there was going to be more trouble when I could put the book down and NOT want to pick it up. Those other 3 books I mentioned? Family and domestic life stopped until I finished those! But I kept telling myself that this was Mary Jo Putney and that the story was bound to improve. Well, when Donovan hit Kate across the mouth and sent her flying, I almost vomited. I knew I couldn't read this book. I know MJP tackles ""issues"" (alcoholism, etc.) and I knew this was her first foray into contemporary but it wasn't the book for me. As everyone else has said - try it - and decide for yourself. But I was very disappointed."
2,Highly Overrated,"Morbid Angel is perhaps the most overrated band in death metal. Irritating vocals and boring guitar riffs, they bring nothing to the table. Stick with your Death and Cynic records."
4,Very creative,"This is probobly the most innovative these guys have done yet. It seems that every other album is innovative, and the ones in between are more ""brutal"" or ""heavy."" This album proves both how creative Trey Azagthoth is, but also how far off track David Vincent became towards the end. Some of the lyrics are a little too ""earthy"" for me, as I prefer the more bizarre lyrics. Erik Rutan also does quite a fine job on here, completely obliterating all his work with Ripping Corpse. I wish I could give this album a 4 and 3/4 stars, because even though I like it a lot, I don't think its quite as good as ""Blessed..."""
5,Solid swing.,"Bobby Caldwell can do no wrong. In his long career, I don't know of a single clunker he's ever recorded. But he has grown through his albums, this being no exeption. The songs on this album begin to imbue the smooth jazz with some more classic jazz elements, and he's beginning to explore more emotionally vulnerable aspects of his voice. This album came before Caldwell started doing the classics from the Sinatra era, which he is an ACE at. But this album satisfies me on every level. The guy also writes most of his songs, as well as plays most of the musical instruments on his albums. But he's equally great live in concert. He is solid gold, the real thing: a fabulous musician."
4,Not really Progrock more jazzy,"I've known about this album for years, but had never heard anything from it. I was a huge fan of ""In the Court of the Crimson King"", and Mr McDonald and Mr Giles had both had a significant role in that. I usually don't pay a lot of attention to the drums, but there is something almost melodic about Michael Giles' drumming. Ian McDonald is an extraordinary multi-instrumentalist whose handiwork is all over ITCOTCK. This album has a very melodic tone, not really ""progrock"" but more jazzy, I thought of Mark-Almond, rather than Yes or ELP. I'm very pleased."
3,FLIGHT OF THE IBIS is the only fabbalicious track,"Wayne Klein said: ""The best songs on M&G; are actually superior to many of the leftover and rewritten tracks on IN THE WAKE OF POSEIDON.""I can vouch for that. FLIGHT OF THE IBIS (by M&G;) is an earlier version of CADENCE AND CASCADE (by King Crimson). But the 2 tunes are very dissimilar and IBIS is far better."
5,A Rediscovered Treasure,"I was looking through my vinyl collection for discs to move-on to friends. Lo & behold I came across this fine recording.In the early 1980's, I purchased this record a second time because the first was damaged and the new one was a pristine Japanese pressing.This is such a melodic disc with excellent harmonies and musicianship. It is a pleasure to hear again.I think the mix is very good though the drums sound dry. It has a sweeping soundstage considering how few players deliver an abundance of sound.Enjoy this one, a forgotten moment from 1971."
2,Very Rudimetary,"Not really worth the money. This doesn't tell you anything you couldn't figure out by just playing around with the unit for 10 or 15 minutes, less time then it takes to watch the video. I was hoping the video would give me more advanced information on what I can do with the unit. Not so much."
4,Healthy,Very interesting and healthy product Checking out recipes for it. :-Dcan be used in many reciepes. Check it out.
3,"RCA RP3720 Clock Radio with Extra-Large 1.4"" Blue Display, Auto Time set and Dual Wake","The primary reason for getting this clock radio is the larger number display. This is great. The controls are somewhat intuitive.BIG PROBLEM: the display makes a humming noise that keep you AWAKE! The brighter the display, the noisier the HUMMMM. It is somewhat quieter at night in the dark, but the HUMMMM is realy BAD!!!How do I fix it or can I trade it in on another unit?Help!"
3,Would love this clock except for its brightness,"I've had this clock for about a year, and it would be a perfect clock for me except that it is entirely too bright. The ease of setting the time and alarm, ease of snoozing and shutting off the alarm, the quality of the radio, even the pretty blue color and clean, streamlined shape are great. Yet even on the light-sensitive setting, which dims the display when the lights go out in the room, the clock casts a light nearly as bright as the night light we have in another room in the house. I've tried all sorts of things to tone it down -- even taped blue electrical tape over the figures and eventually resorted to completely covering it with a cloth overnight, which then rendered it impossible to see what time it is in the middle of the night. Finally, I've decided I just need to get a new clock. Very disappointing."
3,Not as good as I expected,"There are some tunes that Chicago puts their style on in Night and Day that are different and good. But for the most part, I will stick to their tunes when I want to listen to them."
5,"Good job, Chicago!",Definite nod to the big band era with the Chicaago touch. The horn section is top notch. This is a nice change when you want to listen to something other than rock and roll.
2,Disappointment,"I like Chicago with their great horn section. I love Big Band music, especially some of the classics on this album. One would expect this album to be a match made in heaven.Unfortunately, very much like the peanut butter-flavored Jelly Belly, this album leaves a bad taste in your mouth despite how good the separate ingredients are. Although some of the tracks have a good sound, others (especially the painfully disappointing ""In The Mood"") just fall apart. I'm not a musical purist, and I can accept interpretations. However, I can't recommend this album."
2,Where is the clip?,"When I ordered this stand, I assumed there was a way to attach my mic to it but now I have to pay 7 more dollars to get a mic clip for it. Only one of these reviews mention there is no mic clip and the product description does not specifically say there is no clip. So if you buy this, make sure you are aware you can't attach the mic to the stand unless you get a clip separately. It doesn't make sense why they don't include a clip."
4,tripod mic stand 7701B,I play in a three piece acoustic band and have used much more expensive mic stands in the past and have found them to perform no better than this stand. I like how effortlessly you can loosen or tighten the boom on this stand. The stand is a bit light but if you pay attention to how you set it up you should have no problem using it. I bought one and based on how well it worked purchased two more.Roger
5,Cool,"I'm using this for in house practice / jamming.. probably not a lot of playing out, so abuse will be minimal. It's very sturdy, good construction, and quite adjustable. We'll worth the price I paid."
2,Cheap stand - it will do,"You get what you pay for. Mine has to support a Yeti Blue in its shock mount, plus pop shield plus the CAD baffle, which is the heaviest part. Too much weight for this stand. I ended up removing the boom arm (angling left in the photo) and just attaching everything from the upright base pole. More stable that way and less likely to fall over."
4,"Good for home or studio use, not sure if I'd take it on the road","Title says it all. Good quality for home or studio use, but not sure how it would survive if it were to be taken on tour. Still for the price you get a nice adjustable stand that can be manipulated to get basically any mic position you'd want, from overhead for drums to fret level for guitars, above or below vocalists depending on the tone you're hunting, etc. Versatile and great to work with."
2,Inconsistent Quality,"I ordered one of these as a test before ordering an additional four for a recording studio. The first one that arrived is great. It functions really well and is exactly what I needed. However, the additional four that I ordered (which were not all black but rather had silver parts) are borderline pathetic. One of them has already become non-adjustable, and I wonder how long it will be until the others do the same. They are obviously from a different manufacturer and are a real disappointment. Consider yourself lucky if you get the all-black model. If you get the model with the silver hardware, you may be sorely disappointed."
4,Decent,"I've had this stand about a year now, and it has held up pretty well as a self-booming rig. One thing to note, this is designed for lightweight mics. I paired it with the MXL 990, and the result was VERY unstable. The solution to this is to add weight to the base. I use 7.5 pounds of small barbell weights (a five and a 2.5), and that seems to do the job. The clips are a joke, but that's what electrical tape is for."
2,Nice stand UNLESS used with BlueMic Yeti,"Actually, not a bad stand at all, seems fairly rugged, but you never want to ""man handle"" a nice or needed mic stand.Does not come with any reasonable mic adapter, and therein lies the rub. No matter what you do or devise, it is ""impossible"" to successfully use this particular model stand with the BlueMic Yeti / Yeti Pro mics...the ones that connect an otherwise superb USB-to-computer mic to your computer.That's a shame, as that major problem is reflected with another user review as well. BlueMic Yeti users need to look elsewhere, as ""renovating"" this mic stand would take too long."
4,mic stand for samson co1u,"good stand for the price. i have a samson co1u, it fits perfectly with the product. i'm satisfied. i liked that everything about the stand is adjustable. shipping was very prompt"
3,Mic stand,This Mic stand is just OK. Is for those that they need a mic stand and they would NOT use it to much for adjustments. If you do use your mic stand for frequent adjustments looks elsewhere.
5,ROCK OUT,Good quality. Do not forget to order a mic clamp or holder though like I did. They use it at my house for the Wii so it is getting the same abuse as a touring band would give it and is holding up fine.
2,NOT A GREAT BUY FOR THE ROAD!!,"I BOUGHT THIS BOOM STAND IN OCTOBER OF LAST YEAR, FROM AMAZON. RIGHT OUT OF THE BOX, IT SEEMED THINNER AND WEAKER THEN MY PROLINE BOOM STAND. WITHIN LESS THAN A MONTH OR TWO, THE THREADS STARTED STRIPPING. I THOUGHT IT WAS JUST LOOSE, BUT FOUND THE THE TOP PART JUST KEPT TURNING AND NEVER TIGHTENED. THE TIGHTENING LEVER FELL APART TOO, AND THE PLASTIC END KEPT FALLING OFF. OVERALL, I WOULD PUT A BIT MORE MONEY DOWN AND GET THE PROLINE INSTEAD. http://www.amazon.com/ProLine-MS220-Tripod-Microphone-Stand/dp/B001JHZYL8/ref=sr_1_2?ie=UTF8&qid=1346269571&sr=8-2&keywords=proline+boom+stand"
4,Good stand,"This stand is good. My only concern is the weigh balance when the boom arm parallel to the floor. I have an AT2020 mic with a shock mount, and when the book is extended toward me while I'm sitting the weight balance wants to lean it forward.The obvious solution is to pull the arm back for better weight balance. But that pushes the mic further away from me than I'd like."
3,Too cheap.,"This could be used for lightweight microphones but don't bother wasting your money if you're using a studio microphone. The base has a small circumference, so you can't stick the boom out very far at all, almost useless. There are better deals for just slightly more money. Or if you really want near studio quality, try the Samson studio boom mic stands."
4,Great Mic Stand.,"I use this for my home recording studio. This stand is versatile enough to be used at almost any angle. From playing and singing piano, recording guitar and vocals, and other various positions. Sometimes hard to keep the mic firmly in place but that may be a function of my shock mount.Cheap and highly recommended."
4,Needs microphone clip to hold microphone,We expected a clip to hold the microphone as part of the product. We found out Christmas morning that we needed to buy a separate part to have a stand that will hold a microphone.
2,Poor manufacturing quality,"This stand is barely passable. The main problem I have is that the part that holds the boom did not thread cleanly onto the stand. After fiddling with it a while, I managed to force the parts together, but to get a reasonably secure fit, I had to use a couple of pairs of pliers. The result is that it can't be disassembled and the paint is scratched off the upright part of the stand.On the positive side, it wasn't very expensive, but in the future I'll steer clear of the On Stage brand."
3,Fine... for practice...,I ordered this for my blue yeti mic but it isn't tall enough and when I attach my mic onto this stand it keeps singing down.... if not... gradually... I use this for practice when I am singing and playing an instrument which helps a bit... not bad....
3,Useful knowledge,Each chapter can be read any time you need more information or you can read the whole book to gain a detail review of the different types of retirement plans. This is one of the things I like best about NOLO books; you don't need to read them cover to cover to gain useful knowledge. I got this book from LibraryThing as part of their book give away.
4,Practical advise on how to avoid legal pitfalls while getting your money,"This book tackles simplifying mainly tax codes and laws pertaining as applied to removing the money saved in tax deferred retirement insturments. A mind numbing subject made less so and less fraught with risk of making a mistake or misunderstanding.This is not a book about how to invest your 401K or IRA for maximum return. It is about getting your hands on your money while giving away the least to the IRS, etc."
4,I am normally a fan of Nolo Press but wanted more with this title,"Nolo press does a good at presenting information in an easy an understandable format, which can be said this title also.Yes the book gives you good advice on what you need to be aware of when it comes to retiring and withdrawing money for your retirement plans. No I am not retiring anytime soon but my parents are.The book covers tax strategies, penalties and fees associated with withdrawl, and the various distribution.I do recommend at getting a tustworthy financial advisor that can help make the right decisions when it comes withdrawing money. The book will give the knowledge when having discussions with your financial advisor.Recommend Purchase: YesOverall value on a scale 1 to 10: 8"
2,"Blondie Book? Great,, but what happined??","Just got a copy of the NEW Blondie book,, As a huge Blondie fan I'm glad I own it, but for anyone who knows little about Blondie, be prepared to be totally confuse. The book makes way too many references to so many people(in the punk & music scene) that the average person could careless. There needed to be more pictures, and less essays. I found many of the essays just plain boring. And there weren't any COLOR pictures!! The vintage Blondie photo were great,, but the newer pictures of Blondie and Deborah Harry were unfocused and not very good. Why make the ""newest"" Blondie book not palatable for hard core Blondie fans, and totally CONFUSING for the general public.Simplier is better and this complex series of article and essays reminds me more of a college text book.The idea of the Blondie book was great,, but what happined??"
5,"Blondie,From Punk to Present",If you are a Blondie fan or just someone who wants to know all about the band that started it all this is the book for you.Excellent!...
4,Sweet story,"This story has a reincarnation theme, but is nicely written, with a lovely story and great characters. For the price, a good read..."
4,You gotta love him!,"Even those of us who decry the tabloid twist of network news have got to love the brash, brassy, bold and bullish auto-biography of this true pioneer of the news and talk TV era. ""Geraldo"" is quite ""up front' about his flaws. His book is worth seeking out."
1,Terrible Taste,"I picked this up at my local grocery store thinking it would be good, name brand and all. It tasted terrible. You have to add a lot of the seasoning just to taste anything, then when you finally taste it, it has a powdery fake taste to it. I was extremely disappointed."
1,Prefer other brands,The white cheese flavor isnt quite right. Used to get the big comtainer of the stuff they use at carnivals. Has a more crisp cheddar flavor than this. Been giving them away to friends..
5,I wouldn't miss this book if I were you.,"The Sharp End is an absolute classic. It had believablecharacters, a fast paced and well thought out story, and it's areflection of the Slammers at its height. Heroes are -men-,and not a conglomeration of ideals.If you want military action, adventure, and an attention todetail that could only come from someone who's been there,then don't miss out. Expect everything you've come to knowabout David Drake to come out at its best."
5,Sierras Homecoming,"I love all the McKettrick Series stories, they are all different, but many of the same characters throughout. I really enjoy these type of books because it's almost like a continuation of the same story that I liked in the first place!"
3,too complicated,"I have had a lot of trouble with this product, its a little too complicated to do some basic things."
4,Ashkenazy's second cycle of Beethoven Piano Conertos,It's a good version but a little bit slow. I like more Ashkenazy's first cycle with Solti.
4,Good reference on VC money and confidential information,"Based on the interviews with CEOs, it takes a conservative tone in explaining the inner workings of startups. The most common theme echoed throughout: make damn sure you leave your employer cleanly and do NOT take anything that isn't yours. Great analysis of venture capital and the CEO's role of finding the next round of funding.This book complements ""Engineering Your Startup: A Guide for the High Tech Entrepreneur,"" by Michael L. Baird, which does a better job outlining suggestions on writing the business plan."
5,timeless,it was sung with a spiritual projection of christmass spirit that couldn't have put me into christmass more even if he sung it in English I would recommend this to anyone getting into the christmass spirit. As long as the language barrier wouldn't be a problem
3,Multiple versions of CD are NOT the same,"Be careful. There are multiple CDs with the same title (""Weihnachten Mit Heintje"") and they are not all the same. If you like the younger Heintje (a young boy voice like the Vienna Boys Choir sound) then not all of these versions will be correct. I have reported the confusion of the multiple versions to Amazon but it has not been corrected yet. I tried to order a copy from MediaPearl (who said they ship from NJ USA) and, when I wrote to them along with my order, their response was that they ship 6,000 items per day and couldn't/wouldn't check the version for me. Of course then the copy I received was the wrong version and they had shipped it from Germany, not New Jersey, so I'm not going to bother to pay to ship it back. I'll just never do business with them again."
4,Adorable!,"We have had the hardest time trying to find a toy radio for my 14 month old son. I had one when i was little that was made by fisher price. Apparently nobody feels that radios are good toys for little ones. We couldn't even find any for older kids. I found 20 digital cameras for kids, but no radios.However, i came across this little gem, and i was so excited becase it looked perfect. It is much smaller than i thought it would be, but it fits perfectly in my son's hand. He can push the buttons and carry it around with him and dance to his little heart's content. He's been pleased with it.We only made one modification. I did remove the antenna, because i was afraid he would try to put it in his mouth, or it would poke him. It was very easily removed, and still got good reception without the antenna."
3,Detailed yet empty?!,"Book goes over all the models w/ 1 page per model type. Thin book w/ small pages (4-5"" tall). The problem is that the author gives a VERY brief account of the car & then moves on. Not enough room on the page probably (or not enough research done). Sometimes even mixing in 2-3 models/trims per page. Also noticed some info was missing, ie 0-62 in ... nothing then puts the weight or gas mileage.Great book as far as reviving memories of the Renault Family, some interesting figures but definitly not a History book on the brand.Tips to author (if interested): Keep the style (1 page per model), make bigger pages with more info, facts.. even anecdotes & tales (trims, interior, options, tires, race victories & competitors). All color pictures please & more than just 1 pic per car."
5,monty python blows up,"Another Monty Python hilarious toy, Mini Holy Grenade PLUSH. What else isthere to say. PLUSH says it all."
4,holy handgrenade is hilarious,Must be a Python fan to enjoy this funny toy from a funny bit from the Holy Grail.
4,Another good one from Dan & Tim,"Anybody who appreciates the wonderful combination both Fogelburg and Weisberg would love this CD. This seem to pick up where ""Twin Sons"" left off. The music is put together nicely and makes good for easy listening. One drawback would be how similar all the songs are to each other, but each one is well played. Anyone who enjoys Dan Fogelburg or Tim Weisberg would like this one. Both Dan and Tim proved that they can still work their magic."
3,Another consumer burned by this company,"I bought the 26"" HVE version of this TV. I like the TV just fine but, like some other reviewers, I'm still waiting for my $200 rebate after 7 months! I've sent emails and left voicemails but I'm ignored. I will not buy another product from this company."
5,Great,I have been running them for over a year and no problems. Quick install and everything was in the box and the correct size.
5,Blakes Bar & Grill,"This was definately one of a kind edition. Blake, once again, has out done himself. He's awesome!!!"
5,OUT OF THIS WORLD BLAKE SHELTON,I have bought 2 copies of Blake Shelton's Barn & Grill one forthe house and one for the car..it's really a feel good cd andBlake makes you feel good just listening to him..My favorite songs on this cd is Some Beach followed by Goodbye Time andGood old boy-bad old boyfriend..these are just my personal favsbut there is nothing on the cd that won't make you keep listeningI give it 5 stars and even bought the video collection..If youhaven't seen Blake in concert do so as soon as possible you won'tregret it and you'll have a great time..MAKE YOURSELF HAPPY ANDGO BUY A COPY OF BLAKE SHELTON'S BARN & GRILL NOW.
4,So-so..,"Being a male, I thought it was very interesting reading this story. As I read before, the exciting part did not happen until very far out into the story, and just as it started to pick up, the ended. I wished there was more and it would go a little farther before the end.It's pretty much about a girl who falls in love with her substitute teacher. Soon, the teacher starts to touch her in places and kiss her. She doesn't realize it, and neither did I, but he ended up being a ""bad guy,"" rather than the ""nice guy,"" he was pictured to be throughout the first 100 pages.Overall.. if you have spare time, pick it up. I don't think little kids or adults will enjoy it. It gets really boring and you can't tell the plot out until it ends."
3,hMmMm...,"I think the book was pretty interesting...it was about one of the only books that i didn't want to put down..it really caught my attention..because i mean stuff like this does happen often, when people try to stalk you and say stuff that you aren't...the only thing i didn't really like about the book is that it is not a good book for younger kids...i wouldn't recommend anyone reading it unless they were at least 13."
5,Unique and appealing,"No bibliophile will want to resist this instructive, entertaining and amusing anthology, which reveals indexes as whimsical (Lewis Carroll), enticing (Pepys), hilarious (Julian Barnes), or playful (Virginia Woolf). Indexers portrayed in fiction are noted to be everything from drunk (in Trollope) to meticulous (Sherlock Holmes) to romantic (in Barbara Pym). The entries are fascinating, the brief history of indexing is engrossing, and A.S.Byatt's foreword is brilliant. A splendid and unique 'must-have' for any book lover."
5,love it,i love this cd. i wish that he would come out with some more new songs because he is such a good singer and this cd just made my collection complete
3,Nothing really special,"The second single off the hit platinum-selling album, ""Burn"", is a smoother, more R&B based track than its predecessor ""Yeah"". The song itself is very similar to Mario Winans' hit ""I Don't Wanna Know"", but I feel this is the weaker one of the two. This track has very little variation in it, making it just a bit boring to listen to in my opinion, but Usher's vocals are good as always, and if you're a fan of Usher, you would definitely like this song."
4,Good simple watch with a little elegance,"Recently purchased this watch to have a quality automatic watch (Swiss made) that was unique and not a household word like Rolex, Tag Huer, Omega. This watch has a unique date pointer which is nice to look at but not intrusive to sight. The hands and number indices glow in the dark quite nicely for a few hours. The crown is large which makes winding much easier while wearing it. This is a good watch to wear that is still classy without looking like ""bling."" The only down point is that the crystal is made of plexiglass (plastic) which means it can scatch easily, but can be replaced cheaply as well. Why Oris is using a plexiglass cyrstal is a mystery.Overall I'm pleased with the watch as it looks simple but has a touch of style with its bezeled edges."
5,Don't let the truth scare you!,"In my opinion (Unfounded Loyality)has shed a vail of misinformation that has been historically passed on from generation to generation by African-Americans. This book uncovered the distastfully truth about the Democratic party, and their role in the enslavement of African Americans. This book opened my eyes, and enpowered me to make informed decisions about my vote and who I'm voting for.As Black male I have always voted on the Democratic ticket, but after reading Mr. Perryman's book that decision maybe harder to make the next time around. Well done Mr.Perryman. I know from experience that it is often difficult to take on a subject that is not popular. However, this book isn't about being popular, it's about setting the record straight.I would recommend this book to anyone who has an interest in the truth."
2,"the hardcore version of George Orwell's ""1984""","This is my first snapcase album. I thought it would be a deftones like band but they sound more fundamental and dry. Which isn't a bad thing. ""Cogulate"" is a great song that is the most exciting song on the album. The whole ablum goes through songs of rebellion, big brother, and the right for independt thought. For a band labeled into the hardcore genre that album felt very soft. most of the songs are long and don't stick to you. Sorry, you should burn it or steal it from the blind guy at the record store."
5,Very worthwhile!,Great reading! Readers learn tradition and history while hearing very intriguing stories which make children (and adults) think. Wonderful way to instill values in children. We need more books like this. Reflecting on what you do and the consequences (positive and negative) are very important to know as you grow up. Looking forward to more stories!
3,UNFULFILLED,Boy did this one leave me hanging and wondering...what the heck? It started off in a great way...continued to the middle without putting it down...mind racing to read the ending - then when I finished I just closed the book and thought...what? Don't bother with this unless you like all your questions unanswered and no periods at the ends of sentences.
1,A Good Reason Why Book Burning Should Return,"Should be entitled, ""Way Too Many Pages About Why I love myself."" Rosenhaus is an egomaniac who revels in his self-absorption. This book has no redeeming value, except as a substitute for Syrup of Ipicac. While Rosenhaus gloats about the athletes he has somehow convinced to hire him, he makes no mention of the careers he has ruined, such as that of Errict Rhett, a top NFL running back who Rosenhaus advised sit out an NFL season rather than honor the binding contract Rhett had with an NFL team. As a result, Rhett lost a year of pay, was demoted to second team the following year when he returned, was traded to another team, where he is presently collecting splinters in his rear. This type of ignorant greed is nowhere to be found in this worthless, self-lovefest of a book."
1,Don't waste your Money,The lights have no pattern to them. my son got frustrated that he couldn't control the light color. very cheaply made.
4,great for any hip hop collection,I was attrected to the album when I saw the video on MTV back in 1996 and had to have the album..I have lost/damaged/had stolen 3 copies of this album but never hesitate to buy another copy...fu&%ed up voice or not..the man can rap
4,Do it yourself cord replacement,"I needed replacement elastic cords for my Lafuma recliner and didn't want to pay the $22. I found the 3/16"" black bungee cord online at DSW Rope and Cordage and bought 15' for $3 + 3.49 shipping. It worked great. I had to measure the pieces myself (against the old ones) and wrap some black tape on the ends so they wouldn't ravel but it saved a lot of cash."
3,Works OK but only for single strand webbing,"Bought this to replace deteriorated lacing on chairs purchased from Sports Authority. Our chairs are double laced, which gives better support than the single lace. This product works, but must be strung tightly to come close to the stock lacing, or a person could buy two kits per chair - which is spendy."
4,good book,"I like this book. It is hard to find books on how to make swimsuits and leotards, but this one has lots of great information, and the instructions are pretty easy to follow. It comes with some good patterns too."
3,Not as powerful as her other books,"Praying God's Will For Your Life by Stormie Omartian was a bit of a disappointment to me. I have all of her other books, and I refer to them often for prayer. I can point to several times that those prayers brought about very specific circumstances in my life. This book just fell flat for me. Maybe I just read it at the wrong time in my life, so it didn't speak to me. The stories about how prayers got her through crises in her life seemed stale, and the prayers were short and uninspiring. I didn't feel uplifted or have my faith renewed nor did I find God's will for my life by reading this book. I highly recommend The Power of a Praying Parent and The Power of Praying Together, but this one, I would skip."
5,One of my favorites.....,"Back when paper zines were cool.....An eclectic, entertaining, interesting and thought provoking collection of people, organisations and ideas expressed as only a combination of Boing-Boing (the original 'zine) and Wired could.Sex, drugs and cyberspace as seen in 1995"
1,A Bad Game,"This game is bad because it's hard to control the character and you never get to the end. After a hour of surching you find the monsters and can't beat them. After a while, you die. I don't recamend this game to anyone. I've had this game for a year and only played it three times."
3,Central Heating issue,"The book did a nice job of generally explaining how heat pump work. I thought my heat pump was not working properly because it periodically blew cold air while in heating mode. The book said ""under extreme conditions"" it reverses heat/cold direction to defrost the thermocouple. I don't consider 60 degrees to be ""extreme conditions."" After talking with a heating repair man, I learned that heat pumps are supposed to reverse direction at any given temperature for less than 5 minutes at a time to defrost the thermocouple. The book should have said that!Also, there are no photographs, only color drawings."
3,I wish I would have started with this book...,"Such a silly fun book. I mentioned in another review that I really get upset when I find a good book, read it, enjoy it, finish it, and then find out it was book number 2 or 3 in a series or trilogy.This is what happened with this one. After starting with a more recent book in the series this book seemed very elementary and silly. I did enjoy it, don't get me wrong but it just didn't seem to have the same POP as the other books in the series.It is a fun silly story, a quick read, mindless chatter but I admit I think we all need a little bit of that every once in a while."
1,Extemely repetitive,"The book is too repetitive. There is some interesting history here, but I didn't find it very relative to solving my sleep problem. Author presents his opinions repeatedly as to what is natural human sleep. But the real problem was that the book made me reflect on my sleep problem to the point where I couldn't get to sleep anymore. After a few months, I stopped thinking about the whole matter and was able to get to sleep again. That's not a criticism of the book, but more a warning. Really, I don't recommend this book -- too repetitive."
2,Ultimate Irony,"It's freezing outside, two homeless men have one possession between them, a heater. The unfortunate thing is, they have no place to plug that heater in.The two men Ben (Gary Farmer from Powwow Highway) and The Man (Steve Quimette) find a receipt in the heater's package and they're going to take a trip to a suburban mall to get a refund. That'll mean much needed money for both. They travel via the way of the poor, on foot, and they meet a series of truly interesting people from a nurse, a landlady, and several others.Some help, some do not. ""The Heater"" is an interesting and ironic take on homelessness in Canada. I confess, I got the film for Gary Farmer, whose superb performance in ""Powwow Highway"" made me an instant fan. I'd like to say I loved ""The Heater"" or I got some great useful truth from it. The hard truth is it's heartbreaking and neither of the aforementioned happened.Rebecca Kyle, July 2008"
1,"""Sorry"" to all reviewers who purchased the DVD; but ""Thanks"" for the heads up","I am truly sorry to those who purchased the DVD. I read ALL the reviews and some critical scenes seems to be left out. I would have been totally pissed because I know this movie like that back of my hand. Obviously for those who never saw the movie/VHS, they got to enjoy the movie as is, but for those who had the opportunity to see this GREAT movie uncut, I feel the anger and frustration via your words.I will not get this DVD, because I believe you all when you say they screwed up this DVD.Maybe we should tell Oprah about this? Flood her with emails about how they chopped up HER film. With Oprah...you never know!"
3,"Same here.. well, kinda.","I actually bought this movie from a popular retail store about a year ago, and that version was missing some key points as well. So when I saw the DVD here on Amazon, I was almost tempted to purchase it again in hopes that it would have been the complete version. However, after reading the comments, I see differently.Aside from the cuts and edits, I love this movie, its characters, and actors."
5,The best move I've ever seen that focuses on women,"OMG! Finally, a movie that portrays the many roles of black women and the various issues that affect them all. I saw the movie on Lifetime and I couldn't take my eyes off of it. Just amazing. Nothing like that let down ""Kingdom Come"" that had all those good black actors/actresses and portrayed a negative image of black families. This movies shows the good, the bad, and the ugly of being a black woman and how we overcome our struggles. Buy this movie and be inspired."
1,The VHS version has deleted scenes as well,"I am so disappointed with both versions of this film VHS and DVD. The key elements are missing, and I like everyone else who brought the movie can not understand it. I grew up watching this film, and I personally think it is the best film about Black Women. I wish that this film would be released in the original format, and not this poor demostration of what the message clearly should be to a general audience. I think everyone who truly loves this film as much as I do, should continue to complain until the film is released on both VHS and DVD in the original format along with any extra bonus features including the director's commentary (if available). If people are still considering purchasing this film, I would suggest to do background research on the film, and to read all reviews so there will be no disappointment like so many of us previously were when the film was released. Good Luck To All."
3,Needs a seperate power adapter - wished they showed this in the pic,"I have an older laptop and needed USB 2.0 on it. This card works, but I don't appreciate that I have to plug in a separate AC adapter for it to power my usb 2.0 external drive. What you can't see in the picture is the round ac jack between the USB ports. It does work, just annoying."
3,TRENDnet: not so good with power supply,"The TRENDnet works fine w/o using the power supply. When using the power supply however, and with the supply pin inserted, one cannot use the bottom row of UBS ports because there in not enough space to fit in the UBS connectors. The top row is ok."
3,Ver y good,"I purchased this when it was released and just now am submitting a review. ""Beautiful World"" didn't light a fire under my tail when it was released but as time has past it has made its mark as a very good effort. ""Resignation Superman"" grows stronger with each listen as does the title track and ""Crazy Mary"" but then again I could list every song here. This effort may not be a good as previous BHTM efforts but don't letthat discourage you. BHTM are mellow and profound. Todd's guitar is smooth and easy as is his lyrics which are wise beyond his years. A true ""craft"" band, honing their style and crafting their art, they never fail to deliver quality in the studio and on stage."
3,Imagine Yourself,"listening to an alternative radio show with some pretty good tunes. That is what Beautiful World sounds like. Everysong could be from a different artist. From Pink Floyd, Dire Straits, Puddle of Mud, The BoDeans, Point Black, The Black Sorrows, J.L.Hooker, etc... sound alikes. Interesting and cohesive but without a constant factor, which is just fine. Everyonce in awhile is just fine to loose yourself in some pretty good tunes whitout a lavel. Okey...."
3,Disappointed,"While I enjoy the songs from Michael, I was looking for the actual score from the movie. There is some very beautiful music missing from this CD. Won't be playing it as much as I might have. I'm somewhat disappointed."
1,Wouldn't recommend...,I bought this for my husband as a Christmas gift. He's an avid cook and has used these tongs many times since Christmas. The silicone part of the tongs acutally started to rip off about a week ago so we had to throw them away. They look nice and I liked the closure mechanism (hence the one star) but they didn't last long at all. Do yourself a favor and buy another product!
3,"Remember, it's SDTV, not HD","This is a rare find; something that converts composite video (NOT ""component"") into a sharp VGA picture. The box can accept one VGA signal (like a PC or laptop) to pass through, then switch that same monitor among four composite video inputs (single, yellow, RCA-type connector with or without the additional red/white stereo). The result is surprisingly sharp, but nowhere near HDTV quality. Still, it's nice to be able to take your old NES, Atari or Genesis and hook it up to a VGA monitor. It is a powered adapter, so be prepared to find space for a new outlet brick."
3,"Well, it works","Clearly there are far too many differences between VGA and component video sources. While it DID work, everything had this slight blur to it. Not enough to make anything IMPOSSIBLE to do, but it's visible enough be annoying- even with 16 bit gamsingHsing the bypass to run your VGA source even gives the display a ghost shaddow.Even so, it was cheaper than all the other boxes that I'm sure give similar results, and it's good enough to play my vintage games. I'll just have to run my computer direct to VGA instead of through the box to get a crisp picture."
3,Adequate for attaching a Wii to an lcd monitor,"I bought this so I could use my Wii with an Acer monitor I have. The image is ok, but if you need a 42"" HD image experience, you'll probably be disappointed. On the other hand, it works well enough. I haven't experienced any momentary black outs, as some others have reported. The game play is fine.The audio channel is noisy through head phones, so you should plan on running the audio directly from the Wii into a stereo or what have you.if you order from Canada, the shipping is horrendously expensive, effectively doubling the price. But it is still cheaper than buying a new TV (I don't watch television, I just want to play games, once in a while).Buy it if you have a monitor and don't want to spend the money on a new TV to use with your Wii."
3,"OK, but not as good as I hoped","When I connect my console, it works just fine, but when I switch back to my computer, it doesn't handle my resolution properly and I get a double image. My wife was getting a headache trying to use it before I bypassed it. Now when I want to use it, I need to move the monitor plug (or get a KVM or other monitor switch.)"
1,"DON""T WASTE YOUR MONEY!","Went out withen 6 months. Plus the annoying, always on blue light will drive you insane."
3,video,unit works well had similar unit but was no longer available from mfgit's able to be used in web cam operations due to avi capability versusmost units that utilize mpg formats
1,Won't install on Vista 64-bit even though box says it works on Vista,"Product does not install on Vista 64-bit at all. Purchased this device to capture, back up and edit old home videos. Also tried Diamond vc600 with equally disappointing results. Ended up with Roxio 2010 Special Edition which has the capture device and editing software. Worked right out of the box for a similar price."
1,Beware....These are not good,"I don't know how anyone can rate these cookies at 4 or 5 Stars. These cookies are terrible. Not only do they taste horrible, they taste stale."
1,"Boring, confusing","I got this book from the library, am halfway through it, and I give up. I came over here to see what others thought, if maybe I was missing something, but it appears I'm not alone.Usually I'll force myself to finish a book to give the author a chance. Not this one. I feel no connection to the characters and I'm having trouble keeping track of who's who. We start out with a murder and a missing person, and halfway through the book it appears nothing has been done to solve the initial case; instead we're investigating empty warehouses and castles with a side trip to Thailand and a kidnapping in between.I'm finding myself reading pages over again to see if I missed something but sure can't find what it was..."
1,One of the worst I've ever read,"I'm someone who is generally an easy-going reader. I've liked a lot of books that many reviewers on Amazon hated. However, I loathed Biowar. I hated the characters, the plot, the dialogue. There was nothing in this book that I cared about. I could care less if the characters lived or died - no, I wanted them to die just so that the stupid book would end!This is absolutely the worst book I've ever read. As a long-time Steven Coonts fan, I can't believe he would put his name on this. I hope this is the last of the Deep Black series."
4,A cut above the rest,"Yes, it's a cheesy title. They are good diagonal cutters that do the job well. I haven't had them very long so I can't speak to their durability but I am satisfied with them thus far."
5,"#1, The Greatest!","Air Supply has always and will always be the best. All of their albums are gold. Russell has such a strong and beautiful voice that will just take your breath away. I have seen them in concert every year, and I can't wait until they come back. I know their next album will be as great as every other. I'm looking forward to their new album, which I understand will be coming out sometime in 2003. Keep on rock'n air Supply! You guys are great! Susanne Curro at eiscu2000@att.net."
2,Flat performance from the voice of Russell Hitchcock.....,"My wife and I have seen Air Supply in concert three times in the last five years. We never get anough of these guys! And we have three different ""live"" albums on CD, but this one is lacking. Yes, they perform a few songs in this live performance that are not on the other two (namely ""Someone"", ""Always"", ""Unchained Melody"", and ""Goodbye"") which is appreciated and adds some variety. But Russell's singing on this album is often strained and flat. It sounds like he was virtually gasping for air at times! Yes, every performer can have an ""off"" night, but this set would have vastly improved if better takes had been chosen from Air Supply's live performances than the selections here. Love the songs, but the performance here for the most part was not up to snuff for Air Supply. Worthy of 2 1/2 stars."
2,NO MORE JO B. FOR ME,"I discovered Jo Beverley in IN PRAISE OF YOUNGER MEN and enjoyed Demon's story, so I looked for the two sequels. I am plagued by the thought that each of these stories should have been like the first...120 pages. Then maybe all three could have been put into one book that would have been enjoyable. The Susan character was, in a word, awful. Don't know if it was truly because she was so unlikeable or because Beverley's writing was so see-saw: ""I shouldn't sleep him, but, no, I'm going to anyway""; ""I should tell him the truth, but, no, I'm going to lie (again)""; ""I need to leave Crag Wyvern immediately, but, no, I'll hang around for another day or two"". Honestly, how can you like someone like this for 360 pages? It just had the feel of a well-plotted short story that had been s-t-r-e-t-c-e-d o-u-t unmercifully."
3,Ok,not as good as I would like. Dosn't taste like store bought. Wish you could get plain powdered cheese without other flavorings.
5,Great Value!!,I was so glad to have found this product on Amazon!! Walmart quit carrying this flavor and I was not sure how I was going to get it!! Thanks for the great product and the great savings!!
4,"Very good seasoning, despite too much salt.","Kernel Season's Parmesan and Garlic seasoning is very tasty and an excellent value, although a bit on the salty side. They could cut the salt content in half and it would be even better, allowing more of the garlic and cheese flavor to come through. That aside, it adds a nice touch to popcorn."
2,Tastes and smells like vinegar,"I am not sure why this is called Parmesan and garlic, because all I could taste was vinegar and yuck.Don't get this. Yuck Yuck"
5,I didn't know I could play music until I tried this book.,"It was a birthday present from my sister and I use it all the time. I think if you want to learn to play harmonica, this is a great way to start."
4,Nice tank -- unique look,"I'm always on the lookout for new styles of tank, so I gave this a try. I was quite happy with it and am going to giv ethe other colors and materials a try. The 2 xist brand is on eof my favorites right now. This tank is an inbetween, if the square ""G unit"" style is too much for you."
1,Very Poor Quality,"These Chinese made tools are made from inferior steel. The jaws are ground so poorly that the cutters will not cut soft wire. Spend more and get a real tool, I certainly will!"
2,"Quality fine, price too high","I have about ""way too many"" of different brands of this. This was a last minute XMAS gift, and I should have just pcked it up at the store for about 1/2 $. Oh well"
3,So much to say -- so little room.,"I thought that the premise of this book was excellent. I loved the idea of a book that explored all the different roles that women play today -- and grounding them in the historical background of how they have come to be.However, I think that this book ended up tackling too much in too few pages. The result is the feeling that you are often simply skimming the surface of the intended deeper meaning. There are a few passages where Cokie relates significant personal experiences (such as the one with her dying sister) that are deeper and very touching. But the lack of story-telling in the other chapters made me feel more like I was hurriedly skimming down a list of facts.I would have loved to have heard more of the stories behind some of the amazing women that Cokie speaks about in her book. Unfortunately, overall, the book lacks the kind of ""in-depth"" reporting that you would otherwise hear from Cokie on NPR."
1,why?,"Unless there are obvious problems with reading, why would a person need Cliff's Notes for this book? It is an incredibly simple, straight forward novel. I am not being offensive, but I am slightly stunned..."
3,Great for Study Guides,"In my English class we were required to read this book. Although I did read the novel we were told to complete a study guide with the novel. We were often asked to describe certain characters and the cliff notes helped a lot. Also if I missed a night of the reading it was simple just to scan the cliff notes and then read the novel in detail later. All in all, this cliff notes book was very helpful, but I do recommend that you read the novel because it is great."
4,"Fun, uncomplicated pop-samba from Brazil","I don't know the story on this guy, but this is a nice, poppy samba-cancao collection. Not stunning, but nice. Has a touch of forro and percussive samba as well, with bright, cheerful melodies and perky vocal choruses. Nice stuff; for prefab pop music, this stuff's a gas. I'm not sure when these tracks were recorded (the budget-line ""As Melhores"" best-of series is strong musically, but skimpy on packaging), Still, whenever it was made, the music is fine. It all starts to sound a lot a like, but it's still really fun. Recommended."
1,Not convincing!,"This book is selling old, modernist ideas about music which are totally unconvincing compared to the postmodern views of music (e.g., Lawrence Kramer, John Shepherd, George Lipsitz, Robert Walser, Richard Taruskin) I've been studying in musicology and ethnomusicology courses (where the profs just chuckle at Reimer's book). Why do my music education profs still believe this stuff?"
3,Wow,"Very expensive for something that looks like it didn't cost very much. I gave it as a gift and my mom said she really would've liked them and wished she could've had them, so maybe I'm just wrong. They are real glass though. And my mom has good taste for an older lady."
4,Good starting place,"Picked this up on a trip to Gothenburg. I like to try and pick up something when abroad, all good music is not Britsh (Scottish)/American or English language. Some nice tracks. Sundance Kid and Dom Andra stand out.Give it a try."
1,Preposterous,Never received the product. Don't buy from this guy. no tracking info was provided. major inconvenience. i had to get a refund because it never came. preposterous......
2,"not ""new"" looking","I ordered this book ""new"" and the spine wasn't broken, but the cover of the book was very creased and not ""new"" looking. Unfortunately, i had no time to return it before i gave it as a birthday present. Obviously the book had not been read, but the cover was very sad looking. Probably won't order from this vendor again."
1,Dried out and tasteless,"Very disappointed! Other reviews had my hopes up for some truly tasty sugar-free cookies, but all varieties I received were extremely dry and hard...ended up having to dunk them in milk to make them edible."
5,terrific,A great book on the study of Romans. Every CoC member should read it and let go of our Pelagian attitudes.
5,Very well written,"Max has a gift for writing. There are books out there that discuss grace in more depth, but this is a great place to start. Max provides practical discussions of grace and this book is such a pleasure to read."
5,The book does not provide the entire salvation story,"Eph 2:8 makes it very clear that we are saved by grace through faith. Max does a nice job on the grace part, which is God's part, but completely ignores the faith part, which is man's part. Man's part, faith, as Hebrews 11 and James 2 easily show, is much more than mentally accepting Jesus as the Son of God and as a personal saviour. I truely hope Max has a sequel in the works so precious souls well not feel safe in the salvation he has shown them in In the Grip of Grace."
2,Tired and disappointing guide to book collecting practises,"With reservations I bought this book hoping that it would offer something fresh in the way of book conservation tips, shelving systems, organization, or even a pleasant excursion into the slightly mad world of book collecting. I was more tired than disappointed then, though a bit of both, to find that this is a far too breezy compendium of advice better gleaned from any number of more interesting sources. Readers would be better served to turn back to the masters of the genre---writers like Vincent Starrett, Christopher Morley, or John Carter, for the lore and practise of book collecting, and to the Bro-Dart catalogue for the tips on maintaining a collection. All in all, I thought this was a lackluster effort."
5,great book,"read this book about 4 times now. I'm a nerd. love the games, and when im feeling sad because diablo III has damned yet to come out, I pull out one of the diablo books and feel a little less empty inside... lol not that nerdlike. But it's really not a bad read."
5,Learned something new in this one,I have viewed many documentary films on African American history and culture and only hear about the Underground Railroad in passing. This is a very good educational documentary that details the path and roots that slaves took to reach freedom as well as the role the white abolitionists' played in helping.This is all new film footage for me and I now understand who the black woman everyone called Moses. There is a lot of good stuff in this DVD and I fully recommend you purchase it. I never know that the final destination was Canada I always thought the salves sort freedom in the Northern States.
3,Heritage,The content of the DVD itself was as so many African-Americans. It is a reminder of the struggle of those before us. The Dvd arrived in bad conidition. The cover was cracked and subsequently the Dvd was permanently scratched. It was truly a disappointment. It caused me not to order from Amazon for a while.
5,Fender Pickguard,This is a fender factory part supplied in original factory packaging. Installed one on my three tone sunburst strat along with black knobs and pickup covers. Perfect fit. Improved looks 300 percent!
4,Affordable elegance and value,"This is one good watch which has both elegance and value at affordable price. The technology,high standards and elegant designs of Citizen watches definitely enhance their value. My wife was really happy with her birthday present."
4,Great Price Works Great,This product works as it should it is offical. Charger works fine. No complaints good price too.
4,exactly what I needed,"All in one package, controller, battery, and charging cable. The battery worked fine at first and then I didn't use it very often. I guess when it is not charged frequently the battery dies."
3,Ford Blue oval universal -- fit seat cushion .,"Fast deliver but wrong product compare with the photo and as described . In The photo, it's look much thicker cushion but the real one they sent to me is very thin.It has been return...I need the thicker one like it showed in the photo ."
2,FORD BLUE OVAL CUSHION,DISCRIPTION STATES STRAPS & HOOKS.IT ONLY HAS 1STRAP AROUND BACK.WON'T STAY IN PLACE.NEEDS AT LEAST 2 MORE STRAPS TO KEEP IN PLACE.
1,bad buy,"this item would have been just what we were looking for , and the price was great , but upon the first use the spring broke , and i thunk they should have to replace them at no cost. My husband uses pliers every day making crab pots and they are very vital in his business he was really dissapointed,Thank you Diane Ashland"
5,Smart!,"I'm no expert on Web design. However, I do spend a great deal of time fiddling with badly desined web sites. Certainly everyone has encountered a web site that made them want to scream.I do understand what is involved in building a web site, we build them regularly. Ani Phyo is very intuitive and approaches her subject matter with great finessse. I have interacted with sites that she and her partner have designed and clearly, they get it. Not only are the sites intuitive and smart but they take it to the next level. They have an organic nature that transcends what you'd expect on the web. Their sites are breathing, living organisms. To encounter them is to be a part of a community. Yes, a community! Isn't that what the Internet is all about?I highly recommend this book mostly for the client. The client needs to define their needs and comprehend what is possible. The designer can take it to the next level."
4,Another Winning Effort,"I bought Steve's first album and have bought every one since. While Alive on Arrival is a ture classic, Steve's later albums at times are hit and miss affairs. This album is one of his best in years. A nice mix of softer ballads and uptempo rockers with his usual worderful insights. Hey, I bought it when it was origninally released and it has stayed very close to my cd player since then. If you are new to Steve's Music, Alive on Arrival is the ticket, but if you already own that I would suggest Rocking Horse Head."
5,great knife,"Picked this knife up at a gun show a few years back. Came with leather sheath. Excellent knife, Nice and sharp and grip is very comfy. A proud addition to the tradition of great combat knifes by K-Bar."
4,Almost terrific.,"Only negatives: I can't plug in my turntable. With 5,000+ albums, that's a problem. And, while each of five CDs can be set to randomly play tracks, you can't get random play on the collection.Apart from those two items, it's a fine unit, good range - if a bit heavy on the bottom end. My wife figured out the remote faster than I did - and that's a good sign."
5,Good phone!,This is a nice phone for the price. Very easy to set up and works great. Very clear reception.
3,so so,"This is a simple home answering machine. It is made by a company other than AT&T; but has paid to use the AT&T; logo.Some glaring defects are the lack of a back lit display and the dismal audio quality on the speaker output.There is only one outgoing message available. My old AT&T; model had three choices, one of which was played only to a user specified calling number. This was good for telling pesky telemarketers to go away.There is no battery backup so you have to reset the clock after each power interruption.You have to set the clock on the hour because there is no way to enter the minutes. It assumes you set the clock on the hour and sets the minutes to zero."
4,great phone for a great price,"I use this phone for my home office. Speakerphone quality is great and the MUTE button is really helpful (with baby and puppy making noises while on con calls).Big buttons, easily readable caller ID screen.The only downside is the sound. Even the lowest settings is pretty damn loud."
5,How a phone should work,"Found this product to be of the typical high standards of AT&T products. Not only easy to use and program, but found the big numbers to be an additional bonus. Thank yoy Ma Bell."
1,Disappointing AT&T product.,"I bought this phone/answering machine to replace my previous AT&T phone/answering machine, which lasted for 15 years before it stopped ringing. This phone is awful. The number buttons all stick unless you only push on the edge of the button. The sound quality for messages is very poor. My outgoing message sounds like I am underwater, and incoming messages are less clear than I would like."
1,Keep looking,"Actually, this is about a predecessor model 1818 which was bad to begin with (poor tonal quality); the speaker then began fading in and out both for phone calls and for message replay, and finally, the buttons stopped working entirely --- all within the span of six years of fairly limited home use. When I compare this machine with the durability of my old Panasonic tape machine, which lasted over 15 years, I rate the AT&T product as wholly unacceptable. Even when new, the tone quality of the message recorder was so bad, it was often difficult to decode messages and, more importantly, call-back numbers."
1,Disappointing,"I have spent the last three days trying to program this phone and it just gets more and more exasperating. There are 30 buttons on a 4 1/2 by 4 1/2 inch area and if you touch the wrong button, it is either erasing the information just entered, changing the settings, or recording phone conversations or ambiant noise. The read out is hard to see and it has only recorded one caller ID and now that functon has stopped. My other phone with caller ID is still recording the information so I know there is nothing wrong with my phone service. Yesterday it started blocking all outgoing calls altho I can still get incoming calls, I don't have a clue what is going on with this phone. In the past 10 years I have purchased well over 500 items from Amazon and this is the first time I have ever had any kind of problem. I know there are good reviews with this product but the one I have is a real DUD."
4,phone,I like most features of the phone except that it is designed so it cannot be held with the shoulder as the mouthpiece is smaller than older phones.
1,OK but broke quickly after warranty expired,"I bought this as an upgrade from a supermarket $35 model and found the picture quality sometimes better, sometimes about the same as the much cheaper camera. After over a year, the H error code started flashing in the lcd. I can now take one or two pictures at a time before I have to remove the battery in order to reset the camera. The flash often fails to work even with brand new batteries because I have tried new batteries and film. Sigh. The warranty had expired so I am left with an $80 piece of junk. Fortunately, my cheap camera had not sold at our yard sale so it's back in service. I am sorry that Canon is now making disposable cameras and marketing them as durable."
2,PACKAGED VERY POORLY!I,"I purchased this item back when it was only $43.00? It was packaged so poorly I returned it back. It's a standard 30"" bar stool. Go to Lowes or Home Depot."
4,Unique,This book is unique in that it provides a (partially) parallel treatment of Western and Eastern Armenian. It is also extensive in its treatment of grammar and other aspects of the language. I gave it 4 stars instead of 5 because it is full of grammatical mistakes in the English explanations (the author is apparently not a native English speaker) and doesn't seem very well-organized.
5,FANTASTIC!!!,This has ALL of the many classic songs that Michael Schenker has performed on over the years. An incredible live performance featuring his best backing band ever. Sorry Cozy ;) but Shane Galaas teamed with Barry Sparks? FUGETABOUDITT!!!
3,Stroker Ace VHS.,"Stroker Ace is Certainly no Smokey and the Bandit 1 and 2. This movie is lacking alot, and would appeal to die-hard Nascar fans, I am not a big fan per se. But there are some cameos from famous drivers. Again, This is not one of Burt's Best sadly."
2,"Soul soul soul soul... is every 10th word ""soul""?","This is less of a home book and more of a ... spiritual book? And not a very good one at that.""The round shape of an apple reflects the completeness of the soul."" The sentence after that compares the apple to a body part. Seriously? What does this even have to do with a home? And the number of times they use the word ""soul"" is just absurd.I gave it two stars for the photos - I would almost call them photo vignettes of homes or details of homes. Good photos that are fairly timeless. If there had been more photos and less text I would probably have given it more stars but to me the text really just ruined the book and since 3/4 of the book is text... well you get the point.Obviously there are some people who liked this book but I was not one of them."
3,The complete hardware?,"I was amazed by the fact that one author can put so much about the PC hardware in one single book. However, recently I have been playing with the PC keyboard and have expected useful info from the book only to discover, that the chapter on the PC keyboard is at least incomplete regarding the scancodes. More accurate info can be found on the Web."
2,Memorex MC2485 Dual Alarm AM?FM Clock Radio Telephone W/CID,I purchased this product and it was very hard to read the time on the clock. And the Caller ID name and number.Then when I went to pick up the reciver for the telephone all I got was a lot of static you couldn't even talk on the telephone. That is why I returned the product. Also the key pad on the phone was not lighted so you had to turn on lights to use the phones keypad.
3,"clock was o.k. but, you had to look up at it to see the time",phone was very light weight. wasn't to bright Always had to get up out of bed to see the time just about.
3,it's decent,For the money it is ok... but a simpler wrapping might be more handy for fitting in a pocket just to keep from scratching. I found it bulked up the tiny camera more than I wanted... so I wound up rarely using it.
4,Learn Italian easily,Simple stories teach vocabulary and grammar. The stories are interesting and appropriate. Provides practice if you have had instruction. Questions after each story reinforce reading.
3,Buy the one with CD instead unless you can't hear,"This book is sold separately with the CD, so only buy this edition if you can't hear or your instructor specifically tells you not to get the CD. Search for ""Easy Italian Reader with CD"" and note that the link at the time of doing this review for the one with CD is: http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/0071603344/ref=oh_details_o00_s00_i00 . With the CD the average rating is 4-1/2 stars.In fairness to people teaching languages, they may think their own dialect of the language is the only right. Italians can be very supportive of the towns they grew up in, but my wife's teacher knows formal Italian and chose this product. The class is non-credit and a local Sons of Italy activity for its members who mostly don't speak Italian but have an interest in Italian culture and/or food."
2,"Same old, same old","This book is the sort that makes one think, ""gosh, I could do better than that"". It's a very standard, somewhat tedious mystery where the perpetrator is obvious early on. I expected better from Simon Brett."
3,Try it!,"Have owned this CD for some years now....I understand that Cristian was Cheap Trick's keyboard player in the early 80's.Pretty decent pop rock songs....great singer, ala Journey,Foreigner,etc.Did a group album a couple years later called Big Mouth ""Hands of Time""."
4,Chain quilts made easy,This is a good book for beginning quilters. It helps you understand the process and how it all should look when finished.
1,So Disappointed,"I was so eager to own this movie starring Cicely Tyson that, back when I bought it, I didn't take time to read the reviews. I wish I would have. The picture quality of this DVD is very poor. It looks like it was recorded off the television while the station was messed up due to inclement weather. I was so disappointed. I'm hoping for a digitally remastered release of this movie, because I would still like to own it."
1,complete and total garbage,this book has the distinction of being the most useless book I have wasted the time to read.
2,No mention of Hobie Kayaks,"If you have a Hobie Mirage Drive, do not bother with this book. At least half is dedicated to problems and issues we will never have.The whole book is not bad though, with good sections on navigation, following seas, safety etc.If you have a Hobie and are looking for specific information, you will not find it here.The mirage drive system blows other kayaks away. No comparison. The fact that this book makes a conscious effort to ignore Hobie is a shame and dis service. Shelley seems to have blown it. I can only guess why.The book is by no means ""Complete"""
2,"A dry, flat lump of a book","It must take a special talent to write about a character as dynamic as Alexander the Great and render him as interesting as a cold lump of grease floating on dirty dishwater, but that's what Manfredi has done here. This book is wooden, stilted, superficial and unconvincing. But at its worst moments the dry flat prose bestirs itself and waxes turgid and silly, and I literally cringed as I read it. The only character that takes on any sort of life at all is Phillip; the character, motivations and nature of Alexander himself are left blank by this mediocre effort at chronicling his formative years. I can only hope the Italian original was somewhat better. Won't be continuing on to read the others. When will I ever learn that ""New York Times bestseller"" is by no means a sign of quality?"
3,A good story; bad writing,"The story of Alexander is an amazing one, but in this book is boring because Valerio puts too many descriptions out of the story, I have the three books but I will read the other two between books to keep me in the mood to read Alexander. I will read them because I want to know more of his life."
2,Dissapointed,"One of the main reasons I purchased this CD was because of the song ""Money Won't Change You."" This song is listed as #2 on Disc Two and it is not there! I checked all of the songs on this 2 Disc CD and ""Money Won't Change You"" is no where to be found. I would appreciate some feedback and an exchange on this CD as it is not what I expected nor paid my hard earned money for."
5,Bob Marley keychain/keyring.,"We gave our grandson a B. Marley themed Xmas. We did check with his mother to make sure ea. of the B. Marley gifts chosen would work. This was one given to him from our son and daughter-in-law...his uncle and aunt.I by no means promote pot smoking, but know B. Marley wrote good music and lyrics. We want to give him gifts he enjoys realizing much at his age is a faze and there will be many. He knows where I take my stand."
4,Beautiful sounds and great vocal harmonies.,I found this to be a very intimate sounding album. The songs are beautiful and have deep emotions and thought to them. Daybreak is particularily moving. Russell Hitchcock has an incredible voice and Graham Russell is definitely a master at writing love songs. The more you listen to it--the better it is.
5,Gremlins book,This was a gift to a grandson. He has really enjoyed it. Sorry it took so long to respond about it.
2,not among his best,"Of all Dr. Seuss' wonderful, inspiring and delightful books, .... this is not one of them.It's very long and rather monotonous. More birds, more eggs, over and over again. There are only 2-3 pages of anything besides that. And unlike some of his other books, this one doesn't seem to have a shred of educational or inspirational element."
5,Delightful,"Other reviewers have stated the storyline so well that I will not re-hash it here. I loved that Emily is plain and overweight - as she states herself ""she inherited her mama's mousy brown hair and pudding bag figure."" What a wonderful twist to actually make the duke prefer (and eventually come to love) such a plain woman when he had four lovely blond beauties awaiting selection as a bride. A Regency novel just like the TV show ""The Bachelor!""Jarad (the Duke of Montford) truly did have a dilemma - in fact several. And he was getting no where close to solving them. Most Regency's never supply men solid friends outside of drinking and gambling clubs, so I especially enjoyed Jarad's relationship with his cousin/secretary. All the other characters are well fleshed out with stories of their own to follow.Highly recommend. I could hardly put it down!"
4,"nice, but seller wasn't great","""It was missing several of the wooden dowels to hold the thread. I ended up contacting the company that makes the thread rack because this company was not interested in helping me at first. Later they offered, but by then I had already gotten help from the company. In any event, the rack is great and holds a lot of thread"
4,Useful,"This rack is a very useful tool in the art of sewing. Capable of holding a huge amount of spool of thread, it keeps things in your sewing quarters very well and neatly organized."
4,The Hardball Times Baseball Annual 2006,This was the first time I ordered this book.I was surprised at the amount of information that was found in this book.If you are looking for expanded informations about baseball stats this is a book for you.There is also wonderful articles about baseball in this book.
3,"Began ufos in the Bible. ""Yahweh Encounters "" proved it.","When a religious figure writes of UFO's in the Bible people read. While the idea started a movement, little scientific evidence is presented, such as can be found in Sitchen's books or in ""Yahweh Encounters: Bible Astronauts, Ark Radiations and Temple Electroics"" by Ann Madden Jones. However I recommend any Bible-UFO book by either a religious figure or one using detailed secular research to augment the Biblical evidence."
5,I love this game so much!,"I remember first playing this game at an early age in the late '90s. I received it at a Christmas gift in 2002 and have been playing it over and over again ever since. I love the soundtrack, I love the characters, I love the storyline, I love the dragon/accension system, I enjoy the idea of having masters teach you skills, or learning skills from enemies, and I for sure enjoyed the boss fights! This is my favorite RPG game of all time, and one of my favorite childhood memories. I think the graphics are awesome, for being made in 1998! The characters and locations in the game are beautifully drawn in my opinion. There are plenty of people that aren't fans of the music, but I think the soundtrack rocks! This game is amazing, and completely worth every penny!"
3,Breath of Fire 3,Was purchased for an older teen. He enjoyed the game but quickly tired of it & traded it after a few months. It was in good shape & had a good price. I think he got his plays worth from what we paid.
2,Don't Get This Game,"This Game is alright but I got bored of it after a while.It has really hard puzles and you're constantly fighting. I liked it when I first got it, but then I just got bored. If I were you I wouldn't waste my money. The first breath of fire for super nintendo was great though."
4,swamis,great cd go out and get it. i know the drummer and he is a real cool guy. as well as is the rest of the band. this is thier second release. first being mainly covers. and is absolutly worth the money and time spent listening to it. even if your not a huge jazz/swing/whatever fan pick it up youll be plesantly suprised.
1,unoriginal video,"this video is ""ok"". Its nothing to write home about. vic shows you a couple of tricks then runs off. there are alot of instructional videos out there that are unbelievable. studiobassplayer.com are excellent! the playing is amazing and to the point. The best videos are the ones that dont use celebrities to sell the videos"
3,Oversimplistic and information-poor,"Only the most obvious is stated, and then only in the simplest possible way, with no background information, no ""story"" behind each symbol, its use by particular artist at particular time in history etc.On the other hand very visual in presentation, therefore rather clear and simple, easy to understand.Recommended if you are interested in the subject on a very superficial level."
5,Ed Schmid knows his way around a blowpipe,This is flat-out the BEST book currently available on learning how to blow glass. Ed has been working with and teaching others how to work with hot glass for years. Buy it. Read it. Do it!
5,Wanna learn to blow glass? Get this book first.,"I learned a great deal from this book and even more from Ed's Advanced Glassworking Techniques. If you're planning on taking a class, want to learn about glassblowing or already blow glass and want to improve, I promise you'll find value in these two books. Ed explains the process in a really straightforward and fun way; he's much more knowledgeable and helpful in book form than just about every 'teacher' I've met in person. Since there are about 100 ways to skin a cat or make things out of glass, even if you've worked around skilled glassblowers you'll still get insights about why glass does what it does and how you can coax it to do what you want. I think I read the Advanced book about 100 times over the years and I highly recommend these books to anyone getting into glass.And the bonus of it all is I met Ed briefly at Pilchuck and he's a super nice guy to boot."
5,Great Item!!!!,Item was sent on time. I am a huge Red Sox fan and this mousepad is a must have for anyone.
2,doesn't really do waht it's supposed to do...,"i bought this thinking it would get out some tiny, hairline scratches from my motorcycle's finish. but it really didn't do anything but clean it. if you want to just clean it really well, then it works good for that but trying to compound tiny scratches...i'd buy a different product. or maybe a more aggressive compound..."
5,One Great Card,"I purchased one of the cards when I got my OLYMPUS c3040. The 16MB cards are too small for a camera like this. Now I don't have to change cards (or at least not very often). If you're shooting panaroma's at all, don't settle for anything less."
4,The Card DOES Allow You to Pick High Quality,Some one wrote a review that said you can't pick the high picture quality option when using this particular 64 meg card.... He was wrong..... it works on my c-3030... don't let him stop you from getting a great product. He is misinformed.
3,Check out the 128MB SmartMedia Card,Before you buy this card you may want to take a look at the 128MB SmartMedia cards. I personally purchased a Viking 128MB SmartMedia card (SSFDC3/128) because it was less expensive than buying two of these 64MB Olympus cards and having one card is very convenient.Keep in mind that if you set your camera to the highest quality setting that each image will be around 6MB each. That would only be 10 images on this 64MB versus 21 images on the Viking 128MB SmartMedia card.
2,Marginal tool for board review,"This is a question book that uses Neurology in Clinical Practice as its cross reference. I estimate that there are about 500 questions, formatted as mostly K-type, but also single best answer and true/false. Questions are arranged by chapter, as per NICP. My biggest gripe w/ this book is the quality of the questions and thoroughness of its answers. In addition, there are no illustrations or pictures of imaging studies given. I would not purchase this book again."
4,Oneida children's flatware,"The flatware arrived slowly, but in excellent condition and as advertised. We like it for you toddler and infant twins."
1,Low quality,"Once I received the flatware set, I was very disappointed. It looks like a little bit rough and is easy bend, the quality looks like a fake. I am trying to find a flatware for my little daughter with high quality, but this flatware definitely not."
4,a new take on an old legend,this was recommended by a friend. she told me i would recognize the story. it took me 20 minutes but i did recognize the story of a hero that is tricked for his strength and wealth that endangers his love. i had to stop half way through but was able to come back. a new take on a classic tale.
3,Beautiful movie...but,"Beautiful filming of a period piece. Weak direction, but the star and his female co-star have good chemistry.A good piece of Germanic lore that isn't well know to the U.S., so worth seeing."
1,"What's so ""special"" about this special edition???","After seeing the original mini-series on Scifi channel and then finding this DVD release on the store shelves I was very excited and looked forward to viewing this fine film over again without all the commercial time!But then I watched this disc and felt sooooo cheated!!! Over 50 minutes cut, and some of it the best stuff in the original film! Could it be that in this country that is so dominated by the right wing someone got nervous about all the pagan references?Bottom line, if you want to see the entire film in its original form DO NOT waste your hard earned cash on this not so special edition! Buy it used somewhere or better yet, wait for the ""directors cut""."
3,Dark Kingdom,"The acting was satisfactory. A considerable amount of artistic liberties were taken varying the story line and relationship of charactore to each other. It would be better to just present the original story line and try and explain the relationship of charactors to each other, A longer movie would be much better.Jim"
4,One of the most refreshing Mega Man games ever,"I will never forget the first time I played this game. A friend of mine had been talking about it for months when I was finally able to borrow a PlayStation and rent a copy of this game. It is really a fun Action RPG with elements of Mega Man, Indiana Jones, and Zelda."
5,Excellent,I enjoyed the book a lot. I have had the opportunity to work one on one with Mark Larson for a few years and I have learned a lot. I have passed this book on to a few friends that really appreciated the information especially on options. I would recommend this to anyone that wants a good primer on the basics of investing online.
4,It does the job,"This fan is easy to install and works without a problem. Bottom line, it does the job it's supposed to do at an affordable price."
3,MURKY CRYSTAL BALL,"Not knowing much about the history of this movie, it seems like it might have been a pilot for a tv series? At any rate, NOSTRADAMUS benefits from sharp performances from Rob Estes and Joely Fisher, and some good pacing. Estes plays a detective who apparently is the real 16th century prognosticator, Nostradamus. Although it's never really explained in full, it makes for some interesting plot twists. The special fx aren't all that special, but the movie keeps your interest by throwing many different plausibilities at you. The ending is definitely open for a sequel or a series, hard to tell which!!"
5,This Charming Album,"I recently heard about this album from a friend, and after coaxing me, I decided to buy it. He is such a big Smiths fan, so like a good friend, I decided to give it a listen. What I heard was simply amazing. I never heard lyrics before that really touch the listener like Morrissey does. Johnny Marr is incredible, as well as the other members of this band. After hearing this, I am really happy I bought this. My favorites are This Charming Man and Hand In Glove, as well as others. Buy this album now!"
4,"not their best, but an above average debut effort","This is not the first album a newcomer to the Smiths should purchase for the simple reason that like most bands (including the greatest) the debut effort often includes not so great production and the immaturity of youth. But with a band so outstanding like the Smiths, at the end of the day you still can't go wrong. While the album (again, as to be expected) even includes some throwaways (""miserable lie,"" ""pretty girls""), it also happens to include some of the Smiths most beautiful and poetic (""hand that rocks the cradle,"" ""suffer little children"") as well as some timeless anthems (""this charming man,"" ""still ill""). Not their best, but for a debut this strong, an exciting taste of things to come."
4,"over-produced, but still very underrated album","This album sounds like it was recorded with a heavy-handed producer... most evident on tracks like ""what difference does it make?"" -- have a listen to ""The Butterfly Collector"" bootleg or the ""Peel Sessions"" and hear what some of these songs originally sounded like. However, some of the most gorgeous Smiths songs are on this album -- ""Reel around the fountain,"" ""I don't owe you anything,"" ""The hand that rocks the cradle"" (although have a listen to bootleg versions of this one, too -- a totally different song is revealed!), ""suffer little children."" A must-have for Smiths fans and Morrissey fans who want to know where it all began."
2,An interesting beginning,"As a Smiths/Morrissey fan, one is almost obligated to rave about this album. I could never really warm up to it. Aside from the excellent songs that became the singles, the other tracks leave me cold. Its shows the promise yet to come, but this one is a little raw for me. It does and will stand as a mile stone of modern alternative music."
2,Simply unrealistic,"I was very disappointed in this book. The main character was out of her mind, you do not stay in an abusive relationship, Christian or not! I thought her reactions to Tanner's abuse were unrealistic. I would not want either of my girls to read this book for fear that they would think that the relationship between Stacy and Tanner was acceptable. I thought the plot line wrapped up a bit too neatly in the end, the writing was creative enough to keep my attention. Overall, poor story line and frustrating plot!"
2,"Formula driven blues by ""newest sensation"".","Rock critic Rick Hagedorn says ""If you do nothing else with your life, buy it on the way home"". I did, and wondered why. Not bad for a neophyte but, is there really anything here you haven't heard before? E.C. nodding off with a needle stuck in his arm plays circles around these wanna-be's."
2,Downgraded for vocals,"As a Blues fan, I throughly enjoyed Ledbetter Heights. As fans know, Ledbetter went platinum shortly after its debut. With success like that, it is hard to imagine that lead singer Corey Sterling, now with the Chris Aaron Band, would be dumped for a greasy, load mouth exhibitionous performer like Noah Hunt. My 2 star rating is attributed to the vocals. I for one do not like the change."
1,disappointment,"The music wasn't bad, however the vocals are a MAJOR disappointment. I kept expecting something better with each song. Then I realized the problem; there was no raw feelings conveyed, no personality, no life. You can't sing blues songs with a polished pop voice."
4,Wow!,"Too bad there's no such thing as Top-40 radio to expose Shepherd's talent. ""I Found Love"" is worth the price alone. ""Blue On Black"" will still sound good in 20 years. Excellent Blues/Rock CD."
3,Wait And See,"I keep hearing about how Kenny Wayne Shepard is going to be the next Hendrix, SRV. Fact is, this will never happen. Though a talented player he lacks the creativity of a Hendrix. I have both his albums and I have to say that his version of I Don't Live Today is the worst I have ever heard, and I have heard a million bad versions of this song. Technically he is a good player, but every single shuffle has been beat to death. Changing a note here and there, or changing the tempo does not make it origional. There is a song on his fisrt album called ""while we Cry"" that sounds oddly like a live version of SRV's ""Lenny"". Much is made of him being only twenty, but that is not so unusual there are kids all over the place half his age playing at the same level he does. Music is not about age it's about expression.. If you can't get across to your listeners it does not matter how old you are."
3,"Trouble is, is not great but it,s good.","I do not agree with the gentleman from Fairbanks Alaska, but I do agree with the fan from Ohio, it doesnt live up to Ledbetter Heights."
4,"Live- in Memphis, TN",I saw the band in Memphis at B.B. King's. The band sounded good. Check out Eric Jerardi Band for a recomendation. Peace.
5,Legendary Seattle Band,"Seeing the reunited Red Dress recently prompted me to buy this double CD. They are an incredible band that should've been a big deal, but alas they were too original even for their time. One CD is live and one is studio so you get both experiences. A must have."
1,Disappointing,"I am a long term Jack Higgins fan who was sorely disappointed by this book. It doesn't read like somthing he wrote, or else its somthing he put together when he was first starting out. The characters, the dialogue and overall pace of the story is all wrong, in my opinion. I wonder if others feel the same way."
1,IT SUCKS,"this game .... there is no switching between characters, the game is plagued with slowdown, and the animations are hacked.... do not get it,it is not worth it, you will just be dissapointed."
2,What was Capcom thinking?,"I actually played the Saturn version with the 4MB RAM cart, and I have to say that the PS1 version SUCKS! Why? Because tag-team was taken out because the PS1 could not handle it. It did not have enough RAM (Random Access Memory) to switch fighters since it takes about at least 40 MB of RAM, and the PS1 only has 32 MB. If Capcom did put in tag-team, then it would take forever to load up a character once you tag-team with it, you can tag-team with the same character, but it does not feel the same.I suggest get a Saturn, (it is only $10 bucks or less) get a 4MB RAM cart which you can find at EB.com, or any Video game store, and get the Import version of X-men vs. Street Fighter, trust me you wont be disappointed."
2,"Leather sticifier, not conditioner",Leaves leather seats so sticky that it is difficult to slide in and out of the car. Requires cleaner before hand. Very disappointing.
2,This guy's no Walt Whitman.,"Ochester's is a modest talent, and all too often in this retrospective, plain-speaking devolves into the merely plain and into under- or unachievement. There are a few assured and forcible passages, some wisecracks verging on the clever, and long swaths of lazy-man prose. A mixed bag, to be sure, but certain to please the claque."
4,"Love Sarah, dump the male voiceovers","This is a work of art. I listen on the iPod on the bus and laugh out loud. Great history lessons with a lot of humor mixed in. If my high school history teacher had been like Sarah, I might have learned something. I love her details and the tangents that add so much spice to the historical info.Sarah's voice grew on me -- it's almost annoying but just quirky enough to be interesting. Don't understand why they found it necessary to dub in the male voices some of the time; inconsistent, disruptive, didn't add to it at all. Give me Sarah!"
5,"High School Teachers, take note!","This is the rarest of all things: a work of non-fiction that I just could not put down. Vowell makes obscure historical figures and the places related to them fascinatingly relevant to the modern reader. Snarky, irreverant, peppered with personal anecdotes that actually add to the narrative instead of detract from it, Assassination Vacation should be required reading for every high school history class."
1,For Presidential History Geeks Only,"I like Sarah Vowell's personality and normally enjoy reading her books and listening to her on This American Life. Plus she kicked ass in The Incredibles.I found this book really dull reading though. Unless you, like Sarah, are obsessed with the tiny details of President Garfield's presidency (and other subjects equally dry) you may be as bored as I was. She herself keeps saying how the companions she brings along on her research trips are bored to tears by the subject matter.I look forward to her next book and a return to more interesting territory."
1,A Wasteful Indulgence,"Ms Vowell takes the poetneially interesting subject of Presidential Assassinations, and their political and historical impact on America, then proceeds to create a manifestly awkward, confused and uninteresting self indulgent narrative. Her story is unenlightened and disjointed and no sense of history or policics evolve. She creates endless prose that has no sense of style, direction or interest. It's a story more suited to someone serious about the opportunities of the subject and less desireous of listening to their own voice."
2,needs a warning label,"This book is pretty good. It has excellent writing and interesting subject matter. Ms. Vowell avoids a 5-star rating, however, by annoyingly attempting to relate events of 100+ years ago to current events. Her displeasure of the current Presidential administration (and conservatives in general) sounds as though it were copied directly from moveon.org talking points. Sticking to her subject matter would have been much more interesting and entertaining. Continued jabs at Republicans and Christians make this book insulting and distant for me. If I wanted to hear about the author's political views, I would have searched for this book in the political opinion section. Maybe liberals will enjoy hearing the ""where are the WMD's"" song played again, or possibly the ""Bush didn't win the popular vote"" song, but I'm tired of hearing it and I wouldn't have paid for it had I known of the book's content."
3,Just for a little morbid fun - go elsewhere for full facts,"The assassinations of Abraham Lincoln, James A. Garfield, and William McKinley provide the author a chance to take a vacation and share her philosophy with readers. She certainly has an off-beat sense of humor, a quality of the book that might be off-putting to those who think that the murders of United States Presidents should be treated in a more serious way. It is interesting that she did not give her flippant treatment to John F. Kennedy, whose death is recent enough that there are still people alive who might take offense. The other poor fellows have been dead a long time. If you are looking for some light reading about a heavy subject, this is an option. If you really want to know the facts surrounding the events, go elsewhere."
3,Very Interesting,"This book is filled with unexpected laughs and ""Oh, I never knew that!"". The author is excellent on tying in facts and other historical persons to a particular event. I really enjoyed her humor and admire her passion for history."
4,Misunderstood?,"As always, this book was well-researched and very entertaining. Sarah has a way of humanizing history so that even the most controversial of historical figures, such as Booth and Mudd, are seen in a more human light. I did find it a little bit slower of a read than her previous novels, but so clever and informational, I enjoyed every word.I think however, looking at some of the other reviews, that maybe people misunderstood the concept behind this work. It is an account of the author's experience, her personal pilgrimage, which means she is likely to insert her own political views and feelings -which yes, may include her opinion of the current administration. It is not meant to be a non-fiction, non-biased account of history. It is relating human experience, in this case, Sarah's. So yes, I guess if that is what you are looking for, this probably isn't the book for you."
5,"History, social commentary, personal journey","I think some of the people criticizing Sarah Vowell's criticism of the current administration are missing the point. The beginning of the book she talks about how the current administration was the driving force behind her interest in the subject. So you remove that you remove the point behind her book. The book in its own way is amazingly patriotic and even if you don't agree with her own personal politics it doesn't make this any less of a worthwhile read.I found this book to be educational, funny, interesting and amazing. Although I probably wouldn't follow her footsteps it did make me interested in learning more about US history especially presidents and possibly creating a future theme for vacations with my family. I love anything that shows that history isn't just names and dates but interesting stories that can be reflected and thought about in terms of the present. This book does an excellent job of that."
2,A fustrating collection of spells...,"I'll have to agree with the previous statements made by the last person: nonsense with one-purpose-per-page babble. I'm sure most of these spells are worthwhile, and don't get me wrong; I think Valerie Worth is a very wise Witch... But this book is quite lacking.I recommend her far more superior sequel, ""The Crone's Book of Charms and Spells."" If you decide to purchase anything by Ms. Worth at all, that should be it. It's quite a beautiful read, and informative as well."
