5,Amazing,"Amazing - Simply Amazing.Doesn't get into Eschatological distinctions btwn Israel and the Church (good thing).Piper answers, rather, explains Paul's answer to this aching question marvelously"
5,Very pleased with this purchase!,"Item arrived within 2 days in brand new condition! Got this for my fiance for his birthday, and he loves it. VERY pleased with this purchase!"
5,One of the greatest bands ever!!!,D.R.I. is one of the most consistent bands ever.Every album is incredibly solid and this one isno exception. Full Speed Ahead is definitly theirheaviest and most METAL album to date. If youlike metal or punk you must buy this totallyawsome album.
2,"Much potential, little payoff.","I wanted to like this book. I TRIED to like it. Alas, I could not. More ridiculous scenarious unfold in just one day of the narrative than should appear in the entire book. The plot devices seem contrived (e.g., Jew-hater discovers he's half Jewish), and the action laughable. The main character, despite all her swashbuckling chutzpah, could not hold my interest. The writing seems amateurish, and while I enjoy the Parisian references, they seem forced and gimmicky. I'm one Francophile who couldn't stomach it."
3,murder,This book started out a little slow and picked up about halfway through. Was a pretty good read and I would read more of the series.
3,Not so hot.,"Purchased this out of love of Paris, but not really thrilled with it. There were a lot of mistakes that any proofreader or editor should have caught. Maybe it's a little nitpicky, but I found that distracting. Hoped that it was because this was a first novel."
3,Murder in the Marias,A fun book especially if you have been to Paris and the Marais. But if you haven't it will make you want to search out all the locations.
3,It was Okay,"I thought that this book was just okay. There were some sections that were a bit odd in the way it was written and that caused me to have to re-read entire paragraphs over a couple of times. I generally liked the book but due to the difficulty in easy reading, I am giving it 3 stars."
4,Paris murders,"I read the blog Parlez Paris from Adrianne Leeds who lives in Paris. She has mentioned these books the past few years and I finally order the first four in the series. It was a good read, with a good story and plotline that could only have happened in France. I loved trying to picture this young woman private detective roaming the city doing her thing some of it very action oriented. I've just started the second book, it will be entering to see how her writing progresses."
3,Unbelievable,and not in a good way. The main character appears to sideline as a stunt double for Superwoman. Leaping tall buildings and all that. I wish she had done a lot more detecting and less breaking/entering/climbing up buildings. I won't be buying another one.
2,I wanted to like this book,"I wanted to like this book. It had all the right characters, settings & historical venues, but it took advantage of none of these. The young female protagonist zips from one unbelievable scenario to another (I mean honestly, clammoring across slippery Paris roof tops in spike high heels? I can barely walk on a flat street in those puppies). And, what's with the dwarf assistant? That addition is just pure silliness.As with any plot set in Paris, the City itself must be a character, but this plot could have been executed in just about any city in Europe. It's not enough to drop the names of a couple of ""Rues"" & fancy cigarettes.I don't know if I'll read the sequels to this, her first, book."
1,"Well, There Weren't Typos","Just starting the book, but already having a misgiving or two. Within the first few pages the main character has caved to emotional blackmail & manipulation and then made every blunder possible when finding a corpse. I don't believe this is intended to be a bubble-headed unintentional heroine story... I'll continue read a while longer to decide whether or not to put it in the ""Too Stupid To Live"" category.****Okay, I've had enough. Too many holes. Too many ridiculous manipulations and coincidences."
2,Name dropper,This might have been an average mystery but it is like someone thought up a gimick. Let's sprinkle references to Paris throughout. It is just plain silly. Every other sentence has the author making some irrelevant reference to one Paris landmark or another. Definitely a niche market book -- people who really do not care for good mystery writing and are in Paris for the first time. Shame on website Bonjour Paris for pushing it.
2,D+,"This plot does not make since, the factual errors pervade this book (Glock pistols don't have safeties that you can disengage for example), and a leftist fashionista private detective the daughter of a senior cop and an American mother who abandoned her to be a communist terrorist as a child, who also has a strong distrust of the police and an unpleasant personality. Also somehow the author makes Paris seem almost as attractive as Detroit or Cleveland..."
2,"Sorry, but...","Sorry, I hate to pan anyone's first effort, but I couldn't get beyond the first couple of chapters of this book because of what I felt was poor writing. The premise was certainly interesting, but I found the author's choice of words sloppy and the characterizations wooden. (Now, I can practically hear my dad saying, ""If you can't say something nice, don't say anything at all."") I think the author shows talent, but she could have benefitted from a more discriminating editor."
1,Really Lame,"The people writing the 1 star reviews have it right. Just wish I had read them first and saved the time I spent reading this poorly written, confusing and silly plot."
1,disappointment,"I have just discovered this author and am extremely disappointedpoor plot, poor vocabulary ; greasy is the favorite adjectiveThe descriptions of the characters are practically caricaturesI had meant to buy all her books, same as I do with my favoriteauthors, sorry, no more"
3,"This warrants a gallic shrug--comme ci, comme ca","I love Paris. I particularly love the Marais district. And I love a good mystery. Sadly, this one didn't quite stitch all those loves together. It was a bit choppy and unrealistic at points but it had merit.I like the plucky Franco-American heroine with a weakness for bad boys, couture and Gaulois, in particular. And, in a series, it's an affinity for the main character that is first on my list of criteria.I also appreciated the author's insight into this fascinating neighborhood and its sad history. For francophiles looking for a virtual trip to Paris, this isn't a bad option.A flawed but still auspicious start. If the author has a little more of an assured voice (she overexplained a lot I believe but then glossed over other key clues/facts) in future books, this will be a series to savor."
4,The feeling of Paris,"I've visited Paris and the Marais many times and while reading Ms. Black's book I could see steam rising off the sidewalks, hear the sound of the chase echoing off walls, and clearly envision the office upstairs. First effort, indeed, but a fleshed-out one with a seeming guarantee for not just more but better."
5,Solid evangelical resource on Leviticus,"Rooker presents a thorough exposition of Leviticus from an evangelical, faithful perspective. He draws on several resources to provide an accurate, rich commentary. His writing is simple and the content is comprehensive in its verse by verse exegesis and in the books introduction to Leviticus."
4,Nice light,This was everything I expected. We had seen one in a Christmas store but didn't buy it. We later regretted it and found this one on line.
2,Another book in the Archie McNally Series,"This is another book about Archie McNally, a modern day Bertie Wooster. I personally did not think this book was as good as some of the previous books, but possibly I have just grown tired of some of the characters. The lead-in is somewhat tedious as the plot develops slowly. This story reminds me of talking to someone who has trouble getting to the point, i.e., the person you try to avoid at a party. Sanders reuses a ploy used in a previous book, a shady investment advisor, although in this case it has a new twist. The book is written in first person and he seems to fill in a lot of space with minute details about the narrator. The second half of the book develops at a faster pace, with less of the excruciating detail of what type of jam Archie uses on his toast, and it becomes a more readable book, but only after one has plowed through the first half."
4,A bit pedestrian but still ok.,The trick here is not to emulate Travis McGee who is far too free-wheeling with his sex drives. There is still hope for McNally. Except for his petty weaknesses McNally did ok in this novel. The trick is taking him with a grain of salt. If you can't do that read some other sleuth.
4,"Sanders ""Gamble"" pays off!","With the very first ""McNally"" book I ever read, I was hooked. Now, each February, I race to the bookstore to get the latest one in hardcover.Archy captivates me, he is a riot! I want to read non-stop, but, as I get closer to the conclusion, I force myself to slow down--it's a long wait 'till the next February! This one is no different, Archy is a gamble worth taking!I'm so happy I found Amazon, now I won't even have to leave the house to get the next McNally treasure! Hmm, ""McNally's Treasure,"" perhaps the next best seller?(RoseAnn Gibbons"
4,I try not to read two McNally books in any six month period,"Using that strategy, the books stay fresh and entertaining. Archy McNally is kind of what you'd get if you crossed Lord Peter Wimsey with Cary Grant's character from the Awful Truth. He's urbane, irresponsible, retro and witty-- an unavoidably appealing combination. The plots themselves are more vehicles for Archy's charm, but are adequately written as such-- this one contains enough interesting background information about faberge eggs and con men to carry me through without getting horribly bored."
5,Lawrence Sanders does it again. Another great Archy story.,"Lawrence Sanders has a unique ability to convey the lifestyles of the rich to paper in a believeable fashion. His vivid descriptions of meals and wines, with just a hint of snobbery, are superb and have me wishing I were partaking of the victuals along with the characters. The story itself is up to the usual outstanding plot that Sanders (and McNally) fans have come to expect. I've read every one of the McNally series books and always look forward to the next. (The included vocabulary lessons in the stories are a plus). Don't miss reading the series and include this one."
4,A good read that is becoming formulaic.,"I am always pleased when onother McNally caper comes on the market. They are always an enjoyable read that is fairly well researched. This story lacks th grit to make it a five star story, but is as always a page turner."
4,Deepest Bluest,"LL is back with this new, rough, energetic style which he shows briliantly on this track. The song is tied into the movie ""Deep Blue Sea"" in which he stars. This song shows LL hollaring over a cool, fast up-tempo beat that seems to give a real sense of the underwater terrors in which he raps about. This is a good song and a must have for all LL Cool J fans!"
3,"Pat's review of ""The Message.""","I enjoyed the story, but it wasn't one that I couldn't take a break from. It wasn't long, so I read it in two evenings. My belief does not lie in all those lengthy events happening, but this is my opinion. Actually. by mistake, I purchased the wrong book, so take my opinion very lightly.. ...............Pat"
2,misleading meassage,"After having read many books and articles on the near death experience, I happened upon this one. I have to say that I am so very glad that this book was not my first experience on the subject.I should have explored the authors subject matter more online before purchasing to my Kindle, because time and money would have been saved and I would not feel taken advantage of.This author is clearly promoting his own religious agenda and damaging the credibility of the entire subject of the nde, as in my opinion, he was more likely dreaming."
2,Not the most exciting writer,"While this story deserves to be told, the author tends to quote a lot in ways I find not-so-believable. I consider a quote an actual statement, but he quotes people when he's not there (in person or in spirit). He takes a lot of license, and I think that with such an important subject, he should have been more general in what people said and not quote so much when it would be impossible to remember everyone's detailed words. The writing was trite. As I was reading, I felt the author was imposing views on me that were more his than perhaps what he was experiencing.I believe in NDEs and their validity, and I have now read a number of books on the subject. This was my least favorite."
2,Be Careful!,"Inspirational book from the standpoint of doing more for others than you do for yourself. But this only accounts for 5-10% of the content of the book. The cover of the book is misleading as it says ""if a man were to die, and then return, what message might those from the world beyond send back to us"". I find his experience hard to believe:- First, he doesn't die!- Second, I think his visions/experiences were drug induced, he was on heavy medication.- Third, his religious background (Mormonism) is prevalent throughout the book (i.e. city of enoch). One reviewer wrote that he didn't disclose his religion, but a little detective work shows that he does but he chooses not to put it in your face."
5,THE MESSAGE,"I HAVE TRUELY ENJOYED READING LANCE'S EXPERIENCE. WHAT A MESSAGE HE HAS FOR ALL OF US, THAT OF BEING OF SERVICE TO ONE ANOTHER. I'VE MEET LANCE PERSONALLY AND TALKED WITH HIM, HE IS A GENUINE PERSON. THIS BOOK IN MY OPINION THIS IS A FANTASTIC BOOK."
3,NDE,"Didn't really care for this book, have read a number of others in this 'field'............isn't really even interesting, rather boring"
5,Loved it.,Very insightful and hope giving book. I am having all my kids read it also. I want them to not be afraid and confused when my time comes. And knowing that I can help watch over them still is a very comforting thought to me.
5,Extremely moving!,"I would strongly urge all who read this book to take ""the message"" seriously. The author did a great job writing about his experience."
5,Great read. I loved it. It surpassed my expectations and kept me involved to the very end.,"I have recommended this book to several friends already. Some have read it and they have the same comment. I enjoyed this book more than others I have become acquainted with describing ""near death"" experiences"
5,I Love This Book and it's Message....,"I would love to share this with everyone. It ""rings true"". I hope more people will order this and see for themselves. I recommend it highly. Lance Richarson was a very humble good person and this book has made a big difference in my life. Loa"
2,Hard to slog through,"This book is good guidence for someone with a lot of dog training friends to collaborate with... if you are like the rest of us and lack such a gaggle of dog people ready and willing to lend a hand, it's not so helpful.Try control unleashed instead. A lot of the methods used in Bringing Light to Shadow are not very effective or well demonstrated. I was frustrated by the book esp how the author let Shadow beat on her other dogs to the point of drawing blood without intervening...positive reinforcement is fine, but even most positive reinforcement trainers would intervene in that situation!!"
2,"interesting, but not very relavant,","I read this is about an hour of skimming, an interesting project, but not I fear a good use of time and energy. This book feels like the mandatory ""see what I can do"" dog trainers book. Why keep a dog that fights /attacks your dogs and bites people? This dog has bitten several people, would you ever be able to trust a dog like this?I am glad the writer wrote this, when people with aggressive dogs call me, I refer them to this book, so they can see how long, slow, and possible no results, the process is of attempting to rehab a biting dog."
4,"A Good Mix, But Note...","This CD is a slightly extended version of the same release by 32 Jazz (the one with supermodel Leticia Casta on the cover). Where the 32 Jazz release has 11 songs on one CD, this new release contains 19 songs on 2 CDs. The song blend is superb; a great Sunday morning disc. Just wanted to give the original 32 Jazz owners a little heads up about this new collection. The choice is yours to invest in another, very similar CD, or stick with the one you already have.For those who are new to both collections, you will be pleased with the quality and mood of this CD."
4,down Argentine way,"Please, some record executive, provide liner notes! I speak ""un poquito"" Spanish but even liner notes would be greatly appreciated. I do know Silvetti is an Argentine artist who is well regarded for his piano art and that he also composes. Composes not only classical pieces but pop music. Here you'll find one majestic classic style piece but mainly it's Discoteque and pieces very reminicient of Burt Bacharach's music. And that's good 'cause Bacharach is marvelous, most lyrics are sung in English! Disco fans will be ready to put on their boots and white leisure suits and I think Silvetti wrote the scores for America's tv soap operas like DALLAS. Surprising and quite novel."
4,Absolutely likeable,"There are songs that simply strikes a chord with you instantaneously and this is one of them. It's spunky, lively ,upbeat and you just couldn't not move to it's beat. Instantly likeable.We sure would like to hear more from her in the near future.Welcome to the next Aussie ""wave"""
4,Good History but lacks numbers,"This book has great background of each season which is excellent. Lots of nice photos too. My only complaint is the description says indepth player statistics but books just list leaders, so don't expect a lot of numbers."
5,5 Stars Plus!,"This book and its companion volume to British Columbia are undoubtedly the best travel books I have ever used. I just returned from a two-month trip that took me to the Calgary Stampede, through the Rockies, up to Yellowknife and through British Columbia to Vancouver. Alberta is an amazing place to visit and by buying this book I was able to enjoy it all the more. The author has obviously done his homework and describes the region in a colorful style but also with an incredible amount of detail. By using these books I managed to plan my trip before leaving home, even down to where I wanted to eat. The other guide I had with me was rarely used. I also found local information centers sending me along well worn tourist paths, and while this book covers all of that side of Alberta it also led me away from the masses to areas of equal beauty. I highly recommend this book to anyone planning a trip to Canada!!"
5,This book was outstanding!,"This handbook was packed with great spots to stop. There were many places listed that the AAA guidebook missed, and all were fantastic. The book was sectioned well, breaking up different areas into day-trips. If you are going to Alberta for the first time, this is a MUST BUY!"
3,Good but not Great,I liked most of the stories but some I just wanted to get through. Not a bad deal for $5 or less.
3,"LOW-GRADE, BUDGET KARLOFF STARTER PACK ~","I picked this collection up when I was itching for some BK films that I'd never seen before. They were watchable enough on my old Sharp 27"" tube set, but now that I have a 40"" Sony LCD, these cheap, pixilated DVD's just don't cut it anymore. So now I try to get my flicks with the highest quality picture available. ALL OF THE FILMS IN THIS COLLECTION ARE AVAILABLE SEPERATELY WITH SUPERIOR PICTURE AND SOUND, some better than others of course, so shop wisely. This box set is a great way to inexpensively explore the works of one of the greatest genre actors of the 20th century, but if you are seriously building a Karloff collection and you care about picture and sound quality, well... as they say, you get what you pay for ~"
1,Not very bluesy,This is not the bluesy Memphis Slim were used to hearing. He plays more jazzy off the wall stuff that sounds like experimental jazz. Not recommended for blues fans.You can see a more bluesy Memphis slim on the American Folk Blues Festival DVDs.
2,slow shipping,"I paid for 1 day, overnight shipping; however, I have not received my package after 1 day. I needed the book for class and now I won't have it."
3,OK polymer textbook,"The book is becoming quickly outdated and lacks a comprehensive review of major advances in polymer chemistry. The book has a strong focus on reaction kinetics and equations as it pertains to both step growth and free radical chemistries, however, the synthesis and applications are lacking. The book could use a much better section on controlled radical polymerization. Overall not in love with the book, but it provides a solid fundamental understanding of polymer chemistry."
4,A handy reference,"I have been using this book for several years, including a term where it was the primary text for a graduate-level Introduction to Polymers course. As textbooks go, I have found this one relatively easy to read, and the concepts easy to follow. It it quite comprehensive, but assumes an undergraduate background in organic and physical chemistry. Since the course, it has been a handy reference in my research, though, as someone else noted, it is lacking in respect to living polymerizations, particularly Atom Transfer Radical Polymerization. However, Odian's work remains one of the most useful textbooks from my graduate classes."
3,The standard text for teaching polymer chemistry.,"The number of concepts covered in this book is amazing -- I learn something new with each reading. The book is also great for pointing you to the leading references in the field; although it is lacking decent coverage of living polymerization. Odian's book is not easy to read. For a chemistry book it includes relatively few chemical structures or mechanisms, so for students who don't already know chemistry it is a rather useless introduction A better introductory polymer chemistry book is by M. Stevens."
4,Making the Old New Again,"Beginnings, endings, murder, sex, adultery, treachery. The Bible is full of it all. Our Christian history. The Thompson Student Bible is a very readable, easy to use more youthful addition of the Thompson Chain Reference Bible. This bible has 45 portraits of such bible greats as Moses, Job, John the Baptist, Miriam and more linking their accomplishments with the verses where they are found. Study aids that give background information and history on the Bible, a list of fulfilled prophecies concerning Jesus Christ, charts on Bible People, and maps. This bible is one of the most complete I have seen. There is a condensed outline of the Bible that is very useful as it describes the main theme and focus of each book. I really like how this Bible gives the key people, theme, and lessons of each and every book in the Bible. This Bible will definetly be a large part of my Bible Study from now on."
5,Christmas Gifts,"I got two pairs of these for different people in my family. My step dad said he wasn't interested in any gloves for Christmas but once he tried on everyone else's he wished he had a pair for himself! Would highly recommend, makes a great gift!"
2,Difficult to use,"It is very difficult to properly align chisels in this guide. The design of the guide causes unequal contact to each side of the chisel, which results in inproper horizontal alignment. I plan on spending a little more money and getting a better designed guide. The guide does work better with plane irons, since they're mounted in a different part of the guide."
3,Good for the Money,I've used it to sharpen a couple of chisels and a small plane iron and it does a credible job. If you're an occasional wood worker this should suffice otherwise pay the extra for a professional unit.
1,Don't waste your money,"This thing doesn't works. I agree with the previous revision. Is practically imposible to align chisels under 1 1/2"" perdendicular to stone."
5,death/doom/blues/psychedelic/whatever metal,"This band's name is appropriate. Definitely sounds like they take a lot of acid. But whether they're on endless drugs or not, they've made a great drug album. This product of the Louisiana swamps is one of those albums that has to be described with lots of slashes: it's death/doom/blues/psychedelic/whatever metal. Lots of sludgy doom riffs, death-style tempo changes and evil lyrics, and an overall bluesy, psychedelic vibe. The vocals are cool, doing a good switch-off between death screaming and sorrowful crooning. Lyrics are lovely poetic evocations of hatred, torture, and death. A great album by a singularly strange band. Unfortunately, bassist Audie Pitre was killed in a car accident after this album came out, leaving the future of the band in doubt."
5,A Metal Album You Can Chill Out To,"If your looking for a metal album to burn a fat one to, then this is your disc. Its not WHEN THE KITE STRING POPS part 2 but it is still a classic metal album in its own right. Any metal fan that gives it a listen will enjoy anything by Acid Bath and will be glad that they added them to their collections."
2,Not enough energy,"This doesn't sound like the same band that made ""When The Kite String..."" at all to me. I liked 3 or 4 songs off of ""Paegan Terrorism Tactics"". The best tracks on the album IMO are ""Locust Spawning"", ""Diab Soule"" ""Paegan Love Song"" and ""Graveflower"". There's not enough energy on this album. There were maybe 4 heavy tracks. ""When The Kite String..."" chits all over this. lol"
5,Good and cheap.,"My brush hog chain drive broke a link, so I bought a couple oem replacements. Thhey didn't last very long at all. So I found these. They worked much better than the oem."
2,"Too Pricey, tough to chew, flavor better than average","Amazon's price is terrible on this product, especially as a bulk boxed item. This jerky is tougher than average, but has better than average flavor. Lower carbs than other brand's ""regular flavor""."
4,Good but not the best,I tried most of Jack Links' products. I will classified this one as good...but I personally prefer beef nuggets since it tasted juicier.
1,watch out for mold,"I purchased this product at the grocery store and when i got it home i opened the bag and each piece was coated in a thick grey mold. The expiration date was far from near. It was horrible. I got one wift of the smell and had to run out of the room. I am very careful when buying meat and i never feared buying jerky. Now i will think twice. As for Jack Link's, I will never purchase anything else from them."
2,A REAL LET-DOWN!,"What a disapointment! Whereas volume one of this book had at least a FEW tid-bits of interesting information, the material contained within volume two is totally worthless--at least to me. (But, then again, I DO have some pretty high standards when it comes to QUALITY astrological texts!) And it's a shame, because Steven Forrest is such a great astrological author. As for Jeff Green, although his Pluto book is pretty impressive, I've never really LIKED him as an author--too pompous, way too wordy, and extremely overrated! Why Steven Forrest ever decided to team-up with this guy I'll never know! Save your money, folks, and pass this book by."
1,Buyer beware,"My copy of this CD does NOT contain 17 tracks. It stops at 15, omitting the previously unreleased ""Jealousy"" and ""In Charge."" Since these two tracks are the only reasons I bought the disc, I feel immensely ripped-off. Anyone else have the same disappointing news to report, or did I just get a weird copy?"
2,puts strain on my shoulders and neck,"This works well fairly well but it does put alot of strain on my neck, arms and shoulders to use it. As I have back and neck issues it will likely go on a back hook to be ignored."
3,Cheesily sent WITHOUT THE POLE,The picture on the product packagingshows a person using the device holdingthe end of a pole stretching from the deviceon the ground to at least his waist -all I received was a plastic bag and cardboardseal - NO pole (perhaps it was so advertised -in which event it certainly called INSUFFICIENTattention to THAT factoid ...)
5,Wolf Garten push pull weeder,this is a replacement from an original one that was 27 years old. Superior product that gets alot of use. I did not hesitate to replace it with a new one. Exceptional quality.
5,Wolfgarden shuffle hoe,This garden tool is absolutely the BEST! The quality of Wolf Garten products is unsurpassed. The blade is long-lasting and stays sharp. The aluminum handle is strong but light. Excellent product!
1,Very disappointed,"I bought this tool mainly because of the great reviews, but have been very disappointed with it. I've tried the push pull weeder on dry soil, wet soil, hard soil and soft soil, but have never been able remove more than the top leaves of a weed. It does nothing for any weed with anything more than a shallow root. Either I'm using it wrong or it's only useful for newly sprouted weeds."
2,It doesn't come with a long handle,"I think this looks like it could be a good product, but it came without a handle so I haven't been able to use it yet. I guess I didn't read all of the details, but one of the pictures under the big picture showed a long handle and I assumed it would have a handle. I will order a handle even though I am bothered to have to spend more money, but I would like to try the product. If you order don't forget a handle."
4,Historical novel about Martha Washington,"Marguerite Vance was one of my favorite authors as a child. This book was fun to read, held my interest and was handsomely illustrated with black and white drawings. The people were very vividly drawn."
5,Great Atlas,"Netter is the Man!Netter's hand-painted images are so precise and amazingly beautiful, just like the human body.:o) This is a must have book to use in your anatomy lab and at home. (I suggest you get a used copy to keep in the lab, as it will get very stinky and messy.) The book is well-organized by osteology, muscles and their attachments, and neurovasculature. In comparing Netter's atlas to the actual cadaver, you'll be amazed to see how precise his images really are. Netter is the Michalangelo of the human body."
4,Excellent Atlas A must for anyone taking anatomy,This is a must for anyone that takes anatomy especially first year med students. Almost all pictures are clear and understandable and the author makes use of english names not latin like other atlases.
5,Outstanding even for non-medical readers,"What a wonderful book. I am not a health-care professional -- just a layman -- but this book is positively captivating. I was able to use Dr. Netter's crystal-clear illustrations to understand a shoulder injury, and while there is virtually no descriptive text other than the labelling of the body parts (it's an atlas, not an anatomy book), there is much here to learn from.Every medical professional I've spoken with knows Dr. Frank Netter's work, and it's great that he now has a single volume available to the layman."
5,Indespensible for the medical student,"As a second year medical student, I can say that the prospect of taking an anatomy class without using this book is laughable. This is the most comprehensive, yet accessible anatomic atlas I have ever seen. Every part of the body a student could wish to study has been presented in exhaustive detail, most often in multiple plates offering views from different angles and of different layers. Although excellent, any artistic presentation can only go so far in representing reality, so I would also recommend Rohan and Yakochi's atlas for the photos to prepare for a practical exam - Netter's plates are often too perfect to represent what would be seen in a Cadaver.To sum up, this is the ideal book for any medical student or anyone else who wishes to have a clear, accurate, easy to use atlas of human anatomy."
2,"Sometimes wrong, always difficult to use.","I'm a medical student who entered school with zero background in anatomy. I got Neter's because everyone else did and frankly don't understand all the raving is about. The illustrations are indeed very pretty but what's the point? It takes forever to find the structures in the picture, it's basically impossible to determine anatomical relationships (especially in the difficult areas such as the pelvis, the abdomen and the head) some illustrations are outright wrong, many illustrations are incomplete.I recommend becoming familiar with the anatomical coordinates and learning from accurate and complete texts (Gray's anatomy is available for free online). Moore's Clinical Anatomy is very good for it's clinical correlates, albeit some of the illustrations are subpar."
4,Good book.,This is a good picture book. Full of all kinds of different views of the diagrams. It is a very helpful tool. However there was previous writing and highlighting in the book i purchased and I was not expecting it.
4,Excellent resource,"This was the anatomy atlas that was recommended for my anatomy & physiology course as part of my masters program in speech-language pathology. Obviously, I can't speak for med students but for what we as SLPs need to know, it's excellent. I don't think I opened my A & P text more than once or twice in the course of the semester & haven't since. However, I used Netter repeatedly for not only A & P but also my Neuroanatomy, Aphasia, Dysphagia, and aural habilitation courses. The way that Netter presents the various structures makes them very easy to understand and visualize. Unfortunately, I've lost my original copy over the years and am going to purchase a new one to put in my reference library. I miss not having it to refer to."
5,This Is One of The Best Picture Anatomy Books Out There!,"I Used this book during my first and second term of Anatomy classes at the Swedish Institue Of Massage Therapy in New York City. In April of 2000 I graduated from the school and I am still using this book for studying for my state boards. I do believe this book will be used thoughout the rest of my career as a massage therapist. The picture are wonderful and so real looking, it starts with the bones, bony landmarks, the muscles, tendons, arteries, ligaments, organs ect ect... I would recommend this book to any one that want to explore the human body in a visual Way. [...]"
2,terrible content,"What a waste of money? Like most people, I bought this book for Gross Anatomy because it is so well-known and so pretty. But two weeks into the class, I had to resort to using big Moore and Grant's dissecter for both lectures and labs. This book is so disorganized that it is distracting. You'll be spending 15 min. trying to find the perineal cavity and it's nowhere to be found because the author seems to be more concern with presentation than content. I give this book 2 stars for its beauty but as we all know, asthetic quality doesn't mean squat in medical school."
2,Pretty pictures don't always cut it,"First thoughts upon opening Netter's -- ""wow, this book is gorgeous."" But after the first week of anatomy I was cursing it left and right and ended up relying on Moore's Clinically Oriented Anatomy and Gray's Anatomy for studying.Netter's is full of errors, mislabeled structures, and illustrations that are plain wrong -- seemingly drawn from imagination rather than cadavers. Text Moore's and Gray's don't have as many illustrations but their solid text clears up any confusion far better than a pretty picture."
1,Far too many errors,"I am an anatomy instructor, and I dislike this book with great intensity. Why? Because students seem to love it, and yet it is full of factual errors and mislabeled diagrams. New editions fix old errors, but create new ones. I agree that there are few better atlases for artistic quality -- but when the labels are wrong, what have you gained?Yes, every book that is this densely packed with information will have a few errors in it. This book just seems to have more than its fair share. If you really don't know anything about anatomy, and are trying to learn it for the first time, there are many better books for your money on the market."
4,Decent product for the money,"Have only used it a few times, works like a firepit should I suppose. The black screen rusts quickly - still not sure why a painted surface should rust after being left out once, but whatever - so now it just stays out. Family likes it. The only thing I would prefer is if it had an formed or indented circle inside the copper bowl so the screen stays in place better."
4,A-OK!,"was simple to assemble, looks very sharp, i do like to find items that don't look like everyone elses (ie. the ufo looking pits with ceramic tiles on edge!)--the copper is a classy touch and should age well...we haven't used it yet, but i see that adding sand will add weight and longevity to this product..i think fairly priced since these can range from 75- 300..nice flip screen option ..only con is that edges probably do get hot..but eh..it is a firepit!"
3,They work,"These are what they are and they do work - but one strange thing I have noticed is that these seem much more prone to wandering than previous belts I have used on my sander. They seem to become more stable after they have been mounted for a few days.My shop is cold, so it may be that the fabric in the belt is excessively stiff when cold, and therefore the belt is reluctant to take the set of the pulleys in the sander."
2,100 Grit Sanding Belt,"The sand belt itself isn't so bad, however the glued seam is too thick and causes the wood to bounce. There is definitely a better way to put two ends together. Therefore I dont like it, but it is usable."
5,Excellent book,"I first read this book more than 20 years ago. It goes beyond the sci-fi genre - it's a well thought-out and written book. Each character has so many subtle shadings to them that I find that over the years different aspects of their personalities appeal to me. I don't understand why this book isn't widely considered one of the best sci-fi books ever written. In the 80's after my first copy fell to pieces, this book was so hard to find in the US that I finally tracked it down after a great deal of effort to a UK bookstore. FINALLY it's available in the US again. I bought one from Amazon and may buy another just in case ..."
5,My ALL Time Favorite Book,I read this book the first time more than 20 or so years ago. I still have the original paperback that has been taped and mended. It is one of those kind of books that can be read over and over and each time provokes the imagination. I would recommend this books to anyone who enjoys sci-fi.
5,Floating worlds,"Just recently I decided to create my personal top twenty science fiction and fantasy list spanning over 25 years of reading the genres. Among the inevitable Lord of the Rings, Dune and The Book of the New Sun I had to add ""Floating Worlds"" to the list. Despite reading this little known novel over twenty years ago, the impact of its engaging plot and the richness in the characterization of the hardy heroine Paula left an indelible satisfying impression.One shares a compelling journey with Paula as she survives intense political travails, passionate conflicts and numerous hardships in a vivdly-imagined far-flung future world.I note many of the reviwers articulating their pleasure from this unsung masterpiece. I just wanted to add my voice to their acclaim."
5,Excellent Transaction,This was the only website I could locate the Hanes Thermal Tops and they shipped promptly and were as described. Thanks.
2,YOU CAN'T HANDLE THE FIRE MONSTERS!!!!,"Unfortunately my 2 year old son does love this dvd, I hate it only because of the commentary. You feel like you just came out of basic training after listening to this. ""YOU KIDS GOT WHAT IT TAKE TO BE A FIRE FIGHTER?!!!!"" I kind of cringe everytime I hear this guy, but oh well, little guy loves it."
5,Very good,"It's great made easier for me to sleep on one side while pregnant, specially during the last trimester."
3,not disposable for completists....,"This is not a rip-off dub cd, but rather, an actual long player from the 70's that is part of the king tubby legacy..is it as good as ""prophecy of dub"" or the sides from ""the dub organizer""?..No..but it is hardly disposable for hardcore fans...i don't seem to be as bothered by the sonic quality of a lot of vinyl to digital transfers but it does seem to matter to a lot of people...the occasional crackle doesn't bother me..in fact, i like it!"
1,avoid this cd like the plague,"Tracks seemingly end abruptly and the sound quality is poor, if this cd existed on lp as suggested by a previous reviewer I would recommend finding it in that format."
1,Ripoff!!!,"Beware of bad dub!! This is a dub rip-off album that barely runs 32 minutes and the quality is poor. Don't waste your hard earned money like I did. There are so many other well-mixed and more substantial King Tubby compilations out there, especilly those with Augustus Pablo, that buying this one is shear insanity. Dub record buyers should always be cautious of these rip-offs!"
5,kiss the clown rocks,"Hi my name is Travis Trapane the lead singers nephew. I love this band I am so proud of kerry porter and the rest of the band they have and are doing an excellent job on all there albums I would like them to keep in touch and i would like to be posted on any up comming events with kiss the clown.

1,Support for WebObjects is removed with Mac OS X Server v10.6.,I found this in the Mac OSX Server Upgrading and Migration PDF that is available on the Apple website. See page 5.
4,Good reference book for heavy Excel users,A very good book to have on the desk for those of you who use Excel extensively and might utilize some uncommon formulas and/or functions to save time.
3,Typical Inside Outside book,No surprises with this book. Like all its other predecessors. Nice it came out fast after Office 07 came out.
5,Run for the Roses: Become a Spreadsheet Jockey,"Don't guess, don't waste time with the MS Help's Office Assistant, and don't Google it. Buy an Excel reference book and learn to do it right. I own this one, The Excel Bible, and Excel Formulas 2003. Any one of them will do, but owning multiple is overkill. The book comes with a searchable .pdf version that I keep on my laptop and use regularly. By picking up the hardcopy from my bookshelf once a week, I've really streamlined my spreadsheet building process. Were you once an Arts & Crafts type of person and are trying to morph into a quant guru? I was. I am...... still working on it. Buy the book. -Sly"
1,Disappointed,"This book doesn't appear to have been well proof read. I have found numerous figures (screen shots) in the first few chapters of the book that are in the wrong place. Also, the code sample on p173 does not actually calculate the correct averages it sets out to do i.e. sglTotal = sglTotal + rgeMonth(intWeek, intHours) does not work as proposed.These frustrating errors combined with a lack of syntax examples and code shown without reference (some of the time) to the underlying examples makes this book tough going. The book also assumes an already strong understanding of VBA which was ok for me, but limits the potential audience, so beginners beware."
2,Low Budget Greatest Hits Album!!!!,This is another greatest hits album from Rare Earth. Has the short version of Get Ready but no long version--which is better. Has both the long and short version of Ma--they should have left off the long version of Ma and put the long version of Get Ready--would have been a better album. The cd is ok but there are no notes on the band or names of band members but they are the original band. There are other versions of the Best of Rare Earth around that are far better. Fans should avoid this one--no info on the band --nothing--just 11 songs--no linear notes--what a rip!!! Avoid this one!!
4,"Great fun, and well read.","I picked this up as something I could listen to while I was driving, and I was glad before ten minutes had passed; not only is the story enjoyable, but the reader does an excellent job at keeping the listener aware of who's saying what. I laughed out loud while listening to this jocular book, and I endorse it."
4,Good froth.,"The McNally novels are my idea of simple frothy fun. Archy is an endearing fickle bonehead and this is one of his more developed adventures.In this book (the third McNally novel), Archy is hired by a worried mama to vet a future daughter-in-law. Vet her he does, in his own inimitable way. It is only with reluctance (and in the face of several connected murders) that Archy has to admit that Theodosia Johnson is not exactly what she seems and that the overprotective parent may have a point...Don't read these for literature. Don't read them for their hard-hitting investigation of the lives of the rich in Palm Springs. Read them for the fashion and the puns and for the pleasure of a thoroughly annoying detective who still has enough Cary Grant in him to carry a book."
2,ok ... but is very short,"I bought two of these shirts and love the fact that they are not two-layered. The zipper is a good idea in theory, but it is somewhat visible and it ""curls"" (for a lack of a better word here) after putting it in the dryer. The shirt runs very small and short! I don't know about other moms ... but i don't want a shirt that ends at my belly button, especially not after giving birth. I ended up using it at home only."
3,"Pretty, Functional, Runs Short","This is a great shirt - the openings are terrific for breastfeeding. This shirt runs short, so order the next size larger...."
5,Functional and goodlookingl,"I use this shirt a lot and am planning to order two more directly from nursingmamas site - amazon has a smaller colr/size selection. It looks a bit bulky where the zipper is and the metal part can get next to baby's face when closed, otherwise it is perfect and also has a perfect shape to conseal my after twin pregnancy belly.I would recommend this shirt for the ease of nursing - I tandem nurse my twins, so should be very conveinient for nursing one baby."
3,Falls off tracks.,"Top and bottom drawers stay in nicely, but the ones in the middle tend to fall off the tracks. It needs a supporting bar somewhere in the middle to keep this from happening."
4,Great storage!!!,"I teach 5th grade and this is the best organizer to have near my desk. I have each drawer labeled. It is handy to have everything that you use regularly right next to you. Also, I like the colorful look, compliments my classroom well!"
4,"Outstanding book, at a reasonable price.","Creative writing of history as the author lived it, easy read, an intertaining at the same time, a famous actor whom left the safety of Hollywood, put his life on the line for our country during the dark days of World War II. One has to admire the man as you read thru his book."
2,My heart is breaking,"I have loved Kiske's vocals since Keeper Part 1. In fact, he was my favorite metal singer. I love his guest appearances on Gamma Ray's Land of the Free and Masterplan's Heroes. Instant Clarity had a couple of good songs on it and that was followed by the horrendous Readiness to Sacrifice. Unfortunately, this follows in the wake of R.T.S. and is almost as bad.For some reason, when Michael sings metal his voice is awesome, but when he sings rock his voice sounds whiny and annoying. I found the vocals on this album terribly irritating, almost out of tune, and practically unlistenable. Not that I'm suggesting that Michael go back to metal - he's way beyond that - but it seems he's lost his ability to write a good tune (actually he lost that somewhere before R.T.S.). There is nothing memorable on this album. A couple of the better songs are Let's Be Heroes, Boiling Point of No Return, and Turn It. He Pretends makes me want to vomit.You can skip this one."
1,DISAPOINTING,"When i heard this cd i tought that the great Michael Kiske was going to make a great come back to the Heavy Metal bussines, area that made him famous and worshiped by many, but instead I belived that I was listening to a Michael Jackson cd. Kiske has a great voice and many fans all over the world, so why does'nt he make us happy and make a metal record? Metal fans,this is not what you are looking for!!!!!!!!!!!!!"
5,Ooh what a sexy man!,I love kiske and I always dream about me and kiske making love in the forest of nature hearing ourselves trembling together while taking turns jerking eachother off while were taking a dump together ooh yeah.You see me and kiske were meant to be together and I wanna marry him!Ooh sexy man!!!
3,intresting sniper game,"i think this game is o.k. it's certainly not as fun as playing it in the arcade with a giant sniperrifle with a t.v. screen in the ""scope"". the game is extremely hard because it's hard to make the right shot with a really sensitive joystick.the gameplay is not all to good becaus there is only like 2 paths to choose besides training. some parts of the storyline are also pretty lame. who would sneak into a mansion using a sniper rifle to take down your enemies? a little bit fun to see how far your friends can get into the game but without the ""quarters"" like the arcade it's impossible to get to the end. good graphics, but not enough game. i hate to bash a video game, so i won't. The game is fun to wath with your friends, but there isn't to much to do in the game itself. please click whether this info was useful or not. thanks."
4,"Good Game, but...","I have played Silent Scope a little bit, and I enjoy the graphics and the different senarios. One of the main reasons why I purchased the game was so that I had another game in which to use my light gun on (besides House of the Dead 2 which is a great game with the light gun), but I found out that the light gun doesn't work with the game. I was very disappointed. I was mislead into thinking that this first person shooter would allow me to use the gun, but it does not. Maybe it is the gun (but it works fine on HOTD2), I am not sure. I would be interested in hearing if other people had the same problem."
4,Budget hits has all you need,Gin Blossoms / The best of / The Millennium Collection: This budget CD has the 12 songs everyone wants from The Gin Blossoms and they sound excellent here. This is a nice Four Star hits CD
2,Not Good!!! Come On!!!,"This one is just an excuse to make money... has music from 2 CD's and one other, none from their - excellent - last CD. I mean, Gin Blossoms is a great group, but this specific item offers absolutely nothing new or different, again, it's just an excuse... I give it 2 stars 'cause this guys know music, not because of the whole thing."
1,I am absolutely appalled to discover that Sanders did not wr,"After several put-down-the-book-and-groan moments because the writing was so unlike Sanders' style, I discovered that the book was written by a ghostwriter. I want my money back! The series can continue, however, the real author's name should be on the cover. I feel duped by Putnam."
1,"""One does not attempt to copy Sander's.......Do One...!""","Plz....Vincent..you have butchered the McNally's...even Hobo! .....there is no style, charm, nor remote link to Archy' panache'.... Readers beware....this is in no way close as to what you might desire from L. Sanders.....This gentleman (current author) is not a part of our, ""PBR""....his copy attempt is a, ""PBF:...poor.Tis a sad day,....our McNally friends (even Hobo), have passed with their master....Rest in Peace."
1,Lawrence Sanders must be turning in his grave over this!,"I was so excited when I found out there was a new McNally book, after all it had been 2 years. Like many others I was dismayed at the term 'was' on the book jacket and delved into the copyright page to discover that it was not written by Mr. Sanders. Mr. Lardo's poor attempt at becoming Archy McNally is extremely disappointing. He tries very hard to write just like Mr. Sanders and he fails miserably. I am struggling through the book to see ""who done it"", but will be putting it on the book shelf permanently, never to be read again!"
3,"Where's the ""real"" Archie??","I read the disclaimer that this was not a ""real"" Lawrence Sanders, but had to see what Archie was up to anyway. However, the disappointment was that Archie only ate hamburger at the Pelican Club? I think not! His clothes had changed? Wow! Did he get engaged to Connie? Can you imagine? I do not remember a sister who came to visit at Christmas. Am I crazy?? And, the most disturbing was that pater had had an affair. That made him less than perfect (for one who only reads Dickens) and necessary for Archie's character to develop. I was disappointed, but still love Archie and the way he solves crimes. No, this is not a classic, but still an enjoyable read. But, Vincent Largo ought to write his own books as he is a capable writer."
3,"Did Lardo ever read a McNally book ? One never knows, do one","Archy's back but boy, has he changed ! Lardo's got him swilling suds (what happened to Mr. Pettibone's exotic drinks?) wearing jeans and (oh my goodness !!!) a business suit. Somehow, Archy got engaged to Connie. The publisher's roped me in too, by putting Sander's name on the book but this is definitely not the Archy we know and love. (Didn't the pater seem a little chatty?) Yet, if you miss Archy, this book will give you a quick fix."
4,Excellent . . . for a McNally Yarn,"I read the copyright page before I bought the book: and read the first few pages. Let's face it, the Archie McNally series isn't great literature, it's the literary equivalent of comfort food, and this volume delivers exactly that. Indeed, it recalled Sanders' earlier Archie, and I enjoyed it immensely and hope to see more. What would summer reading be without Archie McNally?"
4,Very delightful read,"I thought this ""last"" McNally book of Lawrence Sanders was very delightful and entertaining. When I realized it was written by Vincent Lardo, I was happy to know that possibly ""Archy"" will continue to entertain me. I think in all respect to L. Sanders, the true author of future McNally books should use his own name, possibly mentioning the character was created by Mr. Sanders. Hopefully, faithful readers will keep an open mind and enjoy the future stories."
2,predictable,"I first thought that Lawrence Sanders had one last manuscript in him before his passing - and this was it. Then I read the inside page and found out a Lawrence Sanders ""clone"" had ghost written this book. This wouldn't have been so terrible (and has been done before) if the publishers hadn't tried to pawn it off as a Sanders book. Obviously greed played a key role here. The book itself wasn't that bad and was written in the same vein as others in the series. I just resent the way it was presented."
3,"It is ghost written but it is not too bad, and improves","I knew that Lawrence Sanders had passed away, but I was curious about the fate of the McNally series. At the end of twenty pages I was utterly convinced that the Sander's estate had made a terrible choice to ghost write this series. By the end of the book Mr. Lardo had gotten better. He had quit trying to be too cute and began to concetrate on the story. There are several twists and turns in the plot, and I must say that I enjoyed the book. If the series continues I would buy the next episode. I think this book rates 31/2 stars, but not 4 stars."
1,This book is a rip-off.,"I knew something was wrong before I had read two chapters of this book. Then I happened to read the fine print disclaimer under the copyright and discovered it was not the work of Lawrence Sanders, but some wanna-be hired by the Sanders estate. What ever happened to truth in advertising?My wife and I were both Sanders fans and will certainly miss his writing. We will also refuse to buy any more books from C.P. Putnam's Sons."
1,Any Archie fan would know this is NOT an original Archie!,"Don't waste your money!I have read all of the Archie novels for fun and relaxation, and had hoped that this last one was left before Sanders died. Shame on me for being naive. As an English teacher, I enjoyed Archie's depth of character development within the confines of usually predictable plots. However, the very first page of this fake Sanders' book makes it obviously unARCHIE. I could not even force myself to read the pitiful prose and finish the book. I am mad that the publisher tried to trick the public by putting Sanders' name on the jacket. There is NO WAY this is the real thing. If my students tried to pass their work off as someone else's, I would give them an F for plagiarism! For those responsible for this faux McNally, I give them an F, too! The real dilemma is that the publisher is without Sanders, and the fans are without Archie. This is truly a no-win situation. An Archie fan"
1,"Not bad, but ...","This is not a bad book, but it is not worthy of Lawrence Sanders' name or to have been published in the McNally series. Mr. Lardo may be able to write an entertaining novel, but this is not it. He strains so hard to duplicate Lawrence Sanders that he constantly takes away from his story. Hopefully, this will be the last of the McNally series and the last poor-copy of Mr. Sanders who brought a uniqueness and freshness to his writing. I shall miss Mr. Sanders. I enjoyed everything he wrote."
1,Lousy - Please Get Better,"Read and loved the whole series as written by Sanders. I thought with Lardo's second effort (I think) we'de see a lot more progress on his writing. I liked seeing another famous Sanders character named Delaney show up in this book. So far, Lardo hasn't made the cut. PLEASE take it seriously and give it another shot - I'll give you one more as well."
3,Archy has seen better days,"I tried to ignore the fact that Lawrence Sanders didn't write this book, but couldn't. Something was missing. This episode in the McNally series has a little more of the conventional mystery element to it, but regretfully less of the Archy characteristic flair. If you want a decent mystery, you will probably like this book, but if you are looking for more of the ""Archy, have you been behaving yourself?"", ""No, have you?"", ""Of course not,"" humor, several of the previous books in the series are much better, my favorites being McNally's Luck and McNally's Puzzle."
5,"Not Lawrence Sanders, but still enjoyable ...","I knew Lawrence Sanders had passed away and expected that Archy McNally had died with him. Needless to say, I was extremely excited when I found McNally's Dilemma penned by Vincent Lardo. From the first chapter you can definitely sense this is not the same Archy McNally. I sensed that Archy McNally had developed a mean streak after his many dealings with the Palm Beach underworld. However after continuing on, we are again exposed to our loved Archy McNally, his enjoyable meals, his eloquent speech,and his constant philandering! True fans of Lawrence Sanders will enjoy the book, especially since many who knew of his death did not expect to ever again join Archy McNally in another adventure."
2,Ghostwriter not up to Sanders style!,"The ghostwriting style exhibited in McNally's Dilemma does not do well for the flowing prose of Lawrence Sanders. The book publisher, Putnam, has duped the faithful followers of Archy and his ""discreet inquiries"" of Palm Beach. But of course as one who was duped-""one never knows, do one?"""
2,An Archie Fix????,A quick fix to a less than exicting book. A good try but not the same. Too many changes in Archie and his father to please me. Plus a sister! Where did she come from. Just knowing Sanders didn't write this made the whole book hard to finish.
2,"Will continue to read the series, but ....","I agree with the earlier reviewers who knew right away that Lawrence Sanders had not written this novel. There were several obvious errors in the first half of the novel which he never would have made. Fortunately for the publisher, I enjoy reading of Archy and his friends/family so I will probably purchase future books. Lawrence Sanders, you were a treasure!"
2,Putnam's Dilemma,"The real dilemma was whether or not Putnam should have published this book under Sanders name. As it did not do either Sanders or McNally justice, my vote is no. Allow both to rest in peace."
2,A caricature of the original Archy McNally,"It is only by reading the fine print that one learns Lawrence Sanders did not write this book, and it is evident that Archy McNally shall always remain the sole creation of Mr. Sanders. While the attempt is interesting, it misses the mark in many of Archy's more subtle characteristics. For the first time, it was clear how the end would evolve, another indication that Lawrence Sanders did not write this book. But it almost seemed like trickery to keep that fact so hidden, and indeed a total disservice to the legacy of Lawrence Sanders."
3,pretty good and sometimes change is good,"no-this isn't the real sanders writing this book, I got over that fact and still read it, i enjoyed it very much -as for the previous reviewers yes, his father had an affair and yes, he bought connie a ring- The new archy kinda made me mad because of the descriptions weren't so vivid but i will get over it and buy the next one -hopefully there will be another mcnally book"
1,"Disappointing, at best",I am an avid reader of the McNally series and I was as overjoyed as any that it would continue after Sander's passing. Unfortunatly after reading this tomb I must say that it would have been better to die with the author. Lardo does not possess any of the charm that made Sander's character so endearing and lovable. The quick wit and intelligence I always assocated with Archy was truly lacking leaving little more than a one dementional character.
3,Not the real Archy,"While the plotting of the latest edition of Archy's adventures closely matches the previous novels, I knew well before reading the jacket cover that Lawrence Sanders was not the writer. True, I should have looked at the jacket cover first; however, I would have read it anyway. I always anticipate the latest McNally book.The Archy in this novel isn't nearly as charming or endearing as in previous ones. He often boarders on being uncivil, and, even when dealing with the lowest of skum, this isn't something Sanders' Archy would ever do. The dialogue between the various characters isn't nearly as snappy as Mr. Sanders' writing. In addition, the way the ghost writer characterizes Archy's father and household staff don't really bear much in common with Sanders' creations.Good book, though, despite all of the above. The plotting certainly equals previous McNally books. I just miss the light touch that Lawrence Sanders brought to the extremely likable Archy McNally."
3,Who are you and what did you do with Archie?,"The character answers to Archie, he lives with the senior McNally and his lovely ""I love those begonias"" wife, still goes to the Pelican Club and Ms Connie (The Lady Horowitz social secretary) is still the long suffering love interest--most of the time--in his life. But, somehow the spark is gone, the glib, gutsy, dialogue is flat and strained. Archie fans can tell the difference. New readers may well fall in favor with the Junior McNally in ""Dilemma"", but as a 25 year reader of Lawrence Sanders every work, Archie has always been a light side against the dark side of the ""Sins"" and ""Commandments"" books. But this Archie is an imposter. One never knows, do one. One of my favorite characters has expired with Mr. Sanders. I grieve both their passings. Good night Archie, you were exceptional."
2,Nothing like the original,"If you're not a fan of Lawrence Sanders and haven't read his previous works, this work will strike you as somewhat entertaining. If you don't read the fine print, and miss the fact that this is an effort commissioned by the publisher and estate of the late author, you'll think this is Sanders' last book and his worst effort. I resent the fact that you have to delve so far into the fine print in the frontmatter to find all this out. I see why Amazon has discounted the price so deeply. Frankly, even at the discounted price, it wasn't worth the expense or the effort."
1,Ghost writer writes ghastly novel,"At first, I couldn't quite put my finger on what was wrong with this book, but I knew it was not right. After a couple of chapters, I thought to check the back of the title page. Well, there's the answer. It was not written by Lawrence Sanders. The publisher and estate of the late, great Mr. Sanders have greedily allowed a hack to write a novel using Mr. Sanders characters. Unfortunately, the writer, Vincent Lardo, does not possess any of Mr. Sanders wit or erudition, nor does he have a clue as to the genius it takes to write at Mr. Sanders level. I gave this book one star only because zero stars was not an option. Shame on you, heirs of Lawrence Sanders. I hope you choke on every dollar you make from this sham."
3,Good,It wasn't as good as the other McNally Series. I will truly miss Lawrence Sanders. But Vincent Lardo makes an admirable job of keeping McNally alive. Despite my trying to find fault with book . It was good. I look forward to future McNally books Mr. Lardo.
3,A worthy addition to the Archey McNally's adventures.,"I've read Sherlock Holmes, Dracula, Conan and plenty of other storys by follow-on authors after the original author joined the angels. I liked them, usually, and I liked the latest McNally's. If you are one of those who can only tolerate the originals, then this is not for you, but the rest of us will like it. One problem: there is an error in the book which any half-compentant cororner or the redoubtable Sgt Rogoff could never have made, unless the fix was in. The book lost a star because of it. It does not really take away from the enjoyment though. Long live Archey."
5,"I know it's not Mr. Sanders, but I enjoyed it very much.","I enjoyed the latest McNally adventure. I am fully aware that Mr. Sanders did not write this book. I thought the style, character, flavor, and sense was Archy McNally as I have enjoyed him in all his other romps.Thanks for at least being able to keep Archy alive."
1,"I hate to but in yet, but...","Just saw the notice of the new book in today's LA Times. Shocked, knowing Sanders had died. Will read it though. Deserves a chance. I'm just popping in to say that I do recall the mention of a sister in an earlier book. And I do think a Christmas visit was mentioned."
1,disappointed,I was so pleased that Sanders had written one last McNally caper before his death. Two chapters into the book I realized something was not quite right; Archie was not quite Archie. It was then I discovered that the book had not been written by Sanders. I won't read another.
2,mcnally's Dilemma,"I am a new reader to Mr. Sanders and loved all the Mcnally series! Alas Mcnally's Dilemma was a great disappointment. Not only was the trivia portion overplayed, but some were not accurate!! Too much was wasted on trivia and the clothes worn by the characters. It was a poor substitute for the real thing!!"
3,fun but no Sanders...,"Though the characters from the Sanders series exist in this book, they are in no way as entertaining as those written by Sanders himself. Unfortunately, Lardo, by continuing the McNally legacy, is forced into a bind. That is, he is forced to imitate a ""Sander-esque"" style, a prose that I find smooth and witty - an Elmore Leonard with a little more panache. Lardo falls a bit short and some of his attempts produced a grimace rather than a smile.This novel fits well in a carry on and will provide some distraction on a long flight or drive... much like a Time magazine from a few months ago."
3,NOT QUITE SAUNDERS,"I bought this book not knowing that Saunders had died however felt something lacking as I went along. So looked it up with Amazon and now I know what is wrong with the wonderful ""Archy"". He is not as funny and flamboyant as in the past -- ok but no cigar! Haven't finished the book yet but find no mention of the fact that Archy is beautifully attired except no sox. For some reason I found that amusing. Maybe as I hate to wear sox myself and don't once the weather goes about 55 degrees. Also his Father is not quite as crusty and mother is not so ditsy. Maybe our new author will reread some of the past books and pick up more of Archy's funny ways."
3,Enjoyed the book but feel deceived.,"I was delighted to see that Lawrence Sanders had completed one last Archy novel before his death--or so I believed. I did not see the author notation ""hidden"" on the copywrite page, a fact I discovered later from an article in the WASHINGTON POST. While reading the book and enjoying it, I knew something was wrong: the conversations just didn't seem as sharp, as pithy--something I dismissed at the time as a result of Sander's advancing age. I resent that the author was obviously trying to put something over on the innocent reader and, in my case, succeeded. I award this book three stars instead of five I gave the other Archy books."
2,Disappointing,"I've loved the McNally series and eagerly looked forward to reading McNally's Dilemma. I found the story to be boring. I thought Vincent Lardo did a fine job capturing the spirit of Archy and the usual characters, but the story just didn't do it for me."
1,Lawrence Sanders rolls over in his grave...,"While I knew going in that this book was not written by Mr. Sanders, I had high expectations since Mr. Lardo was chosen by the Sanders estate and it was written in ""the Sanders style."" NOT EVEN CLOSE.The plot line, prose, and even the characters themselves were trite, simple, and poorly written.This must have been the Sanders Estate way of raising money to pay estate taxes.I am glad I borrowed this book from the Public Library and did not buy it"
2,McNally's lost his wit,"Sorry, but without Sanders special wit, Arch is too flat... what happened to his pre and post prandrial drinks? - loved those words - his making up with Connie whenever he was bad? - his having to bribe the housekeeper and her husband to get him info? - Vincent you gave it your best shot but this one just doesn't have the cutting edge or drag you into Palm Beach society the way Lawrence used to ...Lawrence's descriptions of Palm Beach and south Florida in general were so good you felt as if you were there, especially for those who are familiar with the local. I'd really hate to see Archy go but it might be time to marry him off on Connie and move him somewhere else and start over where his eccentricities can evolve.."
3,It's not that bad,"This book is a little off, as others have noted, but is still a worthy effort. I was amazed to find Archy seriously pondering the ultimate commitment of Holy Matrimony. mmm, I don't think so..not unless Connie is willing to move into the 3rd floor with him! Like other folks, I did guess the killer very early. My love for Archy is so great and boundless that I will continue to follow his adventures, but Lawrence, we miss ya very much."
2,Not the REAL THING,"Most of the McNally books took me a day or two to read because they were so funny. Archy McNally is such a great character! I love the use of words in the McNally books. However, this book took me about 1 1/2 weeks to read because it just didn't have the ""zing"" of the REAL McNally books. Something was missing from page one on.The story was OK, but I think I would have enjoyed it a lot more if I didn't feel like I was ""tricked"" into thinking Lawrence Sanders had written it. It just doesn't seem fair that the heirs can put his name on a book that was not written by the great Lawrence Sanders. What they have done is just short of fraud. Maybe next some great actors can pay someone to act ""just like them"" in a movie they can't do, Vincent van Gogh's family can pay someone to paint ""just like him"", and John Denver's heirs can pin his famous name on a new album of songs that sound somewhat like his."
2,Really hard pictures,"As always hapeens with Sebastiao Salgado, you can see really good pictures in this book, but they are really hard pictures and sometimes it's difficult to see this book. It shows the reality of Sahel, which is forgotten by occidental people and this book makes to think about it."
4,Supercool with a refreshingly hard edge...,"Drawing on three decades of jazz playing, Belgian born keyboardist Marc Moulin produces a funky mix of acid-jazz back beats, rolling organ & guitar licks and (thankfully sparse) electronically enhanced vocals, pushed well above the ""comfortably pleasant"" zone by strong compositions, clever arrangements and effortlessly tight musicianship (including some excellent sax & trumpet breaks) that give virtually all of the tracks the hard edge needed to draw you back for more. Similar to Saint Germain's ""Tourist"" but with a much stronger pure jazz feel, the album flows from start to finish and, while a couple of tracks come dangerously close, avoids falling into the boringly lush waters of ""hotel lobby background music"" that engulf too many of his contemporaries. Supercool, interesting & fun - a rare combination indeed!"
3,Slippery slope,"I first heard the track ""Organ"" on a progressive (college) radio station while working Montreal. Very hooky groove, a bit trippy. Called the station, DJ had left, no playlist available. Then, as luck would have it, I heard it again on Radio Paradise (an Internet ""radio station""), which, of course, posted the playlist online.Short, inventive solos by the featured artists (among them Philip Catherine on electric guitar)cascade over tasteful yet solid rhythms. Vocalist Christa adds some cool refrains but Moulin features her singing more as a rhytmic instrument.Highlights are ""Into the Dark"", ""What"" and the afore-mentioned ""Organ"". Call it what you will, but like all well-produced, well-performed cuts, these should find a place on your shelf (or I-POD)to be played when the mood suits the music."
4,VERY GOOD COPY,"MARC DOESN'T HAVE A VERY WELL DEFINED STYLE, IST SOUNDS, JAZZY, A LITTLE ELECTRONIC, BUT IF YOU DON'T PUT HIM IN THE SAME CONTEXT, OF SAINT GERMAIN, KEVIN YOST, OR KOOP, YOU REALLY WILL ENJOY IT, TAKE IT AS IT COMES."
1,boring!,"I got the remixes of this (excellent remixes especially by La Malice) but this is boring , it's not jazz ,not electro.it's just really boring."
2,"it's not jazz, it's not electro","This is disappointing.It's not real Jazz, it's not electronic music too.It's a kind of mixture,and for people who may like Telex and thing this could resemble Telex in any way, don't waste your time."
4,Bavaria in Arkansas,"Marianne Sagebrecht is brilliant in this comedy about living beyond one's means. Dated, yes, but hilarious, and Brad Davis was hot as ever. Judge Reinhold is great as the parish priest."
5,Berroguetto según Marcelo Calí,"Un increible CD con gran calidad sonora y una instrumentación cuidada e interesante. En el se fusionan aires de música gallega con influencias celtas, logrando una combinación atrapante y con una fuerte personalidad. Recomiendo este segundo CD de Berroguetto que ha logrado transformarse en un gran trabajo de este grupo español."
5,JusT GrEaT !,"Galician people play modern music with their folk sounds (celtic). These people are from the north of Spain, and I just can say buy this boom cd you'd love it. !beatiful songs¡"
4,Collective Reminder,"You cannot fault the information given, it is in the usual style of Edward De Bono,there are reminders from previous written works also some additional information. It is very easy to read and take on board all he has to say. If your familiar with his work you will feel at home, if your new to De Bono, you would find it best to refer to previous works in the first instance other wise you will not gain all that is intended as there are sometimes only references and not all the detailed information you might require."
1,Both original and good,The part that is good is not original and the part that is original is not good.
3,for absolute completists,"This cd has only 3 tracks, all recent live versions of ""Drunk"", ""Always on my mind"", and ""Being boring"". The performances are fine, but this is really only of interest to collectors."
2,not overly impressed,"I bought this remote for my sons TV. The tv has been around since I was a teenager and the on/off button is starting to act up and with the orginal remote long since lost I thought a remote might help save the tv some lifespan. I programmed it to work the TV and the dvd player. The process was very simple... but the results not so good. You can't access the TV menu without it interfering with the dvd menu and then it simply wont shut the menu screen off unless you turn the TV off. It'll do it's job of saving the on/off button on the TV, but for anything other than that, it's just annoying."
5,Mighty Sam .......You are the MAN,Mighty Sam you are the man.Sound Quality on this recording is to die for both vinyl and CD......OUTSTANDING!!!!!Hammond Organ is terrrrrrific!!!!!!!!Mighty Sam is Mighty Strong and smooth!!!!!!Blues but not boring blues!!!!!!KILLER 1st class recording and first class performance.I need to have a quality recording to go with a quality performance and you get BOTH!!!!!
2,Poor Sound....,"The other reviewers seem very satisfied with the sound quality of this ocarina, so perhaps mine was simply defective, but I found the sound very disappointing. It was faint and breathy, and required much effort and even more luck to find just the right angle to get anything resembling a clear tone out of it. Returned it, and found a new one that works much better."
1,Childs play toy,If your looking for something to use as decoration or to give as a toy to your child.. Go ahead and buy it. But if your really interested in learning to play the ocarina save your money.
3,too small,"I bought this for my boyfriend and it turned out too small. If you have a larger-than-average head, beware. It doesn't stretch much, either."
4,"Good, not great","I needed a driver's cap for a costume event. This one worked, but paled in both quality and looks compared to real, vintage caps. However, the price was far less so it was perfect for a one-time use."
5,From high-profile forensics cases,"Dr. Cyril Wecht is one of the most sought-after forensic pathologists in the world: his expertise lends to providing proof that runs counter to popular opinion and his scientific expertise reads well for lay readers fascinated by true crime investigations. TALES FROM THE MORGUE: FORENSIC ANSWERS TO NINE FAMOUS CASES tackles high-profile cases from Scott Peterson's murder of his wife and unborn child to the assassination of President Kennedy and the death of Marilyn Monroe. Dr. Wecht reveals methods, evidence, trials, and pathology techniques in a lively discourse which reads like a thrilling murder mystery of nine famous cases. Fascinating reading and a lively writing style lend to TALES FROM THE MORGUE 's appeal to a wide general-interest audience."
1,Tales from the Morgue: Forensic Answers to Nine Famous Cases......,"I agree with the previous reviewer. Don't waste your time. There's nothing new, except maybe the information on the Kennedy case. I feel the author is capitalizing on the popularity of the forensic-type television programs, and I got sucked in. And now that I know more about Dr. Wecht from the news, my thoughts have been confirmed."
1,Don't bother with this book,"As usual, Dr. Wecht (who, by the way, is under federal investigation for using his public office for private personal gain) makes the reader believe he had official roles in all these cases. In fact, in most of them he has been working for tabloids such as The National Enquirer and The Globe, and has not had any official role.It has been many years since any reputable law enforcement entity outside of the Pittsburgh area (where they have to use him) has asked for the Dr.'s assistance on a case, and his involvement in recent cases has just been to spout off in order to make the cases sound more lurid -- and thus profitable -- to the tabloid media.Save your money and don't buy this book. Use it instead to buy a front-row ticket to his upcoming (hopefully) federal trial."
3,boring and dry,"i felt this book was really boring and uninformative. it was required for a class, and i bought a new one, becasue it just didnt describe things in an engaging manner."
1,A lawyer's biggest errors,"Every lawyer knows better than to simply say what they think, give an opinion, or offer unfounded advice. ""Don't tell me what you THINK, tell me the LAW!"" This book makes that error on a regular basis. You'll get lots of information on how to write and present arguments, but none of it is actually founded on anything. Indeed, much of it flies in the face of what psychology has told us of the effects of primacy and recency. Another lawyer's error that simply underscores how baseless this book is? No citations."
1,unversal confusion,"This remote I THOUGHT was the same one I had bought at walmart for about the same price....boy was I wrong! The programming instructions are EXTREMELY confusing and dont even seem to be the correct instuctions for this remote. To make a long story, this POS went to the garbage and I bought a 5 dollar remote from Walmart and it works easily and a child could program it......DO NOT BUY THIS REMOTE!!!!!"
1,Remote could not find a single one of my devices,"I'm not sure if I'm being entirely fair giving only 1 star, considering I never really got to see the remote in action. However, considering I bought this universal remote to universally control my devices, I do think it utterly failed in that regard since it could not find a single one of them. I would have considered it acceptable if it had at least managed to control the RCA device for which I do not have a remote control, but it could not even find a device of the same brand as the remote. I will be returning this."
2,Universal Remote,My tv is an older tv/ vcr combo. I finally found tbe right setting but it would not remember it and I had to redo it . I gave up on this one.
4,RF transmitter does not work,"This remote works well in IR mode, but I cannot get it to work with an RF transmitter battery which works well with my Philips. Otherwise 5 stars."
2,no button for captions/subtitles,"There is no button to turn captioning on/off and no mention of this in the ""user manual"", which is not so much a manual as a list of instructions on how to get it set up--that's it. In order to get your questions answered by RCA you have to create an online account. Buttons are very small and don't always respond the first time you press them. I am returning this item to Radio Shack."
1,Not compatible,Did not work on my BluRay player which it advertised compatibility with. It is what we bought it for so we were really disappointed.
2,half n half,some of the functions on my dvd player are not responding as they should apart from this its a good enough remote for the price
3,S'OK,"This is a perfectly OK remote control, but what I was looking for was a remote that easily allows for digital channels, i.e. has a button that inserts a decimal point to jump to channel 12.1, 12.2, 12.3... I thought I understood from the instructions that this remote provided that, but I haven't been able to get such a function to work. On the other hand, I find it easier to jump to auxiliary devices with the RCA than with my other replacement remote.The dogs actually chewed up the remote that came with my Phillips, and ever since we've been channel surfing more than I'd prefer. This hasn't resolved that problem. Otherwise it's ok as a multi-device controller."
4,Works as described,"Overall, I am quite satisfied with this remote. My only complaint is that the broadcast range seems a little limited and the keys are not as sensitive as I would like. I often have to press the buttons two or three times. I have not determined whether this is a result of the poor broadcast range or insensitive keys. I like the macro feature but it is a little slow."
2,Not recommendable,"This works ok for my TV, but forget about using it for multiple units if you want any decent functionality. Granted, the play, stop, pause, forward and backward (chapter and scan) work for my DVD player (also an RCA-so you think there would be no compatibility issues), but maneuvering around on the DVD title screen is not very user friendly. To do this, you need to use the numbers and line them up with the order of the options on the screen. But here's the catch, sometimes you need to start with ""0"", and sometimes ""1"" on the remote. It's just a big pain, and it takes experimentation to figure it out. So if you like to watch bonus features, use subtitles or chapter selection, don't waste your time with this remote, it's just not designed well."
4,good so far,"Only had it for a couple of days - but for the money, it's the best universal remote I have found so far.I am only using it for my television - so I can't speak as to how well it works for multiple units."
4,not for AV receivers,"This worked almost too well for my LG Bluray player and Emerson TV, but neither the instructions nor forum offers suggestions for controlling my Yamaha receiver..There's 4 ways to program this remote; all of them are detailed well in the instructions. the instructions to offer codes by brand and model (ie LG-Bluray, LG-TV) You can also program the unused buttons to control different devices than what the mfg programmed, so my unused DVR button can be set to control a second DVD player/VCR. Really like this remote. What I have noticed in the 30 minutes I've used it is that the LED background light only lights up an unusually shaped portion on the buttons. Get this to work with my receiver and it'd be a 5 star item."
2,Bad Quality,"The shoe looks better than in the photograph, but the quality is really bad. It got torn in just 3 months."
2,"Great play, awful translation","Well, I can't fault the quality of ""Tartuffe"" itself. It's a charming, well-written play that still holds up after the passings of time. Also, the inclusion of the French and English absolutely corresponding to each other does make this a decent French teaching aid.However, the translation is sorely lacking. There is no attempt to make any sort of verse translation, resulting in a flat, uninspired prose work. Beyond that, however, much of the phrasing is awkward and stilted. It seems to be faithful to the French original, but a great deal is lost when the only aim is to provide a literal rendering.In short, this book is more useful for stimulating the appetite for the much better Richard Wilbur translation. This edition may serve its purpose as a teaching tool, but it is a less than impressive read on its own."
1,What happened?,"An excited fan, I ordered this CD. Unfortuantley I never received it because the place I ordered from claimed a misprint on the price. So here I sit with out. Sadnes."
5,interesting selection of tracks and great Beefheartian artwork,As a Beefheart fan and completist I was pleased to get hold of this album and the track selection is great. The Beefheartian style artwork in the cd booklet is also amazing
2,Didn't enjoy it,"I was so disappointed in this one; I had heard wonderful things about MJ so I was expecting so much more. After the first couple of chapters I skimmed thru twice as much as I read. The heroine was suppose to be young & naive; what I got was an airheaded nit-wit... an annoying one at that! I can't even imagine a man putting up with her nonsensical rambling, much less falling in love with her. The hero was probably suppose to be the brooding type - it went a little over-board to me.... hardly no personality.Well, I have heard good things about MJ, so I'm going to give one of her more recent books a try."
5,"Specific topics, but broad range - very useful","This book is a great book to have around to help solve some of the problems encountered day to day. I haven't found a topic that hasn't been covered in this book, and the authors hit the nail on the head when describing subjects. This is a great book for anyone who deals with multi-platform networks. I reach for it first every time I see a current or potential problem. 90% of the time I can just use this book instead of having to search through topic-specific manuals and references."
4,The Complete SysAdmin,"Excellent text on the duties of a SysAdmin. Easy to comprehend, concise and covers the realm of duties in detail. Chapters are organized to allow quick and easy access for reference. If you are a SysAdmin or if you are going to be one - Buy this Book!Theo"
4,Detroiters ROCK ON!!,"This album shows yet again that Detroit puts out the best!To the person who said that KISS was not mentioned in ""Detroit City"" - catch up on your history - KISS is not from Detroit!!Very pleased with the shout out for ICP!! They deserve it!"
1,I can't believe this !,"What the hell is this? This can't be an Alice Cooper album.Instead of this I recommend Brutal Planet which is a better album ten times over. I think this is a pethatic attempt to go into popular music (bands like Blink 182, Sum41 or whatever). Alice Cooper is a shock rock legend, this album does not really say it! I have high respect into his earlier work but I just can't listen to this record more than once."
2,He did dat -n- done dat... already!!!,Alice is what... 200 years old and still singing teenager songs? No originality here. No maturity here. No progress here. Just rehashing older material. Pull out Billion Dollar Babies or Killers if you want Alice. Don't waste your time on this!
4,A very Good Rock Albumn,"I think if you listen a few times you'll like it a lot. One guy said what is he doing with these twenty somethings and what happened to the Piercings and Dark Metal guys from Brutal and Dragontown? I got news for you bud...These are the same guys! Der...Alice just wanted to get back to doing Rock and not Nu-Metal. I too love Dragon and Brutal but His roots are in Rock and that's what this record is. If he did another Brutal or Dragon we'd all be like hey this is the same stuff let's see something new... A good solid Rock Albumn! Listen a few times and you'll still see all the talent that is Alice! One note of advice...CRANK IT REALLY LOUD IT SOUNDS BETTER THAT WAY AND YOU'LL FEEL THE BASS, BUT IT WON'T FRY THE SPEAKERS AT BLISTERING VOLUMES, LIKE SOME OF THE NU-METAL DOES! Though I still like that sound too..."
5,"Not just a great Cooper album, a great rock album period!","This is just a terrific, fun, rock'n roll album. Not one you should analyze and disect everytime you listen, but one you should play at parties, or in your car with the windows down.Most of the tracks harken back Cooper's earlier days. ""This House is Haunted"" sounds like it could've been on Welcome to My Nightmare. ""Detroit City"" and Bye Bye Baby"" sound like Cooper circa Killer or Billion $ Babies. Alice's voice sounds better than ever, and the band is top notch.No, this is not a high concept album like Brutal Planet and Dragontown (both great discs), but taken on its own, Eyes... is just a lot of fun. Buy it! The Coop deserves another comeback."
3,stripped down alice,"after two a string of awesome releases, trash, hey stoopid, last temptation, brutal planet and dragontown, this one was a bit of a let down for me. I like it; but it's so stripped down in some regards and it's more average. It doesn't have the punch of alot of his earlier works, but it's better than the next one I think."
3,"It rocks, but leaves you wondering????","This is a straight out Rock fest of tunes here folks, but it sounds like no other Alice Cooper out there. It's hard to tell what direction he was trying to go for in this one. Love It To Death and Billion Dollar Babies are to me, his best; this one doesn't come close, but I would tell any hardcore Alice fans to grab it if for anything, to have in your collection.Sorry Alice, still a big fanatic, but this one will be lucky to be played once a month.3 STAR RATING FROM SCRAGGY'S TOMB OF METAL, USA."
4,"Probably not his best, certainly not his worst !!!","After the brilliant Brutal Planet and the disappointing Dragontown Alice does NOT return with the expected part 3 of the trilogy that would complete the Brutal Planet and Dragontown series but with a totally 'back to the roots' album ! It lacks the magic of From the inside or Billion Dollar Babies but would certainly be believable as being an album compiled from unused demos for those albums. Best thing is that Alice doesn't get stuck in one direction with heavy albums like the aforementioned Brutal Planet and Dragontown but completely delivers the opposite that sounds like the classic albums. It may not become a classic Cooper album in time but I have to say that the more I play the album, the more I love it. Brilliant band too and this album has a few very precious jewels !!! Listen to Novocaine and you know what I mean with 'classic Cooper'."
1,Last Temptation to buy Alice,"The Last Temptation to me was one of Alice's Last classic albums! Sandwiched between hits like poison and this new album, it is amazing how versatile he is! I just do not like the LA kid sound that this album has. Come on back to Temptation if you want some great lyrics and classic ALICE! Still love ya ALICE!! Just please, do not call this album a Classic, More like typical LA-Hollywood kid rock."
3,Detroit city is a copy of Gilbert O'Sullivan's Ohh-Wakka-Doo,"This is a good album overall, but with some flaws. The biggest one is that Detroit city is a copy of Gilbert O'Sullivan's Ohh-Wakka-Doo-Wakka-Day, just listen to the chorus and you will see it. But it has some nice tracks like Novocaine, Be with you awhile or Love should never be like this. The eyes... is the best album by Alice Cooper since The last temptation. I think any fan of alice will like this."
5,"So sweet, gorgeous and innocent looking","I ordered these earrings as a birthday present for my 18-year old cousin. I was looking for something really small and ""innocent"" looking. And I've found just that. The picture shown here doesn't do the necklace justice. These earrings were absolutely beautiful and so appropriate for an innocent girl. The pearls are very lustrous, but the diamond is not the whole ""dot"" that you see in the picture here. It is surrounded by white gold(?) metal accents to look bigger, but is still very attractive. Combined with the matching necklace, these are a perfect addition for anyone, especially those who are looking for small, not ""yelling-at-you"" jewelry."
3,"Provocative, makes unsubstabtiated statements","Provocative in every sense of the word, Genesis Unbound presents the thesis that the ""land"" in Genesis 1 actually is the ""promised land"". The arguments are interesting, but his own translation which is weak on exegesis and highly interpretive -- even paraphrastic -- becomes the shakey foundation on which the thesis rests. The authors' integrity is undermined by general and unsubstantiated comments about named and unnamed scholars whose arguments are dismissed. Nevertheless, the book is a must-read for anyone who wants to look at Genesis 1 with a fresh perspective."
4,The screw base is not as expected.,"This is an awesome lamp packed with LED's but heads up - the base is not medium,it is actually normal size on the screw in end."
3,B&D Cordless Scrubber,"I found this item to be useful for scrubbing our (plastic coated) deck. It has small ridges on the walking surface and the brush gets them clean. BTW, the deck is white.I was not enamoured about the assembly - the pieces were all separate and both ends had much grease that had to be cleaned before any handling or assembly.You may want to keep the container it was shipped in for the extra wand to be stored in.I was pleased with the 18 volt rechargeable battery - I used it for an hour or more the first time and it held the charge very well until I was finished. Also, altho the speed of the brush turning is not real fast, that is an advantage because you do not get water, or whatever you use for cleaning solution, splattered all over you whilst using it.All in all, I am happy with the purchase."
2,Disappointing - Underpowered,"I own a number of B&D;'s 18V tools - this is the first one I am disappointed with. It is probably going back to Amazon.The tool is underpowered even with a fully charged battery. It won't even turn in a bucket of water after a few minutes of use. I've tried it with seven different battery packs(including two fully charged ""extreme"" packs) all giving the same result.Nice idea by B&D; but poor execution."
2,Not up to expectations!,"I have three issues with this product: 1- Too heavy for a female user, 2- Brush is too soft for tile or cement floors and 3- Lacks power so only good for very light scrubbing. I will probably only use it to clean the windows and vinyl siding on the house."
1,Don't Like It,"I purchased this to clean my wood deck and it did not work for that purpose at all; it did not have enough power to get the deck clean. I was completely disappointed that it did not work for this.I then used it for cleaning my cars and it worked well. However I have a compact car and a ""small"" SUV so it is not really necessary to use this. The amount of time I save using this to clean my car is used getting the item out of the garage, putting it together, and then putting it away. Therefore I find I never use it.I was going to try using it for cleaning the high vaulted ceiling windows in my house but probably won't because I have a ""squeegie"" / duster on a long pole that will probably work just as well with less hassle.I had an Amazon gift certificate so only paid half the listed price but I still regret purchasing it."
3,Locking Device maked it discontinued,"I like using it on my car with the softer brush and with the harder brush on the house, windows concrete.Only issue with the unit is the locking device on the pivot ball won't lock so the ball pivot annoyingly will swing away from the angle your using it at and believe this is why it was discontinued but still sold till there all gone so I got mine for a lot less then retail and still worth it."
3,More Power,"This product does not have the power to handle really baked on dirt. Good for normal cleaning assignments on cars and windows and such but the power and brushes are not suited for cleaning off built up dirt on driveways, decks and walls.Avila Ace Hardware was slick on delivery. Well before schedule and packed in its original box. Ready to go."
1,emil,"This item came with no invoice or return instructions. It doesn't work nearly as good as a hand brush on a pole. It lacks power,is awkward,out of balance with the reach extender attached and the head doesn't swivel when you want it to. Also, what ticks me off is that I paid $109.00 plus $35.00 shipping for it. Later I found the same item at Menards for only $29.95. I couldn't beleive my eyes so I ask the manager if they had it priced right, he said it was. If I didn't have to pay shipping both ways and if I knew where to send it, I would return it. I guess the seller knows what their doing. I got screwed and I won't forget."
2,"Okay, but...","This unit is okay but beware the brush head pivots and strips out very easily. The brush head pivots so you can adjust the angle at which to use it. After 3 uses the locking mechanism stipped out, and now the head does not lock in very securly- causing it to move around while using."
2,poor product,product is very cumbersom. could use a liquid soap dispenser. it is very difficult when you have to keep dunking it in a bucket of soap and water. could also use a a hose attachment. Television advertisement makes it look a lot easier to use than it is.
3,Very usefull but with improvements needed,"For the most part I am very pleased with the product. However, the brushes rotate very slowly and only have one speed available. The other thing that needs improving is that the tool is out of balance. The battery end being much heavier than the brush end, a more neutral balance would make the tool easier to use and less of a strain on your back. A soap dispenser and a hose hook-up would also be welcome additions."
2,Black & Decker NPS1018 18-Volt Cordless Electric Power Scrubber,I purchased the Black & Decker NPS1018 18-Volt Cordless Electric Power Scrubber a few months ago after i got it i charged it up and then i washed my truck only to get frustrated that the head would not stay locked. I was so frustrated with it. I tried to see if something was missing but its the way it was poorly designed. Seems that black & Decker knew it but did nothing to fix the problem before dropping this off to the consumer. This is the first and last Black & Decker product i will by. For anyone looking to buy this i would not waste your money.
4,"Great value, time saver.","What a time saver. We had the chore of scrubbing mold off of ceilings. This little scrubber did the work of 3 people in half the time and we did not even have to get on a ladder....yahoo. I was concerned about battery life so I bought an extra battery and quick charger, and also ordered the 4"" brush. Works great. I wish there was a wire brush or very stiff bristle attachment, but it is well worth the cost as is."
4,Good but not perfect,"This piece of equiptment lived up to the reviews that had been published on it. It is well made, is substantial, convenient to use and as is the case with most battery operated machines, slow!It takes it's time to perform a task but eventually does a satisfactoy job.I am not disappointed with my purchase even though I did have to purchase an additional 4 inch scrubbing brush to clean my deck."
5,B&D NPS1018 Elec scrubber,"Excellent product! Used it for the 1st time yesterday to clean my gutters as they're were dingy grey. After 3 hrs, they're completely white w/ the help of a cleaner agent. Very torque so it has some scrubbing powere and I got 4 hrs out it before it started to show signs the battery was waning. I'd recommend it again to anyone. Next, will be the cars w/ the other scrubber!"
5,Best!,"Macadamias are the healthiest nuts out there, but unfortunately also quite expensive. This deal is excellent! They are fresh, delicious straight from the bag. I dry roast them myself so can be sure no rancid oils were added.It's the best deal. My problem is how not to eat too many! :)"
3,only decent,"I bought this for my aging korg keyboard. I only use it for storage and moving, I don't gig with it. The shoulder strap broke the first day. But the protection is good."
1,The sound quality doesn't respect the qreatness of the music,"After more than two years of enjoying The Baldwin Street Music and the Hep CDs of the similar content immensely, I took a chance on this CD because of the other customer's positive review. The sound quality of this CD is TERRIBLE. I don't understand why these sides with Glen Miller and Charlie Barnet, which were issued with good sound previously, sound so atrocious here. The sound quality of the Jewel and Lamplighter/Crystalette sides is equally abysmal. It is a great shame because the performances of Kay Starr and the orchestras are really great. I'm really disappointed."
5,Excellent Historical Coverage of the African-American Experience in NYC,I used this book in my history class and it covered in great detail the experience of African-Americans from their arrival in NY under Dutch control to the end of the 19th Century. I encourage anyone who is interested in learning more about NYC's rich history to pick this up!
5,Great way to learn about Latin poets,"Short (25-40 page) biographies mixed in with photographs, poems and reflections on the parts of Italy the poets are most associated. Highet makes both the poets and poems come alive and made me want to book my tickets to Italy ASAP. Great book."
4,Poets in a Landscape,"Highet is wonderful. Clear, accessible writing that makes the Classical world come to life. Reading this book made me want to dive into the Odes and other works he describes. Phooey on Postmodernism."
4,A fun soundtrack!!!!,"Any fan of Will and Grace will want a copy of this cd. This cd includes songs that have been incorporated in particular episodes or songs by guest starring singers. There are classic songs like Elton John's ""The Bitch is Back"" and remixes of song's like ""White Flag"" by Dido. Of course, no Will and Grace soundtrack would be complete without a song from Jack's idol, Cher, so ""Gypsies, Tramps and Thieves is included. My favorite would have to be ""The Right Thing to Do"", a duet by Carly Simon and Megan Mullally. Its a very nice song and the twosome sound really good together. Eric McCormick does a nice job on his song, ""Living With Grace"" as well. Repeat guest star, J-Lo, has ""Waiting for Tonight"" and ""Oops...I Did it Again"" by Britney Spears is part of the set too. A fun cd from a funny show!!!"
3,Not as Bad as I thought,"With this being Will and Grace's final season and the final episode airing this week, this soundtrack will be a HOT itemThis combination of 1980 disco and pop standards (I will survive, Gypsys Tramps and Thieves, The Bitch is Back, Its not unusual), modern remakes (like the Bacon Bros's remake of Footloose and Carly Simon (with Megan Mullany) remake of The Right Thing to Do) and stuff from J-Lo, Brittany seems to work.The best cut on the cd is Eric McCormick (with Barry Manilow)singing Living with Grace. This cut alone proves he should record an album himself.Now where is Sean Hayes song-he needed one too! The worst cut is the radio mix of dialog with some sort of hip hop on ""He's Hot"".If you want a musical memory of this show, it good....I's rather have the DVDSBennet Pomerantz, AUDIOWORLD"
4,Will & Grace Fans - must buy,"I'm glad they put this album out. I LOVE will & Grace, they are simply the best, and each song on the cd represents SOMETHING that happened on the show.. It's just great. There's even a track where Megan Mullally sings with Carly Simon. For those of you that don't know, that's Karen from the show.. The HILARIOUS one! She can sing too.. :) W&G fans - buy this! It's great for memories."
3,Pretty Good Quality,"Writing on CD. However plays very well. Normal use to case. For the price, this was great. Took awhile to receive."
2,why do they even have a soundtrack,i love the show but see no point to this cd. got it as a gift and sure its fun but nothing special and i already own most of these songs. just another ploy for NBC to make even more $$ of people willing to spend it on crappy stuff.
5,"it's great ,ophélie is verry good!!!",IT's A GREAT ALBUM WITH A LOT OF GOOD SONGS. I THINK OPHéLIE IS A VERRY GOOD SINGER AND I WOULD LOVE TO MEET HER .
5,Carmilla is the best vampire sotory ever,"Carmilla is incredibly short by modern standards. A victorian novel that **predates** anything Braum Sotker did - this classic was heavilly plagarized by Stoker (much to his credit for having excellent taste). This is a must read in its original form. If you do enjoy this novella you will probably also highly enjoy ""La Horla"", which is probably the second best vampire story ever penned."
4,I WAS VERY SURPRISED.......,..........Now to tell you the honest truth i was very skeptical at first to rent this movie(some one talked me into it) .....but after waching it i can proudly say that i really engoyed this movie from begining to end.......(one of the better low budget movies that i have seen lately) .....So trust what i say and sit back one evening and wach this VERY FUNNY movie!!!
1,bad trip,"very stupid movie, wish i could get a refund or a replacement rental.this movie should be taken off the market. no one should buy or rentthis movie."
2,Doesn't Get Anywhere,"This movie doesn't really get anywhere. There is no pivotal moments or climaxes. It has a few funny scenes, but overall I kept waiting for something significant to happen and it never did."
1,lame,"boring, lame, useless, pathetic, slow, dry, shallow, fast-forward a lot, 2 out of 10, skip it, not worth watching, too long, not worth my time, sorry I watched it."
3,No Wag the Dog,"This film was worth a look but it's no ""Wag The Dog"" or ""The Player"". With this concept and this cast it should have been a classic movie.... but it ended up as only a lightweight unfortunately."
1,Not worth the price.,"It was free :(, and still not worth the price. Don't bother. The plot kept waiting for something to happen."
3,De Niro can fix anything,"Put Robert De Niro in any film and it makes it watchable. This film was not his best but certainly could have been worse. It's a sleeper, there is something to be enjoyed in watching it if you are in a space to pay attention to the entire film."
3,Poor Ending,The movie started well but ended poorly. There did not seem to be a true resolution for the main character's conflict.
2,Redundant,"rehash of the vapid and soulless community of Hollywood power players. I'm so tired of movies where the lead character answers his cell phone dozens of times. Don't we see that enough in real life? DeNiro does what little he can with this material. Read ""The Last Tycoon"" instead."
2,Movie is confusing,I got this movie because of Kristen Stewart was acting in but I don't know I really didn't like it :/
2,a good book becomes a weak movie -- ain't that always the way?,"Robert De NIro gives his most appealing, least mannered performance in years. Unfortunately, it's for this lifeless Hollywood satire (based on the fun memoirs of producer Art Linson) that has nothing new to say."
1,"Went immediately into my ""get rid of"" pile","I bought this based on a recommendation. The box says ""laugh out loud"" - maybe the lines that were supposed to make me laugh out loud were inside jokes, but I didn't even find a little giggle in this film. When it was all over, my reaction was ""What was this all about?"""
1,What A Turd !!!!!!!!!!!!!!!,"Wow...... what a waste of talent, lack of script, & waste of time!!!! This movie is described as a comedy, are you kidding me? There was nothing funny! It was boring, uninteresting, poorly edited and just plain stupid. I don't understand how anyone could like this movie.I want my $1.49 back from the video store. No wonder it bombed at theaters (or did it ever come out?!)."
1,Q: What Just Happened? A: Nothing,"In this so-called comedy, Robert DeNiro plays a producer who is having a bad day. His most recent film (which stars Sean Penn) has tested horribly with early audiences and his director refuses to budge on its disturbing ending. His ex-wives (both of them) live high on the hog in his ex-mansions while he makes do with a closest sized room full of plastic-wrapped furniture. His next big project is about to go belly up because its star (Bruce Willis) refuses to shave. And his therapist isn't helping matters any, either.Yes, yes, yes. Hollywood is a dark, soulless industry populated by manipulative, selfish, shallow individuals. The film breaks no new ground, offers no clever insights, and doesn't even have the energy to be zany or delightful. It's just a big, black blah that thinks it's being sardonic. Avoid, avoid, avoid."
1,What Just Happened?,What Just Happened?No Stars at all but review format would not let me skip #2. Terrible movie. Almost did not finish watching it but made myself since I bought it. The only good part was Bruce Willis throwing a fit and cussing up a storm.
1,A Movie That Puts You To Sleep...Fast,"I rented this movie and in the first five minutes I found myself watching a movie of other people watching a movie. A test audience is actually watching the movie that Robert DeNiro's character has produced, and we have to watch them watch the movie. How boring. There is not one funny line in the movie despite the reviews on DVD case. If I wasn't watching with a group of people I would of turned it off before I fell asleep. I really didn't care about the characters or what happened to them. The only person who had a major role was DeNiro (and even he was boring) while everyone else had minimal roles. So when you see names like Sean Penn, Stanley Tucci, and Bruce Willis you expect a pretty good movie, but if you blinked you'll miss'em in this one. A wretched film to say the least. Save your money."
2,Selling De Niro's face,"I didn't bother renting this one based on the description. It looked a lot like they were just trying to sell a lousy movie by putting De Niros face on the cover. Based on the ratings I'm seeing, they probably were."

2,Disappointed,"I purchased this book in hopes of learning HOW to apply Rational Emotive Behavioral Therapy. I was disappointed. If one is looking for a history of the psychology of self esteem, this book may fill the bill. If one, however, is looking for specific techniques to apply, this book will most likely leave you wanting. The best book I have found to teach Behavioral Therapy is ""Feeling Good"" written by David Burns M.D.."
2,USA and self esteem are the same thing,"Though I have great respect for Dr. Ellis, he totally blows it with his title. His description of Unconditional Self Acceptance IS self esteem. What he calls USA is what shrinks call self esteem! There is a mistaken definition of esteem based on accomplishment, this is not now and has never been self esteem!!!!! Try the Self-Esteem Game, it proves my point.PS what he calls self esteem I call narcissism. That said, I only disagree with his terminology, not his theory."
2,Self-Esteem Revisited...,"I don't even need bother to read this book. Just read the work of the ""Father of the Self-Esteem"" movement, Nathaniel Branden. Start with his book, ""Honoring the Self"". Dr. Ellis statement is only true of false self-esteem, not the real deal. Self-Esteem means destructive ego to most people or approval seeking as Ellis describes. Self acceptance is a major tenet of self-esteem but not the totality of it. Read Branden's book and you will know the ""Six Pillars of Self-Esteem"" which is another must read book of his. This however is not to trash Albert Ellis overall. He has much good to say."
2,Deceptive advertisement for product,"I did not read the reviews for this product, which I think is the one and only time I have never done so. If I had, I would not have been surprised when unopened the package and found it not to be a "" Yamaha"" brand product as specified, but a generic no-name product. The product does appear like the one in the picture and should work just fine, I just hate deception in advertising especially in regards to online shopping when you rely on the honesty of the seller to provide legitimate descriptions of their products and not use a brand name to suck your sale in. The fast mail service would have impressed me to buy again until I opened the package only to see I had bit on a bait and switch."
1,Don't buy,"I bought this for my Hutchen's flute and this does a very bad job of cleaning the flute. All the moisture simply gets redistributed throughout the length of the flute! The material on this flute cleaner is NOT AT ALL absorbent. I expected it to suck up the moisture immediately on contact, since that would be the only good way to clean a flute. I'm a flute newbie and this is disappointing. I have read on other reviews that it's best to use a cleaning rod with a cleaning cloth, so I will buy those and see how that works out."
2,Scrub that,"I like Joe Daly's work but ""Scrublands"" is probably his weakest book. It contains very short strips about sexually shaped sculptures or sexually shaped vegetables, some weird stoner humour, and some avant-garde nonsense. Most of the characters look disturbing and monstrous-like as if they were characters from an old MAD magazine strip. The book contains few strips worth remembering though his distinctive drawing style becomes quite likeable after a while, and I can highly recommend his other books, ""Red Monkey Double Happiness"" (a kind of South African stoner Tintin adventure, very fun read with lots of excellent artwork, this time in colour), and the ""Dungeon Quest"" series which is a parody of the old board game ""Dungeons and Dragons"" in comic book form. ""Scrublands"" is a weak introduction to this great comic book artist and would only appeal to fans of the previous books (like me) looking for more of the same - and not finding it here."
5,"Awesome!, Awesome!, Awesome!",Man! Why has no one reviewed this yet!? It's GREAT! It's different than you're basic underground comic or graphic novel and it's time people found out about his guy! Please make more Joe Daly!! Buy this book.
3,Accelerated a bit too much!,"I believe what Bob says in his book (regarding health)is true and valuable, but this accelerated program is over the top. For someone like me who works out 4 x a week this program is a bit crazy. I asked myself the BIG question what happens after the program is finished; you can't maintain a lifestyle of working out like that. To me it was one more loss weight quick program."
4,"Fast shipper, as described","Fast shipper, as described Fast shipper, as described Fast shipper, as described lg.g. . .g f. .b.gg.GFast shipper, as described"
2,Bob Greene's book,"Personally, nothing new and nothing really to learn. Wouldn't suggest buying it. I think eating healthy is obvious and exercise is obvious. For that do not understand nutrition in any way, then it might be something to glance through."
4,Great Book,This book even works well for those of us with knee problems. The high emphasis on cardio really works.
3,Sort of Okay,What Bob Greene doesn't tell you is that many of his exercises take exercise machines that people don't have at home.
4,Good information,I really enjoyed reading this book. It has good common sense tips and I especially liked the contract with myself.
2,Is this Oprah's trainer?,"Well....Oprah is fat again, so I think I'm going to be skipping the Bob Greene diet."
1,We all going to get old hopefully and then kick the bucket!,"Want to save some money ? Sure you do! So get up and take a walk, work in the garden, go for a swim etc. Then cut down on the fast food you eat and reduce your servings of what you do eat. Works for me!So get a life and don't worry as we all wind up leaving this mortal coil sooner or later!"
4,Good One,"Author has done a great job in writing a book that is simple yet effective. Easy to read and follow, this book guides the reader to maximize weight loss results. Its Good for those who need discipline in their routine,this book is really good, [...]"
3,Defective Volume 9,"As with any other fan of DBGT I was excited to see this next saga of DBGT. However, as me and my friend Smithers watched the first volume of the Super 17 saga we were shocked to see that the DVD was defective do to the pixalation of the screen at four different parts of the DVD. I exchanged the DVD thinking that it was just my DVD that was causing the mysterious pixalation. However, after I exchanged the ""defective DVD"" I was suprised to see that the new DVD was pixalating at the same exact place as the first DVD. This is annoying and I hope Funimation corrects this mistake because I hate to pay money for a defective product."
5,abrasive disc cleaner,This product is the cats meow! Works very well in cleaning my sanding discs for my 10 inch sander. For no more than it cost me it will save me a lot of money in the long run. Very satisfied with this product and highly recommend it.
3,Average software.,"CAUTION!: This book/CD has EXCACTLY the same CD/software like the ""The Very Best Coaching and Study Course for the New Gre General Test"". I bought both of them and I wasted my money since I care only for the CD/software. I contains three CATS which is good but it is not even in my top 5 recommendations for the GRE."
1,Disappointing work,"A big disappointment from a wonderful Italian singer who usually produces great work. There is a very promising selection of pieces here, but most of the arrangements are surprisingly unimaginative, and the cd as a whole ends up plodding along with little energy. Also, two of the tracks are taken directly from previous albums. I highly suggest giving a listen to the superior work ""Charade"" (1995) or even ""Exit"" (1998) before this one."
3,An adequate beginning to a brilliant series.,"When I first read ""Over Sea Under Stone"" I was disappointed, and only went on to read the rest of Cooper's ""Dark Is Rising"" series because I didn't have much else to read. Was I ever glad I did! This first book of the series is barely adequate, but the rest of the series is brilliant. I suggest you read ""The Dark is Rising"" (the second book) first, and then your passion will be enough to carry you through this book. The first two books have almost entirely different sets of characters, who only meet up in the third (""Greenwitch""), so don't worry about reading the second first....The series, however, is a MUST."
4,The Concealed Mystery,"Over Sea, Under Stone, by Susan Cooper, supports the theme of the search for the Holy Grail, and the fight over good and evil. Like in the legend of King Aurthur, the Holy Grail is the key to winning the seemingly never-ending battle of good and evil in this amazing novel. This story is mainly about three children, Simon, Jane, and Barney Drew. The Drew children, visiting their great uncle Merry stumble upon a secret opening to the attic, where they have lunch. What they find in the attic begins a quest for the Holy Grail that results in a thrilling and suspenseful novel. The excitement in this story makes it a must read for junior high students interested in the Arthurian legend."
4,Lewis,The story begins when a family moves to a new house and they find a manuscript in there atic.And the manuscript has words and symbols that they can not under stand on it. And they have to get clues from there map to get from one clue to the next clue to find a tresure they think is at the end of the clues that they follow. But along the way people are trying to catch them so they can get the map and go to the tresure when they are going clue to clue. The people are first shadowy so you can not think or visualize of what they look like. will not tell you who is tring to catch them you will have to read the book to find that out. I liked the book because there is a lot of adventure in the book and because it is not that hard to read because it does not have big words. It does not get boringbacause of the adventure. In the front of the book it says a fifth grader can read. It has two hundred and fifty two pages.And the auther is Susan Cooper.
5,An amazing book! Cornwall comes alive in Cooper's retelling!,In this book Susan Cooper explains the story of three children who spend holiday in Cornwall with their Great Uncle find King Arthur's Holy Grail. Cooper makes this battle between Light and Dark for the Holy Grail a memorable story. In her telling it seems to come alive
2,Unimpressed,"After seeing the movie trailer I was pretty excited to start this series, especially since I am a big fan of fantasy books (Harry Potter, Narnia, Lord of the Rings, etc). However, I couldn't have been more disappointed. There search for the Grail won't be exciting to anyone older than 10, its predictable, unbeilievable, and the characters are underdeveloped and boring. Hopefully this series gets better as i have already bought the second book..."
4,Good Book!!!,"Barnabas, Jane, and Simon are staying in Trewissick (a town by the sea) with their great-uncle. There, a dangerous adventure starts and continues until the last book in the sequence, Silver On The Tree. This book was a little confusing in the middle. The Dark Is Rising (book 2 in the sequence) is much better."
4,Over Sea Under Stone Kid Review!,"I thought this book was really good, at the beginning it was kind of boring then it got better as you went along. I read this book in a book club and some people liked it and some people not. I think people who like mysteries and other adventure you should get a copy of Over Sea Under Sone at a store near you!"
4,Come to Cornwall to help solve this medieval mystery.,"Over Sea, Under Stone is a suspenseful mystery/fantasy novel that will keep you on the edge of your seat. You will be absorbed in the dialogue and description as Susan Cooper leads you through the mystery of the hidden grail. The continuing action will keep you reading the book, and the plot will make you want to know what happens next. Over Sea, Under Stone is an enchanting mystery that will keep you guessing the resolution until you're done."
5,A Children's Book with great prose and language!!!,"Our children enjoyed this book a lot. I have purchased all the others in the Dark is Rising series because I was so pleased with this book. It did take longer to read than your ""average"" chapter book because of the rich language. (I had to explain things often) The book had just the right amount of imagination, suspense, mystery all built around the neat relationships of the children and their Great Uncle Merry. I would consider this book one worthy of purchasing in hardback and adding to your home library. Enjoy!!"
5,Excellent,"I read this book after reading the second volume in this series, The Fark is Rising. It was quite a shock in terms of style! This is a book that deals with serious issues and puts its youthful protagonists in stressful, dangerous situations, but it does read like a children's book. It is firmly grounded in the ""real"" everyday world, rather than the world of myth that suffuses The Dark is Rising. It is definitely a conscious decision to have this difference in style, and it works well."
3,"over sea, under stone",This book is about people who three childern discover a anciant map in a house that has something speacial in it. But they had to fight evil as they call the dark. When they search for it there selves they put on their very lives in peril. But over all the vampire lives over the sea and under the stone when the moon comes out. simon had been sitting making darts out of the morning news paper.All of the derws hated the rain so when it rained they all stayed inside there house. When it was done raining the derws went outside and because they liked the fershness All of the derw famliy stayed in a cabin. They all new when exacley when it was time to wake up.
2,Horrible...,"I've currently read the first three books in this series. I love the other two, they read like ""Dark Shadows"", with a lovely mysterious feel to them. But this book seems more like ""Hardy Boys"", with only one instance of any real use of supernatural abilities."
1,The Search is on,"In the Book Over Sea under Stone By Susan Cooper the Drew children Barney, Simon, and Jane are on Vacation in Cornwall, England with their parents and great-uncle Merry. While exploring a hidden room in the old Grey House where they are staying, they stumble across an ancient map that throws them into a desperate search for an ancient grail which will unlock power to war against the Dark side. The Dark forces (real life people) are also looking for the grail that links back to the days of King Arthur and a fierce battle between good and evil that has ensued for hundreds of years.I wouldn't recommend this book to anyone. This book sounds very exciting but it is very hard to get into and it never makes you not want to put the book down because it gives you so much detail and it drags on everything. If I had to recommend to some one I would defiantly recommend it for 1st-3rd graders but even they would get bored."
4,over sea understone,A easy read that keeps your attention. Well thought out charecters. Quite topical if you have spent time in Cornwall. Read it as a 14 year old and still good to revisit 16 years later.
4,Curiscity,"...CuriosityOver Sea, Under Stone is set in the 1980's,mainly along the harbor in an old gray house. There are 3 Drew kids who are brothers and sisters named Barney, Jane, and Simon, and of coarse their Uncle Merry. The 3 Drew kids find a manuscript in the attic about where the Holy Grail is. But first the Drew kids have to find the other half, of the manuscript. The journey for the Grail leads them to a extremely large cold, wet, and really dark cave. The Drew kids still run into some problems along the way through. They have to beat other people to the"
4,Drawing The Line on Emotions (Being Mad),"""I get so mad"" - descriptions of things and times when children get mad (being blamed for something they didn't do, having to take a nap when they're not tired, having an ""accident"" and everyone laughs, etc).This is a book that every child can relate to. The one part that I did not like was the portion (and picture) when the child is about to hit a cat because it had run across the road (and almost got run over by a car). I did not think that it was appropriate for the author and the illustrator to convey that it is acceptable to punish ill behavior by striking another thing.Parents should talk to their children about feelings of anger and seek alternatives to violent behavior.The illustrations are in black, white and orange. It is very detailed and effectively portrays the feelings of anger, rage and of being mad. It is not a typical bedtime story. I would recommend reading this when a parent/teacher has an ample opportunity to dicuss this topic in depth."
2,A bit cheap,"The hold switch fell off at first use. The buttons on top are not labeled, no arrows, squares, etc. At least it works, I guess."
1,I would rank it O stars if they had it.,Lid to CD player wiil not latch Amazon sent me a replacement however it would not close also. I never received credit for the unit.Jeffery Pope
5,brilliant,"they should have this book on the curriculums and syllabuses of all economic, political & history courses at all colleges and universities of the world.the establishment always brainwash people with one side of the story.jamil salmi tells it from the victim's side."
2,not as good as I hoped for,"This is an OK CD, but not as good as I was hoping for. I bought it as a gift, and it was by the wrong performer, so I kept the CD for myself."
5,good melodic rock,"I heard this playing at a cd store. I asked the guy at the counter who it was. I thought it was coldplay. He told me it was the leaves. I bought the album. I was floored at how good it is. I know they sound a little like coldplay. They do have there own sound though. I recomend this cd to fans of coldplay,travis,radiohead."
3,Nice,"It's interesting to find an Icelandic band who doesn't sound like Sigur Ros or The Sugarcubes---in other words, cliche. However, as good the songs are--and the band itself isn't that bad either--- it sounds soooo sooo very similar to Coldplay, Radiohead, and other popular British bands. So much that this record feels more like a collection of songs that could have been songs sung by Coldplay and Radiohead, but instead were taken by a group of Icelanders from Reykjavik. It makes me wonder what this band's motives are: to sound like these bands because they admire them? Is it supposed to be a tribute to the style of today's British pop-rock sound? Are they trying to find who they are as a band? Whatever it is, i just don't get it. As for the Icelandic touch, I didn't hear or see that either. Nice band from Iceland, but they sound so similar to other bands that it's just creepy and highly distracting. Why listen to this band when I could listen to Radiohead or Coldplay?"
2,Sound good? Yes. Sound original? No.,"Leaves are another nice little inoffensive indie band to add to your growing collection of Radiohead, Coldplay, The Verve, Travis, Starsailor, Lowgold, Lorien, Haven, Aqualung, Doves...sure its a nice sound and ""Catch"" is lovely but its hardly new to the ears - the same emotions and sounds are evoked by other bands, better. In fact this CD sounds ridiculously like Doves: the lead singer sounds exactly the same as Jimi Goodwin and sometimes the songs sound like what Doves would do.If you want this kind of thing go for either Radiohead (because they are more experimental) or Coldplay (because they do the simplistic nice inoffensive ballad better than the rest). If you want something that sounds exactly like this but came first, go for Doves. If you want some really good Icelandic music go for Sigur Ros. But its hard to see many people being satisfied with this album."
3,Too Coldplay for Comfort!,"This Icelandic band has Coldplay's style down pat. Too well in parts, sometimes it's hard to tell the two bands apart. and that can either be a good or bad thing depending on your perspective. Well, you could argue that Coldplay's entire approach is derived from Radiohead's *The Bends* to begin with. So there you go."
4,Great CD,"I heard about this from a music rep friend. The reviews from Rolling Stone, NME and Q are absolutely right in saying they are a mix of Coldplay, Sigur Ros. I would add the Doves to that list. These boys from Iceland have created some catchy tunes that should be heard. This is something to grab now and enjoy before they make it big here in the States."
3,"Good, Not Great","Overall, this album is not money wasted. It isn't exactly money well spent either. When I oringally read about what type of sound they have it was described as Coldplay meets Sigur Ros. Seeing as how both of these bands make very good music, I was really excited. In truth, this statement is accurate. For some reason, however, it just doesn't exicite me the same way either of the single components does. I think that it is funny how the lead singer is a dead ringer for Thom Yourke of Radiohead at times and Chris Martin of Coldplay at others."
1,Only one side works,"I was so happy when I got this in the mail so I immediately installed it and my static disappeared, but i could only hear one side of my headset."
3,Pyramid NS21 20 Amp RCA Noise Suppressor,"The Pyramid NS21 20 Amp RCA Noise Suppressor looks good and also well made, but it did not fix the ignition noise of my car, before this attempt I also try with similar products with the same result. I think I must take my car to an Audio Proffesional to fix it. Thank You..."
3,Doesnt completely reduce ground loop,"I got this for my Escalade to use with a Xbox or Media Player. Being that its in a car, ground loop is definitely going to happen. So I got this to replace another one. This one still creates a ground loop noise, has not completely gone away but been reduced enough to where its not annoying hearing the ear piercing ground loop noise."
2,Helps a little,"Reduces the noise from my ground loop on my PC->Suppressor->Amp->Speaker setup, but does not eliminate it. I was getting fairly bad static past 25% on the volume knob, now I get about the same amount of static as I use to at 25% now at around 60%.The RCA connectors are super cheap and so loose they could fall off.This was $5, so maybe I'm being too harsh, but spend $10 on a better one."
5,Air it out,"This was a prayer answered. I always got so tired of the standard air hoses getting tangled, caught under baseboards and door jambs, etc. This was the answer. I run anything from a pneumatic stapler, to a framing nailer, to a 1/2"" impact wrench...not a miss. You won't go wrong from this poster's viewpoint."
5,"Buy it, WELL worth the couple of bucks more!","If you use an air hose more than a few times a year these are a MUST have. The difference between using this product and a rubber hose cannot be over stated. Here are the benefits:Takes up about 1/4 the space.Feels like it weighs just a few ounces, great for trasporting and working. The reduction in fatique is unreal.The pain in the rear end of coiling and uncoiling rubber hoses is gone. This hose practically coils itself.Much more flexible, even in cold weather.If you want to straighten it out to get the ""coils"" out of it just put one guy on each end and pull, it straightens right out!These hoses are easily repaired on site.If you are a contractor this hose will pay for itself the first day in increased productivity.Its really not that much more money than the rubber hoses!Downside: All that still good rubber hose that will just dry-rot.2000 feet of rubber hose sitting in my garage that will never be used again."
1,It was a waste of money for me,All cats are different but I tried giving this to 6 different cats. Only one showed the slightest interest. She licked it a couple of times and walked away. The other 5 showed no interest at all and they all love regular catnip. It is very hard maybe that was the problem. I wouldn't suggest these to anyone.
1,My kitties are just so-so on this. .,I have 4 cats and I bought this because they seem to love catnip. For some reason this product does not generate a lot of interest. They treat it more like a ball to slap around but seldom bother with it. Very disappointed.
2,Disappointed,"I was disappointed in this product. My cat, who very much enjoys a cloth bag of catnip shows no interest in the pawbreaker. I was looking forward to her enjoying it, but she didn't."
5,Fun for all!,"I love this cat nip toy! It lasts forever-and Rocky never gets bored of it. I put it up on my bedroom bureau after she over doses on it-(really funny to watch her roll it around, chew and lick on it). I have had it for almost 6 months and it still attracts her. Unlike most cat nip toys If it has been sitting for a while just scratch it a bit to activate the odor of the cat nip-your cat will do the rest."
5,CRAZY!!,"This is one of the craziest & funniest catnip toys I have ever had. Cats went INSANE when it was delivered. They were trying to claw into the taped up box to get to this catnip ball!! And we used a tiny drill bit to drill a hole all the way through it, & I put a string through it & hung it off there cat tree!! They are having a ball with the catnip ball :)"
2,My Kitten...,Doesn't seem to enjoy this yet!!! As I brought five at one time and I currently have one somewhere hidden under something in my apartment.
2,Neko doesn't like it,"My cat Neko LOVES catnip but does not like this pawbreaker catnip toy! She's licked it maybe 2-3x, but thats it :("
2,Too hard.,None of my cats liked this catnip pawbreaker. Thay smelled it and walked away. After several days I threw it out. I think that it was much too compact and hard for them to even attempt to chew.
4,Catnip addicted,"Both of my cats loved these. Unfortunately they roll rather quickly and get hidden under the furniture. When I dig them out again, business as usual - they lick and bite these things to no end."
2,Hard To Listen To Straight Through,"With this release, Bleeding Through gains more recognition and gains alot of popularity. I think they rushed this album to try to acheive that. The CD starts off great with ""Love Lost In A Hail Of Gunfire."" But it starts to get worse from there. The songs are too long and start to get boring. Too many repetitions of the same part. And they all start to sound the same too. Total lack of originality. Its not so much a swift kick to your crotch like ""Portrait Of The Goddess"" was. If I were to recommend you one, I would tell you to get ""Portait"". I don't think they will ever be able to top that."
2,I'll pass on this one.,"My friend was hyping this cd and I had heard some songs from Portait of a Goddess that I thought were good so I decided to get it. As others have said, it is not the worst album ever made but it is far from the best. It sounds like something they threw together real fast in order to get a new cd out. Lots of the songs sound incredibly boring and repetitive. I was going to see them live(I even had tickets) but I got sick, and now I'm not sad that I missed them. Unless you are a diehard fan, skip this and get some other cd from a band with true talent."
2,the older cd is better,I think the older cd is way better. I baught this 1 and got bored real quik the keyboards get annoying and there isnt much breakdowns worth waiting for. But the older cds are great buy them.
2,"Scenesters, UNITE!","So, it's been said before and I'll say it again: this is some of the most generic stuff you'll ever hear. I downloaded it a long time ago, mainly because of all the hype around this band. I should've known better. I mean c'mon, they're on Trustkill. How much more scene can you get? But yeah, they have slightly above average instruments paired with horrible overdone vocals. I've heard them be called ""Blackmetalhardcore"" before (in Revolver Magazine). That made me laugh. Wow, they've got a keyboard, so that makes them part Black Metal? They sound nothing like Black Metal at all. While this slightly better than all the mallcore bands out now, it offers nothing new or different than all the other metalcore bands. It's better than Atreyu and 18 Visions, but that's not saying much, now is it?"
4,Not their best,"I bought this album 8 years ago when i was 13 yrs old. My taste in music has changed slightly- not to say that this album is bad it's just not as good as it could be. The only tracks i enjoy are love lost in a hail of gunfire, on wings of lead, number seven with a bullet, sweet vampirous, city of the condemned, this is love and Revenge i seek. The remaining 5 tracks sounded too repetitive in my opinion and just basically lacking in creativity. This album is definitely metalcore and honestly the sound that i prefer because as a long time fan of the band to me it's just more ""classic"" as recent Bleeding Through album's have gravitated more towards the swedish/black metal sound which is great and their new albums have been great but im just more into the older BT."
5,I'd Like To Say WHOA!!!,"I have to admit, I have liked Bleeding Through ever since i first heard ""Love Lost In A Hail Of Gunfire"", like every other hardcore band that has come out of Orange County they have made the reputation unbeatable. I saw them live and their stage pressence has only been equaled with Unearth. I have all 3 cd's of Bleeding Through and will continue buying BT albums as long as they make them. Best songs on here have to be.""Love Lost In A Hail Of Gunfire"" 10/10This Is Love, This Is Murderous"" Best opening line ever 9/10""Revenge I Seek"" old school Fear Factory but with a twist 9/10""On Wings Of Lead"" 10/10I would recomend any hardcore fan to buy this album.Also try Throwdown as BT was born from them."
5,Sincere and dark,"Bleeding Through is one of the greatest things to happen to heavy music in a long time. Having grown up in Orange County and having been given the chance to hang out with a few of them, I can tell you from the bottom of my heart that this band is sincere. I think their sincerity is what sets them apart from many other bands. Sure the music is amazing, but these guys love their scene and the people who support their scene. Thats why Bleeding Through is making such a huge impact on the hardcore, metal, and even punk scenes. There is a reason why Davey from AFI wears their shirts quite often and brings them on tour. There is a reson why just about every single hard music zine has had huge articles and interviews about them. It's not so much the music, but the message. Bleeding Through stay true to their scene and their fans. Thats why they matter."
3,"Bleeding Through - This Is Love, This Is Murderous","I'd have to say some of the previous reviews are a tad bit unfair and while I'd certainly recommend Bleeding Through's previous album over this one(Portrait Of A Goddess), this cd is still decent. Where the album really lacks is in the lyrics. If you can get past that, the music is still pretty brutal. Music aside, the album artwork is laughable. The excess of gore in the booklet and CD tray seems just a tad bit gimmicky. The production is lackluster as well. Standout tracks include ""Number Seven With A Bullet"" and ""On Wings Of Lead."" If you've never heard this band before, get Portrait Of A Goddess first."
1,"Yet, another generic metalcore band.","Sadly bt is another example that nu-metal kids are ruining the true sounds of pure metalcore. Im sure that this idiots, who like nu-metal-- want some how to fit in where metalcore is, so thats why we have bands like ""as i lay dying"","" bleeding trought"", &,"" avange the folds"" along with others. This is way to generic for me, and ,realy way to mediocre and thats not how metalcore suppost sound like! Ripping off cradel of filth doesn't make you a true metal person, at all. Im glad we stil got bands that are keeping it alive tho! Skip this crap!"
1,makes a great coaster,"first off, chimaira is nowhere NEAR the top metal band in america, they're new cd is almost as bad as this new bleeding through s*** and to all that think this is a great cd listen to some real metal, basically 90% of the relapse crew, but not this. trustkill records and bleeding through both suck right now, and everyone would do better as to look for some real talent that isn't wasted once they gain some popularity. for some actually REAL metal that is actually TALENTED metal, listen to some krisiun, vital remains, cryptopsy, or mastodon. but please, whatever you do, dont buy this cd."
2,Horrible!!!!,"I knew I should have heeded the advice from other reviews that found this cd to be horrible, but i decided to purchase it anyway just in case i thought different. I didnt. It was merely another cd put out that sounded just like all the rest. It was generic. THats all it was. Nothing special. If you are thinking about buying this cd dont. Go spend your money on something better like Comeback Kid, A Wilhelm Scream, or As I Lay Dying."
4,i dont see whats so bad about it,"i mean, im a huge fan of the great metal bands today like dillinger escape plan, converge, botch, lamb of god and bands like that...this cd is pretty damn good from what ive heard. if i listen to music and i like it who cares? i really dont care what their image is like...if you like the music who cares? pretty shallow if you ask me..."
1,Too generic for me... Im sorry.,"Bleeding throught to me sounds way to mediocre and generic and also the songs are realy repetive as well. I dont know how any one with self respect and who love true metalcore is able to enjoy the music of bleeding throught... I would be embarres to even wear their t-shirt to any metal concert! Quite boring & repetive as well as unoriginal at best. Don't even bother buying this album but for metalcore worth something then get remenbering never's latest album! What makes bleeding throught any difirent then staind,korn,slipknot ? Don't bother!"
1,generic & atreyu ripoff=bleeding throught!,"What is bt trying to do ?Rip-off atreyu ?It sure sounds that way to me.Anyway,Bascilly pretty damn mediocre and generic crap from bt and not even worth 1 cent at all! All the songs sound pretty much the same and the lirycs ? Idiotic. Can't belive one of my good friends enjoy this crap---im ashamed!There's realy nothing here that stands out it pretty much sounds like an rip off album of cradel of filth and atreyu all together.Its just sad.Don't bother... For good metalcore stick with atreyu,between the buried and me,blood has been shed but skip bleeding throught!"
1,I agree,"I agree with that person that said this is for skeleton-thin boys. I heard good things about these guys and thought i'd give it a listen. I can't beleive i spent money on this. I listened to it once and quarter way through i got bored and shut it off. Buy something that actually has talent and has an original sound (see classic thrash such as Sepultura, Slayer, Exodus, Anthrax, etc.)"
1,Awesome!,"There is about one good thing about with this band, and that is... the snare. It's like instead of writing a lot of good songs or killer riffs or bad ass solos, they sat in the studio for 8 hours tweaking the snare until it sounds the way it does. Man I wish I had this guy's snare...Oh, and about the album... it sucks... besides the snare."
1,Awful,"This band is so boring and retarded. You'd be better off listening to crap metalcore bands like Diecast or Hatebreed, or nu-metal bands such as Slipknot or KoRn. How can someone honestly listen through this whole album? Every song is just crap. I had to listen to this crap when they opened for Arch Enemy. Stay away from this eyeliner/punk wannabe OC crap. 1/10"
2,definelty not as good as people lead you to believe...,"the 3rd cd from bleeding through really doesnt come through to me as a classic metalcore cd. almost every song sounds exactly the same. the cd before this ""portrait of a goddess"" was an extremely good cd. its sad to see so many bands go downhill after they make really good cds. i like tracks 1-4 on this cd, but after that the cd just kind of dies, and the rest of it is one long song, that you want to end. the music on this cd also sounds really empty. theres not really any melodies or anything to bring out the musicianship of the members of this band. it just sounds like overproduced drums and very overproduced screaming over quiet guitars and quiet keyboards. i think it should of been an ep of the first 4 songs. a couple songs towards the end are alright songs i guess, but nowhere near good enough to save this cd. i really hope they get better next time. buy portrait of a goddess instead."
5,ANYONE WHO DOESN'T LIKE THIS CD SHOULDN'T LISTEN TO MUSIC,"All these people who are saying this cd sucks, can suck my (...). This is one of the best metal albums to come out. It's the perfect blend of death metal riffs combined with hardcore breakdowns. The vocals are sick, the drummer is great, and guitars tie everything together. So for anyone who listens to Norma Jean, As I Lay Dying, Poison the Well, Unearth, or any good music, should buy this CD. F@#k what anyone else says. And don't listen to that fagget who said this is music for fat gay kids. I'd like to see to see him say that to the singer of this band, then we'll see who the fat gay kid is."
2,Sucky,"This is a bad CD. The only good songs are ""On wings of lead"" and ""Murder by numbers"". The rest all suck. What i really don't like is that all of the songs sound excatly the same. I really like alternative rock and goth metal, but Bleeding Through sucks, or at least this album does. Avoid this garbage and buy metal such as Kittie,Otep,Lacuna Coil or Crisis instead."
1,pure crap,"First of all, I'd like to say that I am a HUGE fan of the last record. Portrait of the Goddess delivers a perfect blend of metal and hardcore, but this...this is just by far one of the most dissapointing records of the year. Weak riffs, weak lyrics, horrid production, I just can't think of anything good to say about this record. It sounds like there was zero thought put into these lyrics. The straight up brutal guitar sound found on Goddess is gone, hidden behind the horribly produced drums. I was really looking forward to this record, and was just totally let down. Pick up the new Avenged Sevenfold instead of this trash."
2,Dissapointing,"Bleeding Through gets too much credit. I thought this would've been better, because I had seen so many reviews and such that said it was outstanding. Most of the songs sound exactly the same. ""On Wings of Lead"", ""Revenge I Seek"", ""City of the Condemned"", and ""Love Lost in a Hail of Gunfire"" are pretty much the only good/alright songs on this album. I wouldn't buy this album, unless it was 7-9 $. Not something I'd expect from Trustkill."
1,"Get the 96"" ""Red Eye Records"" reissue instead.","This review refers to the 2002 Citadel Records re-issue.If you're a Radio Birdman fan this is the album to have! Unfortunately, when they remastered this in 2002, Rob Youngers's vocals got buried in the mix. It's so bad, that in some places you can't make out what he's singing!Red Eye Records did it right in 1996. If you can find this copy, buy it instead."
4,Poetic way with words,"His voice is raspy, his emotion and sentiment is heartfelt, his words are poetry. I discovered Matthew after hearing one of his songs - ""Return To Me"" playing in the background on a favorite television show.. He reminds me of a combination of other gifted artists - Dylan, Reed and Shawn Mullins. This disc is worth repeated playings.. and grows on you every time."
2,I thought I would use it,This turned out too small. I bought it a few months ago and I havent even used it yet. I was so excited about it but not anymore. It wasn't as pretty as I thought it would be but I decided to keep it anyway. My mistake. Now it collects dust in the corner of my kitchen
1,Poor reception,"These hearing protectors work well at noise reduction, but the radio is awful. It is very difficult to turn on the radio. Once you get it to turn on the reception is terrible. Local radio stations fade in and out while walking around my shop. The unit is useless when mowing the yard; I could only receive one radio station. In the same application my Sony Walkman works well. My solution to listening to the radio while mowing was to use ear buds with my Walkman radio under my regular hearing protectors. I thought this unit would eliminate the cords and ""what to do with the Walkman unit"". I never did get the unit to switch from FM to AM and back. I'll be donating these to Goodwill."
5,Just about perfect,"These fit just what I need: headphone radio that will mute mower sound and let me listen to the radio. I listen to AM. Don't expect stellar AM reception with any radio like this. I have a high quality portable AM radio, and it doesn't do much better. Don't expect to pull things in that are 150 miles away - stick with the local guys - and your expectations will be met. Similarly, don't expect audiophile sound. This is just a nice simple radio in a decent quality headset that will mute outside sound.It is so aggravating to mow with a corded headphones and radio (constantly tangling the cord and shutting off the radio by mistake, etc. Plus they don't block noise like this does.It would be nice to have digital presets, but I've found it easy enough to quickly find my stations. It takes a little getting used to.I love this thing."
1,DO NOT BUY.,Bought for my father-in-law. Does not have good reception at all. Could not tune into stations very well. What a waste of $60. Didn't return becuase s&h costs to return weren't worth it. Just threw it away. What a shame and a waste.
4,Very Quiet,"Great on my riding mower. Listened to Red Sox. Fairly comfortable, but myears were sweaty. I wonder how it will be in the summer. I am pleased with my purchase."
4,Great Product!,This is a pretty lightweight headset. It is easy to manage and the sound is very clear. My only negative is that the headset is difficult to adjust to larger heads. It is a bit more bulky than some but then it does eliminate all external noise!
4,Football and Lawn Work,I received my Worktunes as a gift. At first I had my doubts but it is terrific. I can work all afternoon with noisy lawn equipment and enjoy a ball game. Enjoy them so much I am going to pass the favor forward and get my brother a pair for his birthday.
2,Very comfortable and dampening but radio is average at best,"The best feature about these headphones is the comfort. The big thick ear cushions make you forget you are wearing them. Its sound-dampening ability is also excellent. I can operate my shop-vac with barely noticing the noise. However, the sound quality and radio reception leave a lot to be desired. FM reception is just average, and the AM reception is down right terrible. In addition, there is no tuning dial scale so searching for a station is a real adventure. Great concept, but poor execution."
3,The sound is not stereo,"The overall quality of the product is excellent. The sound is not stereophonic, but otherwise the hearing protector does a great job keeping the noise out."
2,Poor Reception,"I purchased these for use on a farm tractor and a backhoe. They do block a good portion of the noise. However, they have a lot of drawbacks. They do not pull in most of the signals. I live in rural America. The reciever is analog so the FM signals drift. If you turn your head, you will pick-up different FM channels. It also goes through batteries. I turn the head phones off and the next day, the battery is dead. I do know the difference between changing the unit to AM, versus turning it off. Another downside is the lack of a channel indicator. You sort of wonder around the selector trying to find the station you want. I would wait for a better manufacturer or a digital unit."
3,Excellent protection,"These are great hearing protectors.Probably the best I have ever owned.I bought them to listen to the radio,however, and they are sketchy in that regard.The tuning range is very small and AM (my favorite unfortunately)isn't good.FM reception is ok if you tune it carefully."
4,Comfortable and noise reducing -- but radio is a little weak,"This headset does a good job of blocking noise, and for its size, is comfortable to wear. The radio is just mediocre, however, as it is somewhat hard to tune, and somewhat hard to turn on and off -- the same button is used to change from AM to FM AND to turn the radio on and off, depending upon how long you hold the button. It takes a little work to be sure you've turned it off and not just changd bands, and on occasion I've come back later to find that I must have left it on, and run the batteries down. I would suggest having a separate power swtich, and eithr making the tunning knob bigger, or better yet, using a digital tuner. Otherwise, for the price, it's a pretty good deal!"
1,Product failed after 9 months,I received my Peltor WorkTunes for Christmas 2003. I used it a couple times a month.Last time I tried to use it the on/off/volume switch had failed. The warranty is 90 days so if I send it back to the company it will be a non-warranty repair.Cheap junk. I wish I would have gotten a higher-quality item. And digital is not too much to ask in the 21st century.
1,Not good quality,"As soon as I took it out of the box, the backplate on the earmuff was trying to come off. should be fastened better. I immediatly returned them, since I knew they would not last in a working environment.The other bad thing is that there is no radio dial, you cannot tell where you are on the band to find a radio station."
2,SO-SO while it lasted,"I've had them for 2 years, hard to use, weak radio, however it does function as advertised, now it has quit working, just hanging there on its hook. No it is not the batteries, which by the way fall out far to easy. Will I buy another? Not if I can find another brand."
1,Not as advertised,"The only thing the same was the brand and color. The headset they sent had no port to plug in a device such as an Ipod (which is why I bought it in the first place and it is advertised as having one). Also, there is a big sticker on the back of the package warning that the headset cord contains Lead. Now I can't even let my kids use it! False advertising, never again!"
3,Bulky and hot,"Nice unit, fair reception, but the fit is very tight. I find it to be uncomfortable in warmer weather, no room for air circulation."
4,You gotta buy this!,"My husband LOVES his Peltor WorkTunes Hearing Protector. I bought them for him last year for Father's Day, and I swear when he's outside working he won't take them off. He tells me they are very comfortable and the sound protection is excellent, all he hears is the radio (he uses them while cutting the grass, using his chainsaw, and using his power washer, all very noisy for the rest of us.) His only gripe is that the tuning dial is small, and it can be hard to set it to the station you want, though once it's set, it stays there. We bought a pair for his father this year."
4,Generally very good overall,"I have had these for about a year. I use them for woodworking, spray painting in a loud spray booth and cutting my grass. It makes the time go by in a more enjoyable way and protects my hearing at the same time. They are reasonably comfortable and light considering what they do. They are well built and battery life is excellent. My only wish is that they had a digital tuner with presets. They are difficult to tune at times and a pain to switch channels on the fly. So I tend to listen to the same station for extended periods. Overall well worth the money for what they provide."
4,Peltor WorkTunes AM/FM Radio Headset with 22 dB Reduction Hearing Protector #90545,Excellent for yard work!
2,Mr.,"The picture is of the higher priced model,I have paid around $100.00 for the product in the picture, I thought I was getting a real value here. However the item sent would only get a few stations."
4,Lawnmower Headsets,Peltor WorkTunes AM/FM Radio Headset with 22 dB Reduction Hearing Protector #90545I have been using this headset weekly for mowing for four weeks. It has very good noise reduction (The 22 db isolation works). It's only weak feature is that the AM radio signal reception is poor. Maybe it needs an antenna redesign. My last Sony AM/FM headset had little noise reduction but good reception and lasted ten years. I hope the Peltor lasts as long.
1,Not a reliable source of information,"This book is a simplistic, uninformed, biased rant against cremation that purports to shed light on ""Christian truth."" There is absolutely no real scholarship here, no real treatment of the issue. Any book of this caliber, whether it advocated one position or its opposite, is essentially useless for helping anyone who is looking for information and serious scholarship to examine an issue. This is nothing but a polemical tract, not an honest examination of Christian scripture and tradition."
1,misleading book,"Very misleading package. There's a brief Graham Greene story, plus a miscellany of unorganized, sometimes fragmentary, and rarely interesting ephemera from writers you've never heard of. It's almost surely not what you're thinking it is. I'd pass."
4,A Fabulous Read,"I go back and re-read this book all the time. The book is a sampler of excerpts from some of the greatest spy novelists of all time. Many of whom I had not heard of. Of course I read John Buchan's "" 39 Steps "" when I was a boy, but I had never heard of William Le Queux, who is featured several times. However it's edited by Graham Greene, who should know quality when he reads it. His "" Our Man in Havana "" is a beautiful tongue-in-cheek spy novel. I highly recommend this spy sampler, it is very entertaining."
3,Worth reading,"Although most applicable for improving management of a manufacturing concern, this book is worthwhile reading for anyone trying to run their own business better. I am a partner of a small CPA firm, and found several parts that were useful in running my practice better. I read, re-read, and underlined the chapters on job interviewing and employee reviews. Grove's style has obviously been successful for Intel, and this gives his comments tremendous credibility. I appreciated this, as opposed to the myriad of management books written by authors whose track record is unclear, questionable, or non-existent."
1,Grove should stick to writing technical books,"Andy Grove may be an exceptional manager and a superb technologist, but he is NOT an author of business books. If you must read a book by Grove, read his ""Physics and Technology of Semiconductor Devices"" (c. 1968). Trust me, anything he has written since then is downright terrible"
3,Not up to par,"I am a adamant fan of Keely. I've seen her perform three times. I was anticipating this CD with baited breath. I wasn't as impressed with the arrangements as her earlier, especially Jingle Bells. It was flat by her standards. I'm still crazy about Keely though."
5,Glad I They Had This CD,"The CD is great, I have been looking for copy with 'Hello, Hello' on it for years. It came quickly and it is in superior condition. If you like Sopwith Camel you will be satisfied with this CD."
2,Not up to usual high standard for this series,"This title is lacking in content compared to the other Moon Handbooks and is focused on winter sports and shopping. If you are interested in other activities or seasons, you may be dissapointed."
5,A great book....it's simply amazing.,"I actually don`t own this book, but my storyteller does and I borrowed it from him. The story is great, the plot is magnificent. I couldn`t believe what an amazing book this was, so I wanted a copy for me. This is one of the best books available if you really want to know what happened back then. I think this book is a must for Mage storytellers, either Mage:TSC or Mage:TA because it helps you with a different point of view."
4,Great Workout!,"I have the boot camp workouts, and these are a great companion to those workouts. The cardio dvd is only 45 minutes and it's a good all over body workout that really gets you sweating. The total body dvd is owesome for strengthening. It could be a better leg and butt workout, but all and all, I would really recommend it."
3,One workout is good the other not so much,"I own literally every Tae Bo workout and do a minimum of two on a daily basis. I was excited about this set because I would have the chance to use the bands on a new routine. What I found is one workout is good while the other completely misses the mark. Total Body Fat Blaster was a good DVD (not his best) but provided a good solid workout that incorporated the bands well; however Fat Blasting Cardio was probably one of my least favorites of any Tae Bo workout. The moves did not flow well and at times they seem awkward. It looked as if Billy was improvising on various moves leaving some of the crew looking uncoordinated and awkward, especially when it came to combination move, which is exactly how I felt at times. My advice is try Ultimate Bootcamp in his bootcamp series, which is seems this workout was trying to follow that same formula but misses the mark on so many levels. Total Body Fat Blaster = 4.5 stars / Fat Blasting Cardio = 1 star"
5,You're going to feel this workout,I love these workouts. They are a challenge especially if you use the bands. You can use resistance bands that you buy at a department store. Cut off one of the handles and tie a loop at the end for your foot. That's what I do and they work fine. Just make sure you check the bands at the beginning of the workouts.
4,Tae Bo,"I like it, its very good, In my point of view Is a little fast for beginners like me, it is hard to keep up with the fast movements but with 3 or 4 days of trying it becomes easier, but above all its a good exercise and it feels very good the next day."
3,No Surprise - Great Workout,"I have loved all of the tae-bo workouts I've done, and this DVD set is no exception. My only complaint is the group in the background counting down CONSTANTLY. Seriously, through out the entire DVD, they do not stop counting. I've never taken a class in person, or seen another DVD where this is done, and I find it to be very distracting and extremely annoying!!"
1,Hugely disappointing!,"I am a big fan of Billy Blank's TaeBo workout DVD's and have about 7 different ones to date. I wanted to add these to my collection as they use the Billy Bands - I was extremely annoyed and disappointed to discover that the DVD's sent to me are only viewable in Region 1 (UK is region 2) - No mention was made of this in the description, so I had (wrongly) assumed they would be viewable as are my others. I am currently trying to see if I am able to unlock my DVD player (no success yet) otherwise I will have to wait until I replace my player for a universal one and just imagine how great these workouts are until then.Billy Blanks' Tae Bo: Fat Blasting Cardio & Total Body Fat Blaster"
1,Country code 1 instead of all or code 2,"Hi,Unfortunately I can't use the two DVD's, why the code 1 is not compatible with Europe. The others DVD's that I bought are working well. The code should be for ""all"" or number ""2"". What can' I do? It is possible to sent the two DVD's back?Thanks for you feedback.Best regardsClaudia Ghanemclaudia.ghanem@skandia.ch"
5,I Luv It!!!!,"I read many reviews as I always do before I purchase. This is my fourth taebo video I've ordered in 2 weeks. This is by far the best. Even though I was not able to purchase the taebo bands, I was sweating like no other and I play on four soccer teams and these two videos still kicked my butt. All I have to say is try for yourself. :)"
4,Walking is the way to see this city,"I didn't bring this book along on my Netherlands trip. A friend did, and popped it out while we were in Den Haag. The Den Haag walk was great, crisscrossing the center of the city to show off the history and architecture. The walk snapped the city into focus for me, where it had before been just a blurred maze viewed from a tram.My friend left this book with me when I went on to Amsterdam and he to Germany, and I am so happy he did. I used it every day to give shape to my meanderings across Amsterdam. It's a compact city. You can walk anywhere if you're willing to spend the time, and I recommend you do. Slow down and spend the day ambling along the Herengracht with this book."
2,Novel,"I was not very impressed with the publishing of this book. There were many typos and issues involving supposed screen prints that could not be adequately viewed.The book was actually written as a novel and not actual incidents. With the number of true incidents occurring or that have occurred, using such incidents would have been much more useful."
2,Where's the beef?,"Well, this book *sounded* great. In fact, after taking a look at it I wondered if I'd received the correct item. For this price I'd expect more content. Instead, it's a bunch of stories. That's fine, and for maybe 15 bucks I'd buy it for airplane reading.To be fair, it's advertised as supposedly fictional accounts. I guess I was just hoping that there was something meaty here. (Get it? Where's the beef? Hee hee.)Spend your money on some of the classics instead, unless you're one of the few with disposable income."
4,Very good but...,"I loved this book, but the pictures at the first chapter, with a linux box screen running telnet session, is very little and dark, I can`t read the text inside de screen... is impossible to see what is writted in it... it is blur, the black ink invaded the letters."
4,Entertaining and Interesting,"While this is not the best book for an introduction into the technical issues surrounding hacking, it is an entertaining approach to some of the issues. The book is not meant to be an instruction course for hacking but rather just some fun stories about hacking. No, the stories didn't actually happen, but most of them could, possibly with a little stretching. I like the book and I think it's a lot of fun to read."
4,Not to bad.,"Overall I enjoyed this book. I felt it was a good read and although some of the ""hacks"" were hard to beleive on a technical level. It did get me thinking. I was entertained throughout and I would recommend this book to other IT or security professionals."
5,Must-have for network admins,"Stealing the Network is a collection of short fictional stories, all involving hacking to some degree. They vary in the technical detail of the writing, as well as the situations. Some are white-hat, others black-hat, but all revolve around the theme of bypassing computer security. All give you a good insight into the mind of the hacker.If your biggest fear is waking up to find a stranger owns your box, this is the book for you. It won't guarentee 100% security, but at least the hacker won't be a complete stranger anymore."
4,Fun for all,"This is a entertaining peek into the mindset of hackers. It's definitely not a ""how-to"" manual to exploiting a system, but it gives you a great overview of the steps involved. Everyone from system administrators to curious home computer users should read this book. Not only will you learn a few things about how you should be securing your (or your employer's) valuables, but you will have a few good laughs as well."
2,Interesting Read Maybe HardCopy Would Be better,"This was an interesting read and very technical. The reason I did not like it is because their are many screen shots on the Kindle version(that I read on my iPad) and not a single one of them is readable. I do not know if you can actual see these screen shots in the paper version, but if you are going to make your book availible in Kindle you need to ensure that it is just as good as the paper in quality and ALL pictures and screenshots are readable. I would of given it 1 star but the actual book itself I enjoyed."
3,"Dunno about the CD, but they ripped off The Who","They ripped off The Who's song ""Behind Blue Eyes"". The Who did a much better job with that song, and if you think that Limp Bizkit is a genius for that song, you are dumb. Get The Who's version and enjoy it instead."
5,ring,"found a ring that would fit my little finger, and it looks so gooood on my little finger. its rare that you find half sizes, in ready made jewerly."
1,Unhappy customer,"I was very unhappy when I received this ring. I have small fingers. This ring is so tiny - unlike the online image.I am a marcasite lover, but would not recommend this ring at all."
4,very sweet,"This ring is very nice and looks very expensive. I wear my ring on a daily basis, however, you must be careful because one of my stones fell out. But you can't tell, and it is beautiful."
5,great find!,The ring is very pretty & looks expensive... I was so excited it came in a size 4!!! The fit was right. It also came in a cute little container with a bow on top... If you are sending this as a gift that is a nice bonus. I am very pleased.
5,Ring I enjoy very much,"I enjoy this ring very much, however, I wish that I had ordered a larger size. I think that I would have like it a lot better as a middle finger ring. Just the same I really like this ring."
3,"Like it, but it snags on things","The ring looks great. I really like it, but when I dry my hands on a towel, it snags. If I brush against the couch, it snags the threads. I read all the other reviews before buying mine, but no one else seems to have the same problem - maybe I got the lemon? I still wear it everyday, just wish it wouldn't snag on everything."
4,"Happy, but...","Love the ring, but unfortunately the stones protrude a bit so they can easily get caught on things. Girlfriend has had the ring for a while now, and two of the tiny rocks have fallen out.All things consider (especially the price), I am very happy with the ring."
3,A good reference book that shows much love of the subject.,"This is a fan love letter to Peter Cushing. As such it is, perhaps, beyond criticising. It contains an obsesive amount of material on Mr. Cushing and others involved in the old Hammer films. Despite it's fan perspective, it manages to give fair critical readings of his movies. Be warned, the book is pricey for what you get. If you are a rabid Cushing fan, however, or a genre fan with deep pockets, this book is recommended."
5,GREAT COLLECTION,"IF YOU'RE A GLADYS KNIGHT FAN,YOU HAVE TO GET THIS CD.IT PUTS TOGETHER SOME GREAT FAMILIAR SONGS ALONG WITH SOME ALOT OF US HAVEN'T HEARD BEFORE.FROM START TO FINISH IT'S A GREAT LISTEN.THERE IS NOTHING ELSE LIKE HER VOICE WHEN SHE'S SINGING GREAT MATERIAL.THE ONLY SONG I WISH THEY HAD INCLUDED IS ""NEITHER ONE OF US"".OHTER THAN THAT IT'S A GREAT COLLECTION EVEN IF YOU HAVE ALOT OF HER OTHER STUFF."
5,Gladys never lets you down,"I have been a Gladys Knight fan for as long as I can remember. Besides being a 'Lady' in how she has conducted her career in the music business, she continues to provide, beautiful, quality music throughout the years. This CD is a joy to listen to if you love Gladys."
5,psaltery bow,I am very pleased with my 2 new bows. They were exactly as described in the ad and even nicer than I expected!! iI bought two so I can learn how to play harmony while playing the melody.
5,Exactly as expected!,"Exactly as expected....the product arrived on time, packaging was good, and it worked just as advertised. I would recommend this bow...."
3,An Artist in the Making,"This is the most unusual western of them all. A ""spaghetti"" western from 1967 written and directed by Lina Wertmuller who would go on to international acclaim with ""Love & Anarchy,"" ""Swept Away"" and ""Seven Beauties"" for which she became the first woman to be nominated for a Best Director Oscar. In ""Belle Starr"" (terrible transfer, terrible dubbing) you can see where she was coming from and where she was going. With little or no understanding of the American west or its myth, or even a knowledge of the western film genre, Lina's Belle Starr comes to the old west from a fashion layout in 1966. Then Lina tells the story of men and women (and guns) in very much the same way she would in subsequent films. Make no mistake, this is not ""The Wild Bunch"" or ""The Searchers"" but it compares favorably to any of the slew of European westerns from the 60's except those by Sergio Leone. For fans of Lina Wertmuller, this film is a must-see."
3,Fine,"I got these binoculars thinking they would be awesome and great. I love that thet are very strong exept the picture/video taking is horrible. I normally just use these for normal binoculars because of that. Its hard to download on the computer, Its hard to find the right memory chip that fits in it, and after you get to finally see your pictures and video you realize that the quality is horrible. =( I still like it though. =D"
1,Useless product,New out of box would not turn on. Tried several different batteries. Junk . Do not waste your your time and money
2,disappointed,"You need optimal conditions for the pictures to come out clear, not any better than using a regular 35mm camera"
4,only one,"could not find much on the subject so sprung for this book, glad i did,need more info but this is a good start!!!"
4,Historic Ballroom and very danceable,"These are historic ballroom tracks and very danceable. The recording volume level seems a little weak. Tracks 7 and 8 are mislabeled on the case as waltzes. This is all swing or jive, foxtrot, and quickstep.There is little crossover between this and the following four VSO albums: Dancing on my Heart, Strictly Ballroom, Ballroom Dancing, and Marvellous. A good value for $10."
5,Knock-out,"This album is a total knock-out. What a duo, what an era, what care in swinging and entertaining, and great selection of material. Spanned the popular culture without patronizing anyone. Keely is in phenomenal voice here and Louis and the band swing. The arrangements go through shuffle, swing, Latin and Klezmer motifs yet are always hip."
2,Android please,"this volume is like bad. super 17 gave the super vegeta a hard time, Goten and trunks an even hader time. Not even gohan could beat him. even MajUbb, who was just as strong as Super Buu didn't even make 17 budge. yet SS2 Goku just punched 17 and he moved miles and miles with ONE punch.Whats up with that? SS2 Goku is stronger than the merging of Ubb and Buu. Any way 17 was defeated by one dragon fist anmd Goku wasn't even super saiyan!! But the apprerance of #18 was nice and the destruction of dr.Myu was great but those were the only good points to these episodes. even the wrost DBZ episodes were better than this."
4,Great for Toddler Boys!,"I bought this DVD for my 2 year old son. He is ALL BOY and loves trucks, dirt and all the things that go along with them, so this DVD was perfect for him. Now driving in the car has turned into a big game of ""I Spy"""
3,so-so video,"This video isn't what I was expecting. There are two segments on the dvd. The first focuses on farming rather then just tractors. The second part is better. It has three small segments about tractors, trucks, & trains. The only problem is that the tractors part is pretty much redundant of the first tractors video. My son rarely wants to watch this video. The first segment on tractors/farming quickly loses his interest, which is surprising because he LOVES tractors. The second one is better (he'll watch the whole thing) but it's not nearly as good as the Lots & Lots of Trucks video"
2,Ok video.,This video is mostly tractors; few trucks were featured. Music was so-so and production was fairly amateur.
3,Mort the chicken?!?!?!,This game came as a suprise to me but when i read the back it looked pretty neat. This game isn't exactly easy to explain so i won't. I'll just say it was a pretty fun game butit wont be on the top ten list any time soon.
2,too small for a pickup,"If you have a pickup, don't waste your money on this. The problem is they are too short by several inches to go across the window. I installed in my F150. You never want to fully extend these across the window because they won't fold up automatically. To make matters worse, it is fully extended across my window and is 5 inches too short. I took it out of the window and now I have these stupid black clamps in my window. They are securely glued to the window. Why would they offer 25 inches tall but make them too short for the window."
1,Adhesive fails soon after installation,"Purchased as a Christmas gift for my girlfriend. I installed it in April, 2010.The product came with mounting brackets with an adhesive backing.By August, the glue pads that adhere the mounting brackets to the windshield had failed. The pads stuck to the windshield properly, but failed where the factory glued them to the mounting brackets. This is a manufacturing defect that should be covered under the 2-year warranty. Without the brackets, the shade is useless. No email response as yet from Vendor or the Manufacturer, Dash Accessories.Think we'll go back to the Eclipse brand shades. They are at least useable."
4,"Keeps the sun out, stores well","Perfect if you are tired of having a sun shade that creates clutter and gets beaten up in the back of your trunk or on the floor of your car.The knob that connects the left to the right parts broke on mine so I had to replace that with a bolt (details in a response to a comment below).The shade has been working well over over 2 years (as of December 2011). I use it often. It's very unobtrusive--no interference with driving.During the summer of 2011 the tape on the right side came loose. I bought some more tape at a hardware store (15 pound, double-sided tape). It's worked fine since then (about 6 months) and I have plenty more tape to replace those pieces if they wear out."
2,Too short,"I ordered these shades specifically by model to fit my Leisure Travel van, I paid quite a bit for them directly from the supplier. They seem to be designed so they slide under the rear view mirror which means they leave a large gap for the sun and heat to get in both on the top and the bottom and the sides completely negating the purpose for which I need them. also they are hard to pull closed leaving me to worry that they may snap open if one of my dogs hearing something happens to bush against it. great idea but extremely poor fit and poor execution."
2,Moderate quality and it wasn't what I expected.,"I bought this sun shade as a long term investment, but the product I got was far below my expectations. I did not like the fact that the shade did not cover the entire windshield. If I'm going to pay $30, I wanted something that would cover the whole window. Also the cover material was very thin. I could see through the material if there was light on the other side. I'm sure this was necessary to make the shade very thin when folded up but I question its thermal conductivity. There are wires that are in tension which allows the shade to fold up automatically. This mechanism also didn't seem too sturdy and all the reviews about having the retracting wires break were understandable.I ended up returning the item so I didn't try sticking it on the windshield.I ended up buying a cheap $12 round fold-able windshield shade at the local auto store. This one is also thin and quality is far from sturdy but at least its not $30."
2,"Looks nice, but hard to use","After reading through all of the comments here, I cautioned my father about the threads breaking and the knob falling off. We live in AZ and it's almost October here, so the temps aren't as high as they typically are. It kept the inside cooler and looked nice, but it wadded up when we got in the car to go somewhere. We spent quite a bit of time straightening out the pleats while trying to not break the thin nylon string that enables it to fold. We had to actually start the car and turn on the AC because by the time we got it folded back up, the car had become hot. I wouldn't buy this product again."
2,Look Pretty not for Contractors,"Hard to roll uo does not lay flat always a trip hazard. So its clear so do you think you will see the air, Who cares Get Goodyear flex."
1,ez-one,"I can not beleive the high rating these get. I bought one because of the feedback. it arrived damaged (with a hole in it) it kinked easily but it did lay flat. If you want a flat, leaky, kinky hose, I would highly recommend this product. you would do better buying 3 cheap ones."
4,"Useful Guide , Not Perfect","The size made it easy to carry around, and it had enough details and information to prove useful for a 2 or 3 day trip through KL, which is a real gem and interesting city, with its relative prosperity and modernity, mix of cultures and religions, and some interesting sites.The maps are adequate but not stellar and provide little detail out of the key neighborhoods, so it will take a bit to navigate the city, which is not laid out in anything as convenient as a grid. Although the monorail and taxi make it relatively easy to get around the main areas, this guide and its maps will prove less effective for exploring off the beaten path.I haven't seen any great guides for KL, so this ""good enough"" will have to do, and hook up with a local for dining / eating / shopping / exploring more than the standard downtown / Petronas Towers / key tourist sites."
4,Digital Level,"As a developer of commercial properties which must meet Americans with Disabilities criteria, this level permits me to verify the percent slope of handicap parking spots, designated routes and entries to buildings prior to concrete being poured or ashphalt being placed. It can save you literally tens of thousands of dollars in costs to correct out of tolerance slopes when the inspection finds beyond limits and it does so instantly and without having to do mathematical conversions. This type of instrument is a must for anyone who is responsible for development of properties for commercial uses."
5,Best in Business,"I use this blade almost every day on my circular saws at work and haven't found another blade to equal it's durability, straight cutting and stability. I've used diablo blades and dewault blades and many others and I always go back to the Marathon."
3,"Too Long, Hot to wear.",I love the pockets; but it's a little too long (comes down very low) and very hot to wear. Do not wear this if it's not at least cool where you're shooting.
2,"I tried, but failed, to love this","I love early Saints, especially Prehistoric Sounds. So I tracked down the Laughing Clowns to hear more of Ed Kuepper doing the lead-horn instead of lead-guitar rock band thing. And they were good! So I wanted to like this collection of later Kuepper stuff very much, I honestly did, and I tried, and I tried, and I didn't like it, and I put the album aside, and I picked it up again, and I tried some more, I really did, but I just can't help it, when I close my eyes I picture some dreadful country rock from the 90s, something that would play at a Republican barbecue, the most uninteresting crap imaginable, it sounds like musical oatmeal! What happened?!? Oh well, win some lose some I guess. There are a couple really good songs on this three-disc set, but god, did I have to wade through some oatmeal to get to them."
4,Carola - A Childhood Favorite,"When visiting Sweden in 1984 I came across Carola in concert for a local TV broadcast - live! I have been a fan of Carola for many hears playing her cassette ""steg for steg"" many times. Jul I Bethlehem brings her tallents back into my listening favorites as I love listening the Christmas music year round, no matter what country."
4,great product,"Bac-Out has really improved the smell of our dirty cloth diapers while in the pail, as well as the look and smell after washing. However, I am only giving 4 stars as there are still some stubborn stains which persist after using Bac-Out and drying in the sun.I was a little surprised when I received the item to find that it was packed with shredded paper -- very effective, economical, and earth-friendly, but this created a mess of tiny pieces of paper which my baby immediately wanted to play with and eat. It was also taped shut with packing tape, which I worried would make the bottle sticky, but after removing it, the bottle seems fine.Other reviews indicated that the smaller bottles could be damaged upon shipping, so I suppose this is a small price to pay to receive the product intact. It also came in a clearly labeled shipping box which said to keep it upright. I also received the product in a timely manner -- about 3 business days."
4,Green cleaning,"So far I like this product. I use it to clean my cloth diapers and it has worked with getting the smell and stains out. I did have to use it on my carpet once because my son accidentally colored off of his coloring page with a marker and it got the marks up. The only thing I don't like about it is, it says ""great for cleaning cloth diapers"" but it doesn't tell you how much you should be using. Like I said it works great but I don't want to be using more than I have to."
3,PERFECT... except for the cost,"I am allergic to chlorine (truly allergic), so I love that Bac-Out as a chlorine-free bleach alternative. I have used Bac-Out in the past with amazing results. However, I am one of the many Americans who is suffering temporary unemployment due to the economy. $40+ for one gallon is so far out of my price range that I have not been able to use this product for a couple of months. I do realize that it is well worth the money for those who can afford it... but I simply can't afford it right now. I sincerely hope there's a good reason for the high price. I can't, however, guess what that reason could be, so because of the price per gallon, and the inaccessibility caused by the price alone, I can't rate this the 5 stars that it could be worth if it were more affordable."
2,Not worth the money,"Nice scent, great odor eliminator, great degreaser....I am pleased that Bac Out leaves behind a pleasent citrus scent while tackling organic odors and stains. However, don't let the price fool you! This product comes full strength, not concentrated. If you have plans to dilute it to use for general cleaning, in the carpet cleaner, for mopping the floors, or for other uses, you can't. For this reason, the cost of this cleaner is not worth it! I'd much prefer to pay more for a gallon of a concentrated cleaner and dilute it for multiple purposes."
3,What I ordered...,"I was looking for finger puppet books with storylines that we don't already have in our collection. This fit the bill. The artwork isn't really my style, but my LO enjoys it and I have fun reading along in silly troll and goat voices. It's totally retro feeling and was definitely pre-owned, but that doesn't take away the joy of reading together."
5,McGuire Sisters Magic,"This is a wonderful collection of that all female trio, the McGuire Sisters. Beautiful voices in wonderful harmony are the hallmarks of this CD."
4,not greatest hits but fun,"i love the mcguire sisters. these are two very differently themed albums but they are pure joy.great fun highly recommended. just by the way has anyone ever seeen a cd of the fontaine sisters(heart made of stone, 17, etc.)"
5,Jacki Onassis,I had seen this several years ago on the Lifetime channael and had been wanting this for my personal library for a very long time. I always admired Jacqueline Lee Bouvier Kennedy Onassis
5,Cavallo beats Pelu,A much more rock oriented album than the last one definitely. Pelu is beginning to mellow out while his former bandmembers are doing exactly the opposite and digging back to the roots of rock. Litfiba is a great band and you wont go wrong buying this album if you want a fresh modern rock album.
4,"BlackBerry C-S2 Battery for 7100i, 7105t, 7130e, and 8700c Handsets",It worked great. In an unrelated matter the Blackberry stopped functioning soon after I put in the new battery. It's never been able to access internet since so I wasn't able to test the life of the battery.
1,Not New,"First time I receive used batteries... Literaly used, cause one of the few i ordered had a pen written note that said 'USED'. I wrote to seller and no answer."
1,Batteries are refurbished. Die after 2-4 months.,Batteries aren't new. They stop holding a charge after 2-3 months. I wouldn't recommend buying them. Not a quality product.
1,"I was sent a defective used battery, OEM for Cheap is a joke","I have tried to be as patient as a snail going from maine to florida. I just wanted to get a replacement battery. OEM sent me a used battery and then when I called the first time they apologized and told me that I would receive a new battery in about 1 week. Well 3 weeks later I have called them about 8 times and no one will even answer the phone. I wish when Amazon had asked me to survey OEM for Cheap that I would have wrote them. All you folks wanting something from OEM , I advise you to call them and make sure that you will be given the courtesy of knowing that satisfaction is not Guaranteed1-718-338-5459"
1,Joke?,"I got a phone call in response to my earlier comment, this product was not new as stated in the sales info.The caller, a Michael I believe, said this would be rectified, I would be contacted via email. This has not happened. Why bother calling?What a joke.Ann"
1,Battery,Received this battery and it never worked. I noticed that the 'window' on the side was pink which means it was water damaged before I got it and should never have been sold to me. Quite disappointing.
4,Timely and At the right price,"Wow! My Blackbeerry battery arrived in a timely matter and still can't believe I only paid ($3.99 plus shipping) a fraction of the cost that my carrier wanted to charge me for a new one ($40.00)! I was a little hestitant to order because it was such a good price - usually things that are too good to be true, are - but I am happy I did. My phone is working like new. I would order from this company again. It didn't receive 5 stars because the battery was little scratched up but didn't effect function."
5,Blackberry,"Our granddaughter is very happy with the new battery. Her phone is operating very well now, and battery is lasting as long as it should."
3,Poor Quality / subsequently provide good quality product,"Battery appears to be used? Case and contacts showed scratches and wear. Will not hold a charge for more than a few hours on standby. A few minutes when in use. Wasted money!Updated on 10/19. Corrective action taken by seller to remedy problem. Seller provide a replacement battery that is working well. Have had replacement unit for approx 10 days and am pleased with this product and the sellers corrective action. Originally scored as a 1, have upgraded to 3. ( Have spent alot of time on what should have been a simple purchase???)"
2,buy two!!,"I'm glad I bought two!!! One will not hold a charge, so at least half of the order was fine. No bargain, but less expensive than the phone store at the mall.Good luck!!!!"
4,"Shorter life than other batteries, but it works",This battery has a shorter life than other batteries. I find myself running out of juice rather quickly. It is a good batter otherwise.
5,You MUST read this book,"Living in Australia, the violence of racism that occurs in this book doesn't really happen here. But racism will occur anywhere where there is prejudice and ignorance, and this book exemplifies that fact. I thought this was so good i even gave it to my TEACHER to read!"
2,Don't read this if you want to learn about racism.,I was so excited to read about what goes on in a racist person's mind. But this book seriously does not let you know much. It only focuses on one group-The Skinheads. It's just way too boring and way too stupid. And poor Laurel!
2,If you want to be bored...Read this!!!,"The author of Skin Deep is Lois Ruby. I personally did not like this book very much. It was a little immature, but there was a point. The main point was the Skin Heads can make you do things that you wouldn't normally do. Such as, Dan *nicknamed Demon* saw a crime being committed. He saw the Skin Heads beat up a store clerk that was of a different race. Dan didn't know what to do. The Skin Heads saw him and told him not to say anything. After that Dan was brought in to their little group. Even before that Dan was interested in them. At the Mall Crawl Dan, Laurel, and some of their friends saw the Skin Heads. The Skin Heads had all sorts of tatoos. The Skin Heads hate anyone of a different race. This is the reason that I personally didn't like this book. To me, it seemed stupid and in a way a little immature, as I have said. The concept was okay, but the rest was just boring. I like actin and mystery books so that is probably why I didn't like it."
1,Driver problems with Windows 7,"Although another user reported success with Windows 7, I was not so lucky. I had the card working for a bit, but upon restarting the computer, the card was not showing up in my list of ethernet adapters. It still worked but not at gigabit speed. Even when it was showing up in the list, I was not getting gigabit speed. I ended up spending several hours online to find that one must disable IPv6 to get gigabit speed to work. I finally got this changed and thought my problems were solved. Nonetheless, after rebooting my computer a second time, the adapter was again not listed and gigabit speed was lost."
1,Beware this is an ADVERTORIAL Book Only,"HOW ABOUT A LITTLE TRUTH IN ADVERTISING. I just paid for an advertising book. The description RJ Communications gives this book suggests you will learn how to put a children's book together and will gain insight in various areas. However, when you receive the book you quickly realize this is all about how they want you to give them your printing job. BooksJustBooks.com is supposedly a quality symbol of children's books. Everything revolves around sending them your finished illustrated books for printing. And if that was not bad enough they have missing words in their book. Doesn't make you feel that this is the best place to get your book printed when their own books shows such gross errors.Shame on the publishers and printers."
4,Not bad but can use some improvemens,"I like this game alot, I play it everyday, but I am concerned about a few things.First it has great graphics, and gameplay is ok, but it can be more fun with joystick ability.Second, the droning background sound needs to be tuned down so I can enjoy the other sound effects more.But all in all this game is fun as ..., but, it needs PVP capability. Right now I am level 25 now and currently working on getting to 50 or so to see the real fun factor of this game.]I would recommend you buy this game if you like a sci fi genre type rpg.One thing I love is the chat interface, one of the best i have ever seen in a game. Great market ability also, for in game profit!"
2,"In a word - ""slow""","Far too slow of a game. The time necessary to travel place to place make for an amazingly slow experience. If you like the idea of just traveling around the 'computer universe' and exploring then this may be the game for you. The graphics are great and the visuals along the way are exceptional, but if your looking for action, you will find it, but boy do you have to look."
1,Nothing to See Here,"This game gets _incredibly_ boring after 2 months of playing it. It is full of bugs, the developers don't seem to care, and make promises they can't keep. Recently they've added more features that have simply introduced more bugs. This game is an unfinished product and frustrating to play, do not buy this game. I would suggest the upcoming Eve-Online instead if you are looking for a space RPG, it looks much more promising."
4,A pleasure to play Good job Westwood,This game is a pleasure to play. The universe is very big and there are a vast amount of places to explore. You don't have to laser or missle your way around all the time. There is a good balance between trade combat and explore. If you get tired of combating take on some trade route jobs or explore jobs. You are also assigned missions to complete to advance in both overall level combat level trade level and exploreation level.There is a guild system which is a nice feature this enables weaker players to group with stronger ones to finish missions and also fight baddies to combat lvl.Even with the cost of 12 a month it should provide many months of playing for most people.
1,Dont buy this,"Wasn't horrible while it lasted. except for some serious balance issues and lack of content. However this game was canceled. You cant play it anymore the most you will ever get to do is watch the intro so unless you need the box for your collection. I would not buy this and I can't believe they are still allowed to sell this. Want a good spaced based MMO go with EVE Online. It doesn't have much in the way of PVE content, but the PVP contents is expansive and beyond any MMO I have played. With a complete Player based economy and only a small portion of space patroled by npc's. (There are 5000 solar systems to set up shop in so even the npc petroled areas are pretty big) you don't have to be a pirate, but the danger sure makes being a trader more interesting. you really don't like danger. then you can still run missions, trade goods, and mine ore in high security space, but its not nearly as valuable."
5,The Best Game Ever Created,"Earth and Beyond is or was, the best role-playing space explorationgame ever created. But it is gone.The game ended 5 years ago (or is it more now? How time flies when you'restill trying to have fun!) and unless anyone can tell me if the emulator is up,there is no Earth and Beyond.As others have said, it is but an empty box."
2,Not ready for prime-time,"Westwood needed to get this on the shelves before a couple of big hitters hit the stores - most notably Star Wars Galaxies - and it shows. There is the foundation for a decent game here, but its not ready yet. After a couple weeks of play, the game feels 'incomplete'. My hunch that it will take them three months to iron out the service issues (LAG is horrid right now in some popular stations) and then content will follow. By then SWG, AC2, the Sims Online and perhaps even EVE will be eating their lunch. As for me, I'm going back to DAoC until SWG comes out."
1,"Was good, now unplayable, buyer beware!","I loved this game, it was fantastic - ""was"" being the operative word. EA Games took the Earth and Beyond servers offline. As such if you buy this game, you can install the client, but you will not be able to play it: it requires an online connection to the servers to function. So, unless you're waiting for the completion of the fan-made emulator, this game will be absolutely useless. I hope you like boxes that take up space on your shelf, because that's all this is now. I guess you could use the discs as nifty space-themed coasters..."
3,"Great graphics, good interface, fun to play but....","...just not worth the monthy fee. The game sufferes from some pretty bad bouts of lag and once you have seen it all, there isn't much more to do. The missions are fly here, kill that. Go there and talk to this person. Very repetitive.The graphics, however, are beautiful. The different parts of the galaxy are all works of art in their own right. That alone is enough to make someone pay the initial price and a few months of membership. After that, you'll probably move on.I hope star wars galaxies will have more lasting value! :)"
3,Potential,"Probably one of the more annoying points of this game is the tremendous unused potential it has. Players have no ""home"" are must wander endlessly through the galaxy. Long load times inbetween jumps area also annoying.I expect (hope) that as time goes on they will fill in the galaxy. I would really love to have a space that is ""my own"" in the world."
4,"Awesome, but not recommended for everyone","E&B is so awesome. I have played a LOT for 3 days now and i'm already a lvl 30 enforcer and i've still got lots of things to do. In this game you have 3 races, each race has 2 class. Depending on your race and class, u can learn different skills. For example, an Jaquai explorer can rescue destroyed ships with the jumpstart ability. ( My ship got destroyed by aliens and I was far away from a station, luckily an explorer passed by and saved me :-) ) Teamwork is also important and adds the fun. The reason why i dont gave it 5 stars is because the galaxy is so vast, it will take a LONG time to reach an important destination. Also, combat should use more depth, it's almost always the strongest who wins. It's a great game, but not for everyone. If you prefer combat style like tie fighter, then you should wait for Star Wars Galaxies. But if you are a star-trek fan, then this game is for you !"
2,Great game ...until it went live...,"The first patch they nerfed (reduced greatly in power) a ton of classes not to mention making the defenders and traders weak shades of thier former selves. And, this was the FIRST patch. I shudder to think of what is comming down the road.The only thing they seem to be doing is making all the classes weak so they can stay on the god aweful leveling treadmill.In Beta, the game was fun, laid back, and would have made a good single player game. Now they are slowing turning a decent game into the same chore Everquest and Dark Ages of Camelot are.Do not purchase this game. Do not support companies that change your characters defining traits after you have invested weeks into building them only to have the current change midstream....or even dry up completely."
5,A Solid Game!,"This game is a lot of fun, especially the group activities which are very important to the game's design. A huge storyline also adds exitement to the solid gameplay. Many things are available at your disposal inclusing super beams, missile launchers, shields, engines and so on. There are many notable sights to see such as Saturn, Jupiter, Earth, the Moon, Mars, and many others. This game is tryly worth the price!"
4,"Very good, and Getting better with each new Patch","Earth and Beyond is a very solid online role playing game. I've watched the game change considerably for the better over the last few months of beta testing. With each new patch, it seems that more graphical detail is added to the universe, and it's really starting to look quite good. It's also one of the most STABLE online role playing games I've ever played, and it runs very smoothly with no lag and no disconnects...and it's still in beta!!!I just wish there would be some more variety in the Space stations you can visit. Also, they need to make it so you can look at your character from all sides instead of just from behind....I hate staring at my character's back, when I went through all that trouble to make her look so cool!!!Overall though, I have to reccomend Earth and Beyond and based on what I've seen and played so far, it will probably continue to get better..."
2,No Pvp?!?!?!? What were they thinking?,"In beta this game was great because it had PvP in it, but when there were a few weeks left of beta, they took out PvP. Yes the PvP system was super buggy in beta but instead of trying to fix it they became lazy and just took it out which was a very bad mistake. No PvP means a boring game once you reach the highest level cause there really is nothing left to do other than kill monsters, trade, and talk to other players which easily gets boring. If you have love for PvP like me then get Asheron's Call 2 or Dark Age of Camelot though those games aren't futuristic like this one, they have extremely good PvP. If you only want to play futuristic MMORPGs then wait for Star Wars Galaxies to come out. It's funny if how they just left PvP in this game then I would have rated it 5 stars, sadly they [messed] up because of their laziness. This is all I had to say."
2,"At this moment, not very good","Sorry, but this game is not very complete even with the latest patchI waited for the latest patch that was supposed to save this game and it just didnt pan out. Its a boring, tedious online game that has none of the emotion or character of EQ, DAOC and AO. It's fanbase is woefully inadequate and full of griefers and whiners that PVP should be allowed, while the majority of the content suffers due to a nazi like PVP following.Pass on this one now, as most people playing it are simply waiting for Eve or Star Wars anyway."
1,No Longer Playable,"This game has been unplayable for five years now. I am aghast at why this is still for sale when it cannot be played. Is there really such a thing as a ""GAME COLLECTOR"" who would be interested in making the game a part of some grand collection?And just for clarity, there is no single player mode and no way to host your own mini-universe for it.Again, not sure why it is still being sold when it cannot be played and why the sellers are not noting this in their product pages. Here is a quote from one of the vendors ""PC Game complete in box with all contents - cds are in great shape and play great..."" Hmm.. CDs play great eh? How?Sorry for being so down on this, it is not my style to be rude, but I have been burned four times now with ONLINE UNIVERSE games that sellers failed to mention could no longer be played.Hail Flavius!"
2,"Great for a week or so, but gets old fast","Being one of the beta testers for the game, I had already known pretty much what to expect when I bought it. It was bland, the missions were redundant, and it took way too much time to travel from one end of a sector to the other. However, I bought it thinking that Westwood was going to add new content every month.And so they did, but the content came only in little trickles and it hardly ever changed the game. Missions remained static, plot lines only slowly emerged over a matter of months, and actual help from the game masters was nonexistent. For the first month, this is a great game, if just for the novelty of playing a space trading game with real people. But it's not worth paying a monthly subscription for."
5,"I don't like this game, I'm ADDICTED TO IT =o)","I've played like a month, and I'm already showing signs of dependency. Things like going to bed at 4:30 a.m and all that.The Jenquarum, the Sha'ha'dem, progen, trade routes, combat with 8 eyed monsters from outer space. I'm gonna need professional help in another month, but i'm having fun like never =o)"
5,Addict game,"This is a wounderful game, lot of caracter and mission. But we have to pay monthly, this is the only bad things. If it dont care to pay each month, it's a must-have game"
4,"Thor's Hammer - 'From Keflavik, With Love' (Big Beat)","Very nice twenty track compilation, from this garage / freakbeat band that came out of Iceland. The tunes here were penned between 1965-67. Wasn't able to find out that much info about the band except that after Thor's Hammer had disbanded, the guys formed Trubrot - who apparently put out two lp's before calling it a day. Thor's Hammer repertoire had several well-written rockers along with a few meaningful ballads. Tunes like ""I Don't Care"", ""Better Days"", ""My Life"" and ""Show Me You Like Me"" make 'From Keflavik, With Love' more than worthy of repeated plays. Line-up: Erlingur Bjornsson and Gunnar Poroarson - guitars & vocals, Runar Juliusson - bass & vocals, Engilbert Jensen - drums & vocals and Petur Ostlund - drums. Should appeal to fans of The Eyes, early Who, Kinks, Pretty Things and The Action. Do check it out."
2,"""Lady and the Trampy"" food!","Paula Deen can't cook! A better book is ""Mama Dip's Kitchen"". It is real southern style cooking-Mildred ""Dip"" Council has been cooking all of her life and knows what she is doing?"
4,"If you love Southern cooking, you'll get alot of use from this book.","The only reason I didn't give this book 5 stars is because there are no pictures, and I love pictures in a cookbook. But that's just me. Otherwise, this is a very interesting and useful cook book. The cooking tips at the end are appreciated, too. I am an avid cook, plain country cooking-not gourmet- and I didn't know ""to keep unused egg yolks fresh for future use, place in bowl and cover with 2 tablespoons of oil"" to keep them fresh for 4 or 5 days!If you like to cook and you like the Southern (I'm a Texan)style, you'll enjoy this book. If you haven't already seen Paula Deen on the food channel, take a look, you'll want the book."
5,Ya'll are gonna love it!,"I got this cookbook a while back from Amazon, and read it cover to cover. Made the famous ooey gooey butter cakes, and they are good and probably need to be called bar desserts, as it is not really a cake.We visited her famous restaurant in Savannah last week after a drive from Florida, and must say it was worth the detour off of I95. The fried chicken, collards , hoecakes and biscuits were great. as was her chocolate cake and banana pudding.This is a fun book and if you love Paula Deen , you will enoy it . You can almost hear her talking the way she does on her show. I love how she says Oil and Boil, also the way she takes a big old fat bite of her food and closes her eyes and you can almost taste it!"
2,Wanted to love it but...,"I have gone to culinary school and have been a home chef for 15 years. As much as I wanted to love this cookbook and the lovely, charming Paula, I was really disappointed. I found the ratios of ingredients really off and wondered if they actually hadn't made a mistake with some of the recipes. There are good points if you fiddle with the recipes- especially the banana pudding. If you're still dying to buy this cookbook, I'd see if I could find it used since there are few pictures anyway. But when there are so many cookbooks with recipes that work, why buy this one?"
2,No photos,"I am actually a cook that if something looks pleasing to the eye, I will try and cook it. I bought a bunch of cookbooks and didn't read the summary description of those books so when I received this book, I was so disappointed to find out that there were no pictures of the recipes. I will not return it because the shipping cost is the same as the cookbook price so I will probably just donate this book back to the library."
4,NICE GIFTS,We purchased these to give as presents and the recepients were so pleased at the quality of the product. (and we were pleased at the price!)
2,"Charming read, would make a good movie, but can she cook?","Oh yeah, the intro by that Midnight author guy is in here. Yippee! For fans of his, this may be the only reason to buy this book, so I'm giving it 2 stars for that. I have to wonder if all these recipes even tested. I 've heard her cafe is actually good, but I cooked about 10 of the recipes in the book and they all were dissapointing. I almost felt ripped off. Don't waste your money. If you want to cook great southern food, try out True Grits or A Gracious Plenty - much better than this."
2,Was not what I expected.,"I chose to buy this book because it had such good reviews from other (...) customers. When I finally received it, I tried my first recipe-The Lady's Cheesy Mac-and was very disappointed. I put the eggs in just like it said and everything just curdled. So instead of having a smooth cheesy consitancy, I had macaroni in a chunky-eggy sauce. It was a failure and I wasted a lot of good cheese on it. But I decided to try another recipe in the book, The Cheese Buscuits. And they turned out better. Because of that I have given it 2 stars."
5,This is my favorite cookbook!,"Paula Deen's cookbook is one of my favorites. The food represents wonderful Southern cooking. My personal favorites are the gooey butter cake, Savannah crab cakes, a cold broccoli salad that would be perfect for potlucks, and a very hearty potato casserole with sour cream, cheese, and bacon in it. The recipes are very manageable and they don't take forever to prepare. Many of the dishes are served in her Savannah restaurant. I highly recommend this cookbook!"
3,Paula Deen...Unhealthy but Tasty,"Great southern recipes in this book. Nothing in this book is even remotely ""healthy"" though, this is old fashioned southern comfort food"
4,Jane's Krazy Mixed Up Salt,"In reference to the review by BMarold below, Jane's Krazy Mixed Up Salt mentioned in this book is a salt blend sold at regular grocery stores in the south. Maybe it is not carried everywhere. In case you want to get some, here is the info on the manufacturer:Flavor Delite, Inc578B L&C; Distribution ParkRichburg, SC 297291-800-257-6174, ext 164"
3,"Fred Kolias, Mt. Kolias' Reviews, NJ","There is good writing here, beginning with the leadoff track ""Starting Over Again"". Other noteworthy highlights include the subtle, but catchy ""The Groove Song"" and the innovative ""Hear Me"". Trends in music have been said to run in 20 year cycles, which could only benefit Jason Gonzalez"
4,Cake contiues to refine and improve their sound,If it aint broke dont fix it the saying goes. Cake has been playing the same style of music for over 10 years now and it works well for them. This album is the best refining of their sound yet. I cant say it is their best ever...I think Prolonging the Magic has that Honor. This album gives a good representation of their sound and how varied it can be. If you like Cake you will like this album. You need this!!
4,A Gem of a CD,"I do not have a deep knowledge of Cake music, although my musical prowess in general is quite expansive. However, from the second this CD qued up I sensed it was something special. Obviously at least some long term Cake fans feel otherwise. I do alot of listening on my daily drive to work and almost never find myself keeping one CD in constant heavy rotation - - just too much music out there to listen too ! However, with this CD I found myself listening to it 3-4 times in a row and coming back to it shortly thereafter (Yes I know its fairly short by today's standards.) Point is, I now want to dig deeper into Cake. As has been stated in other reviews, this CD's production value is top notch and even with the smatering of electronica, every instrument is clearly dicernable, while at the same time melding together comfortably. In short, a fine piece of work which makes me feel good - - taken from someone who generally relishes the ""darker side"" of musical composition."
4,Nice job Cake,I love all of the other albums Cake has put out and I do like this one. I was a bit disappointed with the abundant synthesizers because I've never known Cake do use them this much. I think they could have traded some synthesizer for some more trumpet! I also love Cake's witty lyrics and they were definetly on this CD.
3,Cake with no reason to celebrate,"I gave this cd a listen from my Digital Locker and there is nothing on here that stands out to me as being really good. All of the songs have that distinctive Cake sound, but to me there are no hidden gems, a la Sheep Go To Heaven.I've been a fan since Fashion Nugget came out and this cd gives me the fewest reasons to listen to it over and over.On the plus side, I do think that it's better than anything else on the radio these days, which has to be worth something, right?"
3,"even CAKE can have a slump, it seems","Don't get me wrong - this is way better than much of the dreck that passes for pop music these days - but IMO this album is a definite step back. It seems to lack the biting wit and irrepressible sense of, well, FUN on the other Cake albums. And the emphasis on synthesizers coupled with mixing the drums too low gives it less of a R'n'R feel than I prefer from the lads. Perhaps John has a wee case of writer's block...35 minutes of music including the bizarre choice to cover a Bread tune (the cover of the Kenny Rogers song on the bonus CD I got is actually much more compelling in a tongue-in-cheek way). Perhaps this will grow on me after a few more listens, but I'd definitely steer new listeners to ""Motorcade..."", ""Prolonging..."" and the other superb albums first."
5,What's not to like?,"It's another likeable sing-along-able endlessly-listenable CD from the guys. My CD has a sticker on it that says ""Contains the Hit No Phone"" which is fun but but I like much better Take it All Away, Waiting, and End of the Movie. It's pop poetry. This is music baby boomers will like, their college-aged kids will like, and the kid brother will like too - everybody likes it. What's not to like?"
4,"Genuine Cake, only better...","Pressure Chief is Cake's tightest offering yet. The format's the same: the minimalist arrangements, clever turns of phrase, the subtle Tex-Mex guitar riffs and percussion, yet there's something different. It's in the production; their sound is almost slightly polished this time, but the shine doesn't take away from the substance. ""No Phone,"" ""Dime"" and ""End of the Movie"" are classic Cake, while ""Wheels"" is a rather slinky departure from form but not content. And ""Carbon Monoxide"" is just plain fun. All in all, it won't change your world, but it'll make you smile."
2,Say it ain't so...,"I must be an old school Cake fan, and time stands still for me; but I thought I would never see the day where the band would change to the point I wouldn't buy, listen and assimilate the new record.I bought the record, popped it in and didn't listen to it for a month after the first. I returned to the record thinking, ""what could be different this time around?"" No precussion and no Trumpet, the backbone of the band, I guess. Because after the second time I listened to it, I noticed it more than anything else. I am crushed, but I will get over it, just don't ask me today, or tomorrow...."
3,Meh... but okay,"I personally thought this album was a bit on the boring side. Don't get me wrong, I love Cake with all my heart, but these songs didn't spark my interest as much as their others. The first three tracks are the best in my opinion. ""Wheels"" being my favorite, and the other two were also quite catchy. All the rest, unfortunately, were either slow or overly-vibraslapped. Although ""Guitar Man"" is a good depressio song, I just can't relate to the rest of them. Sorry, Cake. Better luck next time!"
4,Almost Brilliant,"Cake is my favorite band, so I am biased. That said, I think I'm being fair when I say that the album is very good, almost incredible.I get the feeling that the band (or John) was a bit rushed when making this album. Sometimes the lyrics seem a bit sparse or weak or at other times just repeat way too much.I wish they would take a lesson from Pink Floyd and slow it down; let the music groove for a bit longer and say what they really mean to say.Now despite my criticism I think that they still have unbelievable talent when it comes to song writing and performing. This is a must have album if you have liked their past stuff, especially Comfort Eagle. Best track in my opinion is ""Take It All Away"" (if you want to, say, download a sample)."
5,Best CD in years,"Can't say I am a huge Cake fan, but the latest CD is the best I have heard in years, PERIOD!From start to finish it is a masterpiece. It's been years since I have heard a fresh new sound like the latest CD.All you Cake fans that can't handle the new stuff would probably be just as disappointed if they rehashed the same old stuff like every other artist out there today. It's good to hear something a bit different every now and then."
4,too much too much too much,"yeah yeah great cake. 36 minutes? that's a record even for you slackers. throw out 'carbon monoxide' and 'hang the baskets' and you have half an hour of a smokin longplayer. you don't think i fork out 13 quid for that, do you fellas?"
5,Mellowing with Age? Well Sort of....,"This latest Cake album shows them mellowing with age, but still maintaining the edge that brought them into the spotlight. Once again - they eschew real drums for the drum machine - which brings a more electronic steady beat to their music. Yet on this album (unlike Comfort Eagle), it works because there's additional electronic elements. You really hear that on tracks like ""Palm Of Your Hand"" - which trails off in new-wave-esque electronica that sounds more retro then new. But the band really shines on songs like ""No Phone"", ""Wheels"" and ""Guitar Man."" Every track on this CD is a gem. And if you're not singing along with the curses in ""Carbon Monoxide"" - you must not be human. Suck it in - this album is their best since Prolonging the Magic."
2,a real letdown,not horrible but it does not compare to their previous work. the music is not as good and the lyrics are bad
1,Imploded Cake,"Like the last Cake effort, Comfort Eagle, the original members really made the band what it was and now they are gone, except the singer. The result is insipid and lacks the spark, charm and vibe of the early collaborations. The singer needs to find some new members that have some kind of aesthetic discernment and can play because it is lacking herein. I would suggest listening to the first CDs, excluding ""Comfort Eagle"" instead.Unless one has no ears or taste, the difference is apparent."
2,boop boop boop boop boop,"Ummmm yeah...a bit too much with the synthesizers. I can't even listen to Dime. I've never had to skip a Cake song before. I absolutely love love love Cake, but this album is not Cake as we know them. They poke through in songs like 'Wheels' and 'End of the Movie' which are both amazing (especially since McCrea finally sings -- wow!) and make the album worth buying, but guys, c'mon, please drop the synthesizer and step slowly away."
1,Cake at its worst,"This CD sucks. No matter how manty times I listen to it, I cant find anything to like about it."
4,Well Done.,"As I sit here listening to the CD for my second time through I must say Cake has done a good job. I am slightly disappointed to see Cake continue there heavy reliance on background electronic beats that was seen on Comfort Eagle. While electronic effects were a great enhancement to some of their older CDs, their recent dominance tends to reduce the overall quality of the soundtrack. Aside from that though Cake continues to dazzle all with their playful lyrics."
4,Pressure Chief - More Good Stuff from Cake,"Another excellent effort from the boys of Sacramento. Nice to see them bring back a little country twang and swang that was missing on their last CD (Comfort Eagle). Cover of Guitar Man is great, and I can't believe it did not garner radio play. This CD has many elements of Fashion Nugget and Prolonging the Magic type songs and will not dissappoint Cake fans at all."
3,A disappointingly mediocre album,"I am a diehard Cake fan, but I was disappointed that this album was so hit-or-miss. After Comfort Eagle's outstanding and catchy songs, I was hoping for a stronger release. Don't get me wrong, there are some awesome songs on here--""No Phone"" and ""Wheels,"" of course, but also a few surprises. ""Guitar Man,"" for example, is surprisingly catchy after a few listens. But about half the songs on this album aren't worth listening to more than once or twice."
4,This Cake tastes funny,"I love Cake. Every single album is awesome...except this one. I like it and it is growing on me, but the grooves are a little low key and the angry, rough music and disjointed lyrics of previous discs are, to borrow a song title, Never There. These songs don't really hit the greatness of the classic Fashion Nugget and the recent Comfort Eagle. There is just a little too much synth here for my taste and really not enough trumpet. Also, at times the trumpet seems a little, well, canned? Like it is synthesized as well? Maybe not. Definitely a must for the die-hard Cake fans, but if you are just getting into John and the boys, definitely listen from the beginning starting with Motorcade of Generosity. Highlights of Pressure Chief: the 70s remake of The Guitar Man. I never liked that song till now. The End of the Movie is a great minute-long moody number. And finally, Waiting and Dime are classic Cake. Recommended."
3,Well....it's okay,"Being a fan of Cake since the inception, I remember being really excited to hear about this release. Sadly, it's the worst of the albums thus far. There are only a few songs on here I didn't get bored of after the 2nd or 3rd listen, those being ""Wheels"", ""Carbon Monoxide,"" and ""Waiting""....but those 3 songs are among my favorites, making this cd all the more frustrating. I mean, who wants to keep hitting the skip button for 3 songs?If you're new to Cake, I'd highly recommend Fashion Nugget or Prolonging the Magic instead of this. If you've already got those and are looking for more, this isn't the worst you could possibly do, but it's the worst Cake album out there."
2,Competent but continues to dumb-down with polish,"2 1/2Their continuation of a more pop oriented, keyboard-driven, easy going snazziness is not as bad as it could be, but I understand why some fans of the band have become disappointed. Starting relatively strong, the album eventually dwindles into auto-piloted bounce, albeit with some still feint sings of the band's trademark lyrical and white-funk skill."
3,Chair Dancing -- Quite a workout,"Jodi Stolove's Chair Dancing Around the WorldJodi Stolove's Chair Dancing Through the DecadesJodi Stolove's Chair DancingInjuries may keep you off your feet. But with Chair Dancing you can still get plenty of exercise. I've purchased three of the Chair Dancing DvDs. They provide fun, interesting exercise that can be done sitting or standing. The 35 - 45 min sessions provide warm-up, work-out and cool-down and allow for differing fitness levels.These programs provide aerobic and coordination exercise, not strength training."
4,This is a fine exercise video,"I used this video when I had a broken leg. The music is fun, the paper plate idea is fun. It's a good way to get moving when not able to be on foot. I would recommend alternating it with other seated-style exercise videos to keep the music and exercises fresh."
3,"First rate for what it is, but not much swing.","Louis Prima and Keely Smith are great singers, and they are great together, and this CD contains some real classic material. But if you are looking for ""Jump, Jive, and Wail"" or anything else in a ""high energy swing"" style, you will have to look elsewhere. I think of this as pop music. Pleasant, and very well done, but nothing that will knock your socks off."
4,Good mirror,My daughter loves this mirror and we keep it in the car for long trips. She doesn't care as much about the design on the back. The only problem I have with it is that the strings are not long enough to attach it to the seat so she can look into it without us holding it.
4,Try Tracking,Great book for beginners(like me)on starting a puppy to track. It makes it easy to get interested in an activity for all dog owners.
2,only if you have a club and competition,"usefull no doubt for people who want in to the competition-thing, but no use for peolple who just want to teach their dog to track things and people for fun"
5,Awesome!,"I loved this recording! I've seen the band several times live, and this record totally captures the energy of the live show. The lyrics are fascinating, the production is superb. A great addition to any collection. There are so many genres on this record--there is a song for every taste. My favorite song is ""Make it be mine"" --it's breathtaking!"
1,Annoying!,"The most annoying thing is the volume -- it comes on at the same volume, regardless of the volume you were listening at the last time you used it. You then need to adjust it each time. And even more annoying, the volume up and down are two separate, and hard to find buttons, which make it louder or quieter in preset increments. It gives you very little control, and even the lowest volume is quite loud, so I can't get it as quiet as I want it.Really poorly designed. Don't buy it."
4,Upholds Mosaic authorship of Deuteronomy,"This is a very good conservative commentary on Deuteronomy.Merrill's introduction includes a spirited defense of the traditional 1447/1446 B.C. date for the Exodus and the Mosaic authorship of the Pentateuch. Some other noteworthy features include: (1) Development of the idea that the Decalogue provides the overall organizing principle for the arrangement of the detailed covenant stipulations of Deut. 12-26; (2) Detailed discussion of Deuteronomy as a ""covenant renewal"" document structured along the lines of Hittite suzerain-vassal treaties of the second millennium B.C.; (3) Footnotes on virtually every page point the reader to the scholarly literature on Deuteronomy up to 1994."
4,Microsoft Office 2004 for Mac OS 10 Visual QuickStart Guide,"This books makes learning the workings of Microsoft Office 2004 super easy. The photos and instructions take the reader step-by-step through the inner workings of the program. A must for the beginner and a resource for the experienced user. Learn Word, Excel and PowerPoint, as well as Entourage and more by using this guide any way you wish."
2,could be better,"not too useful. Could have figured out a lot of this stuff on my own. Actually, I already did. I was hoping for something more like the ""dummies"" books."
1,This Does Not Contain Club Med Songs,"Don't buy this if you're seeking the traditional Club Med songs. I don't know what this stuff is, but it's barely even music."
5,Urban Flamenco with passion,Wow! This the best CD coming from Spain in the last 20 years!!This woman can sing and make you feel. The guitars are great too.
2,Much of the same....,"As my title states, nothing new with this album that you cannot find in on some other album somewhere. Alot of very generic music, cheezy lyrics and some impossibly difficult to understand singing.Do not get me wrong; I like Heavenly, I loved Dust to Dust, it melded together to create a very well told story, good music and some fun songs. Virus, however, does not do that. There are 2 songs on the album which are good. Wasted Time and When The Rain Begins to Fall. The ladder is something a bit more experimental for them, but overall, the combonation between Sotto and the female vocalist works well.The rest of the album is hooky; yes, some songs like Dark Memories and Liberty are catchy, but they are nothing new; Virus, Power and fury, Bravery in the Field, Spill Blood on Fire are all rehashed from other groups, and it all sounds very bland and generic.IMO, heavenly took a major step backwards with this album; Dust to Dust was a solid release, and virus is a big disappointment."
2,Just Okay...,"I bought this for my dad as a Christmas gift, which did arrive late. It took forever to ship and get to my house and arrived on the very last day that was estimated for delivery. When I got the hitch out of the box I was disappointed to say the least. The hitch did have the colors of the photo but, it came in a package that looked like the hitch part wasn't even attatched to the Ford sign. It looked incredably cheap and I was almost embarrassed to give it to my dad. Since it was so late I had to suck it up and do it anyway. I hope it holds up because my guess is it will only last about a month."
3,Acceptable Cork Grease,"The grease itself is very good; my only ""complaint"" would be the form - I prefer my cork grease in a chapstick tube form, likeBuffet Crampon Cork Grease (Tube)"
2,"Title should be ""the expensive not so big house""","I made a list of my favorite ideas from this book, and I took that list to our builder. What I learned is that the author has told us how to build a wonderful small house -- but the kinds of details and materials she advocates will produce a small house that costs as much as a large one! I still agree in principle with the idea of building great smaller homes, but this book is only for those who have lots of money to spend."
2,"Stylish, expensive and uncomfortable","This book seemed to me to mainly be an essay on how to hire an architect to create a trendy, uncomfortable home. Some of the layout ideas do appear to have value, but it tends to be masked by the very uncomfortable looking designs. One specific comment would be that she writes about consideration for the lifestyle changes that are (nearly) inevitable as one gets older, but then gushes about children's rooms that are clearly designed in a way that will never be usable after the last child is more than about 9 years old.I would recommend American Bungalow Style or something similar before this."
3,Are these homes really small?,I was expecting her projects to downsize to ~1000 square feet. It felt like she was reducing large McMansions to smaller McMansions. Good photographs though!
2,"this book is about HUGE, non-urban custom houses in the rural midWest -book is irrelevant to small urban homeowners","I am puzzled by the title and the contents.I wanted a book about small houses and how to remodel or decorate them. This book cannot be more irrelevant.This book is exclusively about custom built, large (2000 sqft+) houses for people (retired wealthy, or professional double income wealthy) with unlimited budgets who are building their dream home in the country woods.What really bugged me is that ""not so big"" in this book really means ""not a 5 bedroom MacMansion."" If you are in New York City, Los Angeles, or San Francisco, the featured houses would count as rare gargantuan behemoths.I thought book editors gave lots of thought to titles, but this title was downright misleading."
2,The interiors all look the same!,"Susanka has a great concept: less is more. But the problem is that her ""less"" is gunked up by more, more, more! I've never seen so many interiors so similar to each other, all featuring tons of that Minnesota wood. Susanka raps modernism for its impersonality of style, but her ""detail"" in house after house is just as alienating. Try Terence Conran's ""The Essential House Book,"" and fill up one of his minimal homes with your own style, not Susanka's or HGTV's! And beyond that, her environmental message is compromised. Excess is excess no matter how you cut it, whether it comes from gross size or gross detail. Maybe the answer is simply simplicity....at all levels of construction and design."
5,Quality over Quantity,"Sarah Susanka's book put into words how my husband and I felt when we were looking to purchase a home. The homes available left us uninspired and cold. ""The Not So Big House"" emphasizes quality over quantity."
4,"It's good to rethink our ""bigger is better"" orientation.","I'm all for advocating the beauty and practicality of smaller spaces. We no longer need to be ashamed that we can't afford a huge house, but proud of our ability to get along with less and infuse it with efficiency. Who wants to spend all that time maintaining a mansion?? Not me. Congrats to Sarah for putting forth the logic and appeal of the appropriate rather than the excessive. In the same vein, read ""A Home for the Soul"" by Anthony Lawlor, another inspiring voice."
2,"Not for owner of the ""Not so Big House""","The title of this book is misleading. If you truly have a ""not so big house"" this book does not offer any usefull suggestions for creating useful space in a small home. Compared to our little 1918 bungalow, the houses in this book seemed spacious. While the book offers many beautiful photos of space saving ideas- they are all applied to houses that don't really qualify as ""not so big"". I didn't find any of the concepts applied to our ""not so big"" home. Very disappointing."
2,Too big to be small.,"Compared to a 5000 sq ft home, 2500 sq ft isn't big. But is 2500 sq ft really a ""not so big house""? I don't think so. A well thought out floor plan of 1500 sq ft or less (preferably less) can provide for everything a family needs and help people stay connected to each other.While the book did spark some ideas around the use of space and built-ins, overall I was very disappointed with the less costs more therory as presented in this book. It promotes a spending level that is beyond the average american's grasp."
2,"Outdated 70's Look, but a Good Concept","I was disappointed once I got past the first couple of chapters. It was simply the same information repeated. No specifics really - and very few floor plans to show how the concepts are applied. The example of the couple who were disappointed with their 4000+ sq. ft., 500k suburban tract home rebuilt with the author for the same price, a 2300 square foot home. This isn't the goal of most people. The author doesn't really offer many tips other than cutting out the dining room and having the step-down ""great rooms"" that were popular during the 70's, along with using a bedroom/study that has a door as the away room. Almost all the rooms shown have dark wood trim and ceiling beams in all rooms with white walls. It would have been a better book if it showed the work of many architects instead of one."
2,Blah,"I echo the below review noting that this book seems to be an unsubtle marketing exercise. Almost every example seems to be one cooked up by the author's firm in the Minnesota woods or suburbs.Also, a few of the model homes (e.g., p148) I found to be really ugly. The same example homes show up over and over. The text and design are more suitable for coffee-table book than a serious discussion. The advance review on the back cover is from the author of ""Care of the Soul."" Please.There are two or three insightful ideas here, but they deserve a more thorough, practical and analytical treatment."
3,nice picture book,It's not worth the full cover price. This is a good book to look at but you won't be referring to it time and again so it may not be worth owning though worth a look.
2,"Design is visual, but these photos don't make the grade","I picked up this book at the store but didn't buy it because it has a dated, depressing ""feel"" about it. I read the comments from the reader who didn't feel the dated photos were importand and I must disagree. I'm looking for a good home-building-ideas book that mixes good tips and home philosophy with photos of apealing rooms. By appealing, I mean rooms that offer a seamless blend of appealing architecture AND interior design ideas. Good design must have both. This book only does half the job -- it seemed to have a nice philosophical slant, but, unfortunately, the tired interior design shown in many of the room pix made me put the book back down."
3,"Nice, but most of the ""not so big"" still seems huge.","The illustrations are beautiful, and the idea is interesting, but when she called a 2300 square foot house not very big, I had to laugh -- I'm trying to figure out how I can make my 1200 square foot house work better for this family of three (and more planned). I see her basic points, but even her ""not-so-big"" houses are in the fantasy realm for someone of our income."
5,A Book of Content with Pictures ... Not a Picture Book,"Most books of this ilk seem to be filled with photos and captions to help explain what you're seeing. This isn't.This book has _content_ and uses the photos to help illustrate the points that Sara Susanka makes in the text.I picked up this book out of curiousity since we've always liked the homes we've seen that have been designed by the firm Mulfinger, Susanka, Mahady & Partners. I _read_ this book because I found that there was actually a body of thought that supported the book. And, I bought the book because I think it's a classic chance to better understand why their homes are so appealing.For now we live in a suburban home that has little character but (I think and hope)can be transformed to a more comforting place thanks to Susanka's book.And, when we make enough money, who knows -- maybe we'll be able to commission Mulfinger, Susanka, Mahady & Partners to build our Not-So-Big-House.Thanks for a great book!"
5,Would you rather build a house or a home?,"Despite additions such as ""feature walls"" in purple and the like, many show homes still feel more like mausoleums. If you would like to build a house that has character and yet retains all the comforts of home, then this book is for you. This book is about the way in which we live in spaces and how to make those spaces work for us.This is the first house book I have seen for a long time where even just flicking through the pictures I was saying ""yes, yes, yes! That's what I want!"". Even though many of the photos are of the same houses, because the flow of the houses is different, it is fascinating to look at all of the different viewpoints.This book makes an excellent companion to Use what You Have Decorating and the Healthy House books. A great springboard for ideas and a must read if you wish to create a house that you love to live in."
4,great ideas,"I liked this book as it confirmed that bigger isn't better. Another great book on making a smaller house look larger is ""The House that Faux Built: Transform Your Home with Paint, Plasters and CreatityThe House That Faux Built"
4,The way we really live - not just for homeowners.,"Read this book during my house search last month. It completely changed my views about the kinds of home that I am looking for. I am glad that I picked up this book. I too was a big fan of high ceilings and huge living room. After reading this book, I started to ask myself why I would need so much space - and how I would ever be able to fill it up (with huge furniture, of course). There is space in my current apartment now that I barely spend time in. (And I have never figured out what to do with the fireplace when the temperature never goes below 50F.) Her suggestion about designing homes/living space around one's life-style is an absolute an eye opener. I have since turned my living room into a reading room. I cleaned out my patio and spend more time out there. I will keep looking but the apartment seems to suit my life-style for now."
3,"Disappointing, considering the premise.","Although Susanka wrote the entire book on the premise of advocating smaller houses with exquisite features, these houses are huge and boring. The ideas in this book are for new, large, empty spaces. If you can afford to have these houses built, you can afford a real architect to give you design ideas. These aren't revolutionary ideas, they just look like any other house you'd see in a new subdivision, only with bigger windows and a lot more millwork tacked on. I would instead recommend any of the books by Terence Conran or Taunton's other books for kitchen and bath designs. Since Conran is based in Europe, all of his photos are of much smaller and older houses, with design details I have never seen in America. The Taunton's books have details that are more original and can be used in any size house."
3,"great idea, but repeated over & over & over","This was such a refreshing ""concept"" in home design. I had been looking and looking at new homes and just kept saying ""this doesn't feel comfortable"". I would look at a house and say these few rooms are all we really need but the builders kept adding so much extra wasted space for rooms that no one would ever use. This book zeros in on those concepts perfectly, but maybe a short story instead of an entire book would have been more appropriate. I kept saying OK, OK I've got the idea, now give me something else, but no other ideas came out. Even so, I enjoyed the book very much because the concept is so unique. A lot of the pictures were quite dated. I would recommend the book if you have not yet considered: you don't have to have the biggest house on the block to have the best house on the block!"
2,The Not So Inspiring House,"I ordered this book after reading great reviews since I was in the middle of trying to work out the purchase of a turn of the century home where space was the size of just that, turn of the century. The Amazon review picked all the best photo's in the book and the only pages worth reading in it, so I bought it. I was extremely disappointed to receive a book that had too many 1980 - 1990's dated, uninspiring interiors and not so much in the way of smart architectural choices to think about, as was advertised."
3,Chicken Soup for the Homeowner's Soul,"Shows the latest trends in home design. Nothing you're likely to be able to afford, of course, but the pleasant commentary and artfully composed photographs will carry you away to a wonderful world of make-believe.You'll learn why wealthy folks prefer large but impersonal homes, why an open floor plan makes rooms *seem* larger, no doubt helped by the fact that they actually *are* larger. See why the styles shown in these pages will never be as outdated and amusing as a boomerang coffee table. Plus, why it's OK to build a 4000 sq ft one-bedroom home--as long as that's what ""suits your lifestyle"".Just kidding of course. Follows the long tradition of style books aimed at homemakers, as opposed to builder's guides aimed at carpenters."
3,"Not So Big, but Not So Inexpensive Either","You'd think a ""not so big"" house would be not so expensive, but this book isn't about building small, budget-conscious homes. It's really directed at the group of wealthy people who usually build 3,000+ square foot homes. The author shows these people how they can build a home with more character and better materials by forgoing rooms like the much-unused dining rooms of yesteryear, large foyers and hallways and creating floor plans where rooms open to each other and their characters are determined by the placement of furniture. It's good advice for anyone building a home, no matter what his or her budget may be. Just don't be fooled by the photos if what you really can afford is something under $250,000. You aren't likely to be able to build one of these homes for that. (...)"
3,Good but Not Great,"Although both ""The Not So Big House"" and ""Creating the Not So Big House"" are good books with well-thought out concepts, I think you can find better books on the subject. After reading both books, I felt the information rather evaporated, and I was left without some good, basic practical outlines on how to proceed with the house. Fortunately, I came across ""The Home Design Handbook"" by June Cotner Myrvang & Steve Myrvang, AIA, where at the end of every well thought out chapter, you found a detailed, practical checklist of major issues that needed to be considered before proceeding with your plans. Everything missing in the ""Not So big House""(s) was found in this one book, which offered highly useful information."
2,No variety,"I think I'd like this book better if it showed more variety. Many of the interiors have a dated quality. And they tend to all be neutral with lots of wood and an overriding Craftsman look. The point of the book is great, but I'd love a book that shows me small houses in a wider range of styles. How about something slick and modern? Or how about showing a traditional Cape? Or a 1958 ranch house?"
4,BIG IS NOT BETTER,"The concept behind this book matches my thoughts exactly. I do agree with the reviewers comments that the interiors look dated, (most architects are not interior designers) but those reviewers are being to literal. The interior (and exterior) can be in any style that appeals to your taste. What is important is applying the elements and principals of design, not just blindly following the latest trend. Just because it might cost the same; big is not better. Most people wrongly assume that working with an architect and interior designer is only for the wealthy, but these trained and experienced professionals can guide you to the best possible result, whatever your financial resources."
1,Would have helped to have known .......,"Just having bought an 1887 house in a small southern town, this book was not what I needed. It was well written, beautiful photography and layout, but not within the price range or geographical range. It might have saved me some money if these items of interest to readers had been mentioned. Also - ""mission"" or ""prairie"" is not a dominant theme in this area."
5,Required reading and the best book . . .,"for General Remodeling and New Home Building. This prerequisite will save you time and money before and after the design phase. Ms. Susanka's mind provoking approach to home design tackles some of the toughest aspects: storage, lighting and home character. These challenges are adapted for DINKs, SINKs, Empty Nesters and Kids. Our home is not going to be 'NOT SO BIG' and we have found ways to integrate her discussions on: ceiling heights, soffits, storage, hearths and alcoves. Attempting to make our home intimately and interetingly grand."
1,Purely written to market her firm.,"After reading the book I was disappointed. It seemed like another gimic book trying to ""sell"" another new trend. What was so shocking is that the homes were all upper market, very expensive. What we need are designs that build smaller and less expensive homes...that are still fun to live in."
2,Atomic Rooster - 'Anthology' (Castle),"Reason I've EVEN giving this 2-CD / 25 (not 30) track anthology a two-star rating is for the low asking price. Problem is this posting's track listing is wrong, so EITHER another label released a compilation 2-CD with the SAME exact cover and / or title OR this posting's listing of the songs is a mistake. Either way, this one is strictly for the completists."
1,same old songs compiled yet again,these songs make up most of the compiliations out there and do not show the better side of this band. try the haavy soul compilation instead for a good intro to atomic rooster at its best.
3,Not my Devil's Answer,"American buyers beware: The version of The Devil's Answer on this compilation is the UK single version. In between the release of the UK single and the release of the US version the original vocalist left the band and so the vocal was redone (by the replacement singer, an octave higher and in a somewhat different style), and the two versions sound very different as a result. Given that there was room on this 2-CD anthology for both versions (without having to cut any other track), it's a real shame (from an American buyer's standpoint) that the US version wasn't included."
2,Not good.,"I am about 3/4 of the way through this book and had to look up reviews, I felt like I was missing something, I just couldn't follow the flow of the book. Once I read the reviews, I realized it was not me, the book is not good. Great, yes, we ALL know you attend Princeton, super for you, but to go on and on boring, pompous, the story is all over the place and so far has come to no real conclusion or charactor development. Save yourself the time, skip this book."
3,Review,"The book is set on the Princeton campus during the weekend of Good Friday, 1999. The story involves four Princeton seniors, friends and roommates, getting ready for graduation: Tom, Paul, Charlie and Gil. Two of the students, Tom and Paul, are trying to solve the mystery contained within an extremely rare, beautifully decorated and very mysterious (real) book-- the Hypnerotomachia Poliphili""---Julia Sneden"
3,Do not expect the DaVinci Code,"The publishers have appeared to run on the coat tails of Dan Brown's book, but these have only the similarity of hidden codes in an ancient text.There is a lot more interaction and building up of relationships between the protaganists in this story, but much of the dialog in the first half comes off as contrived. Without a strong plot to pull it forward, I was tempted to just stop reading.I pressed on because I hate to return a book to the library unfinnished. Once things get a little more intense at the halfway point, then the action in the second half of the book carries the story along.Lots of flashbacks which means that as you wait in agony for the plot to move forward, it keeps slipping backwards.I think that if you judge this book on its own, it is interesting enough for a first attempt. Like with Brown's book you will ask yourself afterwards how much was real and how much was fiction. The difference is you will care just a little bit less about the answer."
2,What a waste of money,"I am so sorry I purchased this book. The authors have disguised a history lesson into a mystery. Actually, there was no mystery. The characters were unlikable and highly unbelievable. The long drawn out plot, full of fluff, was too much. I am surprised I made it through the entire book. I stayed up late reading, hoping that some big secret would be revealed in the end. I was wary of the DaVinci code because of all the hype so I chose this book instead. Now I am reluctant to read Davinci! If you are absolutely fascinated by the Italian Renaissance, this book is for you. However, if you only have a passing interest, get ready to be bombarded by historical facts and characters who are too smart for the average reader. Save your money. Get this one from the library."
2,The Rule of Knock-Offs,"Like many people, I was sucked into the idea that this was going to be ""The Next 'Da Vinci Code'."" Instead what I was treated to was a relatively dull ""mystery"" about four college kids living seemingly dull lives. The campus descriptions were uninteresting, especially all of the nonsense about social clubs and how you get in to the clubs to EAT. Whoopee. The ""twists"" of the book were elementary at best, and the spoon-feeding of the ""mysteries"" and ""riddles"" of the book down right amateurish. And the ending was as predictable and lame as a hackneyed made for TV movie. None of the characters were all that interesting. The love interest was loveless, sexless and relationshipless. They could have been robots for all I know. Not a well crafted book, at least not one that deserved to have its name uttered in the same sentence as Dan Brown's brilliant 'Da Vinci Code'. Save your money. Get it at the bargain bin, or from the public library."
2,An Adequately Written Novel,The dusty scent of ancient books sets an alluring background for this University based drama but don't let the promise of wisdom fool you. No matter how smart the intention The Rule Of Four comes up weak on character. An oversimplified series of events that barely leaves the grounds of Princeton eeks the reader forward without a semblence of emotional impact. I was tempted several times to abandon this text but it was the only book I had with me on vacation so I reluctantly finished it. Should The Rule Of Four have a grain of truth (Which it appears to) then perhaps the fun of weaving those mysteries into fiction was the main idea. Either way the writers missed the mark and clearly didn't deserve such overwhelming exposure for only an adquately written novel.
1,This is no DaVinci Code,"I read this book because it was on a recommendation list for people who liked The DaVinci Code. I do not recommend it. While the DaVinci Code was a fast-paced suspense with a bit of romance thrown in, Rule of Four is a painfully slow book about the unrealistically stupid choices of college kids with a bit of riddling thrown in. The reader is hardly even a part of the puzzle solving, usually just being informed after the fact that a riddle has been solved.While the idea for the book is fantastic, it was poorly executed. If you're looking for impressive literary knowledge wasted on an embarrasingly high schoolish coming of age book, you'll like Rule of Four."
1,Save Your Money,"If you are interested in the angst of college students, by all means read this book. While the DiVinci Code was entertaining, this book is merely boring. I finished it because I try to finish all books but it was slow going. I generally can read a book this length in 4 hours but this one was read in increments of 15 minutes over a week."
1,Rule of Bore,I looked forward to reading this book...gave it 100 pages before schlepping it back to the library unfinished. I'm no writer but I could have done a better job with dialogue and character development. Good story-line given to a lousy writer. (peering over bifocals) Next!
2,Bogged Down in Flashbacks,"The synopsis of this book sounded great. Too bad the actual story kept getting bogged down in history, backstory, and flashbacks. I swear I got dizzy from zipping through time. Perhaps the authors should consider taking weaving lessons...The prose is often nice, even poetic at times, but that couldn't compensate for the noticable lack of tension. The conflict and characterization just doesn't seem sufficient to carry the story.I have no idea how it ends and may not find out. Even as a history lover, I don't think I can take another long and boring detour through the ages.No comparison to The Da Vinci Code, which kept me comfortably hooked."
2,"If you have NOTHING else to do, you can kill time with this book.","As a rave reader of mystery books, I was expecting a lot from this one. The summary and the reviews of this book were really appealing, and I really expected something at the DaVinci Code's level. NOTHING to do with it. Although it also deals with secret codes, the book is written very poorly. You always have the feeling of reading a book written by and for high school or university students, (like those who write to participate in contests) but you never feel like you have real literature in your hands. Even in the most important parts of the book, the authors never take you to the real climax of the story. I give it two stars because I think the plot is good, yet a lot more could have been done to make this book really worth to buy it and not get really dissapointed about it!"
1,"Don't buy, don't read it","What cracks me up most about the reviews are those that say this book is an intellectual thriller. I am not sure what they mean, I guess they are trying to say that if you did not enjoy this book then it is not because the book is bad, but because you aren't smart enough to enjoy it. The book is so bad that I could barely finish it. Much of the book adds nothing to the story, nothing to character development. The characters are stereotypes. The characters are shallow, undeveloped and boring. It is obvious that the authors think more of themselves than anyone else ever would. Throughout the novel, the authors keep alluding to the characters' intelligence but rarely if ever display it."
1,Read Harry Potter again,"This is absolutely, unequivocally, the worst book I have ever read. Disjointed chronologically, boring cardboard characters, one woman -- but plenty of other stereotypical folks. Where's their motivation? Why are they sucked into this obsure renaissance text? Comparisons to Da Vinci Code (a popcorn screenplay masquerading as a novel, but quite a lot of fun) are ridiculous.Seems to be Written by Four -- I can't figure out where I am and what has happened, and could really care less. Frat boys romping around Princeton -- do they study or have any other academic responsibilities? Do they take creative writing classes?If you get the urge to read this book -- re-read Harry Potter novels instead. Or rent Indiana Jones. (Though now I know a bit more about the dreaded Basilisk, thanks to Ian and Dustin.)"
1,"Brings new meaning to the word ""boring""","The Rule of Four should be retitled The Rule of Bore. I kept hoping it would become somewhat compelling and fun, but, despite a good first 50 pages, it never did. It resembles The Da Vinci Code like John Kerry resembles George Bush. In other words, it doesn't. Don't waste your time or money. If your curiosity is still piqued, then simply check it out from the library."
1,as bad as it can get,"Others that gave 1 star (and I agree, I would love to give a negative rating) have said it all, but to strentghen their efforts in warning others, here's my contribution: this book contains a childish idea, average high-school level of writing, and a few pages copied from history books.It is certainly one of the worst books I have ever read. And the only reason I'll try to remember the names of the authors of The Rule of Four is to avoid their next book."
2,Here's all of the boredom missing in Da Vinci Code!!,"I bought this in an airport to read on the plane, like many others I was attracted by the comparison to Da Vinci Code and the reference to being a New York Times best seller. I have learned my lesson and in the future will buy my books well before I get on the plane.The plot centers around two Princeton students discovering the secrets held in a book from the Renaissance. Thrown in were a stock love interest, painfully detailed descriptions of Princeton geography and rituals, and various forgettable minor characters. Reading this book is like sitting in a Princeton grad's living room watching an interminable slide show, with most of the slides out of order.I am giving the book 2 stars because some of the Renaissance material was interesting and I would have liked to read more about it. Most of the book unfortunately was spent slogging through self-absorbed college students and the campus they apparently love."
1,Fell asleep,"I believe that this book was ""hyped"" to be another runaway hit like the Da Vinci Code. But it was all that...just hype.I was disappointed to read a very disorganized, slow-moving, zero climax story. There is too much useless dialogue that has nothing to do with the plot. There are almost no twists. The riddles were corny.With the Da Vinci Code, you couldn't put down the book and you look forward to the next chapter.With this book, you always put down the book and you even want to skip chapters and see what the whole point is about.If you want to get bored...read this.Clive Cussler would have done a better ""codex/thriller"" book."
2,Marginal at best,"What a hum drum book. How anyone could compare this to the Da Vinci Code is beyond me. The authors spent more time on the boring characters than on the meat of the story. I was halfway through it before I even became mildly interested. Not worth the buy. Sorry guys, better luck next time."
2,Not worth reading,"I had a hard time finishing this book. The premise was weak: trying to be a DaVinci code type book. The transition to different times: Renaissance, two months ago, present were rough and messed with the flow of the book. The writing is weak. And, the book didn't manage to pull you in, despite suspenseful moments, because the author would pause to describe uninteresting details in the midst of what should have a been a frantic chase scene. I don't like to give up before the last page, so I hung in there, but it was like wading through very muddy water."
2,"Interesting idea, much promise - doesn't deliver","I about 2/3 of the way through it and never finished. I just didn't care enough about the characters or the riddle they were trying to solve. The story starts out interesting enough. The back stories on the characters and how they got to Princeton was great too. It was too long, too much repetition and just not interesting enough to finsih."
1,HORRIBLE,"I can't believe I read the whole thing. I kept hoping it would get better, that something would happen...nothing did. First of all, college kids don't act this way; as if they were 45 or 50 years old. Let's just say, there was way too much latent stuff going on between the friends and rivals and mentors...It just seems as if the authors promoted a lot of touching and male nakedness going on. Weird. If you got rid of all the useless drivel about Princeton, the book would be 10 pages long. It appears as if the authors wanted a memoir of their time at Princeton, not to actually write a story; let alone make it somewhat interesting. The characters were uninteresting and boring. The plot was way too unbelievable. The characters were able to walk around crime scenes and escape from police as if they were invisible. The authors were far out of their league. I wish I could have the time back that I spent reading this wreck."
3,Decent plot - questionable ending,"The Rule of Four was not all that I thought it would be...I enjoyed the basic plot and could see the Dan Brown type writing within but it lacked the staying power that Brown has. Without too much trouble you can see the ending of this novel from page 10. I was hoping that there would be more of a twist to the ending than there was.The book was easy to read with clear language and dialogue. An average reader could get through this book very quickly.Overall I would say you get what you see from this book. There are no ""big surprises"" that will keep you guessing."
1,sophomoric,"The hype of The DaVinci Code has opened up a field for wannabes, and this book leads the pack. . Don't be misled by the stacks of this book in stores nationwide right next to the stacks of the DaVinci Code ~ ""Rule"" is not nearly as good as the ""Code""!The four key characters have a close and plausible, if boring, relationship ~ comfortable at Princeton, for four years, which is the setting of the entire book, with flashbacks to important childhood experiences. They may go off-campus, which is a dangerous place, some people do get killed, but they never even leave town. Sure, references to people who live in New York (gasp !), and several have gone to Europe. But Princeton is boring, and these people are too.For two guys who graduated with distinction from Harvard and Princeton, they certainly could use some guidance in character development, and should be smart enough to know when to get the help of a top notch editor."
1,HORRIBLE!!!,"I usually don't bother to write reviews, but this book is so bad that I want to warn others not to buy it. This may not be the worse book I've ever read, but it does rank among the top (or bottom) 5 of the worse books I've ever read. The characters are unbelievable, the story is unbelievably boring and slow. These are characters that I could care less about. Don't bother wasting your time or money on this book, unless you need a really good night's sleep. Don't believe the reviewers!"
1,"Scott Fitzgerald,Umberto Eco and Dan Brown Could Sue","Only the unbelievable(which we all swallowed) words on the back of the book claiming the titled authors as a group would be the only ones,together,that could write such a book-""stunning,extraordinary,brilliant,a must-read""got me to buy this book.Indeed it is the ONLY way this book could have gotten on the bestseller lists.This is surely deliberate ,false advertising. There should be some way to get those words retracted.It is not just me.Read the other reviews."
1,"Extremely boring, don't bother","I was really looking forward to reading this book. However, I feel it was just a description of college life at Princeton--over and over. There was no suspense, not likeable characters, and was EXTREMELY boring and hard to hold one's interest. They had a good subject to make a fantastic book and they did very little with it. It was a disappointment for me. After reading all of Cussler's, Brown's, Preston's, and Rollin's books, these authors will never be anything like them. They know how to tell a story."
4,"Not as good as Dan Brown, But good in its own right","If you are looking for something to hold you over until the next Dan Brown book comes out this will work, its good and suspenseful. I just don't feel like I am getting to know the characters as well as I do in Dan Brown's books. See it is written in the voice of one college boy narrating the story, and I feel like I want to know what the others are thinking. It is still a good read though!"
1,Harder to read than the Hypnertoma...whatever.,"Fortunately two guys wrote this, so they can blame each other for how bad it is."
1,Disjointed DaVinci Code imitation,"This book has so many diversions that it's hard to maintain interest in the main story theme. The only way I was able to not lose interest entirely was to speed read and ignore unnecessary background prose. In a few words after reading this book, my admiration for Dan Brown's story telling grew immensely."
2,do not expect much,"The start was fine and promising. But I got bored waiting the excitement to start and when finally I was at the end, I discovered that it will never start in this book. Very bad and typical ending. While the authors force themselves to leave an open box at the end (probably for the second book option) they srew the readers' expectations."
3,Complicated mystery with simple characters,"I really loved the mystery of the HP, and all the history that was included in the storytelling. In this respect it was MUCH better than Davinci Code. The puzzles were much more complicated and based in reality. The final secret, while not as controversial as the DC, was still very satisfying. That said, everything else about the novel was shallow and at times, very boring. The characters and their relationships to each other had no depth, and at times seemed VERY contrived. Sometimes the side plots seemed to be forced on the reader, like the authors thought , ""well...we need to have a love story"", or ""we need to have someone almost die to prove how dramatic this all is""...a bit formulaic. When the authors were focused on the main mystery and history of the HP, the book was very compelling, but the characters were highly forgettable."
1,Rule of Four,"Very disappointing after reading the reviews. A difficult read, hard to follow. Not even close to being as good as the DaVinci Code. Skip this one!!"
1,A waste of time,"Silly, childish, no point except for the authors' attempt to show that someday they probably will write a book worth reading."
2,Life at Princeton,This is a boring book about 4 students living their senior year at Princeton. Not nearly as exciting as the De Vinci code or Angles and Demons. The authors didn't give the same turn paging urgency. It was easy to put down.
5,Fabulous,"Great book. Really enjoyed reading it. It had some very well constructed passages with interesting insight, all this of course was wrapped up in an exciting thriller. I must compliment the fact that the authors did not go overboard with too many twists and turns that ruin so many of the best sellers today. It kept you guessing but was not too off the wall. Just right. I anxiously await the next effort of these two young scribes."
4,"Not like DaVinci Code, but a solid effort","If you were looking for a DaVinci Code-like book (page turner, suspense, action with some intellectual backdrop), don't go here.This is much more of an intellectuals book, yet written by two recent college alums who still somewhat pine for those days it seems. The excitement of romances, politics of eating clubs at Ivy league schools, etc. all are wrapped around the history of an obscure renaissance book which only a few academia feel is worth researching anymore.Some of this generates excitement, but the pleasure in this read is the awkwardness of its writers in determining whether to be an intellectual suspense thriller or document the nuances of college life via the nude olympics or steam tunnel paintball.In the end, your 'relative' age, appetite to adapt your perspective to new writers and interest in Ivy League life might be what decides the value of this for you."
1,The Rule of Four,"The only way the authors could have spent five years writing this book is if they first went on vacation for 4.5 of those years. Booring, terrible, poor character development, obscure clues, very predictable ""Hollywood"" ending, waste of good trees for the paper."
2,Not good enough,This book is remarkable. Remarkable that it actually was a book seller. My guess is that the book was carried to sucess by the wave the Da Vinci Code created. Otherwise it is not worthy to see the light of day.This is a book about smart people being smarter than the general populace. This is a book that goes nowhere. It strives to be literary enough to be remembered but fails and it strives to be entertaining enough. It fails there too.
3,"Good book, but...","This is a very good story, but some part are a little too long.It is sometime hard to keep the story line with all the flashback."
3,Where are the thrills?,"For a thriller, there weren't too many thrills. I did not find myself tearing through this one. The plot lines were a little too dense and the writing was just ok. WAIT FOR THE PAPERBACK - I wish I had."
1,BORING!,"I too was looking forward to reading the next ""Da Vinci Code"". I was disappointed to find a book with unsympathetic characters, a far-fetched plot, and way too much back story. The secret of the book is neither shocking nor thought-provoking.If you want another ""Da Vinci Code"", try Lewis Purdue's ""Daughter of God."" Borrow this from your library."
2,YOU CALL THAT AN ENDING,"THE RULE OF FOUR is an easy enough read. As has been stated it is not as gripping as THE DA VINCI CODE or ANGELS AND DEMONS, but these guys are novices. Regardless, I have to ask if they were limited in the number of pages they could produce? The ending is TERRIBLE!!! Why spend all of those pages on character development, only to wrap the ending up so poorly. It was like you they were running out of paper. Next time write until you finish the story..."
1,THIS is a best-seller ???,"Although the publisher prints several flattering reviews on the book's cover (including several comparisons to DaVinci Code and other such popular ""code"" or ""puzzle"" stories), it's hard to imagine how someone could make such comparisons. A puzzle needs at least two characterists to be interesting: solving it must be worthwhile (e.g., it unlocks a mystery or offers some reward) and the process of solving it must be stimulating. The code chased by the characters in this book [buried within an obscure and impersonal book in history] has neither of these features."
4,A Very Enjoyable Read,"I just finished reading this book and immediately turned to Amazon to find out what other reviewers were saying. I was surprised by all the negative comparisons to the The Da Vinci Code. I thought The Rule of Four was a more intelligent read and was not intended to be the same fast-paced, roller coaster ride as Dan Brown's book. This book was smart, gripping, and a great coming of age story. I agree that the ending was too packaged, but am looking forward to more great fiction from these authors."
1,Horrible,"Absolutely Horrible. I love code books (De Vinci etc.), but this is the worst book I have ever read! I can't believe any Editor would let this be released. Two authors was the tip off. Art by committee has never worked (except maybe Architecture). Stay away.Buy a book on the ""Hypnerotomachia"" and avoid this college crap at all costs. The state of publishing is truely a mess."
2,good but you must have patience,"Do not be confused by the Dan Brown comparison on the front cover. This book is really slow. Though it may be a good book, I can't seem to stay awake long enough to enjoy it."
1,Light on suspense,"Okay, I haven't actually gotten through this entire book, But it is pretty lame so far. I think they were going more for a ""Ninth Gate"" experience, rather than the DaVinci Code. Before I bought this book, I should have realized that it was going to be bad when reviewers compared it to ""A Separate Peace."" I am also pretty tired of reading about College students running around underground tunnels (i.e. the sewers) playing games of tag, dodging piles of ""scat."" I, for one, am not interested in exploring places where I run the potential risk of stepping into piles of ""scat"" in an effort to have a good time and ""blow off steam."""
2,Hmmm,"While the premise of this novel is quite intriguing I would be hard pressed to recommend this book to many. The authors have somehow found it necessary to add overly complex descriptions of times, places or relationships that are not integral to the story. The reader sometimes gets the feeling that they are trying to impress you with their Ivy League education and/or vocabulary. It at times makes for a situation where you are just trying to get through paragraphs to get back to the story. There is also an issue with time...present and past. They mix real time events with story development that occurs in the past...making it difficult to determine the real time line of the book. I think the authors have real potential as storytellers...find a more concise voice"
1,Not even a good exercise book,"I picked up the paperback in a pile of books to read at the gym. (This means that I am very forgiving and not looking for fine literature for this purpose). I have read twenty pages and have to stop. The sophomoric writing and smug tone are just too much. Did these men even take a writing class at Princeton or Harvard? The sentence structure alone is worse than would be found in a high school creative writing class. I think it is insulting to compare this book to ""A Separate Peace"", a well written and moving book. I agree with the skeptical reviewer who suggested family in the publishing business. If they write another book (shudder), the authors might want to consider being less flat-footed about literary and historical references. I would recommend ""The Dream of Scipio"" by Iaian Pears as a well-written book in a similar vein."
2,Writing is not a group activity.,"This best-seller suffers greatly from the lack of a cohesive and consistent style. It pretends to be intelligent, but it is only college-boy clever (albeit very bright college boys). It fails to live up to its billing as a puzzler, as no clues are available to the reader to figure out the puzzles. The romance is sophomoric and the plot is filled with inconsequential detail. I can't imagine why people flock to buy it."
2,plod along from Princeton,"""waded"" through this one, had to see how it ended. Basically, over-wrought, plodding, over-intellectualized drivel, which doesnt really get half-going until about the middle of the book; with, unfortunately, an ""is-that-all-there-is payoff."" Gee..I wish I had gone to Princeton and took all those neato humanities and english and literature classes and then I could have wrote this for my mom and all the rest of my neato-smarto friends too.....but I didnt, went to Stanford instead....."
2,Stick with Umberto Ecco and Donna Tartt,This is a good first novel but a far cry from Umberto Ecco and Donna Tartt. There is too much Princeton nostalgia in this book and the writers' immaturity is quite evident in every page.
1,SHOULD BE ONLY 50 PAGES LONG!,NICE IDEA - HORRIBLE WRITING - BORING CLICHE' ENDING.Where was the editorial staff?This book should have been only 50 pages long.
1,359 pages of boredom 11 pages of excitement,"Let's describe ad nauseum our Ivy League school, how vastly educated we are and how we-are-superior-than-you-common-people- because-we-understand-latin-and-complex-mathematical-processes. This is a convoluted,long-winded book that did not convince me that anyone could get THAT excited about this ancient manuscript. Too much throwing around of pseudo-intellect and rah rah Princeton, and aren't we clever with our science project. These characters are self-centered, sorry-for-themselves, users who have elevated themselves far above anyone who might take an interest in their thin story. Too much $$ for too little satisfaction."
2,DISAPPOINTED,"I don't understand the hype or the comparisons with the Da Vinci code ,apart from the obvious .It has none of the fast pace or excitement of the Da Vinci code. Instead it is a struggle to wrestle through the pages. The most frustrating bit is the time line of events ,which is hard to follow and doesn't always make sense.Having grown up in Princeton , I do enjoy the place references and the campus descriptions ."
2,What!?,"Let me start off by saying this is nothing like The Da Vinci Code or any other Dan Brown book. The writting is on the same level, but I personally liked the Da Vinci Code better. I read it until the end because it was interesting, on the other hand The Rule of Four I have to agree with another reviewer that I finished it just to see if anything was going to happen. On the whole I was disapointed by this book, not because I wanted another da Vinci Code, but because I believe that the authors could have done a better job."
4,Pretty darn good,"I read this book in a single sitting after seeing the amazing reviews in People Magazine and the San Fran Chron. I have a natural aversion to ivy league preening, so some of the early sections at Princeton were a little tough to swallow, but what propels this book is a terrific story, some great scenes, artful writing, and a powerful message about friendship, which I especially liked. Without the Princeton stuff, certainly five stars..."
2,"Wait for the movie, it can't be worse.","Found this in a used bookstore cheap so I grabbed it. Poorly written with flat characters, its fast-paced ""mystery/thriller"" plot takes everything I hate about Dan Brown and amplifies it to absurdity.I was not surprised to find that it was a best seller and a movie in development. It reads like a Hollywood movie I will not see."
2,Poor choice for a gift,"I bought this for a 20-something girl's birthday when it was hot off the presses, thinking that she would like it. Unfortunately, she found it boring and the characters too tedious. I suppose I did not know her tastes. This book clearly does not have universal appeal."
1,More about Princeton University than any real mystery,"Aaagh! Against my better judgement, I stuck with this book through the first 200 pages of tedium. It started to pick up a little then but not nearly enough. The authors seemed to labour the point of knowing the princeton campus and faculty as if it would add some authenticity to the book. It doesn't - the book is marketed as the unravelling of an ancient mystery. Maybe they should rebrand as a tourist guide to princeton campus. A small fraction of the book is devoted to 'the mystery' and the unravelling of the coded messages is painfully drawn out and about as dry as my tongue with a hangover. The characters are annoying and I found myself hoping for a freak hurricane to arrive and sweep the whole lot of them away. I now find myself putting the book away - unfinished with only about 20% of it left - I just cannot muster another ounce of endurance for this book which I had hoped would lead me into interesting and unfamiliar areas."
4,Don't expect action and you won't be disappointed,"This novel is more of a character study than a mystery novel. Unlocking the ancient code is more of a side story to the relationships that are explored between the protagonist and his girlfriend, his roommates, and the legacy of his father in which he lives. The variety of characters provides for shifts in focus throughout the novel, so you don't get bored. Of course, if you're looking for the page-turning suspense of a Dan Brown book, you won't find that here. You will however find a cast of characters entrenched in an ancient mystery which threatens to put them out of touch with reality and takes you through the turmoil of reconciling the present world (senior thesis, loss of loved ones, bonds of friendships) to the riddles of history. If you like Amy Tan's The Joy Luck Club more than any of Daniel Silva books, give The Rule of Four a try."
4,The Rule of Four pulls you in and keeps you there...,"I found The Rule of Four to be an engaging, intellectually stimulating and suspenseful novel. The characters were unique and interesting. I appreciated how it mentioned several historical figures, pieces of literature and well known art. Although you expect certain ""conflicts"" (whether internal or external) to be neatly tied up in the end, the conclusions were more real to life. It is an excellent book for first time authors. I look forward to reading future books by Caldwell and Thomason."
3,a da vinci code for the nerdier set,"While I totally enjoyed the ""lost arcane knowledge"" parts of this book, ""The Rule of Four"" does sometimes get a bit bogged down in its own renderings of college life. This somewhat detracts from what is a very interesting tale of unearthing secrets from a mysterious Renaissance book. Just when i thought the book was going to peter out into a sympathy-fest of lost chances and philosophic musings over days gone by, it delivers one last twist, which makes it all worthwhile!"
1,Terrible Book,This is one of the worst books I have read in many years. The reviews that say it is good must be hype. Don't even think you will enjoy any of the book except for the small part on code breaking. The rest of the novel is childish and poorly written.
1,Please don't encourage bad writing,"Please don't encourage bad writing by buying this book, or even by reading a friend's copy. The plot is paper thin, the timeline is fractured and impossible to follow, the characters are idiots and the writing is one more egregious example of advertising trumping literature. The author attempts to hitch a ride on the shoulders of Dan Brown's Da Vinci Code, but instead he's dragged along hanging onto the threads of Brown's tatterdemalion overcoat. Ugh!"
2,Still trying to get thru this.....,"At page 130 and practicaly NOTHING has happened!! If the DaVinci Code is a Ferrari, than the Rule of Four is a horse & buggy! Do NOT compare the 2! My gosh, 130 pages in and the author(s) are still wasting time on MAIN character descriptions! Seriously, you keep reading about this ancient book that is at the center of this story, but the story is literally going NOWHERE!"
1,You've got to be kidding!,"I tried to read this and get into it but I kept finding myself coming back to one thing. How many college students do you know sit around thinking about, obsessing about and deciphering ancient books? The story was dull and plodding. Had to put it down. It was laughable to me."
2,Good character development?,"I cannot believe that anyone thought this book was some sort of special literary mystery, or that the character development or dialogue was excellent. The only good thing about this book was the actual mystery. The characters were ridiculous, and their musings about life were so stupid that I periodically had to put the book down to roll my eyes for a while. Some of it didn't even actually make sense, and I can see the two authors sitting and trying to decide how and where to add another ""deep thought"". Unfortunately, I'm a sucker for a literary mystery and had to finish the book. The conclusion: basic plot was good, the rest of it was garbage."
2,slow and dry but without the big finish,"Way too slow and punishingly plodding and dry, Princeton is much more colorful than these lads elude. Kept waiting for a big moment, waited the entire tome. And it was. Still hoping there is a big finish to make up for the long dry read. Sorry, cant endorse, I tried but it is simply not there."
4,"Good, but...","I thought this book was an enjoyable read. It's not best-book-ever-written good, but I would recomend it. The story is interesting and unique. At times the book was a bit overwritten (especially some of the metaphor usage). You also get the sense that the book used to be a lot longer and things were taken out to make it a manageable length. Overall, I'd say it's a good, fun book."
2,No Action at all,The book moves at at very slow pace and there is almost no action. The authors spend about 1/2 of the book describing the relationship of the 4 college roomates.....boring. I was very disappointed.
4,Good book but somewhat confusing,"I liked the the way the young authors wrote this novel and I do believe that they have a great potential. Still, the story left me a little confused. I didn't really understand what it was supposed to be about. There are two layers there. It seems to be a serious work that involves such themes as destiny and true calling, talent and meaning of life. But then there is this mistery angle, something like Don Brown, just more intelligent. It has a very interesting premise but the book doesn't really cover this subject, leaving a lot of holes and dedicating the space in the novel to this just between other things. At the same time, this mistery storyline dillutes the more serious layer of the book. The end result is that both layers are left me with the feeling of being not complete. Still, the book is interesting - just be prepared for the slow immersion into the atmosphere the authors created in this novel."
1,Sadly disappointing.,I really hate it when a book doesn't live up to it's hype. How could a book this poorly written make it past the editors? Great story idea but very poor execution. First book? More like first draft. I wish the critics would stop comparing it to DaVinci Code as it doesn't deserve to be on the same bookshelf let alone on the best seller list.And to think I paid 'hardcover' prices.... tsk tsk.
2,Ho Hum....,"It sounds as if the author(s) are Princeton graduates who are writing more to rekindle their memories of the school than to tell a story. The read was thick, sometimes confusing and probably too much about how wonderful it is to be a Princeton elite and not enough on the actual subject."
2,Nothing to get excited over,"This book reads like something written by a couple of bored college students in their dorm, or over a couple of beers in the campus club, with the usual crotch jokes and ""dumb girl"" jokes.Although some of the dialogue between the more erudite professors has the requisite tension to keep the reader amused and informed, there is not enough total cohesion in this book to keep one's attention riveted.In too many places, the narrative rambles, and a little more attention to detail would have been appreciated -- since when can an ""illiterate pickpocket"" (""illiterate"" as defined by Webster's Dictionary: ""having little or no education; especially : unable to read or write"") copy a manuscript (written in either the Roman vernacular or, more likely, written in Latin)??A novel about the steam tunnels would have been more interesting."
1,Oracle,"I am glad that I took the advice of a friend and didn't spend more than an hour or so on this book. My biggest problem was with the poor sentence structure and misplaced punctuation, all of which completely distracted me from the content. Princeton should have made these guys pass English composition before letting them out in the real world."
1,Hype novel of the summer,"Sad to say, but I paid full price... A complete and total hype. You get the feeling these guys sat around over a couple of beers and came up with this great idea: Friends, college pranks, codes, and Animal House and you will have a hit. Too bad I fell for it."
2,Don't waste your money,"I found this book extremely unsatisfying. The characters were irritating. What19- to 22-year-old REALLY cares about unlocking the ""secrets"" of an ancient book? And then we never really get to the bottom of the ""secrets"" at all. I was not happy to have wasted my time pouring through boring descriptions of Princeton's dining system and a girlfriend who only wanted to talk about Camus, only to get to the end, where NOTHING is revealed. Complete waste of time and money. Don't bother. Even if it's in paperback."
3,Good But Not Great,"I bought The Rule of Four expecting it to be what some media called a worthy match to The Da Vinci Code. I had just finished the Code and Raymond John's new novel, The Cellini Masterpiece and liked them both very much. I was disappointed with The Rule of Four. I love history and the background story to the book is fascinating, and to be frank, I think the Renaissance martyr who wrote the Hypnertomachia is far more interesting than the Princeton guys who are supposed to be the main characters. I did enjoy the puzzles and the authors' obvious intelligence, but not enough to strongly recommend this book."
1,Avoid the temptation... don't buy it.,"The novel unwittingly serves as a mirror to the rare Renaissance text (Hypnerotomachia Poliphili), which is the subject of The Rule of Four. One can only hope that, through these jarring transitions, typographical errors, over-wrought metaphors, and clumsy diction, the authors have also hidden a secret, de-codable message that makes this novel worth reading. I for one could not find it and have no interest in trying. I am so disappointed in The Rule of Four, that maybe I will just set it on fire too, though I doubt anyone would martyr themselves rescuing it..."
2,Probably Wouldn't Have Been Published if not for Da Vinci,"This book is better written than the Da Vinci Code, but has a less compelling storyline. It definitely reads like a story written by young, privileged, inexperienced scholars. It isn't tight. It doesn't flow. The depiction of Princeton may be accurate (I don't know), but it is somewhat snobby and offputting (but I've heard that from some people who went there).Not a particularly satisfying read."
1,Eeeccckkk!!! This book is awful!,"Bought it, read it, hated it, and am now selling it to try and recoup my losses...let the buyer beware!"
1,WOW!!! WHAT A BEAR!!!,"THE FIRST HALF WAS BARELY DOABLE.THE SECOND HALF WAS A TAD BETTER---STILL A BEAR THO!!!THE WHOLE TOM & PAUL THING---SORRY---I CANNOT BELIEVE THESE TWO ?? 22 ??YEAR OLDS CAN SOLVE THE RIDDLES----THE WAY THAT THEY DID---WHEN AFTER500 YEARS, NO ONE ELSE COULD SOLVE THEM??????????? I DON'T THINK SO.AND TOM---HOW PATHETIC----HE CAN SOLVE THESE BEEZARR RIDDLES---BUT---HE CAN'T DEAL WITH HIS CURRENT GIRLFRIEND!!! YIKES!!!TOTALLY UNBELIEVABLE"
2,Story was a slow read - not real captivating,There are 2 separate stories here both of which could be great but when combined are lacking. The book revolves around several people who have a common bond through an old book (Hypnoternachia???) that will offer the reader a secret beyond their expectations if they can break the book's code. In the background is a story about Princeton and all the history that institution holds. Going back and forth between the two leaves me wondering how great either story might have been if they separated the 2. I had read the DaVinci code and mistakenly thought this book would be along the same lines - that was an assumption I shouldn't have brought into this book. Because of that I was frustrated that the read wasn't as quick or the history wasn't as detailed. I would urge the authors to go back and write a book about the history of Princeton and their eating clubs. They talked a little about it but it sounds like that could be a book of its own.
1,Yikes! What a waste of time...,"Why is there not a choice for ""no stars""? I would have used that one.This book is poorly written, and is unsuccessfully riding on the coattails of DaVinci Code.What it lacks in a substantive plot, it makes up in the plethora of unimportant characters that share with the reader useless information.This book is truly bad. You don't care about the characters, you don't care about the story, all you wind up caring about is finishing. The book falls flat. The only redeeming quality is the interesting history tidbits that pepper the boring story. And these sprinkles of great history are used more as filler between the AWFUL dialogue than the basis for the book. What a shame.The last three pages were the best ones. So just read those and be done with it.I would definitely NOT recommend wasting time on this. Yours, mine or even your most hated co-workers.. Oh okay, maybe theirs."
1,"Could not finish it, so poorly written","I had such high hopes, and it was painful to be so disappointed that I intentionally left it behind on a trip, because I did not want to carry the book home with me."
2,Very interesting idea but painful execution,"Overall:The ideas behind the book are very interesting using a well known mysterious book with an odd history and turning it into a mystery novel. I love the idea of taking bits from history and putting a new spin on them. However, the interesting elements of the setting/book are quickly drowned out by the tedious characters and the totally unrealistic character actions.I really wanted this to be a good book...I kept hoping but just when it showed promise the joy was sucked out by a stupid character action.Characters:Paper thin and annoying.Plot:Starts off very interesting and quickly slides into ridiculousnessAction:Not well done and very unrealistic even for this type of a fiction novel.Prose:It was simply painful in many parts.Overall: 2 starsCharacters: 0.5 starsPlot: 2 starsAction: 1 starProse: 1 star"
2,"Not close to Dan Brown, but Still OK","For those who want another DaVinci Code, this book is not for you. This book is a lot more dull. Howver, historically, it is very accurate and very thorough in describing the Hypnerotomachia Poliiphili- a Renaissance novel. However, the book is very boring, and it was a pretty much bore to read. I do know understand the Hypnerotomachia more completely and I do think that it is interesting; however,I can't give it more than 2 stars as the authors do a disastorous job in making it suspensful and comparable to the DaVinci Code; it is 372 pages of a slow moving boring book."
1,the hype on this book does not deliver,"Wow---I finally finished this thing---What secrets did we learn??? What was the great mystery??? I DO now know more about Princeton than ever before---so what---the characters are crappy too---maybe I just couldn't read more than 10 pages at a sitting. I read a review that said this book was an ""exciting romp"" Either that guy didn't know what excitment is or I don't know what romping is!!! If you are a normal guy who liked Dan Brown's books, don't let anybody tell you this compares favorably. If they do and you then read it, remember to take it and slap them up side the head with it when you finish...it is a nice size for that!!! I'm on my way now to surprise a friend!!!"
2,A good first draft,"This book should have never been published in this form. Effectively, this is a good first draft of an OK mystery novel. I understand that opinions differ, but I am sorry that I have trusted the positive reviews and wasted the time I could have spent reading Eco."
3,"Not a thriller, that's for sure....","I read this for a book group. If I wouldn't have had to finish it for the meeting, I probably wouldn't have. The characters were too shallow, the plot wasn't really that believeable, and the riddles got to be annoying after a while. I did like the relationship between Tom and Paul and how the authors developed that, but that was about the only saving grace of the book. The plot was pretty predictable and I wasn't too surprised at the ending. There didn't seem to be a feeling of tension or climax at the end, and that was disappointing."
2,It is a shame they market this book with Angels and Demons,"In fact, that is why I took a chance on this book. It starts off interesting enough, but if you are looking for the same unstoppable page turning as Da Vinci Code and Angels and Demons, look elsewhere. Rather than a spine-tingling trip through ancient minds as part of the discovery of an unsolved mystery, this book is simply the chronicle of a student trying to finish a historical term paper. I kept finding myself writing plot twists in my own head, which were far more interesting than the book. And, this book commits the one unforgivable sin (in my humble opinion), the ending is completely unsatisfying. Don't waste your money or time."
1,Overrated,"How the book made it to any bestseller list is the real mystery. The book is lousy. The action stalls, the characters get in the way, and occasionally there is something about a tail of intrigue. It is not seemlessly written between the two authors, grotesquely so. Basically, whoever the author is that writes about the personal interrelationships needs to figure out how to get the characters more involved without the arrogance and immaturity. If you're thinking of reading this one, don't--pick up a real book with a real plot with real suspense and real action."
1,Not with the paper it is written on!!,"This is possible the worst written book I have every read. I am not even sure why I read the whole book. Its kind of like a train wreck, you just can't look away. Do yourself a favor and save your time and money. If you do own a copy send it back to the publisher."
1,completely different than advertised,"I did read the DaVinci Code and thought the book was great and then went on to read two others of his books. The Rule of Four is not this summer's Davinci Code. It has been advertised as another mystery book with all sorts of codes to be deciphered. No, the book is about 4 college friends who do typical college stuff - until the death of one their classmates, halfway through the book. The so-called mystery book is only mentioned briefly as obsessions to various researchers and the readers are only slowly, slowly brought into the mystery book - a book which I found I cared nothing about as it has nothing to do with anyone's lives as opposed to books used in the DaVinci Code. I'm sure this book might be enjoyable to the 20-25 year old crowd who are still close to their college days. I felt suckered by all the advertising promoting this as the next DaVinci Code to be broken - only my wallet was broken."
2,Wine and cheese,"The Renaissance intrigue here is rich and, at times, nearly engulfing. That's the wine of the story. I drank these parts of ""The Rule of Four"" in big, greedy gulps. The flimsy portrayal of college life and friendship in the 90s (I am 32) was trite and hollow. That was the cheese of the book. ""Rule"" left me wondering if the effort was worth it, which is never a trait of a good book."
1,"Great potential, little to show for it.","The Rule of Four shows signs of life here and there, but is ultimately brought down by amateurish writing that no competent editor should have allowed to meet the presses. Besides wooden, trite dialogue, there are parts of this book that just don't add up. So much so, that my first inclination was to cut the authors some slack and wonder if they had written their book in ""code"" like the infamous author of their story. Not wanting to spend time decoding a weak novel, I will offer that this is just bad writing. The major leaps made by the two Princeton students in solving the riddles, the flat, cartoony characters and the tacked on, completely expected ending all add up to a ""why am I reading this"" feeling. While the DaVinci Code (the book Rule of Four is often compared to) is no great work of literature, Dan Brown appears to be a far more competent writer than these two young men. To those contemplating this book...stay away."
2,way over-hyped,"This is an extremely pretentious book. Although well-written in places, it is, on the whole, overwritten. It tries to be both erudite mystery and coming-of-age novel but the ""mystery"" and ""erudition"" take a distant second place to the portrayal of a group of friends going through college with typical relationship problems. Think a ""Friends"" episode with one character saying to another: ""I spent 12 hours today reading the Hypnerotomachia and I made 21 pages of notes. How much time did you spend solving its mystery?"" I'm sorry, if you want some truly erudite mysteries, read The Name of the Rose, and also The Club Dumas. For an excellent book combining mystery, erudition and university life, try Robertson Davies' The Rebel Angels."
2,The Rule of Four,"I agree with the reviewers who thought this book was plodding. If you want an insight into undergrad life at Princeton, read it. If you're looking for strong plot, interesting story and good character development go elsewhere."
1,Fluff,"Disappointing in character development, plotting, and, ultimately, concept, THE RULE OF FOUR was mildly interesting as an ethnography of Princeton undergrad life."
1,The Rule of Ennui,"I love books. I live for books of all kinds. I make it a personal rule (silly, I know) to always read a book in its entirety. The Rule of Four killed me, but I did slog through it to the credit of my tenacity, nothing more. I think, to the best of my memory, it is the only book I ever disliked as much as I do,It is flat, boring, tedious, scattered, obscure, shallow, uninteresting, tortuous...you get my drift.Save yourself some time and pick up any other book but this one. You will have saved yourself time, energy and intellect."
2,Does not live up to the hype...,"I bought this book thinking I was in for a fascinating look at bibliosleuthing and a rich history of hidden literary codes. Instead I could barely make it through without shaking my head in disbelief at the amateur writing, unbelievable plot turns, and all the mundane esoterica involving the four friends. The authors try to manipulate the reader emotionally which leads to an ending that seems forced and, well, stupid. I don't think the top Mensa scholar in the world could solve the riddles involved as quickly as we are forced to believe these guys did. I tried to give this book a chance but it was ultimately disappointing."
3,"Slow paced and artistic, a little boring","The book starts slow, reads slow and ends slow. If you are picking the book expecting a 'Da Vinci Code', you are wrong although it shares some flavours. Book talks more about the lives and passions of people. Not just pure fiction, contains some interesting facts too. Definitely worth the time"
1,Extremely disappointing,"I got this book to read during my vacation to Britain. I thought that I would kill the time on the plane and trains with a good read. I recalled that it was on the New York Times Bestseller list, and the story line seemed like it should be interesting. Unfortunately, I gave up about 3/4 of the way through. The story was boring, and the writing amateurish. The story might have been somewhat interesting had the ""mystery"" been something that could be solved by at least some of the readers. The subject matter, however, was so obscure that hardly anyone would know enough to possibly solve it. Rather than a national best seller, this book seemed like it should have been the type that gets rejected by publishers, and becomes a self-published book. Don't waste your time on it. I'm sorry I did."
1,"Read the reviews, not the book...","This has to be an amazon.com record for one-star ratings for a so-called ""Bestseller"". And deservedly so - other than the rambling positive reviews from the usual crowd of pseudo-intellectuals, listen to the masses and do yourself a favor by spending your time and money elsewhere. If you want to read great thrillers, buy Vince Flynn's ""Memorial Day"", Tom Clancy's ""Rainbow Six"", David Baldacci's ""Absolute Power"" and Kyle Mills ""Sphere of Influence"".Understandably, the general public blindly buys ""Bestsellers"", but after trudging through ""The Rule of Four"", it really makes you wonder just how a book initially makes it onto these lists..."
2,Look at me! I went to Princeton and you didn't!,"Now let me tell you all about Princeton's sewer systems, its student rituals and supper clubs; let me show you how the young well-off intelligentsia pass their time; (they go to Shakespeare plays starring their friends; they play snooker and make awful limericks) but most of all: let me show off my hard-earned education by wrapping this boring self-referential snobbery in a thin story about some medieval mystery which, frankly, isn't all that mysterious anyway, oh, and let me throw in some banal love affair while we're at it, and let's not forget all my cliched friends, such as the young Gatsby, er, Gil, and my sad, pathetic love affair, consummated on top of stacks medieval literature such as 'Utopia' by St Thomas More, how lovely and erotic, on the other hand, why bother?"
1,Shouldn't have been published!,"Imagine if you only have enough material to produce a commercial but tried to stretch it into an epic movie. In publishing, the result will be this book. The authors admittedly altered certain facts but still could not come up with a decent reading. So don't even try to compare this with Da Vinci Code. Ant to think that they already took ONE YEAR to edit this book. I say learn from your mistake guys: either abandon hope being a fictional writer or spend 3-5 extra years editing your next book if you can't control the urge to write another one. I got this book as a tie-in but still felt ripped-off!"
1,A Waste of Money,"What an absolutely boring read. There was nothing mysterious, nor was there even anything remotely interesting in this book. But somehow I plowed on through hoping that something interesting would happen. Nothing did. Save your money. Save your time."
2,Don't Waste Your Time - It Isn't Worth It,"The most disappointing book I've read in quite a while. Cardboard characters combine with an okay plot to create a book that invites your mind to wander while reading it. And then you arrive at one of the most contrived endings imaginable. The writing was fair, the pacing poor, and the 'puzzle-solving' would make Will Shortz cringe. Despite the hype and high sales, do yourself a favor and avoid this book. Instead, pick up The Shadow of the Wind by Carlos Zafon.Also recommended: The Shadow of the Wind by Carlos Zafon."
2,Misleading,"Since this book was touted as being another DaVinci Code I bought it. It ended up being a memoir of college days with a weak thread of a renaissance mystery woven into it.The story is not what you would think by the back cover(partial quote) ""If Scott Fitzgerald, Umberto Eco and Dan Brown teamed up to write a novel, the result would be The Rule of Four"".Do not be fooled by the hype! If you like a fairly well-written book about college relationships this book is for you.I would also like to point out to the authors that the death sentence of ""Hung, drawn and quartered"" does not mean the victim was hung then drawn behind a cart before being cut into four pieces. The victim was in fact, partially hung, drawn, which means partially disemboweled then cut into quarters either by being pulled apart by four horses or otherwise dismembered. They must have missed the movie Braveheart where William Wallace was put to death in this manner.Very dissapointing."
1,Holden Caulfield Goes to Princeton,"That should have been the title of this collection of college student angst. I fell for the publication hype, and knew I had made a mistake after 20 pages. This book bears no resemblence to ""The Divinci Code"" in either story line or character development. Besides telling me more about Princeton than I would ever want to know, the authors (in their obvious arrogance for their alma mater)allow this sideshow to interfere with the pace of the story. Finally, they cop out on the one interesting part of the story, the quest to uncover the secret of the book. The book jacket says they started writing ""The Rule of Four"" in 1998. Their effort did not age well like a fine wine."
4,Intriguing,"I liked the book. If anything, I would have liked to see it longer. It was well written and kept my attention. I, too, have read Da Vinci Code and Angels and Demons. The only similarity was that the Renaissance was part of the story. The book was intriguing. I would definitely recommend it to those who like the above mentioned books, but I would never use it as a comparison. That would be like saying apples taste like oranges because they are both fruit."
3,Harry Potter at Princeton,"The blurb on the back of the book equates it to a collaboration of Scott Fitzgerald, Umberto Eco, and Dan Brown. A Princeton setting is all that it shares with Fitzgerald. Old traditions might stir nostalgia in old Tigers, but for those of us with other alma maters, they were mostly boring. The only tenuous tie with Eco is an involvement with a recondite Medieval text. As for Brown, the Hypnerotomachia Polaphili lacks the cachet of the Holy Grail or the Last Supper, and Francesco Colonna is far less fascinating than Mary Magdalene. There was nothing that really grabbed my interest. It didn't help that the least attractive character is the protagonist/narrator, Tom.If the book evoked any author for me, it was J.K. Rawlings. Readable, but not remarkable."
2,Rule of Four,"I agree with most of the other opinions I have read. It is a great idea for a book, but it is poorly written. The interaction between the two main characters, Paul and Tom, is very stale and their reactions to the events of the book which are pretty life altering events, are emotionless and plain, the authors couldn't have made me care less. The dialog between the college students is not believable in the least, and the narrative as told by the main character, Tom, is awful. The only thing that saves this book is the information on the ancient text Tom and Paul are uncovering, which should intrigue any history buff."
2,"Good idea, but...","The premise is captivating but the writing and plot leave much to be desired. Vonnegut has a rule: if a sentence does not advance the plot, it does not belong. These two would do well to learn and apply that rule before starting their next project."
1,Ignore the Hype!,"This book gets hyped and I was led to believe it is something like Umberto Ecco or Dan Brown. It is most certainly neither. I wanted to like this book, but it was just a bad experience. The Hypnerotomchica mystery is only a short part of the book, utterly superficial and most of all more than unbelievable. If you are interested in endless descriptions of Princeton campus life or of problems between a dead father and a son who rather has dates with his girlfriend than working on a far fetched mystery, then you might like this book. Otherwise it simply sucks."
1,2nd worst book I ever read,"Besides Twilight, this is the worst book I ever read. Pretentious dribble, written by men that think their day-to-day experiences in college were so fascinating. Oh yeah, and there's a mystery that makes no sense and characters that suck."
3,Worth a trip to the library,"I read all the reviews and discounted them a bit too much. This is definitely a coming-of-age story, well, more of a dry, college-age story that just happens to have a little historical puzzle as a subplot. Didn't care much for the characters or the story - I just wanted to learn more about the Rule of Four, but there wasn't much to be had of that. Wish I hadn't bought it and had just gone to the library..."
2,Not like Da Vinci Code,"Rule of Four could've been much better as I think the writers are very talented. The first half, even three quarters, is knee deep in Princeton lore, which gets old fast. The characters are well developed, but the review of renaissance history was a little tedious. The last quarter of the book is great, but you have to get through the first 3/4. If you're looking for another Da Vinci code, this isn't it."
3,Bad PUBLISHERS!,"The book was okay read. But the publishers really hurt it! These idiots blabbering on about The Da Vinci Code in the advertising. Of course they set everbody up for a dissapointment. The two books couldn't be more different. It is a pity that these two authors with such good potential took on such a poor, short-sighted publisher."
2,"Great core, but lousy filler","I loved the premise of this book. It sounded like an intellectual thriller. Everything that revolved around the Hypnerotomachia was fascinating. However, it was lost in so much filler. The filler consisted of flat characters and more history on Princeton than I ever cared to know about. Finally, the chapters seemed utterly unrelated to each other as they skipped back and forth awkwardly."
3,"1/3 Juvenille, 1/3 Psychotic, 1/3 Intriguing","The writing is OK, but it is obviously written by young men. They took an interesting Davinci Code type concept and ran with it, but the characters's obsession to solve the ""puzzle"" just gets insane, bordering on silly. The characters aren't incredibly well developed, nor are they overwhelmingly likeable. I don't hate myself for reading it, but I'd only recommend it to people who read a lot and don't mind a rest from better, more thoughtful works. Don't expect to be wowed."
1,Terrible.,"This is the worst book I have read all year. It is not anything at all like ""The Da Vinci Code"", nor is it interesting or even well written. It seemed mainly to be an outlet for a couple of college kids (who both failed Composition 101), as a means of describing their tedious and boring relationships with other teenagers. After 20 pages of slight interest, a possible engaging storyline developed which was responsible for my finishing the book. I kept hoping it would get better; much to my chagrin, it did not."
1,Boring Redefined,"The book as a whole was rather tedious to get through. A lot of characters were introduced quickly near the beginning of the book and were never really developed until later chapters. I felt no connection with any of the characters. The `buddy' aspect of the book suffered considerably because for the first half the book I had little to no clue as to who the characters were.The writing/editing was sloppy in places. The sentence structure was often clumsy. I came across several typo/spelling/syntax errors while reading it. It is apparent there are two different authors involved in the writing as you read it. Sentence structure, tempo and context shifts are apparent between the two.If I were Dan Brown, I would be a little perturbed that someone compared ""The Rule of Four"" with any of my work."
1,Zzzzzz,The Rule of Four deals a lot with breaking codes to review the truth. So if you want to know more about this book you'll have to break my code.BORING + SLOW + BAD WRITING = THE RULE OF FOUR
3,Mediocre...save for a rainy day,"Somewhat predictable and a bit slow at times. Could have done a lot more with the story. If you have nothing else to do, it's a fast read and may keep you pre-occupied on a long flight."
4,"Forget the rule of hour, the code is better.","The first thing I can say about this book, is that you will like it when you get to page 120 or 150. During these first 120 pages or so, the books only hints at what is going on. Starting around page 125 you start to get an idea about the secret hidden in the Hypnertomachia, a book from the end of the 15th century.I have to admit that there is character development in this book but at the expense of the mystery and the action. Also the secret hidden in this book pales in comparision to the secret hidden in the code."
3,Entertaining,"Very entertaining but fell short of expectations. The premise of the book seemed to get lost in all of the Princeton history and culture - which seems it could be a novel unto itself. I enjoyed it more that the DeVinci Code yet the formula could have been used to solve the mystery of Latrobe ""33"" on the Rolling Rock beer bottle. Great first novel and I would read these guys again. If you like the genre read Eco."
1,YUCK,Makes me wonder why this book is in the top 100. I much prefered the book A Brush with Darkness by Lisa Fittipaldi which was inspirational AND well written.
1,Completely Overhyped by Publishers,"Utterly terrible. Nothing like a Dan Brown book or Umberto Eco as the publishers suggest. Not suspenseful at all, and the writers spend far too much time developing unmemorable characters."
1,Undergraduate Musings,"The Rule of Four is largely an exercise for the authors to demonstrate everything they learned at college. It spends too much time on the long, pointless and poorly-written background story of the main characters and far too little on the ""intriguing intellectual suspense novel"" it is advertised to be."
2,Nothing really interesting happens until page 135,"I must say, the boys must have gotten themselves a rockin' good publicist to have this disappointing 'thriller' so far up the charts so quickly. It is no Da Vinci Code. It is not even Digital Fortress. It is certainly not as ""If Scott Fitzgerald, Umberto Eco and Dan Brown have teamed up to write a novel, the result would be The Rule of Four"" as stated on the cover."
2,Damn Boring Frat boy yarn,I picked up this book thinking that it would turn out to be a real page-turner with some real good puzzles like DaVinci Code (atleast the title page claims it is similar to it). But it turned out to be a boring book with lots of paper wasted on writing about the characters ( what the authors do is not character development but kill time and trees) and less about the actual plot. The actual plot about the book can be condensed to about 150 pages and the rest of the book is pure fluff. The book starts well and then goes downhill. The puzzles are also not to the level of Dan Brown's in DaVinci Code and Angels&Demons. If you like to read how frat boys in Princeton live then pick up this book. If you dont want to read that then stay away. I wish I had done that.
2,Wasted Minutes,I just hate it when I waste precious time on a knucklehead book. This was one. I couldn't have cared less about these pretentious characters.
1,Difficult to understand the reported success of this book,"I read the book because of the nice promotion phrase ""the Da vinci code for the intellectuals"" (not to say I am an intellectual, though),and had some time available. But the book is quite dull, boring and badly written if not for the thesis work in it which can be quite interesting ""per se"".I am happy that two students could make money out of their work, but that's the most I can say.I don't understand why some bad books become best-sellers and other excellent ones are hardly noticed, instead.For me, the real message of this book is that it's frankly worrying to see how life in an american campus can be: spoiled and self-contained."
2,"The end is better than expected, but still not a good book","I had a lot of hope for this book since it was so overhyped. I won't repeat all the negative comments by the other reviewers but I want to emphasize the following:1) the character development is very poor and, in particular, the rendering of the relationship of the narrator with his girlfriend is just downright childish;2) the chronological development is unconvincing and I had to keep checking if so much of the main action was really taking place in one night (I know there were flashbacks);3) if you do care about the Princeton details, the arbitrary changes to the real campus and activities are extremely annoying. If they wanted to modify the university environment so much, they should have just created an imaginary place. Whatever they gained by tying the action to a real place, they lost by the silly and inane modifications.Save your money and time - read another book."
2,A total mess,"It was a long boring agony. People were comparing this with DaVinci Code? Please! There is no comparison here. Painfully, I finished the book and still I don't understand the purpose of it or what was really the plot here. It was disorganized and clueless. The authors shoould not quit their real jobs. Don't waste your time."
2,Rule of Four Lacks Edginess,"I agree with all of the negative reviews: flat characters, weak dialogue, lack of any real suspense. I loved the connection to Savonarola, but the authors really did not develop the outrage and fear that motivated the Hypnerotomachia's author. What a waste! If you want to read a fantastic depiction of late 15th century Florence, try Romola by George Eliot."
2,How did this get published?,It's not often I'm compelled to read a book with a red pen in hand so I can cross out each misused word or to correct the factual errors in the margin. These appear on nearly every page. Did the editor have a tin ear? Has Random House laid off its factcheckers? This is an ambitious and earnestly written book that simply overreached. First novels are like that. But I can only believe that the critics swooned for the Matt and Ben of the literary thriller world.
2,No DaVinci code here,"I don't know folks. I found this book to be slow, dry and repetitive. The basic idea was very interesting but it was not well developed.The story had great potential but it never quite made it. I would not recommend this book."
1,most disappointing...,"This is a very disappointing read!!! I find it too tedious to read - the storyline is not focused, it goes too much into describing the nitty-gritty of the characters' lives...yet at the same time, I can't seem to connect with them. I don't see any point in describing them at all. I'm only half-way reading the book, and it feels like squeezing blood from stone...One of the driest and boring book I've ever read (and I've read many a best-seller)."
2,Disappointing unfortunately,"I read this on a flight back and forth to the east coast and it put me to sleep the first trip. The second was way more entertaining. I found the first 200-300 pages slow and underproductive. Far too much time was spent trying to develop the past relationship Tom had with his father and with his current girlfriend.Paul did not get quite enough time in my eyes, as he was the main person struggling with the decoding. I did like the extra two characters, but honestly, their arguements had nothing to do with the story or growth of the main two.Now the actual Hypnerotomachia sections were alive and brought you back in. The saving grace was that the authors tossed tiny crumbs as you went along just to make sure you finished the whole book and didn't skip ahead. I would have prefered a short story of 100-150 pages over the whole thing.As often as I pick up just any book at random and usually enjoy it, this one left me wondering why I was seeing Best Sellers list on the cover"
1,I'll never know how I got through it,"I envy those of you who can put down a book when they've decided it's not worth reading. I've never been able to do that. Maybe it's a form of obsessive compulsive disorder but, once I start a book, I have to finish it - - no matter how tedious it is. And, tedious does no even begin to describe how painful it was to get through this. There is no need to repeat the negative comments already written by others, so I won't. But, it told a story I didn't care about, lived by characters I didn't care about. By the time I was 3/4 through the book, I honestly didn't care whether they solved the puzzle, lived, died, whatever..."
1,Awful,"Billed as a mystery. In actuality, badly-written ivy-league frat-lit: highlighting college ""eating clubs"", frat rites, luxury cars, and one-dimensional badasses from the wild, incestuous world of academia. Solipsism and mediocrity writ large.I bought this book on impulse, on a rainy evening. I just wanted to quickly pick up a good (well, adequate) read. Silly me: I've cursed every book I've bought on the NY Times bestseller paperback list. Add this one to the score.(And how DOES junk like this get on the NY times bestseller list? Just wondering...)"
1,Bored,I want to stop reading this book. I'm bored. The characters seem stereotyped. And nothing interesting happens. What happens is not believable. It feels childlike in style.
1,What a stinker,"I read this book after being told it was in the genre of the DaVinci Code. I just never found it to be engaging at all. The mystery the friends set out to solve didn't interest me in the least. The solution was improbable and unsatisfying. The friendship of the ""four"" was also just not of interest to me. I can see that alumni of Princeton would like this book since it is set on campus and contains many quirky (though again very uninteresting) details about life on that campus. I do have to say that I finished the book, although it was one of those ""this just has to get better"" quests that went unfulfilled."
1,Juvenile,"Based on the write-ups in the press, including the New York Times, I believed that this was one of those great stories of first-time writers capturing the essence of a genre.Instead, I am the not-so-proud owner of a thin, juvenile work of two self-absorbed pseudo-intellectuals. You can almost feel the smirks that they must have made as they described the steam tunnels and nude Olympics of Princeton. You can almost taste the sense of superiority that they must have experienced writing dialog that points out the misquoting of Hobbes.The thrill of a great Liberal Arts education is the thrill of elite trivia. Esoteric textual references are the Lingua Franca of the group.But clique-y lingo does not make a story. And this story grows tedious quickly.Save your money."
1,What an awful and amateurish book,Do not buy this book. Instead do what I did and check it out of the library. You will be glad you did because this book reads like something out of a 3 day novel writing contest sponsored by Brittany Murphy. this might be of interest to juveniles but hardly measures up to the constant comparisons to Umberto Eco and even the pop cultch flavour of the year wonderkind Dan Brown. I only gave it one star because there were no half stars. I would give it a half star because I like the cover.
1,Painful,"Like other reviewers I stopped reading half way. The authors couldn't make up their mind whether to write an antiquarian story, a college story, or a mystery. These strains are in no way intertwined. Everything that happens is totally unlikely. For instance, a person is murdered and no one goes to find out who and who did it. Or: Preoccupied about one room mate's fate, a student goes first lecturing about Roman topography in the middle of the night. The girlfriend of the first person narrator shows up from time to time and is not involved in the actions - is this Princeton undergrad love? The Princeton professor of Renaissance is named Taft, and of course the reader is induced to think of Anthony (Tony) GrAFTon. But none of the characteristics of Taft apply to Grafton. This is painful undergraduate creative writing."
2,Not even close,"Not what you would expect in a comparison to Dan Brown's works. Slow and dragging in the beginning and never got its legs under it. A good introduction to ""The Book"" for those who never knew it existed.."
2,Better than a sharp stick in the eye.......but not by much,"I bought this book, like many others, after being led to believe it was similar to 'The DaVinci Code'. I was hoodwinked! This book jumps around alot and is difficult to follow. I kept thinking, ""if I had attended Princeton I would have really liked this book."" The book is more about the quirks of Princeton life then a real mystery. I felt obligated to finish the book since I spent the money on a hardback...........but it was a let down. My advice........save your money!"
3,Not in the same league with The Da Vinci Code,"After reading all of the reviews, I decided to hop on the Rule of Four bandwagon. Professional reviews indicated that this book was true ""literature,"" implying that the Da Vinci Code was not. I was somewhat taken aback since I truly enjoyed the Da Vinci Code. So, in an attempt to elevate my literary choices, I purchased this book. I still can't figure out why everyone liked this book so much. I found the plot to be superficial in that it focused more on the characters than the actual mystery surrounding the ancient text that consumed their lives. The Rule of Four is simply ""ok"" in my view. If you are in search of suspense and mystery, this is not the book for you."
3,Dieappointing,"I agree with an earlier reviewer, the book suffers from pointless descriptions of college life, and I failed to relate to any of the characters. I guess I am, at 56, too old for this type of book, although I found the Da Vinci Code enjoyable.Nice try, but didn't work for me."
1,THIS STINKS,This book was the biggest disappointment. Boring story....wooden characters.....curious plot........plodding dialogue. etc. I expected something akin to the DaVinci Code and this book was marketed similarly....but what a miss. Do not waste your time.
1,My neighbor advised me not to bother finishing the book...,"I should have listened to my neighbor. I kept waiting for this book to get good. It just didn't. The premise sounded neat, that's why I bought it. But after plowing through to the end I just couldn't figure out why I was supposed to like the main character... or any of his friends for that matter. The authors fail to develop depth in any of the characters and thus never sufficiently explain why the central manuscript holds such interest for those involved with it.The book reads like a novel written by 13 year olds (and average ones at that).Do not waste your time or money on this book."
1,Not Ready for Primetime Fiction,"This book is seriously awful. I cannot believe that an editor thought this book was ready to go to press. The basic problem is the structure of the book -- the storyline meanders all over the place because apparently no one thought about the best way to structure the narrative. Second, characterization is just non-existent. Third, the writing is simply pedestrian. Fourth, the solution to the puzzle is more than a let-down. It is flat and uninvolving.The germ of an interesting intellectual thriller is in this book -- but the authors seem to be more interested in showing that an Ivy League education is worth the money than in actually making the very real effort involved in writing an intellectual thriller. Perhaps they need to read a little more Umberto Eco (for plot) and Wilkie Colllins (for characterization) and a little less Nelson DeMille and Dan Brown."
2,"Not awful, but doesn't deserve the hype","This book has been hyped up as the better written Da Vinci Code, but as I consider myself a reader of good books who occasionally enjoys a guilty pleasure (which I consider the Da Vinci code to be), I was really disappointed by this book as it did not appeal to me on any level. Well written? Well... it's not terrible, but there's much better literature out there. Gripping mystery/suspense novel? Not that, either. The book doesn't pull you in, and you don't really care what happens to the main characters one way or the other. A lot of fuss is made about how this novel is based on a complicated real book, but seen as the authors don't really make any advances on its study and just make up all of their ""discoveries"", so the book isn't even interesting on that level!!In conclusion, rather disappointing..."
1,Limping over the Shark,"We have just one rule in our book club: If you want to drink wine with the group, you've got to finish the book. It's powerful incentive, obviously.Make no mistake: The Rule of Four is no DaVinci Code. The only real intrigue presents itself in the epilogue. It's a little bit DaVinci-esque, but it's far too little and far too late; by that time, it just seems like a preposterous bit of reverse shark-jumping. The characters are so poorly drawn that it's possible to distinguish one from another only by physical descriptions; a real author would not have felt required to keep reminding us how big and black Charlie is and how small and slight Paul is. And throughout I was haunted by the burning question: Does Princeton have some special legal dispensation that allows for such free-flowing liquor at undergrad functions?The book club meeting starts in two hours, and I am ready for that glass of wine. I've really earned it this time."
2,undergraduate literature,"Erudite? Riveting? Poignant? For whom? Also misled by the Times (why do we continue to listen?), I picked this up to read in the country, when I had unlimited attention to devote to what I hoped would be fun and cerebral, layered and full of arcana. Instead, Rule of Four was boring when it was not pretentious, full of the wisdom of the newly degreed who haven't yet experienced much of life, mystery, work or -- quite clearly -- intimacy.However, the authors are talented and really precocious. I will be interested in seeing their work when they grow up."
2,Drivel,"I wanted to be fair, and I've read 82 pages. I can't push myself to read more, because it's just drivel about four Princeton seniors, the one senior narrator's father, several professors and some damn 500-year old book that only a handful of people in the whole world know about. With apologies to the authors and the book snobs at The New York Times who loved it, I just don't care to spend any more of my life reading this book. Two stars is generous. I'll get back to a sure thing by Robert Crais or Harlan Coben or John Lescroart or Michael Connelly or Lee Child or John Sandford or Brian Haig or P.T. Deutermann or Vince Flynn or any one of a dozen other novelists who will keep me turning pages."
1,Not worth the time it took to read,It appears that the authors of this book were attempting to cash in on the popularity of The DaVinci Code but have failed miserably in their effort. This is a story with a weak plot and flat characters. It is the tale of how some Princeton undergraduates solve a 500 year old mystery that has eluded experts for generations. It appears more focused on describing the various buildings on the Princeton University campus than it does on developing the story line or adding depth to the characters to try to make them seem more real.The only reason I read it was because I was stuck on a plane and had little choice. In retrospect I should have read the Sky Mall catalog. At least I might have seen something interesting.
2,A Beautifully Wrapped Stinker,"As others have pointed out here, some of the writing in this book is brilliant. Unfortunately, none of it applies to the ""plot,"" and I use the term loosely. The two villains seem interchangeable to me, so much so that I got them confused. The laborious business about life at Princeton merely got in the way of the story. The murders encountered by the protagonists are glossed over, as if such events are everyday experiences, and the police investigations were explained away with a sentence or two.It was also hard to keep track of the story/backstory, with the narrative jumping around from flashbacks to the present.A lot of people are making money on the success of The Da Vinci Code. These two fledgling authors are doing the same. If they have a multi-book contract, I'll be interested to see if they develop more writing muscle in the future."
3,Strong plot throughout but...,"I had high aspirations for this first novel by Caldwell and Thomason and they did not completely let me down. The plot was well written and I felt the characters were well developed to a point, but the jumps between Paul's and Tom's background and the storyline was confusing. I understand that the authors wanted to fill us in on historical information related to the storyline, like the history of the Princeton clubs, or how Tom and Katie met, but the transitions between the past and present were choppy. At one point, I lost the book's timeline after Tom and Paul's search in Stein's office. Next thing I knew, the story jumps back to the Tom and Katie romance then several months ahead to explain Tom's contribution to Paul's thesis and why it nearly ruined his relationship with everyone around him. Maybe I'm just used to reading novels with smoother transitions between past and present but the jumps in this novel became increasingly annoying."
4,Intelligence and heart in a coming of age drama -,"No, not really a thriller or in the mystery genre, but I really got a kick out of this book. The subject was obscure but that does not make it inaccessible; in fact the authors make a generous point of unveiling the Hypnerotomachia to the uninitiated. For anyone who went from being the brightest star at their high school to being one of an ocean of bright stars at an Ivy League college, the characters and their relationships will ring very true. The only females in the book are hollow and petty (and superfluous), but as the book is written as a first-person narration by a male college student, I think that's entirely appropriate! The main girl in his life actually calls him on that at one point and rings 100% true. This is NOT the adrenaline-rush of a Dan Brown freefall, but a thoughtful and sometimes suspenseful account of a post-adolescent reassessment of life's priorities. Wordy, not for the impatient, but nicely-read and sweetly engaging."
1,The worst book I have ever read fully,"After checking out the summary on the back cover, I felt this book would be a great follow up to Dan Brown. Nothing could be further from reality. Having actually endured the entire book, I now feel that the only possibly enigmatic and remotely interesting part was the name of the Renaissance book ""Hynerotomachia Poliphili"". The book alternates between laborious and terribly boring passages of life at Princeton and an incredibly slow paced quest for some very mysterious secret. Enduring and fighting though the tedium of the Princeton passages, I was hoping to find some worthwhile secret unveiled at the end. Not to be! Rule of Four a complete let down. I would not even recommend it as a paper weight for which it is truly fit considering its girth."
2,Less than I was expecting,"The premise for this novel moved me to eagerly await its arrival in the mail. I really wanted it to be good, and kept plodding through the choppy writing, flat characters, and pointless relationship angst. The ending did provide a measure of satisfaction, but I can't say it made up for the tedious hours leading up to it. I'm being generous with two stars."
1,This was really bad,"The story was smarmy and almost 100% exposition. For every 1 line of action you get 100 lines of back story. The narrative is constantly interupted with unsympathetic characters and ill conceived ""mysteries"". Seriously - save you money."
4,Please judge this book on its own merits!!,"I felt compelled to write a review when I looked at the very low rating for this book. Sure enough, when I look at the one-star reviews it is what I feared. It's fans of the DaVinci Code looking for something just like that. The Rule of Four is a good book--on its own merit. It deals with looking for ciphers in a Renaissance text. It's an academic suspense novel. Do not look for a rehashing of the DaVinci Code (which I did like, by the way). This book (the Rule of Four) is better written. The prose is better, and the characters are MUCH better drawn.I enjoyed the look into Princeton and the academic competition and way of life there. I found the deciphering of the Renaissance book fascinating. If you're looking for something just like the DaVinci code, do not expect it here. The tone and pace of this book is different. Some aspects, such as solving a puzzle, are similar. But Rule of Four is its own book. Give it a chance. Judge it on its own merits."
2,i got this book for free and i still want my money back,"nice try, but poorly executed. the premise of high crime on princeton campus needs a better motive. the whole thing was just too implausible to be taken seriously. plus, the overly romanticized ivy-league images were a turn off. an extra dose of reality and a shot of action could have saved the story. still, there were clever parts that showed thorough research. all in all two thumbs down."
2,Eh....,A Dan Brown esque novel that isn't near that level. Maybe my expectations were too high after reading Dan's four novels.
2,semi scholarship,"Although based on the premise of a real book of clandestine meaning, the race to unlock its secrets was not terribly interesting. There was little of the intellectual ""meat"" found in Umberto Eco or even Dan Brown. Interesting factoids were too few, and although character development was deeper and richer than in the Da Vinci Code, the characters were not particularly apealling to me. One for the weekend at the beach."
1,A Clever mix of a Boring Book and Good Marketing,"It's difficult to add another one-star review, but it should be be done until this book's rating is brought down to a deserved level. The people who made Fabian a rock star in the 50's and Britney Spears a diva now must have been retained to foist this book onto a best-seller list. The two authors spent several YEARS writing it in their basement? They must have been playing video games. The author testimonials on the back are nothing less than perpetrating fraud on potential buyers. This isn't a horrible book. It's simply average or less-than-average among the thousands of books published each year."
1,I feal used!!!!,This book is one of the worst books I have ever purchased. Page 245 and I can't stand even to read one more page. If you can return the book do so.
1,sophomoric,"What were those professional reviewers reading...the ones who gave this book such great reviews? It couldn't have been this. Or are they paid by the publisher to write nice things about such tedious, constipated stories?I got as far as the first illustrations before giving up."
1,I am still in a daze...,"..after reading forty-four pages of this pretentious tosh. In fact, I was stupified, numbed so much that I was unable to read further. And, after looking at so many other readers' reviews, I appear to have made a good call. I felt The DaVinci code unravelled somewhat, but it was a rivetting read. This book is not.What has happened to our faculties of literary criticism, which have ridiculously propelled this palpable nonsense into the best-seller lists? Clearly, Barnum was wrong. There is not one, but hundreds born every minute.Harvard should have courses on basic book-writing and story-telling skills, for they are missing here.Do not buy this book. Unless, of course, you are an incurable insomniac. It is your ultimate salvation."
1,Don't believe the hype,I was so incredibly disappointed in this book I felt bad for the time I wasted reading it. The fact that this book is even mentioned in the same sentence as Davinci Code is insulting to Dan Brown and anyone who enjoyed the intelligence of that book. This book fails on every level that Davinci succeeded on and I highly recommend you not waste your time finding out.
1,Slow going campus mystery plot,"I picked up this book because everyone tauted it as the other ""Da Vinci Code"" but it had almost no similarities and the historical clues it offered of the ancient Renaissance text were neither as provocative or interesting as from The Da Vinci Code.I actually stopped reading for a while because the story plowed along so laboriously! If I would have known, I would have saved my money."
3,Solid but a little light on plot & mystery.,"I enjoyed this book. It is well written and I have always enjoyed the ""mysteries are buried in the past"" type books. The mystery is not something that the reader is allowed to participate in, which is a pity. The ending is visible from a great distance away and at least three of the last chapters could have been cut without affecting the book at all. Still it is witty enough and engaging enough for me to keep reading even when I know what's coming."
2,"Interesting Pieces, Poorly Assembled","The Rule of Four is entertaining, and could have been a great book, but it fails largely by trying to cram too many elements into the story and never really using any to fullest advantage. Have a feeling that these young authors will someday look back on this work with embarrassment -- but hope they try again as there is definitely promise for one or both to be excellent writers.The book suffers from sloppy explication (too much at times, too little at otheres) and some really unfortunate cliche plot elements, the worst being in the final chapter.Overall, it seems like what you might predict would be the result when two very smart recent college grads take six years to co-author a novel ..."
1,disappointed,"very disappointed by this book. No plot, no suspense. It took me two weeks to read it while books from Brown, Cusler or Clancy are read within a few days.mislead by the ranking, can i have my money back? :))"
5,the rule of four,"This is an intelligent, suspenseful reading from a refreshing perspective, of scholarly college students whose undergraduate pursuits far more noble than their advisors'; of friendship, love, ethics and the insatiable thirst for an ancient knowledge that spans generations and comes full-circle. It is a relief that this book does not include the usual crude sexual scenery that most books now think they must have; instead love is described poetically, and eroticism from the mystigue of pursuits."
3,A fun read.,"having never read any other 'academic thrillers', i thought this book was a lot of fun; was pleasantly surprised by the writing. the ending was not super satisfying, or i'd have given it a 4th star. i didn't hate the ending, just found it to be a little forced - or something. caldwell & thomason are clever with words, but has built a plot that moves decently."
2,Boring,"This is a book that I started out with a lot of high expectations. Murder, strange ciphers in an old text, intrigue and deception. I thought I was getting it with this book but it was a bore. By half way through the book I realized that there was NOTHING going on in the story. I struggled on hoping for a climax and none came. I thought this book was terrible. I think I would have more fun and interest reading the Hypnerotomachia myself. It would be more interesting. The characters were wooden with none clearly defining themselves at any point. It seemed as if if was written for a teenage audience. I give it two stars because the author really had a great premise to tie a fictional story in with the Hypnerotomachia. I now would like to read it myself and if it wasn't for them I probably would never have heard of it. But, other than that, this novel was rubbish."
2,worst New York Times bestseller I've ever read,"I wanted to like this book. I really did. Even after not being moved by the first half of the book, I gave it the benefit of the doubt and finished it believing things would get better. Turns out, I just wasted my time.I had hoped it would be something like a Dan Brown novel, especially after reading a quote on the back cover by The New York Times Book Review praising The Rule of Four as ""the ultimate puzzle book."" In reality, solving the Hypnerotomachia wasn't a major plot line, but rather a backdrop of sorts.A line at the top of the front cover reads, ""500 Years Ago the First Men Were Murdered to Protect the Secret."" This led me to believe that there would be secret societies and mysterious murders throughout the book ala Da Vinci Code, but this also turned out to be false hope as well.The Rule of Four basically centers around the college lives of the main character and his three friends, all of whom you do not give a damn about due to poor writing."
4,More than just suspense,"The Rule of Four is a very interesting take on the typical ""scholars obsessed with an ancient puzzle"" plot, because the book grapples not only with the quest itself, but on the toll that the obsession takes on the family and relationships of the protagonists. There is a whole new dimension beyond the frantic need to solve an ancient riddle, which asks whether the nut is worth cracking at all.Some reviewers seem to find this extra layer distracting, and it does slow the pace of the book. Personally, I found it fascinating."
4,Nice Read,"I thought that this book was quite a good read. I liked all the very interesting details of school life, characters, and the main subject: the book. I loved the characters and I felt like I knew each one by the end of the book. I like historical-action novels and this one did not dissapoint!"
3,Not bad but don't compare toThe Da Vinci Code,"I read this book during a reading frenzy started by reading The Da Vinci Code. Not a bad good, actually quite enjoyable but when it was slow, it was REALLY SLOW. The story was good, most of the characters were interesting but at times it lagged and it was hard to regain the pace. I would recommend it if you are in need of something to keep you going while you wait for the new Dan Brown but don't expect the same as Da Vinci."
1,this book is overhyped crap,"boy do publishers like to cash in. ""people"" compare this to ""great writing."" then people are really stupid. Where does that leave the thirty nine steps, sign of the four(please note the steal of the title), eye of the needle, marathon man, or writers like john mcdonald. robert parker, and grisham. this is the american idol version of a good thriller."
3,Indistinctly average.,"An odd book, uncomfortably walking the tightrope between ""historical"" and ""thriller"" and then failing to be historically relevant, or thrilling. The parts about the text the students are working on are fun. The rest of the plot just seems silly, and I couldn't bring myself to care a tinker's cuss about the outcome. Better than TdVC, but you still don't have to use your brain. In fact, you are a lot better off if you don't!"
1,**********Tedious*************,"I should have known better than to think a ""copy cat"" book could come close to the brilliance of the DaVinci Code. This one certainly didn't. It was just plain tedious. I thought about quitting the book altogether when it droned on, but I'm too cheap and figured since I bought it, I needed to finish it. I ended up scanning and skipping pages upon pages at a time. I would not recommend this book."
3,"All that fuss, over what?","This book seemed to want to be like The DaVinci Code with mysteries hidden that would reveal great secrets if only they could be figured out. However it lacks the excitement of that book, and also the subject seems a bit too obscure to cause all the drama that took place in the plot, anyway.The characters are pretty good, and the story isn't too bad, but it's just hard to believe that so much would go on surrounding such an obscure uninteresting (to most people) subject. Also, the authors jump around too much with the timeline and at some points it isn't clear if you are reading past or present events in the story. It also seems like the same information is presented over and over again as Tom looks back on his father's struggles.Not a bad book, but not one I would recommend very highly."
4,Nothing like Da Vinci but an engaging plot,"The author is effective in developing the characters and expressing the relationship between the 4 roommates. There is a bit of suspense but there is too much focus on the story of the characters. The concept behind the book ""rule of four"" and the ""Hypnerotomachia"" is very interesting but the author spends very little time on this.If you're looking for a good story, you will find it, but the learning of the main concept ""Hypnerotomachia"" is compromised."
3,A good first effort,"With The Rule of Four, Ian Caldwell and Dustin Thomason struck paydirt on their first try. This book is interesting but it would have benefitted from a good edit to cut out some of the boring parts. Some have compared it to The Da Vinci Code. Frankly, it is not in the same league.The two friends Paul and Tom, who are involved in deciphering the codes embedded in the 500-year-old the Hypnerotomachia Poliphili, are likeable characters. You get interested in their story but then the plot meanders for a while before coming back on track. In many ways the book has all the right ingredients but the authors are not yet quite adept at putting them together.I look forward to their next novel to see whether they can improve on this good first effort."
1,what the????,I finished this book and wanted the time back that I wasted reading it! I guess it would be a good read for someone who is in to LIGHT reading but with so many other great summer books out there why bother!
1,"not very good, frankly","Despite the mountains of hype that this book has generated - mysteriously - it turns out to be a rambling, flacid thriller with glancing pretensions to scholarship. The details that are evoked most lovingly, like life in Princeton dining clubs, are of interest only to those who experienced them. It's like being trapped at a dinner party with a bunch of recent Princeton grads remembering the good old days, and unconvincingly attempting to inflate the mundane details of Princeton life into something transcendent. As for the mystery and the celebrated puzzle-solving in the plot, there are one or two neat twists, but mostly it has been done better elsewhere. The writers are talented, but green. I do not think their publishers have done them a favor by conflating this early effort into a best-selling event. It is only likely to make more difficult the writing of the truly good book that may still be within their grasp."
2,Positively Painful,"We had a friend over from Australia who raved about The Rule of Four. I am a fan of Angels and Demons by Dan Brown, and he handed me this book saying they ""don't even compare."" Well, they DON'T. I felt like I was trudging through a swamp with army boots. This book went nowhere and everywhere at the same time. I finished this book out of obligation to my friend and just to see if I missed the big picture. After reading other reviews I am relieved that I am not alone in this sentiment."
1,How about half a star,"Like one of the reviewers here, I bought the book without reading online customer reviews..and boy, oh boy, I really regretted the purchase. I really really tried to read it, but it is so meandering, so loosely put together in terms of plot that eventually I gave up and moved on to Peter Hamilton's Pandora's Star (3x thicker and more interesting). Ok, ok, they are different genres, but hey, a good book is a good read. Rule of Four is imho, disappointing, despite starting off well."
2,four yawns,"I couldn't finish this book, gave up just after half way through. It's far too slow to develop any serious suspense. The writing struck me as somewhat pretentious. The characters don't have much depth. Really quite disappointing."
2,"Great beginning, poor development, lousy end","Like many readers, I got hooked by this book's great introduction, which turned out to be one of the few highlights. The pedantic storyline fails to catch the reader's interest, and the two main characters - too obviously the authors' alter egos - are flat, and live their lives at 20+ with a pathos one would hardly find in a 70-year-old ex-con.A few things in there are worth saving, such as the Hypnerotomachia subject itself and the underlying historical background. A better writer would have turned this raw material into a major success.This is a so-so first for the book's young authors and I wish them success. I just hope they will not repeat the mistakes they made in this book - too many to list - and that they will not write their next novel at the same pace: 6 years by some accounts, and about as long to read it. Many of us may may no longer be around when they are done."
2,Terribly boring and predictable,"I was fooled by the synopsis on the back page into thinking that this would be an interesting book.It was a very dull read and the outcomes were very predictable.The only point of interest was about the book being investigated. Unfortunately it dragged on abit and held little suspense.What was promised to be a big revelation in solving the mystery turned out to be something not so earth shattering and rather flat.By which time, I was so bored that I did not really care what they found anyway.2 stars. One for the nice pictures in the book and another for introducing me to the word/phenomena ""acrostic""."
3,don't believe the hype,I was expecting another good 'code' but it doesn't come close. good build up but then it gets lost
2,A little disappointed,"First off, let me say that I may suffer because of years of exposure to television and high-budget, low-intelligence movies, but this book just didn't capture me in any way. I wanted to like it, but couldn't. I found that it drifted more than my own short attention span and I had a very hard time connecting with any character.The curiosity to understand the nature of the Hyper... and the clues kept me going, but I was disappointed in how that thread just never fully materialized for me.All in all, I would not recommend it."
2,Not worth it,"I had high expectations for this book and was sorely disappointed. It's about writing a senior thesis, nothing more."
4,A Fun Read!,"I found this book delightful. It was beautifully written and quite thought provoking. Although it doesn't have the minute-by-minute adventures of The Da Vinci Code; it does have some suspenseful and fast-paced moments. I also think Rule of Four develops its characters more thoroughly than the Da Vinci Code. I really got into the book and couldn't put it down, not to mention the ending took me by surprise. I recommend this book to anyone who likes mysteries and/or suspense thrillers. If this is the authors' first book, I can't wait to see what they come up with next!"
1,Boring,"Boring! Unless you can pronounce Hypnerotomachia don't give this book another thought. I gave up after 135 pages; the story appeared to be going nowhere. The authors give a good excuse to stop on page 115 with the quote, ""There's no worse thief than a bad book."""
1,"LASCIATE OGNE SPERNZA, VOI CH'INTRATE - Dante","""There is no worse thief than a bad book"" pp 163 from the authors own mouth, although it is a well known Italian proverb. This is possibly the worst book I have ever read. There are too many inconsistencies for this to be a good book. The example on pp189 is purely a result f bad research and watching too much tv.The glue that holds the plot together is poorly written. The post puberty immature antics of some mediocre college students are boring if not down right irritating. I was amazed that the two author have attended and presumably done well at two of the America's premiere education institutions, I guess they must let anyone in these - a real shocker."
5,"A great read. Perfect mix of human emotion, life lessons and mystery.","This was a fantastic read. Being knee deep in my own college experience perhaps allowes me to appreciate the feelings and nostalgic emotions that these characters have for eachother more than most. This novel touches on a wide variety of human experiences from relationships to death. It seems like a lot of readers read this book expecting another Da Vinci Code, which it is not intended to be. This is not a white knuckle ride, while it does have plenty of suspense, it slows down at points and does so in a way that makes the read enjoyable in a different way than any Dan Brown novel can."
3,It was OK,"I have to agree with some of my fellow reviewers, were it not for the success of ""DaVinci Code,"" this book would've been passed over. It has some of the same appeal to it, medieval books and mysteries, etc. but none of the flowing appeal. I could tell that there were two authors---look at the first two paragraphs---they completely sound different. At times the writing is flowery, other times very descriptive. It gave me the case of the double takes. I was reading this book in sync with a friend who LOVED THIS BOOK...so I felt I had to keep reading it. It was a good story somehow; but it had some major flaws. You can see the flaws listed here by my fellow reviewers, which are sometimes better written than the book.If these two authors are so hyped up on their Ivy league background, I suggest their returning to school for advanced studies."
2,"Looking for the next ""DaVinci Code""? Keep looking.","I fell for the hype & I was very disappointed. It's more like ""The Secret History"", which I didn't much care for either."
3,Not for everyone,"This is quite a good book written by very young people for very young people. That is why you can find some pearls of wisdom there, such as ""on the first date never go to an unfamiliar place,"" that work pretty well for those that just started dating. If you are mature enough to vote for Republicans (or Democrats, in that special case, it does not matter), I am not sure it is worth reading as this is a book about love and obsession and the authors do not really know what love and obsession are.Though, I contradict myself as I have read it. So, rectifying the point, this book is for those who somehow are able to keep the spirit of a high school student."
2,Slow moving,"I'm giving this book two stars because I respect the subject matter it has tried to undertake, however, this book is quite a yawn. I had a difficult time getting into it. To be honest I bought it because it sounded something like the Da Vinci Code, and perhaps that's where my disappoint lies. This book is not as action packed and not as well researched and written. Still, I think the subject could have been interesting and if this author tried to write another I would also give that a shot."
2,"Sadly, a disappointment.","I share many of the same impressions as G. Makarski in her review of 10/22.The marketing of the book as a comparison to DaVinci pretty much guarantees you will be disappointed. This is unfortunate, as the book has interesting qualities of its own, but should not have been compared with a story of suspence. You'll note many of the reviews here come to the same conclusion; slow, unfocused, and awkwardly written at times, but with some rewarding moments all of which pertain to human relationships, especially between these young men. It seems to me that all of the ingredients were here for a really great book, but it should have been edited down to perhaps one/half its length, removing the clutter that subtracts rather than adds, especially in the latter third of the book."
2,"Not the Greatest, but Not the Worst","Like many other reviewers, I went into The Rule of Four expecting it to be similar to Dan Brown's work (which I LOVE!). The authors spent a great deal of time of developing the character's relationships with one another. At times, suspense would be building when they would delve in a character's past, which I didn't enjoy. I must admit I was confused at several points at some of the interpersonal issues they had with one another. I must have missed something earlier. When I finished, my first thought was ""That book was confusing."" It was good, but not great, and could have been better."
4,Great first timer novel,"Other reveiwers are correct-this book is no DaVinci Code. While the premises of the two books are similar, The Rule of Four is not the suspense/thriller that The DaVinci Code is. That said, however, I think the Rule of Four is a great book. I enjoyed learning about an ancient manuscript I had never heard of before, and I am always intrigued by hidden riddles, codes, etc. A few spots where I didn't care for the book are: Long narratives of memories that, while you read them, seem not to matter, but you get insight for later events. This is not a bad feature, but it took me a while to get used to it. The other minor flaw was how quickly and easily the books secrets were discovered. That seemed illogical to me. I also would have loved to know more about how the rule of four actually worked. It is alluded to as the answer, but we never really find out just how it helped solve the puzzle, or how the kids figured it out. In the end, though, I thoroughly recommend this book."
1,Not as good,"I was highly disappointed with this book. It was recommended to me as ""similar to the Da Vinci Code,"" and it was nothing like it at all! There was no around the world problem solving. There was no art history and religious symbolism. It was a crummy read about an ancient book that I still cannot pronnounce. I was extremely frustrated with this book."
1,dissapointed,If you expect another Davinci code...YOU WILL BE VERY VERY DISSAPOINTED.WRITING STYLE IS POOR AND WONDERS.THE STORY IS INTERESTING BUT CAN NOT BE RECOMMENDED
2,Not comparable to The Da Vinci Code,"I'm baffled by the number of reviews that compare this book to The Da Vinci Code. Unlike Dan Brown's bestseller, which propells the reader headlong at a breathtaking pace, and ladles out the exposition in bite-sized chunks of dialog, the Rule of the Four is plodding and ponderous. Almost nothing happens in the first fifty pages, except to introduce characters and wedge in page after page of backstory and Princeton travelogue. Don't be taken in by the comparisons to The Secret History (Donna Tartt), the Brotherhood of the Rose (Umberto Eco), and The Da Vinci Code, as this work is never as well written as the former, as exciting as the latter, or as scholarly as the one in the middle."
2,What's all the fuss about?,"After all the over-hyped reviews of this book, I was disappointed with the read, and felt I had wasted my time. The part of the book dealing with the puzzle of the Hypnerotomachia Poliphili was interesting, but underdeveloped, and lacked a conclusion. The romance was sophomoric. The murder mystery uninvolving, and also underdeveloped."
2,Not what I expected,"Having read the DaVinci Code, I was really anticipating this novel. However, three-quarters of the way through, I am asking when is it going to take off? The topic is indeed intriguing, and the book should not be boring, but for me it is. By the way, I happen to think Dan Brown is an excellent writer. I like Umberto Eco too."
2,Not at all like the Da Vinci Code,"I read this book under the auspice that it would be like the Da Vinci Code...boy was I wrong!!! This book, though it had its good moments, read very slowly. There was very little action and a tremendous amount of character development. I would not recommend this book to someone looking for another ""Dan Brown type author."""
1,"Please , somebody buy my copy","Trust me, I've read The DaVinci Code, and this is no DaVinci Code! The turgid meandering plot unfolds page after page, chapter after chapter, going nowhere slowly. Even the Princeton University setting and student life at the school is never fully realized . You could learn more by going to Princeton's home page. Serves me right for ignoring my own cardinal rule never to read a novel that has more than one author. Sigh."
3,"While I liked this book.,parts of it are awfully slow","While I liked this book,parts of it are awfully slow to go anywhere,and The Backgrounds and Personalities of the TitleCharacters should have been fleshed out some more..If someone wants to read it buy a used copy."
1,Please DONT compare to Dan Brown !!,"Having read all the Dan Brown's books which are gripping you from page 1 to the end, I was expecting a lot from this Rule Of Four. What a disappointment !!! Ok, Mr Caldwel has a knowledge of things for sure but this knowledge is the only thing you have all along the book !! This book is as thrilling as a fight of turtles !!!! I have rarely been so bored and did not even reached the end. Really too much of an effort there !! This has NOTHING to do with Dan Brown !! Please !!! If you like neverending blahblah go for it..... if you want a real suspense, go back to Dan Brown..... QUICK !!"
2,I have had better,"This novel gives me a mixed feeling. This writer wrote this book with scholarly words and applied exceptional metaphors in describing complicated thoughts and abstract concepts. In a way it gives me a feeling that the four Princeton undergraduates reflect the writer himself. Be that as it may, from a novel reader's perspective, the plot and development of this novel is a failure. The closer to the ending, the poor the story. And honestly, the finale is quite unacceptable, even illogical which is contrary to the nature of the quest described in this book. With all due respect, I recommand a rewrite of the novel (though impossible) for not wasting the research work."
2,The rule of four,"This is a bad book, stay away from it, if you like intrigue novels. It seems that the authors were paid by the number of pages the they wrote so they need to fill the book with all this princeton stuff and with a no very well described romance. The book fells short of any expectacions, even the title is not the punch line of the book.The book is filled with more things that are not related to the core of the story that you get the feeling that you don't know wich is the story that you are reading"
1,The Rule Of Four,"The first rule for the rule of 4 is to not buy this book. I was enticed by the notion that this might be a DaVinci Code equal. I was 100 pages into the book and was still not sure what all the nonsense was about. I guess the second rule is - beware of dual authors. I slipped this time, not again!"
1,No Hard Feelings,"Another novel I found extremely uninteresting and waste of time and money having it. Too much college stuffs, with too little historical stories in it, more like 95/5. Buying this book, I thought of reading some good historical plot in it, well, guess what? I am 200% wrong. Even after finishing college quite sometime ago, I found that plots twisting around the campus do not stir me college nostalgic memory a bit.My brother also happened to read this book and his score is same as mine: 1 star a.k.a. We hate it!"
1,Did you make enough money off of this book?,"Welll, I only paid four dollars at Costco, so I guess I shouldn't expect much. I did finish this book, but I wish I hadn't. This book was the most amateurishly written, cynical pot boiler that I have ever read. Don't waste your time. Don't enrich these authors any more."
2,a disappointment,"What a relief to read other reviews by people who weren't pleased with this book. After all the positive reviews, I thought I'd missed something because I was thoroughly disappointed.In general, I like the premise of the story - I like the history (an in that sense, it can be compared with Dan Brown books). However, that's where, for me, the comparison stops. Where as Dan Brown's books are engaging, Rule of Four did not pull me into the story. There was potential for suspense, however it was not engage me, therefore it was wasted. I love reading books in which I lose all sense of time and I feel as though I'm a silent witness walking experiencing the story, first-hand, with the characters. Unfortunately, this was not such a book."
2,Nothing to get excited about.,"This book is like the person who thinks they have it all -- looks, personality, charm, charisma. But, the realty is that they are unoriginal, boring and try too hard. When I finished The Rule of Four I thought nothing. I didn't hate it and I didn't love it. It was forgettable. The book starts off with the main character, Tom Sullivan, telling the reader about the Hyperotomachia, the mysterious book that is the center of the story. This would be great, but the authors fail to give the reader a reason to care. They seem to be so caught up in writing the story with it's complicated riddles and details of snobby ivy league students that they forget that a story is only compelling and passionate to the reading public if they can in some way identify or empathize with it. Therefore, I read the book always feeling like I was waiting for something to happen. Something with real emotion. Something truly intriguing. Something I could care about. Sadly I never got that."
2,What's Up?,"I just finished reading this book and, while I can't agree with either reviewer so far, I wonder what Steven Williams (I think that was his name) has against the book/authors or anybody else associated with it. It truly is not helpful to continue to post the same review again and again. Once would have been enough. We get your drift, already: you didn't like the book. I didn't either particularly. I found it to be fragmented and, actually, kind of silly. I think these two guys sat down one day and said to each other, ""Hey, if Dan Brown can do it, so can we."" Well, guess what: you didn't. Whatever you do, guys, don't give up your day jobs. There's got to be an easier way for you to get rich."
5,So what if the characters aren't Bruce Willis? Its Princeton.,"This is the Da Vinci Code (minus the anti-catholic agenda) for people who took freshman humanities and liked it. Yeah, the characters are dorky dorm kids, and that bothered me until I realized that's probably how Princeton kids are. If you need an unfailing hero try Clive Cussler. Josh Hamilton reads flat out superbly on the audio version, though I think the abridged version cuts some of the good literary references in favor of the goofy plot. Still, the ending will make anyone with brothers cry for a second. Also, the many analogies while forced are refreshingly original."
3,I would have liked it better if it werent compared to DaVinci Code,"What the reviewers didn't realize is that by comparing it to the DaVinci Code, they set it on a pedestal that it just does not have the ability reach. I wish I never opened the front cover and read the reviews. I would have liked it more.In the DaVinci code you are solving the riddles with the characters. In this book you are being told how they solved the riddles.Both books take place over a short period time, a day or two, however in The Rule of Four, it almost seems like it takes place over months."
2,"Like a boring movie, just want to read it thru","Hopeless book. Not sure how it became a bestseller. I bought it based on good reviews and it was compared to Dan Brown's work. I found it very dissapointing and not at all clinching.Its like a boring movie, that one sees anyways...just want it to finish as i cannot leave a book mid-way."
2,Not worth it for the ending.,"It was a little slow, but I was into it. The ending really disappointed me. I expected something greater!"
3,okay,"I thought the book was supposed to be a hardcover, but it was not. However, it did get here pretty quickly and I really do not mind is being a paperback"
1,yet_another_dont_buy_review,"I bought this book, primarily boz of comparisons in theme to DVC.well i dont intend to compare this book with DVC.. bcoz it wud be a disgrace to the dan brown masterpiece. so whats wrong with the book1. it talks very little about treasure hunt when the main theme is supposed to be around it..2. so what else is it about... thats the core problem.. it isnt about anything in particular.. it talks of princeton skool life.. then a dad-son ,guy-gal,4 friends' relationship.. without going into depth into any of it3. the plot; the author takes too damn long to reach the plot...almost 300 pages when the book itself is only 372 long4. the plot content: the plot is very confusing.. sometimes leading the user to lotsa confusing terms... dan brown presented similar stuff in a reader friendly matter5. at the end of the book, i dont think i willl carry anything abot it.. except for the fact that i lost money and time on it/"
2,Bored by this book,"It's very slow and not that great for this genre. I found the Davinci Code much more engaging. This book also goes back and forth in time, which some people like, but I don't. Altogether, dry, slow and boring."
1,Puerile Preppy Pap,The rule of four;1. Be wary of this publisher2. Don't believe the jacket review - this book is not even close to Dan Brown and not in the same league as Umberto Eco3. Don't buy any more books from these authors4. Do everyone a kindness and destroy every copy of this book you come across
2,Out of their Ivy League,"Compared to other academic thrillers likeRabid: A Novel,The Dante Club: A Novel, orSpecial Topics in Calamity Physics, The Rule of Four doesn't measure up.The Rule of Four is set at Princeton, very obviously at Princeton, at look-at-me-I'm-a-Princetonian Princeton. There's a part in this book where the authors (and the characters are obviously the authors,) sneer at someone who is too obsequious, too flashy, not Ivy League subtle enough, and yet that's exactly what they're doing throughout this whole book.Plotwise, the major turning points were oddly pulled out from under the major characters, much like a duel that happens off-stage and then someone staggers onto stage and tells you about it, and in a boring manner.It's a first novel, and these two writers are very young. Some of the passages have merit. It will be interesting to watch them mature as writers.Minna"
1,Pretty bad.,"If you want to read a pamphlet about Princeton and all it has to offer, especially for pretentious, semi-intellectual frat boys, then this book is for you. Otherwise do not waste your time, this operates under the guise of a mystery, when it's more comparable to ""Saved by the Bell, The College Years."""
1,review the reviewers,"I had trouble standing fifty pages. This book is so bad in its own way that my main reactions were sympathy for the authors and curiosity about the reviewers quoted on the jacket. Same ""New York Times"" that covered for Stalin and Castro, I guess. Shows the value of having Ivy friends in the publishing business. Should help the authors in some other work.Read Doyle's ""The Sign of Four"" for the umpteenth time and get more out of it."
2,An Insipid And Overly Done Narrative...NOT The Davinci Code!,"This book started out with promise, but quickly begand a spiraling descent into a mish mash of history lessons, bad writing, perspective on life, and cardboard cutout characters.The insight into Princeton, academia, and the Renaissance was interesting...but thats about it. The story was too involved, the 'quest' for knowledge not intriguing enough, and at the end it devolved into a shadow of a man, the main character, pontificating over his life, which meant absolutely nothing to me.Beyond a few history lessons, this book doesn't have much to offer. The Da Vinci Code at least swept you along in a fast pace of mystry and puzzles, but this one was more like slogging through an end of the year term paper. As opposed to hard to put down, it was hard to pick up.I'd recommend this one to readers who aren't too selective and who just need a book to kill time...if there's nothing else at the bookstore."
2,Deceptively bad,"Like many others, I was enticed by the promise of good writing compared to the Da Vinci Code. Like many others I was disappointed. As ham-fisted and obvious as Mr Brown's books are, at least they fulfill the fundamental requirement of the genre. They are page turners. They have a plot that screams along.Alas, The Rule Of Four is bogged down by its attempt to be deep and meaningful. The plot seems incidental. The characters are unpleasant, shallow and too exposed. Nowhere is the mystery made to seem important. Who cares about page upon page of Princeton lore and embarassingly written romance? Not I.The Rule of Four is one of the few books that I threw in the trash rather than pass on. I found the whole experience annoying, and I would rather not inflict it on my friends."
1,I left my paperback on a diving safari boat - no regrets...,"You can call it an unofficial guide to Princeton Univ., but do not call it a historical mystery book. At least a reader gets a deeper knowledge of Princeton's sewer system and local graduates rites than anything remotely historical. Those reviews comparing this book to D. Brown's work were quite generous in my view..."
1,Very Disappointed,"I bought this book based on the publisher's hype that it was another DaVinci Code. To steal a quote: ""I knew the DaVinci Code and this is no DaVinci Code"". Not even close. In fact, while I almost always finish a book I pick up, I couldn't make it more than 1/2 way through it. The plot is unclear, as is the writing. I would suggest, instead, any Michael Connelly or Harlan Coben book, or an early Baldacci. Also, I just started Shadow Divers (kind of written like a Krakauer book) which is non-fiction and a real page turner; a definite summer read."
1,The Hardy Boys meet The Da Vinci Code,"When they're not playing paintball in the sewers under Princeton, Frank, Joe, Chet and Biff solve the riddle of the Hypnoflippityfloppityfloo, unmasking Psycho History Professor as the villain. He would've gotten away with it if it hadn't been for those meddling kids!!!I cannot begin to describe just how rotten this book was. To call it a steaming pile would be an insult...to steaming piles. The writing stinks. The story stinks. The only thing compelling about the Rule of Four is that you'll be compelled to keep reading and keep reading - like a Bataan Deathmarch of Literature, thinking to yourself ""Surely it'll get better? Surely there's a point to all this?"" It never does. There never is. Oh, if only I'd followed my first instinct and drop-kicked it out the window!!You'd think two guys with Ivy League degrees would be capable of doing a little better? Not these two, apparently."
1,A pretentious attempt at depth,"I bought this book after reading numerous rave reviews. It is a terribly boring and misogynistic story that's so proud of itself it's nauseating. Other reviewers claim that only shallow, TV-obsessed readers will dislike this book. All I have to say is that I graduated first in my class at Berkeley, got a 1600 on my SATs, am Phi Beta Kappa and currently getting a PhD from MIT and I hated this book. Don't believe the hype."
2,"Don't buy it, don't read it","Having found this book abandoned in a hotel lobby, I thought it might be fast paced and interesting. Boy, was I wrong!This story wanderrs aimlessly without recognizable organization. My mistake was to read the first hundred pages hoping it would improve, as I was desperate for something to read - it didn't. Why it was published, I have no idea.After looking at the author's bios, I realized they were two kids fresh out of college with no life experiences. It shows.Don't buy this one!"
2,Interesting premise but a dull end-result,"I love the premise - 500 year old book filled with riddles and puzzles. But the lack of character development and over-dependence on descriptive day-to-day college life makes the end result dull. The authors, if they continue writing, will undoubtedly learn how to develop characters without resorting to simply describing the characters and the character's feelings. But as for this book, 80% of it is exactly that - a descriptive narrative of a group of college seniors and their daily actions and feelings. I don't feel as if I got to know or empathize with any of these characters despite learning eveything about them.As for the ancient book and it's mysteries - interesting at times, but there were too few of these moments.All in all, a forgettable read."
2,Doesn't live up to recent hype,"I haven't been this disappointed by a book since I read ""The Lovely Bones"". High points: the research the authors have done seems to be solid. I was interested in the story behind the ""Hypnerotomachia Poliphili"". That's where the praise ends.Low points: Character development was way below average. I can't think of any one character I gave a darn about. And, I couldn't give a hoot about Princeton life.I can't figure out how anyone can compare it to ""The Da Vinci Code"". Brown's book had it's problems but at least it was entertaining.In my opinion, the publishers saw an opportunity to ride on the coat tails of the success of ""The Da Vinci Code"". It's almost like they said, ""Hey! Lets' print this quick so people will snap it up while Brown's book is fresh in their memories. Who needs a good story?""."
2,Another NY Times Hype Job,"Whenever I read a rave review in the NY Times, the first thing I say to myself is that there's a 50-50 chance this book will live up to the hype. Lord, was this boring and pretentious. Another tedious attempt at ""I am smarter than thou."" More and more, I am scanning the Amazon.com reviews to hear what real readers think. I found two readers who were touting Robert Harris' Pompeii and 1906, an epic based on the great San Francisco earthquake by James Dalessandro. The previous is wonderful, the latter is the most thrilling, page turning read I have found all year. Let me jump on the band wagon of people who love powerful, colorful, complex historical fiction and say Pompeii and 1906, particularly the latter, are the year's best books. Could not put them down. If you must, borrow this book from a friend and judge for yourself. Then give 1906 and Pompeii a read."
2,Marketeers and reviewers fooled us!,"This is not a bad book - in fact, the writing is more mature than the sophomoric Da Vinci Code.These 2 just-out-of-school guys, although obviously much smarter, talented,and grounded than many their age or older, produced a book that has no defining genre but meanders this way and that way with a little cryptography on the side to justify the claim to being thriller or whatever.I began to read with great interest willing to follow the authors whenever they took me for reasons I assumed would become clear later - 1/3 into the book we were still prancing about with the vigor of a new born lamb; now into 1/2 the book I have lost the will to read more.They have talent, next time perhaps they will think more deeply about what the book is about (not a showcase for all they learned at school) and work with a worthy editor."
1,Highly overrated,"Although I admit that the book finally 'picks up' some momentum after the initial 200 page slog, it never really becomes a compelling read. I did, in fact, finish this book, but only because it's difficult for me to abandon any book I've started. There is absolutely no basis for comparison between ""The Rule of Four"" and any Dan Brown work beyond the tenuous thread that some historical puzzles are being solved within the pages. The fact that the plot line of ""The Rule of Four"" is anchored in an actual historical text does nothing to lift it from its plodding pace. My copy will be donated."
1,Boring,"How dare anyone say this book is better than Da Vinci Code...it is not even close..I was fooled by the reviews on the book..bought it ...read it..and still regretting it..and whats with the word ""nodded""..they use it like a zillion time...Mostly the book is about Princeton...if i were interested in that..i would have got a Brochure...Seriously...either the authour knew a couple of critics who gave them good reviews and that influenced other critics...OR..the critics were talking about a totally different book then the ""Rule of Four""..."
2,These authors are in their early twenties and it shows.,"Turn on MTV for the same one-dimensional Ryan Seacrest-like characters. The 'Hypnerotomachia Poliphili' is such a bold topic and I am thankful the authors educated me on the mysterious book, but they also created four of the most unlikable characters on record. I was hoping the protagonists would fade into the background and the book would take center-stage... not a chance. Those whiney brats kept blabbing on about social issues and romances that twelve-year-olds have. These writers are gifted historians (and now they're rich), but they've spent most of their lives in libraries. They need to get out of quad if they're going to actually write about people."
2,Thank You Mass Market,"This book is the product of a hot new market place (thanks in part to Dan Brown) and the idea that Ivy League writers are automatically brilliant. The truth of the matter is this book is thin, weak, tasteless. It is watered down coffee relying upon cream and sugar fundaments to spice up an otherwise crumbling effort. Do yourself a favor and pick up Human Interface here at Amazon by Jason Giacchino and leave the scholars to their studies. Who knows, perhaps after Ian Caldwell graduates from Intro to Creative Writing, he'll release a more impressive second effort."
2,Why is this book so popular???,I might have liked this book better had it not been compared to the Da Vinci Code. Now THAT was a great book! The great mystery in this book has lasted 500 years - yet its unraveled pretty easily by random people popping in the main characters dorm room. I found the main character rather unlikable. He is this kind of geeky self absorbed character - and yet is doted on by his girlfriend who stepped off the screen of Dawson's Creek (and is even named Katie) and by his glamour room mates. I don't get it. The two main characters are pretty well drawn out - but the girlfriend and room mates are fantasy caricatures. There were also some editing problems. All in all - pretty mediocre with a few clever moments thrown in. I want to get rid of my copy but I certainly won't give it to any of my friends to read!
1,Worst ever,"I had just read the Da Vinci Code and was looking for something more taxing, but in the same vein, so I bought this one - based on the reviews. What a waste of time and money!!This has to be the worst book I have ever read. The story lumbers ponderously onwards, littered with obscure references to US University life which mean nothing to foreign readers. There is no ""grip"" at all. I usually read a book like this in a day or two - this took me three weeks!!! It is simply ""unpickupable""."
2,A bit juvenile for its setting,"I suppose I fall into the category of folks who didn't get the point of this novel. Aside from learning a good deal about Princton History, this book was a trite little love story that was schmaltzed up to entice a greater audience.Did it even end?"
2,Gee Wiz-Kid Writing,"Although I admire their intellect and attention to academic detail, this is not a great book. It is at turns both precious and precocious. They are trying to be too ""writerly"" - the effect is like miking the floor beneath an amateur ballet - you hear all of the steps rendered clumsily and obviously. The characters do not come to life except as stiff cardboard preppies, and after all that trying. At least Brown doesn't even try to depict real people. I tried to be sympathetic, but in the end, I hated this book and had a great deal of trouble trying to finish it before owing my tax refund to the library."
1,Boring,"A boring, predictable waste of time. Several times I thought the book might take off and it got stuck time after time. A bunch of times I felt myself asking, ""Who cares?"" I felt like it was a detention assignment. I was relieved when I was done reading it."
1,The Rule of BORE,"This novel made me carsick, with all its needless jerking and twisting, poorly timed leaps and ""surprises."" And worst of all, at the end of this long grueling ride, you find you haven't arrived anywhere worthwhile after all. Uggh. If you're into sophomoric college social scenes, puerile musings, two-dimensional characters, shameless name-dropping, and vapid plots-- or if you want to know if that one guy REALLY DID GO TO PRINCETON-- read this book. Otherwise, you'd probably have more fun pulling out your teeth with rusty pliers.The only thing worse than reading The Rule of Four was having to see the two self-important bombastic pseudointellectual ""authors"" on the dust jacket. ""Hey, did we mention we're Ivy Leaguers?!"""
3,"A boring read, but well researched","I really had to struggle to make it through this book. It has been likened to ""The DaVinci Code"" put they are nothing alike. This book gets so entangled with the academics and theories of a wide range of subjects, that the plot is often forgotten. I kept asking myself - when will it get better and what's the point? I gave it 3 starts just because of the enormous effort the author put into it, but it's dull."
2,The Rule of Four,"An average first attempt by two recent college graduates. I found one error troubling that the authors should have found in their re-write phase: first, the authors tell us that Paul spent his freshman summer in Italy studying art with a professor and in a later chapter tell us that Paul spent that same freshman summer working the loading docks somewhere near Princeton's campus. Where exactly was Paul that summer? While these two highly eduacated authors tried to impress us with their knowledge of books I was not impressed by such a careless error in editing."
2,Not to be confused with Da Vinci Code or Name of the Rose,"I bought this book because it was compared to works by Umberto Eco and Dan Brown. Having read those authors with delight, I looked forward to a tight, gripping story.This book has nothing in common with work by those authors!!!The plot line is very imaginative, but the charqacters are not engaging and are developed too late in the story line.I found the story to be very choppy.Overall this book was paced too slow at the outset and easily loses the reader's attention. Though I did finish the book, it would have been easy to set aside had I not been determined to finish."
1,Prolonged,"I read this book because it was compared to the DaVinci Code. Sorry, very far from it. They are alike only because both are about hidden codes in old books--that's as far as the comparison can be made. From the beginning I found it just rambled on with pointless dialogue. Character development was sketchy and at times confusing. Although, it was branded as a mystery novel, The Rule of Four read more like a tour of the grounds and traditions of Princeton. I just finished reading it because I paid for it and hoped it would get better... which it didn't."
1,Don't bother,"I was excited to read this book as I has heard that it was a ""smarter"" Da Vinci code. I am sorry to say that I was pretty dissapointed. The characters didn't feel very real to me, they all seemed to be exceedingly uptight and the relationships amongst them didn't feel genuine. I can appreciate and respect that these guys had lofty academic pursuits that extended beyond nightly keggers and stupid pranks, but I was left with an impression of Princeton as a boring military state for the priveleged.It is interesting to learn about the Hypnerotomachia, but not enough to merit reading this book."
2,Extremely disappointed,"I put this book on my wish list and received it for my birthday. Usually I finish a book this size in a few days. It took me at least 3 weeks to get through this one. I got halfway through the book and I could not tell some characters apart from the others (especially Gil and Charlie). The endless Princeton descriptions made me skip whole paragraphs at a time, as I was mainly interested in the Hypnerotomachia plot. It should not be compared with The Da Vinci Code, as it centers more on the relationships of 4 friends, but because of reviews I was expecting a ""smart"" thriller and it sorely disappoints in that respect. If you're into college life and angsty youths, you may like it a little better. I just expected something more than that. 2 stars just because of the interesting Rennaissance bits strewn through the book."
2,Two Authors = Twice The Disappointment,"This is the sort of read you feel compelled to finish in the hope that it gets better - it does not. I feel I know more about the layout of North American campuses after reading this but nothing about the key players or the underlying quest.The authors, who have been friends since 8 would be better off sharing the occasional beer and leave it at that."
2,Dan Brown still Rules,"Huge disappointment! I bought the book after reading reviews that it was as good as, if not better than, the Da Vinci Code. This story lacks the thrilling page-turning suspense that Dan Brown achieves in the Code. The authors spend too much time with descriptive fillers rather than sticking to the meat and bones of the mystery. I would have rather read more historical background of the'hypnerotomachia poliphili' than of Princeton's traditions."
2,Don't waste your time or your money,"With all of the hype surrounding this book, I thought it was going to be great, unfortunately it was far from that. It was so slow and too pretentiously intellectual. Nothing in this book caught my attention and it was painful to finish. I don't know why people keep comparing this to The Da Vinci Code. It doesn't even compare. Save your money and rent it from the Library or If you want a great book, get The Da Vinci Code."
1,How did this end up on the bestseller list??????,"I think I know--I'm sure the authors are fine young gentlemen--with excellent Ivy League educations. I also suspect that they have either relatives or family friends in the publishing industry. They must because this book is AWFUL. Silly, meaningless story line, confusing and poorly written timelines, really and truly horrible. I can't imagine that anyone would care what happens to any of the totally unlikable characters, and I only kept reading to assure myself I was not giving them every chance to improve. Please believe me that anyone who has written a positive review of this book is a relative or a friend. Hopefully we have heard the last of these two in the world of fiction--by now they should have moved on to investment banking or law school. Please."
4,You people are nuts.,"I don't see how anyone can possibly compare the writing in this book to the DaVinci Code. While the DaVinci code is a great story, the writing is very Grisham-like and reads like 10th grade level novel. Come on.The Rule of Four is extremely well written compare to 'Code', and the story is good to boot.Go back to Grisham folks."
1,Don't waste your time,I never put down a book because it is so bad but this book takes the cake. It was absolutely horrible. I am sorry but when I was in college I was having the time of my life and not completely infatuated with an ancient book. Anyone for a game of laser tag??
3,Not that bad!,"It is interesting to see how many bad reader's reviews this book got at Amazon. At the end of the day, it is not a bad book at all. In fact, it is an interesting plot, in the venue of ""The Da Vinci Code"" and other secret-society-hidden-misteries kind of story that vaguely relates to religion that is so popular these days. To be honest, the story is a little bit more sophisticated than the usual Dan Brown's book, which is good, and the settings at Princeton are interesting either. Some characters sound a little artificial (and too ""evil""), but what the heck, this is pure phantasy! And of course, it is very nice to get to know Hypnerotomachia Poliphili!"
2,Slow Parts Hamper the Storyline,"As other people have mentioned, it had a similar premise as Da Vinci Code. Plus it was on the best seller list. So why would one not want to read it?Unlike Da Vinci Code, there is fairly little action. Only about 25% of the book is devoted to moving the story along. The rest seems to be lots of retrospective look at personal interactions among the main characters and their collegues and family. So it is really a book about relationships than historic mystery.There is nothing wrong with that execept that is not how the book was billed. So I found myself skipping pages at a time to get on with the story. By about 1/2 way through the book I had to finally give up. Maybe it got better, but the slow parts really detract from what could have been a good story."
4,Much much better than Da Vinci code,"The authors have said that they worked on this book well before the Da Vinci Code came out. I believe it; the book is a much heftier novel and much more interesting than the overhyped Da Vinci Code. This is literature. The Da Vinci code is pulp fiction.I bought this book and wound up having no interest to start it until a month or so after my purchase. Oh, but when I did! What a novel! The story is almost perfect. Although compared to The Da Vinci code, it's a hundred times better. . . both the story and the writing.The only flaw I had with the book was the villain. I found him to be a bit flat and lacking the dimensional qualities the other characters shared. Still, the breadth and depth of plot outweighed this minor issue."
1,"Good God, It's Dull!","Ugh, good God, this book is dull. My only thought while reading this book was, ""Get to your point already!"" The characters are cliches, shells of college stereotypes, and it takes much too long to get to the advertised storyline. I really do feel that this is a rip-off of Dan Brown's work, that the publisher is hoping readers will buy anything Renaissance, anything thriller, and anything with encrypted clues. This book, however, is just everything dull."
1,Don't believe all the hype,"I read the Davinci code and loved it. THe way they hyped this book I was ready for a long night's read. I tried to tough out the first 50 pages. Not only was it going no where, it was jumping around all over the place. THe narrator was rambling but never getting near the point. I kept hoping but finally through in the towel. Who ever praised this book must have read something else. All that stuff about the goings on at Princeton, never figured out what that had to do with things, though I will admit I gave up"
2,Freshman Effort,"For as much as I wanted this novel to be a good read, my expectations were not met. The story was promoted to have suspense and intrigue which it terribly lacked. The pedantic musings and invesitagations by the protagonists come across as showmanhip rather than legitimate and academic. Finally, the attempt to work Princeton college life, frienship, and the choice between girlfriend or ancient text is quite possibly the weakest and most underdeveloped portion of the novel. For its immaturity, posturing and lack of cohesiveness, you might consider reading something else."
2,Had to put it down,"After reading The Da Vinci Code I looked for books that might be similar. Amazon reviewers seemed to guide me to this book. After reading the first 100 pages I didn't know what was going on. I didn't know why I was reading this book. After each chapter I felt no urge to press on.I do not know why there are any comparisions to Dan Browns work. I would hesitate to not reccomend this book because I didn't finish it...and don't plan on finishing it. I dropped this book and picked up Angels and Deamons by Dan Brown instead and was happy I did so.I also gave this book to two other people who really enjoyed the Da Vinci Code and they too put the book down after about 80 pages.I don't mean to bash a book, but nothing made me want to read on. Not even skipping ahead and trying to find something interesting.Hope this helps."
2,"Disappointing, anticlimatic, no ending","There are a couple of riddles in this book that build a climax, however the end (or the lack thereof) if anticlimatic. This book is disappointing. The good point, though, is that it takes place at Princeton, and depicts some aspects of life there."
2,Half way through and waiting for some excitement,"When I read the FRONT PAGE article in the New York Times touting The Rule of Four to be the next runaway hit of the DaVinci Code genre, I ran to buy it! However, as has been previously and frequently critiqued, this book is not even close. I'm not saying anything about the literary style, character development or intellectual (pseudo) prose of these Ivy League authors, I'm simply saying it's not what it was pumped up to be!!! So far, half way through and I'm still trying to get my adrenalin pumping the way all of Dan Brown's books did. I read one review that stated the writer couldn't sleep after finishing the book because of the thrill quotient, but come on, do I have to get through this entire book--touring all of Princeton-- for a payoff? I think it's just a wanabe wolf in sheep's clothing."
2,Not a thriller,"I was expecting the type of action and suspense that was in Angels and Demons and other books in the genre. This book does not have that. It is more a book about Princeton and how students graduating from college must face the real world. If thst is what you are looking for, great. But if you are looking for drama, suspense, action, and adventure, look elsewhere."
2,Made it to page 83 before giving up.,I hadn't heard of this book before finding it at the library but it looked interesting so I thought I'd give it a try. The first twenty pages or so kept my interest but I kept waiting for something - anything - to happen. Finally gave up about sixty pages later.
2,Why?,This one is definitely for fans of the concept only. I slogged through the first 50% until I couldn't take any more. I didn't care about the characters nor the mystery.
2,Fails to satisfy,"This was a book that I couldn't wait to end. It has an interesting premise, but it was needlessly didactic and supercilious in its style."
2,what?,"This book is advertised like it's going to be some exciting thriller, and I was hoping for something better than The Da Vinci Code, like all the reviewers were promising. Well, read the fine print on the cover. Notice that one, little line somewhere hidden in the back flap that says ""coming of age story?"" Well, that's pretty much the whole book. I thought this would be a good look at the Hypnerotomachia, written in a thriller style, but what I got was something more like a whiny retrospect of the life and times of some college kid"
1,Rule of disappointment,"Check out this book from the library if you really have to read it. I regret having bought it based on the recommendation of a clerk at Barnes and Noble (saying it was like the DaVinci code but different). The book is more about how intelligent the authors are and a guide to Princeton than it is about the Hypnerotomachia Poliphilli.This book could have been so much better given the pre-text. I had really wanted to learn more about the subject but became drowned in pointless paragraphs and action text that came out of nowhere. It bored me to the point that I just finished the book without caring anymore about what the riddles eventually meant.Even the second story of the personal lives of the students was boring. To add, the college students didn't act, speak or behave like normal college students (but I didn't go to Princeton nor did I major in English literature).Perhaps being intelligent isn't directly correlated to telling a story well."
3,Is it worth your time? Yes. Is it worth your money? No.,"I honestly thought it was an interesting book. I don't agree that these 2 greenhorns don't know how to write a decent book because it was ""decent"". In my opinion the book started off as a page turner but halfway through, you still feel like you don't know the characters due to a lack of character development. Most of the times I didn't even like the main characters at all. However, the story behind the Hypnerotomachia is mind blowing and the riddles that come with it.Anyways, if you like history and puzzles, go ahead and borrow it from someone. If you plan on buying this book, don't even think about it if you're expecting ""Da Vinci Code"" or ""Dan Brown"".Ian & Dustin, y'all did ok but get a new publisher because he fu*ked it up for you guys by saying ""One part Da Vinci Code, one part The Name of the Rose"". You and I both know, that ain't the case. Hope to see another book!!!"
3,Nice Try,"Like the others have said, this is not a Da Vinci Code, like it refers to on the jacket, probably just a marketing ploy. The authors have a good idea and then forget about it, prefering to go on and on about college life and Tom's basic life confusion. I tried to finish it, really I did!, I made it through about 3/4th of it, but finally I gave up, and, committing the most horrible act of all, read the last 20 or so pages, hoping to renew my interest. Ah...didn't work."
4,Patience is a virtue!,"It took me two weeks to read the first 1/2, but one evening for the second. I did find the main characters a bit sad and a little too ""old"" before their time, however after finishing the book I started to reminisce about old times and felt a little disappointed that it had finished. In summary it was a good book but I guarantee most people that persist with it, will be a little disappointed, tailors for specific personalities."
2,A disappointment,"I read this book by audio tape. It was okay, but a disappointment. The plot never really went anywhere. The book sounded like a college paper."
2,A very unevenly paced read,"Like many others, I purchased this book in hopes of replicating the excitement generated by reading 'The DaVinci Code'. However, put thoughts of that book out of your head when reading 'The Rule of Four'. There really isn't that much in common between the two.I simply had trouble getting into this book. The descriptions of life at Princeton were dull, the plot took far too long to get up to speed, and by the time it did, I just wanted the book to be done so that I could move on to something else. The two authors do show a lot of promise and probably just need some time to develop in order to turn out better characters and pacing.I can't recommend this book personally, but looking back at other reviews, it seems that some people have greatly enjoyed it. Maybe I just didn't have the patience for it."
1,pretentious and boring,"I had great expectations for this book after reading a brief synopsis of it -- I would have been happy to stop reading right then and there. There is very little suspense built up over the course of the entire book, and there are senseless plot twists that keep the reader wondering ""why did that have to happen?"" (and why am I reading this?). Secondly, there are too many characters introduced for the authors to be able to deal with them on a less superficial level. Thirdly, the characters go off on way too many philosophical ramblings at inappropriate times in the book--people just don't talk that way (citing Greek philosophers in casual conversation)--even pretentious Princeon undergrads don't interact with each other that way. If they do, then I'm sorry that I wasted my time by painfully reading through this book. Don't be fooled by the inside cover's plot summary. You'll be disappointed."
2,This is no Da Vinci Code,"After hearing all the hype for this book, I was so excited to read it. However, the book moves at an extremely slow pace. The story around the Hypnerotomachia Poliphili was very fascinating, but the rest of the book was blah. I didn't particularly enjoy any of the characters or the various subplots. I wish the book was more focused on the Hypnerotomachia Poliphili, rather one of the author's experience at Princeton. Again, you if you looking for a Da Vinci Code like book, this is not it. Just read Angels and Demons or Digital Fortress by Dan Brown"
1,There's no worst thief than a bad book,"That quote is found in this book and couldn't be more apt. The quote is the only good thing I got from reading this story. And when I say ""read"" I mean I skipped many pages and came close to just quitting the whole thing, but decided for some unknown reason to keep slogging on to the end. This book stole my time. Time I could have spent doing something much more interesting, like reading Garfield or taking out the garbage. Actions I would recommend instead of reading The Rule of Four."
3,entertaining for part of a flight,"The common comparisons to The Da Vinci Code are apt only in that this is a mystery story regarding codes and a real-life document (in this case, Hypnerotomachia Poliphili; in the case of Dan Brown's book it's hoaxed documents about the Priory of Sion which were fabricated by Pierre Plantard and planted in the Biblioteque Nationale). This book is a somewhat better novel with more substantial characters, but it's not a great book. I bought it at an airport and read it during an international flight, and found myself with many extra hours to spare. I don't think it's worth buying in hardback--and unfortunately the British trade paperback edition I bought cost as much as Amazon sells the hardback for."
2,Ruled Out,"For readers of historical suspense fiction, Rule of Four promises Renaissance intrigue clothed in a contemporary Ivy League setting. As is often the case with this present-past interweaving of narrative, the past overshadows the present. The story holds up well until the halfway point, drawing you into a struggle between the art and religion of 15th Century Italy. Then the contemporary drama of 20-ish college students becomes the central focus and the novel drags itself to a predictable conclusion. Not bad for 20-something authors, but a half a book is still a half a book."
2,Ho-hum... Not worth the talk that it received,"The first problem with the books is that it takes 157 pages of reading before it really goes anywhere. Some may argue that it was ""character development"", but after discussing it with several serious English Lit types we all agreed it was a lot of wasted paper. I feel that the authors had a great time at Princeton and that the eating clubs was the highlight of their time there (pity). I kept hearing how this was going to be the next Da Vinci Code - same genre people, so we can compare - but it was anything but. I think the authors need some more practice. I do not recommend this book to anyone."
2,Whether compared to DVC or not - DON'T BOTHER !,"What the heck - I read it all the way through. Sure enough, it was a disappointment, and not worth the time. (Gee, maybe I should have scanned some Amazon.com reviews first and looked at the overall rating...) Whether you ""compare"" it to The DaVinci Code or not, it really doesn't even stand up well on it's own. The plot's implausible, you never really connect with any of the characters enough to care about them, and, unless you're a rather immature high school or college boy, it's basically pretty silly. How did it achieve ""Best Seller"" status? Hype, I guess. Sure glad I got it from my library and saved some $. (Sorry Amazon.)"
2,"Much promise, little delivery","While true that the structure and style of writing was disappointing, immatureand at cross-purposes, one good thing to be said about The Rule of Four was its bringing to light some of the intriguing mysteries of the Hypnerotomacchia Poliphili.The authors constructed the ending for a sequel that would involve further encounters with this fascinating subject, but unless there are significanteditorial interventions and radical improvements in the content & caliber of thewriting, it could prove to be another exercise in frustration for the serious reader.What an exciting read if an author of substance and skill were to take on this arcane and suggestive antiquity!"
2,"Interesting idea, poorly written","I bought this book because I thought the premise sounded interesting. I was right; it was an interesting premise and the substance of the 15th century ""mystery"" was interesting to me. Having said that, these authors make me appreciate the skill of professional writers, even professional hacks. I would skip it if I were you. This will NOT be the next Da Vinci Code -- it's just not good enough."
2,Inteligente.... pero aburridisimo!,"Me encanta la novela historica y por eso compre este libro. Aprendi sobre el ""Hypnerotomachia Poliphili"", sobre el cual nunca habia escuchado nada, y punto. La historia es muy aburrida, va muy lento. La unica razon por la que lo termine fue porque no me gusta dejar libros sin terminar, pero no valio la pena. No lo compren!! Si quieren leer novelas historicas geniales compren ""El Ultimo Caton"" o ""Los Pilares de la Tierra""."
2,"""Da Vinci Code"" Is More Fun","Overall, I was disappointed by this book. I hadn't really read anything about it prior to seeing it on display at the book store. Of course, I did know of the comparisons between it and ""The Da Vinci Code,"" but after finishing Rule, I understand why Dan Brown's book has been on the bestseller list since its release and why this one has not. ""The Rule of Four"" is just no fun. I kept hoping that the suspense would pick up, but it never did.Even aside from ""The Da Vinci Code,"" Rule lacks. The characters all speak like 40 year old professors. I get that they're smart, they attend an Ivy league school, but I found it a big turn-off. They're my age, yet I wouldn't want to be friends with any of them. And I'm supposed to care about them and this mystery.Ultimately, The Hypernowhosywhatsit is interesting, in itself. The fictional story that has been crafted around it is what I didn't like."
2,Just alright,"Don't expect a fast moving, action packed plot. This is more of a coming-of-age story than a mystery.I found some bits annoying or unbelievable. The mystery around the Hypnosomething book isn't introduced until well into the story. The jumps in chronology are confusing. And a pair of undergrads solve a mystery that lasted hundreds of years?Overall, this is a good first-time effort for the authors. Nelson DeMille says on the back cover that 'if Scott Fitzgerald, Umberto Eco, and Dan Brown teamed up to write a novel, the result would be' this book. Hmmmmm, no."
3,A little disappointed,"I was expecting something else from this book. I though it was going to be more of a mystery. I wanted to know more of what happened and I wanted to have it presented to me in a less ""dry"" form. The history interwined with the present in a little awkward way. I did enjoy it but I just think the book should have been advertised in a different way. It was completely misleading."
3,Da Vinci Light--,"I read this book as a follow up to the Da Vinci Code because I had heard somewhere it was a tighter, more sophisticated thriller than that blockbuster. It's not.The basic plot is interesting in concept, but it gets bogged down in a haphazard love affair. And while the authors make an effort to involve the reader in the protaganists' step-by-step solution to the mystery, they fail. The answers seem too gimicky and are inaduately explained to convince us they could have remainded hidden from inquisitive scholars for 500 years.The authors do a better job painting a lively picture of college life at Princeton. I was thoroughly envious of the students there by the time I was half-way through the book."
1,"Windy, tangled, and BORING.","I don't know who compared this book to the DaVinci Code, but they were WAY off. This book purports to be about a code hidden in some obscure ancient book, but its actually about a bunch of pretentious, self-absorbed Princeton students, written by pretentious, self-absorbed Princeton students. If you care about Dod Hall and the Ivy Club, then by all means, read this book. If however, like 99.9% of the population, you don't care about arcane Princeton trivia, skip it. If you prefer your characters undeveloped with minimal plot, this is the book for you. If however, you would rather read a book that's actually ABOUT something or has some characters that connect with the reader, then you will be far better served by almost any other book in the English language, even ""The DaVinci Code"", not exactly a literary masterpiece itself.Seriously, this book sucks."
1,What a letdown,"After a promising first quarter, this story simply fell apart. I must say, however, that this book was well promoted. Hopefully the publishers made their $ quickly, before word of mouth killed the sales."
1,A big waste of time,"One of the comments on this book that is printed on the back cover goes like ""The Da Vinci code for people with brains"". This book is anything but. About 10% of the book is centered about a mystery code hidden in some ancient novel. The remaining 90% of the book is an endless, meandering rambling about the life and life history of four students in Princeton. Unlike the Da Vinci code, you don't get to see any puzzle at all; at various points, parts of the code are revealed and the final climax is underwhelming. Don't waste your time with this book."
1,just awful,"This book really is just dreadful. I thought that the Da Vinci Code was a terrible book until I read this and realised that Dan Brown at least has a sense of pace. Badly written, boring story - the publishers should be ashamed to have mentioned The Secret History in comparision to this book."
4,"Unspellable, but very good","So this is a book about a book, in which students run around in under ground tunnels, while the book they are researching also contains under ground tunnels. There is a lot of this kind of symbolic parallelism between the story of the friends @ Princeton and the mysterious book they are trying to crack. I'm not sure I even got all the levels of parallels. Nevertheless, this was definitely worth my time. I'm tired of books that waste my time with lame prose and half baked ideas. Give me something to chew on! And this one did that. Thanks, Caldwell and Thomson, for some truth in advertising..."
2,Dont Waste Your Time- No Really,"I was so excited when I first began reading this book. It's been a year since the DaVinci Code and I was looking forward to a good mystery with some puzzles mixed with theology. Boy was I dissapointed. There was about 1/3rd or less mystery and excitement, mostly friendship with others on the campus of Princeton. At times wonderfully written, but mostly contrived, confusing, and dull. Even the secret, when finally revealed, was anticlimactic. I felt like saying ""So WHAT????"" This was like a good movie concept turned into a ""B"" movie because of bad direction and low budget. Sad. It could have been great had the two authors not spent so much time on thier college relationships."
3,The Rule of Four,"For those looking for fast paced action, just skip this one. Slow moving with a lot of digression about irrelevant Princeton activities which are not even real for the most part, this book is rather disappointing. Except for the riddles, the plot is very predictable. The dust jacket promises intellectual stimulation which is sadly lacking. All in all a wonderful premise shot to hell!"
3,A Very Well Marketed Book,"I believe it was Nelson DeMille who sold me this book with a glowing flap review. It has been compared to both ""The Secret History"" and ""Da Vinci Code"", but falls short of both.My biggest gripe about the book is character development. The one likeable character has an insignificant role in the story while the protagonist has a horrible and shifting sense of personal priorities. I would guess that the authors meant for him to be quirky and likeable.Not to beat up on DeMille, but I can see why he likes the book so much - he also positions unlikable characters as somewhat heroic.One of my three stars is for their very interesting story of the Florentine Bonfire of the Vanities,"
1,Most boring book I've read in years,"I just can't understand how this book could get such good reviews. Comparisons with The Name of Rose are outrageous for a great author such Umberto Eco is. The Da Vinci Code keeps you stuck to the book, the Rule of Four bores you to death with details about college life that are neither relevant to the story nor interesting to anyone who has not been at Princeton. The two young authors have way to go to raise interest in the European public (I invite you to look at the UK reviews). Is there perhaps a riddle in the book that unveil the true story I haven't found and other reviewers here have?"
1,possibly the worst book I have ever read,"being a halfway well read person and familiar with the Hypnerotomachia, a friend or should I say fiend suggested I read the rule of four. This book is confusing and poorly written. The Hypnerotomachia it's self is a difficult read, but none the less very interesting. perhaps this author believes he is being clever by paralleling his story in an equally confusing manner. the time line of the book is near impossible to keep strait. I have little faith the book is worth investigating for a cipher of it's own. This is a serious disappointment and a waste on my kindle."
3,Da Vinci Code (College Version),"Comparison with Da Vinci Code:1. Da Vinci was not a first novel, Rule of Four was.2. The characters in Rule of Four have much more depth than those in Da Vinci Code. Do any of you feel that in some sense, the hero and heroine in Da Vinci are like those in James Bond movies? There are a lot more to the psychological struggle to the characters in ROF and all these description lent them shape and life. But it depends on whether you are more of an adventure lover or a sentimental reader.3. The ending of ROF drags on way too long than necessary.4. The book and the artefacts mentioned in the ROF are not as well known as in DVC, hence it is harder for the reader to understand and let alone have resonance on the topic.All in all it was an enjoyable read. =]"
2,Mixing these genres just doesn't work....,"I find myself a little confused on how to write a review for this book. While the read was easy and I found myself looking forward to picking up where I left off, I see now that I was searching for the content this story needed but never developed. Perhaps it was authors stab at trying to write an original Fitzgeraldesque novel and spicing it up with some mystery that would appeal to a broader audience. The only problem is, without writing a thousand page novel, there is no way to get the Fitzgerald type character development they are looking for and still have a solid story unfold, leaving a pretty hollow book with the reader really desiring a lot more. Don't get me wrong, there are glimpses of good writing, perhaps with time the author/s will develop better story telling abilities.Needless to say, I'm surprised at the popularity of this book."
4,Rose Meets Peace,"The Rule of Four reads something like The Name of the Rose meets A Separate Peace, centering on issues of ambition, loyalty, and friendship set within a murder mystery tied to the riddle of an obscure early Renaissance text. If that sounds complicated, well, it is. The novel is literary, complex, and intelligent, and not at all in the nature of the Da Vinci Code. For all its complexity, however, it holds well together. I enjoyed reading it and I recommend it highly. Just don't pick it up expecting car chases, gun fights, and albino-monk-assassins. It's not that kind of book."
2,I was suckered,"I admit I fell for all the hoopla. I saw the book on the best seller list and saw the comparisons to The Da Vinci Code. One page into it I could tell I was in the hands of amateurs. They never made me care about the rare book the main characters were researching let alone the outcome of the story. And shame on the editors at Dial for letting such sleazy, ordinary cliches make it into this book. Don't waste your money on this one."
2,It Might Better Be Titled the Rule of Snooze,"Normally, I love these kinds of books. Katherine Neville's, The Eight and the Magic Circle were my favorite books until the Da Vinci Code came along. However, I found this book ponderous. Perhaps if I'd been a Princeton alum or even an Ivy Leaguer, I'd have been more interested. The plotting plods along, the mysterious coding in the Hypnerotomachia Poliphili seems poorly integrated into the text and the love story is stilted. The book is far more plausible in pace and plot than the Da Vinci code, but the thrills simply aren't there. I thought I would love it, I didn't."
1,this book=garbage,"started nicely. but then it dragged on into nothing for 200 more pages. i can't believe this is a best seller. i found after about getting through the middle i was skipping pages to see if anything new would occur. nope, just more nothing about nothing. unfortunately, it's the kind of nothing that is also not entertaining. i couldn't believe the climax of this book was just so bad. no originality at all. i knew i should have stopped reading after the fire, nothing good would come of it.plus it took these guys 6 years to write this book! seems either inspiration or talent has eluded these authors."
3,"Great premise, Weak research","This much hyped book is at least worth a look, while I think that the many comparisons to Brown, et al are stretches. Where this story goes wrong is in the lack of detail, the story falls into a long drawn out buddy tale rather than the mystery/thriller I had hoped for. The endind is solid, although it does not really tie up any loose ends, hopefully a sequel is in the works so that we can get some answers."
2,"Great Idea, Lousy Book","These guys had a great idea for a DaVinci Code-type thriller, but then ended up writing about coming of age at Princeton that might prove of interest to someone who actually went to Princeton. Maybe the sequel will actually deal with the interesting premise the authors raise."
2,Not quite...,"I liked the Da Vinci Code much more, and had trouble getting into this one. Still, it had it's fun moments."
2,Don't expect much. Save your money and buy another book,"It's not Da Vinci Code.. It's not much of anything other than 2 young Ivy grads' attempt to boast their above average intellect. Two author's must have figured out that Da Vinci Code type religion/mystery/enigma novel can net them a healthy profit so they went to work and came up with the ""Rule of Four"". Thankfully, I borrowed this book and saved $20. What a waste of money that would have been.It's very simple. In the book you will find, ""This is the culture of Princeton which you have obiously never experienced so I will tell you"" part and ""Here is an old book that is boring as hell but since you don't know anything about it, I will tell you and convince you that there is more to this book"" part.If you want some historical intrigue with a bit of conspiracy theory, read ""Trojan Odyssey"" by Clive Cussler. You will find that 2 pages in the middle of ""Trojan Odyssey"" more interesting than entire book of ""Rule of Four"""
3,Decent Book,"I'm disappointed that so many people are comparing The Rule of Four to the Da Vinci Code. The only similarity that exists is the use of codes by the protagonists to solve a mystery. I find the book entertaining, not really intellectual, although it does mention other cultural works (from literature to art) about which one may like to found more information. The book, in general, has slow and fast sections. I thought that the flashbacks were slow but, all in all, I thought the book was engaging. My recommendation is to get it from your local library before buying it."
2,Not my cup of tea,I was curious of this book because of all the hype and comparions to the Da Vinci Code. I might have enjoyed it more if I was a history major. But Angels & Demons is still my favorite book over Da Vinci Code.
4,Thesis Thriller,"This is the most gripping and fun read I have come across during the past 12 months (since finishing my own doctoral dissertation). I found it challenging, interesting, exciting, motivating, and well written. I bought copies for my friends and will give them away. Don't listen to the bad reviews -- read it for yourself."
2,not even close to dan brown,this book was poorly written and quite boring. sometimes silly at the worst times too.
2,Pretty lame book,"Wow, this book is quite a disapointment. Someone had said it was a lot like DaVinci code. it wasn't even close. the writing style is really uninteresting, there was no character development, and i couldn't have cared less about this big mysterious document people were willing to kill each other over. I can't believe that someone would have published something on this level, it seemed quite amateurish. To tell you the truth, i've forced myself to read it, and i have about 20 pages to go, but i think i'm just going to toss it in the trash, i have no desire to continue... hope this helps!"
2,Really Disappointing,"Don't believe the lie on the front cover--""if you loved The Da Vinci Code...dive into this"". It should be more like ""if you loved the Da Vinci Code you will be devastated by how bad this is.""The book is quite fractured (the result of 2 authors?). Many fits, starts and narrative themes that go nowhere. The ending is terrible and totally anti-climatic."
2,I wish I had read the Amazon reviews before purchasing....,"I know that everyone would much rather hear a positive book review than a negative one, however I really wish I had read the multitude of negative Amazon reviews before I wasted my money on this book. I felt that, plain and simple, this book is a Dan Brown rip-off. This book was mediocre at best, not terribly well-written, and only fairly entertaining. If you're looking for a book that is in the league of The Da Vinci Code you probably want to keep looking. This book completely lacks originality. If you haven't read The Da Vinci Code yet and you're even considering this book- don't- just get The Da Vinci Code and enjoy a much better page-turner."
1,Don't waste your time!,"This was one of the worst books I've read. How it ended on the ""NY times bestseller"" list is a mystery to me. The plot was intresting, but not compelling. The endless monlogue was exhaustive, the flashbacks confusing. The authors droned endlessly on about stuff that wasn't intresting and completely glossed over aspects that could have deepened the plot or made the charachters more intresting. If you're looking for a fast paced novel, this is not it. However, if your willing to sit down and really think about a book and invest a lot of time and effort into something that won't return the favor, this is your book."
1,"All hype, no substance","I put this book on reserve at the library about three weeks ago. At the time, I was about #315 on the holds list, so I expected to wait a couple of months for it. Imagine my surprise when I was notified two days ago that it was in. I was also surprised to see the excellent condition of the book I picked up. Usually a book with many holds deteriorates pretty badly by the time it's been through a couple hundred readers. In fact, the condition was so good, it sent up a red flag in my mind. Were people finding it unreadable and returning it after having it for a short while? After reading 138 pages, I believe the answer is ""yes"". Obviously written by amatuers, the book is slow, dull and complicated. You know, there are so many books and so little time. Don't waste your money on this, and more importantly, don't waste your precious reading time! I'm glad I didn't buy it, and can take it back to the library tomorrow."
1,Negative 5 Stars,"I totally fell for the hype of this book and bought it right away. I started reading it, but became bored very quickly. After reading more reviews prasing the book, I decided to give them the benefit of the doubt and thought I must have missed the boat and decided to start reading from the beginning again. I should have listened to my gut. It took me 2 weeks to get to page 200 which is a rarity for me. This is one of the most boring books I have read. Too many characters, too much back story on how everyone met and knows each other, and not enough action. Not even worthy to be in the same sentence as the Da Vinci Code much less compared to it. Negative 5 stars! My copy is for sale on Ebay."
2,Trying too hard,"I wanted to like this book, but it just didn't pull me in. More hype than content, and nowhere near as good as Perez-Reverte's, The Club Dumas or The Flanders Panel. A lot of people are trying to get on the DaVinci code bandwagon and I'm afraid we will see a lot more of this sort of story, some good, some bad. The clues in this story were so far fetched that no one but the authors could have found them and the subject matter was too obscure to be entertaining. Good try, but no blue ribbon."
2,"Alright, but not what it's being touted as........","The book was okay - but nowhere near the caliber of ""Davinci Code"", ""Focault's Pendulum"" or ""The Eight"". Nelson DeMille must have been drunk or paid a lot of money for his review (printed on back jacket cover). It's not a nail biter. This is really a book about four college boys and their coming of age. Men who lived in dorms or were in a fraternity would probably enjoy this for that reason. The authors jump around a lot in time - difficult to follow in spots. The manuscript ""hypnerotomachia poliphili"" is presented more factually in bits/pieces than dramatically - doesn't have the ""umph"" it's supposed to. Wish I would have read the other reviews first - probably would have gotten at the library vs. buying it."
4,This book is worthwhile--despite the recent bad reviews,"This book is more similar to The Secret History, by Donna Tartt, than anything written by Dan Brown. This book is not a page turner, and the writing wanders around time and space too much. At times I was a bit confused about what was happening when, and there was no reason plotwise for this to happen. Overall the prose is good, though sometimes forced, but there are some lovely and insightful tidbits in it, and the ending is excellent. Although I agree with the reviews that say this book is too long, and the characters are not very round or sympathetic, the key decision (to choose an academic passion or a full life with loved ones) of the main character is very deep and engaging, and this combined with the ending, which I only wish were not fiction, make this book worth reading. With a more discriminating editor, this book would have been a five-star masterpiece."
4,"Good, but not the Da Vinci code",I really enjoyed reading this book. It is not simply a thriller like the da vinci code in that there is much more focus on the lives on the characters than simply on the mystery of the hynertomachia.
2,THIS IS NOT THE DA VINCI CODE,"Well I got hooked on Dan Brown. Read all his books. His thrillers are well-written and interesting. This book, however, is very disappointing. The authors are not to adept at weaving a stort together, and the characters are poorly drawn. Sorry to say that this is not an exciting summer read."
2,Whether compared to DVC or not - DON'T BOTHER !,"What the heck - I read it all the way through. Sure enough, it was a disappointment, and not worth the time. (Gee, maybe I should have scanned some Amazon.com reviews first and looked at the overall rating...) Whether you ""compare"" it to The DaVinci Code or not, it really doesn't even stand up well on it's own. The plot's implausible, you never really connect with any of the characters enough to care about them, and, unless you're a rather immature high school or college boy, it's basically pretty silly. How did it rate ""Best Seller"" status? Hype, I guess. Sure glad I got it from my library and saved some $. (Sorry Amazon.)"
2,These guys aren't prodigies,"I had high hopes with this book. For a book that took several years to write, it certainly didn't have much to show for the effort. The actual deciphering of the code is so anticlimactic, and the final secret so blase that I almost groaned in disappointment.A lot of people liked Da Vinci Code, but I liked Angels and Demons better (both by one author). So if that means anything, so be it. This book doesn't come anywhere close. The life described in Princeton is made to sound normal, but for most of us that didn't go to Ivy League schools, it doesn't give a lot to identify with. Isn't that especially important when the book is in first person narrative? All the while I'm reading the ""I"" of the book, I'm thinking, ""thats not me...""So... nice try guys. How about a little more meat on the plate next time you come up with a serving?"
2,Rather complex,"If you are expecting something along the lines of Dan Brown or National Treasure, this is not it. If you have some familiarity with the Humanist era, especially Italian history, the story is intersting. The twists and turns, both of the current day story and the history, can be difficult to follow. Some of the ramblings of the primary character almost seem to have a ""stream of conciousness"" feeling, also making it a bit difficult to follow. Still, if you are interested in the era, and in DaVinci Code like stories, it is worthwhile to finish."
2,Riding the Wave,"This book seems to ride the ""Da Vinci"" wave: we take something from History, imagine some great secret that would change the world if discovered, insert some riddles in the text, make it at least 500 pages, and thus have a new masterpiece.Where the ""Da Vinci Code"" is a great book that keeps you occupied, this book is a drag.In the ""Hypnerotomachia"" there were large sections which were mainly thought to be filler, but later proved to be significant. In the ""Rule of Four"" there are similar sections that seemed to serve no purpose, but perhaps I missed all the hidden messages in them."
3,Unexpected,"I agree that the descriptions of this story were very misleading. I was expecting something closer to a Dan Brown book, but no such luck. I had a hard time with the time dimensions of the story, so while reading I often thought that actions were taking place late at night only to find out that they were going to dinner. I also thought that the whole girlfriend issue was a little two-dimensional.That being said, it was entertaining but ""Da Vinci Code,"" it is not. If you go into the book not expecting anything you will be able to enjoy it much more."
2,Not what it seems,"If you are looking for the next Da Vinci Code, don't look here. Despite what the book promotes itself as, it is not a high speed thriller. This is a confusing, frustrating, and boring book. If you really want to read a good thriller try ""The Genesis Code"" by John Case, otherwise just save your money."
2,a product of hype and good marketing,"This is a mediocre book that seems to have benefitted from good marketing and a lot of hype in the wake of The Da Vinci Code.I do not believe the book bears any comparison to the works of Dan Brown, even though it had the plot potential. To me, the narrative seemed disjointed and there were many pages of what I would characterize as just fill, words that really didn't advance the story or help us to know the characters better.Unfortunately, before I got to the end, which to me bordered on being silly, I realized I actually didn't care much how it all turned out. Save your money and if you want to read this one get it at the library. l"
3,Disappointing,"Whoever said 'Move over, Dan Brown' has their wires crossed. In Dan Brown's books, you can participate in the puzzle-solving. In 'The Rule of Four', the characters merely tell you what they figured out."
3,Not as good a read as Davinci Code,"Interesting concept but the story telling aspect is not as mature as Davinci. Developing characters and explaining things by jumping back and forth in time just slows the book down. Also, there just isn't the punch to the story like DaVinci. It never really grabs you. Maybe because we have no idea of why the book they are researching has any significance.At least in DaVinci you start with a spectacular murder and the action starts immediately. By the time you get to the payoff in this book you've spent more time on character development and friendships than in wondering why I should care if they figure the book out.A good first effort but not a great read."
1,Oh no! a lame attempt to the Da Vinci Code remake,"I concur with the others in that this book is a total waste of your money and your time. It took a great deal of effort to finish it. I bought it on the Helsinki-Stockholm night ferry thinking this would make wonderful reading hours after having finished the outstanding Da Vinci Code and Angels and Demons from Dan Brown.Sure, when I read the reviews on the backcover I was mislead into thinking it was going to be exciting and that it was on a Da Vinci code class. I knew it was going to be a copycat attempt of some unknown authors into trying to cash out and tag along the success of truly interesting books (Da Vinci Code). WRONG!!!! the story was slow, the plot quite boring, the ""code"" was lame.I don't know why I even bother to write the review. Oh yes! it is to warn others from making the same mistake!"
4,Not that bad,"I'm pretty surprised by the trashing this book is getting in recent reviews. I don't have an opinion on how students at Princeton speak and some minor elements of the story were hokey, but on the whole this was an entertaining and gripping read. I really was intrigued what the 'key' would be. But then I studied for a History of Art PhD at the University of London, and covered a lot of Mediaeval history as part of my undergraduate degree. Maybe it makes a difference. By way of comparison, I thought 'The Da Vinci Code' was complete tripe."
2,Not worth the hype,"I bought this book based on the rave reviews it received, especially compared to Dan Brown's works. Sorry - this book doesn't hold a candle to Brown's works. I had to read over 3/4 of the book to find any excitement at all. It was fair to compare it to Umberto Eco's works - just as boring. If you want excitement, check out anything by Douglas Preston and Lincoln Child."
1,If stick figures could talk...,"It isn't often I think a book deserves less than one star. The premise is interesting enough, but the Monty Python-esque plot line, identikit character development, and groveling adherence to political correctness make even something like Fyodor Gladkov's ""Cement"" a delight in comparison. In terms of the quality-to-hype ratio, this is probably the worst crap to hit the shelves in years."
2,Not even close to Dan Brown's novels...,"In my opinion, it would be really hard to write a book as good as either the Da Vinci Code or the Angels and Demons, but this book didn't even come close. The only reason I didn't put it down after reading the first half because I like to finish the books I start. The first half was boooooring! I wanted to read about the secrets hidden in the 500 year old book not about life on campus at Princeton. And I had to go back some pages a few times too as I got confused about who was who? It did get better in the second half, a little more exciting, but I'm glad it wasn't any longer :)"
3,Ivy league students apparently have less fun than the rest of us,"The first half of this book is a look into the life of four Ivy league students. I don't know about you, but in college I had more fun and more drama on a daily basis than these fictional characters."
1,Rubbish !,I picked up this book....coz I hoped to find another Da Vinci code....but the rule of four is a slow n dragging book...there is no suspense or no mystery...n the characters lack depth ! There is unnecessary descriptions of private lives...which make for very very boring reading ! Stay away from this ! N I am absolutely not looking forward to the next book by I.C AND D.T !
3,Overall Good book but no Da Vinci!,"I agree with most of the reviews. This book was interesting, as it had to do with a very rare book. BUT, its dialogue was terrible in spots, and too much emphasis was placed on this ridculous eating clubs. Hope they can iron out the kinks in their next book.In my opinion, this book should not even be mentioned in the same breath as Dan Brown's Da Vinci Code. By the way, did everyone hear that Tom Hanks was going to be playing Robert Langdon???"
1,most overrated book of the decade,I am sorry for the time I spent reading this book hoping that it will change at some point..
2,What happened?,"Okay, I haven't quite finished the book. I'm on Chapter 12. Usually it take me less than a week to finish a good book. It's been 4 weeks. I put down the book for awhile to read another. Thus far, the book has been slow..."
1,"It Stinks, Pure and Simple","Yes, I could sit here and think up something witty to say, but you are reading this to get my opinion. The book stinks. It is not intelligent. It is not captivating, and halfway through the book, I no longer care what the characters are about. I threw my copy away because I couldn't give it away."
2,Everything you never wanted to know about Princeton...,"...and had no intention of ever asking.It's the same old story we've all lived through or heard/seen about a thousand times. Ah college life, pranks, pitfalls, break ups, make ups, booze and sex and a little studying on the side.The whole time I was reading this (when I could keep my eyes open) I kept thinking that this story would have been much better in Bret Easton Ellis' hands. The character development is forced and comes from nowhere, leading to nowhere. The dust jacket's comparison to Umberto Eco is offensive. Dan Brown is a tolerable writer but at least he's entertaining where as these guys have produced a first rate yawner. This is just simple a boring book and in the end nothing really happens.Don't believe the hype. If you have to read it, get it from the library or spend a weekend afternoon in your local Barnes and Noble and read it for free."
1,The Rule of Four,This book promises suspense and drama but does not come through at all. It is a boring book. When something finally does happen to a charater you don't care. There are times when you don't know if you are reading about present time or history. It flops all over the place. It leaves the reader bored. It never really gets to what the Hypnerotomachia is or what it means. I do not recommend this book.If you want good books read Dan Brown or Vince Flynn.
2,A very average book,"I checked this out from my library because I thought it would compare to the DaVinci Code. Boy, was I wrong.The first 100 pages are filled with flashbacks that are not relevant to the story. I nearly put it down for good but it started to get better at that point. However, the author only devotes about 75 pages to the mystery of the ancient book the main characters are trying to decipher. The last 100 pages were somewhat more interesting.Althought the premise is good, the author trys to combine a Davinci Code-like plot with a coming of age story-it doesn't work, believe me. I'll probably give the author one more shot but that will be it."
2,Overhyped,"While hyped to fans of Dan Brown's work, mostly by supposed well-read employees at Borders, this book failed to deliver on too many accounts to mention."
2,So-so,"I would say that this book is incomparable to The Da Vinci Code or Angels & Demons. It has it's own right. It's not as fast-paced as DVC. It's purely narrative. There are some part of the book where Tom Sullivan the narrator drifts away. There are some parts that are amusing, there are some parts that are dragging. And the mystery of the Hypnerotomachia doesn't seem to be a mystery at all. Maybe it's just me, it probably didn't meet my standards because I expected it to be high-octane and breathless like DVC or A&D;, based from what the advertisements said.Readers who are patient should read this, but if you are looking for high-octane action or fast-paced controversialthriller, this book is not for you. It's a light read."
4,Don't judge the book by it's cover blurbs...,"...it's better than they portray. I'm not sure why this book keeps garnering comparision to The DaVinci Code. The Rule of Four is a different kettle. The characters have depth and sustained, believable back stories. The novel has a compelling plot, but the pacing is gentler and less unnerving than Brown's. I did find the ending predictable--and still enjoyable. The evocation of college life is excellent, if somewhat nostalgic (it made me want to go back). Overall, the novel is more of a layered literary read than I expected from the blurbs and the hype. I highly recommend it."
1,Horrible,"This book, which promises to be like a Dan Brown Novel, is not even close. This is actually the first book that I did not finish - that is how bad it is. Not only is the subject matter tediously borning - it is poorly written and horribly structured. If I could give it zero stars I would"
1,No Way Near The DaVinci Code!,"I purchased this book because it was tauted as The DaVinci Code for 2004. NOT! Where the DaVinci Code engaged the reader in the problem solving and code breaking, in The Rule of Four, the reader is spoon-fed the answers. I was very satisfied with the DaVinci Code, esp. when I would get the answers to the cyphers correct. I am so disappointed in The Rule of Four, that maybe I will just set it on fire too, though I doubt anyone would martyr themselves rescuing it..."
1,Just not a good book,"It's not gripping. It's not touching. It's not intelligent. And the prose is dull.I could accept the bland stock characters if the story were compelling but it isn't.The ""mystery"" advances on clues less sophisticated than Encyclopedia Brown, one of the clues even a riddle I remember from the third grade.The only thing I liked about this book were the reproduced prints from the Hypnerotomochia.If at some point aliens or zombies showed up, then at least i could have had a good laugh.I bought it based on the positive customer reviews; now I see that it is the same five or so positive customer reviews appearing again and again under different headings. cheap trick. cheaper than the book."
2,Not what you think,"If you are looking for something fun and escapist like the Davinci Code, look elsewhere! This book spends more time on the pretensions of the second tier Ivy -- Princeton than it does on the overall mystery. This is NOT a thriller, rather an overblown portrait of college buddies involved in a pretty boring literary adventure."
1,Pfft. This is just stupid.,"I read a prerelease copy of this book way back in the day. Well, the first few chapters anyway. This book is just stupid. Try Umberto Eco, instead."
3,good for a long flight.,"I had wanted to read this book for a while before I actually got my hands on a copy. I read it on a long plane ride, and it certainly helped distract me from the discomfort of flying. The character development was good, but the plot wasn't as suspenseful as other books in the genre like Dan Brown's masterwork. I enjoyed the book and would recommend it to others with an interest in history and/or Renaissance art and culture. Or if you want insight into Ivy-League goings-on, then this book may also intrigue. I look forward to seeing what other creations these two authors may come up with as they gain more professional writing experience."
2,Trying to hard to copy others' success...,"I was enjoying the book for the first fifty or a hundred pages, but it doesn't really go anywhere. I felt disappointed when I reached the end."
2,BORING!!!!,"I was very excited to see this book out in paperbook and I rushed out and bought it. I kept an open mind, actually believing and hoping that this book was going to be better than Da Vinci code. Boy was I wrong. It is boring beyond belief. The actually mystery doesn't start until about page 130, the rest is complete and utter filler. I don't know if these 2 guys had not enough real plot to fill a book or if they really think that people are interested in their 'glory' days from College...obviously that is where the influence came from. And if I had to read that ""Tom"" had another queasy stomach, I thought MY stomach will go queasy! Unreal and unbelievable. Just a side note: what college guys drink WINE in their dorm!?!? Honestly, these guys comes across as weenies and not heros!On the positive side, it seemed to be well written but by NO MEANS is this a page turner! If you are looking for a faced pace, hard to put down read, this is definitely NOT IT!!"
4,A slow-moving mystery,"To those looking for another Dan Brown novel: stop.The Rule of Four is a story that is half about a mysterious ancient book and half a character study of four Princeton seniors. I enjoyed both aspects of the novel, although both ended a bit abruptly. The new authors do a good job but there are some plotting issues that make it clear that they are, indeed, new to the craft.Overall a well-written book."
4,Very Good But Not Great,"The Rule of Four is a very good novel but not a great one. If The Da Vinci Code is a ten then The Rule of Four is a seven. The book is generally fast paced but does lag and drift off at times. The four main characters are very well developed. Each has a distinct personality with all of the strengths and flaws of any human. There is an easy rythum to the writing style. While some of the references are esoteric, they don't interfere with the basic plot. Overall, it is a good, quick read worth the time."
2,Boring love-story; wished for more on art history,"Like many, I bought this book thinking it would be something like the Da Vinci Code. Never having heard of the Hypnerotomachia, I was intrigued (and have even purchased a copy of the Hypnero). Unfortunately, the book is mis-hyped as an art history/intellectural thriller, when in fact it is a boring love-story: something one would read in a creative writing seminar. The major redeeming value of the book simply is the introduction of the mystery surrounding the Hypnerotomachia to the masses, in much the same way the Da Vinci Code introduced alternative Christian history to a wide readership. But other than that, I found myself speed-reading through the love, the fights, the murders in a vain attempt to try to find the good stuff."
3,Good First Work,"These guys made a good first attempt at a novel, but the history aspects made the work a little heavy and hard to read...plus I kept looking things up which was very distracting.This is in no way meant to discourage these gentlemen, but I hope they get a little lighter in the future.I was glad I read it to the end, but I'm glad I got it from the library."
1,Don't buy this book,"Do yourself a favor and check it out from the library or borrow it from a friend if you are curious. This book has some nicely-written moments but the plot meanders, and the authors have chosen to move the story back and forth in time frequently without notice. There are too many characters, many of which are indistinguishable from one another. Too much Princeton in-crowd pedantry. If you're looking for a good beach read or something to pass the time on an airplane, this book will not hold your attention."
1,Boring book with cheap publicity!!!!!,This is one boring book which is stealing publicity by comparing with dan brown's books and other great authors!!!!!do not fall into the trapppp...it is strictly a piece of junk!!!
1,Gave up half way through,"The most boring book that I have ever listened to - the second might be o.k.but I gave up after really trying. However, I spoke to a friend who tried to read the Rule of Four and gave up after a few chapters. She said life was too short to waste her time - she is 85,"
1,Big Disappointment,"Although I read this cover to cover, I can only say this was one of the worst books I've read in a long time. The characters were 2-dimensional and the plot slow and predictable. This book felt like a writing assignment for creative writing 101, where obviously the goal was to write everything you know about your school. I feel like I've spent 4 years at Princeton just getting through this book! Don't waste your precious time, but pick up one of the many great books out there. I wondered how 2 people could co-author a book, and now I know...they can't."
2,"Painfully Slow, Difficult to Follow, Poor Ending",This book is painfully slow. The author's try to develop characters but instead they put the reader to sleep. The characters are dull and uninteresting. The author's develop a jumbled timeline that is difficult to follow. The ending seems sudden and abrupt.
1,Interesting Premise; Bad Writing,"I am stunned to read people comparing this book to Umberto Eco. It is insulting to Eco. This book reads like an undergraduate writing project. It has an interesting premise, but that is about it. The writing is dull and the characters are wooden and not really likable. I know they don't re-make books like they do movies, but if a good writer re-made this book it might actually be interesting.I applaud the authors for getting this published and making money on it. They should thank God for Dan Brown. Without the success of the Da Vinci Code, this sophmoric book would never have been published, let alone promoted so shamelessly."
1,yuck!,"This is the most boring, poorly written book I have read in a long time. It really was awful. I do not recommend it to anyone. I listened to it on a road trip and if we hadn't been confined to the car with nothing else to do we would never, ever have bothered to finish it. It was so obviously a ""first book"" by a couple of guys who think they are smart but can't write worth a lick."
1,Don't waste your time,"I rarely buy bestsellers, but after hearing a review for this book, I was curious. What a mistake! The plot was weak, the characterizations were cardboard (at best), and the ""mystery"" was a joke. Seriously, there is nothing to this book."
1,What a wreck of a book,"I only finished it because I was stuck on a plane. What a mess - who cares about endless boring details of the Princeton experience?? Choppy, repetitive, confusing, unbelievable circumstances and poor story telling combined with a story that has no payoff - I get angry thinking of how I wasted my time with this book because of any comparisons to Dan Brown. Did these guys not have an editor or anyone who read this prior to printing? Avoid."
2,What a Disappointment,"I was totally disappointed while reading this book. I kept hoping that it would get exciting. As soon as the book would pick up another section would appear that was wordy, overly descriptive and even boring at times.The romantic part of the story could have been good but that was also lacking in interest. All in all - read The Da Vinci Code and leave this one in the bookstores. It's hard for me to believe that this one of the top 5 sellers of 2004."
2,An interesting premise unfulfilled,"This book starts slowly but, given the subject and the characters, this is forgivable. The best comes in the middle of the book where the mystery begins to unfold and the characters address the riddles. It is at this point that this book most closely resembles The DaVinci Code.However, the ending ruins all of the gains of the rest of the book. The authors resort to a cliche so well-worn that I am surprised the editors accepted it. In a book with a different tone, it may have gone over well. But in this book it falls flat and takes you completely out of the narrative. The characters' final actions make little sense given the cursory treatment of their motivations in the preceding portion.Ultimately the clever mystery can not overcome the ending."
2,Don't believe the hype...,"...on the dust cover. After an intrigueing introduction the reader is left floundering about college life as lived at Princeton. It is not ninety or so pages have boringly transpired does anything relating to the plot take place. And when something does finally occur, the actual subject matter is murky and only obtusely explained. Frankly, not worth the effort."
1,Big Disappointment,"If you're looking for a successor to ""The DaVinci Codes,"" keep looking. This isn't it, despite what some reviewers have said.At the halfway point I wanted to scream: Enough with the Princeton recollections, get on with the story. That's where I bailed out.I rarely quit on a book, but if there was a good plot line here it got lost in endless rememberings of the ""good old college days"" that are totally meaningless to outsiders, those unfamiliar with the dining clubs, etc.There may have been a good idea behind this novel, but it escaped me. If you're not a Princeton Tiger, don't waste your time."
1,Crapulescent,"One flaw inherent in Amazon's rating system is that shoppers are unlikely to buy items unless there is a pretty good chance they'll like their purchase. As a result, reviews tend to skew positive. That being said the huge number of one-star reviews given to ""The Rule of Four"" bears witness to just how awful this book is. I should have paid heed to that warning.I am in awe of reviewers who could stomach 130 pages, or even (ugh) all of this book. I gave up on page 69, shortly after this gem...""In a feathery explosion of pages and paperbacks, my mother and father fell to the floor, and the needle of destiny tightened its stich and shuttled on.""I gave up attempting to read this thing 3 days ago, and am just now able to keep down solid food. You've been warned."
1,May never know,"My wife ordered this as a part of a Father's Day gift for me. I recently retired and have chosen gardening as on of my hobbies. She ordered the handle and a cultivator to attach to the handle. The handle came within a couple of weeks and still we waited another couple of weeks for the cultivator. We kept checking our order and it said not shipped yet. I think it was a week before Father's day when we got an e-mail saying it was no longer available. How nice, I have this very nice but useless handle. I could get a different tool for the end of it but at the time and still now I want the cultivator. So yes I have a very nice handle with nothing attached to the end. I am not happy having this stick."
2,Handle and rake,Great - I got a pole. The actual rake - ordered at the same time is now backordered until the end of Nov or early Dec (it supposedly was available at time of order). This is a seasonal item. I'll have a great time doing leaves with the pole!
5,Wolf Garten Tools,I love Wolf Garten tools. This time I bought the long handle and absolutely love it. The quality of these garden tools is excellent and very functional. Plan to eventually get them all!
3,"It will be good, but...","I purchased the Wolf bow rake from Amazon a few weeks ago, not realizing I had to dish out another 20 bucks for the handle. The quality of the bow rake is good -- so I decided to bite the bullet and buy the handle from Amazon today. After I made my purchase, I found out that other on-line vendors [e.g., gemplers.com] have all the Wolf-garten stuff for much cheaper. I guess I could've canceled my order and tried calling Amazon for its price match guarantee -- but spending 30 minutes on the phone to save 10 bucks wasn't worth it to me. I expect the quality of this handle to be good (just like the rake attachment), but Amazon may not be the best place to puchase these items."
5,Interchangable rake handle,This is the same hardware as the old Scotts brand garden tools that are no longer on the market. Completely interchancable! Excellent quality.
3,STANDARD SOUTHERN,"Pianist Jeri Southern covers standard jazz tunes well, but falls short of showcasing her finest talents. The brief keyboard solos highlight an otherwise, well, standard entry."
1,This book sucks!!!!!!,"Don't waste your time or money on this worthless piece of junk. The so-called algorithms are written to run under DOS and will not run under Windows 95 ,NT,98, without throwing errors. If you can find a fossilized computer somewhere, maybe you deserve this mess!!! (Normally I wouldn't even give this one star, but negative numbers aren't possible.)"
2,Microsoft Office 2003 INSIDE OUT,"Huge book, difficult to handle. Takes a lot of patience going back and forth from chapter and sections.Will continue to try to master a very complicated but necessary software."
2,Better Fender References are Available,"I bought this book first, before coming across Richard Smith's more definitive history of the Fender Story in ""Fender The Sound Heard Round the World"".This Six Decades of Telecaster is mostly a picture book and light on the Tele story. It does contain a decent Reference Section, which gives a year by year breakdown of the unique features of the Telecaster.If you want the Fender Story, get the Richard Smith book. Additionally, I purchased the Fender: The Inside Story book, but it is not an ""impartial"" telling of the story."
3,It held my attention,"Honestly, I bought the book based on the quotes by authors I was familiar with. I understood where Brinkman was coming from in relating to his ""job"", but the whole thing with the teenage girl was a bit of a stretch. Yes, it can be a small world but for the two women of his life to meet the way they did was highly unlikely and unreal. I did enjoy his views on politics and the STZ commentaries. The cable movie interpretation should be interesting."
3,"interesting, observant, but very few laughs","i expect satires to be funny...although i found the book readable, i was just hoping, praying to come across a passage that would make me laugh out loud...i like farley's observations on american society and people , but his vitriol is extremely hard to take at times...i'm a minority, but i refuse to call myself a vicitim! the narrator blows off a woman because she has alot of kids, and he has sex with a woman who's barely legal and then runs away when he doesn't want to deal with responsibility; really mature, chris ! ...i guess this is a mixed review..farley has potential as a writer, but certain things about the book left a bad taste in my mouth... maybe blacks and whites want black books like this.."
2,"interesting, observant, but not very funny","i think farley has talent, and some scenes in the book are humorous, but i was looking and praying for a scene to come up that was fall-out funny...i just couldn't deal with with the vitriol at times...and thurgood messing around with a young girl totally turned me off..."
2,Very little new,I suppose the writer is limited by the denomination but this really has very little to add to the Book of Common Prayer
4,Good Book Overall,"I found this book to be quite good. Ray Stedman has a great understanding of Revelation. I especially liked the chapters regarding the seven churches. They contained a wealth of information.I had to downgrade it to four stars because of one area I sharply disagreed with him on. He says the 24 elders represent angels, not the church. I disagree. And the scriptures he uses to back up his claim do not support his view. Other than that I highly recommend the book."
1,Not good,"What the info fails to mention is that this is an import, and the sound quality is abysmal. In addition to not being able to hear all that well the music is surprisingly bad. You would expect an all-star lineup of Bootsy, Fred Wesley, and Maceo to crank out some good funk, but this sounds like sub-par imitation Parliament. I would not even take this CD for free."
2,Highly Inaccurate Weapons!!!!!,"I have read a number of 4-star reviews that really ought to be 3-star at best. The concept of the game is spot on, but the delivery is very weak. Especially with tanks and artillery, it is VERY hard to hit anything. I am usually ""dead"" before I can adjust, and even that is a guess because the graphics do not display depth very well. And then there is the problem with the sniper (""scout"") option, where you fire one shot, lose the scope and have to re-load before you can see if you hit anything. While all this might be an attempt at ""realism"" it is, ultimately, only frustrating."
1,Slow and Jumpy,This is one of the slowest games I have. If you have Windows XP don't buy it. The games is sligtly confusing if your a kid. But all in all it's an okay game. Except that the graphics jump like mad.Bottom Line -don't buy this game if you have windows XP-
1,Worst game ever after 1.01 patch,"I've been playing this game since day one but after the patch i dont want to play anymore. NEVER install patch 1.01 to this game. NEVER install patch 1.01 to this game!!!! It will make it WORSE!! It will crash to desktop every 5 minutes. Millions people have been reporting crash to desktop at EA board. And your ping will reach 1000 very often doesnt matter if you have cable or T3. Dont buy this game, its useless and waste your money. Never buy this game!! You love your money dont you?"
1,Would be nice if the game worked,"I have tried this game on 3 different computers. All with the min. requirements and nothing. I have nephew that got the game for Xmas, its still sitting on the shelf because it will not work on his computer either.These are all Win98 O/S with XP-1800 or better processors, 512meg ram, and with at least 64meg video cards. Everytime I call the computer they want you to spend money to try and get it to work. I am sadly disappointed in this game. I have been told that if it works its really nice to play... but... i have not seen it yet....:(a very unhappy customer"
4,Good Game,"This game is a very fun game. It combines strategy and fps to some extent. You replay many of the great battles from world war 2 such as battle of the bulge and midway.The only reason that this game does not get 5 stars is because of the incredible bulk of the game. I'm running a 2.26 p4 with 512 ram and 128 radeon and the game takes a good 2-3 minutes to load on my system. It is the biggest pig of a game that I have ever played, and consequently because of this fact, I am playing it less.But once you do get it up and running, its a blast."
2,This game was the jam 10 years ago,I tried reinstalling this some 10 years later to see how many people still play it and the sound for the guns didn't work with windows 7. I've uninstalled this and said its really time to move on. Though if EA would remake this series I would buy that.
4,Good game with some glitches,"Right to the point, all the missions in the european theater seem to run smoother, than those missions in the pacific theater, for instance Battle for Midway,has very poor frame rate, mouse movement is very choppy. Ea take a look at this problem will you, because a lot of gamers think its their computer, but its not. NEED A PATCH ASAP: disabled military viet nam era vet. Peace: Romeo Henry Faison....a hardcore gamer."
4,Great WW2 game,"Battlefield is one of the only games around these days that allows you to fly in planes, drive tanks, and dive in submarines, and still fight as infantry. Its pretty great. There are a few bugs in the game, but those should be worked out before long I imagine. This is definately worth the purchase."
5,One of my favorites.,"Battlefield 1942 is an excellent game. It has broad flexibility, great player-environment interaction, superb graphics and engrossing historical backing. All things that I look for in a FPS.It allows players to operate any vehicle or weapon system that you can find. This gives you a much greater sense of freedom than in comparable games like Medal of Honor. The graphics are also a step up when compared to similar games. The video card requirements may be higher than many games, but it is worth it. The best feature of all is the feature that allows you to play on different armies, select different insertion points, and select different player specialties.Overall BF 1942 is my favorite FPS. If you like flexible and historical games, then this should be top on your list."
3,Need plenty of ram,"It's a great game, but you do need at least 512m ram. Even a 2g proccessor with only 256m won't cut it."
3,Lol..,The game itself is fun..but for some odd reason it lags on my new gaming pc..i have no idea why?
4,"RIP OFF, for a great game","RIP OFF PART:All I can sat is... THIS GAME IS OVERPRICED, I SAW the game at Staples for $10, but I didn't get it there, oh no, I bought it at the DOLLAR STORE, as far as I'm concerned, your paying $17 for the case, $2 for the game, the 1 i got was in a smaller cd case,ACTUAL REVIEW:the game isn't bad at all, the graphics are ok(on medium low[my lap top sucks), the game supports custom controls along with input devices( joysticks, ps2 controllers, xbox wired controllers, etc), there is a good selection of vehicles( except for the planes, they are hard to control) if you played star wars: battlefield 1,then you know the feeling. the game is hard with a keyboard and a mouse, so i HIGHLY RECOMMEND GETTING A JOYSTICK, OR CONTROLLER,TECHNICALLY NOT A REVIEWthe game is easy to hack with cheat engine(# of troops)"
5,Awesome WW2 Shooter,"This game is an awesome WW2 shooter. It's weapons are modeled just like they looked and so are the vehicles. That's another sweet aspect of the game. They have all the tanks, planes, jeeps, mounted weapons, etc. I have never played the multiplayer on the game [which I wish to try sometime!] but i'm sure the single player campaings are just as good. The envioronments you play in are very close to what those battlefields really looked like. I think this is one of the best games on the pc, and I can't wait to try out the expansion pack [Road to Rome]. If you like awesome first person WW2 shooters, get this game!!!!!"
2,Great concept but wait until it's perfected.,"I played the multi-player demo a couple of times and, while the concept is really cool and had me excited about all the crafts you can pilot, the game play's just not good enough for me to purchase. I kept hoping that maybe the final product would be somehow better than the demo but that's rarely the case. Don't expect the arcade style action of Wolfenstein. I'm real glad I did'nt run out and just buy this one."
1,Huge Disappointment,"If you loved MOHAA, you will hate this game. Graphics are weak, and controls not as easy to work with. Save your money!"
1,Battlefield 1942 - The Pearl Harbor of War Games,"I find it interesting that Amazon had a bunch of negative reviews for this game. Now there are none. Where'd they go? Anyway, this is a terrible game. I have a 2.2 MhZ, 1024 Meg RAM, Radeon 8500, AND the patches and still the game drops out or freezes on me, even on the lowest settings. Graphics are marginal. A few things like the vehicles or buildings are OK but where are the jungles. What I hate is having to drive everywhere through open fields. It takes such a long time to find anyone to fight. Even then, it isn't fair because they appear out of nowhere, then you see a bullet flying towards you and then you're dead. Save your money and buy Medal of Honor instead. Battlefield 1942 is not even in the same class."
2,Slowest mouse response ever,"While I've played a lot of shooters, this one, even with the fastest adjustments, has the slowest mouse response of any game I've ever tried, and it's infuriating. Spoils the game completely--molasses meets the shooter. The vehicle controls are also remarkably primitive. Save your money for a future more refined version, and buy Return to Castle Wolfenstein in the meantime."
5,Wickedly hazardous to your schedule,"Do not buy this game if you are working on the cure for cancer, world peace, or a longer lasting light bulb. We need you to continue doing just what you are, right now. For anyone else that wants to have a blast playing the variety of roles and piloting/driving the many vehicles in BF 1942, then waste no time. This game deserves all of the ""Game of the Year"" awards it has received, and once you become adept at the keyboard and mouse controls (this takes a little time) you will find yourself immersed and enthralled in a fun, fast paced online multiplayer game."
5,Best FPS yet? Yes!,"I've played First Person Shooters for nearly 10 years now, and I've always wanted one like this. Other games have tried giving you control of vehicles, but none has done it as sucessfully as EA has now.Yes, the game is Bandwidth intensive, but once you find a good T1 hosted server it is so much fun!This game offers more ways to die than most any game I've ever played. My favorite method for allowing someone to rest in pieces is to run them down with a Jeep, Tank, or Armored Car. There is also alot to be said for killing a medic, then using his med kit to restore your own health.Teamwork makes this game one of the best ever. Grab a B-17 and fly around while your buddy mans the belly gun, or work as a spotter while your buddy fires the cannons on the battleship.Read the hardware requirments, but you should do that with any new game. The disc for this game has set up permant residence in my CD drive."
2,Not Worth The Money...Not even close,"I bought this game yesterday and i got a pentium 4 processor, 1.7 ghz, 512 mb ram, and a Nvidia Geforce 2 64 mb ram graphics card...and this game lags alot on single player...I installed the patch and it helps nothing...I tried it on another computer with all the same requirements except for it had 1.73 ghz,athlon processor, and ati graphics card and it worked alittle better but i still experiend lag...I dont know what is causing the problem but i might buy it again and try a different cd."
1,Don't waste your money!,This game fell far short of it's potential. The designers should look at Return to Castle Wolfenstein for an example of great game play.
2,Worst game ever,I have a pent 4 1.7 geforce3 still worse lag i have ever experiened. Don't buy this game unless you have a powerful system. Even when it ran decently it was still boring. I would NOT suggest this game to anyone
1,what were they thinking???????,what kinds of computers did they test this on? i have a decent computer and it completely doesn't work--i ended up playing at my friends house. everyone should go buy Medal Of Honor instead--it's much better anyway
2,EA Games could have done better,"Battlefield 1942 could have been much better. It was written as if some amateur team at EA had done the work. Guns are not very realistic nor are the troops. EA's games in the MOH series are so much better and I would stay with that series. Either way, better have a computer with some power and be ready to tweak it maybe. I had to set (I use XP) paging (Virtual Memory) to allow auto setting as needed. This prevented crashes. By the way. I'm an Army vet and age 65!"
3,Lots of large empty spaces,"Overall a game that only comes to life when played with a large number of other players. Otherwise it can be frustrating running around and trying to find something to look at. Graphics are quite good and it ran well on my system P4 with ATI graphics card. I didn't like some of the sound effects, though. I think that action games such as Unreal Tournament and Quake III are more fun."
4,"good game, but laggy","My computer meets AND exceeds the system requirements for the game, yet, it is laggy. I play on fast servers (GameSpy Arena) and yet, it's slow. I exit almost every other application running before I run the game, and it lags."
2,didn't get anywhere near my expectations,"After reading all of the reviews for BF: 1942 I decided I'd buy it...it seemed like a good game going by the reviews. It's really a bad game. the gameplay is terrible, it has a lot of glitches, and it takes 5-10 minutes to load a game. Don't expect this game to be very fun because of the flying...it's terrible...the only reason why I didn't give the game 1 star was because the tank missions are pretty cool."
1,Lockups and crashes,"Allied Assult worked just great, but Battlefield 1942 locks up and crashes so often it is unplayable. I'm sure it's something conflicting with background tasks or another configuration problem, but who wants to spend all day trying to figure out how to make the product work? I recommend trying another game and let the designers spend more time cleaning up the next version."
