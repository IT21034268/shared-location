4,Great for cycling,"Good comfortable fit. No pain from pressure on the ear. Stay in place. No ear surround to interfer with sunglasses or helmet straps. No ear buds to fall out with activity.Other headphones in this price range may have slightly better sound but for sports(especially bicycling) none offer the low profile, secure design that these provide."
5,stay put!!,"I live in windy south Texas and jog about 11 miles per week. I was using a pair of Sony in ear buds that I purchased for their noise canceling properties. The Sony's worked great and sound amazing. The problem I had was that they were always falling out of my ears once I started to sweat. After searching Hi and lo I ran across the MX55's. All I have to say is AMAZING! Just today I went for a jog and it was windy as hell! NOT ONCE did these things budge!!! They don't sound as great as my Sony's, but if you want a pair of buds that stay put and do what they claim, these are the way to go!!"
3,I would love it if I could use it,"These headphones come with sizes for the tiny piece that fits against the outside of your ear but one size fits all for the part that goes into your ear. In my case that part was too large and I couldn't fit it into my ear (well, I could fit it in the left ear but apparently my right ear is smaller). So I am giving them away. Judging by the sound quality and comfort in the left ear, they are terrific headphones!!"
1,Falls out of ears every 2 minutes,I am very disappointed by these headphones. They fall out of my ears every two minutes and I wish I had not purchased them.
3,"Good, but dont fit","I get those nice plugs. Sounds great, evrything is good but the are too big for my ears. Sell them, but sound was really good! If you have a larger holes in ears, go for it!"
3,"Decent, But Odd Product","I purchased these headphones specifically for use while jogging, since they are promoted as staying in the ears better than most competitors. Like other reviewers, I was surprised by the extent of the difference in length of the left and right ear cords. The difference is too extreme. Also, I've had difficulty getting a good fit, especially in my left ear. I've reached a reasonable solution, and now do use them for their intended purpose. But, overall, they are ""too much hassle"" for the benefit and I would not buy them again."
3,nice headphones (but...),"Just few quick words to share my MX75 experience,Pros:Build quality is OK (water resistant)Sound quality is OK (for street,travel,etc)Cons:Only available in greenThe chord is made-to-tangle. :("
5,sport headphones,these are a great set of sport headphones for the gym or during any vigorous activity. the sound quality is great and they do not knot! Love the little carrying case.
3,Useless Documentation,"It does not come with a manual other than the warning sheet telling you to not to play music too loud or get it wet with saltwater or run in traffic etc..No diagrams or written instructions on how to adjust it in your ear or what to do with the excess length of cables. The box only has marketing fluff.You just have to use trial and error to figure it out.I still don't understand what you are supposed to do with the uneven length cables. I saw people asking that question followed comments saying they guess you should probably run it behind your neck. However they were all ambiguous in how to do that. It drags and pulls it out of my ear if I put it behind my neck, so that makes no sense. If you put it in front, it's in your way and looks weird.I can't find a single photo anywhere clearly showing someone actually wearing it and what they did with the cables. Not even the Sennheiser website.If it was spelled out in the manual with diagrams, no one would be asking these questions."
3,"Bad sound, Good for sports","I just ordered a pair from here. The design is really cool and it seems to be pretty waterproof. The only negative about it was that the sound is just not very good. I compared these with my generic headphones that came with my Samsung mp3 player and these were way worse in terms of the bass and clarity. These are very ""treble-y"" sounding compared to my stock headphones I compared with. I guess if you're using them for sports, the sound quality is not that important, but they will do the job if you like jogging or going to the gym and listening to your music. Do not get them for sound quality and clarity."
3,good sound bad cord,"I bought this to replace one of their earphone sets I really liked. This has good sound, but the cord is to long and it is coiled. Every time I take it out to put it on I have to spend time to unravel all the knots. The previous style of earphones worked really well, but they don't sell it anymore. They should go back to the styles that work."
1,sennheiser sports headphones -,"These are not the headphones to purchase for strenuous exercise. The sound quality is questionable and they continuously fall out of your ears. Buy the Sennheiser PMX 80s. They are perfection, have fine sound and do exactly what a jogger, biker, blader, etc. expects of good headphones."
5,Best sport headphones I've ever used,"I just bought my second pair of these. I bought the first pair in January 07, and they would still be fine if I was more careful with storage. I usually go through a a couple pairs of earbuds a year, so even 18 months is a very long time for me. The sound is crisp and loud, the bass and highs are both great for sports use and endurance training."
2,Weak bass equals weak sound,"Since I workout and do cardio six days/week, I rely on my music to keep me motivated. These headphone have very little bass which, for me, make for a weak sound. With other headphones (like the ones that came with my iPod) I normally have the volume at about 75%. In order to achieve the same volume with the Senheiser's I had to crank it up to 95-100%. While they did stay in my ears, I was constantly messing with the green cord (trying to straighten it out) which was very long and never lost it's springy, curled-up shape."
1,Did not like!,These Sport earbud heaphones did not fit correctly despite my constant attempts to make them fit. After the 4th workout on treadmill I got tired of them and bought a different pair that I love to use.
1,Fell apart almost instantly,"These ear buds are super crappy and fell apart as soon as they were out of the package. The silver part comes off the housing quite easily, and the rubberized ear pads don't stay attached either. Finally, if you have small ears, the additional nubbin is useless."
2,dont buy these for using while running,"i have owned these for a couple of months. they fall out of my ears all the time. i am now upgrading to another pair of headphones. when i first bought them they held up ok. now after more time, the right ear bud falls out constantly and the one side longer than the other chord is annoying also."
1,The WORST earbuds I have ever owned,"Took the earbuds out of the box, fit the different rubber pads on them, tried them on, took them off, and threw them into the trash. My ears hurt for the next 20 minutes.These are by far the worst design in earbuds possible. The ""twist to fit"" protrusion is so big that the designer must have had ears the size of an elephants to come up with this disaster of a design.Further, the construction is CHEAP and plasticky, the rubber attachments only make the earbuds more and more uncomfortable. The length of the cable is quite short compared to regular earbuds. The changeable colour panels keep falling off the earbuds and the mesh covering the earpiece is very very flimsy.The best part about the earbuds is the case in which it comes which is stylish and good quality. Too bad the earbuds dont do the case justice.Shame on Sennheiser for producing such a piece of junk."
4,Sennheiser MX55V Stereo Headphones,"These headphones sound pretty good, but they aren't the best. When running, the volume controller gets in the way and bounces. It is also easy to change the volume which is annoying. I also find the fact that the cord for the right side is longer than the other a little bit strange. I realize it is done intentionally, but it does nothing for me. Overall, for just listening at your desk or in your room, these are great headphones. For running, I would recommend something else."
3,only ok,These are ok but the sound volume is pretty low. On a positive note they stay in my ears great. They also can make it through the washer and dyer and still work good. Nate
5,Excellent set for the active,Saw the earphones on Amazon and wanted to give them a try. I read many of the reviews and they were rated excellent on a consistent basis. After receiving the earphones I was quiet pleased. Once you find the proper attachment to fit your ear canal you are well on your way. I would definately recommend these earphones to anyone who loves to workout and listen to their favorite tunes.
4,What is with the longer wire,"These headphones sound great and stay in your ear with the wacky little pads that they put on them. For the price I don't know if you could get a better sounding set of headphones. The nice thing is that I can wear these much longer than the five dollar set I had previously before they get uncomfortable. So here is what bugs me about these. The carrying pouch, while it looks cool, doesn't keep the wires from getting all tangled up, why don't they make one of those plastic things that you spin with your fingers so the wires go around the outside. Secondly and many other reviews point this out, the right bud has a longer wire, about 6-8 inches, now I assume its so the shirt clip has enough slack to keep from pulling the ear bud out when you are jogging but seriously, that is super annoying. I would recommend them though just the same."
2,Poor quality of materials,"While visually appealing and an absolute GREAT fit in the ear for joggers/athletes, the plastic casing around the wire splintered in multiple places within a mere day of use-rendering them essentially useless. I was incredibly disappointed."
2,"For the price, utterly useless.","Sound quality is decent enough. Bass production is pretty much non-existent. My main gripe with the pair, however, is the fact that they are all too fragile. They saw very light use from me and even despite that they started falling apart very soon after purchase. The ear pieces have many components that are removable, and that is the problem. They are not secured well enough. They are constantly falling out. I own a wireless Sennheiser headset that I couldn't praise enough. But the pair in question is of very shoddy quality. I can't remember how much I paid for the pair, but if the current price is of any indication, I thoroughly got ripped off. They sound like a $10 pair and are of the quality of a $5 pair. I'd suggest buying them only when they fall to that price."
4,They do what they say they will- stay in!,"These earphones have decent sound quality and really do stay in. There is a little piece that secures the earphone by hookin in to the fold of the upper ear. Unfortunately, that piece hurts sometimes. I still think it's worth it because they stay in place, and I only wear them when I work out (40 minutes at a time)."
2,My ears must be too small...,"I had trouble getting these ear buds to go in my ear then stay in once I start sweating. I'm not trying to push them in my ear so I don't understand why this is happening. So overall I would say they are just ok since when I am able to get them to stay in my ear, which is when I'm hardly sweating, they work fine."
4,Best sport headphones on the market,"This is my 3rd attempt at finding the perfect sport headphones. I tried the Nike earbuds but they eventually broke. The Sennheiser headphones sound quality is definitely top notch compared to the other brands. I Spin bike, stair climb, etc... with mine and they never move out of place. I also like using the clip because it keeps the cord out of your way. Another plus, it includes a small carrying case for storage. My only negative is that the cord is alittle long."
4,Great earbud design,"I bought these headphones specifically for running. The standard white earphones that came with the iPods would stop working, I guess because they get wet with sweat. I had never used this type of design before and it is simply great, the earbuds stay in place perfectly and are very, very comfortable.For a while I could not understand why the chords connected to the earbuds had different lengths, and the longer one was kind of a nuisance while running, flapping around my neck. I recently realized that if I placed the longer chord behind my neck and into the ear, the fit would be perfect and the flapping problem was gone.One minor problem is that the chord does not lose its coiled shape, and it tangles very easily; it took me several minutes to unravel the cables before a run until I decided to wind it around the iPod.Sound quality is very good, at least enough to enjoy during a run."
4,Love them!,"This is my second pair of these headphones. They lasted about a year (5 days a week use) before I needed to buy new ones. I like the twist and fit action that keeps them in my ears when I run (even if I get really sweaty!) The only thing I didn't like was how flimsy the cord is,(I used the clip and if you slide it too much it will split the casing of the cord.) And the ear buds were a bit hard to get used to in the begining...Other than those two things I would buy a third pair when these go out!"
3,"Fits nicely, but bad quality","I bought these earbuds to go with my ipod nano. I like the buds...they fit well in the ear and have several different sizes that are interchangable. However, the connection is not very good. A lot of times I will only get sound in one ear, then I will need to fiddle with the connection to get it to play in both ears."
2,very disappointed!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!,very misleading reviews!....the bass in these is hardly worth mentioning and the poorly designed cord? why would you make one side longer than the other?....these are horrible don't waste your money on these!
2,Is Slightly Better Than Old One,The sound on the Sennheiser phone changes a lot. Sometimes the music is loud and sometimes low. The volume knob is not that good. The only good thing is that it partially stays in your ear. I cut off one piece because the two different cord lengths were annoying.
2,"Sure they work, but pass on this one",Not that comfortable and not that great sounding. Do yourself a favor and get some in-ear earbuds
2,There are better and cheaper items out there....not worth to buy,"I purchased these about 1 month back because the headphones that came with my current mp3 player fell out of my ear while on the treadmill. Thus, I purchased these because they were sweat resistent and claimed to stay in your ear while running. Well, 1 month later and I'm returning them for 2 reasons: 1) the right ear started producing static/crackling sounds. Thus, I can't listen to music clearly 2) the design of the ear phones hurts my ear. It really jams it in there and feels uncomfortable.Overall, I would look at other products. There are not great and overpriced."
2,Terrible design egrnomy wise,"The sound on these things is ok, I bought them for using in the gym, but the twist to fit feature is downright painful, please stay away from this product even if its on sale and you are tempted as I was."
2,Woops,"I had high hopes for this product when I purchased it. I was disappointed in the comfort level of these earbuds. They left my ears hurting after wearing for less then an hour, plus the sound was not that great. I did give them two weeks before I returned them. If you are like me and are considering getting in ear headphones or something like these, definitely go for the in ear."
2,Not for me.,These just didn't work with my ears. I ended up buying the Sennheiser sport headphones instead and love them.
2,Not impressed.,"I listen to a mp3 player for several hours a day while I'm at work, so I have tried many different sets of earbuds. This set has to be the worst ones I've ever used. They're uncomfortable, even after changing out the different size ear peices. The sound quality is horrible at moderate to high volume. And for some reason, that I cannot figure out, the wire on one side is more than twice as long as the one on the other side. I don't recommend them to anyone that has a good ear for audio quality. The only reason that I give them 2 stars is because, despite everything else, they do seem to stay in my ear pretty well."
3,cord is a drag,"These guys do stay in your ear better that regular earbuds, but the cord is indeed a pain. Why is the left side so much shorter that the right? The left side often pops out when I turn my head. Seems the cord divide should be more symetrical. Also there is no way to store these such that they don't tangle everytime you get them out. But I can deal with that. The asymetrical cord is a real drag"
1,Not so great - waste of money,I bought these headphones for my husband who works out and runs every day. They were uncomfortable and the sound quality was not very good. Didn't take long for the sound to go out in one of the earphones.
1,Stereo headphones for ipod,"The ear pieces are very difficult to keep in one's ear...I don't have a big ear or a small one, but somehow, the way this item is made, it just doesn't fit well...I do not recommend this product at all!!"
3,Screwed up cord,"I would have given this 5 stars but the cord on one side is shorter than the other. Because of this, the ear bud in the left ear falls out more often, even with the twisting. Other than that the twisting works well."
3,Fits well,Pros: Stays in your ear even with vigorous exercising. Doesn't get all tangled up like headphones that clips around your ear.Cons: Volume level doesn't get as loud as I'd like it to.
2,Don't work for my ears,"I have a hard time keeping iPod buds in my ears. I bought these because of the locking mechanism. That mechanism does work but doesn't keep the bud far enough into my ear to generate reasonable bass. I also find that even with the smallest pad, my left ear hurts after 10-15 minutes. If I hold them in place I can tell that the sound is quite good but having to hold them in place kinda defeats the purpose. I'd suggest trying these out in a store to make sure they suit your ear shape before buying."
2,No good for small ears :(,"When buying this product, I had hoped that the various silicone pads would allow the unit fit in my ear easily...well no such luck.The sound is wonderful and the construction looks tough enough for outdoor hiking and biking. But if you have small ears - - look some where else. Guess this will be sold to someone or donated to a friend.I plan to buy the around the neck version PMX70, hope those work and fit better."
3,great functionality for active people...,product is light stays in your ear Excellent range of dynamic range / sound quality...the only problem is the the green cord / shield tends to shred after 3 months of daily heavy use...i have purchased 3 sets over the last year... I only reorder them because there is no other ear phones that stay secure with heavy activity...
2,Jazzy Jeff,I had another pair of sennheiser headphones I liked better. These are irritating to the inner ear and the left and right sides are different lengths and easily get caught and ripped out of your ears while you are working out. I would not recommend these.
3,MX75 Fit Is Disappointing,"I purchased the MX75 to use while jogging. It may be due to my large ears, but the fit is not as secure as I had hoped for. They tend to loosen as I run and must be readjusted. The sound quality is great when they are snug."
2,not great,"These do stay put when you move and they are not that hard to figure out once you look at the picture on the website. However, the cord is horrible- it is way too long and it kinks. These also look very big and awkward. I returned mine and bought BudFits. I love them. I could not keep earbuds in for more than a minute or two when I was running, but the Budfits attach to the original ipod earbuds, are adjustable, keep them in place perfectly, and are less than $10. I think they would fit on most other earbuds besides just the original ipod earbuds.Innovelis BudFits - Vanilla WhiteInnovelis BudFits - Stealth Black"
1,Static Shock,"They worked well for about 2 weeks but the left earbud gave me a strong static shock, the kind you get when you touch your car.I was sitting down listening to the music with the earbuds in my ears for a while so it wasn't a build up on my part. At first I thought it was a one time ordeal and ignored it.Then it happened two more times. Sad, I liked these since they actually fit in my odd ears."
1,They hurt!,"They hurt my ears while running. Then if you try to adjust them while running, they fall out if you don't get them in right."
3,Great Sound but Wire Coating Comes Off.,"I looked at other reviews before purchasing this product for a friend as a gift. I was aware of the complaints of the green coating comming off the product. However I really wanted a product with great sound and many of the reviews discussed the great sound. I also wanted something designed to stay put while running because my friend was using primarily for running.Well. I can say that after about 6 months of use my friend had to throw the phones away because the coating came off and exposed the wires. However, the sound when they worked was superb. The design for keeping them put while running was also a plus. Basically these are great headphones that will last you a year if you are lucky. I am not sure if it is sweat or time that causes the coating to come off the wires. They sound great and work great but are basically disposable as they wear out very quickly."
3,Good sound quality but hurt my ears,"I purchased this product because I thought it would twist and fit in my ears, however I found that these earphones are not suitable for small ears. Even though they remained in my ears and did not fall out while I was running, I found that after approximately half an hour the top bud hurt my ears and I never got accustomed to them. The sound quality however what quite good but I cannot use these headphones for an extended period of time."
3,Great for the gym,"These headphones stay put, they are great for the gym when your running on the treadmill. The sound is clear and not uneven. Few set backs are uneven length of the wires, tangling of the wire and they are a bit tight, so I wouldn't leave them in for hours at a time. Other than that, they do the job."
3,Better than most but still can't stand up to sweat.,"I bought a pair of these about 6 months ago and used them multiple times a week. They fit great and have a clip that holds them secure to your clothes. Although the cord is a little long for my arm band, they still worked better than almost all headphones I tried. That is, until a few weeks ago. They completely stopped working. No sound. I took the plastic ear covers off and noticed the speakers had rusted completely. This is upsetting b/c these headphones are marketed at being waterproof and yet, after 6 months, they have already rusted through. I wouldn't be upset under normal circumstances (headphones are cheap and usually break or fall apart rather quickly) but these are $40. For this much, they certainly should last longer than this."
2,"Good sound, cheap construction","These are made by Sennheiser, so expect great sound quality, especially for in-ear buds.However, where these lack is in construction. There are so many little parts to these headphones that you invariably lose pieces. The rubber on the ear phones are customizable so they fit to your ear. They also fall out and get lost easily; currently, I have two differing sizes between the two ears because I've lost the right sized ones. The little plastic extrusion that juts off the top also has a rubber piece that is easily lost.Bottom line, these headphones are probably great if you never move them (say, only use at desk). But if you're like me an work out with them, use them for commute, there is little doubt that the headphone you have in two months won't be the one you have today."
3,One Fatal Flaw,"The green ear pads come off very easily when going in and out of pockets and gym bags. I wonder if this isn't by design.Either way, it sucks, because you end up having to buy more pads, and you can't just buy the ones you like, but the whole set."
1,Poor fit,"I gave these a try because of the innovation with twist-to-fit, reasonable price and the different sizes of silicone covers included. I must have small ear openings because I can't get these to stay in my ear with any of the different fittings. I'd also say the cord is very thin and easily susceptible to entanglement."
2,"Well built, but just don't fit","I bought these earphones because of their reputation for quality and the ability to stay in your ears during exercise. Sennheiser delivers on the quality side; the MX75s appear well built and solidly assembled. The sound is above average, too. But these things just won't go into my ears. The cheap phones that came with my iPod fit better. And there are no instructions on how to use the ""twist lock"" system other than one small picture on the packaging with a couple of arrows indicating ... well, something. Another gripe is that the cord seems to go out of its way to curl and tangle on itself, more so than normal cords.I expected a better fit and got a worse fit. I returned these for a refund."
2,A little delicate,"Initially I really liked these headphones. They have a few different stopper sizers for the buds, to try to fit in your ears, and one set seemed to work well for me. However, the wire casing started cracking in a few places after a few months of regular use, and finally, right at the plug. They lasted less than a year."
2,Probably better for larger ears.,These didn't fit my ears well and the sound quality is nothing to write home about. I run so I like to have loud music with substantial bass to push me along.
3,Not for small ears!,"I bought these headphones so I could workout and not worry about my Apple earbuds falling out. Unfortunately I have small ears and these are just way to big to ever be comfortable. I tried to put them in like an earplug but the actual speaker part is just too large. Plus they really bother my piercings.I gave it three stars because it is a really good design, would totally work if I had bigger ears, it's lime green (which is awesome!), and I was able to use the foam covers for my apple earbuds and they stay in pretty well now.Just too much hassle to return, will probably give them to my boyfriend."
2,"didn't work for me -- fit, sound, or comfort","I couldn't figure this thing out...I twisted forward, I twisted backward...it never felt snug, and kept falling out. Granted, I never used all the extra ear-sizing accessories, but sheesh who has the time. You really got to dig this into your ear to hear any sound or turn it up real loud. The abnormally long right side length was odd too. I tried rearranging this many different ways and the extra cord just curled around my neck - it was quite distracting."
2,Not as good as the name suggests.,"I bought these because according to the specs they should have been pretty good. I have also had full size headphones from Sennheiser and they were amazing.These headphones sound very bright. Lot's of highs and mids. This is fine, but they are lacking in the bass department. Not only that, they do try to reproduce the bass but distort it. So when you turn the volume up a little and it's a bassy song, it sounds like you're listening to a bad recording.They do fit my ear fine, quite well actually, it obviously depends from person to person how they fit. Unfortunately this doesn't make the sound any better.All in all I'm disappointed and they will end up in a drawer somewhere. My search for a good sounding affordable in-ear-phone continues..."
4,MX75 is pretty good,"The headphones live up to the billing, as far as staying in your ears. Far superior to the ones my iPod came with, or the Apple earbuds. The one drawback to the MX75 is that the various adjustable rubber disks, which are used to fine tune the earbuds to the size and shape of your ear, tend to come off of the headphones and get lost. I've already lost both of the spongey disks for the actual speakers, and now have to use the rubber rings instead."
1,Disappointeed...,"This was one of my worst purchases of 2006. The ""Twist-To-Fit In-Ear"" technology doesn't work and I kept having to pause my running to adjust the headphones. I eventually gave up and they're sitting in one of my drawers gathering dust.I wish someone from Sennheiser would contact me and offer a full refund.Very disappointed."
1,not so nice shock,"The first few times I used this earphones, it was great. It is a little tricky getting them in just right (I had to switch to the smallest nubs; maybe it's easier for those with larger ears). Then while on a treadmill run, I felt a little snap in my ear. I didn't think anything of it. Sometimes the satellite reception isn't that great so I changed to another machine. I started running, and there it was again. There was no mistaking it, I was feeling little shocks in my ears. Well that was it for me. I definitely wanted these to work, so I was sad to have to return them. Maybe it was a bad pair, but I won't chance it."
3,good but ehhh,good ear phones...i just hate the long chord...plus that volume control at the middle of the chord is not the business...good stuff just not for me.
3,The Wheels Come Off,Nice headphones. But the purpose of those odd little wheels on top of the ear pieces eludes me. I twisted them off with a pair of pliers. Added benefit: Now the set ACTUALLY fits into the shiny but not very practical carrying case.
4,nice earphones,"I like these earphones, they have a bit more bass than my apple earphones, as far as running goes. for just walking around the apple earphones are pretty hard to beat for under a hundred bucks. I am happy with these and will continue to wear them. the accessories that come with tem take a few times to find the right fit but once found it is all good."
3,MX 55 or MX 75,"why does Amazon lump the reviews for these two very different products together? Has anybody but me noticed that the photo illustrating the MX 55 phones does not at all resemble what they actually look like? Mine are this cheesy looking pseudo chrome, including the case. The photo shows them to be white/black and charcoal. They are not. The sound is ok. Can't figure out how they should be screwed into my ears but they seem to stay there pretty well anyway. B - for headphone quality to Sennheiser, F to Amazon for trying to pull a fast one."
5,"Good fit, best price","Can't comment on music listening quality, only do Audible books with an MP3 Creative V100. These lasted almost two years of rough treatment. Agree with reviewer who complained about rubber rings coming off, was often searching the bedsheets for missing pieces, they pop right back on. Love the in-line volume control and the ""twist to fit"". Just ordered my second pair - best value for the price."
2,"Average sound, substandard construction.","The sound is 'okay' for a cheap pair of headphones but not stellar. No matter what I do, I can't get a decent comfortable 'fit' with their design. After a couple months, my pair started falling apart (the bud covering, silver plastic piece on the back fell off and won't stay on). I guess you get what you pay for so I shouldn't complain too much. But I wouldn't recommend these."
3,decent earphones....but not enough volume,"I basically wanted a pair that would not fall out when I run on the treadmill. I thought since it is a Sennheiser, the sound quality would be good too. It does serve its purpose of not falling out AT ALL...but the pads cause pain after an hour or so. The volume is not enough. The bass is decent, nothing to talk about.The wires for some reason keep getting wound up and become tangled VERY easily."
5,Great headphones for exercising,"I bought these after trying several other styles and brands of headphones for running, and the rest either fell out of my ears or were extremely uncomfortable. These really do stay in your ear no matter how sweaty you get. I really had no trouble finding the right attachments to make them fit my ear - took about 3 minutes. They are a bit strange with the asymmetrical cord, but it just goes behind the head. The cord does curl up, however the alligator clip keeps it in place so it's not tugging on your ears. The case that it comes with also holds my iPod shuffle so it's all in one place. I'm very happy with my purchase. Well worth the price"
3,Sennheiser Earbuds,The ear buds have different lengths of cords and the left ear falls out when I turn my head. It's too short. The right one is just as long as the plug in portion. I haven't figured out yet how to adjust the lengths. Other than that overall they stay in my ears better than the originals. I wouldn't buy them again.
3,Sport?,"They do stay put once you figure out how to insert them. Unfortunately, sweat caused the cord to disintegrate. For an earbud supposedly designed for exercise, this is unacceptable."
3,They Pass,"I like them as they serve their purpose I bought them for, and that is to stay in my ear while I excercise. They do hurt my ear and sometimes make my ear itch a bit as I sweat. The sound is pretty good. The fact that I do not have to constantly worry that they will fall out is a great plus."
2,Good for work out,I bought this because I want a pair for work out.Later I found out it is really not comfortable to wear it since the little thing keeps stretching my ears.The soound quality is soso. I did compared it with my ipod ear buds. I found out that this pair has even worse performance comparing to those ipod ear phones.
3,Its alright,I thought it was going to be black. turned out to be deep blue. the twist-n-fit part is a little uncomfortable. could have been smaller. but nice sound nonetheless.
1,Ouchiiieeeee,These either fall out of my ears or kill my ears in pain after a very short time of running..
4,Great for Jogging,"These buds stay in place really well during a long jog. The sound quality isn't a good as the Sennheiser Noise Canceling ear buds, but if you're only planning to use these for high impact workouts, they're the right tool for the job. My only complaint is that the cord is very prone to tangling."
1,Sennheiser MX 55 earphones,"The quality of the product is fine but the padding around the earbuds and the supporting padding areas are the worst. I lose the padding on a consistent basis. The casing is an exercise of design over function. In order to put the ear phones back in the case, if takes a minute or two."
2,not quite there,"They sound good and fit tight, but I can't get the wire to straighten out. It's always coiled - won't lay flat. If Sennheiser could combine these earpieces with Apple's earbud wire, they'd have a real winner."
3,'Mediocre Device',"Overall the earphones are satisfactory. However, the acoustics are limited, the basic apple phones are even better than the Sennheiser's. One reason to buy them was the incentive of a mail-in rebate. After having sent them the pertaining code bar etc. they refused to send a check because of 'wrong documentation'which is absolutely bogus since I had sent everything correctly. I won't fall for this again."
3,Careful if you have small ears,"The sound quality is good on this product and they do somewhat stay in place, but not as well as the product claims. I have small ears, and the earbud peice is actually larger than most standard headphones (think ipod), so they really don't go into your ear canal; they sit on the outside. The savings grace is the material the earbuds are made out of. Not as slippery as ipod headphones, but definetly doesn't keep them in during an energetic workout. I usually have to adjust them 5-7 times, this is an improvement over my ipod headphones."
4,They're Great for Athletics,"These are meant for athletes, and with that in mind, they're great. They really are very comfortable, especially when you attach the properly-sized adapters (which are included). They feel very secure and I'm confident that they won't fall out.No, the audio quality is not the best. I compared them to Apple's new in-ear headphones (which, by the way, are AMAZING in terms of audio quality), and the Sennheiser's bass response is noticeably weak. But the point is that Apple's headphones -- while I love them -- are awful to go jogging with.Again, these are made for athletics, and in that regard they perform wonderfully. Also, the carrying case is cool."
2,"Great concept, bad construction.","My pair fell apart after a few months of use. The ear pads and green bands come off easily and so easily lost in any gym bag. Although they come with different sized bands, there are no replacement bands. So if the original bands were the right size, you're out of luck."
1,What a waste!!,A complete waste of money!! The earpieces didn't fit in my ears and ouldn't stay in place no matter what I did. I threw them away.
2,"Decent functionality, horrible quality","I bought these earphones in July 2008 to use while cycling. I had tried several cheap headphones, and they died with 6 months. A higher quality earphone should last longer and perform better, I had thought. I have now had these earphones 3 months, and they are now completely dead. After month 1, the left earphone had ripped out of the cord when slightly snagged on my messenger bar. After 2 months, the rubber gasket and earphone cover had fallen off the remaining right earphone. By month 3, the right earphone had pulled out of the housing and would dangle loose. All of this happened just be using the headphones while road cycling. Road cycling is a fairly benign activity, and these earphones failed spectacularly. The sound quality was great for the month that both earphones worked, and that is the reason for the 2 stars. If they stay in piece, they do work fairly well."
2,Poor ergonomics,"The earphone buds are too large and consequently cause pain after about 15 minutes, even when using the smaller fitting ring. The twist-to-fit is okayish, though it causes pain after a while, as the length of the twist-to-fit portion is fixed and may not match with your ear.NOT recommended unless you have really large ears. May sound stupid, but that's the way it is.Sound quality is good. But you dont care about sound quality if your ears hurt."
3,"Good sound, not good fit","The quality of sound from these headphones is excellent for the price. Bass tones, synthesizers, and drums all are clear and true, unlike many headphones. To help the ear buds stay in, these headphones have an extension that pushes against the ear. Even with the smallest covers for the extension, they don't fit right and cause me pain. They're tolerable for a 30 minute gym workout, but not good for long runs."
4,Good Headphones for the Purpose,"I ordered these headphones after searching many different styles. I needed some to stay in my ears for running. These work great! Neon green, who cares as long as they stay in. The thing I like most about them is you don't have to jam them into your ear canal to get them to stay. The twist to fit locks them in without the discomfort and I like the clip for the cord. The sound quality is much better than headphones that come with the ipod and more than good enough to listen to my favorite tracks while working out. Why they decided to make one side of the cord longer than the other, I cannot tell you but if you hang it behind your neck it works just fine.If you want headphones to stay in your (ears without the jam) with good sound quality, get these...unless you really, really, hate green."
2,All ears are different,"Seemed like a smart design... until I tried it in MY ears. This is the risk of purchasing something you cannot try before you buy. I found the headphones just couldnt sit comfortably in my ears for more than about 20 minutes, albeit a ""smart"" design that apparently stays firmly in place better than others - I took them out after a short while reverting to my older ""in ear"" soft type. I'd recommend buyers just be sure they know their ear - which can only be after trying out a few designs, and losing some - then looking at finer features like sound quality etc."
4,stay in place earbuds,"these buds do what they claim though they are not the most comfortable. I also would like the a slightly longer cord. the plastic trim is a bit flimsy and I had to glue a piece back on already.in the main, I'm satisfied with the sound and with the ability of the buds to stay put in my ears while very active.amazon's delivery very good as well."
3,Hurts so good,"These live up to their billing: they stay in your ears. Unfortunately, they HURT. You can move them around a bit and kinda balance them on the edge of falling out to reduce the discomfort but it would be nice if someone would invent ear buds that stay in the ears without pain. Still, I prefer these to all others I've tried that fall out when I move my head. I listen to audiobooks and the sound quality of these is fine for this purpose. I doubt any ear buds deliver great sound. I'd buy these again because I will put up with some discomfort to ensure the buds stay put."
1,ouch!,"I have used these headphones for over a week now, and I must say, they HURT!! There are only a few ways they fit in my ears, and none of them are comfortable, which is a disappointment because the sound quality is excellent."
4,Serves its purpose - stays in during my run,"These stay secure while running where others have failed. That said I seem to have relatively small ears (for a guy) and even on the smallest fitting its still a bit tight. Though a little uncomfortable, I eventually forget they're there.The sound is lower middle of the pack ( but definitely better then the Sony MDR-J10 which also have the problem of bouncing a little on a run). If your just sitting at a desk or other otherwise not bouncing around, I recommend the Koss KSC75 - not an ear bud, but cheap and great sound for the price. The Koss's just aren't for heavy activity."
3,just about the left cord being shorter than the right,"Everyone seems to be concerned about why the heck the left cord is shorter. I actually don't own these headphones, but the Sony fontopia buds I have do the same thing. I personally love it once I found out why---when you use them you can put the cord behind your head instead of having it dangle in front of you while you run (thus it keeps them out of the way but still off to the side for easy access when taking off). I love this! Once I flipped it over during a run and it just takes out that extra annoyance of having the dangling cord. So there ya go."
3,"good, but not for me","All in all, these do work well but only for the right people. I got them for myself when I run, but they do not stay in my ear at all. They worked well with other people I found though. I have large ears I guess. lolWould be 5 stars if I got them as a gift. Seeing how I got them for myself, I'm gonna say 1 star."
5,varma,The headphones are very nice to see and feel and not that best in sound quality. I am very happy with this purchase(for this price) and it comes with a beautiful carry case. This ear phones fit perfectly in my ears and are very comfortable.
4,Satisfied,"This is the best inexpensive pair of ear buds I've tried. They are, as advertised, very secure although they get uncomfortable over time. I wear mine for about 5-6 hours at a time. The sound quality is very good for the price. They do have to be positioned just right to get the proper sound quality. This means insert a twist, thus they get uncomfortable after a couple hours."
4,"Fits nice, sounds clear, good value.","It took a bit of practice to get the ""twist-in"" action going, but once in, it's not getting loose or falling out. These headphones came with what you'd expect (replacement ear piece, clip for your shirt, etc.) and a surprise accessory. Overall, it's a pretty good value especially if you're athlete. The green is a great separator if you're trying to find it in your clutter!The only down-side is it doesn't quite produce a big low bass sounds if you're looking for that beat to keep you going."
4,Fantastic Headphones,"Second pair of these ... which is why they get 4/5. One ear bud fell apart after about 7 months but they are worth a second shot.Fantastic for true sports training ... I ride (cycle) with these and place only one bud in my right ear; love the alligator clip to keep line close to my jersey. Wonderful for running with the longer side to wrap 'round to the back and stay out of the way, especially when doing hills, etc.Quality sound so ya just gotta get over the color ... who cares? Especially if you are using these for training ... might make you go faster if you don't want to be seen with them on. Maybe Sennheiser will make a nice simple gray color. As far as the extra cord length, keep it coiled and use the twisty that comes with the package. Works nicely.I found if I twist the bud properly, they don't hurt my ear after long usage ... but that was a bit of trial and error and then reading these reviews! Thanks."
4,solid headphones,"good headphones. my only problem was the rubber pieces that your supposed to ""twist to fit in"" fall out very easily. sometimes when i take the headphones out of my pocket it has fallen off of the headphones and i find it in my pocket. they have extra ones but so far i have lost 3 of them."
4,Very nice headphones,"I just received my MX55V and I am impressed. The twist to fit system creates a nice snug fit. The sound is great. While working out, one side loosens up a bit, but not to bad. Overall a good value."
4,Great earphones for working out,"These earphones are great for what they are intended to be used for, working out. I would rate the sound quality as very good, not great, and not quite what I would expect for Sennheiser. That being said, I would still reccommend these to anyone looking for something that will stay put while working out, even while running.They do take a second to get in your ear at first, and I probably wouldn't recommend them to anyone with somewhat smaller ears.Bottom line, they are a great product, they will stay in place, they hold up well to abuse (bouncing around, sweat, etc.), and they sound very good."
4,Earphones that finally fit!,"I have never had pair of earbud headphones that were comfortable and actually stayed in place - until I bought these Sennheisers! I no longer have to adjust my headphones every 2 minutes at the gym or while running. While sticking anything in your ear will hurt after awhile, these are the most comfortable ones I've tried. My only minor complaint is that the flexible carrying case doesn't seem like it would protect the headphones all that well, but overall I am thrilled with these headphones!"
3,great fit... secure... but heavy on the bass...,they stay secure... they have no clip to secure cord to your shirt...sound is a bit heavy on the bassy side... high range is a little lacking...volume slider control on the cord is convient...
4,"Great sound, just OK for comfort","I bought these sport model earphones for my workout in the gym. They sound great, but I don't think my ears are designed for the twist-to-fit feature. I tried all the sizes of the adaptors that came with it without success. However, they do stay in even through strenuous workouts and don't seem affected by sweat. They tend to hurt a little bit after more than an hour of wear for me."
4,"good sound, but","Good sound, they stick in pretty good, but they don't block out external noise very well. The other in the ear Sennheisers are a better choice for that. These do stay in pretty well, much better than the standard iPod earphones."
2,Too big,"I got these ear buds because others that I have tried don't stay in. The problem with these however, is that they're way too big for my ears. the bud itself is too big so I can't even get that part in my ear let alone the extended ""twist-to-fit"" pad. I had high hopes for these buds but I guess I'll have to keep searching for a small pair."
3,perfect fit,The Sennheiser MX55 Twist-To-Fit In-Ear Stereo Headphones are perfect for my hard to fit ears. The only draw back is the long thin connecting wire that hangs like a plate of pasta from my ears.
4,So far so good,"After several months, I'm still enjoying the good sound of these earphones. The color is irrelevant. They fit very comfortably in my ears. However, I still don't get how to wear the long cord. Any ideas?"
1,No Durability,"After several months of use I am giving up on using these headphones. I have used the headphones during running and when the headphones get wet from sweating they stop working. Eventhough I try to dry them, the headphones stop working after few minutes again.My advise is that these headphones can not be used for sports eventhough they are marketed as sport headphones"
1,Poor cover material,"Like many of these reviewers, I too liked the sound and the fit but the casing started to pull away from the wiring. I thought I had accidentally cut the cord but it started coming apart in several locations. Once I saw other reviewers with the same issue, it has come to my attention that these aren't as rugged as they claim."
2,Unusual design,"I twisted and twisted, but they never quite fit. They either hurt or fell out (or both).Then the rubber ""foot"" popped off one of the buds and disappeared and that was that.Nice sound quality though."
4,Great for running,"I received this as a gift, and my only use is to listen to music while running. I've used them several times and they are the best ear buds I've ever had for running. They stay in the ear even with aggressive running, and are not uncomfortable. I would recommend these for any activity."
4,Incredible sound. Fell apart within 2 weeks.,"I was extremely disappointed. These are incredible sounding phones, but, they fell apart, and stopped working within 2-3 weeks. Now, to be fair, I kept them in my pocket, but they should be sturdier. Piece by piece they would disappear, until it was metal on ear, then the metal mesh fell off. Too bad, they sound incredible. Perhaps if you baby them, really baby them, they will last. If you are rough on stuff like me, steer clear."
4,HEADPHONES,"FIRST TO GET A REVIEW YOU SHOULD NOT HAVE YOUR CUSTOMERS GO THROUGH SO MANY STEPS IT IS A WASTE OF MY TIME. NOW FOR MY REVIEW, THE HEADPHONES GIVE GOOD SOUND FIT COMFORTABLY BUT REQUIRE A LEARNING CURVE TO FIT IN THE EAR"
4,Love Them!,"I purchased these about 2 months ago in hopes of not having to replace yet another set of earphones because of sweating. I love them! The twist to fit feature is great. They just don't move. I find the sound quality to be just fine and frankly the color just doesn't phase me. Yeah, I might have preferred them in black but in the end, function is much more important to me. My only gripe is that the one side is so much longer than the other. I understand why, but for me I would just prefer them to be the same length. And frankly if that's my only complaint I can live with it. I highly recommend these to all my running friends because they stay put and with all the sweating they have not shorted out. Buy them!"
1,Disappointing,"The experience you get with these earphones will depend a lot on the anatomy of your ear lobes. My experience was very disappointing. The fit was uncomfortable and the sound was quiet and tinny. Swapping between the supplied rubber parts did nothing to improve the fit or the sound. I am considering returning the MX55s, but for the price I wonder if it is worth the effort."
2,Great sound - a little scary,"I purchased this product to listen to music / watch videos while on my bicycle trainer. My setup requires me to plug it at the back of my computerThe sound is great and the retention mechanism works as advertised.The length of the cable is a little on the short side, but that may depend a lot on the use you plan for your product. More importantly, after working a good sweat I am sorry to report I got shocked. The headphones started buzzing and I felt a minor, but very clear, electric shock. Needless to say, the headphones went flying and have not been used since. People might point out that the likely culprit is my computer, not the headphones. All I can tell you is that the experience was a little scary."
5,The best earphones!,These earphones were purchased for my son who is a runner. These are the best earphones he has ever used for running and otherwise. I read about them in running magazines and they were highly recommended and have been fabulous! I would not buy anything else.
2,Dissapointing,"I personally don't care for these as they1: Hurt my ears no matter what combo I use of adapters2: Don't sound very clear unless I hold them into my ear3: Have a crappy case and cord design that will not straighten out4: Are cheaply designed.I bought 2 pairs as I figured I couldn't go wrong with the name. Oh well, I'll just try and return them, but for 12 a pair it's not really worth the hassle.These stay in my ear really well but they hurt and don't sound nearly as nice as my cheap skull candy's"
2,not so hot.,"I am constantly on the lookout for the ultimate earphones....ones that will stay in for 20 miles of running. I had hopes for these, however I am still looking. Good concept however reality is that the little gaurds come off in the middle of a run when sweat loosens the fit. trying to put them back in is when the top guards come off if you are not careful."
1,I HATE the Coiled Cable,"The sound coming from these headphones is great, and so is the twist to fit method of keeping the buds in your ears. But the cable is absulutely the worst one I've ever seen. I guess the coiled cable idea is ok in theory, but uncoiling the cable every time I use them is awful. Every time I put them in it takes at least a minute of untangling the cable to be able to use them. And I don't understand at all why the left cable (about 12-15"") is so much shorter than the right (about 30""). The left cable is so short that the left ear bud keeps jerking at the shirt clip, which means I have to adjust them several times to stop the jerking. Except for the earbud, the iPod approach to the cable is MUCH, MUCH better."
1,Didn't work for me,The twist to fit concept intrigued me. Thought it was the answer to my problems in a decent fitting headphone for my ears. I thought wrong. If you have ears of size you feel is a little different don't buy these. Couldn't tell you about the sound quality. Since they didn't fit properly I sent them right back.
4,"Great Stay-on Earbuds, Terrible Cord Tangles","I've had these earbuds for a few months now and they are much better than the standard iPod earbuds for 1) audio quality 2) staying in the ear for workouts an all around use 3) overall comfort. However, the cord provides you with the mother of all tangles. The extra long right earbud cord is very annoying. Yes, it allows you to position the right earbud cord Behind your neck and allows you to clip the main cord to your left to keep it out of the way. However, when stored, you don't have that iPod cord slide to keep the cord untangled. It takes special care to keep the cord untangled (a lost cause most of the time). The green ear fittings also fall off. I'm going to superglue my fittings on as I've used up my last spare."
4,Earbuds that finally stay in!,"Let me preface this review by saying I'm not an audio expert. But I'm an outdoor runner who's tried different brands of headphones (cheap and not-so-cheap) and am pleased to say that I've finally found earbuds that do fit comfortably & securely. The wires don't bother me as I just run them down the back of my shirt. Nor am I nit-picky about the sound -- as far as I'm concerned, the quality is fine. These are kinda pricey but worth it, in my opinion, if - like me - you've had trouble finding earbuds that fit!"
4,Great Sound. Questionable Design.,The sound is great. Ear fit is perfect (and adjustable). No slippage during hard runs. Durable. Design is a bit weird. After wire splits to earbuds one side is longer. Kind of makes it a pain and you can only use and armband on one side because of it. Also the wire is too curly. It literally takes forever to straighten out. Mine still isn't straight and I've had the headphones for 2 months. If you are more concerned with sound quality and slippage then these are for you. If logistics around the body are a priority another pair is probably your best option.
2,Didn't live up to expectations,"I have another pair of Sennheisers (PX100) and I love them. Wear them all day at work. I wanted another pair for the gym and bought these even though they're super-green. The worst part is the curly cable that keeps getting tangled. So annoying. None of the adapters made them fit my ear, and after 30 min they start to hurt. Sound quality was okay, but not as good as my other pair. Overall, I'm not that impressed and wouldn't recommend them."
2,"Don't confuse ""Twist-to-fit"" with ""One size fits all""","Maybe I have freakish ears or something, but these headphones popped out of my ears during a run just like every other pair. The sound quality is okay, I must say I have heard better from Sennheiser. All in all pretty disappointed in these earphones. So the hunt for the perfect pair of headphones continues once again ..."
2,Underwhelming: Save your $$,"I don't get the positive reviews. I've had my MX75s for several months and find them to be merely adequate. In other words, they really aren't an improvement over the ear buds which came with my iPod Nano. They don't fit my ears or stay put any better--irrespective of which of the included silicon sizing rings I use; they don't sound radically better than the original ear buds; and the cord/wire is too stiff and is sometimes awkward as a result. My recommendation is to either stay with your original ear buds or spend a bit more to get something with a greater WOW! factor."
5,Original Design - Superb Performance,"This headphone fits a normal-sized ear well. It remains secure throughout my workout and provides great audio. I would not recommend this for smaller ears, but for those who are running and need a headphone that will stay in place, I highly recommend this model. It comes with adjustable pieces that allow you to customize this product for you ear. Very easy to put in and remove. The sound quality is the best that I have found in a sweat-resistent headphone. Great product and top-quality sound."
4,"Still not perfect, but by far the best I've found","I am a very petite woman and I wanted some new headphones that would stay in my ears comfortably for running. After buying and returning at least five different headphones, these are the ones I settled on. The design is great and they come with different sized attachments so you can fit the twisty part perfectly to your earfold. The sound quality and intensity are fine with me and they're comfortable too. The only complaint I have is that the earbuds are still a little big for my ears- they haven't fallen out, but sometimes they feel like they will. I ended up taking the green ring off of the earbuds to make them smaller."
4,"Good for workouts, a few minor issues","As designed for, these headphones are great for staying secure through the rigors of a run, at the gym, or whatever. Sound quality seems nice and crisp, though I'm no audiophile. Comes with a lot of nice extras, including a good carrying case, cord clip and a variety of interchangeable pieces to customize the fit of the earphones.Small gripes: No matter the combination of adjustments I make, the earphones don't seem to fit my ears quite right, and over time they cause my ears to ache a bit. Who knows, maybe I have freakish ears. The sound is noticeably quieter coming through these earphones versus the standard phones that came with my Sansa MP3 player. The cord seems to have a lot of memory, so I can't seem to get the coils out of it and thus it tends to get in my way at the gym.They're great for what I got them for. Running, hitting the gym. They stay put and seem impervious to sweat (which I make a lot of), rain, etc."
4,"Basically awesome, but keep in case because pads will fall off","I love, love, love these headphones. I've worn them for 3-hours runs in the rain without having to readjust-- They stay in place practically forever and do not make your ears sore at all. The larger rings that go around the speaker portion act as great shock absorbers (as they all do), and also keep rain/sweat from getting into the ear and speaker itself.The only reason I gave them 4 stars rather than 5 is because I've lost a few of the smaller rubber pads that rest in the upper part of your ear. Probably my fault for throwing them into my bottomless pit of a purse without a case or anything-- Luckily they come with 3 different sized sets, and they all work great for me!"
4,They stick like they're glued in!,"I burned through about 4 pairs of earbuds before coming across the MX75s. I was tired of having my headphones dropping out on the floor after about 5 minutes into my work out because of the copious amount of sweat I can produce. After placing the earpads that come with these 'phones to custom fit my ears, I can state that I haven't had any problems with these staying put during my vigorous workouts. Sound quality is good and I experienced no adjustment period pain that you associate with using new headphones. Only issues: Neon green looks fugly and there's a split developing in the cord at the jack's base, but that's because I didn't use the case that's included. These are headphones made to order for gym rats!"
5,all around nice,"The ear buds feel right when running, they have an assortment of sizes which is also nice; however, the cord is pre-formed to retake its curved shape....so it breaks easily. meaning, when you are done with the product, and putting it back in it's case, the cord has a good chance that it will split and tangle. Amazing sound though out-weighs some cosmetic features."
1,Volume controller hardly works!!,"I bought these because I wanted a volume controller on the headset so I wouldn't have to bother fooling around with the controls on my ipod touch, which can be a real pain. Well, the volume controls on this this unit are useless. They have a really short range. So you can't turn the volume all the way down (in case you need to speak with someone or listen to what's going on around you) So you need to pull the damn ear pieces out of your ear or use the controls on your ipod or whatever mp3 player you're using - so why bother having a volume control."
1,"OK, but nothing to get excited about","This is the third set of Sennheiser headphones I have purchased and I have been disappointed in all three. I don't even know where the Twist- to-fit set is now. I used them the first day and I just don't see where all the excitement about them comes from. You can twist all you want but the things still won't stay in your ears. The last set of fit-in-your-ear type I bought were so large you would need ears as large as a jackass to put them in. They were Wayyyy toooo big for my ears, and people say I have large ears. The sound quaslity of all three is no better than much less expensive headphones. Anyone have suggestions on other brands to try?"
2,Good Until They Shock You!,"I purchased these back in October because they were on Sale and I figured I'd give them a try for day-to-day use while commuting. While I must say for in-ear headphones they're great and stay in, they also shock me. Recently, I the headphones have been shocking me almost every time I wear them. Obviously they will be meeting the trash soon."
2,Work great until they completely fell apart after 5 months,there were great until they completely fell apart after 5 months. every piece on the earbud fell off until i had to just throw them away. least durable product ever. may try the other pair that is similar w/replacement parts included. VERY disappointed for the price point.
2,did not work for me,"I purchased these and tried many different configurations; you are give a variety of little pieces yuo can use to customer the ""fit: to your ear. Bottom Line: the did not fit any better or worse than any other ear buds that I have owned."
4,Sennheiser MX75,"Yes, these are a lil' strange. In fact, my ears are so small, they still hurt when I wear them. Normally I think your ears would get used to them. The sound is good, i have yet to wear them working out, but other than that they're great!"
1,What crappy headphones,"I was initially skeptical about the ""twist to fit"" thing. Then I decided that I would just throw down the cash and get some of these, wow, that was a bad idea. An even worse idea was for this company to design such a gimmicky piece of crap. Do not buy these very uncomfortable headphones."
4,Walkman headphones,Excellent sound comes through using my Walkman. Comfortable fit. Excellent service from Amazon. Would buy more products by this company.
2,"good sound, bad design","first I will say the good parts: the sound is good, they stay in your earsNow the bad: first off, i HATE the cord. I am ok with the asymmetrical part, but it is so goddam coiled its extremely irritating and difficult. Secondly, I don't know if it's just me, but it takes a while to get these in correctly. I have to adjust them multiple times to do it right and its much more hassle than I want to deal with . Overall the hassle of the cord and getting the earphones in correctly pissed me off too much so I returned them. (Btw I just got some Skullkandy smokin buds and I like those so far)"
3,Not Bad,"These are not bad for the price I paid,$17.00,with nice sound. I did find them uncomfortable and difficult to keep in my ears. At the current price of $12.00 they are a steal as long as you don't have small ear canals."
4,Fantastic earphones!,"These show how good mp3 can be. The fidelity is as good as could possibly be expected in any head/earphones for less than $100. And for $15? Wow.I have a feeling all the fitting pads they give you are overkill unless you have some of Dumbo's genes. The twist-to-fit concept is great for those of us who don't like sticking things into their ear canals and leaving them there for hours at a time. The only disappointing thing I can find is that the wire is awfully light weight, but at this price it's probably worth stocking up on them for when the inevitable occurs."
2,"Great sound, secure in the ear, but adaptors fall off easily","I bought these headphones for workouts (running, sports, the gym). The twist feature does secure the buds in your ear well. The sound is very good with surprisingly good bass response. The big negative is that the earbud adaptors come free from the earphone and are easily lost. I have only had my headphones for a few weeks and already three adaptors have come loose and two of those were lost. The adaptors are required for these headphones to fit comfortably in the ear, so I can't recommend these headphones overall."
2,Just don't sweat,"I tried my best to like this headphones but I couldn't. From the first time I used them it was painful, but the pain dissipated after I started working out ... or so I thought. When I took them off, my ears remained painfully sore. I continued to use them nonetheless, why I don't know, but think it's because the maintain a sturdy fit. But still the sound quality was just okay as they had a hard time handling low notes. But I decided I'd had enough when I realized that sweat ruins the friction fit, and they consistently slid out of my ears during my long runs. I'm going back to my behind the neck headphones, that are clunky but sound great and stay on my ears."
1,Don't buy if your ears are on the small side,"I have tried these at least 5 times and I'm done. My ears are smallish (not freakishly, I am a girl) I even put the smallest attachments on, but by the end of my workout my ears are throbbing and somewhat numb. I kept giving them a chance trying different positions because I really wanted to like these. Because my ears are smallish regular buds fall out of my ears it's is SO frustrating. If you have suggestions for sport earbuds that work well with small ears please feel free to 'comment' your suggestion."
4,Excellent Choice for Earbuds that Stay in Place,"My iPod earbuds slip out of my ears when I walk/run, so I tried the Coby isolation earbuds, Sony MDR-J10 Clip-on Style Stereo Headphones, and Panasonic MDR-J10 Clip-on Style Stereo Headphones, as well as others, to no avail. Finally, I've found earphones that stay in place when I walk/run. The sound quality is better than the Coby, Sony, and Panasonic ones I've mentioned, so that's yet another plus for these. So far they've held up through marathon training for this year."
4,Great for running,"I have tried numerous sport headphones and always found them fine for the gym, but lacking for running. These headphones are great for running. They don't have loops over the ears to interfere with sunglasses and they don't slide out over the course of a run. The sound is very good for a sport headphone. I highly recommend them over any other headphone for running."
1,Sennheiser MX75 Headphones,"The headphones worked just great, but after only two weeks there is a problem with one of the sides (a crackle in the phone). Now I have to find out how to get a refund. To my knowledge, I did nothing to cause this problem."
2,not crazy about these,The sound is good but the fit is very funky. I cannot figure out the twist to fit system. There is no illustartion in the package or at the Sennheiser website. I passed these around my office and asked a bunch of tech geeks if they could figure out how to fit them properly into my ears and no one could. My ears are pretty average looking too. Also - the cord is about 7 feet long. This is absurd! I have had to gerry-rig it up with twist ties so it doesn't hang down between my feet and trip me when I am running.Also - that green color is super ugly.
3,Sennheiser mx75 Headphones,Very bright color i love it. The issue is that your ear hurts after sometime and then you have to adjust to a different position but then you don't get the whump of the volume so you bring it back. So back and forth. If position right the sound quality is pretty good. Little case is not a bad idea to keep them after use. I have bought two of them for myself and my wife.
3,well ... they work,"When will I learn ...I have bad luck with headphones and these did nothing to convince me otherwise ...I bought these and another pair from Sennheiser, both of them stink! They just don't fit well. The 'twist to fit' thing is interesting, but they don't stay in firmly. I prefer earbuds, but apparently it's impossible to make an earbud speaker that's sweat-proof. I only use my headphones when I'm working out, but that's 6 days a week for at least an hour at a time ... Problem is, I am also an employee at the gym and I need to hear the music well (and nothing else) so I can, if needed, ignore others while I get MY workout in ... these headphones don't do the trick ... even with the player turned all the way up ...I've gotten side tracked ... My review: if you're sitting still, these'll work ..."
2,Pooped-out at six months,"All was well with these headphones for the first six months, but suddenly the right channel is buzzing and I need to replace them. Too bad, because hitherto the sound's been good, and the fit comfortable."
1,Don't bother buying has problems with no fixes,"Don't waste your money on this product. Has few problems with no fixes. Had this unit for 4 months and wireless is tempermental, keep getting ""cannot find printer message"" often on all pc's when trying to print and need to power up/down the unit and or PC's. The pc's are located in same room or a few feet away. WPA encryption does not work at all although it says on specs and package that it is WPA compatible. Motorola knows about the problem but so far 5 -6 months has done nothing to fix, probably don't care till they get a lawsuit."
5,Best Print Server Ever,"Even though its not one of the ""big names"" in wireless networking, this wireless print server works flawlessly. I installed it within 15 minutes on a wired desktop computer and two wireless laptops with a hp laserjet 2200d. After reading other reviews for linksys and d-link etc, i was convinced that none of them worked. I bought this one on sale after rebates, and I was impressed with the ease of install. I highly recommend to anyone who needs a wireless printer located anywhere in your home."
1,False advertising by Motorola--do not buy,"1) Product spec states it supports WPA encryption. I couldn't get it to work so I contacted Motorola tech support by email. The return email stated ""the printserver doesnot support WPA security. (sic)"" Thus, the false advertising claim.2) WPA issues aside, I really couldn't get my printer to work using this printserver."
2,Be careful!,"This printer server may not work with your old parallel port printer. After connecting to my HP Laserjet 4L printer, I can only print some garbage. Called Motorola customer service and talked to a lady who was very impatient and rude. Then talked to a gentleman who claimed to be her supervisor. I was told it might be HP printer issue since this printer server is too fast. The old printer may not be able to handle it.The reason I give it 2 stars is that it works when I connected it to a newer USB printer."
2,Pretty far fetched,"This is my first Judi McCoy book and it will most likely be my last. The set up was great and I enjoyed the first part of it. Then it just goes flat. I didn't feel the chemistry between these two characters. The hero is way too nice. So nice that he's boring. There was no conflict between the two besides the lies they kept from each other. When Zara confesses that she's an alien, it's no big deal...no one even disbelieves it for a second. I got through half the book and then didn't pick it up again for about 4 days. That is not a good sign for me. The epilogue was just a sneak preview for another book I guess. I wanted to know what happened on the spaceship. I guess I'll never find out since I won't pay money for another one of these books."
1,What a lame boring read,"I love sci-fi and read almost any books that come out that are in that genre. This is a stinker. The plot is lame and the story is even lamer. The heroine is from another planet where men can't make any babies and she and 7 other female aliens are sent to Earth to get pregnant by certain males who were picked out by the alien elders. It has all the typical alien subplots with government types trying to capture the alien, etc. It is laughable to think if these aliens can travel throughout the universe what is so special about an Earthman's sperm to help populate their planet. Pass on this one."
3,These are not Vornado brand wicks,"These are not Vornado filters. These are filters that fit Vornado humidifiers. They seem to work fine, but the information presented seems deceptive."
1,Short life span,"These refills are ridiculous. Yes, they are simple to use, but the maximum life span is about two weeks. I've gone through at least 6 sets of refills this winter season already, and the results are consistent. I run the Vornado humidifier 24/7, as recommended by the manufacturer and clean it regularly, especially when changing out the wicks. There is never any gunky build-up to blame the short life-span on. These are clearly manufactured to last only two weeks. My ancient Duracraft, which is no longer manufactured, but is the best humidifier I've ever had, easily goes 4 to 6 weeks between wick filter changes, with no deterioration in performance. This will be the last year I use the Vornado...for next year I'll be purchasing a second Air-o-Swiss, which runs like a dream, but is quite pricey up front."
2,Not a very good product,"These humidifier wicks did not last very long. I do appreciate that there were two sets and the price was right. However, you get what you pay for."
3,cynic,"I understand the benefit of the filters and all, but the cynic in me come out when they recommend running the humidifier constantly and make it difficult not to. Locigal reason - let's make a whole bunch of money selling filters!"
3,Ok but not for me..,"Pretty expensive considering these little paper wicks will last you about 2 months until they start smelling and looking really bad. I recommend opting for a ""wickless"" humidifier. I ended throwing these out along with the humidifier for the new Vick's humidifier which is has the option for a warm or cool setting."
2,Doesn't last very long.,"I suppose it's doing its job, but this replacement wick lasted only a few weeks before getting moldy. I don't know if it has to do with the water or the fact that I have 2 cats, but it seems a little ridiculous to have to replenish the wicks every few weeks. Wish I had known that before purchasing the humidifier."
4,Needed product,This was quick and easy to order. Received it within days and there were no hassles. This time of year it's a neccessay item and I was pleased to with the process.
3,"Useable, but not a Vornado filter","These are definitely not Vornado filters. They are slightly smaller and more cheaply made. They work, but will probably not last very long."
4,satisfied but not so fast,I'm satisfied with this goods. It fits my humidifier. It doesn't smell. It was packed in cardbord. But it took 8 days to arrive.
1,Outdated reviews,"The reviews you show are from 2003 (which is when I bought from you)!. You are currently showing wicks not boxed - which means not regular Vornados. These are substitute wicks - which may be as good and may not be! Also your price for these in 2003 was considerably better, $7.99 per box of 2 versus now 14.99!! Quite a difference. C. Mestrovic"
1,Why Such High Shipping?,I reviewed this item several years ago and commented on the high shipping costs then.Three years later I am still annoyed by the inflated shipping charges that all the Amazon merchants are charging for their filters.Now I order from the Vornado website directly. Each package costs around 12.00 and for 4 packages (8 filters total) I paid $10.00 in combined shipping.
1,Did not fit humidifier and smelled TERRIBLE!!!!,I was bugged at first when these didn't fit very well in my humidifier but I was more upset when they smelled so terrible that it stank up my entire apartment.
3,"Humidifier wicks, they work.","I recently ordered what I believed to be OEM wicks for a Vornado humidifier. What I received was a ""BestAir"" product, #H55-C. There is no mention of that in the listing. They do fit, but not as well as the actual Vornado parts. Not a lot of money, but it's just the point of not getting what I ordered. Also, the H55-C wicks are actually 3 bucks and change cheaper on Amazon that the OEM Vornado parts, but I paid the Vornado price.Update: I contacted the vendor and they took care of the mistake quickly and to my satisfaction. I would order again. This is why I like buying through Amazon, issues are always resolved properly."
1,toxic,"We put these imitation filters in our humidifier, and it instantly stunk up the room with a toxic smell. It was pungent and disgusting, making these filters completely unusable. Honestly, these filters should be tested for safety. I really think that they may be toxic. Avoid!I replaced them with the only slightly more expensive Vornado filters. Smell was gone."
4,As advertised,"Product came quickly, intact and does what is says its going to do - what more can you ask for?"
5,where do you buy humidifier wicks?,"I looked in all the local store websites for 2 days becauseI needed to replace the wicks....Well no luck so I found them on your website,Amazon! the Vornado wicks are not readily availablein any of our local stores in fact,no one carries them!!I was so glad to find them on your site Thank you"
2,Stinky,"Pros:-seem to workCons:-Smell horrific out of the plastic --- need to air outside two days before use, and then run humidifier in garage for 6 hours-Not Vornado-made, different from original filters"
4,Vornado Humidifier Wicks,"These are OEM, and fit and work as they should. I took off one star because they seem too high priced for what they are, but I have steered clear of other suppliers because of poor reviews about fit and filter thickness. We generally get a season out of them, by occasionally washing with a weak bleach solution."
1,Non Genuine Vernado Filters,Buyer beware. These are not as advertised. They are not genuine Vornado MD1-0002 Humidifier Wicks - 2 as advertised. Instead they are a generic. I have not tried them yet so they might be OK. However; I was led to believe buy the description that I was to receive Vornado wicks not a generic marked VFDMD1. This is poor on Amazon's part as well as the actual supplier. I am very disappointed.
1,Smelly & Disgusting,"Thinking I would save a few $$$ instead of buying directly from vorando - I ordered these and learned the lesson of ""you get what you pay for"". After running on my voranado humidifyer for just 1 hour (in COLORADO where it's dry) the musty and mildew smell that was emitted from these filters stay in the house for several more days. I ordered filters from voranado directly and didn't have the issue. Don't bother with these, go direct."
1,ROTTEN FISH!!!,we just put these new filters in and now our living room smells like rotting fish. what the heck???
5,Very Good Service I am not interested in writing 17 words I have already said All I Have to Say,Very Good Service I am not interested in writing 17 words I have already said All I Have to Say
3,Aftermarket product,Non-original product made to look in the advertisement to be OEM.It certainly isn't. I was rather disapointed in this product.
1,Not the real thing!,"I have original Vornado filters and these are very different from the original manufacturers filters! While the claim is that they are real, they are actually a substitute product."
1,Smells like URINE!,"I am so dissapointed in this product. I bought it because it was a great price, and I thought it would be comparable to the Vornado filter. It is comparable in that it's the same size. BUT---and this is a BIG problem---the filters have a horrid smell. I saw this on other reviews and since others didn't mention it I thought maybe it wasn't a real problem. I was SO WRONG. As soon as you take the filters out of the plastic wrapping and sniff them you can smell it. When you put them in the humidifier---they stink up the entire house. I've been running my 2 humidifiers for 24 hours and they STILL smell. I tried putting a drop or two of lavender oil on the filters recently and it hasn't done anything to help. Something is VERY wrong here. These filters should not smell this bad. It's like someone literally peed all over them and then dried them and put them in a package for you to stink up your house with. Seriously! What is going on here?!"
3,"Its ""inpsired by"" but not nearly as shiny","Don't get me wrong - these guys are good at what they do. They certainly have some fine tracks. But if you are a die hard brown coat you'll be disappointed by some of what they've done. For example: Hero of Canton isn't done anywhere near as well as the original, in fact my only response when I first listened to it was ""Lame"". Additionally, the ""Theme song parody"" isn't a parody at all - it seems to be just a cover of the theme (nothing wrong with that - but why call it something it aint).Not so much with the shiny."
2,Good for novice,"The last Corey book which I have read is Theory and Practice of Conseling and Psychology. I was very impressed by it.I find that this book is quite different from Theory and Practice of Conseling and Psychology. In simple terms, this book is not very technical, and is very shallow in many respect. Definitely not a book which I would recommend if you are interested in studying Counseling and Psychology, in which case I would recommend you to purchase Theory and Practice of Conseling and Psychology instead.However if you are a teenager and would like to know more about yourslef, this book may not be a bad choice."
5,Wonderful Workbook,"This was a textbook assigned for an online psychology course. This was one of the best ""self-help"" books I have ever read. This book is easy to read, plus each chapter has a section for activities pertaining to the topics covered. I learned a lot about myself from this book. I recommend doing the activities and answering the questions from each chapter to get the most out of this book. Authors make this a very interesting and uncomplicated read."
1,"The Title is called "" Wish I had The book so I can Give you a review""","For those of you out there fighting the costs of expensive textbooks, just remember one thing; sometimes its better to just pay the amount of a used book. At least you will have the book, and you won't fall behind waiting a month for it to come through the mail. I am submitting a review on a textbook I don't have, even weeks past the Estimated Delivery Date.Thanks Amazon!"
5,The Best Television Mini-Series of All Time?,"Dennis Potter described himself as a ""Christian socialist"". You can feel both the pain and the redemption in this exhilarating neo-noir classic. If you saw the Steve Martin movie ""Pennies From Heaven"" (also written by Potter) you will know what to expect--but this British import is even better. Hair-raising and heart-breaking by turns, it gives ""I, Claudius' a run for the title of best show ever to come out of the British Isles."
3,"Great acting, but","Seriously, comparisons to Hamlet are a BIG stretch. There's a lot of style going on here and the songs are all very pleasant. Gambon actually sings only one song. I suppose the montage of detective story, childhood memories, musical numbers and the reality of an anguished stay in a hospital would have to be called original. But this isn't the first time reality and fantasy have been mixed and mingled. Its all very well done on an apparently very low budget. Just don't expect any great depth of meaning. Gambon's performance carries the whole show and really is the whole show."
2,Don't waste your money,"The main character is Phillip Marlow, who is a Private Investigator in every movie I've seen. The British version is the only one in which he is a hospitalized writer. The movie also drifts from his hallucinations, to the story he has written and then to reality and back to his hallucinations. Don't bother with this one."
1,"Be Careful, Very Overated","A warning to those thinking of purchasing this DVD. I purchased it on the basis of the glowing reviews posted here. Reviews that called this flawless, brilliant, the greatest TV program ever, etc. I confess that I only watched 2 episodes before putting this one away. It is extremely disturbing. The imagery in it is grotesque, potentialy offensive, and deeply disturbing. If you are a viewer who considers anything gross that pushes the boundries of acceptability art, then you will like this show. But if you are not entertained by depressing and disturbing images and topics, stay away from this one. Many people found the movie Silence of the Lambs about a murderous cannibal ""brilliant and entertaining."" If you loved Silence of the Lambs you will probably love this too. Otherwise think twice before buying this title."
4,Great,"I got this within a couple days of ordering. It even has the little booklet insert. The outside sleeve was torn at the top, but I don't think I'd have been able to figure out how to open it anyway, and would have torn it myself."
5,A Seminal Landmark in Television History,"Though not for all tastes, this six-part BBC series represents an historic occasion when television rises above its creative abyss to produce a work of seminal artistry. Written by Dennis Potter, ""The Singing Detective"" (1986) is one of the most fascinating and innovative murder-mysteries ever developed. For 392 minutes, viewers are taken on a multi-layered journey through musical fantasy and harrowing reality. Directed with exceptional verve by Jon Amiel, the series is akin to a compelling book that you cannot put down. In the pivotal role of pulp-fiction writer Philip Marlow, Michael Gambon has a difficult and, at times, grotesque challenge that few performers would undertake. Gambon brilliantly makes the character his own - perhaps the veteran actor's finest 6 hours in any medium. Rarely has television displayed the vivid imagination that can be found in Potter's masterpiece."
2,Misery and sickness,"Despite the accolades from the ""right"" people, this series is in fact one of the sickest, most disgusting, most lewd productions of the past several decades. If you're into loathing, self-disgust, childish fantasy, physical torment, and blasphemy, this is your film. If you aren't ready to vomit after the first of the six installments, you should ask yourself why. If this is an artistic masterpiece, then Western civilization is closer to extinction than many of its severest critics suspect."
3,Over-rated,"One has to wonder what the Chicago Sun Times reviewer was thinking of when he described this series as the greatest production in the history of television. A horribly burned man in a hospital has flashbacks about his life. While the flashbacks often are interesting, the hospital scenes involve a lot of trivial by-play that must be more appealing to Britons than to Americans. The camera always comes back to the scarred, oozing face and body of the detective. People who enjoy such images either have not been confronted with them in real life, or have a taste for the grotesque."
2,singing dectitves,singing ectectves was an enanting novel which is a most have for every bookshelf. on the down side the begging and middle was very slow.most peole might not like it. But I thought it was O.K
5,Superhits by Earl Thomas Conley,"this is by far the best greatest hits collection from him, miss that music on the radio! would highly recommend it, you'll be dancing all night!"
5,Great Singer Great Songs,"If you have ever liked any song by Earl Thomas Conley, you must get this CD. It has all the great hits you know and some you may have forgotten about. One of the best voices in country music."
1,Not performed by Burt Bacharach!,"Unfortunately I purchased this album believing that it was performed by Burt Bacharach. And not. I suggest to advert more clearly to the customers of it, to avoid dissatisfaction."
4,Very very good,"Very good album, my favorite is track 5-very upbeat. In whole the rest of the album is very good, too, but I think some of her stuff with Billy Childish might be better-it seemed very hynotic, but still check out her new album!!!!"
1,great music to jump rope by if your 9 yrs old and angry,"this jumbly wombly babble is not really music, more angry poetry set tothe copy-cat unimaginative ""same-old"" cadence of modern rap music whose main message is always violent and anti-beauty and art. I did want to listen to it because someone recommended it..keep an open mind you know,but I think music really needs to get past this stage. It's great as a musical experiment, but I'm hoping society can move forward into thefuture with better genres than this. If everybody listens to this junk,then our prisons will end up filled by the brainwashed.(..but that's only my opinion, so please don't come shoot me.)Have a nice day,."
3,"It's still Gotthard,maybe 4 stars?","After being blown away by their last release (Lipservice),I was anxiously awaiting the follow up from Gotthard.Let me first say that this is not a bad cd,but it pales in comparison to Lipservice,but to be fair,so does pretty much everything else out there.Standout tracks on this one are:Master of Illusion,The Oscar goes to you,and the call.The songs aren't bad,but they have done better. If you are new to this band,do yourself a favor and pick up Lipservice,Open,or the Human Zoo prior to buying this. This cd is not a good representation of how good these guys are.After another listen after my initial review,maybe 3 stars isn't fair.It is a very good cd,but I still do not hold it as high as Lipservice,Open,or Human Zoo.Anything by these guys is worth having."
3,Good Cold Air Intake,This is a very well constucted cold air intake and I wish i could have been able to use it on my 2004 Honda Civic. It would have taken too many modifications in order to install it correctly.
2,Not Easy Listening,"I just want to alert others that this is not ""easy listening."" Jazzy, yes, but also a little grating if you're expecting the smooth, golden tones that Boots can produce. It arrived with a different CD cover than is pictured here--again, jazzier. It is recorded with the Tommy Newsom Jazztet."
4,So very cool!,"The Flaming Lips deserve so much more than their 15 minutes of MTV/radio fame permit them. Sure, ""She Don't Use Jelly"" is a good song, but they are capable of so much more. This collection of Lips songs proves it. The previous review is correct. Wayne continuously rips the band as being mediocre, but I really think the material is incredible. I only wish that half of the bands that crowd the television and airwaves had half the talent or creativity of the Lips! With songs like ""Jesus Shootin' Heroin"", who needs pop culture icons like Dave Matthews and Trent Reznor?!? And wait until you hear 'The Soft Bulletin'!!!!!!"
2,"Written in 1983, this book is due for a much needed update.","From the moment I discovered that I was pregnant with twins I ran to the bookstore to obtain any and all information available on carrying multiples to term. Twins, is not poorly written but a dry example of what not to write for expectant mothers. It is negative and at times scary. Not only is the information old and dated but terminology and phraseology are from 15+ years ago. Information that is so important for a mother of twins should be comprehensive and timely. I would not recomend this book except as a reference guide for terminology that has not changed."
4,"Cool tunes, like a soft summer breeze","Excellent musicianship, very relaxing tunes. I especially enjoy the song, 'Bonin'. You can actually sense the sheer enjoyment of the struggle between man and fish on the open sea. Walker's music is almost always soothing without being boring. I have several of his CD's, but this is the one I always look for first when I'm in a chllin' mood."
5,Fits Perfect,"Its a perfect fit in my 98 Civic. Looks great, just lay it out flat for a few days before putting it in your car."
5,The Virgin Soldiers,"I thought the book was excellent. Unfortunately, I had read the third book in the trilogy (Stand Up Virgin Soldiers) before this one - the first one. This left me somewhat confused as to the sequence of events, but still pleased with Thomas's description of events."
1,Should be burnt,"The author wanted to write a dirty native American novel,but why he dragged St Kateri Tekakwitha into it is beyond me. There is little here that is associated with the brave Mohawk maiden save name and locale. The book is filled with dirty scenes and scarcely any thing resembles the real Lily of the Mohawks...it's like the writer dropped her name into the book to try to cash in on her popularity,or to lure innocent well meaning readers into his poorly conceived erotic soap opera. If this book were rated my the same ratings the movies go by,it would be 'R',or maybe even 'NC-17'...it most certainly is 'No Catholic under 17' !!!!"
3,From RichardatOxford.,"Tracks are split between a trio and a big brass sound.Brass,in the lower register,take the forefront,both jazzy and smooth with,overall,elsewhere,flute being as prevalent as sax and trumpet (the flute is exclusive to the trio).Mendes leading from the piano,on all numbers.Drums and double bass; well presented,not drowned out.Some very good tracks: about half of the total; mostly the trio.Brass has to be very good to cut it,with me,these days.Fine musicians enjoying themselves."
5,Bought for a H22A4,Does fit. Very high quality and its from Japan. Note it was shipped in a yellow seal envelope. Wish it was packaged a little more.
2,NOT A Vpars Bible,"Having already read much literature on Vpars, I found Mr. Paniotowski's Virtual Partition Book to be no more than adequate on the primary subject matter. At 1000+ pages there is a enormous amount information dedicated to all things HP-UX - and most of this is non-vpars specific. Not that I don't appreciate the lagniappe, but the book reads like an ""HP-UX Guide to Systems Administration"" rather than a ""Guru's Insight Into Virtual Partitions"". If you are looking to gain insight into Vpars and the SuperDome, you'll get a whopping 14 pages dedicated to this subject matter as Paniotowski based nearly all of his work on the L and N class systems. On a positive note, after reading the few chapters that were actually dedicated to vpars, I did learn a few things that I had not come across in other literature. Paniotowski needs to produce a 2nd Edition of this book that focuses exclusively on Virtual Partitions and has far more subject manner dedicated to the SuperDome."
1,Junk,"Did not work at all. The hook ups were clear and easy to read and follow. Even a diagram for the insertion of the batteries. However, when test time came, the apparatus did not work at all. When I switched the button to telephone, silence. I only got a dial tone when I switched the button to computer, albeit that no computer was hooked up to the apparatus. When I got a dial tone, the apparatus did not amplify anything. Jabra Customer service was of no help. As a result, I have returned this item to Amazon. I rarely return items as long as they at least marginally function."
3,Review..,"Vey conforting. The words are uplifting,and will carry you to a safe place. This music will grow on you. When you wanto take a break from the other style of music you listen to."
5,Beautiful earrings delivered quick,No complaints. The earrings were beautiful and came in a very cute gift box which I did not even have to wrap.
5,A must read book,"I have read many ""how to hear the voice of God"" books,and this is the first one that actually helped me.And it helped a lot. This book goes through all theways God communicates, dreams, visions, and conversationin prayer. I have read better stuff in the dreams/visionscategory and Mark himself recommends other authors in thiscategory also. But in the dialog part this book beats them all,and is the only one I have read to date that really helps.There is a lot more out there than we realize, daily dialogwith a loving God who is your best friend is not just possible,but is desired by all (God and us), so step into a new dimensionin your walk and read this book!"
3,much older than indicated,"While the book appeared to be in decent condistion, it was very old and the pages were somewhat yellowed. The best that it should have been rated is 'good'."
4,Collapsis tops the soundtrack with catchy tune.,"This soundtrack is very good through and through. Collapsis' track, ""Clay Pigeons (The Ballad of Lester Long)"" takes the cake, though. I'd heard that they were gonna be on the soundtrack (they're from the area) so I figured I'd check it out. That song is great... quarky, but great. Mike Garrigan has been playing that kind of music around The Triangle (Raleigh, Durham, Chapel Hill) since 1993, and since forming Collapsis it's only gotten better. I'd highly recommend not only this soundtrack, but ""The Chartreuse EP"" they released in Oct. '98. I think their major-label debut will come out this Fall, too.So, yes... Clay Pigeons is a good soundtrack especially topped off with a song by a great band... Collapsis. Check 'em out!!"
5,More than Excellent,"I agree with both of the comments below. The film was my favorite of last year, and I love the soundtrack. It even turned me on to country Music. Timeless, Ballad Of Lester Long and Sea Of Heartbreak are my favorite tracks. Friends have even suggested that I have listened to it more than anyone else in the world. It is also nice to know that there is another fan in Brookline"
2,the best song was missing!,"I absolutely loved Clay Pigeons - I've made anyone visiting watch it. That's how much I love it. But the cd disappointed me because it left out some songs most importantly ""It's Now or Never"" which was, in my opinion, played at a crucial point in the movie and at one of my favorite scenes. The scene was when Lester was in ""Vixon's"" kitchen getting a beer & he eyed the butcher block on the counter. He then picked up the biggest knife, tipped his cowboy hat forward & that's when the song played which was so cool. So why that song & others didn't make the soundtrack is beyond me but nevertheless, disappointing. -LJ"
5,Quite Possibly LA's Best Poet,"The nearly undisputed Empress of SoCal poetry, Laurel Ann Bogen has garnered- and deserved- the accolades of L.A.'s literati elite (whoever they are- and why don't we get invited to their parties?) without losing her grasp on the everyday world. Bogen writes with a near devastating ferocity and a spell-binding sort of grace. The breadth of her literary canvas is startling. Whether her muse is waxing political (""The War nestled dreamily like all good babies/ broken crockery and smashed in faces. Our world without end. Amen."" or carving a Halloweenish portrait of a Jack O' Lantern (ending with an elegant, ""What do you fear"") Bogen transcends the earthbound scribbling of other writers. Her poetry is a window into a world of horrific beauty and exquisite madness. It is supple, surprising, and imminently moving. Her world is a disconcerting place- strange and wracked with pain, but instantly recognizable. It's the world outside your window."
3,3.5 actually...,"I give this album 3.5 stars because it's nowhere near Lucybell's masterpiece, ""Amanece"". Gone are the electronic passages in order to pursue a more hardened rock sound. It's not that the songs are bad, but it sometimes lacks a little bit of that something that made Lucybell different from the rest of the pack. The production is superb and the voice sounds amazing. I'm not really nuts about the new drummer as he plays in some songs as though it was a punk ensemble and lacks the psychedelic groove that the previous drummer had. All in all a solid effort but if you want the best from Lucybell, buy 'Amanece' or the self titled 'Lucybell'."
5,Fantastic !!!,"This is one of the best jazz albums if not THE best ever. What a collaboration !!! Two of the best sax players ever. Real genuine jazz. They don't make jazz albums like this anymore. My favorite tunes are ""Good Morning Heartache"", ""Night Train"" And the closing number. In My opinion , this was the last REAL jazz album released . Then it all changed."
2,must be old style,"I need a headset for work that doesn't go over my head. One of the ear pieces in this set, which is an oval that fits around the whole ear was very comfortable, and the quick release cord was wonderful, but I had to send it back, as the microphone tube kept slipping down below my chin. It might have just been defective, but I also didn't like the large foam around the mic. I kept seeing it in my peripherial vision, and it felt too obvious as I walked around the office. It worked, when it wasn't slipping down, but I just didn't like the way it looked. I had to get what I think is a newer sound tube mic, which is the same brand, but I think a much improved model of racheting boom for the mic, which I like a lot. I also tried the over the ear hook--not good at all. The oval ear loop is best!"
5,One of the few drives for backing up Wii games,"I don't know what the previous review is about - sounds bitter - I have used this drive before and it worked perfectly. Seems like the above reviewer had a defective DVD-ROM.Here is the info from wikipedia:""A DVD drive capable of reading Wii and GC discsOnly specific drives are capable of reading Wii and GC discs, obviously in addition to the drive you will also need it installed in a PC with proper drives. At present the only drives known to be capable of reading Wii and GC discs are the following:* Hitachi LG GDR-8161b (IDE)* Hitachi LG GDR-8162b (IDE)* Hitachi LG GDR-8163b (IDE)* Hitachi LG GDR-8164b (IDE)* Hitachi LG GDR-H10NBLK (SATA)* Hitachi LG GDR-8082N - USB SLIM Portable Drive""If your in the market for this - then this is the DVD drive for you."
4,Works in older computers to copy Wii an Gamecube games!,I bought two of these an both worked perfect! If your looking at these cause you want too mack backups of your original Wii an GameCube games then this is for you!
1,wrong equipment bought,I bought this it did not work on my computer so I haven't used it so I don't know how it works.
5,perfect for what i bought it for.,Worked very well on the reason i bought it for.Luckly as it is quite rare. It could read special wii and gamecube disks.
5,16x DVD-ROM Drive,"I bought this drive and it has gave me good service. Working on used desktop computers is a hobby of mine and most of the time I wipe the hard drive clean and reinstall the Operating System, and to make this go smooth and trouble free you need a good drive, that is fast enough to get the job done and this 16x DVD-ROM Drive reads CDs at 52x, and when I am working on a machine that needs the OS reinstalled I just remove the drive thats in the machine and put this drive in and it always does a good job, you can just tell by the sound of it that its faster than most drives, and after the files get installed from the disc onto the hardrive and the OS installation is complete I remove this drive and put the original drive back in. Thats what I bought it for and I am pleased with it, It has been a usefull tool for me, and its price is resonable to so basically its a good drive and its cheap,I have nothing bad to tell about it."
1,WARNING.DONT BUY THIS DVD,dont buy this dvd player.it will stop detecting dvd's after a while and lg doesn't seem to give a damn about this error.go online you will see that many lg dvd owners have this problem as well.dont buy!!!
1,AWFUL can opener,"This can opener sucks!! I bought mine from Walmart. For $6, you get what you pay for. I have a hard time trying to get the thing to grip the can. I am buying another one and not Rival!"
1,Unusable can opener,"I had to revert to my 7-year-old Rival can opener, because the new one would not grip the can rim.Rival CN738-W Automatic Can OpenerThis is my first total failure in a variety of products I've ordered from Amazon.com. Needless to say, I'm not a happy camper at the moment."
1,"just bad for opening cans, tips over, drops can.",this rival can opener is useless. tips over while opening cans. drops cans when nere opened.
1,Not So Much.,"All I can say, I tossed not one but two IRobots away. All done with these. Never had much luck with battery household items for any length of time. I say plug it in!"
3,the People Magazine version,"This book is mostly a collection of spicy anecdotes, with a little historical narrative thrown in. If you're looking for any kind of in-depth analysis of the era, or of Manet's art, look elsewhere; if you want a light read, it's OK."
1,Print and paper quality is less than 1 star,"Please note this negative review is NOT about the contents and authors but ONLY the print quality of the book. The standard-priced copy I ordered and received from Amazon was the worst I have seen. I honestly don't know if it is Prentice Hall PTR decision to print books in such poor quality or I received a faked copy from Amazon.The whole book is just like a photocopy from the original book. Some of the printed words are so faint that it is hard to read; on the first page of most chapters, the first letter in the opening sentence is half-missing in the print; the paper used was obvious of inferior quality. I would actually doubt it is an original real book. I have not read the book yet. This sounds like a good book but you need to be able to read it as well. Hope others will take note before ordering any book from Prentice Hall, from which I have many other books before and they are of good print quality."
3,Beware typos ahead!!,"I use three books at a time to study for the SAT II Biology exam. No review book is perfect; athlough, I would highly suggest buying a copy of Barron's. Until reaching page 85, I rather liked McGraw-Hill and thought that Barron's was getting a run for its money!! But seeing as though McGraw-Hill got the forumla for the Krebs Cycle wrong due to a typo, I have lost a lot of confidence. 2 NADH ARE NOT THE NET GAIN FROM KREBS PER PYRUVATE! IT IS 3!!! 2NADH per Pyruvate would leave us 6 ATP short! Not good!Other than that rant, McGraw-Hill does give some good outside information and yet another perspective on Biology-something you really need when facing the exam!Proceed with caution!"
5,Great Book on a Great Subject,"One of his many on the city's neighborhoods, this book captures the old balck U Street in all its glory. Nicely done indeed!"
1,Boring.....,"I love my music chilled, but this put me to sleep. Its boring and old fashioned and sounds like everything else you have in your music library, been there done that.... don't bother. Disappointed."
2,Galen Rowell laid his first egg here,"I have read all of Galen's books, God rest his soul, but I was really disappointed with this book. It's a collection of things about how good a photographer he is. I already know he was a great photographer but what I wanted is some ideas how I could get better. After 200 pages or so, I gave up reading the rest. Some info. is useful but 90% of the 280 pages were just plain boring."
1,"Self-serving, preachy, little info",This is a book in which Rowell attempts to convince us how wonderful he is. It did more to describe how super-duper his shots were without telling us much about the thought process that went into creating those moments.
5,A remarkable book from a remarkable photographer,"As an underwater photographer, I have a lot of books about this type of photography, but not many about topside shooting. Frankly, I have read enough about apertures and shutter speeds to last me a lifetime.This book appealed to me because it talks less about the technical aspects, and more about the philosophical approaches to outdoor photography. Galen Rowell has made some incredible photographs, and I am inspired by his approach and how he remains true to his vision.There is also a good discussion on the ethics of digital manipulation - a very timely and relavant topic.Get this book. Having read it, I have been inspired to order 3 more of Rowell's books"
4,Need to mine for info,"There is plenty of philosophy in this book based on his own experiences. If you're looking purely for a techniques book or how-to or teachings of his techniques, you'd might be disappointed because it's not organized as such although some good techniques and info are in there. You just need to do some information-mining."
1,Disappointed,"Galen Rowell was a great photographer, but he blathers on in this book, which I did not find at all helpful. Plus, many of the photos are tiny and the book is poorly designed.I found Brenda Tharp's Creative Nature and Outdoor Photography much more helpful, with larger photos and a better designed layout."
3,heavy going,"This book is heavy going,ok for professionals,or for those with a degree in psychology.I know this guy was good,but I only got halfway thru this book before I said ''enough''.Not a book for amateurs."
2,Good for older cards,"I have used this card reader for a couple of years now and had mixed results. Typically, it will simply not read any of the newer high speed card types so it is growing more and more useless for me. It does read some of my older SD budget cards, but the Compact Flash Platinum 80x sitting in front of me is not recognized. I would recommend it if you have older budget speed flash cards and do not plan on upgrading, these readers are so cheap you can find better alternatives with a wider support range now."
5,Just what I was looking for!,I had looked around locally for this and was not happy with the pricing I was seeing. I found it on Amazon for half the price. It was in original packaging and exactly what the discription said. Thank you Amazon for once again making my shopping experience the best.
5,Timely and fulfilling,"I ordered this for my mother, a crafter, through Amazon. Although the expected arrival date was projected to be 8-12 wks after ordering, and thus missing her birthday, the magazines began arriving almost immediately. Plus, as a crafter, she really rates these magazines highly."
5,Great Ideas!,"I've really been enjoying reading through these magazines! I get so many great ideas and I love the fact that it tells you where you can find all the items. If the person in the article made up the items themselves, they explain what items they used to make the decor. I'm not a trendy person, so seeing how people decorate in homey ways really appeals to me."
3,"Love the magazine, but....","The magazine itself is great. The problem is that my subscription was supposed to begin with the May issue. I got the May issue about 3 weeks ago and today I received the March issue. I'd already bought the March issue at the grocery store because my subscription wasn't supposed to start until the May issue. With the subscription only being 6 times/year to begin with, I really got ripped off. If I had known that I either wouldn't have bought the March issue, or I just wouldn't have ordered the subscription. I'm rather disappointed and so far have seen no way of contacting anyone about it."
5,How can one explain flaws in a 5-star rating?,"I have found this a very entertaining collection for those dark nights here, and having no TV I can watch it on the computer.As others have already indicated, The Gathering (the original movie/episode to begin production of the show) is a good place to start, even (or especially) for people who haven't learned the outlines of the story yet. This collection is then interesting to watch: for the improvement in the prosthetics worn by many actors, the development of much more moving stories (here, it is appropriate to mention Londo Mollari's talents as a storyteller/emperor), and the better production quality once things got going (including wonderful music). The only hard point is the acceptance that the story Thirdspace COULD have happened between the Shadow war and Earthwar. No way!"
5,I like a lot OK,Most things I Review I say yep or nope. So I’m short about 19 0r so words for your review.
2,Kind of disappointing quality,"There are some quality issues at various places through out the seasons. They appear to be quality boxes, but its like a bad after market rip of the original DVD's. The artwork on the DVD's looks quality (what I would expect), but overall made me wonder if these were all legit from the production company.. I would steer clear of these, as I do not remember the quality being this low when I originally watched these."
3,Amzing,"I like bablylon 5 eventhough the cgi is crappy comapared to today's standards, but you have to keep in mind that cgi technology was not aas advanced as it is today bakc when these movies where filmed (late 1990's). The story behind the movies are amzaing. I specially liked ""A Call To Arma"" because it explains how Crusade (sequel to the babylon 5 series, albeit short-lived). Overall: BABYLON 5 (and Crusade) RULES!!! :)"
2,Babylon 5 The Movie Collection,"Turns out that most of the movies were not very good, just the one that shows how things started."
2,B5-Movie Collection,"One of the movies - 'In the Beginning' got to me all scratched up. I tried playing it but it froze up on me toward the end of the movie. I gave Amazon 2 stars for this because at least they promptly refunded me my entire purchase back + the shipping. I don't know what happened but it's kind of wierd that only one of the DvDs was damaged. It was in the socket when I got it too so I don't think it was caused by shipping. Oh well, buyer beware I guess."
3,Not nearly as good as the series,"Although I recognize the need to omit characters in certain movies, I would've preferred to see Sheridan, Londo and G'Kar as the stars of the movies since they are my favorite characters. Perhaps in the sense of the TNG movies which focused on Picard for every film.OK, the soundtrack to Crusade was nothing less than horrible. Let's leave it at that. Really detracted away from the movie experience which was all ready not that spectacular.Characters are twisted and turned in Arms, etc. I found the technomages in the entire series a bit cheesey. They were supposed to use technology to mimic magic, but how does the technomage able to give Sheridan revelations? The thief character was nothing special. A thief with an attitude and a loner type. Not very original. It seems like they purposely make Sheridan into a second rate character so they can 'boost' his replacements which was a bit lame."
3,History line,"Althoug is a very good producction I would have chosen other parts from the Babylon 5 to build this 5 part movie collection, because the history line looses a bit especially in movies 3 and 4 that do not connect as well as 1, 2 and 5 do.I missed the shadow war!!!!!!!!!!!"
5,good,I love this series and was glad to find it. I received this in good time. I have all the rest of the seasons. Now I have all the collections.
2,"Some good, some lousy","Loved In the Beginning and Third Space. The other three were duds. We own the complete 5 seasons and dearly love B5. Two stars because only two movies are worth watching. And Martin Sheen is TERRIBLE. Gawd, who cast him in this? He walks around like his contacts don't fit and can't decide what kind of accent he should have. Painful to watch."
1,Where is the Blu-ray versions????,Where are the blu-ray versions of this epic sci fi series?? They need to release the the whole run and the tv movies all in blu-ray.
3,Unfortunate,With one exception this collection appears to be more a selection of deleted scenes from the series. As a commited fan of Babylon 5 this seems unfortunate to me.
5,Great series,Aweosome series and the movies are great no annoying commericals product came when it was suppose too and i got my moneys worth
4,Broken,The inside of one of the movie cases was broken but they were otherwise good done done done done done
4,A nice extra for B5 fans,"If you enjoyed Babylon 5 you will enjoy this collection of movies. Each is about 90 minutes long and amounts to an extended episode. They are fine as stand-alone pieces, but it does help to be familiar with the series. We are glad we bought them, because they complete the set and were satisfying additions to our B5 collection."
4,B5 -- The movies,"Two of the five movies gave important background showing how the political situation on Space Station Babylon 5 came to be. The other three are periferal stories not needed for the series main story-line (as was true of about 40% of the individual episodes) but interesting and well done by-the-ways during and shortly after the main five-year series.Well done, but I expected more nearly theatrical (or at least made-4-TV) movie production values, but what I saw was barely up tro the standards of the run of the mill B% series episodes."
3,Babylon 5 Movie Collection,The DVDs were without flaw. The movies hold one's interest but; not as well as the series. The first and last movies (The Gathering - A Call to Arms) were the best of the five. For the price you can't go wrong.
4,Always go with repackaged if possible!,I have bought each season of Babylon 5 on Amazon and all of them repackaged. Top notch quality. A little bit of fray on the edges of the box but that doesn't bother me one little bit.
3,Less than memorable,"Other than the Pilot and ""In the Beginning,"" the films are less than stellar (not all the principals were involved in the production of the later films, and the cost limitations are evident in the lack of crowds in the public spaces of the station, etc."
3,Video not up to par or even VHS,"The Video is even worse than Andromeda - Complete Series - 30-DVD Box Set.The VHS video is better Much better than the DVD Video is this set. Not sure it was worth the $170.00. Or at least watching on a 55"" 3D TV in 2D Mode!."
1,Rehash minus one,"As it was pointed out by another reviewer, Zmudzinski, this boxed set is just the same as one offered earlier. Even the same titles are included in the ""new"" boxed set.One would hope that in this latest collection of B5 movies the inclusion of the straight to video original movie ""The Lost Tales"" would have been included. It is not.I just don't understand why this boxed set is of any value."
2,What a disappointment,"Having purchased all the Babylon 5 related DVD's it's going be awhile before I have the time to view them all.Having said that delivery and the added viewing material and commentary to the DVD's are fine and I'm happy with that, however the actual copies are very disappointing. Screen pixilation and dropped frames from the video are a real shame. Whether Warner Brothers were trying to save money or compress the video to fit the series on less DVD's I don't know, but the result is, as I said, terribly disappointing."
3,tote with slide drawer,"the tote seemed to be well constructed, but awfully small. i use it to carry veterarian supplies in, and if it was half again bigger it would be perfect."
4,Very good book for learning written Vietnamese,"This book is very thorough for learning written Vietnamese. You can order the accompanying CDs directly from the publisher, and they are a must to learn to speak and understand Vietnamese. The CDs don't give much time to repeat phrases and can be annoying. The sentences can be stupid (e.g. Is this a book or a pencil?), but there's not a lot out there if you want to learn Vietnamese, and this is some of the most complete information I have seen."
3,Need a tutor,"This book is good, but you would need a tutor who speaks Vietnamese for it to be much help. It is impossible to know how to pronounce words in another language. It would be perfect for a classroom setting."
2,Doesn't do full justice,"This isn't the best recording of the Brandenburg Concerti available. The performance is plodding, overly technical, deficient in energy, lacking a real sense of the ""ensemble"" a good Bach performance needs, not as graceful and uplifting as the music demands. Background ""clicks"" can also be heard occasionally. The ""bonus"" piece, the Concerto for Harpsichord, Strings and Continuo in D major at the end of the disc, comes on too forcefully with the downbeats -- a bit like the opening chords of The Who's ""Tommy"" -- and the harpsichord is too dominant throughout the piece. Brandenburg Concerto No. 3 is given the best treatment, and the Berlin Chamber Orchestra is to be commended for including the full-length Adagio Cadenza as the second movement, which can be rarely found. But don't be swayed by this disc's low price. Invest in the best!"
3,Not as described,"Love the content. Read it to my children and purchased this book for my first grandchild.The book was described as hardback and i received a paperback. Unhappy. Sent email to seller, but no response."
4,the book is great,you can't beat the cost but missing some fine detail information that you would fine in honda manuals. but for the beginning mech. that prefers to do some preventive maintaince and little trouble shooting its great.
4,Excellent Understated Score,"Desplat does what few can in ""Syriana,"" mixing the adrenaline of a John Powell score and the extremely understated compositional style of Philip Glass. With Syriana, Desplat has proven his worth as a truly contemporary film score composer, using high quality sounds and music to not only back up a film, but to actually work with it simultaniously. Even if you haven't seen the film, Desplat's score is still a work of art to be purchased and enjoyed.Highly reccomended for avid film score listeners."
5,A tale told from the heart,"Tim's story is told simply and is clearly written from the heart. I found it hard to put down, with it's combination of overcoming hardships, insights into the fabulous world of shuttle operations at NASA, inspiration and dedication to follow a dream and the laugh-out-loud humour all told in Tim's inimitable fashion.I can't wait for his next work - and if you haven't already read Launch Fever - do it now!"
5,Valuable nuggets of life experiences,"I started reading this book on a flight from Birmingham to Madison. As I started on the first page of the book, Mr. Taylor got me hooked on to the book with his humble opening and inspirational message. As I read through the book, being an engineer myself, I could relate to several of his life experiences. His advise at the end of each of the chapter is simple in wording but full of wisodm and practical experience. I could not keep the book down even for a minute till I finished this book. Great read for anyone, especially an engineer who wants to be an entrepreneur."
4,Mystery still unsolved,"I read this book many years ago and just re-read it last year. It is a chillingly mysterious story of a man driven by circumstance into a plan of deception that ended in an empty sailboat found floating in the Atlantic. It is almost like a story of morals. Mr. Crowhurst sets out to circumnavigate the globe in a sailboat race. Finding himself not up to the task he decides to ""fake"" his voyage and does a remarkable job of it - until, apparently, the strain of it all drives him insane.I found it a fascinating book, well done, well documented, and as thrilling as any fiction novel. In fact, I suspect that because it really did happen makes it a more compelling story. I am a fan of all sailing adventure books and this one has all the elements of a global sailboat race, plus the mystery of Mr. Crowhurst's last days of life."
3,It was ok.,The story was interesting but in too much detail. I would have liked to seen more followup on what happened after his boat was found.
4,Rather Fascinating,"Hmm...I was on the fence about this book to begin with. I got it thinking it was the story of some heroic maritime feat, only to find it was about a colossal HOAX. However, I followed each small decision until Crowhurst had maneuvered himself into a situation from which there was no way out: suicide...ruin...or death? A documentary has been made about the same subject, called Deep Water. It's not much good as a stand-alone DVD, but is a good addition to the book. I ended up being pretty fascinated by the whole affair."
5,Great,"The other reviews said it all. Great book. I like the true-life adventure genre, and this one is near the top of the list. Crowhurst really lost it at the end. Wow.If you liked this book, you might try Adrift, by Steve Calahan."
3,Too Technical,"I made it half way through this book, hoping it was an exciting or at least intriguing mystery. Unfortunately, the first half of the book was mostly about the building of the boat. Although for sailors this may be interesting and definitely needed to be told as it led up to events, I would have preferred to jump right into the mystery/disappearance and then worked back though events that led to the ending.It did not keep my interest enough to finish the book, so I gave the copy to my brother who IS a sailor."
4,"Great Book, but Released Too Soon...","This trivia book has just about everything you need to know about Friends. It's not just question and answer, like in the trivia game; this book has multiple choice and fill in the blank questions! Plus, they're much more in depth and difficult to answer!The questions are divided into seasons 1-9, which would make it easy for someone who missed a season to catch up quickly. Not only that, but there's an episode guide in the back that goes halfway through season 9. That's where the book lacks...This book should have been released when the series ended. That way, it would be complete. This book doesn't even have the entire ninth season! I think they should have just waited and made a trivia book about the entire series, or at least waited to get the entire ninth. Other than that, this book is amazing, a MUST HAVE for any Friends fan...unless they come out with an update once the show ends."
5,A must have book for any Friends fan!,"As a huge Friends fanatic, I just love this book. It's so entertaining! The trivia is divided into nine chapters by each season and there are over a hundred questions pertaining to each season. Scattered throughout the book, you'll find various black & white photos from the show, multiple choice quizzes and bits of trivia (for example, you will find out when Jennifer Aniston's ""The Rachel"" hairstyle debuted).In addition to all of the trivia questions, there's an episode guide (which goes all the way up to ""The One With the Memorial Service"" from the ninth season), eight pages of photos (there are some from the show and others are cast publicity shots), a foreword by Gunther (James Michael Tyler) and more!""Friends: The One About The #1 Sitcom"" is truly a must have for any fan of Friends. Lauren Johnson did a fantastic job of putting this book together."
1,Not worth it,"I checked this book out at a local store before plunking out my cash for it... and decided it was completely not worth it. It's nothing but a lot of trivia questions that are a) insulting to a true fan or b) too obscure for a casual viewer to know. I expected behind-the-scenes stories and trivia, not this thrown-together mishmash.The only thing halfway worth getting the book for is the essay written by the man who plays Gunther (can't think of his name right now).So unless you're a huge Gunther fan (or an obsessed 'gotta have all merchandise' Friends fan), don't bother."
5,A great place to start for the uninitiated,"My wife and I both read this book over 6 years ago and feel it is a great place to start if you want to educate yourself on the actual issues that govern ""the drug problem;"" if you are already well-versed on the subject, you will not find much here that will excite you.Personally, I felt that this book is balanced and does a good job of intimating the complexity of the topic to the reader and brings to light subtleties that get lost in the shouting matches that are typically indicative of the disucussion at hand.Rarely are issues simple; reading this book will help the uninitiated realize that this is one of the most complicated issues of our time."
3,Not the product that is shown.. but still good,"I ordered this about 2 weeks ago.. shipping came fast ( APO so it takes a minute tog et here) and well for starters.. the litter box i recived is not 7 inches tall like advertised... it is 10""... not complaining... my bunny is little now but i know how fast they grow and it will come in handy, secondly. there is no way to attach it to the cage that i can see.... thirdly, in the picture it shows angled sides... this one has curvy sides. i got mine in lime-ish green for any of those whom were curious of what colors are arriving, not really worried about that sense it says colors may vary.. but size and shape should not... over all i think it will fit the purpous well as long as my rabbit chooses not to use the litter pan as a toy and trys to push it around, just glad im using a dog crate for its cage and made the shelf in the middle, not on the lower level or it wouldnt have fit. it is a thick plastic so i forsee it holding up to time in cage with bunny:)"
2,Not for small cages,I wish this product had measurements listed it much larger than it looks. It didn't leave my rabbit much room to move around it the cage. She took to sleeping in it.
1,Not as pictured,"I was hoping to get the item pictured in the description. Unfortunately I received a different item with the same item number. Apparently the manufacturer must have replaced the older model with a newer one. The photo should be updated to reflect the model that goes with the item number.Sadly, the litter box went back."
1,Not as pictured,"The litter pan is not as pictured. As another reviewer commented, the ones being sent have curvy, higher sides. My rabbit is used to the one shown in the picture and cannot jump from the side into the one being shipped (the one with curvy, higher sides). Therefore, she hates this litter pan and will not use it. I agree that Amazon needs to display a picture of the actual product being shipped."
3,Litter Pan,I have a litter pan just like the one pictured for the product so I thought thats what I was getting. It was not what I got the litter pan I received is slightly different It works for what we need but I do like the one shown in the picture better.
5,Great stuff!,"Look past the price tag on this one. Lots of excellent obscure tunes and a very informative, photo filled book to go with it."
2,1950s Punk?,"Rockin Bones: 1950s Punk & Rockabilly might be a great Rockabilly compilation... but make no mistake, there is nothing remotely Punk about this release. There were a few Proto-Punk groups that pre-dated the Punk phenomenon (around 1975-76) but nothing that stretches back to the 1950s. I imagine that Rhino's marketing team probably thought that they could get a few more sales if they added Punk to the title.Punk and Rockabilly didn't really meet until the Post-Punk era with artists likeRobert Gordon(1977),The Cramps(1980),Stray Cats(1981),Tav Falco(1982), andReverend Horton Heat(1992).For a good Proto-Punk compilation check outMax's Kansas City 1976or Rhino's box setNo Thanks: 70s Punk Rebellion."
2,potpourri,a kind of mixt of different styles...The tile shows just one song by Rubinstein...others are in a different style.Not the best CD.Martin
5,Like the old days.,"Just brings back memories of days past. Not easy to find the product any more. Ordering, processing and delivery went as smooth as silk."
5,erik,bought these guns recently as a package because it seemed like a pretty good deal. I really like the fact that they are oilless. however i am wondering if that will shorten the lifespan of the guns. I have only used them for a small job so far and they worked great. pretty simple to use. lightweight and easy to load. no problems yet.
4,Newbie to nailers,"I am new to nailers; therefore, I asked for advice from more experienced friends. The features that were described to me that I needed in a nailer these two nailers met except for the directional exhaust (hence 4 stars instead of 5). Shipping/delivery of the nailers was great, arrived sooner then was projected. The finish nailer didn't work at first but that was probably my mix-up on nail lock-out feature. The manual said to test the unit prior to first use and part of the test was to remove the nails. The finish nailer requires nails to be loaded to work (lockout feature) but the manual tells you to test unit without nails loaded. Once I loaded the nails into the unit I finish putting up trim work on two windows in less then a half hour. I used the finish nailer and brad nailer in conjunction to put trim up. I have used the unit now two or three times so far and very happy with it. I like the oil-less feature the best."
1,RIP OFF,So i take the coil out of the package and everything looks great and im super excited i dont have to carry my c02 tank on the gun anymore. But when i plug it into the c02 all the air comes spraying through a leak in the coil and within seconds all my c02 is gone. BUMMER
2,"Great case, if you only use you PDA as a phone!!","It is a really nice case. The keyboard can not be used unless removing the phone from the case. This can't be accomplished easily. You must remove the entire apparatus from your belt, and pull the phone out. The case is so tight that when you take the phone from the case to use the keyboard, the case pulls the battery cover off. If you do not use the keybaord on a daily basis this is your case. If it is used daily, find something else. It also has plastic over the screen so to use the stylus it must be removed as well. If you are using the phone only, then get this case, otherwise, this goes in the box with the other 20 unusable cell phone cases I have aquired for this device."
5,Warm,I found this film engaging and uplifting. One of those films that makes you think about the essential things in life in a healthy and inspiring way.
2,"Bowie is the only real star here, has good message for kids.","So your search for anything Bowie has finally led you here. The story seems like a resurrected after school special with silly adventures and dialogue that just doesn't exist for kids. But then David (Mr. Rice) starts speaking... and things don't seem so bad. Uh, then again. A 400 year old man you would think wouldn't require kids to let's say, exhume a corpse! There is a message to the movie, very predictable, but this movie doesn't get past it's simpleton plot. And for you diehard Bowie fans, you'll love how he and his voice take over."
5,Johnny Hartman collection 1947-1972,"Johnny Hartman is one of the all time greats and I love his voice, this album is special as he didn't make many and should have done. People need to discover these wonderful performers and record co. need to keep bringing out their albums for future generations, they don't make performers like this anymore"
5,Johnny Hartman..A Discovery for New Generations.,"For the generations who may not have heard of vocalist Johnny Hartman....you have a treat in store if you love jazz standards in the style of Eckstine, Joe Williams, Arthur Prysock, and Nat ""King"" Cole. Oh...and Sinatra, too. Warm and mellow. There is no other word but superb. Amazon is full of great treasures..all available at your fingertips."
2,Couldn't get into it,"Maybe I'm missing something, but I couldn't get past a few chapters of this book. It is sometimes eloquent, but seems to just describe the human experience of falling in love, without drawing any interesting conclusions or making any hypotheses. I kept waiting for something to make me think or go ""aha!"". But after a few chapters I found myself wondering what the point of the book was, and getting bored as it drags on describing.Its style is also not my style, launching into a lot of description without enough examples. Those examples that are used are from literature and bible stories, which to me seem to further separate the book from reality. I would have been much more intrigued by stories or examples of real people.Maybe I missed something, but I just didn't see where it was going, and got too bored to continue."
2,A banal book about love...,"Maybe I shouldn't be reviewing this book, but I found it so boring I could not get into it. I found her observations about love to be trivial. Much of the discussion makes reference to Freud (one of the biggest quacks of the 20th century) and uses an intellectual tone to try to demonstrate unfounded generalities. Not very informative, not very interesting and not at all scientific."
2,Rivets Bulge,The knife has good looks as far as styling but isn't very comfortable to grip because the rivets are not recessed. this is the only knife I have ever seen that is made like this. They actually bulge from the handle. They should have recessed the rivets.Also for a knive maker with a reputation for excellence the finish on the blade was rather crude with spots that can't be removed without abrasives which would ruin the looks.I am not happy with this knife.
3,"Ok, But ear buds would be better","I bought these to go w/ my sony E507 mp3 player (which i love). I got it to use at the gym while working out, its anoying to have a long cord going to your pocket, and you cant get a good workout (arms) w/ a bicep band. I previously had a sony lanyard w/ the ear buds [MDR-NX1], it was great, but it eventually broke. So i decided to go a cheaper route and buy this product. It sounds good, is exactly what i need, but the earphones do not stay in your ear. Especially while working out, if i start to jump rope or hit the heavy bag, they fall out really quick. Now before you say that it shouldnt stay in while doing these things, my sony earbud [MDR-NX1] (little rubber pieces on the end) lanyard stayed in fine.+'scostsounddoes the job-'sdoesnt stay in the earNot that comfortable for extended wear.Save your money, but the sony MDR-NX1-J"
3,OK- Fits VERY specific sized and shaped ears,"I bought these first as a gift for my boyfriend. They didn't fit his ear-holes so I thought they were ""OK"" and kept them. They are just that ""OK"". They do fall out of my ears when I talk or move my mouth. **DO NOT DO ANYTHING CONDUCTING ELECTRICITY WITH THEM IN!** I frequently have them in while walking on the carpet and your ears get zapped because of the metal mesh on the earphones where they sound comes out. The magnetic surface on the lanyard is a unique idea that could use a little improvement, but the clip on the back of the magnetic surface is great to attach to a sleeve or collar. The option to use the longer cord is nice as well. I tend not to use the extension when working out with an MP3 player on my arm (the extra length isn't needed and not having cords bunched on your arm is quite nice). The ones I bought for my boyfriend in the end were the Twist-To-Fit and I found they were better for me."
1,keep fallen out,"i bought these as a second set to the wrap around model, i thought they would be good for around the house, boy was i wrong. Not only are they a mess to try and put on, but the ear piece's are huge, i'm a big guy with big ears and these are way to big. all they do is fall out. worst headphone ever......"
1,Too Big and Annoying,"Bought these for sporting purpose as i like to cycle and go to the gym weekly. Good sound but only stays in my ears for 30 seconds at a time. Cord is too short to have an IPOD in your pocket and the extension cord is too long to have in your pocket. I am not happy with them at all and i strongly recommend not to buy them, The CX500 is much better and more feasible for athletics or general use. Thank you - John"
4,Buy this book,"A wonderful history of the French and Indian War. Every once in a while Parkman seems to slant his story telling in a manner of his beliefs, but then, what author doesn't? Also, after reading many, many books on this time period, I have found that not all books agree on all points. Whether the others or Parkman is inaccurate, I do not know. In any case, for the price of this book, you are getting a bargain. For that matter, at any price it would be worth reading. For anyone interested in this time period, this is a book they will want to read. Even people who don't enjoy history could read this book as a novel and find it worth the reading. This is a book I am glad I didn't miss."
2,"Great Prose, bad information","While this book is a classic in American history it does not compare to modern histories. While Parkman selectively uses his evidence and omits key details the prose is very good. Overall though this book should not be used due to the inaccuracies. He also omits the contributions of the Indians which was a decisive factor in the war. See either Crucible of War, Empires at war or The Scratch of a Pen."
5,Margulis may be the greatest Photoshop expert of our era,"I've read two books and probably a dozen magazine articles by this guy (and look for new articles every month in various computer magazines). He's the only one who seems to know how to get Photoshop running on all 8 cylinders at once. This is a good Q&A book about what to do in all types of real life situations with Photoshop, often very simple concepts that seem revolutionary compared to the twirl-filter mentality of say, Deke McClelland (whose my 2nd favorite PS authority. Sometimes that twirl filter is handy)."
5,It doesn't get better than Madeline,"My 3-year-old-son LOVES Madeline books. This is one is definitely one of his favorites (and, I'll admit it, mine too).Of course Madeline is making Miss Clavel crazy by walking on the rail of the bridge (Since ""no one knew so well, how to frighten Miss Clavel""). When she slips and falls into the river, a brave dog saves her. The girls name her Genevieve and she becomes part of their school. More antics follow, with adorable pictures and clever rhymes. I read the voices of the board of trustees in a fake French, Maurice Chevalier-like accent just for kicks."
3,Madeline is back!,"Madeline is back with a dog in the heart of Paris! Nobody knows how quite to scare Miss Clavel, until Madeline tripped and fell. A dog keeps his head, and helps Madeline before she's dead (that's what it says, I'm not making it up). Of course, Miss Clavel allows the girls to keep the dog, and when Lord Cucuface inspects their house, it's goodbye dog, yet the girls search Paris until they find the dog. Unfortunately, an all-out war with pillows and brooms between the girls erupt: they each want the dog for their own. The battle ensues until the dog turns out to be a ""SHE"" and ""SHE"" has a present of her own for each of the girls."
5,"If you Love Beatles and Brass, you will love this CD!","I have played my CD no less than 100 times. Jens Lindeman plays the Picc solo on Penny Lane so precise and beautiful, it is hard to believe someone can play that high that well. Articulation and tonality for a Picc is superb. One of the best albums I have ever purchased. I saw them do this live and they are just as good live . Go get it!"
2,"Great Concept, Ho-Hum Results","I loved the idea of this album... until I actually listened to it. Most of the tracks sound like aimless noodling, especially the original material (the ""introductions"" to several songs). On the few tracks that are well-suited to a brass band, such as ""When I'm 64"", the results aren't bad, though. If only Canadian Brass had chosen to cover more appropriate songs--""Being for the Benefit of Mr. Kite"", perhaps, ""Because"", or even ""Only a Northern Song""--they might really have had something."
2,This CD is of low quality,"I believe that this CD is of low quality; Don't WASTE your money. Get another CD, like Canadian Brass Super Hits. Trust me, this CD is boring, and it some of the songs sound have no tune. It's just sounds. Believe me, this is the worst of the CB."
2,Huh...,Ok.Well I really don't get this book. It is kind of different but not something I would feel like reading...any day.
1,Gack!,"These ""softgels"" are super hard and have a rough texture that makes them very hard to swallow. They're the same size as the salmon oil capsules I've been taking for many years, but those have always been slick and go down easily. I'm going to find a previous brand and throw these away before I choke on one."
2,Lack of Color; not as advertised,"All advertisement of this video were in color, the jacket cover, label on CD and the enclosed literature are all in color. The description of the CD on the case states: 16.9 widescreen color. The version that I have received is all black and white and is definitely not as advertised. Is this the correct version or is this a manufacturer's mistake? I would like to return this BLACK AND WHITE copy as it is not enjoyable to watch and is not satisfactory.Thank you for your help in this matter.Philip Scalera"
5,It's like taking a trip to Israel.,"This is so fabulous. It is my dream to take a trip to Israel but was hoping I could find a travelogue that could give me a good idea of what it's like, not only the religious sites but the modern city. This is it. You will be astonished at what the Jewish people have done with this country. It is not only historic but modern and beautiful as well. I highly recommend it."
4,Visions of Israel,"Beautiful videophotography in Blue-ray format, and great narration. The content is not as strong as other Israel videos I have seen, but it has a distinction of being themost visually satisfying to watch."
1,Simply A Low Cost - High Margin Production,"The book is simply a cut and paste of old questions type of production. The layout was poorly presented, looks like the output from the '80s old fashion typewriter. Unlike other clep books, this one did not contain any study material of the subject matter, and only listed sample questions and answers (it does not provide explanation neither ??) The author gave a suggested book list, does it mean he wants us to buy and read the other five or six books and then take the questions? I am quite sure I will pass the clep by doing all these. It costs me some money, but not any more with this publisher....good luck shopping."
1,A Piece of Low Cost - High Margin Production,"The book is simply just a cut-and-paste of old questions, no more, no less. The layout was poorly presented. Feel like it produced from the 80's old typewriter. Unlike other clep books, it only contains suggested examination questions and answers (without explanation). The author only listed the suggested book list, and no materials about the subject was mentioned.Does it mean, we need to buy the other five books to study and then work on the ""questions"" he suggested? I am quite sure I will pass by doing all these. Good luck"
4,My sister was thrilled,I bought this as a gift for my sister who was thrilled. She has an arsenal of scents but this is her all time favorite. I'm old enough to know it's a classic. I as a man do not know much beyond that but as an Amazon customer I was particularly impressed with the always reliable service in terms of ordering and delivery which was very prompt.
2,Harley Davidson Data Book,This book has so much miss infomation you don't know what to believe.ie 1966 FLH first year info says fuel shut off is on the lower left tank. It's on the right tank. (the only year it was).There are many omissions like no production totals for 1965 FLH. These are just a few of many mistakes.
5,Fantastic Work,A great analysis of the Buffyverse for fans and non-fans alike. Riess has done an excellent job at deconstructing and spiritual and religious themes of Buffy. The interview with Eliza Dushku is particularly enlightening and fans of Faith will especially appreciate this book.
5,Christian Values in Sunnydale?,"Yes. I am a Christian. I became semi addicted to Buffy and it took me a while to figure out why.The show has all the elements of actual feelings/growing/exploration that normal kids go through. Spirituality is all through the book. What I liked best is that Good always wins over Evil. There is redemption, there is hope, and there is always a new dawn, with renewed hopes and dreams, just like in real life, sans the vamps and demons.(Although they are here, among us, but in human form - human monsters). We can hold on to our faith and pray that we would have the judgement and perserverence that Buffy shows, thanks to Joss Whedon."
5,Life-changing,"This was a wonderful book. I was almost expecting it to be goofy or worse, christian-based. Instead, it took the lessons Buffy taught us and applied them to life. The author pulled a lot from buddhism, which in turn led me to begin studying buddhism and try to follow its guidelines. I was happily surprised with this study of the show."
5,Great Quality!,"Love Grohe products! (grow'-eee) If you get this particular spout, like I did, you need a 4-way diverter. If you get the one with the pull-up opening, you can use the 3-way. Thanks to my plumber for that info!"
5,Great Tool,This is one of the best tools I have purchased......I have used it for Wood Panelling and furniture making. Creates great strong tight joints.
4,Needs clamp,"If you buy this jig, then spend the money to get the clamp that goes with it. I mistakenly thought that one of the various clamps that I own would fit this jig but wrong. Great little jig otherwise."
5,Kindkle,Kindle download...easy to purchase...description was very accurate........nice variety for gwtting books to download and I will contiunue to do so.
3,Disturbing,"David Chandler has made extensive use of the archives of S-21, with photographs and ""confessions"" to show the absurd paranoia of the leaders in Democratic Kampuchea. An excellent book, with some aspects that put me off, though: blunt anticommunism, some assertions about Soviet, Chinese and Vietnamese leaders that are rather anecdotal than based on serious historic scholarship, and weird comparisons between the turturers at S-21 and psychoanalysts."
1,The Series baseball did not want,The series was pretty bad in generall I dont believe I watched the Yankees were hevally favored and they were both in New York the only real exciting event in the series was the game where Roger Clemens through the bat at Piazza.Probally one of the 10 worst world series of all time no Fun at all.
3,HUH?,Are you people shrink wrapped? On the cover of the video tape it's full of skankees! Only one spot on the back has Mike Piazza. It even has only the Skankee symbol on the front. Being a diehard Mets fan I found it hard to buy because of that. Get glasses people!
5,Yanks Rule the Subway,"In the first Subway World Series since 1956, The Yankees show they are N.Y.'s team. Best games 1,2,and 5."
5,Perfect!,"As an inside joke between myself and another, I am the Fox, and I wanted a plushie just for the fun of it. The little guy is just perfect. It's not completely floppy, but it's not too firm either, just a perfect plush."
2,Not Pleased,"The plush toy received does not appear like that in the photograph. I searched and compared a number of different red fox plush toys in order to find just the right appearance. This one has a sweetness in its countenance, however, the toy delivered looks nothing like the photograph. Very disappointed."
5,Birthday Gift Purchase,I bought this plush fox for my daughter who just turned a year old. At this age she is fascinated with animals such as our cat and our dog so she naturally took to this toy and now it is one she carries around all the time. When it arrived it was a little bigger than I expected but that was a good thing because she uses this as a pillow during naptime often. Overall I was very happy with the purchase.
2,Not user-friendly,"I am returning this item because:-Proper names are not spelled in standard English forms (the publisher of this map is in Germany)-It is difficult to read the map - it is a topographic map, which is unnecessary and makes it difficult to find and read the cities, notes etc. printed in red.Even if one is familiar with the region it is difficult to find things on this map!"
3,Not without interest....,"Alfred Castner King has been described as a ""minor miner poet"". He began life as a miner, and took to poetry after losing his eyesight in an explosion. His work is quite uneven, but certainly includes highlights. Much appears to have been written in imitation of other poets. Much of ""The Passing Of The Storm"" resembles the work of Robert Service and may appeal to fans of the Bard Of The Yukon.The highlight of this particular volume is the title piece, an epic poem which fills a significant part of the book. The tale of a group of people brought together by a mountain storm, it's not only an interesting ballad but full of surprising character studies. On the frontier at the turn of the century, there were some interesting characters indeed!Not great art, but a nice look back in time, and interesting for the fact that it was written by a solidly blue-collar author who at best had an elementary school education."
2,I Got (the wrong) Rhythm,"This is one peculiar album.Darkest lowlight here has to be ALL of the Porgy & Bess selections-- every one of these is marred by a crummy electronic rhythm machine. ""It Ain't Necessarily So"" has been given an absurd samba beat! All of these elevator music tracks are bookended by adequately rendered orchestral versions of ""Rhapsody In Blue"" and ""An American In Paris.""Call this: ""Rhapsody in BOO!"""
4,good fit but...,"The return key is the wrong shape, the cover still fits, but it is a bit frustrating once you notice. If you have a MacBook, get a cover like this because replacing the keyboard is a lot more expensive and more of a hassle than it used to be. The entire upper case needs to be replaced if the keyboard goes. I'm happy enough with this cover to recommend it."
3,"It works, but doesn't fit perfectly.","It will protect your keyboard, there's no doubt about that. However, there seemed to be some minor disproportionality between this cover and my 2010 MacBook Pro's keyboard. There was a noticable lump in the material just below the space bar and the cover seemed to float a few milimeters above many of the keys. This space between the keys and cover made for awkward feeling typing. I would suggest theGTMax Silicone Keyboard Skin Coverover this product -- the GTMax product fits much more closely, looks better, and makes for a better typing experience than the Carapace Keyboard Cover."
3,Fits fine on the new MBP 13 inch but definitely interferes with keys,"Overall the product works as advertised but to be honest its a hassle to type with it on. I only will be using it when I am going to be doing web surfing, etc. Its a great concept and definitely keeps your keyboard clean but at a usability cost."
1,I couldn't even finish it.,"This book started off with great promise. Now, I've read and loved other books by Ms. Jordan, but I'm not sure where she went wrong with this book. I was fully involved with the hero and heroine - witty dialogue, chemistry jumping off the page ... but then when the book returned to England, it was like a completely new book started. The heroine changed from a take charge kind of person, to a wimpy 'I don't know what I want.' kind of person, and it just lost me as a reader. I put it down and moved onto something else. This book had great promise, but didn't live up to it."
4,"All in all, a very good book","I read this one a few months ago, and I liked it very much. Though I would not call it excellent, it is very good.The only thing that really annoyed me in the book was that the hero had the annoying habit of using sex to win the heroine over, rather than talking to her. All problems were solved with a quick roll in the hay, and she bought it hook, line, and sinker each & every time.I do have to say I was anxious to read about the American cousinNicolas, but since reading this book, I'm even more anxious to read about his friend, Lord Clune. But, I have 2 more (Estacy &Desire) to go before I can read Lord Clune's story.One more thing about this book -- there was one scene in particular, involving some playtime while riding a horse ... :)You will just have to read the book & discover this interesting passage for yourself! Let just say, for me, it was probably the steamiest scene in the book.1-10 scale: 9.7 Star scale: 4 1/2"
3,What a beginning but then.....,Great beginning...took off and then began to plod. The hero was great. Ms. Jordan is a wonderful writer but there were few twists and turns to sustain interest in the story. What held my interest was the change in the hero's personality over the course of the book and the engaging writing style of the author but it was a little disappointing. I still look forward to The Enchantment this summer; her writing style is charming.
3,"Hot sex, cold story",The story started out good enough. Lady Aurora sees Nicholas being beaten by his captures. He is facing execution for murder and piracy. Somehow she ends up marrying him to protect his half sister and launch his sister into the London ton. They have a passionate night of incredible lovemaking and the next day he is to be hanged. Well......of course that doesn't happen or it wouldn't be a love story. Nicholas shows up in England in the disquise of his cousin. People see the resemblence and few question. He wants his wife back..He is wanted by the English military...He needs to go back to America.. Too much of nothing happens...the end....
2,No spark. Fell flat.,"Where was the plot? What has happened to Nicole Jordan's flare, depth, emotion and unforgettable characters? Where's the excitement in that? The hero was way too soft! Throughout the whole book he did nothing but try to please the heroine. UGH! Leaves the hero unmanly if you ask me, more of a wimp. No conflict at all! The love scenes lacked PASSION only because there was no connection between the hero and heroine. Just a bunch of sex that didn't ""make it"" due to the lack of story and great characters."
2,Not up to par for Ms. Jordan,"This was a boring read, frankly. The hero & heroine make love too quickly in very beginning & then she spends the rest of the book making up excuses not to sleep with him again. Blah. I was skimming pages well before the end. Not what I expected from the author of THE SEDUCTION -- now, that book was GREAT."
3,Not Passionate about this read,I have really enjoyed the others in this series but this was at best lukewarm for me. I found the heroine annoying and cowardly. Nick was a good hero but I wish I could have seen more of him before he got his own story. There were moments when I was really enjoying myself and moments when i found myself skimming pages to get through it quicker.
4,Unusual to say the least ....,"Lady Aurora Demming marries Nicholas Sabine (our main man) on the eve of his imminent death: hanging to be precise. After the pre-requisite wedding night, Lady A never expects to set eyes on her deceased husband .... but boy is she wrong. Nicholas, Lady A's current husband, is thrown in the mix with an ex love/beau of Lady A, and all hell breaks loose ... so to speak.A story unfolds that is sweet, very sensual but also frustrating: frustrating because I am not fond of romance novels that pit hero against heroine in respect of affection and attraction for each other ... I find this rather frustrating.Overall, a very affecting novel (quite steamy sex scenes), interesting and worth a read."
1,boring,"Good god, The Passion was really hard for me to get through. It was so repetitive that I swear the internal dialogue for both H & H were cut and pasted over and over and over blah blah blah...! Don't waste your time on this book."
2,Not a keeper.,At the begining it was interesting but as I turned the pages it became boring and not original
5,"Social Realism meets gore, OK then...","Just when you thought it was safe to go into the video shop someone comes up with Dead Creatures. You'll get no synopsis from me, but lets say this slow burning slice of life at the coal face of zombiedom is pretty radical in that it doesnt rely on the well worn cliches we all know and love, but strikes out in a new direction.A worthy addition to the 'not a normal horror film' genre."
1,Bad,This movie sux's it looks terrible and doesn't play in my dvd player. Also they got the director mixed up...it's suppose to be by Fangoria!!!
2,Boring Creatures,"Several plain/plump looking women live together in an appartment. They talk a bit then go out, kill someone bring them home and butcher the body.They're compelled to survive on human flesh. They don't even get it on with each other, or their prey.And there's a sub-plot about some nut who captures creatures such as themselves and then tortures and kills them.Very little else happens in this film. Unless the 'everydayness' of this horror is meant to make some point, it's rather boring."
3,HE WAS THE KING BEE!!!,"This man influenced The Rolling Stones, The Beatles, The Blues Brothers and The Kinks....If you want a dose of the real stuff (BLUES)....""Raining In My Heart"" is it. Although Slim Harpo wasn't widely acclaimed as a singer, songwriter or musician by the public, other musicians were certainly aware of him. For a number of reasons, it's virtually impossible to properly document all of Slim ""James Moore"" Harpo's hits, this is truly one of the best ever released. Eventhough he died in 1970, this Blues Masters music will always be around. When you buy this package you're in store for some great stuff!!!"
5,The Second Coming of Christ,"This is an excellent, scholarly presentation of the historic Pre-Mill view of the second coming. Well worth the reading.Rev. Eugene Potoka"
5,Convincing and Authoritative!,"As a Christian raised in the Pre-Trib Rapture tradition, I thought I was losing my mind when I found myself becoming more and more convinced that the rapture of the church COULDN'T take place before the tribulation. I found a copy of The Blessed Hope and was so thoroughly convinced and put at ease that I have never questioned the subject again. Ladd's scholarship is awesome, especially his revelation of the seamy early history of pre-trib teachings. After reading where this teaching came from, its a wonder that anyone can believe it!"
4,Finally someone's making sense.,"The author is well-rounded in his theology - warning the church of the easy believism of a pre-trib rapture. This is my kind of book because he uses 'solid' scriptural reasoning to prove his points. If you're determined to believe in a pre or mid-trib rapture then this book is not for you, but if you want to read something that makes sense this is a good place to begin."
4,The Blessed Hope,"I think this is a good book to help prepare us for what will be happening in the near future. I used this book in college back in the early 1970's... the content of this book is timeless... it applies to any period... and we need to be ready for what we will be facing... this book helps point the way for those unsure about the Way, the Truth and the Life.M. Redding"
3,Nice ring but ouch!,"This is a beautiful ring, and I really liked it. Only problem is the stone fell out, and I chucked it int the woods oooopsie! Besides from that little mishap, very nice looking and exquisite design."
5,"fabulous product, definitely worth it!",This scrub is very gentle and doesn't irritate my skin like some other scrubs do. I use this once a week and my skin immediately feels unbelievably smooth! The texture of the scrub is also very pleasant.
4,"Not A ""How-to"" Book, But....","The author denies this is a ""How-To"" book, but if read with the same care that went into writing this learned volume, it is just that. She combines historical overviews with theory and practical advice. I would think this is required reading for anyone in business (and, one hopes, by government policy planners)."
5,Brilliant leadership book,"Sloan's critical distinction between strategic thinking and strategic planning is brilliantly developed throughout the book. Her writing is candid, her thinking is comprehensive and her concepts are thought provoking. Sloan is spot on with her analysis and discussion of why leaders fall short with developing innovative and sustainable strategy.This book should be compulsory for serious leaders of international business, government, and military.A brilliant read!"
5,"Wow - Naugahide, bakelite and bourbon pack less stink","Superb. This book makes me wanna head to the nearest dive bar, sink a few stiff ones and hop into my time machine -- destination: 1942. The only reason I don't is, well, time travel and booze don't mix. So I make due with By The Balls."
4,just great,"product delivered as expected. nice shoe, comfortable and attractive looking.are they gonna last 10 yrs? no. I did get what I was expecting and they are what I was looking for."
1,Quality worsens,"I bought these last week for $36- free shipping. Now they are $45. Anyway, I buy Saucony Jazz pair after pair. When I compared this pair with the old one, I've noticed how the quality of new ones worsened. Outside they look like they have been worn for a few months. Inside, the materials appears to be put together without any regard for the output. Uneven stitches, glue marks. When I tried them on, they are no longer the soft and cushioned sneakers I have enjoyed over the years. They are as hard as walking barefoot on hardwood floor or cement. I believe I was shipped the ""fake"" Jazz. I will see how I can return them."
3,Good shoe but very narrow,This is my first pair of Saucony shoes. I like the style as it is similar to the New Balance 574 that I have owned many pairs of in the past. Just wanted something different that not everyone has.I do have to say the shoe is extremly narrow. I recently have been buying shoes in a wide size if available. Wish these came in widths.
5,"Very nice shoe - retro style, modernly lightweight","Great shoe at a great price! Very lightweight, almost as light as Nike Free line, but for a fraction of the price and with retro styling. Can't wait to wear these! Prime shipping got them to me really quick - recommended!!"
4,Watch out for pinholes!,"The set up was quite easy; took the 2 of us a couple of hrs. Filling up with water took about 11 hrs. Our pool tilts towards one side where it is also abt 8"" deeper on one side. The filter works well and is quite powerful. The volleyball and net that come with it have been a hit with the kids. Ladder is a bit shakey but works. The only thing is that we discovered a tiny pinhole halfway up the wall. Of course this was after the pool was filled so although a repair kit came with it, we couldn't use it to stop the leak. We covered it up with duct tape which gets wet and doesn't quite stop the leak. We'll just fix it whenever we empty out the water."
1,junk junk junk,"The major problem withthis pool is the pump/filter system. Cartridge filters are inferior to sand filters to begin with, but this pump is too weak to circulate the water properly. It works fine if the water is clear to begin with, but if you leave for a couple of hot days and you come back to a green or cloudy pool, good luck getting it clean. You absolutely have to leave the pump running 24/7 and many of these pumps burn out in less than 2 seasons because of that. I would not be surprised if you have to shock the water 2 to 3 times per week, and that wreaks havoc on the vinyl. This pool is far more expensive and time consuming to keep clean than a regular above ground pool with a more powerful sand filter."
4,Status Quo - 'At Their Best' (St.Clair),"A great 24-track anthology of the long running UK band Status Quo.In ways,it's even better than their 'Singles Collection,1966-1973' 2-CD(see my review)because it's more direct AND to the point.Especially for the price,you simply cannot beat this deal here.Plus,there's at least seven cuts here that are not on the 'Singles...' 2-CD release.Most of these are quite good,like the Lemon Piper's cover ""Green Tambourine"",""Lazy Poker Blues"",""Do You Live In Fire"",""Daughter"",the psych gem ""Elizabeth Dream"",""Need Your Love"" and ""Spinning Wheel Blues"".For any fans who believe the Quo were simply a one-hit-wonder,you're half-right.In the states,they were.However,in the UK,they had a string of top ten hit singles.So there!Definitively a must-have."
3,Great Group / Poor Selection,"What else can you ask for that price??? Someone can ask, well that's why I rate it 3 stars. Eventhough, this boy can always rock with their heavy boogie sound. I think that maybe It can be call, ""At Their Best, The early Years"" or something like that. It is a good purchase for someone that knows Status Quo best works and want some of the eary reacords, but I don't recomend it to some that is beginnig with them."
5,"Gentle, old-fashioned, and whimsical.","This story by Jarrell is gentle, mythical, and stands the test of time. A short story about a solitary hunter on an island, who meets a mermaid, and together form a family with animals they meet. The tone is warm and soft, kind and at times bittersweet.While perfect for bedtime, cold or rainy days, this book is appealing to me even as i grow older. The subtle lessons about companionship, newness, differences, loneliness, loss, and joy are not forced to the fore. Rather, an old-fashioned sense of creating an environment as a way to tell a story is key here. Inviting wilderness, homely relationships, and just enough magic and mystery to compel the story forward.One of my most treasured books since i was a young child, the is a timeless and infinitely re-readable story."
5,My favorite book from childhood,"A librarian gave me a copy of The Animal Family as a birthday present one year, and it immediately became my favorite book.This story is so simply told, yet so beautiful that it has stayed with me all my life (30 years and counting since I first read it). I keep several copies of it so that I can give them away whenever I meet a special child who I think would appreciate it.You can read the other reviews if you want to know the story line... nothing can do it justice, however, except just reading it. When you start, you won't want the story to end, and when it does, you will be sad that the world - and relationships - aren't really as beautiful as they are in the book.This is an absolute MUST READ for any child. Or adult."
5,Buy this book before it goes out of print again!,"Whenever this book comes back into print I buy at least 6 copies. I traditonally give this book to children I cherish on their 5th birthday; it must be read TO them, but they love it. (I have a first edition that was given to me when I turned 5.) I also give it to couples as a shower gift; ""The Animal Family"" is an excellent book about love and marriage. This book seems to go in and out of print frequently--buy it while you can!"
1,Errors and no comedy,"I have read very little if any, of William Shakespeare since my school days which seems to long ago to mention. I thought I would like to try some comedy. Unfortunately this book was just to difficult to read and understand. I had to give up half way thru it."
4,accessible,"this is shakespeare's most accessible comedy. it's a farce about mistaken identities among identical twins. nothing complicated here. the play has it's funny moments. it's not the bard's best comedy; that's 'much ado about nothing', imho. but this is not a bad place to start."
3,Pleasant Broadway score.,"I was surprised how well this score plays on CD nowadays. The songs reveal character and tell the story. The show wasn't a big hit, but was enjoyable; especially for a young soldier on leave ! The magnificent Louise Troy shines here, especially in ""I'll Make a Man of the Man."""
2,Couldn't get past the boring format...,I only read the first two chapters. The format was very dry and hard to read. This book was not what i was hoping it would be. I hope there are other books about the Montessori approach that aren't as bland.
4,Best tool for your sea-doo watercraft repairs!,"Overall, a very powerful and concise manaul that details complete service, maintenance and other repair issues for sea-doo watercraft. Like many other Clymer manuals, it gives you great pictures and easy to read descriptions to get you through the toughest situations. It's such a small investment in comparison to what I could have spent taking it to the shop each time it broke down! -- I highly recommend this book to anyone needing a repair manual for sea-doo watercraft!"
4,Well worth the money,"I am new to the whole PWC thing and recently purchased two used Sea-Doo's Both are 1996 GSX's, which are agile and very quick. I had a problem with one of the units that left me stranded for a few hours forcing me to tow one unit with the other. I attempted to find out why the unit had just stop working and found that I had no spark. I was forced to take the unit to a dealer for service which cost me 3 weeks of usability and $700.00. If I had just purchased the book, I could have paid only the $250.00 for the part and been done with it. I now own the manual and the dealers will not take me for a ride anymore! The book is more than enough information to help fix any problem you may have as well as just tune the system a bit. The only requirement is some common sense. After being taken to the cleaners by the dealers or before, buy the manual!"
5,Get this if you have an older SeaDoo!,"This shop manual is a must if you want to know how to properly diagnose, maintain, and repair your older SeaDoo. I have a 95 SPX and this manual has saved me a lot of money doing stuff myself."
5,Everything you need,"This is a very complete manual, similar to a Chiltons or Motor's manual for automotive."
3,For class,Bought this book for class. The professor only used it about 5 times throughout the semester. Didn't even assign homework from the text. Bleh
3,For those students with Geography,This was an easy book to use and read. Your teacher may want you take this book are another edition. It has nice pictures.
3,As a text,"The general feel of this book is dark and dull. Graphics are oddly benign,upside, the Geography in Action sections offer realistic insight into Geographic concepts. Clawson and Fisher tried."
1,WTF?,"First off, it came in a beat up binder with the name ""Valerie Karney"" scribbled on the inside. The whole thing looked a mess. Not even all of the pages were put in properly. It was as if a mentally challenged person attempted to assemble this book."
2,Bored to Tears,"I'm currently taking World Geography and we're using this book. Honestly, I read half of the first chapter, and I was almost bored to tears. It comes across as extremely wordy, and it takes a chapter for them to explain a concept that could sufficiently be said in a few sentences. However, I didn't read the whole book, so perhaps it gets better as you read along."
1,Seriously Biased,"The tendency of this book to ridicule America (its history, its culture, its priorities, etc.) really calls into question the objectivity and political persuasion of its authors. Whether it's the destruction of the environment or world poverty, America and the American people are always to blame. We use too much energy; we don't share enough; blah blah blah. America does more to promote peace and economic development throughout the world than any other country. While the authors of this book don't seem to be so, I, for one, am PROUD to be an American"
1,"Fast, Furious, but nevertheless fearless.","References were readable but lacked depth, width and a modicum of height. However overall clarity was sharp with only bluntness at the edges. Whilst all the comments were pertinent was the pertinence too compartmentalised or too open? Dang me if I didnt just whoop and holler at finding the late neo-classicists described as New Classic Latecomers"
4,Great remixes!,"The Mojo Club is a danceclub in Hamburg, Germany specialising in live and DJ'd jazz/easy listening. This successful venue has put out a series (last I checked, there was eight of them) of compilation CDs with artists ranging from Marvin Gaye to Quincy Jones to Nina Simone to Ella Fitzgerald.Popular with the beat-jazzhead-downtempo group (Kruder & Dorfmeister, Rainer Truby, Shantel, et al...), they've put out this remix album featuring some great downtempo remixes of jazz/pop standards.Beginning with a great danceable Rockers Hi-Fi remix of ""Sunshine of Your Love"" the album ventures into sticky beats (a la Beanfield, Baby Mammoth), tripped-out psychedelia (the Shantel Mix of ""For What It's Worth""), and downtempo (Nightmares on Wax's ""Les Nuits"").If you're into the whole Kruder & Dorfmeister thing, you will probably like this. If you're looking for fresh takes on standards, you'll probably enjoy it as well."
1,cracked keychain/sticker ruined it all,"Hello- I bought 2 bad kitty keychains for $4 bucks each, they arrive with a huge price label on both, impossible to remove. SO basically, only one side of the keychain was cute, the other side was gross- DUH! Why would they do that ! FRUSTRATING"
2,Opinion!!!,Well This item sure fooled me! I thought i was buying 2 12inch subs in a box and it only came as one!! maybe you should take that picture off and put a single one up
4,A scary proposition,"I don't recall a time in US history when the assets of the Executive Branch are being used to create what comes close to a theocracy. When I pay taxes, I expect the money to be used in nonsectarian ways.Goldberg's book documents how federal funds have been used to foster a religious agenda. This is wrong and Goldberg points this out in a factual way. It is exactly what the Islamic fascists are doing. What is the difference?"
3,I'm no Kid,Her book is decent but it often feels incomplete or empty. Some of her hate shows in it too so theres some bias. It would be a better book if she got rid of these things and if she was a little more rational.BUT! Shes sooo cute
1,SanFran lefties world view,"Kingdom Coming: The Rise of Christian Nationalism and The Means of Reproduction: This book is just another piece of left wing paranoia, which no doubt propelled the author upwards in the dizzy heights of SF cultural elitist circles (if that's where she lives).Oh! these awful Christians. The Christians who founded the country.The Christians and their Pastors who fought against the British, and the liberal 30% of their countrymen, to found a new and better land. The Christians who carefully crafted a Constitution, so that useful idiots like this author, could avoid having to live in a tyrannical society.As America goes down the same God rejecting road that Russia and Germany already traveled, replacing God with the all-seeing all-knowing, omnipresent, omniscient ""Godvernment"" we will no doubt see, and are already seeing a slide into Socialism, whether Hitlerian or Stalinist, or even Maoist, or Obamian, we shall see! This book is your guide."
1,Interview short on facts,I just heard the interview also. It sounded like just a bunch of goofy left-wing anti-Christian conspiracy theories to me. Terry Gross was sucking it up and not asking any tough questions. Just go watch the Da Vinci Code instead.
3,"worth reading, with a grain of salt","Yes, its worth reading. But as Goldberg herself warns, the ""Christian Nationalists"" she describes in her book are hard to refute ""without sounding shrill and hyperbolic."" Goldberg has, to her credit, talked to a significant portion of the people she talks about. Her research was not all academic: she visited megachurches and christian policitical rallies, and talked with ""grassroots"" conservative Christians. However, she only mentions one conservative Christian who sees the same problems she sees within evangelicalism, while I strongly suspect there are more she could have mentioned to provide more balance. She also preens far too much about being ""cosmopolitan"" and ""urban."" I would suggest to Goldberg that those are accidents of birth and education just as much as conservativism and ruralism, of which she speaks with such unmasked disdain. Unmasked disdain is the real flaw in Goldberg's book. It is difficult to take someone seriously who is so obviously angry."
4,Audacious,"It seems our good, pious neighbors are conspiring to take over the world. Even if I thought spreading Christianity was a good idea, it would not be the Christian Fanatics's version. I recently read; ""Holy War is the result of the believers of one religion killing the believers of another religion over who has the better imaginary friend."" The Christian Right would tear down the wall of separation of Church and State and make this country a ""Christian Nation""""As our founding fathers intended"". They obviously have not done their homework in U.S. History. Their brand of tyranny is exactly what the founding fathers were protecting us from when they passed the 1st Amendment to the Constitution. This book should be read by everyone who wants to keep the right to their own beliefs."
1,Unoriginal,"Goldberg's book is nothing but secular-leftist paranoia. It offers nothing new, but rather reaffirms the preconceived anecdotal ideas of the secularist.Goldberg should limit her writing to opinion pieces, because the lack of research and knowledge she displayed in this book is evidenced by her confusion over theological ideas and misconstruing political movements in history.This was not a book that deals with honest research, rather Goldberg wrote a propaganda piece that vilifies a group of people who oppose her ideological beliefs."
1,A Young Woman from Outer Space Visits Middle America,"This book is a left-wing, ultra-liberal polemical diatribe that was written by a young woman who, while a college student at SUNY Buffalo, seems to have overdosed on Hannah Arendt's book about the rise of Nazi totalitarianism in Europe and thinks it is happening here because of the Bush Administration. She did not, apparently, take American History 101, with the result that she exhibits no knowledge or understanding about religion in American history and grossly exaggerates the importance of today's Christian fundamentalist movement in America politics. Her suggestions about what the liberal left must do politically to prevent America from becoming a Christian Nation are truly hilarious. A terrible book, disjointed, repetitive, rambling, much in need of a good editor. Anyone who buys this book will be wasting his money. It adds absolutely nothing to the sum of our knowledge about Christian fundamentalism in America today."
5,A book so good ... I am bleeding at the palms,"A note if anyone gives this book a one star, and mentions ""liberal"" or ""left"" in their review that is code for the book obviously being the truth. Not just a mere POV, but reality. Goldberg hits it on the nose with this one."
5,The Bible of Music Copyrighting,"This is the Bible of music copyrighting and licensing. With the coming of age of the Internet, transferring copywritten information online will become increasingly in the spot light and this book makes sense of it."
3,"Good gun, bad charger","Bought this for my son, plugged the battery pack in to charge, 10hours later still dead. Had an electrician check the charger - no output, bought a new one - gun works great - has to be reloaded often because of limitation of cartridge"
5,Cool,A Xmas gift not much else to say lots of cool gadgets and stuff in it I am sure my nephew will like it
5,very good,"I found this particular gun to be made very well for the price it was sold. It also shoots great. It came a little late but all in all it was worth it. I spent a whole day chasing my brother with it, and it was pretty dead on."
3,cheap but ok gun,"this guns is cheap its made out of plastic and will break. but while it was working it shot at a great speed on fully automatic and it hurt. but when it does break its hard to open up and fix it if your looking for something just for fun to mess around with this is good, if your looking for something for an airsoft war get something metal."
3,Upgrade?,"though i have to say its good if you play in your backyard but you may want to give it upgrades because it is first and foremost, plastic, second, it only has a 280 FPS so I recommend buying a new gearbox AND spring to bring this gun to a well needed 350 FPS other than that The only problems are that the BB's jam the mag by sticking just below the chamber, the wind up mag will cut out (unwind) after a lot of shooting and needs to be wound as your shooting, Last thing the suppressor is only for the wall display, why because it keeps the BB's from shooting straight and is not meant to silence the gun at all! The reason i say that is because everyone who buys a gun that includes one in the package thinks that it works like a real one, IT DOESN'T!"
3,CM .023,"The day I got this gun, I took out the scope, it was broken. I charged it for 12 hours like it said, the sample BBs went somewhat far. This is a terrible gun for regular airsoft, you need to be close quarters for a guy to even feel it. it goes about 50 feet, not very accurate. The low capacity mag is great but runs out quick, the high capacity mag is great, it looks really cool, haven't had to recharge it yet, and after you get this I strongly reccomend upgrading the ROF and FPS on it. I wouldn't get this if you don't have another gun, OK sidearm."
1,WORST GUN EVER,"I bought this gun thinking it was a good one. when it arrived i tried it and it seemed okay.after about 2 weeks the stock broke, it wouldnt fire and the flashlight shut down. I would reccomend it to no one."
1,Unsatisfied,This item looked cool but it never worked correctly. Made cheaply. Difficult time with getting my refund upon return. Poor customer service!
4,Pretty good,first id like to say im new to airsoft so dont take my word for it .It is a cool gun the high cap. magazine doesnt really matter beacause once the bbs get to a certain point they dont shoot becuz the bbs stay in the magazine so thats kind of a waste moving on.the elctri crosshair scope isnt very accurate but anyway overall i like even though i have only had it 4 a day.Shipping and handling are kindof expensive. 8.95 for S&H and it took a full week to get here on standard shipping
4,Great gun for the price.,"I bought this gun off amazon.com, and i think it is a great gun for the price. It's not the best gun you can have, but it works out as a great side arm. It has a great hop up. The scope that comes with it is holographic, which means that you can only see it if you're looking through the scope. It comes with two clips, one is a hi-cap magazine with 110 rounds, and the other is a low-cap mag that holds 20 rounds. They're both great.I think that it goes around 250-290 fps, depending on the charge of the battery. It's a 7.2 volt battery, and lasts long.If you are using this gun on the battlefield, you should most likely bring another gun. It is quite accurate.I reccomend this gun, whoever is looking for an LPEG."
4,Best assault rifle,I just got this gun yesterday. The shipping said 3-5 business days but mine came in six. But it was worth it because i had a war the day i got it. This is one of my favorite automatic airsoft gun I have. It is a very very good gun. It has a great fire rate and it shoots very far plus it comes with an adjustable hop up that works. I shot my friend from fifty feet away in the goggles. It is very accurate. Also it has a semi automatic option as well as an automatic. Now the bad things. The shipping costed a little too much. The silencer doesn't do anything except make the range worse. The first day you get it it says to charge it for 12 hours. I charged mine for one hour (which i know is probably bad for the gun) but it is still working on me. All in all it is a very good gun. This gun is definitely worth the money. This isnt for someone who just plays airsoft one month or anything like that. I play often. VERY GOOD GUN. cya next time
1,"Caution, Not rated to 22 Degrees!","The ""Limite Comfort"" stated in the bag is 32 degrees. Of course I found this out the hard way camping out in Gunnison (Coldest City in Colorado). Where it dropped around 30 during the night and about froze my boys off if you know what I mean. I returned it and was promptly refunded."
1,This is a bootleg.,"How this got listed on Amazon I will never know, but ""Queen - Magic Years"" has never been officially or legitimately released on DVD anywhere in the world. It has only ever been issued on VHS and laserdisc. This listing if for a pirated or bootlegged copy and assuming the seller can even produce a copy of it, it will certainly be nothing more than a DVD-R. If you are interested in owning this release (which is excellent), track down the VHS release or, if you are insistent on owning it on a DVD-R, you can find this bootleg elsewhere online for far, far cheaper than $299.99."
5,This is a great CD,"This CD sounds great to me. The New World Symphony sounds wounderfullto me. Occasionally, I have heard heard bits and pieces of thisSymphony on television, radio and at a friends house. So It can besaid that I don't really know this symphony, but it sounds great to me.In 1893 Dvorak said this symphony was Czech music but in the years since hesaid that, I think it has become American music.The second piece on this CD, ""Romance for Violin and Orchestra"" is totallynew to me. But I thought it sounded wonderfull.I compared the Carnival Overture with the one on ""Dvorak in Prague:a Celebration"" (ASIN: B000001VQ2). The Carnival Overture sounds slightlybetter on this CD because the one on Dvorak in Prague has some extranioussounds in it.I highly recommend this CD."
4,"Solid, common-sense advice and a couple of secrets","The author gave a good covering of landlording topics. Most of it was common sense information, but there were a couple of little treasures thrown in. The advice on handling troublesome tenants was interesting, but I have never needed it (so far!). For the beginning landlord, this will provide a wealth of information on topics you may not have considered. For the experienced landlord, there might be a few nuggets of gold, but don't expect a bonanza."
3,Stick with the original,"I've owned the original Airzooka for close to five years now and it is still as much fun as it ever was. I purchased the Megazooka about sixteen months ago, expecting a great improvement on an already great toy, but was disappointed. The capacity is the same on both, so you don't get any more power with the Megazooka. The extended sight is a joke and the overall size of the thing makes it quite unwieldly. The trigger mechanism works just fine, but my recommendation would be to buy two regular Airzookas for the price of one Megazooka; I guarantee you'll have more fun that way."
3,Fun,"This took a few minutes to put together. We managed to break a corner off the ""scope"" piece but it's still fully functional. Kids and adults enjoy blasting others with it and it's not unpleasant getting blasted by it."
4,fun upgrade,"We bought the original airzooka a few years ago and had ""a blast"" with it. I thought this would appeal to the boy in my now-grown sons and I was right. It brings out the kid in anyone. What fun it is to blast someone's hair straight up! Especially prissy grandma!"
1,The assembly takes away all the fun,"Sounded like a fun toy. So, I bought two. I received them one hour ago, and have spent the last hour trying to assemble them (the first one, actually). The instructions are unclear. The notation on the gun for assembly is confusing. I've put together dozens of IKEA furniture pieces. But this item makes the worst IKEA piece feel like a piece of cake. Creative idea. But the manufacturers forgot that we are not all engineers. I still can't get it to fit together. No clear indication of alignment, etc. I AM RETURNING THE PRODUCT. Come on... it couldn't have been that hard to ship an assembled piece, OR... put a line down the alignment center so the customer didn't have to guess."
4,overall good phone w/ a few problems,"I used to have a K700i which I loved, and was excited to get this new Sony phone. However, I have three complaints: 1) the buttons are pretty small, and I don't have huge hands; 2) the part of the phone you speak into is not on the bottom, but just below the keys, so if you hold the phone against your cheek you sound very muffled; and 3) the screen just goes blank in screensaver mode, so if you leave and come back you can't tell from looking at it if you missed any calls or messages. update: you can press one of the buttons on the right side of the phone to get the time and show if you missed a call or text."
2,promising phone but under delivered!,"I am very tech savvy when it comes to cell phones, and I must say the 550i looked very promising on paper: Quad Band, bluetooth, 2.0 MP camera with xenon flash, etc. But when I got the phone and placed the sim card, I noticed the antenna reception is far inferior to some other phones I have used, such as Nokia N73, or even Sony Ericsson K750i. I would routinely get ""no reception"" and would take the phone quite some time to pick up reception again. Other than the antenna issue (which is a big deal) the other features and functionality of the phone are superb. Nice tactile feel to the buttons, the menus and submenus can be accessed in a flash with minimal lag time. The software on the camera is not quite as user friendly as the K750i and i feel the picture quality is not as good either (even though k750i also has a 2 MP camera). Had I known what I know now, I would decline to purchase this phone again"
5,great service,"great service, i recomend seller. the only things with this item (nothing to do with seller) is that the buttons are sensetive, the internet browser opens up easily(while in pocket), to unlock the keypad is tricky, phone isnt really user friendly. phone gets great signal, speakers work great, camera works above average for a cell phone, will work with verizon, at@t (formally cingular), sprint, and alltel."
4,solid cell phone,"CONS:buttons are a little too narrow. txting is sometimes a little counterintuitive. if you buy the international version, then it's difficult to get the network up and running. I still haven't gotten mine up and I've followed through with customer service's directions.PROS:Nice candy bar shape. Sleek. Good quality camera pics. No lag in the operating system (compared to SLVR). Makes/takes calls. Good amount of features."
4,"Nice book, with a wonderful ending.","Mystery and romance woven very well into a good read!! Sela afraid to love thinking ""a curse"" has been placed on her. The author weaving nice clues leading to an explosive conclusion. Ben being the man to break the barrier to Sela's heart and help her overcome her fears. Wonderful book."
5,Love it!,"This liner makes cleaning the oven so much easier. You just cut it to fit your oven and when it starts to get dirty, wipe it clean with a damp cloth. It's that easy."
1,"After A Year, Garbage",We barely use the oven and prefer the toaster oven 75-80%. I've cleaned the mate a few times. After a year it became brittle and scattered with holes. I threw it out. Now I line with foil.
1,"BEWARE, Stanco non-stick Oven Liner","I am a member of an exotic bird club and just recieved this email.""I've been contacted by a man who lost both his Congo African Grey and Moluccan Cockatoo several hours after using a product his wife purchased from a Miles-Kimble Catalogue. The product is Stanco non-stick Oven Liner. After posting this info to my bird club, I was contacted by one of my members telling me she had a friend who used this and lost several of her birds!"".Apparently there is NO warning on the lable."
4,Good Oven Liner,The first time I used my gas oven with the Stanco Oven Liner it smelled a bit. Now it is fine and very easy to wipe off if something spills. Much easier than cleaning the oven!
3,"Useful, but ...","I'd like to give it 3 1/2 stars. It does the job it's meant for, and that's an excellent thing. But the first few times I used it, the kitchen smelled like burning rubber. Fortunately, the food in the oven tasted fine."
1,Eh...not so good,"I bought this 3 months ago, always kept it on the lower oven rack, not on the bottom of my gas oven. I hand washed it when dirty. Now it is cracked, and a white color around the cracks, it has holes in it, looks horrible, and it's no longer protecting my oven floor. It's getting tossed out. The concept is good but it's a flimsy product, not worth the $$."
2,"""For gas ovens place liner on lower rack"" -- FAIL!","First off, the product dimensions are not ""18 x 4.5 x 4.2 inches,"" as stated in the item description. The sheet is 23 x 16.25 inches and the thickness of maybe two sheets of copier paper. Pretty flimsy. The instructions on the box say that for gas ovens, you shouldn't put the liner on the bottom of the oven. Instead it should go on the lower rack. Which seems pretty ridiculous, especially in a convection oven. (The instructions also misspell ""visible"" as ""visable."") Rather than take a chance on this thing melting, it's going in the trash."
1,What a disaster!,"I bought this, followed directions to a T, and ended up with a mess! The first time I used the oven after installing this, I was making cookies, so the temperature of the oven was somewhere in the ballpark of 350. Within a few minutes of putting the cookies in, I smelled a horrible smell and went to investigate. I opened the oven and black smoke filled my kitchen. The liner was on FIRE and it smelled like burning plastic. I had to throw the liner and my cookies away. It took days for the smoke smell to leave my house and I was afraid to finish baking the rest of the batch of cookies in the oven because of the plastic chemicals in the oven. What a disaster! Talk about a waste of money---I now have no liner, am out the price of the liner, and lost some cookies. I still am not sure why it caught on fire, because nothing was touching it and the oven was not that hot. If I could give this zero stars, I would. One star seems too kind."
1,disapointed!,"I had high hopes for this oven liner, however, the first time I heated my oven to 450 degrees, the liner stuck to the oven floor and melted. Now there is a large hole in it. I threw away the packaging as soon as I got the liner, so I don't think I can return it. On a brighter note, the liner fits well and looks nice. I just wish it worked as well as it looks. I can not recommend this item."
3,"its ok, BUT","If you've got an electric oven--where the element is at the bottom--and want to use two racks (for instance a roast and vegetables/potatoes on a cooking sheet), to quote the well-known Bugs Bunny: You've got troubles, Mac. You cannot put the liner on the bottom if the electric element is there. The instructions tell you to use a rack at the bottom of your oven. OK if you are cooking using one rack and the other one is available. If not, well there's a fall-back position: Oven Cleaner!"
5,very good singer,This women can sing very good and I recomend this to people who need to take a load off.
3,A forgetable CD,"This is a professional production; nevertheless, it would have suited my tastes better back in the late 1960's or early 70's--that is the style of this CD in my view. It seems okay; but nothing special, and if I had heard it before ordering it, I wouln't have ordered it."
4,Excellent DVD,"This DVD covers the subject of bass fishing very well, but there are a couple of omissions which should be corrected. The most glaring omission in my opinion was the subject of fishing line. No where on the DVD is this covered in regard to test of line or color or whatever. Also there is no coverage of the different species of bass. One assumes that largemouth black bass is the primary subject of the DVD however. A short section might have been devoted to where these lunkers hang out too. Despite these omissions the topic is covered very well and even the long term fisherman can glean a lot of material through viewing it."
1,Claudia sucks....,"Claudia Leitte is really quiut, but her music totally sucks...I mean, the songs are all exactly the same with different lyrics...and the lyrics are ridiculous...even a 11 year girl can write better lyrics...this is the kind of plague that destroyed many young brains in Bahia...BEWARE! Stay far away from this stupidity, or it will melt your brain!!!!"
1,THIS BOOK ISNT WORTH IT!,"Please dont think for a second that you might want this book! Its information is tottally wrong! Names are [messed] up, family relations dont even make sense,the episode guide was 44% wrong, very biast and inncorrect character reveiws. Dont belive the other reviews on this page saying [stuff] like ''I know every character like someone in my family!'' or the really funny one ''this book was really helpfull.'' If you wanna learn something correct and really cool go to some fan sites .... Then you'll find some helpfull info."
3,I remember this,"I remember this book....oh so long ago....(01 or 02) in Jr. High when Gundam Wing ruled most of my time and life....I admit the information sucked (it was written by a bunch of sniveling fan girl five year olds it seems) but I think I bought it for ""show off"" and art purposes.... Yeah, the information sucked, but I loved the pictures!!!! Brings back fond memories!"
3,Hahahaha!,"The only reason I got this book is for the many pictures. Most of the information is incorrect as a 12 year old reader from Millbury, OH said. When it says ""Unofficial"", they really mean ""We made this up"". The only nice stuff about this book is the pictures from Universal Century and the modeling section written by C.T. (Core) Chin of www.newtype-asylum.com. Definatly a site to check out. Anyways, I am gonna wrap this up with: If your new to Gundam Wing and looking for some great information, DON'T BUY THIS BOOK. But if your looking for some nice pictures from UC then I would pick this book up..."
5,awesome facts!! ///-^ (it's Trowa!),"This book is really good. I suggest it for any fan of (ok long list here...) Mobile Suit Gundam, Mobile Suit Z Gundam, Mobile Suit Gundam: Char's counterattack, Mobile Suit Gundam 0080:War in the Pocket, Mobile Suit Gundam F-91, Mobile Suit Gundam 0083: Stardust Memory, Mobile Suuit V Gundam, Mobile Suit Gundam: The 08th MS Team, Gundam Wing, Endless Waltz (Gundam Wing), Mobile Fighter G Gundam, After War: Gundam X, Turn A Gundam, and (finally) Mobile Suit Gundam ZZ. Again way cool pics, 3D section and pretty good info. A must have for any Gundam.............................. fan"
5,Just Like Mom Used to Make,"My Swedish wife raves about this book because the desserts in it are just like her mom used to make like Swedish Ginger Cake and Dreams cookies. When her mom has visited us she's also enjoyed checking it out and baking from it. The recipes are easy, but the only downside is there are no pictures. We haven't experimented much with the non-dessert recipes."
1,useful device,"I picked up one of these thinking I'd have any easy way to copy my band's demos and make our own CDr albums, but to burn without multiple unlistenable errors you have to copy slow at 4x and I have had problems even with that. The unit is being returned to the manufacturer for warranty service - they have been responsive - so hopefully it is just an easy repair. (Sep 13, 04)Alera replaced the writer and upgraded the firmware. So far it seems to have corrected the problem! Hopefully I can get some use out of this now without worrying about errors, in which case, this rocks... (Oct 15, 04)I've had almost no issues since the fix above. working well 3+ years on now...(Feb 28, 2008)"
3,The Lone Rider and Fuzzy to the rescue,"This is a better than average entry in the PRC ""Lone Rider"" series starring George Houston and Al ""Fuzzy"" St. John. George and his sidekick Fuzzy arrive in town dressed as guitar strumming dudes which throws off the townfolk. The tough hombres in town order George and Fuzzy to get out of town, but they refuse to leave.The sheriff is in on the duo's secret and soon George (the Lone Rider) and Fuzzy are out bringing the outlaws to justice. There's more singing and comedy than assorted violence in this little horse opera, which sets it apart from the average Poverty Row Western. Also, Alpha's film transfer is not great, but it is watchable."
4,Daniel for Practical Application,"There are two ways one can approach the Book of Daniel. One can ignore the stories and focus on the prophecies in chapters 2 and 7-12, looking for explanations in history. This jigsaw puzzle approach to the Book of Daniel does not help one to live a better life. But, I must confess, that that was the approach I was looking for when I bought the book. I got so much more out of it as I studied Daniel's uncompromising life of prayer. Dr. Ferguson does not ignore history nor fail to indicate what events the prophecies refer to when this is clear, but much more important than that is the lesson that God is sovereign over history. He is in control. We can either, like Daniel, seek after God's in obedience or, like the kings of Babylon, go against His plan in a rebellion that is doomed to fail."
5,Must have,Best commentary on Daniel I have ever read. Any pastor or teacher needs this vol. It is well written and easy to understand
1,Extremely disappointing,"I'm a huge Mets fan and was really excited to watch the highlight film to relive my childhood memories, but this video is poorly produced and falls way short of expectations as I don't think they had the rights to most of the TV broadcasts, therefore you get none of the commentary from the actual games.Instead half of the video is of the fans reactions in the crowd, poor camera angles (most of the hitting clips are from the side angle like if you wanted to see if there was a check swing) and even a few shots of a PanAm flight as they call the 86 series, the Shuttle Series?!?! There are only a few sound bites from the actual players and the rest is Vin Scully narration which is always solid but I would have liked more from the players and actual commentators - you don't even get the classis call on Mookie's grounder. Take a pass on this video..."
2,falling way short,"This video fell way short of my expectations. The drama and excitement of the series was lost due to continuous 3rd party narration instead of the live ""play by play"" coverage. Also, camera shots from the dugout that show home runs by Carter and Henderson along with other clutch hits just don't do it for me. Disappointing."
4,Vin Scully,"Want to make a Red Sox fan angry and physically ill at the same time? Say ""A little roller up along first . . . behind the bag . . . it gets through Buckner! Here comes Knight! And the Mets win it!"" in your best Vin Scully impression."
2,just not comfortable!,"This comforter is no doubt alergy safe, however it is not at all comfortable. The material on the outside feels like the stuff that a camping tent is made out of, though the tag says that it is 100% cotton. While the fabric is very tight so as not to let any feathers go through, it also doesn't let any air through either. You end up sweating under the blanket or freezing with it off. Also, it is not very generous with the stuffing. It is only about an inch and a half thick, which it fails to mention in the product description. I plan to return mine and next time not be so idiotic as to buy it online without seeing any reviews."
5,Love it,"I adore this comforter and would like to get it in other colors. It's not thick, but it doesn't need to be because it is so warm! It's the warmest and cosiest comforter that I've ever owned."
3,comforter,"I was a little dissappointed with this comforter, It just wasn't what I thought it would be, it's ok, but not great, the color was exactly what I wanted, it just could of been more plump I guess you would call it."
3,Not Free SF Reader,"The children from the first Narnia book return there to find that many centuries have passed in Narnia time.Those who were once boss types in Narnia have to solve a bit of a usurpation problem, with the aid of a couple of characters, including the old fleabag himself, Aslan."
4,Great action,"Prince Caspian is one of the tales of The Chronicles of Narnia. It takes place after Peter, the high king and his siblings left the kingdom many years before. They returned to find animosity between the realms of prince Caspian and the magical creatures. A knight called Reepicheep that is a talking mouse, a dwarf and the cast off prince find themselves on the same side as the high king Peter and his siblings. After they learn to trust each other, they unite to bring peace to all races and the throne to his rightful heir. A great tale full of action.Anna del C.Author of ""The Elf and the Princess""The Elf and The Princess: The Silent Warrior Trilogy - Book One (The Silent Warrior Trilogy)"
4,Great Story,I think that C.S. Lewis was one of the best storytellers of his time. The movies so far are fairly good as well. Try TheNarniaAcademy dot org for a really good accompanying study for the book (the entire academy is free). They work extremely well together.
5,Prince Caspian is a classic,this book is a classic for all children hungry for an adventure. I know that there was a movie i thought that the book was a ***** star and the movie a **** star.
4,return to Narnia with action,"In this the fourth book in the Chronicles of Narnia, the four children from The Lion, The Witch, and The Wardrobe return to the magical land of Narnia to find things greatly changed from the way they left them. A young king is on the run from his uncle who seeks to usurp the throne and the four children, who are kings and queens of Narnia themselves must battle a new foe and restore Old Narnia. The Christian allegory is quite strong in this book as it is with others. I found it a joy myself to return to Narnia after some time away. The new characters are quite fun. This story is better than the book previous (A Horse and His Boy) with good action and progresses the history of Narnia. I enjoyed this one enough to jump straight into the next one, The Voyage of the Dawn Treader. I was reading the Kindle version and was very pleased to see that the illustrations were included and of good quality. Recommended."
3,Prince Caspian,"Prince Caspian is the fourth book in the series of the Chronicles of Narnia by C.S. Lewis. This story is about Peter, Susan, Edmund and Lucy, who were Kings and Queens in Narnia. They were called back from our world to Narnia from a magical horn that Susan had left in Narnia before. They were called back to Narnia help to help Prince Caspian. Caspian's uncle, King Miraz, had killed Caspian's fater and took the throne of Narnia. Caspian found his life in danger and ran to Old Narnia, where dwarfs, fauns, and Talking Beasts are. Because of the need, Caspian used Susan's horn to call Peter, Susan, Edmund, and Lucy back to Narnia. They were able to expel the Telmarines with the help of Aslan the Lion. I liked this book a lot, but I thought that the Lion, the Witch and the Wardrobe was more interesting and a better read. I would recommend this book to anyone who likes to read shorter novels, and like books that are exciting, but dull at times."
4,Tony M: Prince Caspian,"The Dwarf Trumpkin tells the children (Peter, Susan, Edmund, and Lucy)the story of Prince Caspian and how he escaped the castle of Miraz for fear of his life. With the help of Aslan,(the lion)and the children, Caspian defeats Miraz and became the new king of Narnia."
4,Prince Caspian,"The book Prince Caspian by C.S. Lewis was about four children who once visited a magical kingdom and returned again. King Miraz (King of Narnia) for now, wanted to kill his nephew, Prince Caspian because he wanted his son to take the throne. Prince Caspian ran away an gathered people for a war. On the way he found the four children Peter, Susan, Edmand, and Lucy. They where walking along the way and they saw the REAL king of Narnia, Asland, the great lion and king of all the lands.Prince Caspian had a war with king Miariz and one of them won but, you will have to read the book and find out for yourself. I really enjoyed this book because it had alot action and adventure.It was very surprizing also. It was just a little confusing in a few parts of the book but it was fun to read. I felt like this was a good book because it taught you a good lesson and had a good morial."
4,Prince Caspian,It is a great book. It has very captivating writing. As well as excellent characters and settings. I give it four stars for all the things that make it such a great book.
4,"weakest of a delightful and enchanting series, but worth the read","The Pevensie children are called back to Narnia in order to save it from the tyrannical rule of Prince Caspian's uncle, who has destroyed almost all of the magic and wilderness from Narnia. Aslan also joins the children. Peter, Susan, Lucy, and Edmund all return to their roles of Kings and Queens of Narnia. Not as clever and imaginative and exciting as the first book in the series, but still very magical and delightful. The enchanting and complex characters of Reepicheep (the brave mouse) and Trumpkin (the conflicted dwarf) definately make the journey worth it."
3,Not as good as the rest of the series,"Just to be clear, the Narnia Series is one of the best children's book series ever written. However, I found Prince Caspian to be much less compelling of a story than Lion, the Witch, and the Wardrobe. The book was good and I give it 3.5 stars, but it is not great. The Christian allegory is still there, but it is much less obvious. Nevertheless, this is still a good book and children will really enjoy it."
3,Not my favorite,"This is not my favorite of the Chronicles of Narnia. Not by a long shot. I remember I didn't enjoy it that much as a child, and I was somewhat surprised to find that it was not much better when I re-read it last month. To me, the action seems quite slow-moving. The writing seems much more wooden and dated than in Lion. The early stuff when Caspian is at the castle, learning about old Narnia, is not bad. But the main journeying part is dull. Also, Lewis seems more preachy in this book than in others. I re-read Lion before seeing the movie and thought it was fabulous. And I am looking forward to re-reading my absolute favorite from when I was a kid, the Voyage of the Dawn Treader."
3,Not my favorite Narnia book,"As I go through and reread these novels, I am remembering how I felt when I originally read them. Even when I initially picked up the books to reread I remembered that Prince Caspian was not my favorite of the Narnia books but I hoped to see something in it that I hadn't before. I did but that only added to my ambivalence rather than building up my appreciation. The subtle sexism is less subtle in this novel than in The Lion, the Witch, and the Wardrobe. Not offensively so but undeniably there. Of course, given when it was written it is not unreasonable to expect there to be some sexism. Just disappointing, I suppose."
2,Title refers to what watching it does to you.,"Photogenic cast meandering through a time-worn plot. It looks like something thrown together in between auditions for real films. I wish I could be as enthusiastic as the previous reviewer but the best I can say for this is that if you happen to come across it on cable while you're sick in bed, then watch it. However, DO NOT go out of your way for it -- there are thousands of films more worthwhile than this one."
5,A Great Surprise,"In a time of sucky films, I give Stealing Time and its filmmakers kudos for keeping me engaged and making me care about these four young characters who, despite their Hollywood good-looks, did a fantastic job on screen with seemingly poinant direction. The photography was that of a big studio movie. And great ending!! Why didn't we hear about this film?!!! Put it in your queue."
2,Weak plastic handle,I was pleased to have a 'good quality' saw for backpacking. Unfortunately the latching mechanism broke on its first use in the woods. Black plastic handle split-appears to be glued together! The saw would not not stay open. Did not get a chance to appreciate other features such as cutting ability. Waiting to hear back from Gerber.
4,Always in my Backpack,The Gerber 46036 Saw with 2 blades is a constant part of my backpacking gear. It cuts very well and I have not experienced any problems as of yet. It appears to be durable and has a great grip for holding when cutting. It is relatively compact and comes with a decent sheath. It does not take long to change out blades and it serves a good utility. I recommend this saw.
4,excellent saw,"Excellent saw. Cut very well all type of wood, only problem is the handle.I broked mine while cutting a branch, no way to fix it,no screws in it,except the one for the blade. I wish they can make the same saw with a well reinforced handle. It works so good cutting without any effort.I will return mine and get another one,hope I wont have the same problem with the handle."
3,Not quite what I was hoping for,"Bought this a couple weeks ago, I've owned many other products from Gerber and loved them all so I thought this would be another winner. Sadly it just feels cheap. The blade doesn't lock securely when open and the release lever to close it is problematic. The whole thing gives you that cheap chineese knockoff feeling. I kept the product and I'm sure it would be able to saw limbs and branches if needed. But I definitely wouldn't call it a ""quality"" piece of gear."
1,*%$#* SAW,"I thought that this would be a handy little back up saw. Man, was I wrong. This is not a saw that you would want to have to cut fire wood, or saplings for a shelter. You can cut a 2"" willow with a knife faster than you can with this saw. I can not for the life of me see why anyone would want one. If I could give this one a ZERO star rating, I would. Yes, it is that bad... Total waste of money!"
3,Okay light duty saw for boning out big game,"I have owned this saw for the past 15 years. Got it as a gift when they first came out. I have cleaned over 100 animals using this saw. My original finally gave up the ghost this fall and I ordered this replacement.UPDATE:Well the saw worked very well on 2 buck deer, but broke while boning out a bull elk. Guess I could rate this as and excellent saw for deer but stay away from heavy boned animals."
3,Gerber Saw,"I purchased one of these as a gift after having one for years. My Gerber saw is made in the United States; however I immediately noticed this saw was made in CHINA. My U.S. version has been a very dependable and quality product. It is light and has remained sharp over many years of use, both as a bone and a wood saw. I keep the blades clean after use and they have held up very nicely. Very disappointed this Gerber product is no longer manufactured in the United States though. ""Made in the USA"" is very important to me; especially when purchasing outdoor/hunting equipment. Would have been willing to pay more for a USA made product."
1,junk,"I bought this saw a year ago to use for cutting bone while gutting big game. It worked good on the first elk I used it on. I took it hiking with me this summer, not looking at it first, when I needed it to trim branches off for firewood, I saw it was cracked down the length of it. I contacted Gerber, and they did nothing about it. I will never buy Gerber again."
1,JUNK,"First off, I want to clarify I did NOT buy this saw from Amazon. I did however get it as a birthday gift and let me tell you, this thing is a huge piece of junk. Flimsy blade, doesn't cut well, gets stuck in wood, bends extremely easy. The 5 dollar Ozark Trail Sierra Saw I bought from Walmart 5 years ago is 10x better than this one. What happened to Gerber? They used to make good quality products, now they just make cheap JUNK. Find a better saw, this one is a waste of money and went straight in the trash after a few minutes of use."
1,"falls apart, poor desgn","There is only a small , short metal tang with 1 hole that the plastic is melted over holding the blade mount assembly to the handle, no screws or rivets. Terrible design. At least should have the tang go fully the length of the handle. Used only several times before it came apart."
3,Hamilton Beach Cordless Cookie Press,"Has a good variety of dies, including the bar for making ""ribbon"" cookies - don't see that too much any more. The frosting and pastry filling nozzles are a nice touch. The motor is underpowered, though, (AT LEAST six seconds per cookie, and that doesn't giv you a generous size) and it goes through batteries like crazy. I would have preferred a wider handle that held larger batteries."
3,So who are the artifact people? And the doppelgangers?,"The female lead is running from the strange mechanical soundthat seems to be finding and killing her close friends and even her lover.A chase and doppelganger movie that seems to be about alien implants?The acting isn't all bad, but the plot is really pretty strange.No real answers here..."
4,Pleasantly surprised,"I watch a lot of bad movies, and I expected this to be no different. I was quite blown away. The music is totally standout, the acting is pretty great (though it lags at times), and the story's progression is tense. The story is pretty sparse, but I think that's by design, and I felt it worked well for the film. The camera and lighting is pretty, um... indie, but the whole film's budget is just $100,000. The audio work, on the other hand, is top notch. It may not be the shiniest, most polished film ever, but it's creative and deftly told. I suggest it highly."
4,Great Buy of Favorite Chopin Selections,Inexpensive CD with a great selection of Chopin. Why pay more
5,Wholesome Educational Video for Kids!,"This is an absolutely terrific video for young children. It says for ages 1+, but I've found that some children younger and lots of children older like it as well! The animals are great, as are the sounds for each one. The narrator has a pleasant voice and is quite soothing. Overall, this is a great educational video for kids and you don't have to be afraid to leave them alone with it!"
4,The ART of SPELLING is spellbinding!,"With Joan Reilly's illustration this lively, comprehensive & useful guide for spellers of all abilities takes a look at what our spelling reveals about our intelligence & personalities.Marilyn vos Savant reconstitutes our turbulent history in spelling this language we call English, offering us insights about the use & misuse of spell-checkers - remember, computers won't know the difference between wave & waive or their & they're & she sketches some surprising portraits of all kinds of us spellers.If spelling interests you in the least little bit, do give this book a go - you may very well find it a delight, I did! Do visit my site for my full review & editorials on the love of reading & writing!"
1,"Fascinating case, terrible movie","In this Showtime TV-movie, based upon a supposed real case of exorcism, Timothy Dalton plays a priest who becomes drawn into a situation with a young boy supposedly possessed.The performances are stone serious or absurdly childish, there is no suspense to be found in the writing, effects or production design, and it left me disappointed that no matter how hard I tried, I couldn't take the film seriously. It isn't delivered in a believable way, and becomes lost in mediocrity.I can't recommend the film, but I can somewhat recommend the book, which is at least a somewhat interesting, if not all too convincing read."
4,"Move over, Blatty","Ok, I just have to say that I hated the THE EXORCIST. It was pointless and nasty and not scary at all. POSSESSED is a far superior film, with believable and well-rounded characters, as well as a more interesting plot line. Two thumbs up!"
1,This is so fake,If you are an exorcist fan and expect this to come close to it >>>>>> SAVE YOUR MONEY !Incredibly fake and boring. I don't watch many movies and regret the time spent watching this one.
2,Boring unless you're religious,"This movie is basically a wanna-be Exorcist. And even Exorcist was boring in my opinion. Being an atheist, these movies don't appeal to me as scary or even interesting. Just like ghost movies or alien movies, possession movies require an interest in the subject to begin with. Unless you are religious and actually fear the devil possessing you, don't expect to be scared. This movie is just copy of a better film. Watch the Exorcist."
3,"Disjointed, but worth it for a few classics","This cd is all right,with a few standout tracks that are otherwise kind of hard to find. For that reason, it is worth picking up. Mainly, I listen to the tracks by Billy Squier, The Kinks, George Thorogood and Jethro Tull. Pat Benetar surprisingly disappoints here, as well as Christine McVie. Pick it up for a low price, and steal the really good cuts for your own compilation."
5,A machine quilter's dream,"Terrific first book by this lady. She's done a nice job of sharing the techniques she's used to win national competitions and excite people she's taught all over the country. But perhaps I don't have perspective... I'm married to her and lived through the creative process! If you're into machine quilting or myriads of other embellishment techniques, take a look and add your comments!"
3,book safe,one of the books was great opened in the middle of book; the other book was not as well hidden ie. fewer pages ;
4,2-Book Safes,"Unique hideaway safe that you can leave in plain view on a bookshelf. It look just like a book because it is a real book with the center hollowed out for hiding cash, jewelry, important papers, etc."
3,It's OK!,I don't regret getting it. The books look great on the shelf but you can only put few small things in it. It's actually OK ;)
2,"The Booksafe, which is not a safe!,","I ordered two book safes. One would assume if one ordered two of a product that each should look different. Next, the compartment instead of having two sections only had one, which was unlike the booksafe my grandchildren had desired. I was very dissatisfied with the products."
4,Nice diversion for safekeeping,"This book is excellent to stash small items in. There are about 30 pages left in the beginning of the book which help with the diversion. When closed on a shelf you cant tell any difference between this book and other ones. The only problem is it falls apart easily, so handle it with ease."
3,31.....And counting !,"Wow, I can't believe nobody's written a review for this yet. So I'll take point. If you like the Dream Dance series you'll like this volume. I gave it only 3 stars because, well, I've moved on to better stuff. I only still get Dream Dance volumes because I want to remain a loyal Dream Dance fan. Dream Dance introduced me to trance music back in '97 with vol.4. So I look to the Dream Dance series as being my roots. And I'm glad to say that I can't leave the Dream Dance series behind just yet. Thanks to songs like ""Eternal Sound"", ""X-Perience"", ""Indica"", and ""Sunlight Theory"" just to name a few. My favorite song on this entire volume though is ""Geschwindigkeitsrausch"", a song matched only by the length of its name! We'll just refer to it as ""Track 9"" by Ziggy X. Yeah, that song is really something. Dream Dance 31 is what I would say is your average Dream Dance album, but you might think differently depending on your experience with the series. I give it 3 stars."
4,I love it!,This is when Charlie Brown and Snoopy really got good. Great things happen in this book. Many firsts like Sally and the Great Pumpkin and many more cool stuff in this great book. Sally also falls in love with Linus and Linus falls in love with his teacher. I gave it four stars though because it is still early Peanuts and the later years were the best. I would give it five stars now but the computer won't let me. These are also the last years Patty and Violet as main characters. Although Violet will be main for the last time in 1961.
4,Great,"It's Peanuts, and it's great. A nice conclusion to an already-established decade of enjoyable comics.The introductory interview with Whoopi Goldberg is in itself a tasteful read.On to the next!"
5,"Charlie Brown and Snoopy Are For Everyone, Not Just Christians","Eric Paddon said in his review that Whoopi Goldberg's ""specialty is foul-mouthed hate diatribes toward anyone who isn't a raving leftist like her.""He also says Charles Schulz used lessons from the bible in his comic strip.Please don't believe Mr. Paddon, a professor at a Christian college. Ms. Goldberg didn't put any hate in her introduction to this book. She loves the Peanuts.You never had to believe in the New Testament or the Republican Party to enjoy the Peanuts. You don't now. I know a Muslim and a Buddhist who both enjoyed Mr. Schulz's comic strip for decades. Do Christian faculty members know that the cartoonist named Woodstock after that anti - family music festival ?Please plunge in this wonderful collection of Charlie Brown, Snoopy, Woodstock, Lucy, Linus and the rest of the gang. They are timeless. Maybe they can inspire today's children who show promise in cartoon art."
5,true heartbreak,"This is one of my favorite books but it broke my heart. this author has a special gift of making a character in a book dear to you but she took awayone of those charecters later she will return this charecter but the feeling for the charecter will never quite be the same.KEEP THIS IN MIND,avalon heartbreak"
5,"I read ""A Family"" in one evening!","I'm drawn to author's whose characters come to life and, in ""A Family for the Sheriff"", Elyssa Henry did a superb job! I also really enjoy tales about people who seem real rather than larger than life. If you've ever visited or lived in a small southern town, you'll agree that Ms Henry is right on target! Is this a new author? I'm trying to find other titles written by her and I haven't had any luck as yet..."
3,Pagan music meets Dr Demento!,"The Three Weird Sisters have their own brand of music, certainly. If you liked the Dr Demento show on the radio, you will like their albums. Some of the songs are nice, but others are just not my taste. I don't think I would get their next one, but others may enjoy it."
5,a must for all parents!,This has helped me 100% in my interaction with my pre-teen. It is helping me with the foundation of our relationship as he gets older!
5,Adapting Your Love,"Your relationship with your children changes as they grow, and this CD will help you figure out how to adapt your love to your growing child."
3,Review of the Five Love Languages of Teenagers,"I felt really stupid after I bought this book because it isn't for teens; it is for adults who have teenagers and how to love them. My mother read some and enjoyed, but since I am not a parent I didn't read all of it."
5,"Slow paced and analytical, but simply near perfect","Many Americans find Mann's analytical prose to be a bit on the tedious side, and indeed, there are some passages here that could have been shortened. But part of Mann's genius was his ability to capture every last detail, and this is one of his best. The unique take on Dr. Faustus blends Schopenhauer with tha ancient morality tale, and even focuses on human obsession with the great. Take a few weeks, and find yourself engrossed in Mann's astonishing prose"
5,Jane Austen,This is a wonderful book if you are a Jane Austen fan. I am a stitcher and have joined a Jane Austen stitchers group. This book was recommended and I am glad I purchsed it. We are stitching canvases from her time period and putting together a reticule (basket) of items that would have been used by Jane Austen in her time. Great fun and very interesting.
4,Hard combat interwooved with light moments,"Although it is true that an avid reader of World War literature will not learn many new things from this book, Grossjohan's memoirs remain extremely interesting because during his service he climbed slowly the ladder of hierarchy, going from platoon leader to battalion commander, with much success. Every chapter has a short introduction covering the ""big picture"" of the various campaigns where Grossjohan took part and then follow his experiences. I found most interesting the social structure of the German officer corps, the talent of the commanders, the stoic attitude of the low ranks and the magnificent discipline which Wehrmacht troops show, even in adversity. Grossjohan was awarded the Iron Cross Second and First Class, the Knight's Cross and the German Cross in Gold."
5,Renaissance name says it all,"I have associated the Renaissance series of CDs with quality progressive and it never fails to deliver. A well blended and mixed cd which you would expect from Dave Seaman, aswell as the trademark acappella's layered over some tracks. Not as haunting as his GU series CD's but it has the Renaissance trademark sound all over it.Some of you listeners in the U.S who have problems understanding the tracklisting, some are acappellas that are layered ontop of other tracks. Eg Placebo - Passive Aggressive is layered ontop of Digby & Oliver and are NOT two seperate cd tracks.BTW if anyone can tell me what is name and artist of the artwork on the front please do so."
1,Heavy on the left side,Recoreded improperly. Listen to it with headphones and you'll hear that the levels are turned completely off on the right side. The music itself is great though. frustrating
2,"No, this is not Dave Seaman","This album disappointed me greatly, those cd's has been in my player for about 2 months now, and still I dont get it. This mix simply did not touch my soul and feet. Save your money this cd sucks!"
4,A fan's a fan. 090201,"Keep them coming Dave. I love it all in any way, shape, or form. I like how you keep me on the edge of my own prefrences and then show me that there's more. My body yearns your beat. Dave won't ever keep you at the same pace in his music and in this album, and I really like how he's not afraid to experiment with his sound. He can take it as deep and dark as he can, and put as much 'acappella' sound he wants in it, and still make it sound ~so~ clean. There is a tough crowd out there, and here in Seattle, but in some way or another we're going to never miss a beat. I'm a fan yes. I'll go where he wants to go with his sound. I will also know that when there are 13 songs listed and 11 'tracks' show up, there is some serious dirtiness taking place and I thank you for taking the time out to list them, or at least the one's you feel like listing, for our own future events. His skill just can't be labeled. - kim koski"
1,Disc one is poorly mastered,"My review is not about the musical content of the CD, but rather the mastering quality of disc 1. Normally, mastering is one of the final processes before a CD is duplicated, and it ensures the CD is of uniform high quality. Ultra Records apparently forgot this step when they pressed disc 1, because the left channel is twice as loud as the right channel (+6dB) for the entire disc! This greatly reduces the enjoyment of the listening experience."
4,view from the cherry tree,"There was a boy named Rob. Who sat in a cherry tree and saw a murderer. There was an old lady who he didn't like because allitle before the murder, she hit him with a broom.His parents never beileved him, until they went outside and saw her hanging on the tree. To find out the who the murderer is must read this book. I suggest you read this book because it is very suspensful when the murderer is after Rob because he saw him push her out. If you find out the murderer before somebody, maybe if your friend is reading it with you don't tell him. It is kind of fun to know who the murderer is before your friend."
5,The View From the Cherry Tree: A Great Book,"The book The View From the Cherry Tree is a great mystery book that should be enjoyed by many people everywhere. It is about a boy and how he witnessed a murder. He tries to tell everyone after he gets over the shock of it, but everyone is too busy with his sisters wedding to listen. Now someone is trying to kill him and no one will listen to him about these life threatening events either. To find out what happens you have to read this phenominal book."
1,Stupid book,"I love animals, and I have no clue why they named that cat what they did (it's a really nasty name). Also, it was boring and stupid and I put it down all the time."
3,"Good mystery, but...","I enjoyed the plot of this book and think kids would too it was fast paced and humorous. However, the main characters cat's name is S.O.B. (yes it stands for what you think it does) and a few other foul words are used. I don't believe this is appropriate for kids to be reading on every other page let alone at all."
3,Good Plot,"Great plot following a young boy named Rob who sees his neighbor (he thinks) murdered from his hiding place in a tree. He isn't sure if it's actually murder or not, but pretty sure it's something he should talk about. The problem is, no one wants to listen with all the furor over his big sister's wedding. Very slow action in this book but probably all right for kids. Thumbs up."
3,Good Little Book,Me And My Sister Read This Book When We Were 11-12 And Really Liked It Alot. I Didn't Know Who The Killer Was Or How It Was Going To End. I Hardly Even Remember Anything About Other Then That. But I Know It Was Really Good.
4,My fav book,This book was a good mystery book. I think there should be more books on this character. It was a fantastic book. I give credit to the author.
1,Not worth the money,"Mine is going right back for a refund. It's not worth the money. The unit leaked profusely from the onset from the male hose connection that attaches to the inflow tube on the reel. I swapped out numerous washers, applied teflon tape, etc., to the connection to try and stop the leaking, but to no avail. I had a suncast reel prior to this one for a number of years that was much better built and more durable. This replacement was basically the same model, but I can only echo the sentiments of the others that the quality has certainly diminished. It is flimsy and made with cheap plastic parts with a very limited lifespan. Maybe be o.k. with use for lighter hoses, but not the heavy duty ones. I'll be looking for another brand."
1,Do not buy this product,"Unbelievably bad quality. Crappy plastic hose connection stripped while attaching hose to reel. The plastic is so soft if you are off just a bit, kiss the connection goodbye and Hosemobile. Never even got to use it once and decided it was not worth the gas and time taking back to Home Depot for a refund. Just save your money and spend more for another product that can withstand some normal use."
1,Unbelievable piece of junk!,"Bought it 3 days ago to replace a larger Suncast caddy that finally died after many years and repairs. I put 100' of 1/2"" hose on it carefully( it's supposed to hold 175')I'd like to see that happen! It sat for 3 days and when I went to use it, the spool wouldn't turn because it was broken. One side of the spool that holds the hose had sheared off from the reel. Upon looking closely, I found that it is held together with extremely thin plastic. Don't buy this product as it is pure garbage and I'm on my way to Sears now to return this abomination."
2,Poorly trimmed plastic parts.,"The Suncast model JTT175B hose reel cart I received on 7-30-09 came with a great deal of untrimmed plastic from around the edges of almost every part. I use a 100 foot Craftsman 5/8 inch rubber hose, and I just barely got it on the reel winding it smartly. The gap between the sides of reel and the sides of the cart is just wide enough to allow the hose to flop over the top of the reel and get stuck between them. Often when I pull the hose from the cart the hose gets stuck in the gap forcing me to walk back to free it, often times more than once. The short supply hose that came with the hose reel cart was defective, for it had a bad spraying leak where the male brass end is crimped to the hose. I contacted Suncast by e-mail regarding the defective hose, and I have not received a responce from them in the 3 days before writing this review."
3,Somewhat Sturdy,I've had mine for 5 years. The only real problem is the hose connection to the device is made of cheap plastic and either breaks or just loosens up so it will not keep a connection. I bought mine at ace for $30. I feel I got what I paid for.
1,Save your money - don't buy!,"Cheap, cheap, cheap. So poorly made of such flimsy material, I'm surprised it survived shipping. The least bit of pressure on the most crucial parts - the ones which should be engineered/manufactured to withstand such pressure - breaks them. And, of course, a company which makes such a terrible product doesn't sell replacement parts. More plastic to end up at the dump, and money wasted. I'd rather drag my hose around in 100 heat and 90% humidity than ever buy another! Phew, now I feel better - got it outta my system, now to drag the offending thing out of the yard!"
1,All of the Suncast hose reels leak from new. Cheap junk,"There is one thing you would expect from a new hose reels, and that is ""not to leak from new'.I have read dozens of reviews from various websites, and over half of the reviews state that these reels leak from brand new. Wish I had read these reviews first, because despite professional installation, IT LEAKS!!!!!!!DO NOT BUY ANY SUNCAST MODEL, THEY ALL LEAK AND ARE CHEAP JUNK. Plastic is so flimsy that it will fall apart the first time you put the slightest pressure on it. Wish I could give it less than one star."
5,Very enjoyable program,"It all starts at the upper most point on the Oregon Coast in Astoria. From there it goes down the coast visiting cities and towns. Historic and scenic spots including lighthouses are featured. The Oregon Coast is so beautiful. Some of the sunsets are remarkable.I thought the visits to the state parks and many interpretive centers added to the program. It even did a nice job covering the Oregon Coast Aquarium. The jelly fish were great. Watching them to music was like a ballet. It was well done. Narration, script and music were all executed well. The DVD menu was great for jumping around too."
4,Nice DVD,"This has nice images and interesting info of the Oregon Coast...a little short would be my only complaint...for a $25 DVD, it only has about 50 minutes of footage, but I guess that's just because there isn't a huge market for this kind of movie."
3,Review from the Synthesis,"On their past albums Love As Laughter has had a MC5, pre-punk inspired sound. With their new, aptly titled album, Laughter's Fifth, they depart from said sound to take on one that's even older. From the acid rock artwork on the cover, to the Keith Richards guitar tones, this CD screams late 60's rock and roll. There aren't any bells or whistles on this album, as the music is stripped down to bare essentially; drums, bass, guitar, vocals, and occasionally some keys. The only thing that really places Laughter's Fifth in this decade is Sam Jayne's distinctive vocal stylings. At a time when bands are reaching back to the 80's for inspiration, the heavy dose of late 60's rock put forth by Love As Laughter is as refreshing as it gets.-Jason CatanzariteSynthesis.net"
1,Great looking but not for long,I purchased this flatware 3 weeks ago because I loved the modern look to them and thought they would look great. Well I was a little dissappointed this morning after only three weeks that they are already spotting and rusting after only 3 weeks AND following the care instructions as best as I could. So in conclusion I am returning them this weekend for a refund because I am not serving any of my friends who come over for a casual get together with this flatware.
1,Junk,"I bought 2 sets of this stuff because the design was really great. We looked at Crate &amp; Barrel and Macy's before deciding the style and price were a better fit. Wrong!All of the knives rust and the rest of the pieces have water stains on them like you wouldn't believe. Tried to take it back to the store but of course, I kept it for 6 months, thinking only a few pieces would have a problem. It just got worse. Since I don't have the receipt, I am out the 140 cash."
1,Beautiful...for about 3 weeks,"I love the look and feel of this set. Great style, great cost, and they feel nice and heavy. Its a pity that they used such a low grade of steel because after only 3 weeks - I have several spots of rust. Back to the store they go.....what a bum deal - I really liked this set..."
1,Rust,"I bought this flatware in spite of the warnings about rust. Well, sure enough, rust started to form on the knives just after the first run through the dishwasher. The rust spots were small, but I returned the set anyways, as I am not willing to risk the severe rust problems reported by others.And just for the record, I did not use lemon detergent, and I only allowed the set to stay in the dishwasher a short while after the cycle completed. This set is at best a high maintenance proposition. Hand washing and drying is not for me!Its a shame, because the set really is beautiful."
1,Junk - rusted after only 3 weeks use,The silverware started having rust stains after only 3 weeks use. Returned for refund.
1,Great until it rusts,"The larger forks and spoons are a bit larger than I was expecting, but my wife and I love the look of this set. The pieces feel substantial, and the finish is wonderful. Unfortunately, they do rust like some of the other reviews mention. We bought two sets - one was handwashed, the other washed in the dishwasher. Some spoons began rusting after their first trip through the dishwasher, but both sets showed rust spots after a year. Our detergent isn't citrus either.In the end, I like the set, but an worried about the quality. I wish we had purchased something else."
2,Seller says it's 18/10 but we recieved 18/0 stainless,We loved the design and I have an older set of the same flatware design that is marked 18/10. This seller says the current listing of this new set is marked 18/10 stainless. The one received is marked 18/0 which is a less durable and cheaper material. SO that is either a misrepresentation of the product or a careless review of their own wares. We will be returning the flatware.
1,Rust after a couple fo weeks,They look very nice but after a couple of weeks I can see rust in some of the pieces. I bought this because their were suppose to be a high quality stainless steel... very dissapointed
5,Great Flatware,We received this flatware set as a wedding gift. I absolutely love mine. They are very durable and you can throw them in the dishwasher with no problem. And I love the look of them as well.
5,Twentieth Anniversary sparks best effort yet.,"Tuck and Patti's new release PARADISE FOUND celebrates their twenty years of making beautiful music together.Their Astyle of one guitar and one voice has been unique in the music industry since the grammy winning debut of TEARS OF JOY.The new album coalesces guitar master Tuck Andress' bass- rythym-lead style with Patti Cathcart's soaring vocals to produce a sound that is eminently listenable and a revelation of subject matter.For it is love,divine and spiritual,that keeps them together and makes them accessible to any audience and every listener.A fantastic album filled with orginial material and cover songs guaranteed to please any ear."
4,its a great cd!,"this cd is really good my only critisim is not enough originals! its not that they doen;t do a great job on the covers they do! its that i;m tired of seeing critics hammer cd's with less originals, such as the latest victoria warne cd live at the savoy, a great live cd but i've read critics short change it for not having enough originals! missing the point of how great the cd is! same here, it seems like when the greats get old they get away with it not here! still a excellent cd by 2 great musicians!"
2,The Secretary,"Dull and boring suspense tale that is strapped with cliché. Mel Harris stars as a businesswoman who begins a new job and is introduced to the office secretary (Sheila Kelley) who not only desires Harris's new job, she desires her life. I have seen other movies from the small series of suspense films produced by Pierre David and was expecting much more than this lame, slow-moving feature that delivers nothing more than some fine performances. Everything is too depressing to make the film exciting, and when we think something thrilling is about to happen, we get nothing more than a change to the next scene. This film is a waste of time. Some people may fancy it, but I am one person who likes a fast-paced thriller, and not thrillers like this."
4,Cigar Oasis,"Performs as described. Probably overkill for my 300 cigar humidor, but I need to be able to last several weeks between refills. So far I'm into week 5 since the initial fill."
5,A Breakthrough Album,"Although their more blues based work on their earlier records is still great, TCFTB moves The Hogs to a hard edged progressive guitar rock style, and advanced songwriting. It's kind of like Fleetwood Mac on Then Play On, only heavier and more hard rockin' . Every cut is a gem, my favorites are ""Strange Town"", ""Eccentric Man"", and the beautiful ""Garden"" that features a great progression that a group could jam on for eons. Essential."
1,What to use this line for?,"As a level fly line, this isn't a useful item. Level lines aren't particularly good for fly fishing as they don't allow a delicate presentation of the fly. The reality is that double taper and weight forward lines are available on-line for only a few dollars more or even less in some cases, on ebay for no name lines.If this were were a sinking line instead of a floating one, it'd be useful as a fly trolling line.The price isn't bad but the uses are unfortunately really limited.There's an old saying that that difference between a man and a woman is that a man will pay two dollars for a one dollar item that he needs and a woman will pay a dollar for a two dollar item that she doesn't. The problem is there aren't going to be a lot of women shopping for this.This item is a good price for an item that one really doesn't need at all. Crystal River really needs to offer this item as DT or a WF line."
5,Pretty Good,"Well im hardcore Rammstein all the away as well as Mega Herz, but i will say that knorkator is definintly different in a good way. Its awesome mosh music and i would buy tickets to see them in concert. to bad i just learned about them. Peash"
4,So many great ideas,"I remember using this book and theSocial Studies Discoveries on the Net: An Integrated Approach (Teacher Ideas Press)one many years ago for my boys when they were elementary age. I found these books at the library. There are quite a few ideas and we had some fun lesson plans based on these books. Several moms would ask me where I got the ideas for a lesson plan, for instance, insects. I mentioned this book. These books are large, oversized books. I'd have to look at them now, 2009, I would guess that many of the websites (most, probably) are no longer available but the book would still offer ideas on where to look and what to put together for different subjects.I am going to give this 4 stars because the links are out of date but the book was very useful many years ago when I needed ideas."
3,Interesting reading,"This book dedicates each chapter to a different medieval outlaw and describes their exploits. I wish it went into more detail the villans described are Fulk Fitzwarren, William Wallace, Gamelyn, Robin Hood, Eustace the Monk, Hereward of Wake, and describes the detail of peasant discontent relating to ballads. It could have been longer and more detailed and had more heroes such as Janosik . A decent read but short."
4,What it was really like on a medieval pilgrimage,"I have just finished reading this book and I must say that I really enjoyed it. I have read all the others in her series that have been published in English and this was a good addition. what struck me the most about this book is the author's ability to really let you see what going on a medieval pilgrimage was like. The pilgrims in the book are going to Santiago de Compostela, a very famous medieval pilgrimage site. The terrible hardships they endure are vividly recreated. You really felt how difficult it was to accomplish and it gives you new respect for those that completed the pilgrimage.I gave the book four stars because I think the mystery's solution was a bit weak. She's done better in her other books with that aspect but you can't fault Moore for her evocation of a time and place."
3,Disappointed,"The Kreg Miter Gauge Fence Add-on is all its said to be. Unfortunately however it is made to only fit a Kreg Miter Gauge. In order to fit most other miter gauges you must make another bracket to match up with the mounting bolts on the back of the Fence, which are typically too high for other miter gauge face plates. After buying special flathead bolts, modifying a piece of scrap metal and a little tinkering, it now does what I wanted it for."
4,Great insight!,I had never heard of the Count and was introduced to him in a text on the history of Christianity. This video is a wonderful effort to fill in the gaps. This man had a great influence on his own time and still continues to influence us today and many have never heard of him.
1,BAD ADVERTISING,"Knorr/Lipton Fiesta Sides, Mexican Rice, 5.4-Ounce Packages (Pack of 12)What they say you will get is not what you get. They say rice with Orzo what we tried to ordered. But what we got is 24 bags of rice with pasta. We don't like the rice and pasta. Know they say we can't return. BAD Advertising!!!!! Will not order from them anymore."
5,Can't wait for more in this series,"I read ""Into the Sunset"" in one day, even though I had to work that day. It was that good. I want more! Will Annie find out what happened to her brother? Will Dr. Holt find someone special? Hope this is only the first of many."
3,"A different story line, very creative and good writing.","Its an enjoyable story about a women(mistress) who kills her lover and his marshall brother who chases her down. The heroine of the piece comes from a less than ladylike background and bemoans the ""i'm nothing, nobody likes me"" line much longer than I cared for. In all fairness she is a goodhearted soul who proves to have backbone and eventually stands up for herself.Lucas, our hero, is full of the ""I am god"" syndrome.......he gets to know annie and eventually sees thru her goodness that she must be innocent. He than puts hit macho determined ""bring her to justice"" attitude into the same effort to save her. The cute little town of eminence, col with all its good hearted busybodies is a delight. The 2-3 loves scenes were pretty brief and superficial. I rate a book according to whether I would read it a second time. I had to rate this low because although I enjoyed it, once was enough."
5,Metaphorical Directing,"the whole movie, i found to be so slow-paced (that's what makes it so deep). it calms you with its thoughtful conversations and metaphorical images. it jolts you when you see an act of violence. stand-out stars: Tony Danza! this movie shows how underrated movie stars are. danza gives an oscar-worthy performance. nick gomez uses the camera to bring meaning and art to the miserable lives of two major drug dealers.IT'S A MUST SEE MOVIE FOR ANY DAVID LYNCH FAN!"
5,Franklin Sports LB Glove Conditioner,"This product is fantastic. I have never used foam glove conditioner before and it worked great. In my opinion, it's better than the oil based conditioners."
5,great,"I really like using Dr. Glove when oiling a glove. I relace gloves and use Dr. Glove, its my favorite! I have tried other glove conditioners, but I am really happy using this one. It doesn't leave any oiling feeling on your hands and it soaks in the glove really good."
5,special team&year,the 98 Yanks were truly special.they were unstoppable all the way through the World Series.all the Guys Came together&Joe Torre keeps all things going.this is one of the Greatest Teams ever&it's a cool overview to a Great Season.
5,Best team ever,"This team did everything in 1998,from Shane Spencer hitting 3 grand slams in septemberto Scott Brosius 3 run HR off of Trevor ""Hells Bells"" HoffmanWhat a team man!"
4,Wonderfull !,"This VHS is amazing. Pav. at 53 is at his summit. Levine is a good pianist but not especially brilliant. You want to hear and see real talent, try a recital, just a pianist and a singer. Many cute little songs from Respighi and Bellini. Go on Internet to see the content. 71 min."
5,Fantastic,"While I listened to Heart a great deal in their day, I have to say I was blown away by this concert. These ladies are in their 50s and wow what energy and fire they have! They are as tight as they have ever been and their song selection is wonderful. The covers of The Battle of Evermore, Misty Mountain Hop and Black Dog by Led Zeppelin were outstanding.Soundstage did a terrific job with the sound and production of this DVD. My daughter watched it with me and is now a Heart/Love Mongers fan.Grats to Ann and Nancy and the rest of the band. This is top notch!"
5,Fanfreakin'tastic!,"Ann and Nancy never sounded better. Still the rockinest two women around. Their early material is crisp, clear and updated. I loved hearing Ann sing Led Zep again. Wouldn't it be fun to see her duo with Robert Plant? If you love Heart, buy this DVD and turn it up loud."
2,"Too many slow songs, still love Heart though!",I thought there were too many slow songs. I recently saw them in concert before I bought this and they were AWSOME!
4,Heart DVD review,"This is a very good DVD. I had the LP Dreamboat Annie in the late 70s (melted when I spent some time in the tropics) so I couldn't believe my eyes when I found this DVD on Amazon.Even though a long time has passed, the performers are still so full of energy and the music is still brilliant. Even better, with modern recording, the middle tracks haven't lost their crispness (for those who remember the 'pleasures' of vinyl).Fully recommend it."
2,Much better Live HEART DVD's out there than this.,"Very disappointing. It's not what I had hoped for song-wise. It's the same old stuff Heart seems to put on EVERY DVD since their first back in the late 80s. The video and audio are about the same as all other Heart vids. Just very disappointed. I think it should be a personal choice as nothing is really wrong, but I was hoping for different material. Hoenstly what I would truly like is one or more DVDs from the OLD DAYS with the original line-up. I've been able to piece together one of their first televised performances from clips posted on YouTube. THAT was a great concert, and why is it that Heart can't do this themselves, or is Mushroom Records (now long time defuncy) still got some control over all that terrific material? If so, then why is Barracuda, Love Alive, Crazy On you, etc. on every DVD?"
3,this concert had no energy !,"I remember seeing Heart in concert and use to listen to them when I was in my early 20's.. I decided to bring back a few memories by buying this blu ray, I was very disappointed in the audio of this blu ray. Not sure if it was her mic or the audio person or her ..The crowd had no energy .Btw , this concert isn't set in a real concert environment , its set in small room with a about 60 people .So if you are looking for a concert that has that real concert feeling and the energy from the crowd, you might want to pass this one up. ..."
5,Blistering Acid Laced Rawk Madness!!!,"Blue Cheer is smokin'!! No wonder Danzig and Mudhoney covered their tunes. The production is terrible, the guitar is red-lined the whole way through and the drums sound like trash cans. This album RAWKS! Play it as loud as you can on the crappiest stereo you can find. It's the only way to salvation!"
4,"Wow, what a head trip","Blue Cheer were apparently one of the defining bands of the 60s ""acid rock"" movement, but these days they don't seem to get the respect afforded to others like Cream, Jimi Hendrix, and the Doors. This album pretty much explains why. Opening with a chugging, metallic cover of 'Summertime Blues', Vincebus Eruptum sets out to be a power trio tour-de-force, but it lacks some of the finesse of those other bands. The guitar is overdriven and fuzzed-out, the bass and drums pound frantically, and it's all captured in great lo-fi production. Three of the six songs are covers. The band's own songwriting is minimal - the songs they wrote (like 'Doctor Please') tend to dissolve into maniacal acid jams, which depending on your tastes could be exhilirating or tiresome. Most of all, Vincebus Eruptum just sounds like three lads having fun at high volumes. I can't quite put it up with the best work of that era, but nevertheless, it is an enjoyable work."
2,really surprised by the praise of all fans,"This review will not endear me to the fans of Blue Cheer, I know - but I would like to enter a different perspective on this record. I've had it (in lp format) for a long time, but never really liked it much. The recording itself is not well produced (it sounds rather muddy) and I don't think the playing itself is that great to start with. A famous song like ""Summertime blues"" is, while competently performed, not in any way revolutionary or remarkable, and Blue Cheer's own songs aren't really memorable either: ""Doctor please"" for example is a kind of blues workout that does not stick in the mind as it should.This record may be of historic importance in the sense that it pointed the way for other bands to follow, but I could not help being disappointed.While all Blue Cheer fans will now go for the ""no help"" button, I hope the other readers will check this record out before buying it."
4,Hear the granddaddy of metal bands in their debut,"Blue Cheer erupted on the radio in 1968 with ""Summertime Blues"" and I was immediately drawn to the over-the-top guitar riffs and psychedelic mangling of the old Eddie Cochran standard. It perfectly matched my extracurricular activities as ""sound candy"" par excellence. I bought (or possibly stole) the album and was immediately blown away, literally and figuratively, with a first-of-its-kind mushroom of a sonic nuclear explosion.That same year my girlfiriend and I panhandled our way into a Blue Cheer concert at the Sacramento State University's men's gym. I have been to many, many concerts over the years but I have NEVER heard anything as loud as Blue Cheer was that night; in a venue as small as the men's gym the Wall O' Marshalls were gigantourous. They were every bit as great as the album only better and louder.This group was the granddaddy of metal bands and this album was a breakthrough."
3,"For the Love of God, Remaster this Album!","I love this album. It has, for 30 years, been one of my favorite mental purgatives. It purifies the mind by flushing it out with its blistering cacauphony. Unfortunately, This release sounds about as bad as a cheap casette. Hasn't Phillips made enough money off of these guys since 1968 to maybe, just maybe, consider remastering this proto-grunge metal classic from the orginal tapes? If you can find it, the import version on Akarma is significantly better, though not as good as a thorough re-working from the orginal masters could be. Same goes for Outside/Inside and New & Improved."
5,Great Heavy Metal Rock From A Highly Underated Group!,"Blue Cheer released this debut in 1968 when groups and artists like Cream, Jimi Hendrix Experience, Iron Butterfly, Steppenwolf and The Doors were putting out psychedelic rock. Blue Cheer were three guys who played loud psychedelic rock and I can still see those stacks of Marshall amps piled a mile high. These guys had one major hit ""Summertime Blues"" which has been covered by other artists. Their version stands alone by itself as my favorite. The other songs on this album such as ""Out Of Focus"" and ""Parchment Farm"" are pure psychedelic kick a.. rock. This groups follow up album ""Outsideinside"" was also much of the same. Too bad these guys didn't get the credit they deserved and were lost in the shuffle of all the psychedelic groups popping up in the late 60's. If you're into 60's psychedelic rock don't pass this gem up. Highly recommended!"
5,The Origin of Stoner Rock,JUST LISTEN to Vincebus Eruptum!! These guys did it back in 1968 what bands like KYUSS did in the early 90s.....the source and inspiration of stoner rock if you will.
2,I guess I CANT go back.,"I bought this cd thinking I remembered just how hot the band was, and how they were the progenitors of something that has since evolved into a wide genre of hard, loud, faster-than; I guess that all the drugs I did really colored my perspective. I was hard-pressed to find ANYTHING that really spoke to me on this disc. For those fans who can't imagine what I'm babbling about, sorry, no offense. Just keep doing what yer doing. I know that I really dug INSIDE/OUTSIDE, so I guess my next move is to dig out the stereo and lp and see if that sentiment still holds true."
5,Industrial Strength paint remover !,Saw these guys and the Wall O' Marshalls in the Racine Armory-GAWD! I swear the paint peeled off th walland Peterson's hands were reduced to bloody hamburger as he demolished drumsticks. Leigh Stephenswalked among the guitar gods. In a pinch I'd place Vincebus next to Deep Purple In Rock as the birthplaceof Metal. The album cover has a place of reverence on my wall.
4,Cheers,You guys are funny. None of you were around when Blue Cheer were playing.How do you know so much?
5,No match!,"Blue Cheer is unfortunately one of the most underestimated bands ever. People say SAbbath invented heavy. Forget it, Blue Cheer, where the first that ever did heavy metal. So much noise, so much talent. Their debut album Vincebus Eruptum, is so immense, with so many genius songs. My personal favorite is ""Out Of Focus"".Leigh Stephens guitar sound is so high, and cool. Ive never heard anything like it.And by the way, not only oldies listen to this music. im 16 right now, listened to them since i was 14"
5,A Delightful Story for Children,"This is a beautiful book. Both the artwork and the story will keep the interest of children for many readings. All of Tomie DePaola's books are treasures to keep for generations of children to enjoy, and this one is no exception.The story about Pascual, who is the patron saint of cooks and kitchens, will teach children about putting our trust in God who is always there for us.I also recommend ""The Clown of God"" by DePaola, another great story for children."
5,split-a brilliant album,originally i heard this masterpiece in the early 70s-i ve played it ever since.The guitar and vocals are out of this world.Tony still performs the tracks brilliantly to this day.He played a brilliant set in a small Yorkshire town in early June 2001-just buy it you wont be dissapointed
3,off the beaten Track,"The Groundhogs are not for everybody from the get go. They are unusual. Not their worse album, but I certainly think it is weak as compared to ""The Mighty Grounhogs"" or songs like 3744 James Road, or I love Miss Ogney."
3,needed a bigger card,"It was a short card,just 5 matches.Brian Pillman vs Jushin Liger,Dustin Rhodes and Barry Windham vs Steve Austin and Larry Zybsko,The Stieners vs Arn Anderson and Bobby Eaton,Ricky Steamboat vs Rick Rude,and Sting vs Lex Luger.It was great but it needed more matches."
4,get it love it,nice and smooth mellow beats get it it is worth it a masterpice whit not many followers 2 come close
5,Magical collection!,"Christy Shaffer has created an excellent array of magical creatures - easy to color, but intricate enough to be interesting. I originally bought this book for my 4 year old daughter, but after looking through it, quickly rescinded it. Since you can use these images - royalty free - for graphics and crafts applications, I decided to make a collection of ceramic plates with my favorite images. Enjoy!"
3,Works fine,Lighter works fine though is not as solidly made as some other Colibris I have had. Butterfly opening mechanism feels a little cheap and seems like it could break easily.
4,it is good,"really i liked it ,it makes a great difference ,you can see clearly with bigger magnification , you can see the disc clearly and the vessel as well even before you reach the aye it is really great invention and revolution in ophthalmoscopy worldbut the worst thing is the delivery it took a very long time ,longer than the estimated time and they never called or even explained the reason until i sent many inquiry messages which made harder on me to get it oversees anyways overall it is a nice product"
3,Good Stuff,"I have watched 3 of the films so far. As noir films, they are very good.RAILROADED and BEHIND LOCKED DOORS are average quality picture/sound.THE LONG NIGHT has very good picture quality, but there seems to be a fault with the sound in a few places where it shifts from 2 speakers to one (and in the process the volume drops right down)Still have the remaining films to watch this week."
3,'Ward' Not Dealing With The 'Beaver' This Time,"For people who grew up watching ""Leave It To Beaver"" on TV, this film offers Hugh Beaumont as a main character. Beaumont is famous for playing Beaver's dad ""Ward."" In this movie, he's a tough cop, and fun to watch. I also enjoyed ogling a pretty brunette, ""Rosie,"" played by Sheila Ryan.The climax to this story was good, and it was surprisingly realistic. There was some decent film-noir photography in spots, too. That's no surprise considering Anthony Mann was the director.The film is okay, but with the high price (VHS, at the time, and now DVD) it tends to give you really high expectations. I found I liked this more on the second viewing when I knew what to expect and my expectations were a bit lower.In the beginning, the story dwells too long on the innocent man-being arrested theme but after that part is over, it picks up. John Ireland is good as the villain ""Duke."""
3,so so..,"I love film noirs but beware: this set has only 2 worth seeing. ""Sudden Fear"" with Joan Crawford and ""The Long Night"" with Barbara Bel Geddes. The others are grade B films at their worst. Sadly though, if you're a Joan Crawford fan like me, this is the only way as of yet, to purchase ""Sudden Fear""."
3,Remastered DVDs?,"Has anyone heard if this collection from Kino Video,have all been Remastered with better picture & sound? It's a great collection,but not if Kino has done nothing to them...Aloha Craig"
3,Second Fiddle to a Steel Guitar,"The product was sent on time; the dvd plays well. Other reviewers mentioned that the focus of this movie is the music from these country music artists. The comedy, interspersed throughout, was not funny, but doesn't take away too much from the enjoyment of watching/listening to these musicians."
3,Poems for the Modern World,"The poems of Stephen Dunn seem to be written for the ""Baby Boomer"" generation. Although he seems sad and disconcerted, he voices the feelings that we are often loathe to express for fear of censure regarding current events."
3,DIFFICULT FOR A SINGLE MOM,"I dont know- I had to pay extra to get it hooked up. I have 2 ask my dad and still awaiting for him to come over and bring the mattress down because the baby is standing by holding on and I am scared she will tumble over so she has NOT been sleeping in her crib but with me. Wait in the beginning I was scared of Sids, then I started to put her in and now this.. the rails dont go up nor down ONLY mattress.... that SUX!!!Its Still a firm crib. I havent had any problems with it but I hate that the rails do not come down! Its sturdy and it looks nice, the finishing is nice. I am not into colors so if I want to colorize it, I can do so and any color will go pretty will it"
3,Pleased with the crib but unhappy with the company,I love the look of this crib and mine was in perfect condition when it came out of the box. The one issue I did have was that the bolt package that came with the crib for assembly wasn't complete. They gave us too many of one bolt and not enough of the other. I immediately called the company and to my surprise they were more than willing to send out another complete bolt assembly. They told me the bolts would arrive in about two weeks. I waited two weeks and received no bolts. I then called again and was told the bolts were on back order and it would be two more weeks before they were even sent out. Needless to say it took a month and a half to reveive the bolts needed to finish putting the crib together. All I can say is thank goodness my baby wasn't here yet!
2,"Beautiful to look at, but not very practical!!!!!","Like so many other reviews, I purchased this crib because of the looks and sturdiness of it! Once I got it home and set up, I realized how impractical it was - the bumper wouldn't fit due to the solid ""headboard"", as well as the thickness of the legs (the crib mobile that I purchased wouldn't fit for the same reasons); it's pretty much IMPOSSIBLE to change the sheet without having to take the mattress completely out every time, and when the mattress is at the lowest setting and you're 5'3"" like I am, it's extremely difficult to put your sleeping 23 month old in the crib! Now that my son is ready for the toddler bed stage, I notice that there really isn't any kind of safety rail to ensure that he doesn't fall out. Overall, I am very dissapointed with this crib and I wish I knew then what I know now!!!"
3,"Sturdy Crib, but has many flaws!!","I fell in love with the look and sturdiness of this crib, but I agree with all the complaints regarding this crib. I had the same bumper problems, and issues with the non-adjustable front rail. When your 5'2 it's very hard to put my 1 1/2 yr old daughter in the crib at the lowest setting without waking her. It is a beautiful crib, but I wouldn't buy it again."
4,Solid Crib,I think this is a great crib which is very sturdy. The only thing I don't like about it is that your child can put teeth marks on it.
2,Several problems with this crib,"Although it was very easy to assemble and reasonably priced, I am not very happy that we bought this crib. First, we wanted to put bumpers around the crib, so we had to line the ""headboard"" side with velcro. That worked out fairly well, except that when our baby was too old for bumpers, we ended up peeling off the paint along with the velcro. Secondly, most mobiles don't fit very well on this crib. Our mobile just didn't look very sturdy on it, so we took it down, even though I think our baby would have loved it. It's attractive, but the bumper and mobile problems were annoying."
2,a serious book for serious people...,"This is well meaning, but unfortunately a bit dull. Although I don't really want to patronise Ms. Jeffries, I felt her effort was overly earnest and not particularly illuminating. Having said that, perhaps a useful guide for students who are interested in the very practical aspects of the English language"
5,TOUCHING Messeges,"Daddy¡s Hug¡s is an inspirational book about male role in the family circle. It is an important message to all men. We¡re the HEAD and not the TAILS, meaning we should always be there for our kids and family. Monetary reasons make this mandatory. Our presence is the key in raising healthy children, both physical and mentally. Our kids have reflections on other people¡s lives. When we¡re absent in their lives the same pattern continues."
5,A Looking Glass,"I have read both of Charlotte's books. In fact, after reading A Journey to Hell & Back, I was compelled to read her new book. I thoroughly enjoyed both books. However, reading Daddy's Hugs was like looking in a mirror. I'm waiting on the next one."
4,Nice little thriller.,"She may be supposed to look nerdy and unatractive, but I think Tracy Nelson's a real babe in this one !. As with most Pierre David productions, the story's pretty thin. -In fact, they seem to be using the same basic psycho-woman idea often. (There's a newer movie out called ""The Landlady"" with Talia Shire; and it's really the same foolishness over again - only with a much higher body count.) In this one Nelson is the wacko, obsessed with pretty radio-host Shanna Reed; and who can blame her ?. Nelson makes a good loony but Reed's reaction to all the murder and mayhem she finds herself in, is a little too light. It may be the same old formula, but it's very entertaining. Oh, and, lower that nutty price soon, please."
3,OK THIRLLER COULDVE BEEN A LITTLE BETTER,A young woman goes over the edge and becomes obseesed with a radio D.J. and will do anything and everything to keep her attention. Not bad movie. Theending couldve been a bit better but this is a lot better then I still know or i knpow what you did last summer and all that teeny bopper crap they're churning out. The actress playing the crazy woman is perfect for the part. it probably minus some violence and language couldve been a tv movie but hey it is ok and watchable!
5,"Older label, was originally only $5 new, but excellent Mozart recording.","This was the first CD I ever bought in Boston, MA and was also the first inspirational Mozart recording to learn this Concerto. There are some small technical errors, but the music performance easily outshines them. Even the recording quality is quite good, the piano and orchestra sound is strong, a good unenhanced recording. Some 'good' label recordings I cant even listen to, they're so boring, but this whole CD is good. Its alive, beautiful & authorative."
1,not for micro photo,I plugged it into my car and my 6 gb zen micro photo and it not only didn't charge the player it killed the battery which still had a 1/2 charge on it.It is a generic charger and does not work for this player.
4,"Worked, but had a hardware problem later.","I got this charger in August 2007. I plugged my player into it every time I used it in the car. Between late January 2008 and early August 2008 it wasn't being used because it was not in my possession (or anybody else's). Then in late February 2009 I noticed that it wouldn't plug in anymore. When I examined the mini-USB end, I saw that a little piece inside was sunken in and caused the metal inlet to be pushed inside the rubber body when plugging it into the player. I tried to use tweezers to pull up the metal form inside, but it was no use. I threw out the charger and am buying another one to see if it happens again. I think this time though, I will only plug in my player for trips longer than 15 minutes. It took about a year altogether for this problem to occur, with daily plugging and unplugging."
4,Good value and wife likes it!,"I am a bit of a heathen and couldsleep on a rock, but my wife issensitive to her pillows.It passed her test, and now I can sleepvery well."
4,"Fun to read, just be aware","Fun to read, just be aware that the first few pages don't give a biblical account of creation, but rather describe an evolution of the world. Although God is mentioned as having existed before the world was in existence, God is not mentioned in the formation of the earth or creation of plants, animals, people. Instead, the author gives an account which sounds a lot like evolution even though the author doesn't use this terminology. He goes on to talk about primative people that didn't speak, but rather grunted to communicate. Overall, it is a very fun way to read about historical events."
4,Read this after finding it at Strand Bookstore in 1987,And was amazed by the wonderful storytelling and the drawings. Made history come alive in the way it should for children. Just remembered it. My copy was stolen in the 90's when my apartment was broken into. I've just ordered a copy for my 9 year old and very much look forward to reading it again with her.
4,Written in an engaging fashion,"A Child's History of the World is written in an engaging fashion. It is told like an interesting story rather than a mere factual account. My 8-year-old has requested it repeatedly, now, as a bedtime story. I am happy with this purchase."
2,Sermons from the 1800's,"This book contains edited essays of Emerson written in the 1800's. They seem to me like the sermons of a minister, which he was. They are often incomprehensible -- maybe 10% inspirational, using words as ministers did at that time. I had to push myself to finish it; however, the later essays were better (more understandable, showed common sense at times)."
1,Buddha Schmudda,"This is nothing but ""new age"" ""smooth jazz"" pap with some creepy vocals thrown in that sound like people having sex. Only the really needy shallow uninitiated desperate nonseeker would subject themselves to this insult."
5,Truly Amazing,"The 1996 World Series played out like a movie. This video shows the pure drama of all 6 games played. From Andy Pettit's 1-0 gem, to John Wetland's clincher in the Bronx. This is the best sports video I have seen. A true story book finish. Go Yanks!"
5,"Como Martin Gardner, como Yakov Perelman","Escribí este libro inspirado en los de Martin Gardner. Cada capítulo trata un tema relacionado con la física o la matemática (los viajes en el tiempo, la cuadratura del círculo, la física de Julio Verne o H.G. Wells). Durante el capítulo se plantean pequeños enigmas que son resueltos en el texto o al final del capítulo. No es habitual encontrar este tipo de obras en español. Espero que lo disfruten"
5,For Serious Linguists,"This is not a Rosetta Stone, self help guide to learning Polish. It delves deeply and precisely into the grammatical and syntactical nuances of this complex language. I would only recommend it to people who have mastered a second language already and understand the finer points of language construction."
3,OK,It was free so what should one expect? Exactly!! Expect nothing and you won't be disappointed like I was. Was not gripping my chair.
2,Meh,"I'm not big on production stuff on movies, since I think they spoil a movie, but if you are you might like this."
4,A good read,The story is keeping my intrest so far. I believe i have read this already because im getting a Dja Vue feeling.
5,"Jon, I am glad your back on lead vocal,it was about time!!!!","It,s been awhile since Jon has had all of the vocal duties and I personally think it has been long overdue. The album---I think it is the best one since ""Hall of the Mountain King"". I love Jons voice and the and the riffs are excellent. All in all, this album is worth getting because the songs will stay in your head after you stop playing it. That is a good sign to me. 5 stars!!!!! Thanks Jon!!!!!!"
4,Not The Bands Best. But Still Good,As a long time fan of Savatage I was excited to hear this album. Espcially since I had heard that Jon Oliva was doing all the vocal work and I've always been more into his voice than Zac Stevens (I do love his too).However that turns out to be where the true downside of this album is.You see it can easily be heard(I've checked into this too) that the song's were not wrote for Jon's voice. So it doesn't work as well as it could have if Zac had done it.The songs are solid and catchy. There's plenty of emotion.Plus this looks to be the last true savatage album.
3,I miss Zak...,"I started listening to Savatage when Edge of Thorns came out, but I thought they became unique with Dead Winter Dead. I thought P&M might continue the trend, but it's a step backward. The music is not quite as good as Wake of Megellan, much less Dead Winter Dead - it lacks the haunting beauty of those two albums. It reminds me more of older Savatage and lesser bands. At times it seems like Criss is struggling to sing parts that would be effortless for Zak. If he sang on this album, it would merit 4 stars."
2,aside from a little technical skill- a lame duck,"i may be biased towards Dead and Wake, but after picking up this CD, i couldn't compare it to any other album they have produced. It just didn't have anything I wanted to hear and the compositions seemed lifeless and uninspired.i swear i could hit the random button on my cd player and each time hear the album and still get the confusion i got with the first run through. I could not tell how the songs related to the story no matter what order. pathetic, guys.it is nice to go back to the heavier roots- i encourage it- just do a better job."
2,"Excellent night imagery, but very dull.","Wow. I thought Savatage could only get better with the wake of magellan. There are some good night songs (like Drive and Morphine Child) but most of it sounds like leftovers from Streets. Where's the loud night booming choruses? Zak was good, and I'm glad that Jon's back in the band, but this is no excuse from a great band. Please, no more concept albums. You already have 4!"
2,sighing,"The denile stage is over for me. I am rather a fan of Savatage, and I must say this is pretty dissapointing. There are nice spots but for the most part this sounds, to me, predictable and tired. None of the songs strike me as their best. ""Morphine Child"" stands shoulders about the rest, but even the layered harmonies in the middle seem stale. Better luck next time."
3,headed downhill,"even after losing chris oliva, this band was able to thrive, thanks to excellent songwriting coupled with the frighteningly powerful voice of zak stevens.now, chris AND zak are gone, and what we're left with is ok, but lacks the musical punch of the hall/gutter ballet days, and lacks the vocal power of DWD, edge of thorns, etc.jon's voice made an interesting counterpoint to zak's on the last couple releases, but this is the first album where it's had to stand on its own (without chris's guitar or zak's pipes), and i don't think it's up to the task. he sounded ok once, but that was pre-zak. you can't feed a hungry man steak and merlot for a year and then expect him to go back to rice and water without complaint. all in all, a middling effort. the songwriting is still good enough to make it a slightly better than average release, when compared to its contemporaries, but the glory days are gone for this band."
1,"Bad, heavy pop music","This is total pop music. The guitar work blatently tries to imitate the style of Savatage co-founder Criss Oliva, but it comes off as just that: an imitation. Jon Oliva's voice is horribly raw and nerve-grating. It makes Varg Vikernes (Burzum) sound like the Tallis Scholars in comparison. Too bad that Zak Stevens left before making this album. If you like metal that is driven by melodic guitar playing, with lots of counterpoint, rather than overly catchy pop vocal melodies singing maudlin stories, get Savatage's Edge of Thorns, Gutter Ballet, Hall or the Mountain King, or even Sirens and The Dungeons Are Calling, instead. If you already have those, try King Diamond or Dissection."
5,Awesome compilation,"This is the greatest compilation of this decade. Right up there with Sire's Just Say Yes in the 80s and Wipeout XL in the 90s. The genres aren't totally new, but songs are well done. Great driving beats..."
4,excellent service!,"i wish they had other shipping options available because it took a little long for my book to come, but it came in brand new, like the description said, very satisfied! and i will be ordering from them again."
4,Great fun,"If you have ever wondered what would happen if you combined of H.P. Lovecraft and Len Deighton, you have the answer here.Often witty and amusing and genuinely clever. It is somewhat rough and ready but it is very enjoyable.This really consists of two different stories and is somewhat episodic which reflects the stories origins as they were originally published in magazines.The background details are very interesting and the author has created a fully realisable background for his books.It did sometimes read as a fantasy of a frustrated IT helpdesk employee but generally always in an amusing way.Computational Demonology is a great idea and it was great to read a light hearted thriller with well done actions scenes, decent dialogue and very well worked out scientific (sounding) and occult elements."
5,Sheer fun,"I'm not going to add much to the already cogent praise on this site. This is a sheer cyberpunk romp, very cleverly written. Your appreciation will be enhanced if you have some background in espionage, World War II, computers and their history, and Lovecraft's Cthulu mythos. If you don't recognize the references to James Angleton, Alan Turing or Shub-Niggurath, you'll get less out of it -- but you'll still enjoy it."
3,"If you have to explain, it probably wasn't funny","The author adds a very lengthy explanation of what this book is about as an after word. He compares himself to other authors and other genres in what seems to be a justification for this book. It doesn't work for me. I found the book, which is really a blotted novella attached to a short story, disjointed and confusing. The basic idea is not especially new, although the author would have you believe it is, in that certain aspects of magic are really just extensions of quantum mechanics and multiverse theory. I think you can find this theme in SciFi from the 1950s and it is basically what Phillip Pullman does in 'His Dark Materials' trilogy; only Pullman does a good job of it. This is probably worth your money if you are really into very light Scifi, but if you are looking for something more serious I'd advise avoiding it."
2,A Bit on the Dumb Side,"There are some interesting concepts, but the story line is actually a bit formulaic. There are a good 50 pages about 2/3 of the way through, but there is an incredible amount of set-up in order to get there, most of which could actually be ignored. A lot of it is just plain silly."
2,A book that revels in its own geekitude,"but doesn't offer any real tension or drama. reading this is like reading a geek's blog, lots of silliness, lots of attention calling gambits and lots of geek snobbery, where the author throws stuff in just to try to impress you with his knowledge. What I wanted was a magic wielding spy, what I got was a magic wielding spy who doesn't do spy stuff, throwing out explanations that make no sense and talking about his daily life living with other nerds.I have a feeling that Charlie is one of those guys who goes to a party and wind up alone because everyone realizes he's one of those guys who will always try to one-up you on any idea you put forth."
1,Office Space + Lovecraft = FAIL,"It claims to be James Bond meets Lovecraft and is, kinda ... but the everyman office worker main lead is just so dull I couldn't finish. The mundane office politics overwhelm the occult and the incessant expository dialog is a slog. Just call it a gun, don't give us all the statistics. Most of the part I read was either mundane office stuff (which I get plenty of at work) or people talking at length ABOUT summoning technology with plenty of long words that are meaningless. There was very little action and what little there was was over way too quick (like 10 pages of talking, 1 page of getting attacked by tentacles, then another 10 pages of talking about said tentacles). There are also too many in-jokes. Lots of ""nudge, nudge, did ya get that name I just dropped?"" That's fun occasionally but every other paragraph it gets old fast. Normally I'm a trooper and will finish anything I start but this one I just can't."
1,smashed prose and half baked story,"I bought the book on the reviews of his other books. That was a mistake. The writing felt like a sixth graders rewriting of slapstick Doctor Who. It might have been OK as a very short story but the plot drags, the characters are cardboard cutouts. The story is trying to be an action packed cyber geek wannabe James Bond novella and fails, terribly.Oh, and not to mention the flobby chaser story at the end that is connected to nothing and is about as meaningful."
2,Nothing like 'A Colder War',"I was anxiously awaiting the release of this book after reading the novelette 'A Colder War' and hearing that this book is an expansion on that story.I was very disappointed as everything was different. The hero was changed from a family man, to a young punk kid, and moved from the US to the UK. The technology was changed from being old and alien to witchcraft. And an unnecessary love interest is introduced.The entire concept of the great filter that wipes out civilizations once they reach a certain technology level is abounded. And the whole concept of humanity on the brink of extinction is missing.'A colder war' was wonderful, and I was really looking forward to seeing how the story ended. It's a pity that the author decided not to try to dig his hero out of the hole he was in at the end of 'A Colder War'"
1,So-So... just a pastime,"No reasons to hate it... but none to love it either. Formulaic, satisfied with its Britishness, copying a bit from everybody... OK to spend an hour with, but never ever to cnosider worth rereading, such as many many other books I can think of (such as Tim Powers's and Gene Wolfe's just to mention two of my favorite authors)."
4,A lot more fun than Accelerando,"Stross is in his usual form with hundred mile an hour concepts pouring into the story line. At least there is a more solid story line here, though there is still a slight quantum jitter that occurs between chapters.I skimmed through the somewhat philosophical postscript that Stross wrote as a kind of ""afterward"". I think it kind of went past me, or over my head or something. Anyway I didn't find it of much interest."
3,Not Charles Stross' best work...,"I really liked Charles Stross' ""Singularity Sky"", so I purchased""The Atrocity Archives"". ""The Atrocity Archives"" is a muchweaker book. Stross takes a few premises (magic exists asas suppressed science, all of the major countries have groupsin charge of magic suppression, great scientists and mathematicianshave stumbled on the keys to this suppressed knowledge) and buildsa book without much in the way of characters or even plot. Thebook is really just a sequence of episodes. The plot centersaround a guy who is basicly a system administrator who getsdrafted into the larger work of technology suppression andThe Fight Against Evil. The book reads like a collectionof stories, which perhaps it was.Stross mentions that while he was writing The AtrocityArchives, Tim Powers book ""Declare"" was published. ""Declare""has a similar plot, but a much stronger story line and strongercharacters."
3,I expected more,"Reading the rave reviews here, I HAD to try this one. It wasn't up to the acclaim for me.Stross has created a detailed world, and delivers an incredible texture to his story, but if you don't have a computer science degree, it might be tough figuring out what is magic, what is technical, and what is just gibberish. There's so much here that seems inside humor, and I, for one, was on the outside.The book has amazing potential, but by avoiding mainstream readers, it won't be as successful as the author deserves.Make no mistake, this book has some really great ideas, and combines Lovecraftian horror with action, and dunks it in the movie ""Office Space."" Portions of it just fly along, and the original ideas are fantastic.The problem was that when explanations were made, I just don't speak programmer language, so I didn't get it, and the book bogged down.I won't say this is not a good book, but if it were slightly less reliant on the technical language, it would be elevated to great."
4,CthuluPunk!,What a hoot... enough inside geek jokes to choke a Gibbering Horror...I finished it in record time... and re-read it a day later to catch everything I missed the first time!
4,Super Reader,"A fun combination of Lovecraft monsters, evil ratzis, spies, and Yes Minister, with a touch of Snow Crash.Robert Howard works for 'The Laundry' - the slang name for the spook agency that deals with thaumaturgical, paranormal and invasion by cold, alien intelligences from other universe.Interesting lengthy essay at the end where Stross talks about the spy novel as horror novel, due to the horrible looming real life threat of nuclear armageddon that was the thread running through a large number of them in recent times.Entertaining solution for useless paperclip counting backstabbing office politicking bureaucrats, too!"
4,Better then Lumley,"I constantly find myself searching for new books, finally, I found a decent one with the Atrocity Archives. Stross has a writing style that is easy to handle, and a subtle black wit throughout the book. A recommended read for anyone."
5,You gotta buy this book -- The Brothers Bulger rocks!,"Sorry for not including my name, but I don't want ""Squeaks"" or one of those other South Boston plug-uglies ""visiting"" me, if you catch my drift.I am a lifelong resident of Charlestown (think Southie with class), and this book squares with everything I know about Southie and the Bulgers. Its accuracy is beyong debate.Having said that, the raw ambition of Billy and Whitey as recounted by Howie is staggering. The brothers' steely resolve to remove anyone who gets in their way, either by force or by political chicanery, is scary (even all these years later).And the abject corruption of the FBI is, well, just sad. Zip Connelly is one of the more compelling (albeit flawed) characters in the book. The relatively cheap price that the FBI guys extracted from Bulger is noteworthy.If you only buy one book this year, make it this one."
4,A primer on the subject...,"Many hours can be spent scouring all sorts of documents in order to gain the same amount of information Howie Carr presents in his book. Howie has gathered and distilled all his knowledge on the subject into this handy tome. Anyone moving to Massachusetts and in need to catch up on the seedy past of this Commonwealth need not go too far. And if that someone is still willing to move to Massachusetts even after reading this book, then he or she will be ready to strike up a conversation with any of the locals and fit right in. Regular listeners of the Howie Carr Show will delight in the amount of detail Howie goes into. Over the years, Howie has told many a crime tale but the book goes way beyond what he can cram into 15-minute segments. A fine read, but also an abridged encyclopaedia of crime in its own right."
5,Nobody Knows Boston Better Than Howie Carr.,"Talk show host and Herald Reporter Howie Carr has been covering politics and crime for over 30 years.His book,The Brothers Bulger is a fascinating look at the political world of exsenate president Billy Bulger and his criminal brother James Whitey Bulger.As this went to print Whitey was still at large being on the run since 1994.Whitey and his girlfriend Catherine Greig were arrested June 22 2011 and he now awaits trial at the Plymouth House of Correction in Mass.Whitey is 83 with a bad heart,so if he makes it to trial is anybodys guess.If you live in Mass this is a must have.If your not it will still make interesting reading.Soon to be a motion picture.Ben Affleck is to play Whitey.Ben Affleck is director.Sounds like an interesting project."
3,"Informative, but a bit dry","Definitely an eye opening look into organized crime and government corruption in Boston. But, Howie Carr's longtime obsession with the Corrupt Midget and his clan makes for pretty dry reading. At times it reads like a book report--bland summaries of old Globe news articles. Understandably, I'm sure Howie couldn't get interviews with most of the people involved...they're either dead, or they'd probably try to kill him! Anyway--an informative book, but kind of dull."
2,A hack job,"The story of the Bulger clan is both fascinating and disturbing, and Carr nails the grotesque story of Whitey. However, an overt bias against Billy is apparent from the outset. Carr attempts to guide the reader's reactions with overstated adjectives to describe the shenanigans of Billy and his minions, and I found Carr's style to be simplistic, biased and insulting. In short, Carr's hack job on Billy is extreme and undermines an otherwise well-done sypnosis on Whitey and his vast legion of enablers."
3,Decent Book,"The author certainly has an extensive knowledge of the subject, however, it appears as if he has some ax to grind against Billy Bulger.The history of Whitey/Stevie and the FBI is truly fascinating, disturbing and frieghtening and this is the best part of the book because it goes into more detail than previous books. However, although Billy appears to be a hard ball playing politician, the accusations against him appear to be shaky at best. I am sure he did some things he is not proud of, but what politician has not? His greatest crime seems to be that he was the brother of one of the most vicious criminals in New England history.I am not that familiar with Boston politics, however, I do know that Mr. Carr is a rabid right wing radio host, so his lense while viewing Billy Bulger may be somewhat clouded. I would recommend Black Mass and Brutal over this book."
2,Too Long and Detailed,"Carr provides a hit-by-hit detailing of every murder in Boston over a number of years - many committed by James (Whitey) Bulger. Meanwhile, his younger brother, Billy, obtained a law degree, became involved in countless acts of patronage, etc., rose to President of the State Senate, and eventually was appointed President of the University of Massachusetts.Too long and detailed. Nonetheless, the degree of scandal and violence going on in Massachusetts during the Bulgers' recent ""reign"" was incredible."
2,I guess you had to be there,"For a person not from Boston, this book was hard to follow. I grew up in upstate New York and moved to NH in 2003. This book is pretty hyped around here, so I picked it up. It did not hold my interest. So my rating is for people not from this area."
4,Whitey's not the only one who got away with murder,"What is really surprising about Carr's book is the lack of contact between the two title characters. Rather than being an expose on the links between the worlds of politics and crime, what we have instead is essentially the same character in two parallel universes. It is almost eerie how both individuals concurrently rose to power, facilitated by a similar set of circumstances and enablers. The book moves back and forth fairly easily between these two worlds, though the political side of it tends to be the easier read."
4,Oh my gosh.....,Absolutely jaw dropping. Reading this book made my hair stand up. Couldn't put the book down!
4,A Bulger retrospective.,"Living in Boston, I am very famimiar with most of the stories floating around about the Bulger Bros. Howie corrals all of the stories that I have heard, adds a few new ones, and presents the lives of Whitey and Billy in a parallel comparison. In doing so, he believably implies that the Bros. consistently helped one another to increase their power, Billy in the Senate and Whitey on the streets. An interesting read, but does not contain much new info on the two men."
1,A lasting scourge on the Boston area,"Howie Carr, I mean.I wouldn't trust Howie Carr to get a fact straight if his life depended on it. As despicable, criminal and scary as the Bulgers are, anyone who relies on Howie Carr for the facts here is just foolish.His radio and newspaper careers are riddled with examples of bigotry and inflammatory, expedient outright lies. Carr has all the intellect, integrity, and talent of the scary offspring of Rush Limbaugh and Mike Barnacle.Buyer beware!"
1,Smear,"Howie well knows,but chooses to ignore,the truism that a grand jury can always be persuaded to indict a ham sandwich. But try as they might All the Kings Men be they federal, state or local could not get a rubberstamped indictment of Billy Bulger and this fact gives Howie an ulcer. And all the kings men also includes congressional committees who basked in their public investigation of Sen Bulger and came up with scratch. Poor Howie: all full of righteous thunder and a sack full of yellow journalism."
4,CONFUSING,"This is a pretty good book. It is very confusing lately with the huge influx of books about this topic. Since the Departed has come out, everyone wants to know the real story of Whitey and Boston. Everyone is on a get rich quick thing with all these books. It is hard to judge because it seems that every new book coming out discredits the last one. I enjoyed this book, but like I said it is very confusing when you are trying to substantiate who is telling the real version of the story. I give a lot of credit to the gangsters who write the books because they were there and can tell it like it happened. That also leaves room for them to beef it up too. I guess what I am trying to say is that Carr is a writer and reporter and has done extensive research on this topic. Accurate or not, it is still a fantastic read and I think some of the fun of it all is reading the other books on this topic and trying to figure out how it really happened or who is telling the truth."
3,CONFLICTED?!,"There is some great info in this book, but at times it was like Chinese water torture. Slow but steady. I was mentally exhausted by the end of this one. I found that I was just trying to get through it rather than enjoying myself until the end. I don't know, but it just didn't grab me."
4,Interesting History of Southie's Criminal Element,"I spent my early childhood in South Boston and my father grew up there. Fighting was a way of life and my mother was shocked when my brother and I had no choice but to learn to be violent before ever stepping into a school.This book explains a lot of what was going on around me at the time; who was actually at the top of the violence chain and just how ruthless those people really were. I had been told stories growing up, particularly the one about the mobster's girlfriend being accosted at the Frolics at Salisbury Beach (contrary to Howie's reference, Salisbury is in Massachusetts). I was told that the guilty party had been tied to a chair with a hole in the seat at which point his genitals were removed using an acetylene torch.Man is not an animal? I beg to differ."
1,More rantings of a man obsessed,"Poor Mr. Carr's misguided obsession with Bill Bulger is obvious enough on his radio shows, but I had hoped he would have calmed down enough to give us real insight in a book. But the book is just a long tirade. His confusing, rambling detail shows the reader just how far Mr. Carr needed to stretch facts to meet his hysterical opinions. He gives us absolutely no understanding of what could be such an interesting story because his inflammatory accusations are so unbalanced. Ugh, more of the same one-sided talk show nonsense from a man who's obviously got a grudge for some reason and now wants to make money from it. If you're really curious, borrow it from the library. Don't waste your money."
1,A Trite and Scurrilous Diatribe,"Rarely has one ""so called author"" spread so many scandulous inferences about a good man of noble character and high integrity... ""Bill"" Bulger. For so many years with so few facts on which to base these claims. Mr Carr has wrought dishonoable income by attacking a honorable man. If Amazon Customer must learn for themselves better they should save the money a pick up this hackneyed story at their public library. After doing so, cleanse youself by viewing Jimmy Stewart in It's A Wonderful Life, an accurate closer description on the real life Bill Bulger has lived. So many of us are better off from knowing the real Bill Bulger."
4,surprising,"This is a great and well-researched book about what one of the blurbs on the cover appropriately calls ""the old boys network from hell"". Terrify stuff, but one thing that may surprise readers of Carr's columns is that he doesn't really try to be funny. Those who are used to his brutal ridicule of Bulger et al. may be surprised to find that this is mostly a work of straightforward reporting. Again, the subject matter doesn't really lend itself to mirth, but that hasn't stopped Carr before. I was hoping for more new info about H. Paul Rico, but other than that not at all disappointing.Ivan Rorick"
4,PBeck,Great book! Shows the true underbelly of the rampant corruption and greed that these men controlled. Howie Carr is a wonderful writer but the book does jump around a bit. The fact gathering involved in writing this book had to exhausting! A very hard book to put down.
4,Excellent,"Great take on one of the great true crime stories in America. A must read if you are interested in the story of Whitey Bulger, and how can you not be?"
5,Howie's got it!,"Having been in the FBI in Boston, working on the OC sqd. w/ Zip Connolly, Howies reporting is on the money. I can't get into the details, but to say, this book is on the mark. The State Police got screwed, as did the other Agents in the BS office. However, other than things Howie could not know, this book is excellent & sure worth the money!"
4,More Than About The Bulgers,"As much as a simpleton that Howie Carr is, his recounting of the Bulger brothers' lives exposes the small-minded venality that taints so much of the city. That Billy became president of UMass was puzzling to anyone who didn't know the story behind the story. Carr's explanation of how it happened and how corruption followed him put it into context.The book is an engaging read, but mostly for Bostonians and New Englanders. Carr's biases come through, but given how preposterous the situation is/was, they are overwhelmed by the bizarre nature of the facts and they are a minor annoyance that doesn't get in the way of the narrative.With a readable typeface, an engaging storyline and low amounts of concentration required to get its gist, Carr's book is great treadmill reading."
1,Inaccurate clip job,"I just finished reading BROTHERS BULGER and intend to bring it back to the book store and ask for a full refund. As someone who has followed the Bulger scene for years, I could not believe how many inaccuracies were in this book. Didn't anyone vet it? Or at least read it over? I also bought BRUTAL by Kevin Weeks and was amazed at how much I learned. That book is worth the money for sure. It's funny but Carr is a journalist and Weeks is a criminal (I saw the 60 Minutes episode with both of them and thought Carr looked like a little sneak) yet Carr has written a dishonest and inaccurate book while Weeks at least told the truth. The 60 Minutes show should have been enough to have warned me not to buy Carr's book. But you can save your money. If you want to read a clip job filled with inaccuracies, just go on Carr's website."
1,Absurd!,Carr compiled his lame newspaper articles from throughout the years and tried to pass it off as a book. I wouldn't recommend this piece of garbage to anyone. Don't waste your money on this fiction.
1,Ridiculous,"I am a South Boston native who knows the Bulger family. No, I am not a close friend, but I know enough about Bill Bulger to know that this book is rubbish. Don't waste your money, it is just a vehicle for Mr. Carr's obsession, which has somehow carried him on the air and in print for many years."
1,Who really Cares?,"Who really cares about the Bulgers? Howie will do anything to get attention and keep his carnival act going. What benefit can a person get by reading this book? Someone please tell me. It was written for no other purpose other than to make money. What a waste of good paper. There is mention of two FBI agents Nick and Charles Gianturco, one of which had Bulger and Flemmi over his house at Christmas. Howie claims that Nick is corrupt just like John Connoly. Where is his proof? If that is so then why wasn't the agent indicted and found guilty? The answer is because neither of them were corrupt....PERIOD! I have known both of theose agents for many years. They are both of the highest integrity and honesty. I suggest that people buy the book, tear out the pages and use them to line the bottom of their parakeet's cage. Howie with his cigar and cane qualifies for employment at any of the carnivals that tour the U.S."
3,Great tale documenting a hideous killer and corrupt government,"Great tale of crime gang in Boston and how national, state, and local law personnel were bought out and actually protected them. Good read on crime and politics. Some of the editing is bad, the last chapter seems almost disconnected in the book, it jarringly repeats material covered repeatedly earlier in the book. Plus the author places a lot of personal invective and leaps of assumption in the book. Carr labels almost everyone as incompetent or corrupt, usually both, except for one person he supported in a perjury case. Left wing or Democrats come in for special contempt. If you saw Billy Bulger's testimony before congress, you saw Carr behind him making faces like an elementary school student at a class picture. Filtering out the bias and assumptions traded as fact, it is a good book and documents severe corruption problems that let a serial killer go on for far, far too long."
2,thankfully its over,"this book bounced around and dragged on. i had to finish it, but it was painful to get through. howie's other book ""hitman"" was no better. stick to radio please"
5,Halarious and Outstanding,"This is everything that you would come to expect from MXC. The dialog is catchy, and stunts are halarious, and the eliminations are awesome. If you're looking for something funny to kill time or watch with your friends, then I highly recommend this."
3,Its good if you like this,i bought this everything was fine and was what it was supposed to be but in my opinion the show is funnier on tv it ruins it when your watching it on dvd some reason.
3,"Hysterical, but Better on TV","I was frustrated with my inability to see MXC on TV enough. Watching it was a random occurrence that had me laughing for hours. When I discovered that I could purchase it on DVD, I thought that it would be great. Don't get me wrong; it's funny. Having MXC on DVD, however, removes the spontaneity of true humor. I would recommend the DVDs but watch sparingly."
4,MXC Season 1 & 2,Overall this is an amazing show and a fantastic purchase. The 2nd season has some blanked out episodes due to DVD media transfer rights.
4,MXC - Seasons 1 and 2,"This is a funny, dubbed into English, Japanese Game Show. It's a good ""Guys"" program as it's a no-brainer comedy show with no social redemption. It can also be seen on Spike TV."
1,Don't Buy These!,"I bought these for jogging because I wanted something that was sweat resistant, but after only a few steps, they fell out of my ears. I had to run back to my house to switch back my ipod headphones. Honestly, it doesn't matter how they sound because they are unusable. I wish I hadn't wasted my money. Please don't make the same mistake!"
4,Nice Headphones Terrible package,"I like the earphones. Fit my ears. Sound good. However, mine arrived on Earth day and the packaging is an environmental disaster. You could easily put the headphones in a zip lock bag and leave it at that. This package was the most user UNFRIENDLY I have ever seen. I had to gnaw, hack and saw my way through several layers of waste to get at the headphones.Sennheiser its your planet too. Don't destroy it with 99% waste on the product you ship. Be a responsible company."
2,does not work as advertised,These headphones sound fantastic. However....they don't stay in your ears! How can sport headphones not stay in place. They have now been relegated to music listening at the office. I would not buy these again.
1,Poor !,"This is the poorest ear plugs I have ever had. The discomfort by wearing this is just un-real, and I can`t understand why Senneheiser would compromise themselfes by selling this. It is impossible to have these stay in your ears while moving around and you can just forget about working out since they keep popping out. POOR POOR POOR."
2,Good While They Lasted,"One side to stopped working after about 6 months (a loose connection at the 3.5mm jack plug). I'm not sure if this is typical, but I believe they could have been made sturdier. Besides them breaking, they had good sound and fit well."
2,Elephant ears,you're ears need to be huge to use these things. I read it in a reveiw before but should has listened. I feel i have pretty average ears and they keep falling out. They re more like a drum shape with no ridge or defination to keep them snug in your ear....bummer. On to next pair.PS. They do seem to sound good (but they have to stay in to hear it!)
1,Stay away ......really,"I read all the reviews before I bought them and I can't imagine that nobody mentioned that. The cord is not long enougn if you are 6 feet tall plus. I am 6 feet tall and I can't keep my MP3 player in my shorts when I run. The cord is not long enough. What do say except ....DuhThe sound is passable ( I guess, you can't really get a good sound with ear buds) but the buds are quite bulky so they don't stay in your ears. I usually don't have problem with that - the cheapest earphones stay in my ears when I run with no problemConsider the fact, that I got a good deal - $13. I still wouldn't recommend them to anybody."
2,Sennheiser MX70 Sport Stereo Headphone with Magnetic Surfaces,"True to other reviews of these headphones, there are pluses and minues. The pluses, they have a cool green color, they come with an extension cord and a smaller set of rubber speaker covers, They have a low profile outside the ear so they are comfortable when laying down on a pillow (I cannot feel them in my ears hardly at all) The sound is adequate but need to fit well to have the best bass sound experience.The minuses: they will not stay in my ears when running which made them very ""unsport"" headphones for me."
5,2 years and counting!,"I bought MX70 headphones like 2 years ago. Have used them in the office, sports, travelling, sleeping, even under rain and sound quality still as good as the day I got em.MX 70 fits my ears very good, and really love that magnetic surface since it keeps both headphones together around my neck, or in only one ear when need to do anything else.Thinking seriously on buying a new MX70's!"
4,healing........,"it's funny but you rarely find cds nowadays that is not gospel or inspirational, yet speaks to the soul. this album deals with broken relationships and the performances on here stick to your mind, body, and soul. perfect for a broken heart or lovestruck peeps."
5,Wild Orchid is wild!,Ever since I bought this CD I have been listening to it nonstop. It makes you wanna dance. Wild Orchid is the best!
2,They're alright...,"I think they're voices are wonderful, but the songs need some more work on them, don't you think? They need something different to work with. If I was around, maybe they'd really accomplish something."
3,Curious programmer has its moments,"The DVD transfer is acceptable but not good. It's better than some from Alpha.A man wakes up in a mansion with everyone believing him to be the master of the house. Apparently, the scheming wife and her boyfriend have found a perfect duplicate for her husband. They confide in him that if he will sign for bank bonds from an old friend and they will give him some of the money. What follows is a rather mixed bag of crooks, can artists and thieves. Nobody is innocent here as even the banker is trying to grab an extra 100 grand.This film is fairly interesting and should be enjoyable for old 30's movie buffs. Some pre-code moments are here as well.Recommended for: Pre-code fans, mystery and suspense fans and those who collect and enjoy early 30's movies."
4,Interesting read,"My mother was a classmate of Ms Kemner at Johns Hopkins, so we had vested interest in this book. She gives an interesting account of the trials and tribulations of being a midwife in rural Appalachia."
5,A CLASSIC FAVORITE,"I was happy to find this release,while checking on Amazon.I have the LPand it is full of clicks and pop`s.I enjoy classic rock and this is one ofmy favorite`s! It was easy to order,and I received the CD in 4 buisnessday`s.I will continue to shop with Amazon because of availabilty and service!THANK`S,M.G. BAY CITY, MI."
2,MY version sounds dulllllllllllllllllllllllll,"i bought my copy used for $12. it claims to be MANUFACTURED AND DISTRIBUTED BY MCA VICTOR, INC. JAPAN. my version sounds like it was was taken from an lp production tape.i'm comparing these tracks to ""look what i did"". what fixed it for my ears was a eq'd dub.+6db@64hz/ -4db@125hz/ -1db@ both 2k & 4k/ +1db@8k/ and +7db@16k, all others flat. i know this sounds silly but it made a BIG DIFFERENCE! as for the album itself i play it over and over. there's something special about this album. before i bought the cd, i was listening to an old NOISY lp dubbed to cd and it had the same effect on me. what i'm looking forward to next is purchasing joe's earlier material. can't wait!"
1,Worst sound quality ever,Absolutely the worst sound quality I've heard for several years on a CDTape hiss and lousy soundstaging. Do not buy this disc. I did and immediately sent it back!
5,A Masterpiece. Period.,"I'll never forget the first time I heard this album. College, 1975. A friend brought it over and said I had to hear it. Rolled it off on a reel-to-reel tape as I listened, and STILL went out and bought the album. Played the tape all the time so I wouldn't wear out the LP. It's showing its age, but I still have it and wouldn't part with it for anything. I find it incredible that MCA has not released this domestically on CD. All of Joe's albums are great, but this one is superb. If only ONE of them was available, this should be the one. Instead it's the only one you can't get. The music industry never ceases to amaze me... Thanks, Lynne, wherever you are, for turning me on to this masterpiece all those years ago!"
4,A revelation!,"I bought this after reading that this configuration of Joe's band toured with Stephen Still's Manassas in 1973. Fans raved about both, and I was already a Manassas fan, so I figured this had to be good. It's fantastic, and one of the best albums I've discovered this year!Having only limited exposure to Joe's music, this album was quite a revelation. It plays like a dream unfolding: each rich, textured song flowing seamlessly into the next. Joe and his band touch upon elements of rock, folk, country, jazz and classiscal along the journey. The musicianship is absolutely superb!Side note: This edition was supposedly mastered from the wrong tapes, but what's here isn't bad. The supposed, inserted fadeout (I've never heard the LP) between the third and fourth tracks is unfortunate. There is some tape hiss, but I don't agree that it detracts from the music.4 star album, 3 star sound (for an official remaster)."
4,HOW YA DOIN'?,"I purchased this disc based on the comments by various reviewers and, I must say, I am impressed. It is a great Joe Walsh album! Although there are a few of his that I like better, this is a very solid classic by Joe & Barnstorm. ""Turn To Stone"" is definitely the highlight on this disc and is better IMHO than the reworked version he released later. The clarity of the Japanese version is fantastic. If you are a Joe Walsh fan, do not hesitate to purchase this disc! However, if this is your first Joe Walsh disc, I would suggest purchasing ""The James Gang Rides Again"" as an initial introduction to Joe."
1,"""Creative"" editing ruins this CD","This is one of my favorite records, and I've been trying for years to get it on CD. I have the original vinyl, but those Dunhill pressings were never much good. So, I was very happy to see that the record was reissued on CD. Unfortunately, there's some tape hiss, but most distressing, track 3, ""One and One"" has been edited to fade out with a long pause between it and the next tune ""Giant Bohemoth"". On the original vinyl, these two tunes seque into each with no fadeout of any kind. The edit on the reissue totally disrupts the ""flow"" of the album. Very, very disappointing.UPDATE UPDATE UPDATE UPDATE******************Apparently this reissue was initially released using a set of incorrectly marked master tapes. The reissuing company has now found the correct masters, have cut a new digital remaster and is now circulating the corrected issue of this record."
5,His masterpiece. Period.,"The joy of spirit on this album is stunning and infectious. Unfortunately in another kingdom; long , long ago."
3,Tiny Jar,If you want one fourth cup of paint go up the street to Walmart and save a few bucks because this is off the charts costly.
5,Delicious!,This is one of the best Dark Chocolate Bars with or without sugar I have ever tasted. I even like this one better than many top of the line conventional dark chocolate bars. Tastes like a rich Gran Marnier Dark Chocolate Mousse.
2,Too Bitter for Eating,"You recommended this chocolate bar with orange bits to me, based on my past order for YC Chocolate sugar free 70% cocoa. We could not eat it; very bitter, no orange bits just the bitter zest of orange. May be great for baking BUT I do not recommend for pleasurable eating. I would not purchase this again, and you should not recommend it as an eating chocolate."
5,Blessed by Jewish Music,"Wow! This album was my introduction to some of the most beautiful soothing music I have ever heard. At bedtime I turn my CD player volumeon low and am lullibied to sleep.Now I'm looking for another similar CD. I was able to use the ""Listen""format on this one before purchase which was so helpful for me since I wasunfamiliar with the musicians. Now, although, the CD does'nt have the""listen"" option, and I'll therefore just have to trust the personal reviews, I think I will order the jewish cello and piano by Richard Loch.All I know is after listening to Chants Judif, I must have more."
3,Caught Up VHS,"Caught up is a good movie, not Great but good, I liked Woodbine's performance, And could care less if snoop made a cameo or not or whoever else. I thought it was good."
4,ISSUES,IT WAS A GOOD STORY LINE AND IT REALLY SHOWED THE COMPANY YOU KEEP CAN GET YOU IN ALOT OF TROUBLE SEE IT YOU'LL LIKE IT
3,Caught up,The movie was ok for the price.it should cost least.it is a good movie if you like action and drama movies
4,More African/American Issue,"This was basically about how ""WE"" African/Americans view ""THE GAME."" For those who choose to get into the game, realize the whole concept not just getting fast money--""THERE'S NO EASY WAY OUT.""Thank You"
1,A REALLY HORRIBLE MOVIE,This might be the most terrible movie ever made. I wouldn't wish it on my worst enemy.
5,Grieg: Piano Concerto/ Peer Gynt Suite...,"I had the good fortune to hear Grieg's Suite Number 1, Opus 46 recently on XM-Satellite radio.I never knew that Grieg was the mind behind (""Morning"") and the Piano Concerto in A Minor, Opus 16 - as both have been usedextensively over the years on Radio, Television and in film to...set the mood. But, one can't consider this music asbackground - as it stands so well!A classic, well performed by the Budapest Philharmonic and Vienna Symphony Orchestras.Conducted by Janos Sandor and Yuri AhronovitchSimply outstanding (and a great value)!I rate Grieg: Piano Concerto/Peer Gynt (Suites 1 and 2)...Five stars!"
1,This is a rip off don't buy it!,I was introduced to Brer Rabbit via Uncle Remus' stories in Song of the South. This DVD does not remotely come close to the stories told by the lovable Uncle Remus. They are watered down political correct inaccurate bla bla mindless pap. Uncle Remus' original stories had substance and wisdom I didn't find in this DVD.
1,Adventures of Brer Rabbit,"My father had asked me for The Adventures of Brer Rabbit for christmas. He wanted the original version. I thought that is what I had ordered since it said classic on the order page. I did not see where Wayne Brady was located on the cover. I simply did not pay attention. If I would have I would have known that this piece of crap was not the original. My dad hates it. He wanted it to share with his grandson. He simply removed it from the dvd player and put it in the closet. When I had made the order I only saw the title and it said classic, so I bought it. Boy was that the wrong mve....."
3,Pilot Error or Poor Instructions - Not sure which,"Well, It plugged up the hole, but I'm still not sure what the appliques sent in the package were for. After mixing, the admixture solidified so fast, it was hard to work with. The hole is plugged, it's not pretty, but at least water won't get into the lens compartment and cause a short. I wish the instructions were a little more explicit and if the admixture solidification could be slowed a little bit giving the user more time to work with it, it would be a great product. Although it was a relatively warm day when I set out on my project, I'll probably try it again in July when the weather is really hot to see if that has any effect."
1,Insane price!!!!,You are insane if you pay $35 for this media guide. This guide can usually be found on eBay for around $2-$5. I'm not sure where the seller came up with $35 for this guide that sold for $10 in 2002. Yikes!
4,Cute,I put it out when we have a party and everyone enjoys changing the songs and laughing. Its cute and fun.
2,HORRIBLE SOUND,"The Piano and the mouse are so adorable! Great Quality, but the voice of the singer SUCKED, it was one of those annoying voices that a person just couldn't bear to hear more than once."
5,Technology is not enough,"Technology can be a blessing but it can also be a curse. Neil Postman explains why, in a quite sophisticated and honest way. The book is easy reading and very interesting. It makes you think a lot about important social, cultural, and psychological issues."
4,"In the end, it's worth reading","Postman at times presents some very weak arguements, but he does cause the reader to think, and at the end of the book, he finally comes across as a rational man with a worthy cause. I highly recommend this book. Postman makes great use of the english language, and his point is worth pondering."
2,Rather Pointless,"I do not agree with many things in this book, I never really found a point to it. I will say, it did make me think of things in a different perspective that I might not of ever contimplated. Still it did not change my views of technology. I see no reason to read this other than as a college requirement."
1,Foolishness from academia,Information can be lethal and so can lack of information be lethal ... The idea that computers or media or too much information will make people less human or end childhood is just plain silly. Do you feel less human using a computer as you read this? I don't think so. Postman arguments are foolish whining without basis.
4,basic book,its a must read - even for those who would not agree that technology destroys culture. dangers are real and it is worth following the author on what they are.but technology has changed life - and not always for the worse. like climate change we dont want the scare but the reality need to be known - and thats where the importance of the book lies.
3,Pope Postman,"This book was my first encounter with Postman and I intend to read 'Amusing...'. With all the references to 'God', implicitly the Christian god, it seems Postman wants to be a self-ordained pope of a new index. For a more balanced approach I recommend Jane Healey's 'Failure to Connect', even though it focuses on computer use in education. Thand dog that no communist regime can burn Postman's book and that no pope claims it was delivered on stone tablets from a mountain top. For the opposite view, see the sadly neglected Timothy Leary's 'Chaos and Cyberculture'."
2,Boring ... nothing special,"This book is unoriginal, shallow, poorly organized, and overly wordy (he sounds like he is just rambling on, trying to sound ""learned"", but saying nothing of substance most of the time). I had to force myself to finish this one.There are several better books on the topics that are covered in ""Technopoly"" -- I would especially recommend ""Autonomous Technology"" (Winner) and ""Technological Society"" (Ellul), ""Cult of Information"" (Roszak), and ""The Arrogance of Humanism"" (Ehrenfield). These are much more in-depth, better written, and interesting."
3,Some good ideas,"Postman has written two hand-wringing books about the impact of technology on culture--this one and his earlier Amusing Ourselves to Death. This book extends his thesis from just television to other media and includes some additional material, such as a chapter on Scientism (criticizing too much faith in science as the answer to every question) and a chapter on The Great Symbol Drain (about the cheapening of our sacred symbols, as for example, using a reference to God to sell Kosher hot dogs). There are a number of good points in the book, but if you will read Amusing Ourselves to Death for the ""technology determines culture"" argument and David Shenk's Data Smog for the current look at infoglut, you'll have a more interesting and perhaps more informative experience."
4,Technopoly: Very thought provoking,Took about a month to get my book but that was the snail-mail factor probably. This book is very thought provoking. I never would havemade the ironic link between Gutenburg's press and the rise of Protestantism.
3,What would Postman say on this subject today?,"Postman discusses ""technopoly"", as technology's totalitarian grip on our culture. His arguments are sensical if not all convincing, and in buying technology's ills he tends to discount its advantages. He urges readers to ""maintain an epistemological and psychic distance from any technology, so that it always appears somewhat strange, never inevitable, never natural."" With humans endowed with large brains,keen eyesight,and hands with opposible thumbs, I cannot see how the evolution from tools to today's advanced technologies, is anything but inevitable and natural. In Postman's advice to educate focusing on the continuity of culture, he appears inflexible to the communications revolution where perhaps people have more venues to escape alienation and discontinuity of everyday life.Nonetheless, I enjoyed the read, and would recommend it for those wishing to explore the connections between technology and culture. What would Postman say on this subject today?"
2,Lack of Control,"While I totally disagree with Postman's view that Technology is somehow a hulking stalker-in-the-night creature that is stealing away our values and culture, his point is though-provoking, if overly dramatic. While Postman has an entertaining wit and humor, his information is often awry and misguided. Though his point that technology must be examined, questioned, and taken control of by humanity is one that should be taken up and heralded by us all, the idea of technology on its own taking over our lives is entirely off base. Read this book if you want to ask questions about the ongoing technological ""advances,"" but don't expect any clear answers, or, for that matter, any real information."
2,Interesting ideas that have little to do with technology,"Postman discusses things that he finds wrong with the world, but there is very little connection between these ideas and technology. However, if you're interested in these things, then parts of this book might be a good read: * why opinion polls are not useful (Chapters 5, 8); * why efficiency and progress are not worthy goals (Ch. 3); * why human qualities cannot be ranked or measured (Ch. 1, 8); * why statistics do not often reflect reality (Ch. 8); * whether or not social science is really a science (Ch. 9); * why you should distrust medical doctors (Ch. 6); * why traditions and religious narratives should not be thrown away (Ch. 3, 9, 10); and * how education could improve society (Ch. 11)."
1,DO NOT BUY ANY VERBATIM HARD DRIVE,"I purchased this product, not via amazon, but locally. It lasted three months before the hard drive died, making a loud clicking sound. I called verbatim support, refused to help me without my original receipt. Didn't matter if I supplied a serial number on the product. It was summed up to me as no receipt, no support. Stay away from them as they will not warranty there products."
3,wet noodle,"Good price for bars, can't see spending 60 bucks. But these bars will bend like a noodle if your bike falls over for any reason. Easy fix though, you can just bend them back on the bike. If you ride any aggressive off road go with the higher quality."
2,Overrated Film,"I watched Spike Lee's ""Do The Right Thing"" last night and was terribly disappointed. Nobody changes throughout this movie. In fact, Lee's one-dimensional characters live up to the stereotypes that Lee is desparately trying to give them. You have Pino, the racist Italian; Lee, who himself is the protypical lazy black man and racist himself; Aiello, was is the fiery owner of the pizza place, etc. Lee starts the riot that leads to the pizza joint's demise, and we don't know why he does this. Pino was right all along, according to Lee: people in this neighborhood CAN'T be trusted, can they? Question: who WOULDN'T have smashed Radio Rahemm's radio after he walks back into the pizza place blasting his boom box? It seems like a perfectly logical solution. It's not Aiello's fault that Raheem is killed by the police. Kind of a witless ending to a somewhat promising premise."
4,A Straight-Forward Spike Lee Joint,"The best thing about Spike Lee's films is that he expresses his thoughts very directly, and yet without giving in to the temptations of including easy effects like explicit violence.'Do The Right Thing' is basicly about stupidity. Stupidity that leads to intolerance. Stupidity that escalates because of... stupidity.A very honest film about reciprocal racism, and therefore one of the better on the subject!A straight-forward Spike Lee Joint."
3,Fairly decent story and good acting,"I remember being very excited to see this film after all the press it received when it came out.. However, I was disappointed by it somewhat. A much better movie than ""School Daze,"" it still wasn't as clever in its way as his first film, ""She's Gotta Have It."" At least Criterion is again attempting to present some contemporary films. Everything they have put out in the last year has been restorations of films from the 30s for some weird reason."
2,Skip this one. He does the wrong thing.,"I got nothing against Spike, but his later work like He got game and Malcolm X are better than snapshot of a day in Brooklyn."
5,Classic drama depicting ridiculous racism,Spike Lee came through big time in this classic.An interesting look at Brooklyn back in the day.Can't we all just get along?
5,His Finest Joint!!,"Spike Lee brought race relations front and center with his first commercial success. The soundtrack from Public Enemy gives the movie its fire. The performances of Danny Aiello, John Turturo, Rosie Perez and many others gives the movie its power. This movie should have been given more praise by the Oscar community. It's a shame that Aiello was the only nominee. It was clearly the best movie of the 1989. Unfortunately, Hollywood has a beef with movies that are made in New York."
4,"Why You Should See ""Do the Right Thing""","I admit it. The first time I ever saw this film was in my Film class, and it was being taught by Mr. Webster: ""Do the Right Thing"" worshipper. So maybe I am a wee bit biased when I say that this is a supremely superb movie. But it is indeed a supremely superb movie, and I encourage you to see it! Spike Lee does a masterfull job directing, screenwriting, and starring in this film. The basic summary is ""a day in a predominately black neighborhood in Brooklyn"". It incorporates every racial tension you can imagine, and every small conflict is leading up to the heartstopping climax at the end. See it!"
3,Shock treatment.,"Spike Lee is no Orson Wells. He is an average director but his writing is very flimsy. His acting is on the level of Quentin Tarrentino. What he can do is create shocking images. His 'joints' are not art, but rather like watching car crash footage, disturbing but not enriching."
3,#1 Worst Ending Ever,"A powerful story that suffers from, in my opinion, the worst epilogue ending in movie history. Spike Lee could have simply ended the story as the flames shot up, but no, he has to bring his character back to meet with the shop owner the day after and they kiss and make up. This after Spike character tossed a trash can through the storefront window to ignite the riot."
1,A good idea sadly realized,"Unfortunately for Mr. Lee, I think this film backfired in a lot of people's eyes. I am a Latino American, but by the end of the film I had way more respect for Sal and the Korean family than I did for the black characters unfortunately. Radio Raseem and Buggin' Out where violence instigators and harassing troublemakers who had no business telling Sal who he should put on his wall. Mookie is nothing but a degenerate loser who deserved a beating, as well as the mentally challenged half white half black idiot walking around stuttering about Malcolm X and Dr. King.Sal was only defending his business and the right to be proud of his heritage. The wisest words come from the Korean store clerk who tells a bunch of racist old farts ""You...me...we same!""This film wanted to delve into the roots of racism and say that no side is guilt-free, but this is unlikely to happen when Lee is the director. He obviously favored his character."
2,argh i hate this movie,"i respect spikes attempt at dealing with difficult issues, but this movie is not interesting or enjoyable. this movie, like he got game, is ruined by constant agruing between every character. the whole movie is one big stupid argument! it gets old after twenty minutes. jungle fever, however, is an excellent movie, worth owning in my opinion. i just dont understand why every movie critic loves 'do the right thing.'"
3,This is a dumb movie!!!!,"I didn't understand it back then and I still don't understand it now it represents black people in a very negative way!!!! I enjoy most of Spike's movies but this one I really didn't all this film shows is the negative lives of black people and I don't think that this is the way that all black people live I am sure that Spike is a pround black man and that he doesn't portray all black people like this!!!! We all don't like to live this way it is up to the person to live the way that they would like to live so ""So please don't believe the hype.Last, I enjoyed School Daze but it ended very stupid and so did this movie!!!!"
2,Do the right thing...avoid this movie,"I would not go so far as to say this movie is terrible. I would say it is self-important, immature, obvious, and overwhelmingly one-sided. It seems Spike Lee does not believe there are any white people alive who are not either stupid, racist, phony, or downright evil. I had a bad feeling about this movie as it started off with 4 1/2 minutes of a sleazy looking woman having a seizure accompanied by bad music. Then 4 minutes of an inane morning dj spouting a string of unconnected meaningless words. Lee had his moments, but it was pretty much a 2-hour music video.Spike Lee doesn't mess with fantasy, only with reality and his reality is black and white. It is infact fantasy, and pure propaganda."
1,stupid,The story had no plot.I couldn't believe how stupid it was.I wouldn't waste my money or time on this.If you want my copy i would be happy to give it to anyone who would want it.
1,Spike Lee is a Racist,He believes Blacks are the superior race. Thats pretty much the definition of racisim.
4,Spike Lee's Do the Right Thing: A look into American Racism,"Spike Lee's Do the Right Thing is a riveting look into the life of a multi-cultural block in New York City. The film's theme song "" Fight the Power"" is the repeated point that reveals the true meaning behind the movie. Characters weave in and out of the film leaving the audience with a sense of knowledge and caring for each and every one of them. The hottest day in NYC serves as a colorful backdrop for the group of diverse characters. Lee's portrayal of Mookie, a lazy pizza delivery man, allows the audience to follow his struggle to co-exist in the tense world. The climax and finale of the film is a heartstopping sequence that thrusts a multitude of hatred at the audience. The film leaves one in a slight state of shock and gets it's point across very clearly."
4,A neat book and an overly neat kayak builder!,"This book is a pretty comprehensive and helpful overview of wood strip kayak building, although for my liking the designs are pretty dated. There are more modern building methods around, but this is a solid treatment of the subject nevertheless. The author would have to be the neatest builder I have ever seen, alternatively all the shots are staged. I cannot believe someone keeps his workshop so clean and neat!!"
4,Good book,"This is a good book, very informative, more techincal than Nick Schade (bought both at the same time). This and Schade's book go very well together."
5,Excellent Book,"Excellent bood for the novice to the experenced. If you are looking for a book full of those little time saving techniques that result into a great kayak, this is the book. Ted takes you through all the steps from setting up a straight jig to applying fiberglass in a way that eliminates most of the sanding. The kayak as presented is strong and durable for most expedition and general kayak use. If one wants to increase the strenght, there are many references on the Internet that would enhance those desires. Notwithstanding, Kayakcraft rates up there as one of the best ""how to"" books."
3,Kayakcraft review,I own the Kayakcraft and Canoecraft books. I had little trouble following the tables in the canoecraft and I was able design other canoes. The Kayakcraft book seems to offer useful information for construction but the tables leave me stumped. No doubt they are hoping to sell plans along with the book.
3,I CAN'T TAKE IT,"Billy Ray is ok. I bought this for 'Party All Night'. And I kinda like 'Dish It Out'. But, I wish Jimmy Lewis would go back to writing like he did in the beginning of his career."
1,Which dark forces paid for this bull...?,"This cover is a TOTAL MISREPRESENTATION of the Bulgarian culture!I have not read this book and I do not intend to waste my time, but judging by this picture, I figure the author is either mentally disabled or paid by the tourist industry competition of Bulgaria.Bulgaria and its gorgeous beaches were the number 1 tourist destination in Europe for Summer'2002. I would not be surprised if its ski resorts repeat this achievement this winter. And don't get me started on the richness of Bulgarian culture and history, because the 1000 words limit is way too... limiting.DO NOT BUY THIS BOOK, unless you like to be lied to..."
1,the cultures of the world :the roma culture,The children on the cover are roma not bulgarian.The roma minority DO NOT CONSIDER THEMSELVS TO BE PART OF BULGARIAN NATION OR CULTURE.Nothing against them they have their oun culture which is very rich and interesting...but has nothing in common with the bulgarian culture.
1,"Ohhh, poor old lady...","A total misrepresentation of the Bulgarian Culture starting with the picture on the cover of the book. If you want to learn something about that country and its rich history and culture, you better look somewhere else..."
2,"Rather inane, somewhat humorous","If you are looking for humor, there are better sources elsewhere. If you are looking for an understanding of life, please take the trouble to read something more substantial. I admit that I found some of the passages funny (hence the two stars!!). If you are at an airport waiting for a flight and not in the mood to start anything ""weighty"" or long - this is perhaps the book for you. But I don't think you would read it a second time - I would not."
4,Fun to read,The original of this book was fun to read. It really makes you think about what kids know and what we have forgotten. I have been recommending this to friends since I read it earlier this year. A Great Read!
4,Random book!,"I must say that I really haven't ever read a book this random... In short, it is a journal of Fulghum's thoughts--on everything from a deaf boy raking the leaves in his backyard, to watching a man setting up a Valentine's display in his store window.The one thing I didn't like about the book was that it didn't focus so much on kindergarten, which was the reason I bought it. Despite that, it was a warm, light-hearted book to read. Fulghum may be a little ""random,"" but his thoughts are refressing. Overall, a fun book."
1,Too Plain,"I found the reading a bit boring. My teachers had recommended it saying it was hilarious! No fun at all for me! It seems as if the author has led his pen fly through the pages and write whatever came to his mind. Whatever! It looks like a personal diary , no worth publishing! I've read similar books but found them much more interesting e.g 'Chicken soup for the soul' series"
1,Developmentally challenged.,"Pulleese,Fortunately, many of us have continued to mature beyond the simple truths of a kindergartener. I've read better columns in Reader's Digest while in the W.C."
2,blah,Mostly rambling nonsense. Felt like the time I spent reading this was wasted. Here's a guy who says his hero is that nut that tied a bunch of helium balloons to his lawn chair and made his way onto the list of people likely to be darwin award candidates!
3,Meh...,"It started out great; the first few pages really had me intrigued. Then it turned into this overdramatic compilation of random short stories that somehow applied to the first few pages?? Great stories for discussion in a classroom, sure. But I'm not in school. Overall I wouldn't not recommend the book, I just don't think it really drove home the point implied by the title."
5,One of my favorites!,"Fulghum offers a unique insight on student learning. Heartwarming, upbeat, and right on the point. This is a read that anyone besides educators will enjoy."
3,Misleading,Know that this title is just one of the poems in the book. Don't purchase this thinking that you'll get a book full of other stories like the one you can just find online.
5,a book of true inspiration,This had to be my favorite book for so many years. i had to convince myself to put it down or the pages would wear thin.
4,All I Really Need to Know I Learned in Kindergarten,Great book! I enjoyed reading it very much! Would reccomend this book for all!
1,Plato and Socrates aren't here,"Ugh. Drivel. The book's opening pages are humorous and even sensical. The remainder is less than thought provoking. Chapters are little life-stories that present a lesson in the end. Reading the life stories is much like watching you r neighbor's Nebraska vacation slide show. At least I can set the book down without appearing rude. If you're searching for intellectual stimulation, please hit your browser's ""back"" button."
1,What Else Would a First-Grader Say?,"Actually, the heading above is a bit harsh. The language used is (a little) too rich for a first-grader - it's only the content that warrants such an audience.- Never eat raw sewage.- Treat every dog like a dog.- Don't cross the street in front of a fast moving car.- Clip your nails when they get too long.- Don't stand naked outside in the winter.- Keep legs and arms inside when on a roller-coaster.- Don't spit at a man with a gun.- Eat your spinach (unless you don't like it).I started to read the first couple of chapters of this book (as a courtesy to the gift-giver), only to wake up with a start 17 hours later.Let me open the book to a random page ... ""Place your bet somewhere between haste-makes waste and he who hesitates is lost."" Does this guy write Horoscopes, too? Fortune Cookies?Let me open the book to another page ... Zzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzz"
2,Have to disagree,"During the twelve minutes it took me to read this in the thrift shop, I found several statements that are of dubious worth. Milk and cookies are not good for the large number of people who suffer from lactose intolerance and struggle with obesity. Flushing five valuable gallons of potable water each time you use a toilet is not necessary or recommended in every situation, as well. Taking naps in the afternoon can disrupt one's sleep pattern at night and is hardly recommended for young, healthy adults. Fulghum should have stuck to rules governing social interaction rather than issue blanket statements on health, diet, and the environment that can hardly apply to all situations."
2,Fluff and nuttiness,"Fulghum takes many potentially meaningful life experiences and reduces them to accessible, palatable superficiality -- the stuff worthy of Hallmark greeting cards. He needs to get to grade school at least, but college? Out of the question, I'm afraid. Fluff for these nutty times, indeed"
3,good,"The book was in decent condition when recieved. It was older than expected, but that didnt take away from the laughter and enjoyment."
5,"Not Socrates, but it works!","Thanks to all the ""complex"" thinkers that continue to attack Fulghum's best-seller. Although Fulghum chooses to write from a simple voice, he also touches on universal themes we can all identify with. Some people need more intellectual stimulation, and if you're that type, pick up Kant, Nietsche, or Carlyle. For those of you who want a simple, easy laugh, grab this book. I'd rather read this book when I'm trying to relax any day."
3,Bang for the Buck,"Weighing in at a mere $2.50, this Dover edition is a little on the lean side. No frills, but the text is easy to read and the bottom of the page notes are adequate. Go elsewhere for indepth analysis."
3,Blueprint,"Playscripts are more like blueprints than finished products, and this one is no exception. I just last weekend saw a wonderful production of ""Winter's Tale,"" but when I just read it, it was disappointing. Nevertheless the printed version was useful to me because I don't hear well and reading the script in advance helped me to miss fewer lines in the production."
5,2 THUMBS UP!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!,"I GIVE THIS CD MORE THAN 2 THUMBS UP. WHENEVER JOHN MAKES A CD. IT IS ALWAYS GOOD. THIS CD IS ONE OF MY FAVOIRTE CD. I LOVE EVERY SONG. THE LEAD VOCALS ARE GREAT. ""FIGHT EVERY BATTLE"" IS MY FAVORITE AND THE BEST SONG ON THIS CD. IF YOU DONT HAVE THIS CD THEN YOU ARE MISSING OUT ON A BLESSING. THIS CD IS A BLESSING. YOU WONT BE DISAPPOINTED. JOHN P KEE IS THE MAN WHEN IT COMES TO MUSIC. HE ALWAYS MAKES AWESOME CD AND THIS IS ONE OF THEM. I LOVE IT!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!"
4,It's pretty good; typical John P. Kee type songs,"I guess for someone who has all of John P Kee's music, there wasn't anything surprising or particularly exciting about the album. My top 3 songs are Anyday, Thy LovingKindness, and Hold On, although at the end of Hold On, there is a part where the choir messes up."
3,"This is the same music as ""Compact Favorites"" CD","This is exactly the same music as presented on the ""Compact Favorites"" CD.And there is absolutely no way to know this in the product description.Very disappointing."
1,Disappointment,"The story line from the Series on TV was not continued with the 'way I had hoped?""Soalme's d. gets her two children by other men. having affairs just as her mother did. and when her father dies, she sticks with her husbands friends and family. with time the characters who were in the Series are all replaced by others, so the whole 'set-up' changes. I had hoped for her to become a respectiable wife, mother and make some big 'Happening' that stood out But that didnot take place. She becomes a sneaky, plotting whinning, female who seeks to get her way and goes about gaining what she wants by 'less respcetiable' behaviour."
3,Only half good,"This USB/Firewire Combination kit works fine in the USB mode, but the Firewire side does not respond. I should have listened to the previous purchasers comments. Several said that the Firewire part did not work very well. I guess you live and learn. I still use the USB part of it."
3,dont be fooled,"This is a great DVD for Lady Gaga fans who want to hear about her history etc. Unfortunately the DVD DOES NOT contain any of her videos except for 2 sec clips, a Major disappointment because that was why I bought it. Why do I feel I've been scammed, Might have guessed, because it is not endorsed by Lady Gaga, hence copyright infringement. Save your money for when the Real DVD's come out, eventually."
1,"""Glamourpuss"" falls short","A disappointment. This video is a collection of interviews from industry people who have worked with Lady Gaga or reviewed her work, but it is a far cry from being a worthwhile purchase. My recommendation is not to buy this disc."
5,Excelente,"Este disco, sin duda es lejos el mejor de Cerati en este último tiempo. Para los que no estan familiarizados con lo nuevo del ícono de Soda Stereo, este cd suena bastante raro y algo eclectico porque mezcla sutilmente lo electrico, lo unplugged con algunas notas que me recuerdan a Soda Stereo en sus días de gloria.Cerati lo vuelve a hacer y este disco es perfecto, personalmente recomiendo poner oído a Cosas Imposibles, Sulky (un tanto etnico) y Artefacto.El disco es si promete. Suena atractivamente melodioso.... innovador y ansiado para sus seguidores."
5,Suerte que existe Cerati,"Pocas veces en mi vida escuché un CD tantas veces y, a la vez, encontré cosas distintas en cada ocasión. Melodías justas, guitarras en su lugar, ritmo hipnótico y voces sumamente cuidadas. Un álbum definitivamente completo e introspectivo.Por suerte existe en América latina gente que puede brindarnos semejante calidad musical. Suerte que existe Cerati..."
2,Poco bueno entre 17 temas,"Cerati tuvo su mejor época a principios de los noventa, Dynamo y Sueño Stereo con Soda y su trabajo solista Amor Amarillo, contienen sus mejores experimentos y estilos más logrados.Bocanada ya no me gustó, su disco sinfónico me pareció ridículo, y este último, tiene buenas intenciones, muchos temas tienen cosas interesantes, empiezan bien, pero son arruinados por malas letras, malas melodías, o simplemente se descarrilan despues del primer minuto.Si hubiera reducido los temas a 10, y sacado tanto relleno mediocre quizás estaría a la altura de las obras que me mencioné anteriormente y que pueden ser escuchadas de principio a fin."
1,De mal gusto,"De todo lo que hizo Cerati en su carrera esto es lo peor. Solo Cosas Imposibles tiene algo de coherencia, el resto del disco es fallido intento de estar a la supuesta última moda (electrónica), lleno de mal gusto y de pretensión. Los temas arrancan de forma atractiva para despues deshacerse en una nada, que lleva al todo por debajo de la mediocridad.En los early 90's Cerati tuvo un momento de brillantez que se apagó ya hace tiempo."
1,It sucks big time,"Except for the first 2 or 3 songs, the rest is pure uninspired trash, trying to be trendy in terms of sounds, but totally empty musically.Cerati was good up to and before the split with Soda. Instead of this buy his first solo album, Amor Amarillo, it's inspired and original."
4,CERATI ES LA PUNTA DE LANZA DEL POP-ROCK LATINO,"CERATI PROPONE, EXPERIMENTA, DESCUBRE, AGREGA, SUSTRAE, TRIUNFA. ADEMAS SUS LETRAS SON POESIA CON VERDADES DE CRUDA SINCERIDAD. ALGUNOS DE SUS TEMAS SON PROFUNDAMENTE INTIMOS Y CASI INDESCIFRABLES, PERO EN ESO RADICA SU BELLEZA. CERATI NO HACE MUSICA FACIL DE DEGLUTIR O DIGERIR, ES UN HERMOSO RETO DESCUBRIRLO."
4,Movie/TV Music,"I came across this fellas music from an HBO Latino Special that featured his music on this program. And from the credits at the end of the program I was able to obtain his name and the title to his CD album. I researched it on the net and got to a website that allowed one to hear a part of all of the songs on this CD and I was hooked on it. I ordered it on-line and introduced it to my wife and we listened to it on our SUV's CD system. And from then on we were hooked on his music. Recently we took a weekend sojourn to our state's coastal area and listen to it while driving there and we ""CRANKED"" it up. And also listened to it on our return and have been listening to it every since. We are in our mid-50's and thoroughly enjoy this artist's music."
1,shakira,I only know of this guy because he worked with Shakira so I decided to look him up. This album is as bad as Oral Fixation Two!
1,Not Another One!,"I am SO TIRED of the ""Now.."" CDs I could scream. Outside of Independant Women, there is not one thing on here I would willingly listen to. ""Stronger"" is not music, ATC belongs back in Sweden or where ever the heck they're from, and Lenny Krvitz has been washed up for years. If they're honestly going to continue ""Now"" they need to have separate categories ""Now.. Rap"" ""Now...Pop"" ""Now..Rock/Alternative,"" etc. When NOW...3,000,000 comes out (Probably next month,)I'm going throwing my CD player out."
3,Now that's what I call confusing!,"The concept of this CD might appeal to people with no particular interest in a specific music style; it has all the chart-toppers and popular songs, but there is no connection between the songs and you end up feeling you are listening to the radio. The first 12 tracks are popular songs including Billboard #1 Hits from previous months; and I have the feeling the other 7 have been added to this compilation to give a more sophisticated look. I think it's pretty hard to recommend a song (depending on your taste you probably will like couple of them anyway!), this CD is definetely worth the money though."
5,Great compilation of songs,Now cd's are a great way to get all the current hits on one cd. It has all styles and genres on it so there is something for everyone.
4,Now Rox Now And Forever,"Cool! I love the songs like Independent Woman and Love Don't Cost A Thing and Beautiful Day and I LOVE Yellow. Yellow is the sweetest song. Buy this! You can get a whold bunch of really cool songs in one cd, which ROXXXX!! luv ya...... pros: upbeat rhythym, stuff that you can dance to, sweet tunes, and EVERYTHING you want."
5,Around the world (La La La La La),"This CD was great. I personally don't like some of the songs, but there are enough good songs to make up for it. The two best songs (in my opinon) are Around The World (La La La La La) and AM raid Io. Great for any music fan"
3,Mostly innocent,"I usually let my kids buy the NOW cds. When my daughter brought home #6 with Shaggy's song on it, I was very disappointed. Usually the music is appropriate for all ages, but the Shaggy song is DEFINITELY not appropriate for young teens and pre-teens! If they left this song off, I would have rated it higher."
1,this is good example...,"This is a good example of what will become of the world if we won't do anything about. Britney Spears, Nsync, Backstreet Boys?! Overproduced, overrated teeny-boppers are invading us. Sure some people say they look ""hot"", but to me, at least, it won't cover there talentless bodies. Britney Spears came out with a pepsi commericial. Oh, how I'd love to see her hair catch on fire just like Michael Jackson's did when he did his commercial. Britney Spears is trying to be all these legends of pop/rock music,(Jacko,Janet, Madonna, Stones,etc,) and it drives me crazy since I love Miss Jackson, and Miss Spears shouldn't get credit for doing her dance moves. The only good song is Independent Women I, and I won't increase my rating with that, because I have that single myself. ""It wasn't me"" was good, but I heard it so much I got sick of it. Shaggy now has ""Angel"" released, which proves how outdated this cd is. If I were you, spend your money on real pop, like the legends I listed above."
4,allright cd,"ok, I don't care much for the nsync, britney, and destiny's child tracks, as i dont care for them at all. ATC's ""all around the world"" is probably by far my favorite track. Theyre one of my favorite artists, and if you enjoyed that song, you'll prolly like their album ""planet pop""!"
3,Not As Good As It Should Be,"I bought this album the day it was relesed. It was going along great until I got to Shaggy's ""It Wasn't Me"".Where did the ""naughty"" lyrics go? Last time I heard the song, this guy wasn't just ""kising"" this girl on the sofa! Then, they drop the short rap from 3LW's song, and THEN they cut about 1 & 1/2 minutes from R. Kelly's song & edit THAT, too! What is the point of ruining good music like this? If they didn't have room, maybe they should have dropped a few songs instead & put them on NOW 7 (which is a sure thing). But, all in all, this compilation was pretty good. Strong (and not messed-up) songs include ""Stonger"" by Britney, ""Gotta Tell You"" by Samantha Mumba, and ""Love Don't Cost A Thing"" by Jennifer Lopez. Let's hope NOW 7 doesn't get similar treatment."
4,Not too hard on the brothers,"This book stung a bit, but it was not too hard on the brothers. The author told the stories from her point of view, but gave credit where credit was due and taxed brothers when deserved. I dig how she did't hate on all men. I would recommend this book for entertainment purposes only, don't read too much into it."
4,"Inspiring ""La Campanella""","I found the DVD extremely inspiring in the way in which Kissin makes all of the pieces look so easy :) I agree with other critics in that so much more could have been of the documentary itself but the encores at the proms make up for the lack of detail / information in the earlier parts.The two particular pieces I most enjoyed were ""A Grand Waltz - Chopin"" (great introduction by him :) ) and ""La Campanella"" (the latter of which I will never play even if I had several lifetimes!)."
2,Kissin piano music,"So, so, piano is to brilliant, Kissin rushes all the time, therae are incomplete works like Libestraum, color not that good sound too brilliant, there are better piano videos such as Bunun, Perahia an of course Horowitz not very recommended"
4,Great book!,"Simple drawings, accompany simple mechanisms. This is a great book for learning basic mechanical princibles. There is not alotof theory and formula. This is a excellent introduction to building automata. I use this book in my kinetic sculpture classes and it works well. My only critique is that the oneelectronic diagram is confusing and, well not drawn in a correct manner. But hey! This is not an electronics book. A great addition to the kinetic sculptors library."
5,Excellent book!!,Very nice graphics. It is not a academic book. It is useful to catch some ideas for home projects. It covers several basic mechanisms. I had an issue with shipping but seller service was excellent! Its service was fast and effective. Two thumbs!!
5,moog ball joint,moog ball joints best for the price. so far so good now have over 100000 and still pass inspection. on an f350 4x4 work truck
4,The proper replacement part,"I received item as advertized, it is the correct replacement part, I installed myself with the proper ball joint installation press and had no issues. I made two separate orders for this item, one arrived in great condition, the other ball joint had arrived in a bigger packaged but the small parts (zerk fittings, dust boot, nut, & snap ring) were scattered throughout he big box it was shipped in, but all the pieces were present luckily. I would highly recommend this purchase due to exceptional pricing."
5,Worked for me!,"Ordered this for my 2000 Ford F-250 4x4, diesel. Fits perfect and looks like it'll last for a while."
3,Interviews with Roswell witnesses,"Interviews with the principal witnesses and investigators of the alleged UFO crash at Roswell, including Walter Haut, Kevin Randle, Glenn Dennis, Don Ecker, Vicki Cooper & others. This video is useful as a supplement to the Randle & Schmitt books on Roswell. There is no information in the video that you will not find in the books, but it is interesting to see the witnesses give their own testimony."
1,Disatisfied canaster player,Noise too loud when shuffling. Activating bar too high. When pulling out shuffler cards hits bar causing more loud noise!
2,Practically Worthless,"You would think that a card shuffler would shuffle the cards alternately from the two sides into one pile. Most of the time the shuffler is doing nothing. Then it will kick in and send a stack of 5 to 20 cards from one side or the other, and then sit and spin for a while before it sends another stack of 5 to 20 cards. To effectively and randomly shuffle the cards, one would have to put the deck or decks through at least 8 to 10 times. This was a waste of money."
1,No Good!,"We've gone through 5 of these shufflers. They break down in 2 days to 2 months. They are very inexpensive, but I see why."
4,shuffles OK but LOUD,"Our family has had a Brookstone World Series of Poker 2 deck shuffler for several yrs. First, those who could shuffle kidded us wimps who used the shuffler. Over time, everybody has come to enjoy the shuffler during game nights when we play round after round. We decided we needed one at the beach condo, so I ordered the Bicycle version, thinking the people who made cards would make a good shuffler. The shuffler works fast & does a fine job, though an occasional card gets hung. Another reviewer is right that the button you push to operate the shuffler could have been better placed somewhere besides right where the drawer goes in & out. The main criticism we have is that the thing is LOUD. Right out of the box, it sounded like turning on a high speed blender or sink disposal. I would try another brand next time."
4,Shuffle Miracle,"I suffered a debilitating injury 4 years ago. I had an accident and I became a quadraplegic. I'm described as a functioning quad, which simply means I have some movement of my arms an legs. Although I am very lucky in that respect it didn't help my small motor reflexes. I became interested in bridge and moved on from beginner bridge to more complicated kinds. The problem was I was unable to shuffle. Although in duplicate bridge shuffling isn't necessary, in order to become more efficient one needs to practice. I now play by myself, shuffling the cards with my Bicycle card shuffler and becoming much more proficient at my game."
4,Good quality for the price!,"Bought this for our lunch-break uno game at the office, it mostly fails to shuffle the non laminated Uno cards. However we tested it with some pvc Bicycle brand playing cards and it performs flawlessly. Wish there was somewhere to get a set of PVC Uno cards!It jams the uno cards because being unlaminated they tend to have more cohesion, sticking to each other. The laminated cards are slick and slide easily over each other so it never jams with them! In contrast to a cheaper 6 deck shuffler we bought first this one is pretty great."
1,Subpar quality on Bicycle shuffler,"On our second new shuffle, first was returned cause it failed to merge both decks, & golly its replacement malfunctions in the same way....one side completes well before the other. Would give em a Zero score but (1) one is the lowest available."
3,Two deck card shuffler,"the principal is good but the shuffler will feed in one side almost twice as fast as the other side. this is consistant so shuffling is not good. the card tray will set down on the shuffle switch while it is being removed causing the shuffler to start. A raised section above the switch would hold the tray off the switch and cure the problem. also a better way to get a hold on the tray would be more convient. as it is now, probably does not save any time, may even take longer."
3,card shuffler,The card shuffler works as expected but it did not come with a tray to put in the slot to easily remove the cards after shuffled. We bought this shuffler to replace one we had but broke after we dropped it. Our original shuffler had a card tray and we expected the one we bought to have one too. I do not know if the tray was accidentally ommitted or was never intended to be part of the shuffler. If it was never to be then I am disappointed because the picture looks like there is a tray and not having one is very inconvenient and cheap. If I knew there would be no tray I would not have bought this shuffler.
4,card shuffler,"Could no longer find this item locally. Amazon had several varieties. This is very efficient, durable, and mixes cards thoroughly. Useful when playing virtually any card game. While somewhat noisy, the duration of the shuffle is brief."
3,Bicycle Shuffler,The Bicycle shuffler failed after about 20 shuffles. The vendor immediately sent a replacement which I received within 5 days. The replacement unit seems to be working fine.
1,Don't Bother!,I bought this for my elderly mother who lives in assisted living because she and her friends have trouble shuflingcards. The first one I bought didn't work at all so I returned it and received a replacement. The replacement broke after just two days. This product is cheap and I would not bother purchasing it. I will say that Amazon made the returns and refund back to my account easy. That was the only positive.
1,Broken,"One side of the card shuffler was broken so my granddaughter could not use it. There were no papers with the item when I received it, therefore, I'm assuming it cannot be returned. Probably will not order from Amazon again unless it is returnable."
2,Inferior shuffler,"The shuffler battery cover kept falling off until I taped it down. The shuffler often pulls in several cards at a time and gets stuck.The side openings seem to be too large. Less frequently the cards come into the tray at right angles, requiring manual intervention. I have bought this shuffler before, and it worked much better--manufacturing quality control seems to be somewhat lacking."
2,You get what you pay for,It broke after about 30 shuffles. Spend a little more a find a more durable shuffler. It's not worth the time to repackage it for a replacement. Amazon is the best for returns can't complain about that.
3,Deal me out,Bicycle is a card player's brand but this is made in China and I found the battery clips for the 9v battery to be inadequate as well as the loose fitting battery cover which may require some taping to keep in place. I expected more from the Brand.
1,You get what you pay for!,"I ordered this for my mom since she has pseudo gout in both of her wrists. We only need two decks shuffled for a family game we play, so I figured Bicycle would be a reliable brand. About a month after purchasing the item, we went to use it and it did not work at all. It would only work if you put one card in at a time and only one of the wheels was even functioning. I looked at the return information and I was past the 30 days by 3 days. I ended up spending more on shipping to return this item, than I even spent on it. Luckily, I received an email from Amazon today stating that I would be getting a refund for the item and the shipping to send the return. That made up for the disappointment in this item.My suggestion to those that are looking for a shuffler, DO NOT purchase this one!"
3,Shuffler needs improvement,"The shuffler works fine, merging cards in an every-other pattern. However, because the button that operates the shuffler is directly below the tray that holds the shuffled cards, when you try and pull the tray of sorted cards out of the unit, you have to lift the tray - up over the operation bar, and then a few cards hang up inside the unit at the top of the tray opening. This takes the fun away, as you struggle to remove the card tray and other cards. Seems like the time you save by using the unit, is taken away, trying to get the cards out of it.Wish they would improve the design."
1,"Cheap plastic, noisy, not well thought","This product is made of a very cheap plastic. It looks awful. If it would have worked well, then, this aspect wouldn't matter, but it's not the case.The machine is noisy, and it is absolutely not well designed. When your card are shuffled, you struggle to get them out! the suffle ""bouton"" (a big plastic peace) blocs the recipient!!!I wouldn't recommand buying this object."
2,Loud and bizarre,"To start, it's important to remember that for the most part, this item does what it's supposed to do -- shuffle cards.But there are two main reasons we don't really use it:1. It is very loud2. The design feels very cheap and unintuitiveSo while it works just fine, it sits on my shelf untouched in some time. Sad to say, I probably would not purchase it again."
2,I should have read ALL the Amazon reviews before I ordered this shuffler,"I just purchased a Bicycle 1-2 Deck Shuffler from Amazon. It is my first automatic shuffler, and I was trusting that since it was sold as a Bicycle shuffler, they would have the operation mastered. Unfortunately, almost all of the problems had already been listed by former reviewers, and I did not read them all. Oh, well!The shuffler is noisy. The cards hang up inside the shuffler as the tray is removed.The right hand side of the shuffler does not feed all of the cards into the chamber, and the last cards need to be hand fed.Most discouraging, I sorted by suit, and found, as I suspected, the cards are not being well shuffled. I am a senior citizen with rather severe arthritis, and had hoped that this product would be helpful.Amazon made it very easy to buy; I hope it will be equally easy to return. My advice is: Don't waste your money."
5,Easy and Quick,I'm a member of a card club and since I bought the card shuffler it has made the games go a little faster. I bought the 1-2 card shuffler because it is smaller to take on a vacation.Love my shuffler.
2,"Works, but noisy","This machine had mixed reviews from two poker clubs. One group disliked it because it's noisy, while the other was 50/50. I decided to return it, but was pay the return date. I may donate it."
4,Shuffle it,We play a lot of card games with multiple decks and it was tiring shuffling by hand. The new shuffler saves a lot of time although it is a bit noisy.
1,Bicycle Card Shcuffler,Bicycle Card Schuffler did not schuffle cards evenly from the start. After a very few uses it stopped working all together. Would not advise to puchase this product.
1,deckcard shuffler,"not worth the money that was spent!!!I wish they would refund my money!!!thanks,nancy"
3,Card Shuffer - Didn't work upon arrival,"Bought two of these card shufflers in October for Christmas gifts for out of towners. One of them works fine, the other doesn't work - it only shoots one deck of cards through, basically just restacking the one deck (no shuffling). By the time the recipient opened the gift and discovered that it didn't work, it was too late to return.Bicycle Automatic Card Shuffler"
2,helmet speakers,It fit my helmet like I wanted.But the volume sucks.I turned the volume wide open with out being in my helmet and could barely hear it.I put them in my helmet starter my bike and could not hear at all with volume as loud as it would go.I guess this is what I get for going cheep.
5,Great in-helmet radar alert!!!!,I have been looking for a viable solution for having a comfortable in-helmet speaker that Ican use with my radar detector on my motorcycle.I experimented with various ear butts that only caused discomfort especiallywhile planting/removing the helmet.I'm very happy with this system since it has a volume control and disconnect anddoes not put undue pressure on my ears.
3,Helmet speakers purchased on Amazon,I purchased the helmet speakers to use while riding my 34 year ould BMW airhead. The bike is quiet and has a fairing. I like the helmet speakers and especially the detachment from the volume control. The problem I have is there is not enough VOLUME to control. Perhaps the problem is not in the helmet speakers but my Zune doesnt have enough wattage to appreciativly run the speakers. I can only hear the unit while stopped. The helmet speakers are a great idea. I will continue to run the unit and will look for an amp or something to raise the volume. Otherwise- recommend this product!Thanks
1,Don't Bother!!,I thought that I would be able to ride on the highway while listening to some tunes from the IPOD. That is NOT happening with these. You are better offer using regular ipod headphones or investing in a bluetooth helmet like i did. waste of money. Volume is too low...cant hear even when the bike is OFF!!
4,Good product BUT Dont stop here Needs Power Boost!!!,I advise anyone who buys this to add an inline amp system with order.The more power the better. If you don.t you will be disapointed.
4,works great,they fit nicely in my helmet. They aren't very loud but you can get a booster/splitter and you and tour passenger can enjoy the music.
1,not what I expected,I can't say anything about the performance of this product because I never installed it in my helmet. I didn't care for the look of the speakers so I didn't bother to install them.
3,The music is like a background sound only.,"It is ver good built, easy to install, great looks.But it's not loud. It is good because you hear the exterior, and you hear the music as a backgroud (great for security reasons)."
1,Bad Choice- Even on a Scooter,"I tried these with my MP3 player all the way up with a Boostaroo headphone amplifier and the volume on the speakers all the way up inside a closed full face HJC helmet- still couldn't hear much of anything. I was sitting still on my 500cc Aprilia Scooter- probably the quietest ""motorcycle"" out there. I'm far from deaf and my $10 Sony over the ear sporty buds are pristine under the same conditions- save your time and money and head to Walmart. I'm mailing them back tomorrow. (the Boostaroo does help with regular earphones/buds to get over the bike and wind noise.)"
2,Not Loud Enough,"I agree with many of the other reviewers. Definitly NOT loud enough, I tried them with my Ipod and my Garmin - neither was loud enough. I had to go with in ear phones."
1,Missouri Breaks,It was not properly formatted for our area / zone. We had to watch it on our computer the DVD player wouldn't play the disk.
1,Not Eliot's Poetry,"A number of the poems in this book are not Eliot's. For instance, Robert Browning wrote ""How they Brought the Good News From Ghent To Aix,"" and EBB wrote ""Mother and Poet."" For an authoritative collection of her poetry, get Skoob Books' George Eliot: Collected Poems, ed. Lucien Jenkins, 1989."
2,Missing A Lot Of Eliot's Work...,"This collection is missing a substantial amount of work by George Eliot and is nowhere near complete. There are several key missing items including her ENTIRE essay's collection! I wish the publishers of these collections would do their research before just slapping up a fancy eBook graphic and calling their submissions ""complete."" You will have to purchase additional items to complete this ""complete"" collection I'm afraid.Update: After my leaving an honest 2 star review, the seller personally attacked me saying I threatened to leave negative feedback if I didn't get a free copy of this $2 product. This seller, Peter Russell of Delphi Classics, is unbalanced and delusional, I'm a minister for pete's sake!Chris Elliott"
1,A Very Poor Effort,"I have read many of the 40K novels. I have enjoyed many of them. This was not one of them. Some authors can write books that transcend the fact that they are the intellectual properties of someone else. They can make them their own and transcend the genre. This author is not one of them. Much of the dialouge and details seems very forced and inconsistent. If you play the game that this novel is based on, you get the feeling you are reading bad fluff. Everything reads as if the author is reading directly out of a codex and forces it. A bad book, badly written."
5,Bloody Brilliant!,"Many of the Space Marine books are very similar and it takes a lot to make them stand out. I wasn't sure if novels about the Blood Angels would work with the sort of story that was being offered (the return of Sanguinius), but this blew me away! Bloodsoaked battle scenes and good characters and good use of the BAs chapter background all the way through. There is a cliffhanger ending but it left me breathless!"
4,"Excellent book, but no charts...",Nice read and good tips as well. But a few charts. A good begining. I'm satisfied with the book. I Recommend.
2,Weak book attempt,"When I read this book it reminded me of a seminar that Tom did in Las Vegas. He is full of himself and it is not a secret that he makes money selling books and training, not trading. If you want to learn how to trade read up on Rob Wallaston,Toby Crabel, Linda Rascke, find it used on Ebay or whatever, just read up on the real traders, not on the entertainers."
1,Save Your Money!,"The book has a catchy title but do NOT expect to find anything of value inside. Just the usual comments like ""always use a stop"", ""don't overtrade"", ""use a sound money management"", ""stay disciplined"" and blah blah blah...This book is a total joke, save your money and run !"
4,"WORTH READING BUT DON'T STOP THERE, NOT VERY TECHNICAL, MORE ABOUT THE AUTHOR'S REAL LIFE STORY","I read this among a few other books, well worth reading.here are the pros and cons.Pros:- written based on a real life story- Reader friendly and you'll definetly understand itCons:- lays down a few techniques but don't expect much- not so much about technical analysis, charting or indicators- author tends to be brief sometimes and limited info is givenIf you are new to trading, read it and do so only if you will read a few other books on technical analysis and charting as well as fundamentals.A bit expensive for its listed price of $60 but you can get at amazon for much less, especially since it's a small book.remeber there is a lot to this game ""trading"" so educate yourself before you put your $$$ on the line and remember"" The trend is your friend except at the end""good luck and happy trading."
4,Its all About the Stock Rally,"I think this book is good enough but one needs more updated strategies to make in this gameThese days it's really hard to find trading books that are practical and simple to understand. Most of the info outhere is full of the same thecnical analysis jargon that makes you lose a lot of times. Basically most tehcnical trading books tell you the same story but organized in different chapters using different words and charts as examples.Some places on the web have pretty practical information. One site that I recommend is StressFreeTraders com. They have a pretty clear way for trading stocks with momentum using easy to understand strategies. This is also one place where you can understand why the use of a Level 2 system is critical for trading the rally.Understanding how to trade a rally is one of the most important aspects of trading, since for us traders the rally is where we make our money."
2,Indicators should not be propriatary in text books,"While there is a great deal of interesting and useful information in this book, I strongly resent the author's presentation of two important indicators i.e. the V-Factor and TTICK without providing us the means (program information) to use these indicators. The presentation of results without informing the reader with the methods to obtain those results is unheard of in other fields of endeavor such as scientific research. First class operations and authors do not operate in this fashion."
4,"Good Book, but not 5 star","I enjoyed the book and learned alot, especially about getting ready for the start of the market day. It is also good for monitoring your trade during the day. The only complaints are regarding using key numbers in the indexes and his indicators. It mentions them, but I wish he would have given them for all indexes he talks about. Also, some of the indicators he uses can only be obtained if you buy his system. He also sort of pushes his classes, but this may be good to learn the art of trading. So all in all, the book is very good, but I just wish the detail was more intense. Also, the book is fun to read as he gives examples of real life experiences. He also thinks the world of Jesse Livermore, which I agree was the greatest trader."
1,SCAM: There is NO Geology CLEP TEST!!!!,"This company sells hundreds of these CLEP prep guides. I bought this one because I'm under great pressure to get credits out of the way. I spent weeks reading and memorizing from this book to prepare for the Geology clep exam and eventually caught wind of the fact that very little of the content is in the sample tests and very little of the sample tests contain questions for which the book prepares the reader. I called the College Board to ask if they sell or recommend anything better, where I was informed that THERE IS NO GEOLOGY CLEP TEST!!!f I have money I;d take these people to court. I want my wasted time back!!"
2,Someone tell me how to get the mold to release,"I even wrote to the company. They said slather it in butter. I thought the point of silicone molds was simple release. Not so with this one. If I have a chocolate Bavarian, do I really want to slather it in butter? Cute design, maybe I'll hang it on the wall."
4,Great buy,It was great to get this book in such good condition for such a great price. Was in great condition. Very satisfactory.
4,Carpathian Series,"Again, I got this book since I am reading the series and would recommend it to anyone interested in Vampire books. It is certainly a different take on them."
5,"Again, Excellent",I think her books are all well written. They allow you to feel what's going on and with her wording you can actually see in your mind what the surroundings are like.
2,Much too repetitive,"My only gripe about this novel is that it is much too repetitive. I swear phrases and sentences are used 4 or 5 times too much. I don't understand why Feehan does this - maybe to add more pages.Other than that, the idea is good, I thought the characters were fine, and the writing is fine in some instances as well. If Feehan could just stop hammering the same thing over and over again it the novel would be better."
3,Not as Good as Dark Prince (Book 1),"I accidentally started out with Dark Fire (Book 6 of the Dark series), and I loved that book so much that I went on to purchase Dark Prince, Dark Desire, and Dark Gold. Dark Fire and Dark Prince inspired me to keep reading this series, but I was a little disappointed with Dark Desire. The story line is a little blah, and the characters were just a little too predictable. Christine Feehan is still a great writer, and Dark Desire is not worth giving up on the rest of the series, but I will honestly say that I was a little disappointed with it, and I'm glad I was able to read through it as quickly as I did so that I could continue with the next book, which is definitely better."
2,too much abuse,"I disliked the violence Jacques occasionally displayed towards Shea, with his 'insanity' serving as an excuse. Particularly in the scenes at the beginning of the book, such as where Jacques meets his brother again, the abuse was too much to ever allow Jacques to be a likeable, or even tolerable, character. This was my least favourite of all her Dark series books."
5,Another smash hit in Feehan's Dark Series!,"I love every book in this series but this book especially pulls at your heart strings. What happens to poor Jacques is horrible. Even though Shea doesn't understand it all at first; she is still so brave and compassionate and strong of character she pulls Jacques out of the hell his mind has sunk into. She does everything she can to help him and in return he gives over his whole body and soul into her keeping. I love that each book in the Dark series is so unique to each couple and it never gets tired or trite with each new book. I strongly recommend anything she writes, you can't go wrong."
4,Want to Read More,Very good book. Nice sequel. Would liked to have learned more about Rand and his relationship to Maggie and Shea. Hope to read much more about Gregori! I highly recommend this book.
3,Not one of the best books I've read !,The sex scenes went on and on and on ! To explict each time !Christine writes better than this.
4,2nd Book in a great series of stories,"""Dark Desire"" is the 2nd book is a series of stories about the Carpathians. Not evil, but immortal and blooding drinkers, these compelling beings are under attack by true vampires and humans that hunt vampires. Jacques, a Carpathian who is younger brother to the Prince, has been taken captive and torchured by evil men and left in a basement in an abandoned building to suffer for years. He is able to overcome his pain and communicate with a woman who will become his lifemate. This story is interesting and unusually different than the others in the series. I have tried to read the series in order since characters are innerwoven throughout others' storylines. Dark Desire explains a lot about the history of Carpathians, and the physical and metaphysical differences between humans and immortals. Author, Christine Feehan, has a great immagination and writes well."
4,Dark Desire,"For all of us who miss the Buffy the Vampire Series and believe that there ARE other species of goodness out there this is the series to read. I enjoyed the storyline, the passionate love and connection between the couple and hope that others discover this series."
4,"good, but...","Now don't get me wrong, I enjoyed this book, but in the face of the overwhelming number of five-star reviews, I felt a little weird. I read Dark Prince, loved it, went out and bought this book the next day.This book, while still good, didn't have quite the same chemistry between the two main characters. Jacques' character never seemed really fleshed out to me. He has two elements to his personality--protectiveness, primarily towards the heroine, and a desire for vengeance.While trying to avoid giving too much away, I didn't completely understand the connection between the villains in this book and the previous one, although the author attempts to explain it.Still, I enjoyed this book, although it was a slight disappointment after Dark Prince."
3,Beware of overbearing males...,"It is a good book. It follows the series well, the plot stays with the ones that come before it.The sex scenes are too drawn out, the story line is good though. I have become accustom to skipping the 3-4 page long sex and then starting to read again.I'll continure to buy the dark series, just because I like the stories."
4,taste the danger,"Jacques will keep on your toes. Just the thought that he just might turn and finish with his lifemate Shea life, kept me reading until I was done. Hope you will enjoy the book as much as I did."
5,Awsome,"This is one of Christeen's best yet. I love the whole vampire genre and christeen's charcters are so sensual and sexy it is difficult to put the book down. I have spent so much on books since I began to read her novels, as I can't get enough of the fantasy she creates in each of her novels. This book I read twice because it is so beautifully written and engrossing."
5,WOW!!!,This was my first Feehan and book and I was so enthralled that I read it in one day then I re-read again. I am really looking forward to the others in the series. If you like Dara Joy or Linda Lael Miller's Vampire romances this book is for you.
5,Chrisitne Feehan deserves no less than 5 stars!!,"Jacques, the younger brother of Mikhail is chained and tortured. He reaches out and connects with Shea from america. Shea happens to be a DR. (half carpathian half human) though jacques forms a link in her mind calling for help, his mind is so tortured he believes she is the enemy. Shea sets out for her homeland and discovers jacques. Though he tries at first to harm her she still decides he needs her care to get better. But once Jacques realizes she is his lifemate he will not allow her to get away from him ever. In this story Mikhail and Raven as well as Grigori show up which brings you linked to Christines past books. This story was extremely hard to put down and I found I read it well into the night. You should not skip this book!!"
4,"This is my favorite Carpathian book, so far!","I just loved Jacques' and Shea's story. My heart ached for Jacques and when Shea found him and he realized she was his lifemate, I just melted! What a marvelous story!"
4,Dark Desire,I am just enjoying this series. I still have a long way to go before catching up to the new one but I am not in a rush.
4,Carpathian calling,this second in her series is MUCH better than the original. I am glad Jacques keep after Ms Feehan's mind to tell his story properly. We get both male and female heros and such love and understanding we all wish for. Looking forward to the remaining set of Carpathian novels.
4,another dark carpathian,Another enjoyable read from Christine Feehan. I have enjoyed the entire series and await more to come.
3,great run-about shoe,"Athough it's not a running shoe per se, (it's too heavy) It is a great looking and comfortable shoe for every day wear."
2,majority of the book is missing,"This does contain 116 pages as advertised. However, the original book hasover 500 pages, so it's pretty frustrating to just read a page or two hereand there. This fact should be explained up front, so I wouldn't have wastedmy money and time on it. I gave it two stars because maybe scholars can still get something from it, assuming this kind of information is near impossible to get.I want something more complete!!"
5,Cheaper than the box DIY stores!,You'll pay less for this air hose and get 2X more than Lowes or home depot. It's worth it. Definitely a sure-order!
5,Good Hose - Good Price,"This hose is just about as good as my old blue Flexeel 100' hose that had been repaired too many times. It is supple and doesn't really have any memory. It rolls out fine and lays flatThe free fittings are an added bonus. The fittings are Type-M 1/4"". The black strain-relief ends are fine and haven't failed. I'm glad that I bought this hose."
4,air hose,I have not used this particular hose as yet. I have used other Hitachi hoses and felt they performed very well. Hose is light weight and I like the connectors installed when the hose is purchased.
4,Hitachi air hose,"This air hose is definitely better than rubber types I have been using. Disappointed that the fitting on the female end was loose and had to be tightened to stop leak. Impossible to have come loose in shipping, so poor quality control by Hitachi?? Would definitely buy another one when the need arises, just will tighten all fittings before using."
5,"Durable, Light just what I needed! Best Air Hose in the Market period.","I been using the Hitachi for a little over 8 months now. I don't have a reel for it so its been stepped on, stuff falls on it and moves around but it is still working! Very durable and amazingly light. This is a 100 foot hose and it should be a lot heavier than it is but it is light so I can actually take it with me if I needed to. Definitely a recommended buy!"
2,"Hitachi 100'x1/4"" air hose","I think this is an okay hose, all 100' hoses are not tangle free and this one is no exception, my beef is that the black end/bend protectors have already come away from the area they are supposed to protect after one week of use (bummer), my American hoses are still intact after five years of constant use, this is a relatively cheap/disposable import from China."
4,So Funky. F-U-N-K-A-Y!,"I had this on tape and wore it out. My fave album from the Wases, and a funky, smooth, danceable blast from beginning to end. It's challenging, if you listen closely, and you will. But you can just enjoy the groove too without getting too caught up as well. Great guest vocals. Well worth the $9."
1,Unwatchable!!,"Hard to believe this was ever greenlit! Horrid story, bad acting and laughably bad sfx. Kinda good for a laugh though. Not quite ""so bad it's good"" like ""Plan 9 From Outer Space"", but just plain bad."
1,"Mistake On My Part, And The Director's","It's long after Kong fell off the Empire State Building, and all this time scientists tried to save Kong with an arteficial heart. Meanwhile the army finds out about Lady Kong and try to kill both of them. This plot is good but they make the movie seem so boring you want to run away. I was going to get Rodan when I was younger but my mom showed me this and I chose it. Turns out Rodan was 17,000,000,000 times better than this pathetic film. If you want to die of boredom, watch this terrible excuse for a King Kong movie."
1,Deserved two stars less than what I gave it.,"Well, my brother is a fan of the big ape so he rented this flick and made me sit through it. It was downright awful. The special effects were prehistoric. My brother was in tears because it was so bad. It seemed like it was written by a bunch of kids. What's worse, the director tried to make it seemed serious by throwing in a bedroom scene, swears, and gore. All this did was make the movie even worse. The only cool scene was when Kong got a heart transplant. They pulled out his heart, which was about the size of a Ford truck, and it was still beating. Cooooooool!!!! If you love King Kong like I do, please don't watch this movie! It will make you embarrassed to be a Kong fan!"
2,The Title Should Be: KING CAMP LIVES,"Watching this film some 18 years later I wondered what were the filmmakers thinking? Was this to be taken serious? Gee, I hope not, but like a bad traffic accident or ""Grease 2"" you just can't help but watch it. I am a big supporter of giant monster movies. Yes, even bad ones. The special effects aren't that special; the acting is wooden and almost non-existant. But it is fun, campy and has a great deal of action."
2,A Comedy of Tragedy,"Serious Comedy:-)Keep that in mind before sitting down to enjoy, one of the most unbelievable movies of all time. Suspends all belief, while at the same time tickling your funny bone. The transplant surgery is cinematic gold. You'll never see anything like it again ... thank God.And then, we get Monkey Love! Kong and Lady get down and dirty, resulting in baby Kong. Bloody death scene for Kong at the end by way of tanks, making it the most heavy scene of the film.Other than that, there's nothing more to report. Basically, if Kong farted this movie would be the result . . . popcorn anyone:-)"
4,King Kong. The sequel.,"Pointless sequel, they should have left poor King Kong dead. Linda Hamilton (along with a bunch of other doctors) brings ol' King Kong back to life, but this time... somewhere in some jungle, they find Lady Kong, whom they drag to the US... then a strange romance unveils between both Kongs... and on and on.I'm not surprised why they didn't do a follow up to this one.Above average special effects, a haunting musical score."
1,Makes The 1976 Film Look Like Oscar Material,"If there is anyone out there who wants to see two huge gorillas camp it up while the army runs around like a chicken with its head cut off, this movie is so dumb it should win a Gall Award just for being released on the public.Guess what?No Kong didn't croak after the Twin Towers episode, they have giving him a new heart, they have the technology, they can make him better, faster, smarter, no kids it's not the 6 million dollar ape although that idea could have only been an improvement to what's on offer here."
2,How this film was pitched,"True story: this guy goes into Dino's office to pitch a few ideas for films. Dino seems completely unimpressed by them. As a last ditch effort for a sale he proposes a sequel to King Kong.""But the monkey died at the end of the film. How can you make a sequel?"" Dino asks.""They give Kong an artificial heart!""Dino's eyes light up and he makes a deal for the screenwriter to write it. The screenwriter goes home happy that he made a sale and clueless what to do for a story. And it shows."
1,This film should be put out of its misery!,"Once one has scraped the bottom of the proverbial barrell, if he or she were to lift up that barrell and dig for about 2 hour they would find this film. Fair to bad spfx highlight this lame tale of King Kong falling in love with a lady gorilla and being pursued by the military, scientists, etc., etc., ad infinitum. Do I really need to go on? This film is really bad, populated with goofy characters and enough cliches to sink a large aircraft carrier. Hopeless in the extreme, more witless than a clump of dirt, KKL is absolutely lethal!"
1,Kong is alive and finds a girlfriend.,"This film is a direct sequel to the 1976 version ofKing Kongand you are treated to a quick 2 minutes of the condensed ending of that film starring Jeff Bridges and Jessica Lange.It is now 10 years later. In Atlanta, they have the body of King Kong whoose heart was restored. With the help of Amy (Linda Hamilton) they have tried to fully revive Kong with a 7 million dollar artificial heart at the Institute. However, Kong's blood is weak. He needs a transfusion.Meanwhile, Hank Mitchell (Brian Kerwin) is in the Amazon and just so happens to discover a Lady Kong that they quickly capture.A miracle for King Kong at last. They bring Lady Kong to Atlanta and King Kong goes berserk. Only one mile apart he can smell her.The Chinese are going to love this one!Shown in Widescreen.New Movie: Peter Jackson's KING KONG (2005).King Kong [Blu-ray]."
1,MAKES THE 1976 FILM LOOK LIKE CASABLANCA,This is a bottom of the barrel film in every way. You can be sure they showed no clippings of this when Dino de Larentiis was granted a lifetime achievement Oscar.You'll need a shrink after seeing Lady Kong (a guy in a gorilla suit) make eyes at Kong (yet another guy in a gorilla suit).Just horrible !
2,What did they expect from this movie?,"""King Kong Lives"" is just a low budget wannabe Kong film ( it's just like this japanese movie from 1967 simply called ""A.P.E"" ). The acting is terrible, the effects are worse ( Godzilla would laugh at these effects ) and the stupid love story they try to toss in is an expected turn for this awful movie. Theres nudity in the film, hey this is a King Kong movie, not some kind of porno film. The worst part about this film is that they find another 50ft. ape girlfreind for Kong. Thats about the stupidest idea in the history of film. I wonder what the makers of this film thought they would get from this horrible movie. Was it made for laughs or was it an unsucessful attempt to make yet another sequal to the 1933 masterpiece? So, unless your collecting all the King Kong movies ( like me ), dont even rent this movie for $ .99 ( unless you like to watch movies that are even worse than ""Godzilla vs. Megalon"" )"
1,"This is not a movie, I don't know what it is.....","First off, I am not a fan of the awful 1976 remake. I only can say that it was a miricle that it did not destroy the careers of Jessica Lange and Jeff Bridges. Fast forward to 1986, and we are treated to another outing with Kong, this time having been in a coma for ten years (somehow we are supposed to belive that he survived being shot by machine guns and then falling over a thousand feet.) and we have poor Linda Hamilton trying to save the Big K with a new giant heart (how they got funding for all this we never know) and we also have a large female Kong who, when Kong is revived falls in love with and they run away to the mountains where the Army follows them, and well after that I lost interest. Thankfully I never saw this at the movies or on DVD, but on one of those late movies on television. Anyway Linda;s film career thankfully was not destroyed by this movie although it took some years before she was offered serious roles again."
5,King Kong Lives,I like the movie. It is funny and very entertaining. There are plenty of mistakes to point out about this movie that are unrealistic but that is part of what makes it so entertaining.
2,Thyroid Making You Fat book,"I just got this book out of storage to re-read and I realize it's wasted money. I am already on natural thyroid replacement and with that I have lost a lot of weight but to follow a 1000 calorie a day diet (in one place he says 800 per day) is impossible for me. My doctor wants me getting highly nutritous foods and there is no way on this amount. Plus, how many of us are willing to do this for not 1 week, not 2, but for 4 weeks! AND when I was doing aerobics religiously and following 1000 cal per day, I didn't lose weight but this is what he recommends. Never again.I gave it 2 stars because it did convince me, a couple of years ago, to find a doctor who uses natural thyroid instead of just synthetics. If the synthetics work for you, hooray but they didn't for me."
1,Not worth the money - useless!,"This book was very confusing and made absolutely no sense. I have a medical background and understand medical terminology, anatomy and physiology, but this book was a total waste!"
1,If you know you have Hypothyroidism - This will not help!,"I am looking for a nutritional guide to help me determine how to eat now that I have been diagnosed with Hypothyroidism. This is not it. I am an extremely active female and am gaining weight. I was hoping this might give me some insight but it seems to be geared more for finding the problem, not living with it. The basic information given was not something that I had not already read."
1,If you have a thyroid problem this book won't help!,I read this book & was very disappointed. It has some basic things that anyone with a thyroid problem already knows. As far as the diagnosis method it is to eat a 1000 calorie diet for 28 days to see if you loose weight normally. And the diet to lose weight is to eat 1000 calories a day. Very unhealthy & unrealistic.
5,I admire a man who tells it like it is!,"Three cheers for the good Dr. Siegal! He provides a way for any person to help themselves before or after being diagnosed with hypothyroidism. It was hard to put the book down once I started reading it. He is very opinionated on using natural thyroid for treatment and it is hard to dispute his findings.He even wrote a chapter for your doctor to read and makes those with the disease wish there was a Dr. Siegal practicing medicine within a reasonable driving distance from their home. If you live in South Florida, you're lucky - you have him. Excellent book that anyone can understand."
1,No help,"I didn't find this book of any help. I was also already diagnosed but hoped to find a way to lose weight after 15 years of gradual increase in weight due to an underactive thyroid (hashimoto's thyroiditis). I couldn't possibly stick to this diet and decided that it wasn't worth trying anyway, just to find out what I know already. I had hoped it would teach me a way to eat that would help me lose weight, but it does not. It might just be of use to people who haven't yet been diagnosed, but I doubt it, because if the doctor hasn't diagnosed you yet, he is not going to do so on the basis of a book."
4,Overall a good product.,"Quickly calculates routes (Sometimes does not display hourglass on longer routes so it looks like it is locked up, be patient).Very clear screen, automatically adjusts brightness and even automatically changes to a night color pallet.Touch screen pretty good. My wife has better response with her finger nail than I have with my finger, but I have no problems with the major functions and only minor problems with some of the less used functions.Comes with a bulky, but very solid windshield mount.Only 2 real complaints, 1) When playing a CD, control of the CD functions are limited, I still use the car CD. 2) Volume control is a little awkward."
1,Don't Buy This,"I purchased this product online from NewEgg (who, by the way aren't so great to deal with either) in April. By May, I got the ""Flash"" error. Sent the product to Initial mid May and got it back end of July. They claim to never have receive my invoice that i faxed, so the GPS/DVD sat there for almost 2 months. So it's now it's Aug 7 and my GPS/DVD failed AGAIN with the ""Flash"" message. I am sending this back again and they offered to replace it with the GM-701. From the other feedback I've seen, I'm not sure this is going to be any different result. Takes forever to get to talk to someone at Initial and no matter what their messages say, they will NOT call you back if you leave a VM or email."
1,DO NOT BUY THIS ITEM: You will get lost with this unit.,"I purchased this unit two weeks ago and I have tried many different ways to get this voice prompted directions correctly. But almost everytime, the voice directions are not consistent, and many times the directions are too slow. It tells me to turn after I passed a street. When I tried to follow the directions, and 50% of the time I get lost because the directions are too slow.I called the tech support and they keep telling me that the unit seems working, of course it is working. It is just too slow to use on the local streets.DO NOT BUY THIS UNIT. YOU WILL REGRET LIKE MYSELF. SPEND YOUR MONEY FOR A BETTER NAME BRAND. In case you want to hear my testimony, let me know at ""cyoon77@yahoo.com"""
1,GD-70x,"I purchased GD-70X on-line. Unfortunately it broke during 2/3 months. It was returned and later the same item was sent back to me. I only used it 3x because I took extra-care in it,but, same problem occured. This time I choose another item to replace it with GM-701. Unfortunately, I tested GM-701 for 5 days but it hang-up and I keep re-setting the destination to make it works. This time, I chose my GD-70X hoping to make it works. INITIAL (Co)will replace it with my original GD-70X but advised me that next time if any problem occurs. I'll have to pay for labor or if I want to extend my warranty, I'll have to pay additional amount for extended warranty.TO PROSPECTIVE BUYER: Be causious in buying GPS, look for a good quality. Give consideration on reading reviews of the item."
2,"after a year, kaput gps","my gps unit worked for about a year. After shelved it for 2 months, the gps software wont load anymore. It gave the error ""intellinav.exe is not a window ce application"". The DVD player still works though. Tech support as usual, non-existent. Does anyone know how to reset this thing?I have disconnected the battery and the same problem persists."
1,FOR GOD'S SAKE DO NOT BUY THIS PRODUCT,I purchased this product for the dual use. The DVD on this unit never worked and when i called the customer service they wanted me to send it back to them and were going to charge me $160 to replace it with the newer version. I asked what would they do if the DVD does not function in the new unit and they did not had an answer to that. This company does not stand by its product. DO NOT MAKE A MISTAKE OF BUYING THIS PRODUCT AT ANY COST!
3,A Nice Quick Gift,This made a very nice gift for Grandma. It's very cute when finished. It's also a very simple design with very few half-stitches. Great for beginners.
2,Can't recommend,"I've tried this product to compare it with another Silicone bakeware product from Demarle. It's not even close to their product line. Using a simple yellow cake mix, I tried baking with out using butter or nonstick spray. It baked ok, but the cake did not come out of the mold without parts of the cake sticking to the mold."
4,A witchy adventure!,"I read this book back when I was back in early grade school and I thought it had a very original storyline. It is not a scary book, but has more of an updated, Nancy Drew Witchy-feeling adventure kind of theme to it. I definitely recommend it for the kids!"
5,The Witches Buttons,The content keeps ou very entertained and guessing what wil happen next. It is a great speell binding novel that is an easy reader for any age.
2,"READ FEARLESS GIRLS, WISE WOMEN AND BELOVED SISTERS INSTEAD","This book was terrible. The women in it are not anymore powerful than in traditional fairy tales (and they are involved with both attempted rape and domestic violence because they pick the wrong guys--they are sooo powerful because they kick men in the crotch to escape!). Plus, it seems that it is ok to say that men who are ugly are not as good as men who are attractive--basically she is advocating being a sexist as long as it is not against women. She also seems to have missed the fact that lots of ""negative"" aspects of traditional fairy tales (esp wolves) serve an allegorical purpose and taking them all so literally only makes her new stories very dull and wooden as she tries so hard to correct thses ""mistakes"". Please, please read Fearless Girls, Wise Women, and Beloved Sisters by Kathleen Ragan instead--far and above the best book with strong female heroines in a fairy tale/folktale setting!!"
3,A Mixed Bag,"Barbara Walker's ""Feminist Fairy Tales"" is definitely worth reading. The art by Laurie Harden is lovely, and some of the stories are marvelous, in a variety of ways. ""The Three Little Pinks"" is cute, ""The Descent of Shaloma"" is mysterious and romantic, and ""Ugly and the Beast"" is a touching retelling of the old story that Disney mutilated and crammmed down our throats. However, several of the stories really drag, and some of the others are thin veils for Walker's ""Female Power GOOD! Patriarchal Oppression BAD!"" message. Still, with all its flaws, it's a good book that makes many good points, and a nice change from the ""Beautiful submissive women are the only worthwhile ones"" message many other fairy tales have. I only wish Walker had focused more on the stories and less on the morals."
5,Feminist Fairy Tales,It is nice book and we have it in Korea too.It's fairThank youThis review was written by an 8th grade Korean female student. She told me about this book and found it very interesting from a girls point of view.
3,It gets repetitive.,"I had a hard time finishing this book. It has one good point: suburbs, by design, destroy the cohesion of communities. The author repeats this point (in my opinion) ad naseum throughout the book. He also idealizes community meeting places (the tavern, the drug store, main street) from the past. Nonetheless, I still think that we should all read this book. It gives at least a few hints about why we never see some of the people who live only two doors down form us. His solutions also might help us break down the isolation and anonymity of the 'burbs."
2,Absurdity,"This is undoubtedly one of the silliest (unintentionally) moviesI have ever seen. Basically an excuse to see Paderewski inaction, but unfortunately accompanied by random acts of plot.For some reason, never made clear, most of the action is set inSweden, which looks like a stage and a canvas backdrop. A veryyoung Eric Portman plays a Portuguese!? All players haveterribly English accents, and make no attempt to disguise them.All of this looks even weirder than it sounds, and the music isn't even that great. Good for a laugh, though."
4,Very Entertaining,"Buy this. It's cheap and of rather high quality as far as classical music recordings go. The selection is actually very good, including excellent songs like Peter and the Wolf, Polovtsian Dances, Circus Polka, Saber Dance and so on. Overall I'd give it 4.5/5."
3,Fairly good Russian romantic music intro...,"For a couple of bucks or less you can own this digital CD compilation featuring some basic and not so basic Russian tidbits. Servicable if not distinguished performances of ""A Night On The Bare Mountain"" and ""The Polovtsian Dances"" are the anchors. You also get the must have ""Sabre Dance"" and the balance of the program is made up of short pieces that blend well. Notables are the two rare Glinka excerpts as well as Tchaikovsky's joyous Waltz from ""Eugene Onegin"". The kids will get a kick out of the lighter side of Stravinsky, with his ""Circus Polka for a Young Elephant"". The excerpt from ""Peter and the Wolf"" will inspire those to pick up a complete version. The wonderful sound and inventive orchestrations from these essential composers will make even the most remote listener of the classics sit up and take notice."
1,"crappy,leaky mug",This is crap! It leaks. The black inside part comes right out. I will never buy another mug like this again.
3,Not worth it.,"A disappointment. Sure it gives you the basics as each year of these do. However, the best gas mileage isn't compared between cars anymore. That's the main reason I purchased this book. It was getting to be a headache trying to compare online & I thought this book would help.....guess I was wrong!"
1,good price-bad quality,"four days after i bought this set, there were little rust spots on the whole set, mostly the knives though. i even called the company to complain, and never got a response. very frustrating!"
1,Beware Sharp Edges!!,"I was very excited to receive this flatware because I really liked the design of it. Unfortunately my excitement didn't last long because the first time I ate with one of the spoons its sharp edge cut the inside of my mouth! No exaggeration, it literally created a thin, half inch slice on the inside of my cheek near the corner of my mouth. Upon inspection of the other spoons in the package, they each seemed to have at least one potentially dangerous rough/sharp spot as well. So disappointing! These are definitely going back."
3,Does the job,"For the price, these aren't all that I was hoping them to be. They are good, don't get me wrong, but they aren't fabulous. I was hoping for a bit more weighty, and they don't have that feel. Good, but if you are looking for high quality, this isn't the steal I was hoping it was."
1,Dissappointing,"They started rusting with the very first wash right out of the box. It's rather dumb when you read the guide on the Do's and Don'ts for care for this silverware and it says ""Do polish away any stains with a stainless steel polish."" Does anyone else besides me I have a problem with that sentence?!? If it's stainless steel it shouldn't get stains or rust to begin with!This item was a wedding present, it was washed in a brand new state-of-the art dishwasher.I've learned my lesson: I will avoid GS products like the plague."
4,Pleased!,I have been looking high and low for a new flatware set and the minute I seen &quot;Non Stop&quot; I had to have it! Needless to say...I am very pleased!
3,Love the style and the heft -- but not the rust!,"These are beautiful pieces that have a wonderful weight and good balance. We bought 4 sets and look forward to the serving pieces. Unfortunately, many of our knives have started to show rust marks after only a few months of being run through the dishwasher. Perhaps they need special treatment (i.e., handwashing) but there was no warning of this on the package -- so consider this a warning if you are planning to buy this set!"
2,They looked great until the rust spots...,"The fun, trendy appearance of the set sold me the moment I saw them! However, once I got the flatware home and found the set advertised as 18/10 stamped with 18/8, I became weary. I called the manufacturer, and they explained that some of the first sets sent out to Target were accidentally stamped incorrectly. I was fine with that since they assured me the flatware was made of quality materials. However, after only 2 weeks of using and washing the flatware exactly as instructed on the package, I started to notice small rust spots on all the different pieces.I am very dissapointed."
3,not as it used to be..,"I bought this product for my wedding 10 years ago. When I was looking for another set I was really excited to find out that they still had the same flatware! When they came in the mail we compared them to our original set. They were the same shape and sheen but lighter in the weight. I am happy that my flatware all matches but I am not excited about how the new set feels lighter, a little skimpier in quality, even though it's supposed to be the same product."
3,SKB Bow ECO Case,"I looked at several bow cases before selecting this particular case. However, ECONOMY really fits this case. The case has ZERO padding and has a ECONOMICAL method for tie downs. It appears to me that SKB spent more time designing the shell than the interior of this case. The SKB Economy Parallel Limb Bow Case is very heavy and built to last, but it's not what every hunter wants to carry. With the lack of padding on the interior compartment, I'm not sure I would use it for air travel. My recommendation is to invest in the more expensive SKB case with more padding."
4,Solid Early 50's Railroad Western,"Edmond O'Brien was always good. At his worst he was good, at his best he was great. In Denver & Rio Grande he's somewhere in the middle. The movie, directed by Byron Haskin, is always entertaining, and always holds your attention. It's got a fair amount of action, and that's well played. It also has a solid plot and some good characters. The cast is good from top to bottom, and the location footage is really nice.Olive Films' Blu Ray release of Denver & Rio Grande is solid as well. There are a few shots that are soft, but most of them are fairly crisp and clean. There are a few instances where there is a lot of dust and debris on the print, but that doesn't happen too often. This is a solid encoding of a good (but not great) print. Both the picture and sound are very good for a film from 1952.If you like Westerns or movies about railroads do not hesitate to buy this blu ray. It's a fun movie and a very good blu ray release."
2,4th grade reading level,This book in no way gives your child reading instruction. This book which is only about five pages of articles that your child then need to answer questions on. Starting with who when why etc. The problem is the questions asked arent always in the paragraph wihch leads your child to make up and answer or give their interpretation which does not again give your child reading instruction. Comprehension maybe byt this is not what you are purchasing this book for. Waste of money and time since I had to answer most of the questions for my daughter.
2,"Not as good as ""Women on Top""","While the book was plentiful of wild, sensual fantasies, I was disappointed in some of them. Many were hard to believe even for fantasies and many sounded like they were written by illiterates. If you're looking for this type of book, I strongly recommend ""Women on Top""."
4,A Man's Perspective,"I bought this for my wife but read it myself - which man doesn't want to hear about women's sexual fantasies? The book covers a wide range of people and fantasies from highly erotic to downright disturbing. However I do have to say -WOW - some of you ladies have the most incredible imaginations!It also occurred to me as I was reading this that many women do not really understand or appreciate a man's perspective when things go awry in a bedroom. However, I think the author has given persuasive insight into issues that she has identified and she is clearly competent in this area.The author also alluded to the reasons behind some fantasies and it became obvious with the direction that some took, that they were a reflection upon the state of the woman's relationship with her husband or lover.From a man's point of view , there is a common thread among many fantasies that is good to know. Above all however, it is worth the read to satisfy the voyeur in us all."
4,What a fun read,"An amazing book covering female sexuality and specifically female sexual fantasies. Nancy Friday does a wonderful job adding commentary to some of female fantasies that were sent in by females. While at times graphic, explicit, and even really kinky at times, the book opened my eyes to the depth of the female sexual psyche and the issues regarding female sexuality in modern day culture."
5,Like this a lot!,"A great sequel to ""My Secret Garden"". The fantasies here are more explicit and provocative"
5,A revealing biography of a brilliant composer.,"Stravinsky was a fine composer who contributed to the development of modernism in art, but little about his personal life reveals his background. This biographical sketch evaluates both his music and his art, examining his contributions with a critical eye to revealing how his past influenced his creations and eventually his world. An excellent, in-depth critical profile evolves."
5,Fly = Greatest Rapper Memphis Has Ever Had,"This is the best Memphis rap album EVER. Look at rappers like Bun B., Soulja Slim (RIP), and Mac. All these cats are up there in terms of being elite Southern lyracists, and Fly deserves to be right up there with them. This CD is for the most part perfect. If not, pretty darn close to it. It's the last album we get to hear the late great Bill Chill on (RIP homie) and every track bangs. From the classic ""Nobody"" to the darker ""Start Runnin"", this CD is the total package. Plus, you had to feel Fly on ""Write Some Bump"". Most rappers who left Prophet/HCP experienced a dramatic decline in the quality of their music. Not Fly, tho. Hes one of the few rappers that seems to get better & better with every album."
4,A continuation of Book I,"Book 2 contains more complex songs than the first book, but also displays a wide range for students of differing abilities. Again, there are songs in several languages. I feel this one is a bit better than the first book, but that's my opinion. This book isn't necessarily standard repertoire with my students but I do recommend this for the more advanced sopranos that I instruct."
3,Letdown,"( Warning Spoilers)First i want to say thank you to Scorpion Releasing for even releasing an oddball movie like this, and the color matching dvd case was way cool, with that said , the movie itself is not very good. Here and there i could see promises of what i thought the movie was gonna be ,judging only from the trailer i saw on another Scorpion release. My days of buying on a whim are slowly coming to a close as i can't afford to take a chance on a movie anymore since more times than not they turn out to be just ""ok"" at best movies like Goodbye Gemini.Expected alot more camp concerning the drag performers, and i surely didn't expect the lead to get gang raped by them , nothing cute , quirky , or camp about that. So in the end i was left with an emptiness, and not because of the end of the movie, just because this movie could have been so much more ."
4,"Good, practical read","If you need a good, practical start to film sound, then this is your book. For starters it will help you to realize just how important sound is to making a good film, and how early you need to start thinking about it. It is well written and entertaining as well. Recommended to me by a sound engineer with decades of experience in the business."
1,Worthless,"Yes this book is really worthless for anyone who's looking for technical information about how to create a good motion picture sound. For more then 550 pages the author is telling about what a terrible genious he is, about how stupid all the others are, about all the stories that he was in (or is it his imagination?). It's also an add for PC Tools and Nagra (however the latter is outdated already for a long time). Don't spent your money nor time on this."
5,my son loves it!,"My son wanted a non-traditional high school ring. After looking at the local jewelers and finding cost too high, I decided to check out the offerings on line. My son decided on this ring and he loves it. Shipping was very fast. Had to return the ring for FREE re-sizing and the return was also very quick. The ring looks just as good as any that we would have had to special order at 1/3 of the price. Many thanks."
3,Could be better,"A Timeless Fashion.Not a bad sub titile. But much of that timeless fashion is left out. For example, not enough history of the origins of the timeless ""fashions."" There could be much more about the types of clothing material and its origin and how to take care of each type of clothing.The writers basically skipped around the vest, the many types of jackets, several ways to tie a tie, and so much more. Not to mentioned that they give credit to the wrong cultures for certain clothing ""discoveries.""Berhard amd Roetzel make some bad assumptions about the clothes and appliances of the households around the globe.More research need to be done before this was printed."
2,Disapointing,"Contrary to what you may read here, this book is inferior to Alan Flusser's Style and the Man. It does not take a lot of imagination to write about Kent combs; it is a mistake to describe English shirt makers but to totally ignore Italian ones; and the author often focuses too narrowly on certain brand names and on English styles, to the detriment of others. I feel the author is out of his league and lacks Flusser's expertize. Style and the Man is a far greater appreciation of men's fashion."
3,a disappointment,If you haven't purchased Alan Flusser's lavish new volume THE ART OF PERMANENT FASHION then do so before getting this book. If you still want to know more then this book MAY be of some help but ONLY if you can pick up an INEXPENSIVE used copy.
1,Too Much Hype,"Don't waste time on this book, too grandiose but too little useful advice ... A price of US$ 5 would be sufficient for the content, lots of waffle ... Better to give this a miss unless they are the only book of the genre available in the market ... not impressed with this at all."
5,One of the best men's fashion books ever published,"I own a library of most of the published volumes concerning men's fashion and fashion history. This full color, 357 page ""encyclopedia"" covers every aspect of men's clothing in depth and with compelling photos and illustrations. It's an indispensable tool for anyone interested in men's fashion."
2,"Like a linen suit, nice to have but hardly essential.","I should say that this is first and foremost a coffee table book.The main contention seems to be whether this or Flusser's book is the ""quintessential"" guide to men's style. It seems to me that this is a false dichotomy. Flusser (and might I recommend Antongiovanni's ""The Suit"") is a *guide to* men's style. ""Gentleman"" is a book *about* men's style. There is a subtle distinction here. I think it could best be described as the difference between a Time-Life book about WWII and ""The Rise and Fall of the Third Reich"". The one might be prettier, easier to read, and give you a decent overview of the subject, but if you want to get into the nitty gritty of numbers and details, you want to go with the ""real"" book.""Gentleman: A Timeless Fashion"" is a great book to keep on your coffee table and flip open occasionally, but if you want real, useful information about men's style and tailored clothing, go with Flusser or Antongiovanni."
3,This is NOT a guide to dressing professionally...,"This is a nice book if you're looking for a history of men's clothing and why certain clothing styles are the way they are. It is not a ""how to"" guide to building a wardrobe. The book is a nice addition to a library that already has other men's style guides....but don't let it be your only one."
4,I don't know why,"I don't know why the other people did not like the book, but i did i like it alot but that's my opinion."
4,war in the future,Like all mechwarrior novels you need a basic understanding of the genre and terminology but just your imagination personally a good read overall
3,It didn't really fly with me,"I am a 15 year old kid and a fan of mechwarrior. I had not really read any of the books before but I gave it a try. The word choice was difficult for me because of the foreign words and that my vocabulary is not up to par. As for the book, unless you are a fan of the RPG, computergames, or the wizkids mechwarrior game you will not really have any interest in this book. It is packed with your favorite clans or at least mine the Jade falcon. The book jumps around a lot but the book will tell u place you're jumping to and the date for convenience. Over this entire book will help you better understand the properties of these game and background to your clans."
1,Looking for plotting; found plodding,"I am an emerging science fiction author. I am also an old fan of the Mechwarrior RPG. I wanted an example of descriptive scifi action to learn from. I made a BAD choice with this book. I forced myself through the first 25 pages and threw this book across the room. Victor Milan's usage of the English language is incomprehensible. It takes him 25 pages to describe three minutes of action - and I use the word ""action"" loosely. He get's sidetracked in irrelevant topics of internal politics and sordid details of sex between siblings every other paragraph. Victor! Show us the big picture! What's going on?! I don't care about the minutia! You gotta write lean an mean when trying to write action."
1,"We Want You to Buy, No Matter it is not compatible.","Spent the best part of a day going over the ""Vista"" compatible drivers that wouldn't run off of the non-Vista-compatible CD. Finally called customer support (not a free call) to be told by the guy that my 300 Amp power supply needed to be closer to 450 amps: He sait it was right there on the box. I told him I got it from Amazon - ""Oh, but it should say right there on the box..."" ""It doesn't."" This company was willing to sell a driver which said nothing about 'Vista' in it's user/quick start manuals. Their video card won't run on the average computer but that information is not on the box or in the manual. You'll be told that the $90 power supply upgrade will fix the problem ATI has created only after shelling out $108.00. I thought I quit doing business with grade-school kids back in grade school in the 1950's but ATI has a 'new mentality'. I really can't thank you enough, or thank Amazon for not assuring that the product wasn't a pack of lies."
4,A thoughtful and perceptive artist,These notebooks are the work of a thoughtful and perceptive artist. They give insight into his own creative process. The sense I have is that they will be especially useful for artists as they touch often upon technical matters the common reader like myself does not always readily understand.
5,Happy that you finished before it finished you.,"Like most Warren Zevon fans I was saddened to hear of Warren's fatal diagnosis late last summer. I have been a fan since the beginning. I have been waiting for this CD's release since he announced on Letterman that he would try for a final effort. I had purchased Wind before he died but only received it the day I learned of his death. I expected nothing short of his normal, wry, skewed lyrics and challenging music. And I was not disappointed. It was an appropriate memorial and I hope for his friends, family and collaborators that crafting this CD gave you all joy, peace and closure. Warren I will miss you & keep you in my heart."
5,This can't be.,"""Wind"" is loaded with wit, grit, heart and soul, and all of the things we have come to love about the music of Mr. Warren Zevon.He may not be in denial about his rather nasty lot, but I am. While this is an album to be treasured with his finest works, it is virtually impossible for any listener who ""knows that this is it"" to not feel an extra punch to the head in the sad songs, ""Knocking on Heaven's Door"" for certain.To those who don't know his music, this is a perfect album. To those who DO know his music, it's even better.I will love this album until I love music no more. Thank you kind sir."
5,Excellent work,"I've been a mild Zevon fan for years, but not a full-fledged groupie. This is an excellent CD. Get's better each time I listen to it. Some songs are ""kick-ass"" (Disorder in the House), Some are touching (Please Stay, Keep me in your heart). Overall, a very satisfying collection that is ultimately uplifting. The many guest artists are a welcome addition to the production."
5,"Will miss you, Warren.","I've been listening to Zevon songs all day with a big lump in my throat. Will miss you, Warren. Thank you for sharing your thoughts and feelings with your many fans. Rest in Peace."
5,Classic Album from The Great Zevon!,"The first track ""Dirty Life & Times"" and the last track ""Keep Me in Your Heart"", of this to this quintessential Zevon album, serve as perfect bookends to his life and times. This album rocks with the best of them!! Take care Warren. We'll miss you."
5,No Weakness,"I have been a music lover for over 40 years. Very few times have Icome across an album that was solid from top to bottom. This is oneof those times. This is a classic example of saving the best for last. It has country, rock and roll, and beautiful, heart tugginglyrics that touch and speak to your heart. I don't recall the namebut the person that said there was a stumble, is missing the mark.Frank Zappa said that most people would not know good music if itbit them in the ass. I am not most people. This album is one of themost incredible pieces of work I have had the pleasure of listening to. Warren Zevon had an incredible gift. We should allthank God he shared it with us."
4,Almost too painful to listen to,"I'm a huge Warren Zevon fan. This being his last outing before his impending death was definitely done the way he wanted it. With his friends. It was like a going away party for Warren, but it's difficult to listen to. He collaborated with many of rock's greats making it not really a Warren Zevon record, but a Warren & Friends record. I prefer to listen to Warren Zevon's other records that reflect more of himself, than this record does. If you put this record into your regular rotation, you'll find yourself getting depressed. I recommend My Ride's Here, or Excitable Boy instead of this record, unless you're going to buy his entire catalog."
3,Heartbreaking,"Not the best Warren Zevon album ever (how could it be?), but almost certainly his last. While ""Knocking on Heaven's Door"" directly address his mortality, ""Keep Me in Your Heart"" will bring a tear to your eye.Revision Sept 9 - OK, so I wrote the lowest rated review and nobody thought it helpful. Don't get me wrong. I am a huge fan, I first saw Warren Zevon when he was touring for Excitable Boy (drunk as a skunk and fell off his piano) and last saw him on his solo acoustic tour (opening in Minneapolis with Jesse Ventura in the audience). I own everything he's ever recorded. The context of this album makes it one of the best and certainly the saddest. Still not THE BEST: I still like Bad Luck Streak in Dancing School and The Envoy (see if you can find it on vinyl) as better albums, but I know what everyone is feeling about this one. We will all keep him in our hearts for a long while."
5,Zevon's Last,"I have been a fan of WZ for years. I love his dark humor. This album is nothing less than a masterpiece. Given Warren's demise, it is clear that he wanted to leave us with something special and he succeded. While much has been made of ""Knockin' on Heaven's Door"", the most haunting track for me is ""Keep Me In Your Heart."" Needless to say, it is a tragedy that he isn't around to continue. If you have only recently heard of Warren, this is a CD which will convince you that he was a genius and I, for one, miss his talent."
5,Aren't We Lucky!!!,"Aren't we lucky to have this last hurrah from one of the good guys?!! I've read so many times what an acerbic cynical person Warren Zevon is, must be I am too because he strikes me as one of the last jaded romantics. This is a great CD with an emotional wallop. The perfect goodbye. It's great artistically and also it's fun to pick out the different contributors, Bruce Springsteen, Joe Walsh, Emmy Lou. Thanks Warren, it's been a great ride and you've been a wonderful companion."
4,YOU HAVE TO WONDER......,"THIS IS NOT AS STRONG AN EFFORT AS ""MY RIDE IS HERE"" BUT A MUST FOR ZEVON FANS. I CAN'T HELP BUT WONDER WHERE ALL THE 'JOHNNY COME LATELY' FANS WERE WHEN HE WAS STRUGGLING TO MAKE ENDS MEET. NOTHING LIKE DEATH TO BRING OUT ALL THE 'FANS'. I ALSO FAULT THE EXCLUSION OF 'THE WIND' FROM A CD OF THE SAME NAME THAT ENDS UP ON A TRIBUTE CD SUNG BY (AND VERY WELL) BILLY BOB THORNTON. TWISTED HUMOR FROM THE GRAVE????????"
2,"Sadly, a disappointment","I loved Warren Zevon's work and had high hopes for his sad, last original album but this one just doesn't cut it. Dirty Life & Times and Keep Me In Your Heart can be numbered among his best but the rest of the tracks are--well--lacking. I do note the exception of Knockin' On Heaven's Door--which is well-sung and arranged but still offers nothing more than what Dylan or Clapton had already given it. The much anticipated Disorder In The House has more of a jam feeling to it rather than a finished track. Nothing wrong with a good jam session but you'd like at least one of the singers to be on key. Rub Me Raw has a great blues arrangement but the lyrics aren't much. The rest of the cd is rather bland. You'd do better to look for the good complilations available out there. Maybe wait until a new one comes out with the three good tracks included from this cd. I wish it had been better."
3,I Wasn't Moved,"I hate to be a Grinch, but I didn't find this one too special. First of all, I found nothing different between this CD and Zevon's other, less recognized works. The only difference here is the circumstances under which this one was recorded. One could listen to a better Zevon work nowadays and still get the same emotional effect.Also, anyone expecting a dignified, philosophical look back at a trying life will be sorely disappointed. Zevon, as intelligent as he was, was also a bit temperamental. Knowing this, here's the message I got from the CD:""I'm dying, and I accept that. My life was crazy, and death is a welcome break. To my girlfriend, don't grieve because I was never good enough for you. To my fans, you're all a bunch of losers--except for the famous ones. Now that I'm dead, I guess I'll be more famous than I was when I was alive. Oh, and by the way, keep me in your heart when I'm gone."""
4,"True love, family tradition and magical realism","Like water for chocolate is a story about a girl's life with her family and trying to live through the harsh traditions of her culture and her mother. Though at times this story was a little unreal and strange I loved reading it. Like water for chocolate really caught my attention right from the start and every chapter had something new and exciting happen. If you enjoy magical realism, steamy love scenes and cooking, this book is definitely for you. I really enjoyed how unpredictable the book was, it made the book that much more exciting. I always wanted to know what was going to happen next. That is why I would give this book 4 stars. I hate reading, and so finding a book that I don't fall asleep reading is not common. I recommend this book to any audience."
3,magical realism?,I chose to read Like Water For Chocolate for my Senior english class at Walla Walla High School. The story started out very well but then turned into a horrible attempt at magical realism. The book was silly and not for the serious reader looking for an eventfull novel to read. Although if you like romance novels this one is the book to read.
3,English Class Review,"Like Water For Chocolate is a story written from the perspective of the main character, Tita's, grand-neice. It is a fairly well written story filled with many magical-realism scenes. For example one classic example is when one of Tita's sisters, Gertrudis takes a shower and because of the extreme heat of her body the shower shed actually catches on fire. Unfortuneately I found the book to drag on in some spots, but overall it was fairly interesting idea for the story. I would reccomend the book to anyone who likes love stories or can appreciate magical-realism."
4,like water for chocolate,"Like Water For Chocolate is a great book for all groups of people. If you like romance, and mystical novels this is the book for you. It was a little complecated to understand at times but I loved it. Coming from a haspanic background I realted to this novel and that may be why I liked it so much. I would recamend this book to teen girls it is an easy read and a very mature book. The recepies were great too."
2,fluff,"This book is a silly, weepy (and many other superlatives), Mexican lust story. It presents an absolutely terrible portrait of women."
