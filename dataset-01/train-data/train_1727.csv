1,too much talk,"She has great voice, the venue is great, but she talks incessantly. It really distracting. I would pass. I don't even want to watch again!!"
1,Filthy mouth not necessary,I bought this dvd to show our patients while they are exercising. I wish I had read the reviews first then I wouldn't have wasted my money. Not appropriate to show to my patients because of all the foul language. VERY DISAPPOINTED
1,Great Deception,"I bought 2 CD / DVD on the same day. Sade Adu - Bring Me Home - Live 2011 and Adele Live At The Royal Albert Hall. The comparison is inevitable. While Sade offers a super show with stage production, lighting, visual effects, and lots of music one after another, Adele sits on a bench for a monologue with the audience before each song. She talks, talks, talks and talks. So you're tired and decides go forward using the remote control. After some time going ahead, nothing changes, she's still talking. This happens in almost every song. I found it somewhat disrespectful .... I do not recommend this Adele's DVD to anyone."
1,Adele live at the royal albert hall(DVD/CD),Concert great....but the DVD would only play one time...i feel ripped off..i did not read this info anywhere before opurchasing
5,Adele Live,"Loved,loved,loved this DVD. Adele is totally awesome. Little surprised by the language but it was in good humor and who hasn't dropped the F word from time to time? Enjoyed hearing how the songs were written and what was going on in her life at the time.All I can say, if you like Adele and who doesn't? Get this DVD, then you will love her even more!!! I just hope she doesn't burn her candle out too soon. She is a young lady who has soooo much talent and deserves a long healthy life."
5,Very enjoyable to watch,Bought this for my wife for Christmas. She really enjoyed it and we don't usually like live concerts. The music is close to the studio version of Adele's music and her commentary between songs is priceless.
3,Too Much Cussing,"I really like Adele's voice and her song writing but I couldn't stand all the F-bombs during the concert. I won't buy a live concert DVD again, I'll just stick to the CD's."
3,Great concert - terrible language,"Don't watch this with your kids. Pretty young lady. Incredible voice. Trashy mouth. Who am I to give her advice? But, there's a time and a place for everything. If she spoke appropriately on the DVD I would recommend the DVD to the world. As it is, I wouldn't recommend it to anyone. Luckily the CD only has the music. 5 stars on the CD."
3,A good concert but......,"This lady has an incredible voice that lends itself comfortably to different genres such as jazz, blues and country. However the concert was ruined by her complete lack of education and insensitivity to the fact that not everyone who likes Adele's work enjoys hearing F-bombs every second word. Like a 10 year-old who's just discovered swearing, she uses the F-word much as another person uses adjectives.Adele, if you want to restrict yourself to concerts in London where your filthy mouth is acceptable, good luck to you. You will find, as you begin to travel the world, that your potty-mouth style will not endear you to the vast majority of the fans you crave.A very good concert marred by this one, ongoing lapse in judgment."
5,Beautiful Voice,"Absolutely beautiful dvd. Love her voice! Its for keeps in the years to come. Quality of the blu ray is good, sounds are clear and very nice."
5,Adele is just spectacular,When you listen to her words you can feel what she felt writing her wonderful music. She is truly amazing at the tender age of 21 to be this talented. Granted...she has a nasty mouth on her - which confirms she is still very young!
1,Poor Directing,"It's too bad the directing is so awful, because this is a great concert. However, the director/editor must have a huge ego, as there are so many quick cuts that it is very hard to watch. The video never lingers on anything for more than 4 seconds, and the view jumps around about 40 times per minute. Very lame and distracting from the music!"
3,Please Video another Concert - I would love it,"It is not up to me to judge Adele as she has been very successful and I like her music yet here is my opinion: If you are going to Video a concert first make sure Adele is compleltely over her chest cold, second I wish she would not let the Audience sing while she holds the Mic (Probably to rest her voice yet most singers do that anyway) because it is distracting unless you like to hear 10,000 people trying to sing, and Thirdly put a warning on the label ""Foul Language"". I did not know Adele had so much anger yet I suppose that anger and language is her persona. How can I judge such a successful singer? I cannot, but put the kids to bed first unless they are used to foul language. YET, I would BUY another. 3 stars for this concert that could have easily have been 5 Star if she had not been sick and all the other stuff. Again, I still Love her music."
4,Live,"Good entertainment. Adele comes through as talented and entertaining. Her commentary added alot to the songs but her 'earthiness"" might put some off."
4,"Buy for the f-Bombs, not Technical Quality","But that's just it, isn't it? Adele is not about gimmicks and she will show you flaws and I do agree a few instances where she doesn't hold up her voice, but that just seems to go with the content of her materials. What a foul-mouth! LOL. I keep wondering whether the Queen is thinking twice, three-time if she should have Adele over for a recital. I love the pans to the audience, thins, fats, LOTS of women and the men who reluctantly(?) accompanied the womenfolks. Buy his DVD for the show, the personality, the chats. There is probly another version for a perfect-er performance for you technical perfectionists. Adele very genuine, I wish her for more materials in the future. Stay real."
5,most enjoyable,"I just recently became aware of this beautiful and talented woman. Her voice, style and sense of humor combine for a delightful viewing and listening experience. She is a great entertainer, and I can't wait to see more of her."
3,Not HD Video,"The video is not HD, but the sound is really HQ. I expected more definition in the images, in relation with the Blue Ray format."
5,Bought its as a Christmas present for a sibling,My sister loves the dvd and was surprised to see that it came with a sound track as well.Glad she is happy so it was worth it.
4,Awesome.,Its awesome. I love her voice. Great material. The quality is perfect. The sound is great. I totally recommend this dvd.
1,SHOCKED,"I bought the DVD/CD pack as I love just about all of her songs on her 21 album. When I purchased the album, I did not think or even believe that I would be presented with so much trash talking from her. Whoever decided to produce this concert and publish it needs to be fired! My copy is going exactly where it belongs - in the trash. I am a Brit., and I am totally ashamed of her representation of a Brit. I love her music and her message, but I will never have the same feelings when I listen to her songs again as her image(for me) as been spoiled. Do not buy the DVD if you have teenagers or younger children."
1,Not received,"I have purchased This item in november, 2011. But I have not received the item so far!And Amazon.com is the seller!"
1,egh,"dont really like her voice. i do love the piano, but her voice is just annoying. it sounds like she has a cold"
3,A Must Have,"If you like Adele, this is the best alternative to watch her live. She is a superstar but very down to earth. I enjoyed every song. Blu-Ray quality not that great."
5,"Great Concert, Fantastic Voice, Satisfied Listener!",This is a fantastic concert and I have watched it too many times to count. I have showed this concert to many people and they have all throughly enjoyed it.
2,Very Disappointing,"Don't. waste your money on the Blue Ray. The sound quality was a huge let down. Sounds like stereo, not state of the art 5.1Way too much filming of the audience. It's. also hard to understand what Adele is saying when she talks between songs.She's. a great singer and we all love her music. It's. too bad the audio and video was butchered by the producer."
2,Love Adele But Hate this DVD,"I was fortunate enough to see Adele perform live last summer and was just blown away.Though I'm a lifelong music fan and an older guy, she is an old soul channeling emotions that goway beyond her 22 years on the planet.I was thrilled and excited when I saw this DVD was coming out and quickly bought a copy.Though Adele is incredible, whoever was the director of this abomination should be shot on sight.Horrible quick edits, ridiculous shots from the top of the Albert Hall behind a hanging lamp, andtoo many shots of the audience singing along.I want Adele just as she is. yes, she just stands there and sings...that's what's so powerful about her.So why do we need quick edits of boring shots of the drummer? Just give me Adele straight on singing a song withminimum quick edits and I would be a happy guy.Buy it if you must (and trust me you must), but be aware that this ADD director pretty much ruins the Adele experience."
2,"Amazing performance, nauseating editing","I LOVE Adele, and her performance is amazing, but impossible to watch on this blu-ray or DVD. As other reviewers have mentioned, the constant cuts every few seconds are nauseating. You can't even focus your eyes on anything, because the views change so fast. What a shame. Hopefully, Adele's next concert video will have a different editor/director who will let us watch her mesmerizing performance."
5,Changed my life,"I realize now, how little concerts I've been. This was absolutely amazing and I might need to buy it myself. I was shown this movie and it's unreal I loved every single second of this intimat situation. I love you Adele."
2,Love Adele hate the video director,"I Love Adele's music and was very much looking forward to this concert dvd. After two songs I left the headphones on and left the room. The music is live Adele, which is exquisite. But the video direction is nauseating. The director has many beautiful and grand camera angles at his disposal. Unfortunately, he feels he has to use every one on every song. There is absolutely no ""soul"" or feeling to the editing of the visuals, it's just a never ending series of cut after cut after cut completely destroying the mood of every song. It reminds me of watching a 1960s variety show with 2 minutes to cram every angle you've got into the time limit, but it never stops. I'll definitely continue to listen to the cd, but seriously doubt I'll ever watch the blu ray again. A bummer indeed."
2,Better buy the real album,"I love Adele more than anything but this concert is not as expected. The voice was not as good, I guess because she was already having problems with her cord. Anyway I wish I had bought the album 21 instead, at least I get better quality sound to listen in my car. The concert dvd was plain, nothing exciting considering her voice was not that great at the time."
4,as usual great Adele but what's with the sound?,"This is a wonderful presentation of Adele's talent but I have no idea who taped this thing. One minute the sound is on normal and the next it is piercingy loud. Perhaps the sound guy was on drugs....who knows???? Otherwise, a great video of a great performer live in London. She is almost better in person than on CD. A special video (except for the fool that taped it)"
4,Great artist,"A truly phenomenal performer. Oh what a voice she has!Finally another artist who writes her own stuff and actually performs live. Apart from Lady GaGa, she is one of few who actually does both.Well worth it if you enjoy a real performer with real talent."
5,Captures the magic...,"A really beautiful blu ray concert production. Looks and sounds amazing. I was fortunate to see Adele in Salt Lake City in August and this dvd captures the mood, energy, and charm of her show very well. Seeing Adele live is a real joy and this disc does a great job of transporting the viewer."
5,Fantastic!,"I had to buy this after watchng it on YouTube, was afraid it might get pulled from there. Wonderful voice and Adele is very funny! Love the way she is so personable with her audience. Thoroughly enjoyable!"
5,Historical Adele Concert - 2 in 1 !,Must own by all Adele lovers. Great performance by Adele and her audience at The Royal Albert Hall. You get a CD for your car or home stereo if you are one of those who still uses CD players and you also get Adele's historical concert on crystal clear Blu-ray DVD.
5,LOVE IT,"I LOVE THIS I WATCH IT ALMOST EVERYDAY, SHE SOUNDS WONDERFUL ON MY SURROUND SOUND. LOL : ) : ) : ) : )"
5,Adele Live at The Royal Albert Hall,Love the music and the DVD. Terrific concert!Recommend to other music lovers and it makes a good introduction to a talented singer.
5,Love,It's everything I ever expected and hoped for from Adele! She says that she wants the expereience to be like sitting down with friends and it definitely feels that way.
5,Adele,Amazing CD! Adele at her best.Shipment was priced great and came super fast and in great condition.Good quality.
3,She swears like a drunken sailor,I wouldn't recommend playing this when kids are around due to her course language. Given her talent the cussing is entirely unnecessary.
3,Disappointing,"I had high hopes for this video. I like Adele and her music so I figured I'd love the video. But I don't. It is nearly unwatchable because they change the camera angle literally every second, sometimes twice per second! Also the quantity of foul language from Adele is completely unnecessary and gratuitous. It gets three stars only because she sounds great while singing. In fact, I enjoy this video more with my eyes closed. Why did I even buy a VIDEO??"
4,Mixed feelings,"Adele is a truly phenomenal talent. She is one of the most exiting artists to emerge for a long time.Apart from some deficiencies in the quality of the DVD, her use of profanity and the level and tone of her banter detracts from her amazing musical ability.She is still young and will no doubt realize that her musical appeal transcends age groups and that she has style and charisma.She does not need to seek sensation because her music speaks for itself."
3,Disappointed,I really like Adele's music and enjoyed the video quality. I was very disappointed that Adele used so much foul language. I would have liked to share this video with my grand daughters and my parents. I did neither. She can sing but I wish she showed a little more class.
4,Adele Live,"The singing and performance were outstanding as expected by the artist Adele. However, what was so disappointing was her ""potty"" mouth. I just don't think it is appropriate to drop the f%^# bombs. It is totally unnecessary and absolutely unlady like. Whatever happened to be being a lady?"
3,The worst of the originals,"Ok, im sorry, but i have to say this ""Tighten up vol.88"" is probally the Original BAD's worst album, it is ok, but maybe just a bit inconsistant.it lacks the spark ""This is Big Audio Dynamite"" and ""NO. 10 Upping Street"" and the great dance beats of ""Megatop Phoenix"".Maybe BAD's own little Sandinista? Ok, it is no where near as good as Sandinista.But casual BAD fans should stear clear of this album, the hardcore BAD fans... well they should allready own it :DBest Tracks:- ""Other 99"", ""Just Play Music"" and ""Funny Names"""
2,Directionless?,"Most fans would've been ""dismayed"" with this album. It could be considered a most 'unlikely' album from them, following from previous releases, such as 'This Is Big Audio Dynamite'.Immediately, one wonders what they had in mind with this album. All the tracks are different, but by and large, the material is 'light'. A few tracks are ""catchy"" and worth an ear, but you won't be satisfied by the end of the album.Get it to complete a collection. Listen to it incessantly for a couple of days. Then file it away among your other ""Play Every Ten Years"" albums!Fave Track: 'The Battle Of Old Saints Road'"
1,Dull. Next!,"Big Audio Dynamite always felt like a contrived mix of poor lyrics and messy cut-up techniques. This album hardly proves that assertion wrong. By combining unexciting compositions with the most lacklustre vocal content possible, the band have truly excelled at making a product so terribly dull that it hardly merits any sort of attention. Admittedly, the pace does pick up at the very end: ""Tighten Up, Vol. 88"" and ""Just Play Music"" finally get it right, and they managed to inject a bit of house influence into their work. Its a good prelude to the better (but messier) Megatop Phoenix from 1989. But, given that you'll have to wade through an album's worth of weak dreck, it's hardly even worth it.If you already like the band, go for it. If you're looking for an introduction, there's other things to check out. The debut, Megatop Phoenix and BADII's The Globe are better than this piece of work."
1,Overpriced and leaky,"Bought this about five years ago, and the only good thing I can say is that when it first started leaking, they quickly sent a replacement cartridge. But it has ALWAYS been very tight to operate when equipped with the short handle as the wife demanded (don't know about the long handle).Finish wore very poorly, lasting about a year to eighteen months before showing bare spots of copper.And now it has started leaking badly, and it must be swung to the hot water side to stop the leak.The sprayer hose is so weak that it must be held with the hose in a straight position or it will stop the water with the old bend the hose trick.The soap dispenser is out performed by most of the dispensers you can pickup at the five and dime.For the four hundred or so that we paid, one might think a better product could be had, but it isn't this product."
5,I hope to hear claude chalhoub's music in a movie soundtrack,i love this cd. i received an email about the release of this cd. i wasn't familiar with the artist but the description was just what i was looking for. i ordered it. i'm glad i did. i especially like 'Red Desert'. i keep this song on repeat mode. the others are great too. i must admit i dont like the vocals on track 3.i often skip that one. the talent is great but the vocals just tend to irritate me after a short while. my two favorites-red desert and oriental images.
5,"Work great for the price, not too hard to use","I got this bike pump to use with an old mountain bike I had not ridden in years. Maybe serious bikers wouldn't like it, but it works great for me (though I have not attached it to the bike, so I can't comment on those issues mentioned by other reviewers). I don't know if the gauge really works. It may, but I did not really look at it while using the pump. I found that my tried-and-true method of feeling the tires and then testing them out worked perfectly well. It may be a bit more difficult to use than the type you put on the ground and pump up and down, but for anyone healthy enough to ride a bike it should not be a problem. Also, I love that it is so small and compact!"
1,Wrong product,really upset. order this pump because it had a gauge and was told it could fit presta & schraeder valves only to find out it could only fit schraeder valve!!!!!
2,What you see is not what you get,I received the product on the box itself it states water bottle cradle included. It was not ant hte product looks different than the box it came in.Also it is suppose to attach to bike how I don't have a clue.Two screws come attached to box without any instructions or illustrations.I just throw the pump in a bag and call it a day. By the way the pump itself works everything else about it sucks.
4,Nice little pump,I bought this pump to pump up tubes on my bike tire when I get flats. For mountain biking this is a great small and light weight pump which just means you will have to do a lot of pumping to fill up a totally flat tube. The PSI gauge never seems to read correctly and the gauge was the main reason I bought this pump. The supplied mounting bracket for you bike seems to made for kids bikes. It is way to small to fit on the frame of my mountain bike. Still works nicely thrown in the CalmBack.
3,eh...,"PROS:-it worked well when I tested it right after buying.CONS:-got a flat doing a nasty downhill. swapped the tube, and went to pump up the tire. That is when I found out that the gray screw on adapter piece had rattled off the pump while attached to my bike frame. I recommend taping it on or try another pump.Other than the cap issue....its a good pump"
3,decent for emergency!,"This mini bike pump is hard to pump air at 120 psi, it requires a lot of effort, but still works... I didn't like where the gauge was placed, it should of been placed some where better for better viewing. but It is easy to pump at lower pressure such as 45 psi and etc.For emergency, if you have a flat tire and you are stuck, you don't have to pump it all the way to 120 psi, but around 60 psi will get you going. Overall this is great pump for mountain bikes and other low pressure tires, but for road bikes it's not that great but it's decent for emergency! At home i have the regular hand pump, and use this bike pump as a gauge."
5,I use this as my main bike pump due to its features!,"This pump is very easy to use. The built-in pressure gauge makes it easy to see the current pressure. This is one of my favorite purchase for my road bike. I use this little pump as my main pump by choice due to the size, gauge and easy of use. Its always on the bike so I can add air within a couple of seconds compared to getting out a big pump and gauge."
1,"Broke on 3rd use, weak","I got this a couple months ago. I thought the gauge and compact size were good features. I used it to pump up a set of new tires once and again a few weeks later for a pressure adjustment. Then I noticed my back tire seemed a little soft on the ride to work one morning. As soon as I tried to attach the pump to the valve, the head practically exploded! I couldn't find all the pieces. Topeak may have some good products, but this is NOT a good first impression with me. I logged on to some biking websites and found that many other riders had similar experiences with the Mini Master Blaster series. Too weak and fell apart easily."
2,Gauge does not work.,"Just what the title says: Ok for a pump. Gauge does not work. Never has. I'm rather disappointed, since that was the major reason why I purchased it. There are no replacement parts for the gauge, so you're stuck returning it. Good luck."
2,"Poor instructions, design, and quality","Purchased this because it said it works with all valve types. The cardboard that came attached to this item had vague, hard to find Heiroglyphics explaining how to switch pieces to make it work on a Presta valve. The Topeak website and support were useless. Luckily I had seen other ads about other brand pumps with a similar design to figure it out what to do. It still took a couple of weeks and multiple flat tires to realize that one of the parts that had to be removed was not going to come out without some force and proper ""locking handle"" positioning. Even when it is working the gauge is difficult to read and does not give a reading unless pumping. Pumps' internal valve also seems to allow the withdrawing of some air backwards into the pump creating more work than necessary. The mount also sticks out a little too much causing your leg to hit it occasionally while pedaling."
4,Topeak Mini G MasterBlaster Bike Pump with Gauge,I ordered one when deployed in Afg. for a bike and it worked great. No complaints about the gage either.
2,Product Description is Incorrect!,"According to the product description, this pump is supposed to include a fold-down footrest and an inflation hose. In fact it has neither!"
3,Decent Pump,"I purchased this pump to attach to my bike for emergencies on long rides, which I was able to do with no problems using the included clip. It takes a LOT of muscle to get it up to the 120 PSI required for my road bike, but bikes that require lower pressures aren't that difficult, and it's better than nothing if you're stranded somewhere with a flat. My only complaint is that it is a little tricky getting the pump attached to a valve stem without losing any air."
4,Great little pump,"As a big-time sports family, we constantly carry a pump with us to ensure the soccer ball, football, basketball, etc., are always ready for action. My husband has been saying how much he would love to find a mini pump with a gauge so he could properly inflate the balls. We searched for ages until I finally came upon this and bought it. Although it's a wonderful little pump, the gauge is specifically designed for tires rather than balls. The increments on it are too wide to determine smaller numbers. It still works, but does not show the lbs. for ball inflation. That said, it's fabulous for use on our bikes and I'm still very happy I bought it."
4,"Good value, not perfect.","I wanteded two mini-pumps, so I purchased both the Mini-DXG as well as the Mini-G models. The DXG is a little shorter, with slightly improved frame mounting, but general performance is the same. Both have a built-in pressure gage that works, but I don't expect it to be very accurate. Both pump air during IN and OUT strokes, which was much more difficult than a floor pump, but I plan to use these for emergencies only. Both frame-mounts will position the pump next to the bottle cage, using the same screws for the bottle cage. This was OK except when I bike with casual long pants, my pant cuffs would catch on the pump lever if mounted on the left side, and if mounted on the right side, it's too close to the bike chain. This is not a big deal because I just carry these in my bike bag, but I would've liked it much more if it would've just velcro-mounted to my top bar."
4,Nice Mobile Bicycle Pump!,"I use mine as a carry-along bicycle pump for my road bike. I routinely pump my tires up to about 120 psi. But at these pressures, pumping up the bike is a real chore, it's definitely a workout, but it works! The pressure guage reads maybe 5-10 psi too high from my digital guage, but it's a good ballpark estimate.. Works fine with presta valves.This is the only pump I own and it gets very difficult pumping up the tires every few days at home. So definitely invest in a home foot pump and use this when you're on the road or don't have access to an easy high-pressure pump.Good to have for sure!"
4,Topeak Mini G MasterBlaster Bike Pump with Gauge,"Great pump for the price. Will pump up to 120 psi with realitive ease. The gauge makes it easier than most small pumps, to see tire pressure, instead of guessing. Overall-very satisfied"
5,It's a good little pump.,"It pumps air on the in AND out strokes. It has a little gauge that seems to work (I haven't had it very long so it's still new and the gauge looks pretty flimsy). It has adapters for a couple types of valve stems. The mounting system is a bit strange; it is meant to be mounted ""sideways"" on your bottle holder. You cannot use the included mount to attach this thing to your bicycle directly. Also, be aware that the mounting screws are VERY loosely attached on the retail package so they sometimes fall off and get lost during shipping. However, Amazon is good about getting a fast replacement if that happens... you will just need to re-pack the one with the missing screws and print a (free) return shipping label for UPS."
3,Not a smart head,"The pump is little on the heavy side, pressure gauge works but I did not need it. The head is not smart head you have to unscrew the top and change the arrangement inside to make it work with different type of valves. Pumping is easy if you want to be at 40 psi.."
4,alright,"The pump does its purpose great. Compact hand pump to bring with and use occasionally. I would not advise using this as your main tire pump, as repeated use can possibly damage your valve stem, not to mention it takes A LOT of pumps to pump a tire! the only problem is that the pressure gauge can get stuck sometimes while pumping. For me it is around the 30psi point. To solve it, remove the pump and re attach, and it will give you a higher reading."
4,Great compact pump for the price,"Very compact, easily clips to your frame or fits in a pack. Has worked consistently well for about 6 months now."
1,Bike Pump,The little adapter piece fell off on my fist ride than the thing was usless.Better to buy a little compressed air kit that includes patches too.
1,Does not work on draw stroke!,"This pump looks very sophisticated with very original piston / plunger design. When it comes to mating with the Schrader valve the rubber well is too shallow to accomodate this valve so no effective tight seal is formed aroud the valveMore importantly with any type of valve, it does not allow to draw the air back in on a draw stroke . No internal draw valve?Bottomline: totally useless!!!!!"
2,Bad guage bulky pump,The gauage does not work over 60 PSI and it's not worth the cost. Leave this for someone else and get a better pump.
3,It pumps...,"Not good for higher psi (90-100, forget about it), and the gauge is useless. For the price though it's a good pump if you're a mountain biker, or anyone without a road bike."
2,NO DIRECTIONS included... none available on the net!,"It may be a wonderful pump, but I cannot tell. There are NO DIRECTIONS on how to use it. I went on line to seek directions. All I found were dozens of posts from other people who are frustrated that there are NO DIRECTIONS at all. Also, the print that is on the box is so small that I had to get a magnifying glass to read it. My regular glasses were not enough. I tried to contact the Topeak and their contact information is also impossible to find. This is very bad customer service!"
1,"Breaks valves, pumps backwards","I should have known after the first 2 broken valves, but I thought 'oh well, must not have pulled it out straight.' Well, I lucked out for a while and used a pump I bought at work for a while, until it got locked in a room I didn't have access to. I decided to use this again, and not only did it break another valve, but now it sucks air out the nozzle and pumps it out the handle. Get a Lenzyne and forget about this piece of trash, (mine, by the way, is now in the trashcan next to me)."
3,Not for all bikes,This pump is only useful if your wheels do not have a lot of spokes. The lever that locks the pump in place on the air intake valve will want to push the spokes out of the way when you flip it up. The spokes will get in the way when you want to flip the lever down.
2,OK if you don't need more than 60 psi,The pump is advertised for more than 100 psi but I found it nearly impossible to get more than 60 psi out of it.
2,small but tiring,"i bot this for my road bike. the pump looks really cool and easy to use. but try to pump your tire to above 100 psi is more difficult than lifting 100 lbs of weight in gym. I promise if i need to use it more than once every half a year, i will throw it away and get the most huge and stupid one."
4,It does what it says it will do,"This is a good little pump. It is reliable and has a decent gauge. It holds on to the bike stem really well. My only hesitation is that it is hard to pump, especially because it pumps in both directions. Although it pumps quickly, not everyone may have the strength to use it when pumping to 80 pounds of pressure. However, I would buy it again."
3,"Good pump, what gauge?","I bought this frame mounted bike pump because I wanted to keep myself from having to walk my mountain bike 10 miles back to my house. And to do that, I would need to have a psi gauge also. So I thought I would get this little doodad. When it arrived, I slightly emptied my front inner tube to test the pump, but the gauge did not work at all. The pump did wonders, getting to 60psi with no problem but I couldn't use the little gauge to see how much psi I pumped it. I had to use my floor pump to check and I can't take that on my epic rides, that's just weird. Anyway, it's a great little pump but the gauge is useless. I'm not sure if it's a defective item, but I'm not going to out of my way to get another one. I returned the pump and bought a different one."
2,Eats presta valve needles,"Don't buy if you have a bike that uses presta valve tubes and/or requires tire pressures greater than 80 psi. I bought this pump for my old bike which was a hybrid and used shraeder valve tubes (the one you see on cars). It worked great and even bailed me out a couple times on the road. Since I switched to my most recent bike that uses presta valves, this pump has been an utter failure. The pump puts too much physical pressure on the valve. You have to kind of force pump's head onto the valve. More than that, it's a small handpump so it's fairly weak. You'll have to put in a lot of effort to get the tires inflated to a high psi. All the yanking and pulling you'll be doing while pumping will spell disaster for the already frail presta needles. I went through 5 tubes in one week with this pump. They all had their valves broken off. I honestly can't recommend this pump for presta valves in any scenario."
3,Mini Dual G - Figued out the Presta Function,"This is a good product. However, the instructions are CRAP when it comes to how to switch valve types (From Schrader to Presta).Step 1: Unscrew the capStep 2: Look at the inside of the ValveStep 3: lift the lever.Step 4: pull out the part that just movedStep 5: Flip the two parts so they match and re-insert...If all else fails watch this video from the manufactures website[...]"
4,Does the Job,PROS:- Does the job- Very compact and lightCONS:- instructions were not clear on how to switch from Schraeder to Presta valve. I found a useful video on youtube on how to switch valve types:http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=46VAsFHf4kA- gauge doesn't seem to work
2,"It works, but not very well.","I had this pump for a year. While this might work well for a MTB that needs only 80 PSI of pressure, it's horrible for a road bike that needs 120 PSI. Unless you're a zen-master, you'll find it impossible to generate the power to push the air into the valve without moving and possibly breaking the valve-stem. Often I was forced to just ride with 80 PSI, which then got me more flats. It was really frustrating.Instead buy Topeak's Road Morph, it has all the same features, but it's built more like a floor pump where you can get the necessary leverage to push all 120 PSI into your tire."
2,"Bad locking system, Gauge difficult to read.","Be careful with this pump. The locking system is counterintuitive and not user-friendly. To lock the nozzle, lift the handle. To unlock it, lower the handle. And twice my skin got caught in the lock hinges as it was snapping shut. Also, the gauge is difficult to read. I will be returning this immediately."
4,Like it so far,"Unlike most people here, my gauge works fine. I bought the avenir streetster kevlar tires and installed the standard schrader valve inner tube from avenir, and , this pump puts my tires at 80-90 psi, at their rating. I can see the psi go up as i pump. Very small and fits in my laptop bag. very statisfied"
4,All-time classic,"It's an all-time classic in computer graphics world. I bought this in 1997 and i could learn a lot from it. Though it hasn't been updated, one can gain all the fundamentals about CG."
2,Get Subcription to Siggraph Instead,"Except for the chapters on raster algorithms, this book is just an extended bibliography. It has no material on texturing, for example, just a reference to the original paper on it. The math isn't that mature either, and the chapter on Perspective Projections is a pedagogical atrocity. Instead of buying this book, just go to your local univ. library and xerox the bibliography; then, lookup the articles on topics you're interested in."
3,This is a math book or programming book ??,"It's all about theory and math. Yes, it contains everything about computer graphic, it's complete, but I can't produce anything from it. For example how can I build raytracing program with only two pages of pseudocodes + few pages of theory ???. The author only introduce the subject, give you the formulas, sometime pseudocodes ( and you have to find your own way to implement them in programming ) and NEXT SUBJECT !!!. That why the book is very complete. I don't know if I'm stupid or this book is too hard, but one thing for sure the guys who love this book must be a MATH MASTER. I salute you !!!"
5,The most broadly useful graphics book in existence.,"This book will acquaint you with nearly every graphic technique and algorithm. It's THE book to have if you expect to be involved in more than a narrow range of graphics programming. If your ambition is limited to writing a Quake-like engine, you'll find yourself mouthing silliness like ""it covers too many topics, many of which are trivial and unimportant such as the coverage of 2D graphics."" This book does not hold your hand; the algorithms are explained thoroughly but you are expected to write your own code. If you're looking for off-the-shelf solutions or a way to cheat on your homework, this isn't your book.I've owned this book for nearly ten years and have turned to it time and again when taking on new tasks related to graphics - color space conversions, lighting algorithms in 3D, dithering, 2D primitive rendering for print graphics, and many more... it's the best value I've ever gotten in a computer-related book."
3,Wide ranging but dated information,"An excellent book for the basics of computer graphics and for the advances up until 1990 [when the second edition was released]. Much of the information is out of date (like a lot of the 2D ""Simple Raster Graphics Package"" stuff, and text talking about circa 1980 plotters, scanners, and keyboards. None of the exciting developments from 1990 to 1998 are included. This book was an easy 5 stars when the second edition came out in 1990, but now I'd suggest the Watt books to get a good general overview of computer graphics."
2,This is a poorly organized book that is difficult to read.,"The first problem with this book is that it covers too many topics, many of which are trivial and unimportant such as the coverage of 2D graphics. The result is a massive 1100 page book that's difficult to read but doesn't explain anything in great detail. Second, the pseudocode presented in the book is virtually useless. You'll have to write all your programs from scratch. Finally, many people may not care but I don't like books with fine print and tissue thin paper.This is not a book that you can read while sipping a glass of wine - this is a book that demands massive concentration. Although computer graphics can be math intensive, it is not nuclear physics and should be relatively easy to grasp, but you wouldn't know from reading this book."
1,Big useless bore,"Proud to be a New York City resident, I bought this book because I wanted to learn what kind of haunted places we have (other cities, like London, are full of them). This book is incredibly boring and has no style to it whatsoever. Furthermore there are so many spelling and grammer errors that I wondered if the author has finished high school. If you are interested in New York City ghosts, there is a walking tour of the cities haunted sites. This book was a waist of money."
1,Great looking 3rd break light but.....,"Installation is easy and quick, looks great in the truck, giving a much clear look.But after installation the 6 white LEDs that is suppose to illuminate the truck bed did not work, took it apart, unplug and plug back in, open the truck door and again nothing!!after trying for over 30 min. I decide to leave the truck door open unplug everything and plug the old 3rd break light and it work perfect, them I unplug it again and plug the Putco and the light work.Screw everything back in place whit the light on, and after close the truck door and let it sit for couple minutes.... Again no light!!!!I don't know what to do to fix it!!!The instructions are clear "" Plug and Play""I would not recommend this product to anyone!!!"
4,Great straight ahead rock,"Made in USA in 2000, Serial# COL-CD-6451, Playing Time: 70 min.""Big Deal"", their 3rd album, was originally released in 1988 and was named after the fact the band finally signed a contract with a major record label (a big deal!).This re-mastered version also includes as a bonus the first 6 of 12 tracks that would appear on their 5th album, ""Method To The Madness""; 5 more show up on the re-mastered version of ""Dirty Weapons"".""Big Deal"" finally allow the band to make a better produced album, with commercial polish and catchy songs. Their style reminds me a bit of RATT, early MOTLEY CRUE, and FIREHOUSE, with no keyboard textures. It contains the small hit ""We Stand Alone"".Grab this one if you like good rock, good singing, without getting into the ""metal"" genre."
3,give me a break!,"This review has nothing to do with the book. I am writing in to say how taken aback I am at the narrow minded reviewer who said that the author is on his way to hell because he is going against what the bible says and taking everyone who even considers this book with him. Spoken like a true Christian-NOT! Maybe he should slow down on the hateful reviews and re-read that book that he and people of his ilk quote so confidently from all the time and broadcast their ignorance of Jesus' teachings to the world. I in no way pretend to know the bible from front to back, but I do seem to recall Jesus saying something or another about tolerance and love. Well if the author is on his way to hell, he'll be in plenty of company--and I'm sure they will still be quoting the good book there too. I'm sorry about being so outspoken but I have had enough of this bull! Sir, you are an embarrassment to the Christian community."
1,smaller than they say,"We bought this as an upgrade to our traditional 8X8 Bounce 'Round that is 3 years old (very duarble product). We wanted a bit more jumping room. The 8x8 has a jumping area of 6x6, the Beach Bounce 'Round advertised as a ""full 7x9 feet of jumping space"" actually has a jumping space of less than 5x7. Way too small for one 5 year old, never mind 2 kids. Do not buy this version."
3,Size is Misleading,"We just received this bounce around today so as far as durability, I can't give an accurate review. The one thing I can say is that it IS NOT 9ft by 7ft of jumping space, not even close. For the price, I don't regret the purchase, my 3 and 5 year old can jump in it together just fine but there isn't a lot of space. I do wish I would have invested a little more and just bought the one I saw at Sams Club. After the price of shipping, I came close to spending that anyway. For the cost, it is a good deal but don't be fooled by the jump space advertised. Only purchase if you have very small children."
3,Good but not... entertaining... you know?,"I purchased this book after ""For Love of Insects"" and found it to be substantially dryer and less enthused than that work. Though every bit as informative, it lacks the oomph of that fascinating book."
5,The Work of a Genius,"Arnold Schoenberg is one of the most brilliant minds of the twentieth century, not just in the field of music. This is not only an excellent reference of some of his seminal writings, but it's also a great read for anyone who would like a better understanding of the musical landscape of the early 20th century through the eyes of a genius. His scholarship is just as beneficial to us as his compositions."
4,Surprising!!!,"Well! What a book! I am a huge fan of Sandra Dallas, but I will say, after getting about half-way through this book, I really wasn't impressed. The stories of Addie and Ned just kind of mosied along, nothing overly exciting, but once the book turned to Emma's tale...wow!!I truly didn't realize just how much everyone was out to screw each other over, and the way everything went down was completly surprising! This really is a great book, I only gave it 4 stars because as I said, the first half was a little slow...but stick with it! The last half will make the pages fly by!"
4,Just when you think you have it figured out..,"THINK AGAIN! The plot twists and turns at the end of the book so many times!I love reading about books from my home state and thisone was such a gripping tale of who is really the ""bad guy"". Make sure you leave lots of time because once you get into it, you won't want to put it down!"
2,A light-hearted read spoiled by graphic violence,"The Chili Queen: A NovelI really enjoy most of Sandra Dallas' works, and in particular the Persian Pickle club. This one was lighter than most, with a touch of farce. What ruined it for me was the graphic description of the violent end of Emma's husband and daughter. While the event sets up her motives, we could have got the idea without reading about how her 7 year old is raped and her skull is crushed. That image overpowered the rest of the story."
1,This Book Is Sick,"I loved The Persian Pickle Club, so I picked up The Chili Queen from the library. It started with a character who was the madam of a whorehouse, so, considering the warmth of The Persian Pickle Club, I figured it was a story of redemption. Wrong! There are no likeable characters. They are, to a person, all amoral people committing immoral and illegal acts. I kept waiting for one of them to change, but no, they were evil right to the end. Although Dallas writes well, and her description of people generated a few laughs, and the plot twists were a bit of a surprise (although I guessed one), at the end of the book I felt sick and very sorry I had read it. Oh, and she throws in the detailed rape and murder of a seven-year-old girl. I need a shower."
2,So predictable,"I loved Sandra Dallas' Tall Grass so I thought I would read another Sandra Dallas book, but, I was very disappointed.There were moments that I liked the book but it was so predictable. The only twist was that Welcome was a man, other than that, the story and its ""twists"" were extremely obvious.It was a quick read but not worth the little time needed to read it. But, do read Tall Grass, since it was a very well written book that was well thought out."
1,Unlikeable and Unlikely,"What a disappointment! After reading the Persian Pickle Club, I made a point to read all of Sandra Dallas' work and was thrilled to find a new entry. However, there is NO charm, no real plot, no redeeming characters, and no reason to suffer through some of the worst dialogue ever written. The plot eases from tedious to convoluted, the characters are not only unlikeable but unlikely, the New Mexico setting is given only a cursory look, and for this reader, the book was a Big Mistake."
3,Not one of my favorites...,"While I like most of Sandra Dallas' books - generally historical fiction set in a variety of periods and places - I thought this one was sort of lacking her usual charisma. I have to admit, this story about a whorehouse madam in 1880s Arizona, her bank-robber boyfriend, and a mail-order bride who latches onto them after her groom rejects her is well-written -- none of the characters are who they appear to be, and the ending totally had me going, ""WOW! Never would've suspected THAT..."" But after I finished, I was also just left with a sense of...eh."
5,Entertaining book by Sandra Dallas,I found this book very entertaining and did not want to put it down. There was so much going on. All the characters were very interesting and as you read deeper in the book you found more things out about them. I loved this book. Certainly was not boring. Sandra Dallas did a fantastic job writting this book.
3,Who is in on it??,"I had no idea what to expect with this book and it was full of surprises. I loved that! You knew that a con was going on but you had no idea who was in on it. The setting is a whore house which really threw me for a loop wondering what I was getting into, but the plot was very interesting."
4,A realistic yet funny historical novel,"Sandra Dallas has written a fully entertaining historical novel complete with plots and counter plots. The characters are entertaining and engaging. Oddly enough, there seems to be no antagonist; just protagonists interweaving with each other. I liked that the female characters were presented with alternatives and choices that were consistent with the time the novel was set in.The plot twists and character interaction was delightful. The madam, Addie French, is fully believable, as is the bank robber, Ned Partner. Welcome, Addie's hired help, is a subtle but necessary character of the novel. The distressed heroine, Emma Roby, is delightfully suprising. This book is a wonderful read and may keep you up turning pages past your bedtime!"
1,Nothing like The Diary of Mattie Spencer,"Having read The Diary of Mattie Spencer, I was anxious to read another of Sandra Dallas' books. The Chili Queen was a huge disappointment. It was not even close to being believable. The characters were shallow and the plot was even worse."
1,I was extremely disappointed,"Sandra Dallas has been one of my all time favorite authors and I have loved all of her previous books. I was very excited to read The Chili Queen and about 25 pages into it, it dawned on me that this was a very corny book. I ended up skipping over most of it and still got all the scams. When the author is so busy being clever that she forfeits depth and quality, I find the book a big joke. There was only a brief few pages where there was an inkling of the *real* Sandra Dallas and that was when she was describing Emma's previous life."
5,Out of Print !(Huge Shame),"This book is the final word on windows debugging. Not surprising since it comes from one of the authors of the award winning software: ""Bounds Checker""I really enjoyed the chapter on x86 assembly. It covers what needs to be known to read through assembly code when the debugger tosses it at you.Trying to list all the good stuff in the book will take more time than I can devote right now. What I don't understand is why the book is now out of print. I'm sure some people out there still want to stick to native code and these people deserve to have this book. I'm happy I got mine before it went under."
5,The Best Damn Book,Just buy it. One of his advanced breakpoint tips alone will will save you more than enough time to pay for the book five times over.

1,Beck/Arnley 012-5352 Engine Piston w/Rings,"These were the wrong pitons for my application. They were suspose to be for a Toyota 4AGE engine and they were not. Received 4 different sets and all were wrong. Someone messed up with packaging or something, but 4 sets wrong?"
4,"IMPORTANT, DISTURBING AND GRIPPING","Artist Julien Schnabel directs a potent and disturbing portrait of the conditions that surround Miral, a former orphan and now a 17 year old teacher in a Palestinian refugee camp who becomes enamored of a political activist that puts her in a very dangerous place: to fight like those before her or seek an education that will lead to peace. Freida Pinto is terrific as the vulnerable Miral. Willem Dafoe co-stars. The Weinstein brothers took a lot of heat from some fellow Jews for producing a film that attempts to humanize the Palestinians. It's a small world; maybe it's not too late to recognize that we are all part of one great human family. This important film does not betray the core of shared Judeo-Christian ethics but rather confirms them."
4,Enjoyable for knowledgable audiences,"Miral is the story of a Palestinian girl growing up in the middle of the Israeli-Palestinian conflict. Unlike most media representations of this conflict, this story is told from the Palestinian perspective. I congratulate director Julian Schnabel for his courageous movie and for giving us a unique perspective.Although Miral tells a personal story, viewers will understand the personal story better if they have some knowledge of the political backdrop. Schnabel gives us a bit of help with the context, but he expects us to come into the movie with a general understanding of the history of the Israeli-Palestinian conflict. I've studied the conflict in some depth, so I was able to easily follow the action and the political developments. However, I'm guessing many Americans, particularly those in the younger generations, don't have that kind of understanding these days."
3,"Not so extraordinary or unique, but a decent movie","I found this to be an interesting movie that I was glad to have watched, but at the same time it wasn't as compelling as I thought it would be considering the subject matter and it was a one-time only movie for me. I think part of the problem for me was that for the first 30 minutes, it felt like everyone was reading their lines from a cue card and I didn't really emotionally connect to the characters. It got better after that, but the camera work was very distracting. The actor who played the father was really good in his role, beyond him I'd say the acting was mediocre. It does make you think and overall it was worth watching, but I don't think it lived up to the hype on the box of ""Miral has an extraordinary and unique power""."
2,"Good movie, not great though","Moving story about a Palestinian girl coming of age in a turbulent world. The shoddy camera work was amateurish and annoying. Did the director really think it was a good idea to constantly remind people that it's just a movie and nothing else? How is the audience supposed to get ""into"" a movie if they have to constantly focus away in order to avoid motion sickness? Just leave the camera alone and stop running around with it! That's what teenaged kids do when making their own home movies.Other than that, it was a decent film without much depth to it. The music cues on how we should be feeling during a particular scene was another amateur move. Sad music, sad scene. Lively music, happy scene. Sometimes no music is just fine, let the acting do the work.I was truly hoping for a great movie that is sympathetic to the Palestinian cause. Unfortunately, I didn't find that with Miral."
2,"I did not find the movie entertaining, in fact it was a struggle to watch!","A lot of the dialogue was hard to understand and, because of that, it was hard to follow the storyline. I am not even going to pretend like I knew what was going on, but from what I could tell it was an okay movie. The characters weren't really fully developed and the storyline seemed sketchy. I really could not recommend this movie to anyone."
4,Just where do we grow up free?,"Palestine / Israel is a place where people have been at war since 1946.The European Jews were ""given"" a homeland by a guilty western societyafter the Nazis killed millions of them. Instead they gavethem the lands and heritage of the Palestinians.When Alexander the Great was faced with this sort of situation in his ""Empire"",he forced his Greek officers to marry eastern/ Persian women.Outside of moving to another country Palestinians are treated much likethe American Indians/ Native American or Australian Aborigines.Fighting back has just not worked.Miral grows up finding she has no rights even as an Israeli citizenand finally, when nothing is left..."
5,AMAZING !,GREAT FILM ! I cried a lot...You will love it! This is really amazing film which about Palestinian people's life under the Israel's cruel political rules...Widely Famous anchor woman ; Rula Jebral's autobiographical life...
5,"Interesting, informative film","Finally an interesting film! Loved Miral! The story is very engaging, while educating the audience about the Palestinian-Israeli conflict from the perspective of Palestinians living in Israel. The film subtly captures the second class citizenship of Palestinians while illuminating the complexities of ""terrorism"" as a form of protest and military engagement for disenfranchised populations.The film has beautiful cinematography. The only negative was that Freida Pinto's performance was somewhat limited. She is breathtakingly gorgeous but doesn't have much range as an actor. She widens her eyes to look angry, but just comes off looking crazy. I wish the lead had gone to an actress who could have given the main character a bit more depth. All the other actors are fantastic."
5,Happy birthday Samantha!,"This book is great!!!! I had these when I was younger but during hurricane Sandy I lost them all, it's great to know she can get them"
5,GREAT ROCK AND ROLL,"DAVIE ALLAN IS A LEGEND AMONG MUSICIANS. HE'S BEEN AROUND FOREVER AND HAS NEVER GOTTEN HIS DUE. HE PLAYS GREAT GUITAR, WITH A LOT OF FUZZ, FEEDBACK, AND EFFECTS. THIS IS A GREAT CD AND IT'S NOT EVEN ONE OF HIS TOP RECORDS. BUT I GUARANTEE YOU WILL LOVE THIS CD IF YOU LIKE TO LISTEN TO SOMEONE WHO KNOWS HOW TO PLAY ROCK AND ROLL GUITAR. THEN YOU NEED TO GET THIS OTHER STUFF, MY FAVORITE ONE IS A CD CALLED ""FUZZ FEST""."
1,Weakest Album To Date,"Simply put, this is Monster Magnet's weakest album to date. The songs don't stand up to anything that came before it. If you are new to Monster Magnet get any of their earlier albums and leave this one on the shelf."
5,"Smart, literate, sexy mystery novel.","Normally I hate mystery novels -- mostly because their authors draw character too crudely and exaggerate for emphasis. But this novel is different. Like Donna Tartt's ""The Secret History,"" it's a mystery driven by character rather than plot -- yet the mystery is still so gripping that you can't put it down. Although the central events of the story are pretty simple, I'm rereading it now because the story -- though much more plausible than most mysteries -- remains elusive.Another book I would compare it to is Susanna Moore's ""In the Cut."" Like that book, it has sensationalistic elements, but like ""In the Cut,"" it treats these elements with intelligence and detachment.Finally, it also reminded me of Kathryn Harrison's ""Exposure"" in its experimentation with a painful narrative about obsession from different ""sources"", including clinical reports, news stories, and other ""official"" sources."
3,The things you do for love,"I liked the way this book was written and read it in one sitting. Ms. Shute is a very talented writer. The book is a classic case of a woman who loves too much, even though the main character isn't sure that she loves her ""pick-up"". The one thing that bothered me about the ""crime"" was that she had only taken one lesson in self defense and yet she was able to do so much damage. And why didn't he fight back? I guess the author was able to gloss over this by having the character not remember the incident. All this aside, I would recommend this book for a few hours of entertainment.incident."
2,A big disappointment after Brothers and Sisters,"This was my book club's May selection and I must say we were all disappointed. No one got the impression that Bebe put much effort into the book...A comment was made about the image that comes to mind when you think of an author in the process of writing a book; the image is filled with the sound of typing and crumpled pages littering the floor, no one in the Soul Passages book club thought Bebe had any litter.For the most part we liked the main characters but the story wasn't worth telling."
1,Waste,"This book is a waste of time and money. This book is predictable and unimaginative. Campbell is a talented writer, but this book was major disappointment. The book was so terrible, I couldn't finish it."
3,Much coffee needed,"I consider myself a quick reader, and I always read a book until it ends. It took me a little over a year to read this book."
1,"Underdeveloped -Women of Color Book Club, Oct 26,01","Not a page turner, Didn't develope the charcter enough.. Words on the page just layed their sounding dull like a couch potato. To many filler. We did enjoyed the parts when she discussed Maxine relationship with her husband Sachtel. But the story didn't go into enough infromation about why he had the affair. None the less the book had several really profound parts."
1,Disappointed,"After 'Your Blues Ain't Like Mine' I was expecting something great from this talented writer. Unfortunately that was not the case. This book was predictable, dull, and could not capture my interest or attention. I, too, had to force myself to finish the book. Maxine's story with her husband, although poignant, was forced and too sugar-sweet. Very unrealistic. The author's desire to have an uplifting ending resulted in a diluted story with an all too familiar ""give-back-to-the-community-message"" that drowns out the REAL story in this novel."
2,Boring And Predictable,"This story was corny, and the ending was predictable. Please Bee Bee, a little more suspence, better dialouge, and surprising plot twists. Through in some emotional depth, and you've got a winner. It's a far cry from ""Your Blues Ain't Like Mine""."
1,"The author missed the ""real"" story","I am a huge fan of Ms. Campbell's writing, however, I felt this book lacked the honesty her other books are known for. The entertainment industry is pretty shallow and the author's portrayal of was a bit banal and recycled from other books on the same subject. I had a lot of problems with the dialogue which was pretty flat; and the characters were annoyingly uninteresting. The ""real"" story is Maxine's marriage crumbling from her husband's infidelity. I feel that story alone would have made an excellent book, which I am positive the author would know how to handle honestly (just leave that cliche ""miscarriage"" motive out). I'm still a fan and will continue reading Ms. Campbell's work."
2,SLEEPER!,"I have to agree with many of the other reviews out there on this one. It is definately a sleeper not a keeper. It starts out good, but then it just sort of goes nowhere. I am deeply disappointed after reading Brothers and Sisters. Maxine's grandmother was getting on my nerves and it was almost tiring to wait for her to come to her senses. While it wasn't, by far, the worst I have read, it is nothing that I would recommend."
4,Heart for music shines,"This is the first novel I've read from Bebe Campbell and, once I read the first page, I never put it down. The undercurrent throughout the entire book that kept me connected was the love of, and transforming power of, music. Admittedly simplistic, I do believe the power of music can heal everything from a broken heart to a broken neighborhood."
4,Singing In The Comeback Choir,"The writing was beautifully simple, the plot realistic and unique. Here's to intelligent Black fiction!"
4,An excellent and fast read,I tend to read more thriller and suspense. Once in a while I change over for a little more depth. This was not too involved but gave me a real nice lift. I was quite impressed. Bebe's book are all great so far. Thank you Bebe...
2,Toooooooooooooooooo Slow,I've read one other book by Bebe that I enjoyed but I found this book very hard to read. I found myself falling to sleep each time I picked up the book. I enjoyed the strong bond that Maxine shared with her Grandmother. Toward the end I felt that Lindy would never try to come back. But when she did I was glad. I haven't recommened this one. I hope that the next one keep my attention. Be Blessed!
5,Wow!!,I thoroughly enjoyed reading this book; especially the depiction of the lead female character as a strong black woman with close family ties.
5,Nice & Calm,I truly enjoy Mrs. Bebe Moore Campbell's writings. This book provided a nice and calm read verses all of the other confusion that's out there. Thanks Mrs. Campbell for reserving your place in a class by itself.
2,NOT VERY REALISTIC.,I HAVE READ BEBE'S OTHER NOVELS GREATLY WRITTEN I JUST COULD NOT GET INTO THIS BOOK MAXINE WAS NOT PORTRAYING A VERY REALISTIC ROLL I DID NOT LIKE THE FACT THAT SHE WAS TRYING TO FORGIVE HER HUSBAND BUT NOT REALLY FORGIVEN HIM (FOR HIS INFIDELITY) OR HER TRYING TO HELP HER DRUNK GRANDMA COME ON SHE WAS NOT SUPERWOMAN AND BEBE COULD NOT MAKE UP HER MIND EITHER SHE WANTED HER TO BE SUPERWOMAN OR SHE DIDN'T NOT INTERESTING AT ALL.
4,I hear you loud and clear in the comeback choir.,"I loved the story of Maxine and Satchel struggling to regain the intimacy they had lost because of his infidelity. I loved the touches Ms. Campbell used to have Maxine talk to her private parts. I also enjoyed the relationship of Maxine and her grandmother Lindy, a well-known singer. Ms. Campbell's message of its ""never too late"", applied to her marriage, her old community and her grandmother's singing career. A great read."
1,What happend?,"Wow what a shock...this was really bad! Everyone hated this book and literally had to force themselves through the entire book...it was just simply BORING!!! I hope the BeBe who wrote ""Brothers & Sisters"" ""Your Blues Ain't like Mine"" please write another book...I know you can write better than this."
2,I WAS DISAPPOINTED.,I found that this book did start slow as others who reviewed it have said. I was very disappointed by the predictability of the storyline and the rush for the PICTURE PERFECT HAPPY ENDING. Ugh! The relationships were not quite believable or superficial.
3,Campbell can be an inspiration with her poetic insights,"I found it difficult to get interested in this novel, but eventually, I became aware of what the author was attempting -- this happened as a result of reading through a rather laconic beginning to get to know the novel's central characters and actually caring about their destinies. The miracles that Maxine works are a bit too incredulous, but nonetheless desirable. If only life's many problems were as promptly solved!However, the emphasis on humanity made this book a winner. Our money and power driven society really needs the passion for humanity that Campbell's characters possess. Bless her for it."
4,1GB MuVo Tx FM,"I bought this a year back. And I would have rated this as 5, 2 months back. I really liked all the features and most important convenience to be used as a USB drive.

Songs in wma format and MP3 at 96 kbps are still playing well.I am upadting this review as I got it play MP3 songs as well after I changed the firmware."
4,Good product with very poor microphone capability,"The product is great: small, compact, workable. But the recording quality is very mediocre! I bought it mainly for the ability to record sound, but was extremely disappointed. I found it useless for voice recording, especially if the distance is further than 1 yard from the built-in microphone. The voice sound quality is soft, hissy and poor. Eventually I gave up and gave it to my daughter. It's good for pre-recorded music and radio reception."
4,My son is very happy with it.,"Works well, not problems with downloading. No cords, just plugs in.Works great."
4,Muvo TX,"I am happy with the Muvo TX 1GB MP3 Player. It works well, easy to download the MP3 files into it. I agree with other reviewers that the battery cover is quite flimsy. The only other trouble I have had is quicky moving to the other folders and getting everything to work, but that could be my fault since I really haven't taken that much time to use it for anything else besides what I purchased it for and that is to listen to podcasts at work. I hooked it up to little speakers and it works great for that purpose. I would recommend it."
4,"Great mapping software, but it requires too much memory","Wow. This is software is amazingly detailed and simplistic to use. The problem is, you can't use very much of it if you are an eTrex Legend user. The Legend only comes with 8mb of memory and just a couple of counties in Colorado can consume that much memory.Had I known these maps would take up so much memory I would have opted for a different eTrex to one that was expandable.I will say however, that this map is right on with detail and street maps. I was amazed at how much information this map has like local ponds, lakes, shopping centers etc.Really sweet program, just not as efficient for my Legend as I would have hoped."
4,"Generally good, but updates lack new roads","Overall, I like this software because the layout and distances seem accurate, but it lacks major roads that have been around for over 7 years in my area. The ""update"" downloads don't seem to correct those gaps. Also, some street names are old or generic, like ""Co Hwy E2"" instead of the street's long-standing popular name. Sometimes mouse-hover names differ from (or supplement) displayed names on the map.We can't expect Garmin to keep up with ALL new roads created by runaway population growth, but they shouldn't be 7+ years behind reality. I often have to correct MapSource with online maps and Garmin should offer free updates with new roads if the downloads wouldn't be too large."
3,TMI,"Too Much Information! The product does what it is designed to do, and does it well. The problem is that the map sets take up an astronomical amount of memory! I cannot fit all of the Washington, DC Beltway within the 8MB of my Etrex Legend!!! Nor can I map from the DC area to the Outer Banks of North Carolina. Perhaps if Garmin could make the map chunks considerably smaller... Or maybe another product which provides auto-routing with restaurant, lodging and gas info just along the major roadways."
2,Amazon Sells Only Old MetroGuide North America Version 7 from 2005,"Although Amazon advertises MapSource MetroGuide North America v8 DVD (2006), they only have MapSource MetroGuide North America v7 DVD (old 2005). Unless you want to buy a 2 year old set of maps purchase this product from another vendor!"
2,Check the rebate - it's only an upgrade refund.,"Check the rebate. To get it you must have purchased a previous version of the software. This is not a rebate at all, it's an upgrade refund. This is not clear on Amazon's front page - you have to drill into the rebate link to learn this. The price is higher than you think!"
4,Garmin MetroGuide for GPS,"Downloading is fairly basic once the disparate instructions are pulled together. New maps work about as expected, but use near boundaries of original base map versus downloaded detail is awkward. When leaving detail area, the base area is blank until actually entered, i.e., up to half the screen is blank."
3,Street numbers backwards!,"I only used maps one time. While in Gatlinburg, TN, I used my Etrex (loaded with MetroGuide). On the map of the street where my motel was located, the street numbers were backwards. The blocks were in the right order, but a store that I was looking for was located at the wrong end of the block! Guess that's one for the updates!"
4,Good details,"Nice map package to go with my Garmin GPS. The files are awfully large, so I found myself severely limited as to what I could load on the GPS. The maps seem to be quite up-to-date, and the PC interface is pretty good."
1,No Montreal Metro Stations!,"Got this for a recent trip to Montreal, Canada, and was shocked and amazed to discover that the map does NOT include **ANY** Montreal Metro stations! Weirdly, the surface AMT railway stations are included, but to get around downtown on foot, you really need the Metro stations so this map is useless if you plan to use your Garmin device to get around Montreal without a car.Total waste of money in my case."
4,Good way to organize your waypoints and routes!,I am using it to upload waypoints and routes to my (Garmin eTrex Vista) and I found it to be very easy to use and does the job! I certainly recommend it for those who own eTrex Vista ...!
4,I highly Recommend,"I often hear people talk about books they couldn't put down. Although I have experienced such books; I have to say that it's been a while. I think you know where I'm going here, so I'll suffice to say that I was so riveted that this compulsive highlighter hasn't marked a single sentence because I felt slowing down would distract me from absorbing the content of this incredible book! You may want to ask; why ""4 stars"" then? The answer is that I think this content may not be for everyone because it requires a willingness to examine our sacred cows. I am willing, and have benefited greatly because it helped me to see all that we do in the name of The Lord in a different light! Well Done:)"
5,Gieseking and Ravel...a perfect match!,Walter Gieseking has been considered for many years to be thesupreme interpreter of the Frenchimpressionists Debussy and Ravel.This recording does nothing to diminish this reputation. No pianist had the dynamic control and the supreme command of pedaling and half pedaling effects as didGieseking. While there may be sometechnical lapses here and there this is music making of the highestquality. Especially notable arehis performances of the Pavanne andthe Gaspard de la Nuit. I highlyrecommend this album.
3,Time to move on,"Gieseking has served us well in both his ravel and debussy for the past 50 yrs. Its time to move on. ...To Casadesus? No, definetly not his over-rated recordings. Gieseking indeed captured some magic of these 2 french masters, but in comparison with other recent recordings, its time we give Gieseking his place in high honors but not above a few modern frenhmen.I would highly recommend in my order: Bavouzet, Tharaud, Roge, Rouvier.Gieseking articulates well, but his mannerisms are apparent at times, and stick out like a ""sore thumb"".These frenchmen seem to approach as neutral as possible. Gieseking was too much trained in the romantic style to give these modern french poetic masterpieces their fair color and phrasing.Although at the time, we all thought the world of Gieseking, we now listen better.Besides the recording quality on EMI is very poor."
3,Great visual style,"That's what drew me to this book in the first place: an ethereal, evocative visual style. The art renders figures well, in a shifting fogscape that conceals far more than it reveals.That's about it, though. The story? Some kind of heaven vs. hell thing, apparently with some independents trying for form their own army. I never quite got the hang of it. But, even with a vague plot, vivid visual storytelling can still pull me along. Not this time, though. Poses tend towards the static, and the predominance of panels with just one character limit the chances for interaction.It's graphic, for sure, and has plenty of novelty, but it takes more to make a graphic novel that I'd want to keep.-- wiredweirdPS: This reviews the non-special edition, which Amazon does not list as of this writing."
5,Great read!,"If you want to get the feel of what living in Mexico is really like, this book is for you! Very entertaining and amusing! I lived in Mexico full time for 6 years and I guarantee this book tells it like it is. A must read for anyone thinking of retiring south of the border. Sometimes you aren't sure whether to laugh or cry!"
5,This is TIGHT!,"If you are able to get this CD GET IT! KDM'S GROOVE is a real tight track. Every time I feel like chillin' I pump it as loud as I can. Don't be with me when I am going to a football or basketball game because that's the track that get's me Hype, you will hear it AAAAALLLL night long. Keep bringing it right K. Dwayne. PEACE."
5,A Song for My God (Latin Groove) Track #3,"This whole CD is the BOMB! Especially when I heard the spanish song. WOOOO-WEEEE. I am glad I was able to get a copy of the pre-release. Kevin you are a very versatile and awesome composer my brother. This CD will keep you guessing. Usually after you hear the first song of a CD you can tell where the rest of it is going. Well, not on this one."
5,Real Smooth,The music on this CD really flows. It truly is impossible to put an age limit on this project. You can't even give it a specific genre. It covers the entire spectrum of music.
4,Looks like its may get completed...someday,"Stories have it that the author broke her arm or wrist not long after the second book in this series was published. Then her mother passed away. She has supposedly finished something, but it is not the Captal's Tower. Hints indicate that this book might her next project. http://www.melanierawn.com/"
1,Very Disappointed,"I must say that I am extremely disappointed at how long been taking for this book to get written. I got hooked on the first two books years ago and I have been waiting YEARS for this bloody book! I have seen that Ms Rawn has come out with a new book but where is the third book in this series?! I have pretty much given up on the third book ever coming out and I haven't even picked up the previous two in over two years for fear that I will once again be duped into thinking that maybe this year the book will come out. Thankfully, I have books by more dedicated authors that acutally keep their fans in mind while they're writing."
1,There's not a rating low enough,"I'm sorry, she is a good writer, but not good enough to wait 10 years between the 2nd in a trilogy and the end. Unbelieveable that she thinks so little of her readers as to leave them hanging so long. I will NOT be recommending her to anyone else, and I will not buy another book of hers. As far as being told not to complain, I think we are entitled to since she wouldn't be anywhere without her fan base, and apparently she thinks very little of it."
3,Ify,I have read some of yalls reviews. I loved the series I was kinda upset with the 16 year time jump from the first to the second book but I finally got into it. I love who the new Captal is and I have been waiting for the next book The Captal's Tower. I feel that she is going to explain more in the ways of the Captal and how the Captal is to learn and explor all the magic at her disposal. I have been waiting for this book for over 3 years. I have all these books in hardback because I buy them as soon as they come out. I will be a loyal fan of this series but she needs to get her act in gear. Now that being said I also believe that some authors need a break becaue we really dont want them getting burned out on writing our favorite series.Loyal FanGreat series
1,Nebraska Grandma,"My paperback copy of Mageborn Traitor was published March 1998. Several times a year i have searched for Ms Rawn's 3rd book in her series between her and George RR Martin i have almost become computor literate. My concern is that i may die of old age before it is either finished or has finally become available in the U.S. I do not doubt part of the hold up is $$$.00. Thank goodness Geo. RR finally came through tho there is to be ""another"" book after his last on because it was too long. Yeh, right once again $$$$$.00. I am now searching for good thick books that have already been published in paper back."
4,blue collar Mack review,"I have been a blues, jazz and blues rock fan all of my life. I don't know much about reviews but I know what I like in music and this piece of work is one that I would spend my money on. This is my kind of music to work to. There is too much country in it for a top rating but not enough to hurt it. I really enjoy this cd."
1,Taken for a ride? You will be,"In my collection which spans who knows 3,000 odd cds singles and lps I have the misfortune to own the origional issue LP of this.Don't be fooled like I was. I bought my copy off the back of an NME review before hearing it. Without doubt the worst piece of ""music"" my possesion.It is not a post punk highlight it is a cacophony, imagine a bunch of drunk Greenham common peace protesters having a sing along after 15 pints of special brew and you are getting close to how bad this is. It is not ground breaking it's just dreadful.For some reason Kurt Cobain gave this a name check and it has now become some kind of icon.Really it really really is bad. Avoid!"
3,Uneven but Charming,"Unlike other reviews, I recognize the debut of respected character actor John Hawkes (Deadwood, From Dusk 'Till Dawn) as the male lead here. Not at all a stellar work, at least it's well shot and edited. Good views of Austin in the late '80's and performance by Alejandro Escovedo's great band True Believers. Not to mention a soundtrack by the unheralded Robert Renfrow."
3,First rate slow paced account,"A first person account of a guy looking to explore his long-surpressed desire to submit to other men and their desires to beat, spank, and torture their partners. Not as explicit as I would like, not as much of a ""page turner"" as I would like, but some first rate passages, and a likeable, realistic, where-is-he-whne-i-need-him protagonist."
2,Not bad but breaks easily,I got this for my girlfriend's phone. She loves the zebra pattern but the case seems cheaply made. It already is starting to fit loosely and has a small chip on one of the corners. You would think the case would at least stay strong for a couple of months!
4,Pretty nice,"I bought this about 7 months ago, the very same case by Eforcity, but it was selling for only a penny. It has lasted me a very good while to be so dirt cheap! It didnt start chipping until the very end, and then the prongs that secure it to the phone started breaking off one by one. I finally discarded it after reaching into my pocket and having the sensation that my phone bit the crap out of me because the side of the cover split and a very pointy shard stabbed my finger. Ouch. =[ Even after all of that, I still give this item 4 stars for it lasting that long with VERY heavy use. It has survived two razr phones, which are crappy, we all need to upgrade anyway!"
2,The sound is great,"In the Subaru WRX, it loses power.With this valve in place to measure dynamometer and the car slowed.Do not know why?We put a GFB valve and gained more horsepower"
3,Quality of Toner,"The Ricoh Toner 400759 toner I received is not performing as well as expected. The print toner is not printing with the correct amount of ink and contrast which it should do, as it is a manufacturer product. Consequently the documents are printed in 'dark grey' not black (it does not seem to be the printer setting, the previous toner was 'inking' well) The price was so much less than other office supply options. So, you get what you pay for.In the future, I would not order this toner through this distributor but work with something more direct such as my local office supplies store or OfficeMax. As this was shipped via us postal service (took 2 weeks after order for receipt) and not purchased more locally, returning as an RMA without having a replacement in house is not feasible. We would be without a printer for another 2 weeks."
3,A Classic,"This DTP software is a classic. It is mature and stable. For long documents like books or manuals it is a good choice. It may be a little too mature, though. The underlying technology is 16-bit code that does not take advantage of today's modern operating systems. The user interface looks like something coming from the 1980s. In the book publishing market there is not much of a competition, so Adobe may think they could get away with this. But they can't really. Compare Corel's Ventura Publisher 8. It is also an excellent choice for books and long structured documents. It is based on up-to-date 32-bit technology and a the printing engine from Corel Draw. The modern user interface is very similar to the recent versions of Corel Draw. So, Adobe needs to do more than they did for this Upgrade to keep Framemaker competitive, esp. they when they charge that much money for it."
1,A PhD?,"How does one get a doctorate and not know how to write? The grammer is abysmal, the inaccuracies are glaring and the editing is atrocious. It get's pretty bad at the description of the religions of ancient Egypt. Dr. Monroe spends a who page describing embalming and King Tut's tomb. This is a book about religion. There's got to be something better."
1,inaccurate and sometimes contradictory,"This book, which claims to be an introduction to the world's religions,spends 2/3 of its time discussing the development of Christianity. Even if the potential reader is a non-Christian or a Christian who seeks to rationalize Christianity with reason, this book has many errors and off-the-wall remarks which are misleading. For the Christian who basically holds to all the truth of the Bible, you are much better off consulting other books for knowledge about the other religions of the world."
4,Robert Taylor Deserved More,"Robert Taylor: The Man With the Perfect Face is a book that tells of Taylor's life, and it does a decent job. It published just four years after his death in 1969, and the author, Ms. Wayne, was able to meet him, so that lends credibility to her biography of this Hollywood heartthrob.But the book doesn't go deep enough. It reads like a compilation of data, with little life added in. It paints Robert Taylor as almost a ""goody two shoes.""Yet there was more to him, & I for one hope to read a book that uncovers and tells the truth about many other factions of his life. He WAS a good, solid family man. He had no shocking secrets. Yet he DID harbor demons, and this is the story Ms. Wayne should've told."
2,I couldn't even finish it,"The ""A Time to. . . "" series was tolerable up to this point. The first two books were decently enjoyable, the next two were tolerable, but ""A Time to Love"" and ""A Time to Hate"" were terrible. These books just repeated themselves, and I couldn't even get through the first 50 pages of ""A Time to Hate."" Picard seemed bored throughout the book, and so was I."
3,Weak but OK,"""Hate"" continues the weak story from ""Love."" It is an ok book and a good time killer. If you expect to be moved or thrilled this is not the book for it. We do get to see more of Kyle Riker and the purposal of marriage between Riker and Troi, but the book is lacking. The relationship between Seer and Riker is likely the most interesting part of the novel, but some of the other situations seem absurd. Why would Kyle Riker do some of the things he does? The ""sense of guilt"" angle gets old and lame quickly. If you are not a die hard Trek fan....skip it."
4,Good toy,"We've been very happy with this toy. It's a good quality, they are even cuter in person, and they have a good ""feel"" to them. I didn't give it 5 stars only because it's really not a necessity. No one NEEDS 12 little gingerbread guys. But this was the one toy Santa brought our kids and I think it was a good one. We'll pack it away and only get it out at Christmas-time and I think that's good. It's not going to hold their attention (ages 1 and nearly 4 at Christmas this year) for very long, but they've played with it several times. It's safe. It's cute. My 4 year old likes sorting by the different features. I think Santa got a great deal buying when it was on lightening sale for $10 with free shipping. If nothing else, they'll be a cute decoration for years to come. I like decorations that are safe for kids to play with. :)"
4,Not as fun as I thought they would be!,"I thought these would be great in my daycare but they are only used for pretend cookies. We tried playing memory match and it was hard because none really ""match up"".they do have different colors and embelishments but my kids really do not actively play with these, they are a little tough for little hands and fingers to snap together."
4,Judy's voice + Dylan's tunes = great listening,"Judy Collins' clear, clean voice does justice to most of these great Dylan tunes. Her rendition of ""Love Minus Zero"" is a standout. For the most part, as is true with most Dylan songs, the tracks on this album really benefit from someone who can actually SING!The only exception is ""Like A Rolling Stone."" That song's melody and lyrics fit Dylan's vocal style perfectly, and it needs to have his sarcastic, cutting vocal edge in order to be effective. Judy should not have attempted this song. It ends up sounding sweetened and watered down.However, most of the other songs really benefit from this kind of treatment. Overall, a pleasant listen."
5,INDEED COLLINS SINGS * * * *,"Judy sings Dylan, clearer and with much spunk on this recording. Every word rings out on this one. With powerful words and messages by Bob Dylan, Judy lyrically empowers them. I BELIEVE IN YOU and DARK EYES are lovely while the other selections are full of energy. This album is a must if you are either a Collins fan or a Dylan fan."
5,Hyde Carbide Scraper,"The Hyde carbide scraper is well worth the extra money over the carbon metal type scrapers, as it lasts and lasts. Its easy to use and speeds up the work."
2,Disappointed.,"No, I'm not a literary expert but so what? I picked it up based on the positive reviews, but I agree with some of the negative reviews. Jerome Battle's voice was unconvincing. His thought processes were so overly descriptive and loaded with ""special"" words (I'm embarrassed to admit that I actually consulted the dictionary while reading). I just couldn't believe that a guy really thinks this way! Due to the fact that Jerry seemed so unreal, I just couldn't care less about him or the story."
1,Why was this book written?,I often wonder how an author picks a theme to write about. I absolutely have no idea what made Mr. Lee waste so much of his time on such dull characters in a dull setting in a dull story. I didn't care one iota about Jerry Battle and his adult children. There was nothing about this book that moved me in any way. Why did I read it? It was a book club selection. I forced myself to finish it and I can't wait to see what the discussion leader who picked it has to say. I paid $50 to attend the book club meeting. At least I know the food will be good.
1,Boring,"I have never been so bored whilst reading, if this hadn't been our bookclub choice I would never have finished it.If this in anyway is representational of Middle American life I'm glad I'm Australian."
3,Perhaps a bit overly introspective,"I'm a little bit surprised that I kept reading the story of Jerome Battle's perpetual failure to connect with those in his life, because I just did not like this protagonist very much. In fact, Rita, Jerry's former love, is the only character I DID like. Still, Lee has a dizzying command of the English language and his protagonist does offer some unsettling and spot-on insights into aging and American culture. As other reviewers have noted, this novel is a slow start, but it sucked me in. I have not read any other books by Lee, but I am glad I read this one."
2,king of the run-on sentence,"I guess the point of this book is that it's kind of apathetic and just sort of drifts along with no particular direction. Which is all well and good, except that it doesn't make for a very good read. It's sort of boring and annoying. In this book, all the characters are flat, and rather unlikeable. Due to the first-person narrator, we don't even get much of a sense of the other characters; they're just sort of background-noise to the non-story being told. The effect is that we never really feel connected to the story, and don't really care about any of the characters. Also, our first-person narrator has an extreme tendency to ramble in run-on sentences. As a literary technique, I don't mind this too much, but when the character himself is boring, any little quirk in his voice becomes grating."
5,Long time,"Not since McCrae's ""The Bark of the Dogwood"" have I so been affected by a subtle yet powerful novel. But this is exactly what happened with Chang-Rae Lee's ""Aloft."" His third novel, Lee has hit the proverbial nail on the head when it comes to drawing characters. Jerry is the perfect middle-aged man, complete with all the baggage that comes with that territory, and this, accompanied by the other elements that Lee gives us about the family, make for a riveting book."
3,Mixed reactions,"After hearing an interview with Mr. Lee about the book and reading several glowing reviews, I expected to like this novel very much. Instead, I feel conflicted about it. Jerry Battle's voice was not realistic; I was always aware that his words were really those of the erudite wordsmith, Mr. Lee. Hence, I never felt drawn into Battle's life and self - I was always on the outside, being bombarded by Lee's verbiage, convoluted sentences, and professorial vocabulary. Also, the ending was very unrealistic, completely out of character for everyone involved, particularly Eunice. So, I would have to say that as a novel, the book failed. However, as a cultural analysis of American suburbia during the past 50 years, particularly post-1980s, I would have to say it's very good. Would I recommend it? Probably not. Am I glad I read it? Probably so."
2,Characters don't ring true,"After reading A Gesture Life, I expected wonderful character portraits. Instead, I found the portrayals of just about all the characters so artificial and contrived - right down to having the protagonist fly a plane - that the book was almost painful to read. I forced myself to get through about 2/3's of it and then simply could not go any further. Even the Long Island of the book seemed like the view of an outsider, not that of the insider it was supposed to be from. I recommended A Gesture Life to everyone. I would not recommend this book to anyone."
2,Lackluster,I found this book very hard to get into and read. It had potential - and then the author wasted so much time with (for me) insignificant details. I found myself skipping paragraphs and pages to get to the story. I was hoping for more...
4,Kindle edition of Four to Score,"I really love the Stephanie Plum series by Janet Evanovich. A two-week family vacation was the excuse I needed to purchase the series for my new Kindle. I was very disappointed with the quality of the translation for this book. There are mistakes throughout the entire book, most of which are easy to read through. Such as a main character's name misspelled. However, some errors are frustrating and very difficult to decipher. Frequently, short and quick dialogue between two or more characters will be placed in a single paragraph making it impossible for the reader to know who is saying what. Hopefully there will be a corrected version coming in the future and I will be happy to update this review."
2,Too much profanity,"I have read almost all of the Stephanie Plum novels and enjoyed them, but this one just has too much profanity. I found myself trying to scan the paragraphs and just skip over the ones that had all foul language but my eyes kept stumbling over this verbal barbed wire. I understand how she was trying to portray the character of Sally Sweet, but it possible to convey the fact that he is cursing without actually using the profanity. I was very disappointed because the other books weren't so foul. It's a good thing I read them out of order or I probably wouldn't have gotten past 4"
4,Sexy Stephanie,"This is the hottest Stephanie Plum novel so far. As in the rest of her writing, Evanovich skillfully evades cliche even when dealing with sexual tension. Stephanie's mating dance with Joe Morelli is believable to the max, as are the flaws in the relationship. The sudden appearance of the woman who wrecked Stephanie's marriage - as a bounty hunter - does stretch credulity a little, but her interactions with Lula make up for that. Plot? Who cares. It's about the characters. Don't miss this one."
1,"The worst narrator ever- read the paperback, don't listen to the book","This is the only Stephanie Plum audiobook narrated by CJ Critt. She is the worst Stephanie Plum ever. Read this book...don't try to listen to it. The other Stephanie Plum novels are narrated by Lorelei King who is good, or Lori Petty, who is even better."
5,Girlfriend is BACK!,"Okay--let's start by saying the latest installment in the Stephanie Plum series is not the best but it doesn't matter to Stepanie Plum fans. Girlfriend is back and that is all that matters! SP fans have anxiously awaited SP's newest adventures with both bounty hunting and Joe Morrelli. And Ms. Evanovich does not let us down. Weak plot? Yes. Stock villians? Yes. Does it matter? NO! The pace is still fun. The SP's entourage of offbeat characters are sharp and endearing. And smoke between Joe and Stephanie finally goes full afire. What more could one asked for, but be entertained, amused and eager for the next one."
4,Some good laughs,"Man I forgot how entertaining Stephanie Plum can be. She sure can get into some interesting situations and meet some unique individuals. Don't mind reading about Morelli either, yummy. I love the way the story line keeps your interest makes it hard to put the book down! I am hooked on the series again not sure why I stopped before."
4,Revenge,"What do you get when you combine a failure to appear, Stephanie Plum, a gun and the burg? FOUR TO SCORE by Janet Evanovich.Like always, Stephanie is faced with bringing in a person who skipped after bail. Seems like a pretty simple case in the beginning. As she starts tracking the bail jumper, she finds herself trapped in a maze of clues, enemies, extortion, shoot outs, missing limbs, drag queens and a baby. Only Stephanie and her family and friends can make crime funny.FOUR TO SCORE readers have grown accustom to Stephanie Plum's antics when it comes to recovery. I love her entire family, the community and co-workers, not to mention the relationship Stephanie shares with Rex. Each and every book, I find myself laughing and anxious to see if she's getting any closer to setting her life on the right path."
4,Evanovich continues to rock,"Having discovered Evanovich's Stephanie Plum series has made me what to be a bounty hunter. Her fourth book in her series finds Stephanie once again facing disasters, blowing up cars and suffering her mother's ever present disappointment. For those that liked her first three, will continue to discover that if it could happen to anyone it would be Stephanie."
3,"Fun, light reading but not her best",This book was fun but not as good as some of her other Stephanie Plum books. Still an enjoyable read though
2,NOT ONE OF EVANOVICH'S BEST!,"Janet Evanovich still managed to write a funny - but much less so than ""One for the Money""- mystery, but I felt this one had too little mystery story in it and too many hard to believe incidents. The ""shooting"" scene with Sugar was a little funny, but it was just too miraculous an escape even for Stephanie. Also, haven't there been enough car destructions? Time for more plot and fewer harrowing experiences for our heroine. I wonder if the reader from CA noted the use of ""choose"" (twice!) when, I think, ""chose"" was the proper tense? Wondering about Number Five!"
5,Pure Enjoyment,"Just finished Evanovich's fourth book, ""Four to Score"". If you have not read any of her previous books I would encourage you to start with the first one as it sets up her characters and therefore makes each new novel more fun. I loved this book. I sat in a restaurant at lunch time today and 4 people came up and asked me what I was reading. I sat there laughing and smiling for an hour. The book is entertainment at its best. About 8 months after I read one of Evanovich's books I start calling the book store to find out when the next one is due to hit the shelves.Do your self a favor. Buy ""One For The Money"", Two For the Dough"" ""Three to Get Deadly"" and ""Four to Score"". You will THANK YOURSELF."
4,Great book - Disapointing Reader...,"I'm first to admit i'm a fan of the Evanovich series. Having listened to the first three (all read by Lori Petty) I was somewhat disapointed to find that Book four was read by Mazar -- even more so after listening too it. Of course, I could be wrong here, but I don't think its Evonavich who's slipping..."
2,Love Morelli but....,"I was greatly looking forward to this book. I love the Morelli character and just couldn't wait to find out what was going on with him. Still, I was a bit dismayed when the mystery took a back seat to graphic sex. Not that I'm a prude, I just think it should be used _when necessary_ to add to the plot or to give information about characters. The same information could have been conveyed without the ""humping"" scenes. The earlier books were much more about plot and character...and much enjoyable. I hope the next one is better!"
4,"""A Wild And Hysterical Ride!""","Stephanie Plum is the bomb! Wise-cracking, neurotic, headstrong. She doesn't come off as the world's greatest bounty hunter, but through hard work and a couple of breaks she gets the job done. The other characters shine through. Ex-hooker Lula and transvestite rocker Sally Sweet rule! And I love fiesty, gun-wielding Grandma Mazur. Stephanie's parents are a trip throughout this hunt for a bail jumper that winds its way down a path of revenge, murder, explosions and a criminal conspiracy. Vice cop Joe Morelli provides excellent sexual tension. It also appealed to me a lot since I grew up right next door to Trenton, NJ, and could clearly visualize many of the places Evanovich mentioned."
1,not that good.,My sister-in-law is a librarian so she suggested I read Four to Score. It was not good at all. The language in the book turned me off. Surely these books can be written without these words that are offensive. The book was poorly written. The character development was lacking. It did not flow and was hard to read. I will try other Janet Evanovich books and see if they are better. So I give it a lone star.
4,Four stars,"The Stephanie Plum series has definitely kept me coming back for more. Janet Evanovich includes just the right amount of wit, sarcasm, and cynicism in her books to balance out the action, suspense, and romance. She creates unique crimes and the answer at the end is always shocking. Four To Score didn't disappoint.Lula, the 200 lb. ex-hooker who has appointed herself as Stephanie's sidekick, is quickly becoming a...[...]"
3,Left Wanting more but it was funny!,"This is the first one of the Stephine Plum novels that i found myslef actually laughing out loud! it was very funny and mysterious!Stephine Plum is on the case of a runaway waitress who stole her boyfriends car. in this book Ex-Hooker Lula, Joe Morelli and a drag queen who calls himself ""Sally Sweet."" there are dead bodys, people missing fingers and firebombs.even though it was a very funny book, i found myslef not liking somepoints in the book :("
4,"Stephanie and Joe finally do the ""dirty deed""!!!","Well, this is not the best of the four, but it is still entertaining, funny and a quick read.I loved the new characters, happy that Rex didn't die and could feel the passion finally ignite BIG time between Joe and Steph.Unfortunately, I also found two typos, that I hope are corrected in future editions: dessert is spelled ""desert"" in one place and on another page there is a period instead of a comma or visa versa. Not being nit-picky...I am a writer so I tend to notice these things!Good, light, entertaining summer read."
4,Watch out Kinsey...She's gonna gitcha!,Stephie just gets better and better. This character is growing into a person that I'd like to know personally. Ms. Evanovich has got a knack that make her heroine more human than either Kinsey or the ever whining Kay Scarpetta. Excuse me...DOCTOR Kay Scarpetta. I hope that Stephanie will eventually travel out of Trenton and see a bit more of the surrounding world. This book refines Stephanie Plum. That's it. Ross Homer
3,"Good, but not the best of the four!","I read all four of Evanovich's books at once, starting with the first and progressing through - not the best one - but Stephanie and Joe do finally get together!"
4,Four is a Winner,"Four to Score is a winner in the Stephanie Plum series. It's fast-paced, funny and believable in a strange way. In this book, Stephanie is trying to collar a waitress who jumped bail after she was arrested for stealing her boyfriend's car. Sounds simple doesn't it? Well, not in Stephanie's world! She finds herself in all kinds of trouble, and without a car and a home because of fallout from this case. But in true Stephanie fashion she seems to come out on top. She meets a new friend - a six foot four inch drag queen called Sally Sweet (boy I hope we see more of him in the future), and she actually takes her so-called relationship with Morelli to another level. This is my favourite Plum so far."
3,FOUR SCORES LOW FOR ME!!!!!!,"I have read these book in order and I think I gave the first three a five rating. ""Four"" has all the great characters of the first three plus two newcomers. Namely, Sally Sweet and Sugar. I hope Sally Sweet is back again. He added a great deal of humor to the book. This is a very good mystery that will hold your attention until the last for the surprise ending. These books are fun to read and you will find your self laughing out loud in many places. I really like Stephanie, Joe, Lula and Ranger. Also, Grandma is always good for a laugh. Why did I give it a three??? Because of the sex part in this one. I know this is just me, but, the first three played about with sex with thoughts and a few words. This book got very descriptive with it which I did not like. To each his or her own and it won't matter to Evanovich at all but just my openion."
3,Four to Score (Audio and Abridged),"I first listened to the audio version of this Janet Evanovich book and was disappointed. The reader speaks too fast and the story was moving too quickly. The story lasts only three hours and I found myself getting stuck on the readers accent and quick reading. Characters were lost in the audio version, LuLu sounded like GrandMa and Morelli sounded like Ranger. I stopped listening after the third side and decided to read the book. I'm so glad I did. So, do yourself a favor and read, don't listen."
3,Disappointed,"We have read her earlier books and enjoyed them, and were looking forwards to reading ""four to Score"". However when we did, we found that the OVERUSE of swearing,reliance on ""characters"" and possibly too much sex got in the way of the action (not talking about the sex! )We do like a good going story and sadly this was not."
1,MISPRINT,"Be careful before buying this book. I bought this bought and it was a ""misprint"" it included about 35 pages of another book right in the middle of this book. I contacted the author and I am very sad to say that her daughter was less than helpful. I explained the situation numerous times and the fact that I own about 13 of her books...but to no avail. I explained that I am in the process of gathering quite a nice library of HARDCOVER books and I would like to have a new one and I would ship her the misprinted one. She said that she had NONE....come on ...I was born on a day....just not yesterday. She told me via email that she couldn't get a hardcover (yet Amazon and ebay clearly have them) so she would have to go out to the bookstore and buy one....a paperback of course.I love the writing ....but the business practices force me and my friends to stop buying any of her books. I offered to send the book back first so it could be examined...but to no avail..."
3,Disappointing Sequel,"I had waited impatiently for my best-loved author's latest installment in the Stephanie Plum series. As a longtime Evanovich fan, I was sorely disappointed with Four To Score, in which the author seems to have lost her voice. The characters are flat and the dialogue wooden. Compared to the first three Stephanie Plum books, which were laugh-out-loud hilarious, this installment seems to be trying too hard to coast on the cast's momentum. The BIG suspense was too easy to see coming. I hope for a return to the ""real"" Stephanie, Lula, and Grandma Mazur in future books."
3,"Good, but just not as good as the others","I'm a big fan of Janet Evanovich's books- however Four To Score just wasn't as good in my opinion as the others. While I know that technically this book series is marketed and classified as 'Crime', it doesn't and never has struck me as a real 'crime' series. It's more of a Chick-Lit/Action genre, which I like better than crime. I actually found this book to be more violent than her others- something I didn't particularly like that much. Also, like others have also wrote, I did get a little frustrated at the fact that sometimes you wonder how someone can lack some common sense, i.e being leaving her gun in her cookie jar all the time, or leaving it in her pocketbook and fogetting to take her pocketbook with her, etc. However, it's still an OK read and I'd still reccommend it."
3,Good read,Not the best Evanovich but pleasant reading and same enjoyable cast of characters. A light mystery with some funny moments.
3,Good story--HORRIBLE EDITING on Kindle,"For whatever reason, the Kindle version of this book is riddled with errors---spelling, punctuation and wrong names. Some chapters have multiple paragraphs (dialogue between characters) all morphed into one, while others have paragraph indents in the middle of a sentence. I am hoping I can return this because it's distracting, ridiculous, and simply should be right.Great story though, I love the Stephanie Plums."
5,Evanovich's Plum Novels,Stephanie Plum is a great read. By the time you see this review I will have read all 10 of her books & am looking forward to more.A lite & easy read that will keep you entertained till the end.
3,Annoying,"I had never read an Evanovich 'Stephanie Plumb' novel before. I got this audiobook at the library and gave it a try. The narration gave Stephanie an annoying personality, not tough, not feminine, just annoying. The Sugar plotline was boring and went nowhere and the book would have been better without it. Maybe it was the narrator, CJ mazur or someone, but I didn't like Stephanie. I have to like the protagonist or I don't enjoy mysteries."
4,I can't stop now,"I bought # 1 while on vacation because I had a couple of friends that said they've enjoyed the series. I thought I'd buy 1, maybe 2 but I'm hooked. It's a fast read & keeps me coming back for more."
4,Entertaining Series,These books are very cleverly written and entertaining. In my opinion they are too short resulting in being a bit pricey if you order all 19.
5,More Fun in the Garden State,"Once again Janet Evanovich has created some truly bizarre characters, including a heterosexual transvestite and someone who is cutting the fingers off people who might know something about a waitress who borrowed her scummy boyfriend's car just when he was feeling grouchy enough to file charges. The belly laughs and nervous sexual arousal continue. Then the firebombing starts. Hold on to whatever you got, this one is good."
4,Read it pool side,"I bought this book in spain (it was the only available book in English) and didn't expect much - but it was really cute. Stephanie Plum is a sort of rough around the edges Jersey version of Bridget Jones. And the mysteries are pretty good too - and I'm really not a mystery reader. I would recomend this book as a great pool-side read - you really don't need to pay a whole lot of attention, the characters are laugh out loud funny, and there's enough sexual tension to keep it fresh."
3,Silly fun for Stephanie,"Once again, Stephanie has car trouble, man trouble, and even apartment trouble. This one got too silly for me. Ms Evanovich got caught up in the laughs so much, she forgot to put in the mystery. If you are depressed, you might enjoy this. It's fast and entertaining. I figured out the firebomber way too early. At the end, I didn't even care much about the person Stephanie was pursuing. I did like the way Steph's friends and family harassed her about the ""glow"" in her face."
4,Evanovich Has A First Class Imagination!,"In this installment, Stephanie Plum is tracking a waitress named Maxine Nowicki who is wanted for taking her boyfriend's car for a joy ride. Maxine jumps bail and Stephanie gets the green light to chase her. With reformed prostitute Lula and cross dressing Sally Sweet in tow, Stephanie stumbles onto a tangled plot that involves a counterfeit money production scam. Also in this novel, Stephanie FINALLY has sex with the luscious Joe Morelli. YAY! But even her sex life is a disaster. When the 'Burg finds out Stephanie is living with Joe because someone set fire to her apartment, people start annoucing their wedding and that Stephanie is pregnant!How Evanovich does it, I don't know and I don't care. As long as she keeps on creating these wacky and loveable characters, I will be a dedicated reader. Totally hilarious and a ton of fun, I highly recommend this novel."
5,"Easily as good as any ""cozy"" by Carolyn Hart or Sue Grafton.","Anyone who lives in a big city in the Northeast will enjoy the characters and neighborhoods described in this book. As Stephanie tries to find and bring back a bail jumper, you follow her through Trenton, NJ streets and down to the shore. The people are like people I know. I have read and enjoyed the first 3 of Ms. Evanovich's books. I find myself going slowly with this one because I don't want to lose touch with the characters. There are enough plot lines to keep anyone interested, if the characters aren't enough. But Stephanie's trials and tribulations keep me turning the pages."
4,"Cute, I'd definately read more by Kristen Kemp","I picked up THE DATING DIARIES at the library a few days ago, and I really liked it.THE DATING DIARIES is all about Katie James (or Jaymes, which is how her way out there mother likes to spell it). A few days ago, Katie's boyfriend of 4 1/2 years decided that he would rather be with a girl that wasn't afraid to do whatever he asked, like Katie was. In all her misery, Katie decides that she'll show Paul (her ex-boyfriend) that she doesn't need him, and The Plan is born.In six weeks, Katie will go on 12 dates - one date every Friday and Saturday night. That way she'll be able to date a bunch of people, and she'll have time to fall in love again before prom!THE DATING DIARIES is cute, but the ending is predictable. I liked most of the characters (Frankie, Blue, and Matt probably being the most memorable), but the beginning was slow. It took about 30 pages to really get interested in the story.Overall grade - B-"
2,Bad Book,"I just finished reading The Dating Diaries. It is about Katie Jaymes who has to find a date for prom by going on 12 dates to get over her ex boyfriend Paul whom she dated for a few years. The book did not go in a good direction, in some parts it was funny but in others it was just stupid. I would not recommed it to anybody."
4,Make sure your read all product details and comments,"The product I ordered was a book,it was in very good condition. There was no problem with the product. Just want to make sure that no one makes the mistake of ordering the wrong book. I needed the student edition of Introductory Algebra, but ordered the teachers edition, because I didn't read all product details and comments. Now I have to order the student edition. Hope that this information will help others in their attempt to place an order."
4,FUN FUN FUN...Got it for 1/2 Price at TRU,"Got the Jurassic Bounce for my 3 boys ages 6, 4, and 2. They have such a great time jumping around and sliding out the back. There is a sound box that groans like a dragon, which is kinda neat also. The only issue we have had is our almost 2 yr old is too short to get in the front himself b/c the head sits so high so I placed a little stool in front to help him in. Sets up quick and easy in about 1 minute. Has a very powerful blower, the material seems very thick and durable. We have left it outside and has been good so far. Just wash it down with a hose get get any dirt out of it. We were going to get a Little Tikes but saw this dragon on clearance for 1/2 price which was a great bargain!"
3,very nice and cute,The watch is sleek and classy but I have one problem with it.My wrist is quite thin and as a result this does not fit properly and I had to go to the store to adjust the length.Otherwise I am very happy with kenneth cole products and this watch is also quite impressive.
5,The Ceramics Bible,"This is a tour-de-force textbook that covers the fundamental science behind ceramics and glass. And to the extent that the same energy equations (for kinetics, thermodynamics, stress and strain, defects, light transmission, grain boundaries, etc) apply to other inorganic materials, this book is an understandable reference for them too. It was the bible at MIT for Ceramics Mat Sci BS and MS students. Well indexed, a usable teaching and reference book."
4,Too Much Talking Inside the Head,"A good trilogy with very interesting mix of characters. However, characters talk too much to their (other)-selves, and that gets annoying after 500 pages. And, that (thing) happened to reborn is just plain stupid. Oh well... a good read none-the-less if you could withstand some disappointments in the storyline."
3,Average at Best,...It is difficult to get interested in a story when you don't give a damn what happens to the characters. Additionally the story line seems fragmented and it is difficult to figure out who is talking and why sometimes.Anyway so far this trilogy barely makes a 3 star and while I will probably read VENGEANCE OF DRAGONS it had better improve quickly of that will be the end for me.I give this book a NETURAL RECOMMENDATION.
3,"Good book, for a fantasy book","I bought this book, by accident actually, but I didn't regret. I did enjoy reading it and was impressed by the not-too-obvious characters. Still, Diplomacy of Wolves, did not stand out from the other fantasy books. It's impossible to find a fantacy book, which would really differ from all these ""save the world""-stories. But if you want to have a good sleep-time book and are fond of fantasy books, I would recommend Diplomacy of Wolves."
5,A Gripping Book,"Fascinating world, interesting heroine and hero with a curse, deadly family rivalry, quest for a magic item, chase across the world... what more can you hope for from a fantasy book. Holly Lisle has done it again. I had to get book 2 right away. This story gets dark, though, so it is not for everyone's taste."
5,One of the best books I've ever read......,"Tantilising....magicial....this book is more than a simple run-of-the-mill book. Holly Lisle had done a WONDERFUL job with The Secret Texts. She is one of the best authors out there. Id recomend this book for anyone over 12. Though many younger kids could read it, there's some stuff they don't really need to read."
3,"So, so...","In a few words, this book makes for interesting bedtime reading. The world and characters are intriguing -although I found the main character's love interest the most believable- and the dark atmosphere turns a potentially typical, PG fantasy into a slightly more mature novel. This is probably the most unique trait of Lisle's otherwise unremarkable writing. Her plot leaves much to be desired as she drags on the story senselessly at times, and at others, employs plot devices (e.g. two souls/one body) overmuch. Her style of prose isn't itself a draw, as with other authors, much to my disappointment.Overall, I would recommend for a quick read -along with the next two, as this is definitely no standalone- for those looking for atypical fantasy, not a masterpiece. Also, as others have noted, this is not for the squeamish."
3,Mary-Sue...or is it Kait?,"This book has elements that make a great story; plots & betrayal, ancient magic, ancient curses and so on. I found it very enjoyable, however it was marred slightly by Mary-Sue characteristics that Kait has. She's luscious, fully-bodied, sexual, beatiful and enchants everyman who meets her (literally) except when he knows her dark secret. She's also extremely talented in diplomacy and a natural at magic - and her deep dark secret bestows upon her many other skills. In other words, she's more of a wish fullfillment character for the author than one who stands on her own. This mars the book. It could have been great, but is merely good."
5,Holly strikes gold again!,"I actively search out books written by Holly Lisle, and this series does not lack for excitement or story line. From the first page to the last, she keeps you rivited to the story, waiting to find out what happens.I have read a number of her books now, and the only thing negative I can say, is that she doesn't write enough :).Check out anything she's written. It's well worth the read."
5,Break the rust!!,"Man if you have dust on your stereo,or rust on your chrome-just play sometesla and it will blow all that crud right off!!.Saw these guys back inthe 90's playing SAC""S clubs',what great memories!!"
5,ABOUT PERFECT,"One of the few bands that started rockin' and never changed their tune. Alot of Tesla fans ""shined away"" from this one....... bad idea! Arguably their heaviest and best work. Spin it 3 times and you'll be hooked. Shine Away, Solution, Invited, Rubberband, Wonderful World....... not tunes that that many people know. You all should. These are only a few of the jewels of this recording that is about perfect. Keith's voice is stunning, and I love the acoustic phrasings that are all over it, but it still loses none of it's heaviness. I can't say enough about it. It's just wonderful."
5,Rock the way it's meant to be played,"I've alway's thought this record was their best, but many hardcore fans are unable to let go of the first two albums. MR and GRC were classics all told, but Bust a Nut song for song betters them both. If you've never heard Tesla before quickly skip to track 10, Earthmover and relish it in all its sonic glory. Tesla has never been about relenquishing its integrity to the fad following public. They are about writing great bluesy rock that lyrically mimic lifes ups and downs."
5,Opened my eyes!,"These guys are no-b.s. rocknroll! Had the times been different, this album would've taken them to a career high, instead it marks the end of a sadly discounted and overlooked American rock band. Check it out, you won't be disappointed!"
5,Thanks Amazon,Once again I recieved my order in a timely matter. I can't believe how easy ordering on Amazon is! Now to the review of the Cd. Rodney Crowell is a true country singer and songwriter!
4,Remastered with three bonus tracks...,"This is an album from 1988 that was just remastered with three bonus tracks. If I was a C&W fan I would know this album because it was huge (5 hits). But not being a big C&W fan I still enjoyed this album which crosses over to rockabilly and honky tonk quite often. Also includes a duet with his ex, Roseanne Cash."
5,A very readable and complete exposition of Genesis.,Dr. Ross is one of the most respected Old Testament scholars in America today. This book brings new understanding to the foundational book of the Bible. Dr. Ross is extremely faithful to the scripture and writes in a way that makes even the most difficult passages easy to understand for all. Dr. Ross currently is O.T. Professor at Trinity Episcopal School of Ministry. He has two doctorate degrees from Cambridge University. This book is used as the text book in a number of seminaries around the world.
3,Ok for the Price,I've been using the bags for about 6 months. They have held up ok. Just wish they were waterproof.
5,Easier than going to the store,"Easier than going to the store (couldn't even find it in the store!) Came quickly, too."
5,Modern Aesops Story,This is an impressive and fun to read book. It offers children a terrific opportunity to sharpen critical thinking skills while empowering their interest in politics. Absolutely wonderful; My twin girls loved it. I also bought a copy for my local public library. There is currently a waiting list to check it out.
5,Libs Heads are spinning,"Its so funny seeing all the retarded liberal hacks ranting against a book they have never read. I love seeing their heads spin like a gyroscope, there is no doubt their heads will explode and send a billowing mass of stale air into the atmosphere which in return will contribute to global warming...poof!! up goes an empty headed liberal moonbat..too damn funny!! I cannot wait to buy this book."
1,Idolatry of Money,"In a recent radio interview, Mrs. DeBrecht described a conversation with her young son which served as inspiration for the title of this book. The conversation took place during the Bush/Gore election campaign, and when she said she was supporting Bush her son asked why. Her response, as she described in this interview, was that she supports Republicans because they allow daddy to keep his money for himself.If you wish to teach your child to value money over all other matters, you have found an author that shares your interest, and this book will likely serve your ends. But if you have a more Christ-like conception of family values (Jesus, after all, did warn that you cannot serve two masters), then you may want to steer clear."
1,Because I'm a 6 year old politician.,"I first saw this book and I said ""Heh! Awesome! Satire in childrens' book form!"" then I read it and realized that I was actually in the childrens' section. This book was WRITTEN FOR CHILDREN. What?! First of all, it's sad that people are trying to instill cynicism and hatred in their KIDS. They're supposed to be playing pretend outside and having fun with their friends while they still can, not worrying if their friend's parents are left-wingers.It just screams ""Help! Mom! There are People That You Don't Approve of and Therefore Refuse to Associate With Under My Bed!"" to me. Concider this: replace the word ""Liberal"" with any term that applies to you and ask yourself if you would be offended. For instance Catholics, Gays, WASPs, Rabid Religious Types, etc.All I'm saying is don't bite us and we won't bite you back, ok?Cheers,Little Planet"
1,That was brilliant,"Do you realize, in the description on here, it says 'It's just a plant' is a liberal book? But in the book it portrays liberals as evil because they force the kids to sell broccoli with the lemonade? It's wrong to do what you want with your body, but it's wrong to tell people what to do with their's!Cant wait for her next book, help, mom, there are aborted fetuses under my bed! Comes with wire hanger and real fetus tissue!"
1,Blatant political propaganda.,"This book is blatant propaganda. Check out this blurb that shows how incredibly unrealistic a portrayal this story is:""Liberals keep appearing from behind their lemon tree, taking half of their money in taxes, forbidding them to hang a picture of Jesus atop their stand, and making them give broccoli with each glass sold.""Coming from Northern Ireland where people have been killed by terrorists who were taught as kids learn to hate others on the basis of religion or political affiliation, this book offends me."
1,What Has This World Come To?,"I supposed when the children who were read this grow up they will be fully capable of making informed decisions about the world and politics. Anyone who truly desires their children to grow up intelligent and well-rounded would not purchase this book. Even if you are a staunch conservative, why would you pull your child into the cruel world of partisan politics? A sad read."
1,Whiney Children Turn Out to Be Repuglicans.,"That's what the studies show. No wonder they whine and scream, 'bias,' everytime they don't get their way. Now they're turning on children. It wasn't enough that they started their own Pravda station and are falling in the polls. Keep up the excellent work making fools of yourselves!"
3,THE LAST CHASE SOUND DID NOT MATCH THE MOVIE,THE MOVIE WAS GREAT! BUT NONE OF THE VOICES MATCHED ANY ONE TALKING THAT SUCKEDVERRY DIAPOINTED IN THE SOUND IT ALSO IN MONO 2.0AT LEAST THEY COULD OF MADE SOUND BETTER. I REMEMBERED IT SOUNDING GREAT AT THE MOVIE HOUSE IN 1981. IT IS KING OF A WAIST FOR 20.49
1,THE LAST CHASE DVD,"I BOUGHT THIS WHEN IT WAS FIRST RELEASED ON AMAZON. THE AUDIO WAS ALL MESSED UP, I RETURNED IT AND WAITED UNTIL,I READ ANOTHER BUYER'S FEEDBACK AND SAID IF IT HAD A NEW UPC STICKER OVER THE OLD ONE, THIS WAS THE CORRECTED VERSION DVD, I BOUGHT IT AND THE AUDIO IS STILL MESSED UP, STAY AWAY FROM THIS DVD, IF YOU HAVE A VHS COPY KEEP IT AND WATCH IT."
1,"great movie, bad dvd","I have been looking for this movie for a while. While the movie itself is a rather campy and could have a few more things developed in the plot to help pull it together, it's entertaining and an interesting commentary on today's world from the late 70s/early 80s. The movie was originally released in 1981.Unfortunately, the DVD I received was flawed: the video was a bit behind the audio. You can watch the movie (it's akin to a poorly dubbed foreign film) but it's obviously not the best experience. The issue was known by Code Red (the publishers) but these DVDs apparently shipped before the problem was detected.Amazon's customer service told me they will ship a new disc to me on June 23 when they have the new inventory. Hopefully that version will be printed properly."
3,Finally,"Great movie! Who ever did the DVD got picture and sound out of sync, however I still enjoyed it. Amazon offered a refund but I kept it anyway(it's still that good) they gave me a partial refund and I didn't even ask for it, that was cool!! Would have given A+ rating if it weren't for manuf. error, thanks I still like it"
2,Frustrating,"Reviewing this record is not an easy job.Maria has put in these songs so much of her passion and genuin melancholy that somehow makes you feel you ought to like them by respect.Strangely you don't.Her music combines raw guitar riffs with cellos and violins on the background but the only cases her haunted-rock formula works are on ""What else you want to know"",""I'm Awake"" and ""This Perfect Dress"",certaintly the highlight of this album and one of the best songs of her entire carreer.On final analysis,the basic problem with ""Life is sweet"" is that it has been stripped of by any kind of sweetness.A more tender aproach by Mckee would have made this sound so much better."
1,Why bother?,"One can greatly admire an artist's desire to try something different, and in this case it isn't hard to respect Maria McKee's efforts to make her ""experimental"" album. But nonetheless the problem remains -- no matter how much one respects her efforts the album still needs to be listened to, and at that level ""Life is Sweet"" is a very difficult album to warm up to. So as much as you might admire McKee and her efforts to try something different you need to ask yourself this question: Why buy this (especially at the very steep import price) if you aren't going to listen to it?"
1,Major Misstep From a Great Singer,"Always a remarkable vocalist, Maria McKee really dropped the ball with this one. It isn't the absence of the country edged rock she made with her band Lone Justice (sort of Dolly Parton fronts the Blasters), nor is it that this one distances itself from the more polished sound of her first two solo efforts. The problem here is that few of the tracks on ""Life is Sweet"" can even be identified as songs. The production is far too overbearing that it drowns any melodic or lyrical interest that might have been present with a more comprehensive approach. The most die hard of McKee fans might want this to complete their collection, but newcomers should, without question, pass this one by."
5,A stunning CD.....a lost treasure.....play it loud!,"In time 'Life Is Sweet' will be regarded as one of the finest rock albums ever released. From the Pixie-ish opener 'Scarlover' to the echoes of My Bloddy Valentine in the title track outro, this record exudes a jagged beauty. Thank you Maria."
5,Happy with this,"I looked at several options and went with this one based on the reviews and look of the item. I got it for my grandmother who has a hard time holding all her cards, and while at first she was somewhat resistant to trying it out, she quickly took to it and actually preferred using it every hand over holding all her cards. It holds the cards well and the back row sits the cards higher up than each row in front of it (like seats in a movie theater). It seemed well constructed and to do its job well. I was a little nervous that it is not curved so as to better protect the cards from prying eyes, but playing against her (I was to her right, and someone else was across from her) no one else could see the cards. So, I'd buy it again!"
4,Makes Holding Cards EASY!,My husband purchased these after we used some similar at his grandparents. It made organizing our cards soo easy - aad best of all...no hand cramps! Love!
4,Great fun for reluctant readers,"I bought this book for my son. He's a ""reluctant"" reader, but this book held his attention long enough for him to reach the end. That fact alone led me to purchase quite a few other Scooby-doo books, which he also enjoyed."
1,tabloid propaganda,"I admit, after about halfway through, I couldn't finish the book. There was nothing of any real value to what I read. NO organization the size of the NRA (over 3 million members) is without its share of controversy or disagreement among its members, but this book doesn't even try to capture an objective picture of this aspect of the NRA. Instead, it's like reading low grade political material slamming the competition, as though the author was being paid to make the NRA look as bad as possible, as apparently, he was. I pity anyone who reads this book expecting to learn anything about the NRA. I recommend books by Gary Kleck and John Lott for those wishing factual, objective information about gun control and, peripherally, the NRA."
1,My opinion,"My opinion on reading the Amazon.com review of this book is that the Amazon book reviewer is being permitted to interject person feelings about the subject. Review the book, not the topic."
3,Almost worked for me too,"All I needed was my Dremel tool to get this thing to fit in the bay my 5.25"" DVD drive came out of. The top corners were too tight and the hole for the slim DVD drive was so tight that the drive couldn't close properly. After an hour of blood (yes blood) sweat and tears, I got it to fit properly.It's a shame the measurements are off, they used a very good quality materials to make it. Would I buy another one? Yes, but only if it came with a new grinding wheel for my Dremel."
3,Not Quite What I Expected,"It looks nice and the idea is compelling to have both slim DVD/Blu-Ray Drive and 3.5 HDD drive or 2 SSDs in one 5.25 compartment. I would give this product 5, but... it didn't fit in standard case. Be ready either to cut some metal on the sides like I did (2 mm) or simply return it back. I didn't mind to fix, since there are only few alternatives to this one and not exactly what I needed."
2,Disappointed,"This thing is definitely great in theory, exactly what I was looking for to install a slimline drive in my new PC, leaving room to put an extra hard drive in too. First off, it doesn't come with mounting screws which is kind of ridiculous (I've seen much cheaper alternatives that do include screws). More importantly, the quality leaves a bit to be desired. The space for the drive was a bit warped on one side and was rubbing against the door of the drive. The mesh that conceals the 3.5 drive also rubs against the bottom of the drive door. In order to have the drive close and open properly I had to work it over with some needlenose pliers. Wouldn't recommend."
3,almost worked for me,"I attempted to use this to store a slim dvd drive,along with a 3.5 to two 2.5 drive bay converter.the drive bay converter fit in nicely, no issues there.however, when attempting to put this cage in, it did not have the holes on the bottomrequired for my mounting (in an htpc case).i ended up not using it and getting a normal 5.25 cd drive , which have screw holeson the bottom standard.oh well"
5,My grandson will be so excited!,My 4 year old grandson is a animal expert. He watches Nat Geo films all the time. He has a book that shows a Red Panda. It is very hard to find one the toy realm. He will be so excited to have one.
4,Inside America,"This is a take-with-you-book that contains lots of information pertinent to industrial plant tours around the country. There are no glamorous color pictures or other coffee-table attributes, just 1,000 facinating places to visit with the family or friends for a cultural look at the inside of America."
1,PPPP-UUUU,"I recently purchased this deodorant from a local retailer to replace my Toms of Maine unscented stick that I finished. It is entirely possible that it is my body chemistry, but within one hour of application I have such a foul underarm stench I can't even stand being around myself. I think I would smell better if I ate a few heads of baked garlic, spicy chicken curry, and sat in a sauna wearing no deodorant that I smell wearing this. Yuck!"
2,Sticky and disappointing,"I was so excited to get this because it has gotten great reviews, but was sad when I discovered it leaves me sticky all day and does not help with scent after an hour. It sometimes even makes my underarms burn and irritated. It smells great but does not cut it for me. I tried to give it to my bf but it did the same thing to him. I'm sad because now I have to throw it away after trying to use it off and on for months."
5,A Great Read,"I'm not going to say too much about Whispering Springs, because in truth, this book speaks for itself. Filled with adventure, mystery, and ghostly appearances, it is sure to keep the young and old alike glued to the pages until the very end.I especially liked the Kansas prairie setting and the way modern and old were gracefully woven together to give you both a sense of history while keeping you firmly in the here and now.The title, The Secret of Whispering Springs, hints that there is more than meets the eye within its covers, and as you race through the pages, you'll discover the story keeps it promise. A great read."
1,The worst name book I've ever bought.,"I love languages and names in particular, and I am used to purchasing name books. Buying this one, however, has really let me down. Some of its drawbacks I can think of, off the top of my head, are: it does not include a number of current and even trendy names, the pronunciations are often not written clearly (with an occasional ""just flat wrong"" pronunciation given), and some of the definitions and origins are inaccurate, if not completely inaccurate. Sure, any name book can have a lot of interesting names, but my suggestion is to buy just about any baby name book /but/ this one."
3,"Found ""Multicultural"" section lacking","While this book has many fine choices for names, I bought it as I have a mixed heritage and would like to reflect that in the choices for my children's names. However, the multicultural aspect was at times nonexistent, and in some cases, quoted names that were not of the origin specified. There have been discussions on Internet Boards about this book, all readers have questioned the research as I have. Would recommend as a general baby name book, but if you want more than a less than one sentence meaning or accurate ethnic names, steer clear."
2,Second to last in this category... don't waste your $$,"Before becoming a dad (well, I will be one in October), if you paid to me I would have never guessed I'd be reading a book on this topic today, but you see: here I am, browsing through a handful of books off of the shelves looking for ideas. Here's our case: my wife and I wanted to name our baby with a beautiful name (how original, huh?) that is not repeated anywhere near (family and close friends) and that plays well both ways, in English AND Spanish without anyone needing to twist their mouths to pronounce it.I had a chance to check out this title and didn't find it useful enough for what I had in mind. In fact, it almost made it to the ""bottom"" of the list of books I reviewed today. Essentially, what it provided was an alphabetized list of names for girls, and another one for boys, without much regard for any particulars (geography, language, etc.) Definitely fell short. I'd recommend ""A World of Baby Names"" or ""From Aaron to Zoe""."
2,Not helpful at all,"I was hoping to find unique names from other countries and their meanings, but I found this book pretty boring and I don't care for it."
5,Heal the Divide,"Wilber offers the only viable solution to heal the divide between science and religion. This book is a must read!Gudjon Bergmann, author of Living in the Spirit of Yoga (2010) and The Seven Human Needs (2006)"
1,False premises. Tortured defintions. Unenlightening.,"The premise that the deeply religious (those with deep beliefs in specific religions) and deeply scientific (those tied to scientific method as opposed to specific theories) either feel a strong need to integrate these aspects of their lives or would be willing to give up ""truths"" in order to do so is more questionable than, as Wilber claims, arguable. To buttress his argument for integration of religion and science, he draws a straw man definition of each -- neither of which is acceptable to respective practitioners -- then predictably tears these definitions down. The philosophical window dressing he employs indicates that he has read (or skimmed) much critical literature (exposing the surfaces of science and religion, in which he claims to be looking for depth), but he clearly does not understand the practices and tenets of them (the deeper meanings). This is a perplexingly manipulative and unenlightening read."
2,"Interesting read, but a basic misunderstanding of science.","I enjoyed Wilber's writing, but his argument about the common ground between science and religion makes some assumptions about science that are just flat wrong. He draws a line between 'broad science' and 'narrow science' to support several theories including that meditation is a 'portal to the Divine'. Science makes no such distinction. Things are either verifiable, repeatable and relevant or they are not. It was a distorted presentation based on a tortured definition of what science is and is not."
4,Well written.,"I am one who does not believe in the marriage of science and religion. It is true: science does allow us to discover truth, while religion does provide meaning to life. But science deals with a physical, non-human, cold-blooded world, while religion is highly connected with human sensibility, morality and purpose. The best treatment of this subject is contained in the book The Bible According to Einstein."
2,Food for thought ...,"What is it that does not completely resonate about this book? Perhaps it is my distrust for occasional flippancy and the factual and textual errors in his writing. I find it hard to move past that when reading something that is to be of such high standard on a topic that is meant to stir a great shift in being. Putting that to the side I can appreciate his straightforward statement at the start of what he hopes to achieve but in the end I was not sold. I left the ""lot"" without purchasing the car."
5,"If you read only one KW book, make it this one","I've read five Wilber books so far (Brief History of Everything, Theory of Everything, One Taste, Eye of the Spirit, and Marriage of Sense and Soul) and this one contains the most comprehensive, clear and complete exposition of his ideas. I don't know why Kirkus calls it ""labarynthine"", because I found it also among the most readable and humorous. I love hearing him slam away at the excesses of post-modern theorists. I also think this book has the most lucid descriptions of the quadrant theory, the pre/trans falacy and other big Wilber constructs. The ""theory of everything"" books both felt like he was always talking about the theory without ever really taking you through it. This is the one to get to really get going with Wilber."
4,AN EXCELLENT SUMMATION OF WILBER'S PHILOSOPHY,"The few negative reviews seem to be from some who have not read Wiber's other works, of which Science and Religion is a summation that often refers to the others for more details. Clearly, a quick read of S & R will seem ""vague"" or lacking in detail. However, for those with open minds, it presents a brilliant overview of what ails society (that's us) and what can be done about it. Having read Teilhard de Chardin in the sixties (who Wilber refers to), I believe Wilber has pointed to the moon, and the way to go."
1,if you can't say anything nice. . .,"mom always told us that if we couldn't say anything nice about something, then just don't say anything at all, but we just can't help ourselves here. this book was friggin horrible. i have just three words to describe it: redundant, redundant, redundant. now i don't claim to be any sort of book critic or spiritual philosopher, but i beleive that i can tell the difference between a ripe horse apple and a good book, and the marriage of sense and soul is a horse apple ripe for the chukkin. if you value your time on earth, do not read it."
1,Bringing preliterate thinking into the modern era...,"is pointless, inadvisable, and ultimately impossible. Very good writing, though. This may be the most gripping book I've ever read that was completely wrong from beginning to end."
5,this book rocks,This book is so informational on bestiary and its fun to read too. It will definitely help you if your doing a report on it. The illistrations are amazing! I never thought that there was such thing as a Manticore. I recommend all of those beast lovers to go out and buy this book. It will help you alot on reports. Or if you just dont have a book to read and you happen to pick up this one. Its wonderful.
1,THE SONGS ADVERTISED ARE NOT ON THE CD!,I ORDERED THIS CD BECAUSE IT SAID THE SONG DEAR MRS IS ON IT. IT IS NOT ON IT. I SHOULD HAVE KNOWN BETTER THEN TO ORDER FROM AMAZON. MY BAD.
1,Waste of money,"I was hopping this product was really what it promised to be. However,$80 later I discovered that it was complete waste of money. Not only it did not help, but I think to some extent it made the problem worse. they should have money back policy for this kind of stuff."
3,Good...not great.,"I do like the way these products make my skin feel - silky & smooth. The exfoliate is very ""gritty""...so I assume it is doing a good job. This is just an observation, not a positive or negative comment. The cream is nice also, odorless, makes my skin feel soft and smooth, with a very slight greasy feeling. After several weeks of use, I do see some modest improvement in my KP, but in all fairness, my KP is pretty bad and I've yet to find a product that makes a significant difference. This may be the best product combo I've used thus far...I'm going to continue to use it and see how things progress."
1,Not worth the money,"I've been using this product for my moderate KP for about 6 weeks. I haven't noticed a change at all. I read other reviews before buying it, most of which were positive, but unfortunately, my experience was not the same."
2,Not impressed,"For this being as expensive as it is, it does not work nearly as well as the Glytone KP Kit. I have keratosis rubra and the glytone kit works much better at a fraction of the price. My dermatologist recommended it and sells it in his office, but it is much cheaper on Amazon. You have to keep using it, since there is no cure. I use it in combination with a prescription lotion that combats the redness. If you have regular KP, it should do wonders. Also, if you are going to be in the sun, make sure you use a lotion with SPF in addition to using the Glytone kit. Don't waste your money on the Dermadoctor."
2,Did not work for my 15 month old baby,My baby has KP and this product did not improve his condition at all. at least it did not worsen them. I am moving on to find a better solution for my baby.
2,"Smoother arms, but no change in appearance","I have KP pretty bad on my arms. I used the scrub/lotion combo as directed until it ran out (about 2 months). My arms were definitely smoother & softer, but it had no effect on the red, patchy appearance. For $80 I want it to look better, not just feel better. Although it might work better for someone who has only mild KP."
1,Does not work,"I tried the kp duty lotion only.As I was afraid,it only made my skin softer but did nothing for the bumps or redness.I saw other reviews that said the same.Back to the drawing board"
2,DERMAdoctor Regimen kit,I was charged an additional $22 to be able to pick up the item ? was told it's duties by the broker?
5,Amazing results,"Absolutely love this stuff. I have tried all kinds of soaps and lotions,but this is the only thing that has worked for me."
5,Band-it works,This simple product gives support to upper forearm near elbow.Way better than Ace product.Gave me inst ant benefit from discomfort from a chronic low grade tennis elbow.I use it and am more focused on ice and rehab than before Hopeful for improvement
3,Too wide for small woman's arm,"Although this item is a good product, it was just too wide for my small arm. It just looked huge on me, and I knew I wouldn't wear it. It is 2.125"" wide. Fast shipping."
3,Nice but not very useful,"I am 66 and play softball. I wanted something to help avoid tendon pulls when I throw or bat. This device is easy to put on, but when it feels tight enough to be helpful, it restricts circulation enough to cause tingling in my hand. It is too heavy to use during activity. I found an all cloth band at Dick's Sporting store that works much better."
3,comfortable to wear,very comfortable to wear and not bulky at all. easy to use. very well made. very happy with my purchase.
3,It works,"This product works. I had epicondylitis in my right elbow from a bike accident and it relieves the pain from lifting weights. The only issu I have is you can't work out effectively with it own if you sweat. It slides down your arm a bit. It is a little bulky too and the velcro underneath tends to catch your clothes. The bottom line is if you have on a short sleeve shirt and just sitting around typing, this product is great."
5,Passed the test,"I work as a mailman for the post office, and I constantly use my right arm when sorting and delivering the mail. I've had a nagging case of tennis elbow for some time now. I came across this product while searching for ways to help my injury.I've used this at work for three days so far. It doesn't take long to forget that you are wearing it, as it is very lightweight. As each day goes by, my arm is feeling a little better."
2,May not fit all forearms,"I bought this band for tennis elbow. This is a counterforce type brace which is supposed to reduce the tension on injured tendons, in this case the tendons that originate from the lateral elbow.The problem with this brace is the hard plastic pieces. As others have noticed, theses plastic pieces do not bend well. So unless your forearm fits perfectly with the plastic, you may not be able put enough pressure on the extensor forearm muscles in order to reduce the tension on the injured tendons.I have a simple Mueller brace with a gel pad which works better. I have not tried the other braces yet.Hope this is helpful."
3,"Works, but isn't very comfortable","This does what it claims; it does give me relief from elbow pain (golfers elbow). The problem with it is the straps are stiff, rough and thin. They really have an tendency to dig into my skin, particularly when I tighten it down to work out. I'm sticking with it cause it works, but if I had a pile of money or could do it over again I would probably try a neoprene like product with thicker more comfortable bands. Another minor gripe is the black on the logo rubs off really easily. Get it a little wet with sweat and rub against it makes you look like you have been playing with a broken pen."
4,Arm Bandit,"Great Product. It's adjustable so you can loosen it or tighten it to your liking. Unlike other products, this gives you solid support and helps relieve the pain of tennis elbow, tendonitis, and pain caused from over use."
2,BandIT,"Waste of money. After wrapping it 3 to 4 fingers down my forearm from my elbow, the BandIT eventually slips down to my wrist. If I try wrapping it tighter, I begin getting that tingling sensation in my arm indicating its constraining circulation. Unbeknownst to me at the time I bought this, my mom had another kind of therapeutic forearm band which is wider and stays in place."
4,Pain free,I've been pain free after playing tennis each time I've worn the Bandit and it's easy to use and doesn't interfere with my game.I love it!!!
3,Forearm band,"Service, delivery, pricing are great. However, I am not sure yet if the product will help my tendinitis. Time will tell I guess."
4,"good product, but I still have Tennis elbow",One of the best arm straps on the market.Helps a little but when you have bad tennis elbow this will not allow you to continue playing pain free.
5,Bandit,"Best way is to fit bottom (blank) side under arm where it will rest on desk, then tighten. Works well. Hint, use bubble wrap (med sized bubbles) on edge of desk where arm or wrist hits end of desk. Secure part under mouse pad and let rest hang over. It helps. You can adjust for smaller or larger arm."
1,Broke on first wearing,I used bands of this type for weightlifting. I have tendinitis in my left arm and I need to apply quite a bit of pressure with the forearm band. One of the plastic clips broke the first time I tried it. The Ace product is much more durable and allows application of more pressure.
1,Useless,"This thing stinks for working on computers, or on a desk. Maybe its good for sports but I dont see how as this thing is super uncomfortable, will not recommend, will not buy again, sugest you get the Ace brand one"
1,Niot what it looks like,"From the picture, it appeared the BandIT had that little bump that is so important in tennis elbow braces. It doesn't. As a result, I have found it useless, in that I will never use it."
2,Pro Band Sports BankiIT Arm Band,"This is not what I had hoped for. The plastic piece is big for my arm and isn't comfortable when my arm is bent. Also I wanted to use it for tennis, and I played on a hot sunny day and of course was sweaty. The band kept slipping down my arm. Perhaps if you are a bigger individual this might work better."
5,Good for moderate tendonitis,"I use the BandIT Therapeutic Forearm Band for weightlifting. I also use it when I'm doing heavy lifting at home (moving things, working outside, etc). I had moderate, but bearable, pain in my elbow from tendonitis when I lifted heavy things, especially if I lost balance and had to correct my form. I don't experience any pain from that while wearing the forearm band.It was slightly uncomfortable to wear for weightlifting at first, because the sides of the Velcro straps are a little sharp. But my arm toughened up to that after a few workouts, and I don't notice it anymore."
4,Good to prevent and cure the elbow damage,"Have used it for more than a month now. It helps to prevent more damages to my tendon on front arm. My arm feels much better even I continued to play tennis once or twice a week.things I don't like:Not a comfortable fit, the tightening strip might loose during the middle of a play."
1,Velcro Digs Into Skin,"OK, have tennis elbow/tenonitis from computer keyboard/mouse related injury, the 2 hard curved ""claps"" holds are great but the velcro straps between teh clasps dig into the skin of the arm if you decide to tighten it to firmly hold the affected muscles. I have to wrap my arm in a bandage before I can use this product from Bank-it. Padding on the plastic clasps for the muscles are fine but the velcro is the issue. Not worth buying but I got this from the doctor and am looking for a replacement. Like wht I see from EpiSport but still looking..."
5,The best!!,"I have tried at least 5 similar items, but nothing beats this one, ordering another one soon!!! I had been dealing with tennis elbow as my favorite tennis racket is so stiff, with bandit, barely feel any pain after playing.thanks bandit!"
2,Not what I was expecting,This device tends to slip down my arm and the only time it does not is when I make it so tight it cuts the circulation from my arm. It manages to subdue some to the pain and that is why I gave it a two star rating. I would go with a wider one that is a little more expensive. You get what you pay for.
4,works great,I like this band. I bought it to help alleviate pain from tennis elbow. I wear it while playing tennis and it is very comfortable. It also helps with the pain. I haven't tried other bands so I don't know how this one compares.
5,BandIT Works Great!,Received the product from the vendor in a timely manner. Probably the best forearm brace I've tried and I've tried several model and brands.
5,The best!,This is comfortable and takes all presure off of your elbow. I could not believe how well it worked......
5,very effective.,"I have been suffering from tendinitis for many months. I had an old arm band that wasn't very effective. My physical therapist recommended this one and from the first day itself I felt the difference. It has a nice grip and doesn't get loose through the day, that holds the muscles without putting pressure on the tendons. It's also easy to wash. I highly recommend it."
2,useless,"Save your money and purchase a plain type of strap band, this is a joke, I don't see any good support."
3,"3.5 stars, better than nothing.","I expected more from this product, but that may be an impossible desire. Tendinitis just plain sucks, but the bandIT helps with managing the pain. I bartend, and the constent lift and twisting from pouring drinks aggravates my tendinitis daily. This product helps me get through my shift and the pain is far less than if I didn't have it on."
5,good timing and safe shipping to mexico,It is great for the Tennis elbow. It helped me get through the pain and get back on the court sooner than expected. I now wear it every time I play and even outside the court
4,Elbow tendonitis,It is very effective and it works immediately. I would recommend it to golf players.It works for me very well and the price was reasonable.
2,Didn't like it,"I did not like the BandIt brace. It was less comfortable and more difficult to adjust than other elbow counter force braces I've tried. Also, I wore it on my left forearm and the exposed velcro completely ruined a good wicking polyester golf shirt in only one round of golf. The velcro rubbed against the shirt on every swing and just shredded it. I've been using elbow braces for many years and never had one damage a shirt before. The BandIt went straight into the garbage can after that."
1,Didn't work for me,"Does not fit properly, the straps dig in to the skin if tightened sufficiently to rest the tendon. Loosening the strap causes the strap to slip and not be effective"
2,It's not very comfortable,I've had golfers elbow for a while and I needed a strap to help. I bought a soft one that goes all the away around your arm and this one.But I prefer my soft one any day over this. The soft one sits more securely and is less in the way during normal movements.The Velcro on this strap is very rough and digs into your skin and the lack of contact with the skin means this thing slips off when the muscle is not contracted.
5,Band-It elbow braces work great,"These are great armbands for alleviating tennis elbow pains. No, this one doesn't have the little pneumatic bubble, which some prefer, but this works just as well or better."
1,Not a helpful product,"I was trying to find a replacement for the strap my doctor gave me for Tennis Elbow which has inserts to press against the tendon and works very well. However the ""Band-It"" product does not help my tennis elbow at all, I believe because it does not have the insert."
4,Professional therapy,"This device was given to me by my Occupational Therapist at the end of treatment for golfer's elbow. It changes the mechanics of forearm motion (pronation, supination) to lessen the stress on the tendon attachments to the epicondyles. I can now work with weights and swing a golf club with confidence. I'm buying an additional one today on Amazon. The only drawback to this excellent device is that the Velcro-ed strap stretches a bit with use."
4,BandIT Therapeutic Forearm Band,"Works really well to help reduce the pain. Without it I would not be able to bowl! Really,really helps. I would recommend it to a friend."
5,good,"I recived before the expected date, and the product is good. Its very comfortable to use, same product in the store but higher cost."
5,Just what the doctor should have ordered.,Man what a difference this product has made. I can wear this product all day with out any issuses. Thanks I would recomend this product to anyone experiencing tennis elbow or golfers elbow.
5,Instant relief!,"I recently purchased the BandIT and can't believe how well it works.It provides instant relief from the pain of ""golfer's elbow"".It has a very simple and slick design and fits well.Easy to put on without the aid of someone's help.I would definitely recommend it."
4,Does its job,"Does its job, Easily adjustable and looks like it will last a lifetime. High quality product. Should not need to buy more than once."
1,Useless,"This Bandit was supposed to help for my elbow and my carpal tunnel syndrome. It didn't for the first one, and made the second one even worst. I'm not using it anymore..."
4,one of the better braces,"I recommend it. Used it for my tennis elbow, for all those tennis enthusiasts out there: if after 6 months you still can't play without the brace, consult a doctor."
3,Leaves red marks,"My ""repetitive stress"" elbow is improved after wearing it, but it does get uncomfortable after a while and leaves red marks on my elbow. If I adjust it with my elbow straight, it becomes uncomfortably tight when I bend my elbow and my muscles expand - there isn't any give in the strap they use.I am presently using a neoprene strap type elbow support most often, as it expands during exertion rather than becoming a tourniquet."
4,Good Product,"This wasn't the ""magic bullet"" I was hoping, but it helps control a bad flare up of Golfer's Elbow for me when I'm really hurting. Some reviewers suggest wearing it all day or all day and night, which I hadn't tried for extended periods, but when I get really bad pain this thing puts the breaks on it."
3,Not so crazy about this one,"I bought this item for a problem I have with my right elbow. I had done some research and seen this on a you tube video and was thrilled to find it on amazon. I haven't been that pleased with the performance. It doesn't seem to relieve my pain at all. Perhaps it is not the item, it may be the problem in my arm. I have bought a few differnt items with this brand name and they have been quality items"
5,Fantastic product,"I was using a regular arm band and still played with pain on my elbow. I tested the theory of the BandIt by placing a couple pieces of high density foam to simulate the effect and it worked better. Then I ordered and tried the BandIt for the last 2 months and it is even better than my contraction.Now I play without pain. And the BandIt is actually less tight than my previous band. To a point that I can just slide it on without having to adjust the Velcro strap.Overall, it is more comfortable, excellent support on the key muscles and best yet, no pain while playing. I'm very happy with the purchase and it is well worth the money if you are suffering from tennis elbow.Update: (2/2013) After 1 yr of usage (twice a week, 2 hrs of solid rally each session), I have regained 90% of my strength. 3 months into it, I actually can remove the BandIT after warmed up and play w/o it for the rest of the session. Well worth the money if you ask me."
5,relief,I bought a BandIT to help in the treatment of my golfers elbow suffered this past fall. I wear it while bowling and sometimes while doing household activities to minimize pain and add support. Since doing that my elbow injury has gotten much better. Haven't tried wearing it golfing yet. If I'm lucky my injury will be all better before the season starts.
1,Contact allergic reaction to this product,"Not sure what material is in this, but I developed red welts where the plastic touched my skin through movement after wearing it for only a couple hours. It functioned well in creating a point for the muscles to push against, absorbing some of the movement that would have gone back to the tendons at the elbow. But as others have noted, it doesn't give, so in some movements it was too tight, and loosening it made it ineffective in other movements.But the allergic reaction is something I've never had to plastics before.And the velcro strap is quite scratchy.So the design may be good, but the materials used are bad."
2,The band cuts into your arm.,"The review title says it all. If you use straps and such to lift. These will hurt you. The Velcro straps cut into your arm, the tighter you make the strap the more it cuts, period...."
4,not happy,i had to reorder this item after it broke after one use the previous one lasted over a year without breaking just got old hopefully this one will last longer because it is the only thing that helps me from getting pain in my elbow region tennis elbow
1,Should be NO stars for XP users.,Amazon description says this works in Windows XP. The product packaging says no such thing. It does not work in XP.
4,A Boy Finds His Place in the Old West,This is a good book for a third or fourth grader to read. It teaches some about the pony express and what it took to keep it running. It also is about a boy who ends up in the old west where he would rather not be but learns to like it.
4,"Good read, good laugh, good gift","It's early Barry, which means it has some of the freshness his newer stuff now lacks, and is not so wary of saying anything that may construed as offensive or flood-of-hate-mail causing. It's the perfect gift for any smart-alecs you know who are tying the knot, and not a bad read for singles. It's a good laugh, and best of all, a destroyer of some of the myths and cliches that surround both subjects."
3,These strings are OK but not great.,"The strings have a great tone that lasts, but they have some construction problems. The loops on the E strings tend to unravel when brought up to pitch. You have to be careful to bring them up to pitch very slowly to prevent this."
4,My home town,"I grew up in Belleville, IL............I am half way through the book. I love the descriptions in the book, names i recognize and the unsolved cases. I remeber these cases from when i was in highschool, The girl found at East High School and Im hopeing he is somehow connected to Christine's case (I Knew her ) and met her daughter when she was 5 ( a beautiful little girl)This is my first Alva Bush book but plan on reading whatever I can get my hands on."
4,Belys for a belt sander,I haven;t used these belts yet but they seem very well made and should hold up well.
2,NO subtitles AND NOT HAVE TITLES FOR DISABLED.,No subtitles and notThat is unacceptable today.We are disappointed.It is a high quality movie and not understand why they sell it without that. It is discriminatory.
5,Not Very Factual,"The contest that this story revolves around never happened and Picasso barely new Modigliani so beware, but I still found it entertaining."
5,Love Modigliani,Modigliani is one of my favorite artists. Andy Garcia playing him is perfect. This is based more on the love story than his art but I think it is beautiful and sad. Soundtrack: Amazing. The special affects in the snow scene: brilliant.
4,Modigliani,"A sensitive yet very 'realistic' portrayal of the bohemian/artistic atmosphere in Paris at the turn of the last century. Every artist watching this movie would want to BE THERE! The actors are beautiful (although sometimes a bit too American to pass of as convincingly Italian/French etc). The rivalry between Picasso and Modigliani is a dominant feature, (I am not sure that it was the case in reality), but otherwise sticking to biographic truth. The art works and scenery will blow you away. Worthwhile!"
2,Dark life = dark movie,Andy García played Spanish poet Federico García Lorca so well; I had high hopes for his portrayal of Amadeo Modigliani. These hopes were only partly realized.This movie needed tighter direction and García deserved a better supporting cast. Jeanne Hebutern was visually arresting and well acted. The rest of the cast were only so-so. I have seen the film once now and once was enough.
5,A Heartbreaking Masterpiece,"The movie itself is a work of fine art. Every aspect of it is well done. Even if the details of the story are not historically accurate, the essentials are, and it is presented with convincing depth of understanding of the characters.Artists in any medium get into a zone of inspired creativity which makes any and all sacrifices for their chosen field acceptable. Garcia, as Modigliani, enacts that so well while painting the important painting in the story, that I think anyone who has never experienced that ""zone"" could understand it from watching him - not the other artists shown painting, but just him - throughout the creation of that piece. He was so convincing that I felt as if he were channeling the artist."
4,Good Movie!,Really liked this movie...more than I thought I would. Makes me want to learn more and then watch it again!
3,I Expected More,"Don't get me wrong I am like a really huge fan but I really expected more from this album after I had listened to her third studio album 'Trip the Light Fantastic' but Read My Lips did not deliver. I really hated Groovejet (This Ain't Love) Live Version, the orginal version so so much better than this garbage that they included on this album. But don't get me wrong there were some really great tracks on here like Murder on the Dancelfoor and Move this Mountain just to name two out of the eight tracks that were really good. The others were decent but yet forgettable."
3,Uneven 'Lips',"After scoring as the voice behind Spiller's UK smash 'Groovejet',Sophie Ellis-Bextor unleashes her solo bow READ MY LIPS. Those expecting more closer to the lines of 'Groovejet' will be sorely disappointed, however. The set's first single, a remake of Cher's disco classic 'Take Me Home', is definitely first-rate, and the thrilling 'Murder on The Dancefloor',the album's best track, is also exquisite. But they are the few-and-far-between gems scattered across a program that, though nicely produced with a nod to eighties synth-pop, fails to live up to the thrills of those two tracks. Vocally, Ellis-Bextor is like a female Robbie Williams--though utterly distinctive, her voice doesn't have huge range, and even on occasion recalls fellow UK chart siren Geri Halliwell(you can be the judge on whether that's good or bad). Overall, it's a solid, if not particularly spectacular, debut."
2,"One good song, the rest are awful","The first two songs on this CD, ""Murder on the Dancefloor"", and ""Take Me Home"" are fun disco numbers. The live version of ""Groovejet (If This Ain't Love)"" is okay, but I'd much rather listen to the studio recording. The rest of the songs are worthless. Their style is completely different from the upbeat disco number I expected, and nothing like the wonderful ""Groovejet"". The music is all syntho-pop that sounds like it is being played on a [...] keyboard. [...]"
4,Top 10 Euro Dancebeat Album,"While I was touring through Europe last summer, this album could be heard blaring out of most any club, most any car-stereo, and for good reason; it's no-frills, well-produced, perfectly disposible dancefloor eurodisco that still sounds melodic, and won't urge you to kick the speakers down after listening to it.What really got me is SEB's vocal delivery; like the Backstreet Boys first few albums, the beats are perfectly suited to her sultry (and very British) voice, and the production is flawless--Nile Rodgers, eat your heart out.It's not breaking any new ground, but with killer singles like ""Murder On The Dancefloor"" and ""Get Over You"", it doesn't have to be."
4,"Slick, fun Euro-pop","Sophie Ellis-Bextor is sort of like Kylie Minogue's less famous, more edgy, 2nd cousin. After the first couple of listens, tracks like ""Murder on the Dance Floor"", ""Get Over You""(my favorite), ""Music Gets The Best of Me"" and ""By Chance"" stand-out immediately as pleasurable dance music that sticks in your brain. However, after several other listens, tracks like ""Universe Is You"" (where she sounds like a 21st century Debbie Harry), ""Is It Any Wonder"" (reminiscent of Dido and Jem) and the live track ""If This Ain't Love"" surface as proof that Ellis-Bextor is more than just a vapid pop dance Diva.She has the chops to back it up and the original delivery to make more than just a passing mark on the music scene. Here's hoping the music industry takes more notice."
4,Retro Funk!,"Sophie Ellis Bextor thrives on retro-funk, sometimes undeniably campy like on the track Sparkle. The original issue of the album missed out on two greater tracks now issued as singles - Music Gets The Best Of Me and the ultra catchy eye-ya-eye-ya-ya Get over You as well as the live version of the #1 hit Groovejet by Spiller.A re-issue with extra tracks suggests that some of the original material are perhaps more filler pop that would not have performed well if released as singles. The reissue completes the picture. There's the funky retro of Gregg Alexander in Murder on The Dancefloor and Music Gets The Best Of Me, the futuristic GeT Over You, the disco dancing Take Me home and the trip-hop I Believe and Is It Any wonder, the latter helmed by electronic maestro Moby.Bextor tries everything and anything but the distinctly playful disco vibe of the yesteryear resonates far and between. Doesn't hurt that she has a pretty face and voice! Definitely a star with disposition on the rising."
4,I KNOW I KNOW I KNOW THIS IS RIGHT!,"So sad that the USA only saw the release of the commercial single for ""Murder On The Dancefloor"", and that US. radio didn't gave Sophie a chance. This album should be consider the other side of DIVA-dance music opposites to Kylie's ""Fever"". Sophie's dance album is more in a chill out mood. Many highlights in this album, ""Murder In The Dancefloor"" the obvious dance track that focus on the cheatin man kind, ""Get Over You"" hayayai...what great song, it carries the message of getting over that cheating one!, ""Music Gets The Best Of Me"" feel good time song, great!, ""Take Me Home"" remake of Cher's classic, well done, in all this album will deliver a great feeling to your home and great start for a eurodance diva."
5,Thorough,"As chairperson of the social medicine department at Ohio University College of Osteopathic Medicine, Norman Gevitz knows firsthand the details of ostepathy. This book is a thorough, well-written review of osteopathic medicine's climb into the medical arena; originating from the depths of the mind of its founder, Andrew Taylor Still in the late 1800's, into the growing profession of the 1980's. Unfortunately, however, it does not cover the growth and expansion of osteopathy in the last twenty years of the 20th century. It does explain, though, the legal and social struggles that osteopathy survived in its first 90 years. Gevitz also does a wonderful job explaining what ostopathy is and how it evolved from a holistic, drug-free approach to medical care into an alternative, legally licensed medical practice. I highly recommend this book for osteopathic medical school applicants. It is also an excellent book for those interested in the history and sociology of medicine in the United States."
3,Historical,"Good history of Osteopathy from 1828 to late 1970s, but the modern osteopathic techniques are not mentioned (book was published in 1982..so a lot is missing in this recent time period). Otherwise a good thorough history."
2,Ouch!!!,"Rainy Davis (her real first name is Denise) had a couple of minor R&B hits with her 1987 album ""Sweetheart"", a plausible if not extraordinary effort. When I found this, the obvious question before listening was: Did she evolve of devolve? Sadly, the answer is B. While she can be given credit for having a cute, appealing personality, she falls rather flat on this album, which does not have any standout tracks. Not God-awful, but very tepid."
2,BIG ouch!,"Her first single, ""Sweetheart,"" though a moderate R&B/Dance hit in 1985 (and remade by Mariah Carey 13 years later,) gained SOME radio airplay, but it wasn't enough to make Rainy a household name by ANY means. Her voice is fairly thin/weak (a la Brenda K. Starr) and although she's credited as having written much of her own material, she still struggled to make the upper reaches of the Dance/R&B charts. This, her second outing, is definitely a downer as compared with her ""better but not by much"" debut."
5,Simple LIfe Pleasures,"This is a fabulous example of the simple life of times past. What joy was found in just being together as a family with the added fun of ""going to town""."
2,Standby doesn't work,"This product works okay except if the computer trys to put the monitor in standby, it doesn't work. I am returning the product."
1,You never know what you're gonna get!,"With this product, you get to be surprised every time you sit down to the computer. You never know if it is going to switch between your two computers and, if it actually does, you are probably going to be looking at a screen in 800x600 video because it can't properly detect the video mode. Most of the time it just fails to recognize the other machine and you have to unplug everything and re-plug it in. It has a lot of cabling which basically just clutters up your cables without adding any value. Definitely avoid."
1,Belkin Flip does not work with Windows 7,I purchased this because Belkin told me it would work with Windows 7. It does not work with Windows 7 or my XP laptop. I am returning it.
4,"Good product, easy installation just a little slow","The Belkin FLDF102U Flip lives up to what is advertised. It is easy to install and works perfectly for my needs. I have two computers on my desk and need to work with both machines with only one monitor and keyboard. My only complaint is that when you ""flip"" to the other computer, it is a little slow to give control to the other machine."
1,Arrived in a box looking bad.,Arrived in a box and looked very sorry for themselves. Perked up after a day or two but died way to soon after that.The idea of Fedexing flowers is really not a good one!!!
4,A strong ensemble of wonderful music,"John Jorgenson in his latest Solo project brings you to another place in Emotional Savant. This CD which is full of great hit's such as Off My Back and To Tomorrow get you turning up the sound. At the same time, ballads like Black and Blue spiritually talk to you in a way modern music has forgotten. Overall, an excellent CD."
3,Emotional Savant,"John is a master. This is an early work and not indicative of his talents. The music sounds together but it lacks tht certain spark that comes with maturity. This man can play better that all that I have heard, and this album is technicly done well. It is not one I would have purchased if I had been able to listen to all the way through. I will still buy and listen to his new works. But the player is different now."
1,So Disappointed,I ordered this CD collection hoping that it would have some songs from La Fea Mas Bella. What this consisted of was Angelica Vale singing songs when she was probably a teenager. I love Angelica and have been watching her novela for the second time. I do not plan on ever listening to her CD again.It was a waste of money. I would love to buy a mature CD if she ever records one.
4,Edie Brickell: All of Her Music,"All of Edie's music is a beautiful listening experience for me. Her expressionistic and animated singing style along with her ingenius musical scores provide the listener with an upbeat feeling. Since seeing her in the early stages of her career, I am a true fan of the New Bohmemians"
5,A Masterpiece,"It will remain a frustrating mystery in my life why this album did not and still does not receive the recognition it deserves. Every single song is crafted to perfection, her voice is truly unique, the music is deep and sonic and the lyrics are absolutely amazing! I still can't believe that Edie wrote ""Good Times"", I would swear it was an old 60's song by some soul legend. This album is in my top 10 of all time and I don't care if no one else understands! But I wish they would. Do yourself a favor and buy this masterpiece. This is some of the best, most honest music I have ever heard."
4,Picture Perfect Imagery,"Edie Brickell has proven she can combine the prosaic with the inspirational, and make rejuvenating even the most haunting lyrics. Her voice is wonderful and her intuition with lyrics is subtly brilliant. A very relaxing CD, but one that makes you listen carefully more than once."
3,How to learn french teach yourself,I think this book would be good if you already knew some previous Frech but can be a little confusing at times.
4,indispensable resource,"As anyone knows who has undertaken learning a foreign language, finding a well-structured book is essential. This book is an indispensable part of my library of French learning aids. I was introduced to it by my private instructor. She is a French-language instructor at the UN in Geneva. This book provides a basis for much of her teaching, and convinced me to buy a copy for myself."
5,Great book for beginning to learn torchon bobbin lace,The reason I like this book is that the diagrams and photographs are clear and use colored threads. You can learn how to make beginning torchon bobbin lace on your own with this book. Descriptions of how to wind on your bobbins and how to start are defined well and the method to make simple bookmarks all the way through to more advanced projects are explained in detail.
2,"It may have been fine, but the book should have never been sold.","This book was so damaged, I felt used. Most of thge pages were stuck together and when torn apart, I could not read anythiing that was of any help. Shame on you for sending this mess to me......"
3,iStyle Personal Makeover,"I bought one of these programs for my niece(Age 13) and she used it almost everyday. It was most used the day before school dances because she tried to figure out exactly what to wear. I guess it worked real well because when I say her pictures, I was amazed!"
5,Emotion with a beat,"At last, the new Aim album has arrived, and it might well be his best. Once again Andy Turner creates emotional music from the various sounds he weaves together. From the dark urgency of ""Walking Home Through the Park"" (after dark presumably) to the upbeat ""Puget Sound"", Aim is able to evoke feelings with his music that most other producers can't pull off. There's music here to make you smile, and give you chills. This time out he's left behind the hip-hop beats and ""guest rappers"" to concentrate on the warmer side of his music, and it's a wise move I think - this is the music he does best. I think fans of Bonobo, Hint and Jon Kennedy would enjoy this too."
4,The 5 minute review by robidoux,"These seductively cool tunes could quite easily woo the unknowing, but they remain the same. Not too shabby though...."
5,What and Incredible book!!,"This was the most amazing book that I have ever read! I could not put this book down, I did have to put it down a couple of times because I was crying so hard. Bruce Marchiano words are so powerful and touching, I borrowed this book from my Sunday School teacher and I decided that I must purchase one of my own so I can read this book over and over."
2,"PLEASE, WHY?...","It's a shame that a great composer as Count Basie has this kind of treatment with his work, I mean the music of this album is EXCELLENT!, but I can hardly understand how Amazon has been edited this cover. Oh my God what a bad print!...I think this kind of things shouldn't happen and less with the work of geniuses like COUNT BASIE"
1,A Mimeographed List of Hessians in the Revolutionary War,"Buyer beware. Be very careful before buying this ""book."" The chances are high that you will be disappointed. This is a highly specialized manuscript. It is a list of Hessian soldiers who fought in the Revolution with very little additional text and hardly any commentary at all them. It is just a list of names of soldiers and where they came from -- not much more than that. If that is what you are after, it could be great; if you want more, you are in for a big disappointment with this purchase. Considering its high price and that is a stapled manuscript (truly backed in paper), it could turn out to be a big disappointment to anyone without very specialized needs."
3,CANT GET THERE FROM HERE*,"These book talks about how street kids try to survive on the cold streets.the name of the characters are,Country Club, Maggot, 2Moro, jewel, OG,Maybe, Rainbow, and the younguest one Tears,These kids got kicked out or got out of their houses because of family problems.At first i didnt like the book but ones you get into it,your going to like it."
5,cant get there frome here,I liked this book alot because it teaches you about homeless kids.My favorite part of the was the fight with the drunk.I like it beacause of the fighting mostly.My other favorite part of this book is whenmaybe got to go to the club.I like it because it lets you know how cruel people in the world are.Over all this was a really really really good book for people to read so you should read it.
3,can't get there from here,You should read this book because there are these kid's that are homeless because their mom's or dad's kick them out of the house.So they have no where to go.They try to find a squat.A squat is a home that is abandoned.Once they find a place like that and they have all of there stuff they have left in it and the cops come and take all of their stuff they own.
4,can't get there from here review,"I think that the book was great , but not better then any of the Alex Rider series.I relly like to read action, and spy. cant get get there from here is a good book and I would recamened to kid over 13 and, who like books about killing and drugse, ect. If you would like to know more about homeless people living on yhe street.You sould read this book."
3,Street Kids,"This book is about kids and teenagers that live on the streets.I think this book is kind of boring because if kids read this book,they might try and run away from home and become a street kid a start bad things like DRUGS.AND ALCOHOL.These kids might get into trouble with the law and get arrested.the book I am talking about is CAN'T GET THERE FROM HERE.From: Jake parker[yeah]"
4,can't get there from here is a great book,"the book i read was can't get there from here. it was a book about homeless kids there names were tears, maggot, rainbow,2 moro, jewel,and country club. no one really liked them because of the fact that they were homeless. everyone but one person his name was anthony. he was the kindest person they met and he liked them even though they were homeless.i liked it and i didn't like it. when people were dying like rainbow died, 2 moro died, and country club die is when i didn't like it. but when the kids were back with there families. and when maybe was with anthony and anthony said there are different ways to live and the streets aint one of them. he knew that it was time to get off the streets and get better in a group home is when i liked it.by:jo-lin ratchford"
3,A Good Book!!!,"Can't Get There from Here is a good book. Some parts I didn't like the book, but most days I loved the book. A few chapters in this book was hard to understand. I guess it was hard to understand because I couldn't relate to it. For example, when it stated Rainbow had been murdered I couldn't imagine what or how anybody who knew her on the streets felt when they found out what had happened to her. Then again I loved some sections of the book. Like, when maybe was only trying to help her friend and return her back home. Some sections of the book were hard for me to understand .I loved to read and didn't want to stop reading. I think if I could relate to the whole book. I would've enjoyed the book a lot more. I think this because I don't relate to teenage run aways."
3,can't get there from here,"I think that the book Can't get there from here is a very good book for young adults. I think that my favorite charactor in this book is Maybe,because she is very honest and i personally think has the most interesting life out of all the charactors. She also tries to get money and food by cleaning an old mans house. It was a serious but also kind of funny at the same time."
1,"smelly, disgusting book",The book I just received actually smells. The pages are yellow/brown. They are marked with permanent marker and the book is stamped from the Philadelphia Library ALL OVER IT! The book is a disgrace...something you would find in the trash. How dare Amazon mail it and charge well over the cost of the book to ship it here! Never order from them again and never use their cc either.
2,Can't Get There From Here,"This is a fictional story of a struggling tribe of homeless kids, and one of the main characters is a girl, named Maybe. She tells us what happens throughout her life on the streets of New York. She also tells us how members of the tribe die from being on the street too long. But she also tells about people that want just to help and get nothing in return but just to see the kids get a better life than the one they have on the streets. I really liked this book because of how Todd Strasser gave us an idea of what happens to kids on the streets and that's why I recommend this book for not just adults but teens also. It gives us an idea of what happens everyday when you are sitting in a warm house, with clean clothes on your back, and food in your stomach."
4,cant get there from here,her name is maybe. she was thrown out of her house by her abusive mother she struggles to survive on the streets with other homeless kids who call themselves family. has they live there lives in there squat (an abandoned building) they have to do whetever they can they do from prostotution to begging on the streets for some spare change just so they can eat. As they're on their struggle one of the teens has a dog and has to feed not only his self but his dog too. later in the book at least two of the teens get sent to a good home. And 3 of then die so then theres just one kid left but u have to read the book to see what happens to that one struggling child
1,Kids are kids everywhere and they all deserve respect.,"This movie is outrageous. The two lower points: racism and lack of respect. Lack of creativity and cliche (as saying all black people look alike). Kids was mistreat and emotionally abused there(as when Pauly Shore start talking bad about the hair of a black kid, call other black kid chubby, or thrown other black kid at floor pretending he was being arrested? Why he didn't got any white kids there, as his audience for his show in the same place, same movie, were all white?) And come on, kids in the rain? Losing kids from orphanage? All this abuse was only because the kids were black? Black kids are thieves? Really?Could somebody imagine a black person going to Sweden to adopt white kids and losing then or mocking about their appearence being considered ""funny""? That's just wrong, nothing new."
4,Call of Duty 3,The player has less control over the health of the soldier. Health restores after a few seconds of avoiding fire rather than picking up first aid packets. This is not a bad thing but needs to be gotten used to. The computer appears to do more for you than in call of duty 2 which makes it an easier game to just pick up and play but also negates the skills learned in playing the other call of duty releases. Overall it has excellent graphics and is an enjoyable experience.
3,Okay,"This was fun for a little bit, but it is no where near the materpiece that Call of Duty 1 and 2 were. I suggest skipping this one all together, but thats up to you. After Call of Duty 4 it's been all down hill from there."
4,half and half,I got this game for my boyfriend. He really likes the graphics and how realistic it looks. The only thing about it is that sometimes its way to hard and there's to many guys coming at you at once you almost need a second player to help you. Overall its a good game.
1,Make a PC version and I'll think about it...,"Call of Duty started on the PC and there's no PC version of CoD3? What's up with that, Activision? I know it's common to put out an FPS game on consoles, but let's face it, FPS games suck with those teeny controller joysticks.Put it out on the PC where you can REALLY play it and I'll considering coughing up the cash for it."
4,Big improvement over other COD games,"I bought COD3 for my long-in-the-tooth-but-still-kicking XBOX before I got any other COD games and was quite impressed with the graphics, gameplay etc. as other reviewers have noted.Now that I just finished COD2 Big Red ONE, I can say there is a HUGE difference in COD3 - it's much betterWhat I was particularly impressed with is the game AI. In Big Red One, it seems every German took 2-3 shots to kill - reminded me of the old Wolfenstein or Doom days. They just kept popping up again like punching bags.This is MUCH better in COD3, as is the interaction w/ your squad mates.Unlike other people, I found it tough to plays this 1-2 hours at a time. I'm afraid I rand through it in about 3 sessions including a few late nights early into the morning. I guess that is a test of how good a game is."
2,for newbies only,"This book is for newly diagnosed only, i found no new information here; just a slightly interesting story by a nice person."
5,The ONLY book a diabetic needs! With cookbook of course.,Thank you Dewayne for sharing what you have learned with all of the rest of us. I am so grateful for the courage he had to not only get through his experience but keep going on to success in what must have been a very scary situation. He had no example before him to follow. I cant say enough good about this book!I have read and re-read it and will continue to do so until I also am no longer a diabetic.I am getting every diabetic person I know to read the book. I have learned from my own personal experience that what he is saying is the truth. I just ordered his cookbook.I started following the advice in his book and my numbers went to normal for the first time probably since I was a teen.
5,type2 diabetes and the reversal,"I was diagnosed with type two diabetes in January last year;2011. I freaked out and began stressing about a lifetime of illness, when by chance I came across Mr. McCulley's speech about his reversal of type 2 diabetes and became interested in knowing more. I eventually bought his pdf version of Death to Diabetes and since then have lost 27 kilos of weight and now off my medication. I praise his book highly; and recommend that anyone with this illness to get in contact with this gentleman and his/their Drs., you have only one thing to lose, a lifetime of misery. I cannot say enough. Frank McDonald"
5,MD Endorsement,"I recommend this book not only to all diabetics but to anyone who is suffering from his or her unhealthy lifestyle. Although Mr. McCulley's theories are not strictly in line with current medical thinking, his advice for changing our lives for the better is right on. Over half of all Type 2 diabetics who strictly follow his advice will be cured of their diabetes problem, as well as lowering their cholesterol and blood pressure. Don't miss out on this book. William Bayer, MD"
5,A Must Read... Not Just For Diabetics!!!,"What a great book! We all should thank Mr. McCulley for sharing his experiences and what he learned as a result of his life-threatening bout with diabetes. As an engineer, I appreciate the way the author attacked the problem and fundamentally broke the disease down to it's basic elements. With this approach, cause and effect can easily be understood and proper solutions identified to address the problem. The results for Mr. McCulley were astonishing, and I'm sure mystified many doctors and pharmacists along the way. The way Mr. McCulley explained his concepts was outstanding and made the book easy to read and understand.I have recommended this book to all of my family, friends and every diabetic person I know. I can't say enough good about this book... This is a must read book!"
3,a different perspective.,"Although not a medical doctor, I found this book a good explanation of the world of diabetes."
1,"don't bother, something wrong with the formatting","there was something seriously wrong with the kindle version of this book, I asked for a refund. I was dissapointed."
2,No better than any other book source,"If you are already well researched on diet, supplements, hypoglycemia, health, etc. this book doesn't really add anything new. The Claims for any new wild better eye-opening discoveries/plan/powerful simple steps will fall short and you will quickly thumb through this book and realize it did not deliver anything that you haven't already read elsewhere.If you are not well read, this is a good resource. But it really is no better than any other doctor authored book and I wouldn't recommend this book at this price because it is no better than the lower-priced books by medical doctors.It's a three star book. But I gave it two stars for over selling a book that has information widely written elsewhere and that is a letdown for an approx $25 purchase"
3,pop meets dub,"I've had this cd since it came out in 1989, and I was listening to it again this morning for the first time in several years. Catchy lyrics (if you can get through the thick English accents) that are placed over some electronic dub tracks. RSW's later work is all dub (no vocals, reggae/dancehall influenced), with heavy, deep beats. This is an interesting snapshot of some late '80's synth-pop before the genre was broken down into electronica (what is that anyway?), breakbeat, techno, etc. There is a great cover of the English Beat's ""Can't Get Used to Losing You"". Two tracks from this album were pushed as singles, ""Probably a Robbery"" and ""Biting my Nails"". The instrumental tracks on this album are great."
5,I'm completely baffled why this only has 3 reviews ?!?,"I continue to be shocked over the years by the lack of appreciation for this album. I remember when it came out, it was completely different than anything out there. I feel in love with this album. It was light years ahead of its time and you could tell the moment you heard it. I'm insanely jealous of Gary Asquith and the other members talent as musicians. The creativity of the sound and style is baffling to me....It was the mid 80's for crying out loud. I still listen to this album today and it sounds as fresh as ever."
5,Very nice plotting and curve fitting program,"Our research group uses Kaleidagraph daily for plotting and fitting data. The program is easy to use and powerful. We have used Kaleidagraph for years, and were very happy to see the new features in version 3.5. I would recommend Kaleidagraph for anyone who needs to do scientific plotting and curve fitting."
1,Disappointing,"A very disappointing effort. Not a memorable song in the bunch. It becomes quite evident that Rob relied very heavily on the talents of his ex-band members. I'm dumbfounded that he quit a Grammy-winning band because he just had to make this record. Maybe my expectations were too high, but this sure answers a lot of questions."
3,"Well, yes, but...","Sprightly, cheerful, yet ultimately lightweight and unchallenging Celtic-fusion instrumentals, basically trad-based, but with flourishes of reggae, pop and classical styles woven into the sound. Shannon is a superior musician, with dazzling technique on both button and bow, but this is music that was made to sit in the background, and doesn't really move me. No onerous synths or outlandishly ""pop"" arrangements, and a welcome softening of the standard severity of the trad style, but still a bit cotton-candy-ish and bland."
5,Fabulous Album,"I had never heard of Sharon Shannon until a friend of mine insisted I listen to Out The Gap. I ran out and bought my own copy the next day. This is a stunning album. Every track is great. It gets richer every time I play it, and I've played it maybe 500 times. I'm sure most people have never heard of Sharon. I don't know whether to tell the world or keep her our little secret. When your tastes grow up and you get tired of the sludge that passes for ""music"" these days, come home to Sharon Shannon. You'll be glad you did."
3,Not exactly on the mark,I enjoyed many parts of this book but the title does not really describe the actual content of the book. If you subscribe to the pholosophy of the group that the author is affiliated with you might find it more interesting than I did.
2,Sills is the ULTIMATE Lucia!!!,Sutherland cannot compete with Sills in this role. Sutherland has less accurate coloratura than Sills. Sills singing coloratura at her fastest is faster than Sutherland singing coloratura at her fastest. Sills' Lucia is haunted and demented. Sutherland's Lucia sounds like she is on hallucinogenic mushrooms. Her Mad Scene is ridiculously corny and cheesy. She might as well be singing Juliette's Waltz. Give me a break!
2,not good enough for my ferret,"even though this made my ferret smell quite nice for about 24 hours, it made him unbearably itchy, even more than usual. he spent more time scratching than playing. it might work for your ferret, but i would say get something gentler just in case."
3,Good History and Philosophical Overview of Marxist Thought,"I'm a student of philosophy and I was therefore able to understand some of the more intellectual parts of this introduction. I do not feel however that someone unacquainted with philosophy or Marxism would not find this book both informative and helpful. Also, it's short and has a lot of pictures. I read it in one night!"
5,Great at preventing diaper rash,We have used a few different types of diaper rash creams and Acquaphor works better than anything else at preventing diaper rash by providing a good barrier. It has also helped prevent rash from drool on our baby's chest. Acquaphor doesn't work as well other creams once the rash is in place.The packaging is nice to use until it reaches the end - I prefer to squeeze out the ointment rather than digging around in a larger tub. Unfortunately it is difficult to get all the product out of the tube.
5,A classic,"Almost as brilliant as Faulkner's The Sound and the Fury, the novel succeeds in weaving a intriguing set of events but observed by four different characters. The intricate historical details set against the backdrop of a murder mystery offer a credible account of Resotration England, Renaissance Italy and the rest of Europe. I can safely argue that this is one of the best books the appeared in recent years despite claims that it is inferior to Eco's The Name of Rose."
2,"Definitely NOT a whodunit--by the end, it's ""who cares?""","Well. I finished this book this morning and was very disappointed in the final section. I enjoy mysteries that can actually be figured out and have logical explanations; when I read, I enjoy a world of rational events. This would be a good book for someone who was just reading to read, it's full of detail and historical characters, and it would be good for someone who enjoyed reading about RELIGION! I didn't know it was going to have a religious foundation, which I wish someone would have told me before I was only 100 pages or so from the end! Too ambitious, too convoluted, and not worth the title ""mystery."" Good general historical fiction, and tons and tons of immersion, although sometimes the details do intrude a little."
1,"""The Name of the Rose"" it is not!","Drawn to ""Incident.."" by its bold comparisons to one of my favorite books, ""The Name of the Rose"", I was very soon disappointed by its differences. While ""Name"" gave us characters to sympathize with with, ""Incident"" gives us none. More often than not, the story became as bogged in the mud of details. Inarguably, considerable knowledge of the English civil war is needed to follow the distinct storylines of each of the main actors in this historical drama. Like a prism, the color of the story changes depending on the angle from which it is viewed. Unfortunately, the colors of the people of the story are almost unanimously dull. If you are searching for history-based drama and sympathetic characters, read ""Name of the Rose', Jakes' ""Kent Family Chronicles"" (""The Bastard"", ""The Americans"", etc) or ""North and South"", or, more desparately, selected books by Jeffrey Archer; leave ""Incident at the Fingerpost"" on the shelf."
1,YAWN,"This book was a snoozer!! The narrators drone on and on to a point of tedium one rarely gets to experience in life.But for those who didn't like the ending I think you are missing a major point. The last narrator THINKS the woman has supernatural powers, but that doesn't mean she does. His narrative is not intended to be any more accurate in an absolute sense than any of the others. So, his ""take"" on this character is just that: HIS TAKE. It's not the horrible unbelievable ending it's being played as by some since a man in the 1600s may very well have held such beliefs.Still, the book could lose a few pounds of wasted words and maybe with those wasted words missing it would have been decent. Otherwise, it's just an experience you could end up resenting as you throw good money after bad."
2,just couldn't get through it,"Tried as I might, I just couldn't get through this one. This has never happened to be before. I used to think I could get through anything.....just got bored."
2,Too long and way overrated.,I agree with Salon reviewer Daniel Reitz. The real talent here was in the marketing.
3,Don't loose the track,"The book has several 100 pages and the same story is told by four people from very different viewpoints. I at least could not well remember the facts as being told by the first narrator as I read over the other tales, let alone appreciate the more subtle variances of the story.Moreover Mr. Pears irritated me with his show-off attitude about the bizarre aspects of 17thcentury ideas. He let us have glimpses of medical treatments and ""truths"" about national and political sciences not to give us an insight into the times or into the relativity of ""truths"" but to provide an easy laugh at earlier stupidity. It would have worked the first two or three times but then it became tiresome, at least to me."
4,Conspiracy Theories,"England in the 1660s. An Oxford don is found dead. A hunt for the murderer ensues. Conspiracy theories abound, each self-serving the world views and prejudices of the participants. I like the ability of the author to assume different minds. This tome requires patience - which is handsomely repaid when we reach the concluding chapter."
3,"Demanding, but good","This is a very long book and each section is told by different people, retelling the same events, so you may have to reread a bit to make the side-by-side comparisons since by the time certain names and events are mentioned again, you're likely to have forgotten their first mention.It's an interesting glimpse into that historical time period, but the end is real left-field doozy that I'm not sure the author entirely earned.I have to say that, for sheer enjoyment's sake, I enjoy Iain Pears' Art History Mystery series better."
3,Very Intricate Mystery,"If you like a good mystery and have a lot of patience, pick up ""Fingerpost"". The narrative through all the different viewpoints was very interesting and Mr. Pears paints a very entertaining and descriptive picture of 17th century England. Writing how four different people pretty much in the same place at the same time can see the same thing so totally different was very nicely done.It's downfall is that once you reach the fourth and final character, you can deduce who the ""killer"" is with still quite a bit of the book left to go. Having already read and disproven three different viewpoints, the climax to the book comes sooner than you'd like."
3,"Good, not great","""An Instance of The Fingerpost"" is one of those books that starts out wonderfully, then gets caught up in its own cleverness and thus becomes only sporadically interesting. Pears spends the most time and effort on the first narrator, the Venetian doctor Cola, but the other three narrators do not seem nearly as well-rounded as Cola, and that is to the book's detriment. Still, not a bad weekend read and a nice change of pace for the historical mystery enthusiast."
2,a perfect treadmill of boredom,"After struggling for five weeks and becoming more and more confused by characters, events, and so forth, I simply have called it quits. My interest waned at about page 200 and I gave up around 400. Seventeenth century viewpoints were interesting and Pears style was better than most writing today. However, I many times wished for an abridged version. Like hearing Wagner's operas,it was interesting at first, but sheer length left me yawning."
5,not your ordinary whodunit,"while I have only completed parts I and II, I must pause to recommend this book because I simply cannot imagine being disappointed when the ""truth"" is revealed. I have not had the pleasure of such a page turner in a long time."
3,Neither an easy nor an enjoyable read.,"I didn't enjoy The Name of The Rose so why I expected to like Fingerpost I do not know. Although well written and full of period detail, I guess I was hoping for P.D.James does Mason & Dixon, but instead I got Lady Antonia Fraser does Agatha Christie. I can however understand how many many people will enjoy this murder mystery much more than I did. If you enjoyed The Name of The Rose then this book is for you."
3,Good and Long,"I am a big fan of Umberto Eco, and dove into An Instance of the Fingerpost with abandon. By the time I got to the third story I was getting annoyed - this character seemed crazy and I felt a bit ""led on"". I was greatly relieved to read the final version, but when I finished it I felt exhausted, but not at all enthralled or with the sense of accomplishment after tackling Eco's ""Foucalt's Pendulum"". Overall, Pears' book was good, if a bit long."
3,Good Try!,"I desperately wanted this book to work for me. I was drawn by the character of Sarah. But the plot never gelled, and the ending was a copout -- I mean, you can't get rid of your only interesting character in a single paragraph, as if she did not matter. Otherwise, I stumbled over the narratives in the three POVs, and I could not keep them straight -- who knew what, when, and why -- or even who was who after a while. The third section still baffles, but I do not have the energy to go back and try again. Instead, the book goes out in the next yard sale. I do not understand the critical hype that this book received."
3,Shallow and ignorant here.,"Sorry, I love historical novels and mysteries, but three quarters into Jack Prescotts story, I found myself relegating this one to the maybe to be read later pile. Interesting? Yes. Well written? Very. Did it transport me to another time and place? Well, yeah...the next day I went to the bookstore to find something more fun to read. Just seemed like a chore to finish this one. So sue me already."
5,a fascinating an absorbing historical mystery,"I usually dont like historical mysteries but this blew me away. the idea of having four narrators was a great techniche to provide a thinking mans whodunnit. chracters great and the history intresting, but dont read the sections out of order please!!!!"
4,Remarkable but demanding historical novel/mystery.,"Readers who are not already conversant with the history of science in Restoration England may have reason to gripe about this book, but anyone who does have even slight familiarity with that subject will love AN INSTANCE OF THE FINGERPOST.I am not sure why people insist on juxtaposing it with THE NAME OF THE ROSE, for these books are alike only in being erudite and historical with a murder to solve. Otherwise, they are profoundly different -- but readers who took to Eco's fine novel of ideas and history and mystery will find comparable ideas and history and mystery in Pears's pages.By all means read it slowly and carefully and savor it as it goes, and do not skip ahead. One of the themes of the book, as the back cover makes clear, is the chanciness and sometimes the untrustworthiness of narrators. I give nothing away by saying that.Historians and those who are historically inclined will like this book the best."
3,Not as good as it could have been,"Pears has a very clever idea here: present the same events from four different viewpoints, with increasingly intricate layering of the overall scope of events as each story is told. Unfortunately, he was unwilling to step out of the way and allow the story to proceed on its own. Pears is constantly name-dropping and placing silly little speeches in his characters' mouths and then winking at us as if to say, ""Isn't it funny when Da Cola trashes Shakespeare?"" As a result, there is no way to believe in these characters except as marionettes, dancing to the author's tune."
2,"Boring, boring, boring...","From reading all of the other Amazon reviews, I know that I am the minority here; however, I found the book to be tiresome and a chore to read. The first and last sections are interesting but the two middle sections crawled. Not what I was expecting."
2,This book is like a bad long-term relationship,"I read this book through till the end but I don't know why. All I can think is that it was like a bad long-term relationship. It looked so enticing at the beginning, and then by the time I got to the middle I was very confused and couldn't keep any of the accounts straight, and wasn't even finding the characters very interesting, yet I thought--well, I'm 400 pages into this thing so I can't stop now. And so on and so forth. I kept thinking I should put it down, and then I'd think, well I've invested so much time and effort already, maybe it will all be worth it in the end. Well, it wasn't. I thought this book was a big tease. Really overrated. Not one interesting character and by the end I didn't care at all who killed Grove and the ""revelations"" were poor consolation."
4,Pretty deep,"I'm more of a reader of historical fiction set in contemporary times, preferring novels like ""From Here to Eternity"" or ""The Triumph and the Glory"", but Pears' book caught my eye and a friend had read it so I bought a copy and settled into read it. I was captivated by the new experience of a literary mystery, but am not accustomed to working so hard for my entertainment! Still, when all was said and done I have to say I was pleased. Hurrah for ""An Instance of the Fingerpost"", it has won me over to frowning a bit in concentration while reading."
3,Mixed,"Pears is incredibly knowledgeable and has carefully constructed an intriguing and believable plot. This is one of the few mysteries which forced me to return an reread a scene three or four times. The use of the multiple viewpoints is very clever (and reminds me of Durrell's The Alexandria Quartet) and I hope we'll see other writers pick it up.On the other hand, the writing and characterizations do not gel. I don't think the problem has to do with the unattractive personalities of narrators 2 and 3, but with the juggling of the very complicated plot and the culturally-distant nature of the narrators.So a mixed reportcard. But at least it was better than the ""Name of the Rose.""Also, readers should not approach it thinking it is ""serious"" fiction. It is an intellectually-challenging period mystery."
1,This didn't work for me ...,"I am no stranger to historical fiction or mystery fiction, and I know this is controversial opinion, but this book just didn't do it for me. The different narrative voices sounded all the same to me. I found the pace ponderous, the style heavy and self-important, the welding of historical fact and fiction too deliberate, and the plot incredible."
4,"Intellectual, captivating, but doesn't fully satisfy","As other reviewers have stated, the book is much more satisfying for it's historical depictions than its mystery. Still, I recommend it. However, I need some one to explain the purpose of including the prophetess aspect of Sarah Blundy. Is this book a metaphor of the times and event of the crucifixion of Christ?"
5,Absolute Genius,An Instance of the Fingerpost stands head and shoulders above any other historical mystery ever written. The author's erudition is outstanding and his ability to make you connect with the characters is great. I would give it more than 5 stars if possible.
5,Tour de force !,"The synopsis from Wikipedia: ""A murder in 17th-century Oxford is related from the contradictory points of view of four of the characters, all of them unreliable narrators. The setting of the novel is 1663, just after the restoration of the monarchy following the English Civil War, when the authority of King Charles II is not yet settled, and conspiracies abound"".This rather succinct summary of Iain Pears' best-seller and greatest work to date, is accurate but reveals little of the magic which he has infused into his historical fiction that covers so many aspects of life in the 17th Century. We have murder and political intrigue certainly, but there is much more - romance, espionage, medical science, economics, etc, etc, all woven into a wonderful totally absorbing work of art. This book is simply irresistible and should be on every serious reader's book-list."
4,VERY ENTERTAINING BUT ......,"This is an excellent read if you are looking to wile away many hours in the midst of the sevententh century. It is easy to read and you can learn some history along the way. The story, told from the perspective of four different persons, can get a little confusing at times and, taking notes,as some reviewers have suggested, is not a bad idea.While I was dissapointed with the ending in relation to Sarah Bundy and found Jack Prescott's story to be the least interesting I must compliment Pears on a very worthy effort.If you have an interest in historical fiction you should love this book. If your interest lies more with mysteries you may be dissapointed."
3,disappointed in the end...,"pears writes well, and the story is interesting enough. the four different accounts never really feel separate though, rather they all read like one person wrote them but just made a few revisions here and there. it's a quick, light read, and it flows pretty smoothly up to the end. it's the last chapter that disappoints though, because instead of a good whodunit with twists it becomes some bizarre reaffirmation of religion novel. blah"
2,Couldnt finish too long,"I just could not get into this book, I never finished it, it was tooooo long and did not get me interetested soon enough. :( Mark G"
1,"Mind-numbingly boring, just couldn't get into this...","I bought this book to read during the four-hour train ride to New York. What a waste. An Instance of the Fingerpost is a historical novel with a touch of intrigue. I love historical novels, cannot resist them, but this one left a bad taste in my mouth. For one thing, the author drones on and on with descriptions that serve no purpose to the story. It felt as though Pears wanted to share his thoughts -- however remote -- to the reader even if it had no relevance whatsoever.Yawning and wishing you had something else to keep yourself amused are never good signs. So I gave up on this book before finishing it. I felt cheated the way I do when I watch a very good film trailer: good premise, big hype, bad outcome. I cannot fathom the good reviews here. Disappointing..."
1,ZZZZZZ..................,"This book was extremely boring. I'm a big fan of Umberto Eco, and (to a much lesser degree) Perez-Reverte, so I thought this book was a sure thing. But WOW was I wrong! I struggled through the first two character's tales, and then just couldn't justify wasting ONE MORE MINUTE on this borrrring tale. The characters are boring and horribly unsimpathetic, as is the story, as is the historical period (Cromwell does not exactly equal exicitement). The research done for the book is surly commendable but the fact is that the time period is so lame that it really doesn't lend to decent storytelling. AVIOD THIS! IT STINKS!"
4,Stick With It - You Will Be Rewarded,"An intricate plot, a complex historical background and well-drawn characters mark this novel set in 17th century England, the age of Cromwell. The first 100 pages or so seem quite slow, but the pace picks up and the plot thickens and thickens and thickens. The story is told by four narrators with vastly different perspectives. A fine effort set in an interesting period. I found this to be a more interesting work than The Name of the Rose."
4,"Good, but not great","I compare this book to two others:The Name of the Rose, which I loved for the mystery and the intellect of it, andThe Sound and the Fury, for the use of the narrative style.The biggest fault is that the narratives all share almost the same literary style, sort of like one guy wrote it all. It would have been much more fun if the sections were plausibly written by the different characters.Aside from having seen all the destruction of beautiful architecture in England by Oliver and his cronies, I know nothing of the Restoration era, and this was a good way to learn.I am disappointed by the lead-in review here in Amazon. I was totally surprised by the ending and it would have been less fun if I'd read that first.Lastly, I agree with the reviewer that said it could easily lose a hundred pages."
4,Fascinating,"This book, much more accesible than the Name of the Rose, is a fascinating look at a time so distant, it seems more alien than any society presented in Science Fiction. Pears weaves an intriguing story that is at turns sad, repellent, revelatory and funny. Although it would benefit from losing about a hundred pages (the second and third narrators seem to go over much the same material without a great enough difference to make them consistently interesting). If you enjoy this book, check out the even more accomplished novel, The Doomsday Book, by Connie Willis."
2,Concur With the Poor Reviews,"A disaster when measured against the hype and six pages of glowing reviews (not to mention a surplus of 5 star reviews by Amazon browsers). A dearth of rich characters. Uncompelling narrative that stalled all too frequently. Better historical fiction exists by writers such as Murdoch, Eco, Du Maurier, and nearly everyone else touted in high school and college literature courses. For reviewers who rate this as the ""best historical mystery ever,"" go easy on the superlatives. Of the greatest historical suspense novels, this does not rate. For an example of what a powerful narrative can do -- and to feel what it's like to be shot out of a gun based on the power of word alone -- I direct all admirers of Pears' work to read Pallisner's The Quincunx. This is a modern miracle of historical mystery."
5,An amazing work,"Just read it. I have to write more in order to publish this review, but I'll just say this is one of the best books I've ever read."
3,Interesting but ultimately unsatisfying,"This book is brilliant in its detailled reflection of Europe pulling itself out of the Dark Ages - the Middle Ages. It is also a masterful display of how different characters see the same events in totally different light, often only because of their preconceptions. Iain Pears can actually teach you a lesson if you are one of those people who never feel doubt. That said, this book becomes disappointing towards the end. Where is the big surprise or a resolution? The author doesn't fulfill his own promise - that a mistery will be solved - in any satisfying way. Disappointing."
2,Terribly overrated -- a thoroughly dark and depressing work,"When this book came out it was widely compared to Umberto Eco's The Name of the Rose. Unlike Eco's masterful work, this book lacks a single appealing character until you reach the final section. I can't remember reading something so dark, depressing, and perverted in years."
4,Send 101 critic back to 101,"Unfortunately, I cannot read the ""Send Pears back to English 101"" critic's review as I type this, or I would have handy reference to this reviewer's written screwups. Interesting. This reviewer griped about Pears' horrendous grammatical errors while committing errors of his or her own. You do not end a sentence with multiple question marks, or do you??? I don't know what style book you refer to, but mine frowns upon using an apostrophe in 1600's. You also failed to include commas in a number of appropriate places. Perhaps you should return to English 101 before you review your next book."
2,Not Enough to Keep Me Interested.....,This book started out being interesting but once I got into Part II it faded fast. I am a lover of historical fiction but I thought Part II was a rehash of Part I and the story did not seem to move forward. Quit around the middle of the book.....
3,A dark medieval mystery; heavy going.,"A densely crafted medieval mystery reminiscent of Umberto Eco's ""Name of the Rose."" Added to the cruelty of Restoration England is the pustulating evil of Pears' characters. Not light reading, but rich in period history and brightened by a surprise ending."
3,Plodding and repetitive.,"Well plotted, but I just wanted the characters to get ON with it.Honestly, seven hundred plus pages! How many trees died for this story?"
3,A novel of misconceptions,"When I read the cover blurb of this book at my local library, I thought to myself, ""Just the book for a winter's week"". And in a way, I was not wrong, it was a good read but only for the first & last accounts. The second & third tales, although germaine could have been halved in length & then perhaps the book would not have been so tedious in the middle. However I am glad I read it & will look up more of Iain Pears titles at my library."
3,I shouldn't have read all the reviews,"After all that's been written and printed about this book, I thought it would be the greatest effort in years. It wasn't.It's terribly smart and fairly stylish, but for it to truly succeed, the four vantage points from which this story is told need to be rather clearly delineated, which for me they weren't. They all sounded too suspiciously alike on obvious levels. Often they plod, sometimes forcing the cultural detail upon the reader. The result is an oft-contrived narrative, reading almost as if the author has a checklist of points he must put in his discourse. I enjoyed the mystery, but I think his reach has exceeded his grasp.Don't get me wrong, it does deserve a great deal of praise, most of all for its ambition."
3,cool but flimsy,"This Sword is Flimsy at the hilt. Appropriate for display only. Not that that's a bad thing, I just would have appreciated more warning."
1,Totally Lame DVD!,This DVD was sooo out dated and the actors on it apparently have never heard of razors or shaving or trimming up! Gross!
1,Not pleased with this in any regard,"It was ok that the suit was late because I was offered a refund for shipping and I didn't happen to need it immediately. The box it came in was tiny, about the size of a dictionary and that explained the condition it was in- all wrinkled. The suit had no tags on it which made me think used. The material seemed very cheap like something that you opholster a cheap car with. It was stretchy and nappy looking up close. I expected more from an Armani. And last but not least it didn't come close to fitting; I couldn't even get the jacket on- so much for vendor sizing charts. I guess this was a bad experience but the good news is I kept the socks and only lost money."
5,just as expected,"I bought two of these as gifts. They were shipped quickly and packaged very carefully and in a very sturdy box. Hadley Pottery also sent a price list/brochure which includes a brief history of the pottery. Too bad I didn't receive two brochures, though, so I could include them in the gift bag. The coasters themselves are pretty rugged and not cheap-looking. The shipping charge is almost as much as the cost of the coaster, however I've never seen this item in any store, and it's still a good price for Hadley. Overall, I was pleased."
5,"some human errors, but priceless theory review!","I had read some of the reviews for this book and they focus on parts where almost all books have human errors, code or math examples, but the explaination of the theory is very well reviewed. This book is very well organized and explains very well the topics. This book is a very good book for begginers on games physics and math, its not a book for learning math, physics or programming, and by reading the reviews of the book you'll see what I meant, seems a lot of people misundestood the book title."
2,"Good book, but lots of errors","This book was my textbook for a class. The book is well written and the author explains the concepts pretty well, my biggest problem is the errors. A lot of the answers in the back of the book are wrong. Since this was for a class we focused on the problems that did not have answers in the back of the book, but when you are trying to work through one of them as an example it can be difficult. We found at least 2 every week. Since I had a teacher it was not a big deal, but for those who are buying this book to study on their own it could be a bigger problem. I've seen other reviewers mark this up to human error, but when you are writing a book to educate you have to try to cut out errors like this and if it was maybe one or two fine, but there are a few."
3,Average book with nice demos,"The book can't be pointed as bad or good, the title tells everything, like the author says in the Introduction this book isnt the last one you should read for this field, its just a starting point, anyway I found it simple and you need to know some math and physics to get it all clear, besides that you have 6 nice demos with full code you can study and run for better understanding. Who wants to get a simple and clear basic concepts should get the book, others may prefer most complete titles."
2,Don't buy this book.,"I was looking for a book with Math and Physics formulas and explenation how to use them in game programming. I saw this book and took a glance in it in the book store and it looked verry nice.But it have been a big disappointment. The first two thirds of it is either verry simple (points and lines) or ""strange"" stuff like 3D rotation. If you are intrested in 3D game programming you proberbly don't buy a book for beginners. Also the structure of the book is verry wothless, it takes time to find what you are looking for.I wold not recomend this if you are choosing between this book and another. I'll give it 2 two stars, and thats a high grade for it."
1,I wasted my money on this one.,"As a Johansen fan, I'm glad I had read other of her works, or I'd have quit with this one. The plot was contrived. It seemed just a vehicle for a few scenes of torrid sex. Powerful, independent women don't have to be headstrong idiots. Johansen can do so much better."
5,Second Best Gaye Album,"There are three Marvin Gaye albums that I consider flawless and warrant a rating of 5 stars. Let's Get It On, I Want You and Here, My Dear. This is only second to I Want You. All three should be purchased by any true R&B fan."
5,"Classic, but avoid temptation","An utterly classic, highly-recommended album, but if you have the previously-released remastered version you don't need this. The two bonus tracks are the abbreviated single edits of two album tracks - hardly worth an upgrade. If you have the two-CD special edition, you've got it all."
4,Pleased With Amazon Purchases-Marvin,my purchase was delivered in good condition and in a tmely manner-thank you...will continue to use Amazon as always!
5,The #1 Love Album Ever!,"This is the greatest love album ever. This is Marvin's Romantic masterpiece, it's one of the most sexually charged albums ever recorded. Probebly my personaly favorite Marvin Gaye album."
4,ANOTHER Remastered Edition?!,"This of course is a definite 5 star album, but this comes just four years after Motown remastered the album for the first time, which was the first edition of this I owned. Couldn't they have added the bonus tracks a mere four years ago, instead of trying to gouge us for more money. The difference in the sound is hard to discern (the new version has the bass a little more upfront). I only bought this edition because I got it for a song, and I guess I can give my older copy to some poor soul who doesn't already own it. I admit I do like buying new remastered copies of CD's I already own, if only just to be able to give the old one to someone else. Music truly is the gift that keeps on giving!!"
1,Company Never Shipped or Communicated!!!!,After accepting my order the company never responded to inquiries and did not ship the product. This wasted days of my valuable time/productivity. Will probably not order such products from overseas retaillers again. Live and learn....
1,bad just bad,"I was looking up the worst LP's I ever heard just for fun. I can't believe how many of the LP's get high ratings. Only about 1 percent of the CD's get a 1 rating from me, this one got a 1 which is to say it was hard to listen to the hole thing. I like the band but this was just bad."
1,didnt work,when i tried to order this it said that it was currently out of stock and it said that there were still 2. So i looked at zephyr paintball and it said it was discontinued soooo. DON'T TRY TO BUY.
4,Fishing for Marlin,"Marlin fishing on the wall is presented well and keeps you guessing and on the edge of your seat waiting for that next strike. The film shows you many things you can use when chasing Marlin, including knots, rigs, line, rods and reels. Theres also the first hit of the marlin and the giant leeping out of the water to free himself and that is what this film captures and makes anglers all over the world to try and chase these monsters of the deep. I wish the fim never ended."
2,It is Ok,The description made this seem like it would be outstanding and biologically correct. It is not. Over priced. I could get the same thing for cheaper at any toy store or box store.
2,Does not go in depth enough,"I read some glowing reviews about this book at Amazon, so when I received it and found out it was like a coffee table book I was disappointed. I expected it to delve deeper into the thought processes of the artists, but unfortunately too many selections remain on the surface."
5,amethyst beaded bracelet,The bracelet matches the amethyst beaded necklace & I love it. Great buy for the money.
2,Nope to this,"No result with this this product. Yet another thing to carry into the woods? Well, this little can will not gonna get to go out with me ever again."
5,Great water can!,"Received mine as an Christmas present for off roading. This can matches my Scepter gas can. I saw a couple of reviews that say it won't fit a ""standard"" gerry can mount. As long as the mount meets mil-spec, it should fit just fine (mine does). These cans are the current US military issue cans for fuel, water, etc. for their reliability and toughness.The water can is UN blue, has a rubber seal on the spout (which keeps it from leaking and keeps contaminates out). Worth the price (at ~$17, it can't be beat...especially for 5GAL of water). Comes with the spout, that is flexible, and stores in itself. Nicely written across the can is ""Potable Water"". With the writing and color, its easy not to get confused on which you use for gas and which you use for water. Simple stuff to keep up with, but accidents do happen when people aren't paying attention.Would recommend to any off roader / utv camper."
5,Great product for the price!,"The Moeller Scepter water can is an excellent value for the price. I own 2 of Scepter's military water cans and while this one isn't quite as robust, it is still an excellent water can. With it's familiar jerry can shape, this can makes water storage and dispensing a breeze. It has an air flow valve opposite the spout and that makes water flow out smoothly, and the included spout works great for dispensing life saving liquid. This product is constructed much better than your big box ""water cubes"" that retail for about the same price. My only complaint is the small mouth for filling the water can. I found that the most effective way to fill these is to use the garden hose. I know some of you might think, ""Ewww...water from the hose!"" But believe me, when SHTF this water will taste like liquid gold. My advice: If your thinking of buying water cans, save yourself some money and a big mess (if you have a ""water cube"" you will eventually have a mess) and buy this water can."
4,Potable Water cans,"It took forever to get these cans made by Scepter although not as heavy duty as the Military version they are good quality I think the smaller spigot is a plus and the price compared to their Mil Std. counterpart is exceptional I did not understand why these were shipped all the way across country via UPS, and then when they got to my location had to be transferred to the US post office as per the sender which took an extra two days for delivery. Overall these will be great for my jeep adventures, and if I happen to encounter any Zombies I will be plenty hydrated, with lots of agua to spare"
1,Moeller scepter water can,"They say Military style but be advised, this water can will not fit in a standard Jerry can holder!"
1,Not food grade plastic,The purpose of this purchase was to store emergency drinking water for my family and pets.Not sure how safe this plastic is so i dont think im gona risk it!
4,Very good product,"Received these quickly after the order was placed, found them to be very sturdy. Happy with it, and would purchase them again, in fact I'll get one more to top off the emergency kit."
2,Good art ...,"I bought this book and heard all kinds of great things about it. I bought it as I knew the author. But honestly, I was disappointed. Some of this book didn't even rhyme properly. Save your money."
5,Cassie's Candy Store makes my mouth water!!,"I picked this book up after I had ordered ""Rain, Rain what a Pain!"" which is written by the same author. I was really excited by the format and the way it is presented. My daughter is 6 years old and the comment she made about it was, ""It pulled me right into the story and I wanted to see what was on the next page!"" She even wanted to know where we could buy the creepy candy.Fun for all and not your normal kid's book. Kid's give there reactions on each page which is the best part.Love this book!!"
1,Not my kind of kid's book,"I found this book and thought great. It looked like a good book for Halloween for my niece and nephew. Being a good uncle, I glanced through it and I was sorry I bought it. The story tried to rhyme but really didn't and it didn't have a story. I thought the art was great but that is all it has going for it. Sorry."
5,very descriptively written and beautifully illustrated,"This is a very descriptively written and gorgeously illustrated book.It grabs the attention of the children, making them think and use their imagination, which is good.It also teaches them about rhyming words.Nice book for children to have."
5,Cartooning at its finest!!,Great animation and the story line is awesome. Characters are complex and the overall thought behind this makes it a very entertaining anime.
4,Afro Samurai,Afro Samurai is a tale of a warrior who must do battle with various other warriors to exact revenge against the best warrior in the land. Has a lot of bloody violence it is a very good action show with really good animation.
2,Without history,"American Heritage Dictionary of Idioms is certainly chock full of idioms. However, the origins or backgrounds are not included. Without an origin is is difficult to fully appreciate the meaning and context of any given idiom. I did not find the book particularly useful."
5,Good for people new to the English Language,"As with most of the dictionary type idioms, this edition has tons of idioms that we learn at a very early age in the US, so this is meant more for an international audience. That being said, it is a great reference book for ESL students, and I am giving it five stars due to the sheer number of idioms that they have collected. This is a great edition for anyone who is learning the language. Enjoy!Todd HagopianPresident/CEOHagopian InstituteAuthor of the popular ""Quote Junkie"" book sereies and the brand new ""Idiom Junkie"" series"
2,Disappointing for native English speakers,"This is probably a great book for people learning English as a second language. But if English is your first language, it's very doubtful that you need it. I don't consider myself very knowledgeable about idioms, yet I could scarcely find more than a few that I didn't already know the meaning of. To an average American, 90 percent of this is useless. One thing I did learn was what ""chickens come home to roost"" means -- but that's surely not enough knowledge to justify the price of the book."
3,unimpressive,"I rarely use this dictionary because I also own Cassell's Dictionary of Slang by Jonathon Green, which is decidedly superior. This Dictionary of Idioms at first seems a more scholarly approach to the subject, but soon falls short of expectations as its selection of words is relatively small and mostly consists of the most well known slang. For more unusual words, I have always had to refer elsewhere."
5,A true story of faith and courage,"I read this book on my Kindle Fire at the gym. I would be on the elliptical 20 minutes before I would even see how long I'd been on it, that's how good this book is! It is an amazing story of a man who truly found God in prison and changed not only his own life, but the lives of many others who had been forgotten and left to rot in prison. We CANNOT give up on people!! Jesus doesn't give up on us, who do we think we are to give up on anybody? Read this book and I promise you it will change your outlook on things."
3,ok book,"It is very slow to read and the first half is exciting as you are reading how he continues to mess up, but the second half stops talking about the people in the first half and just speaks of his missionary work....i commend that he changed his life, however not that interesting to read about after around the 50-60 percent mark. I stopped reading at the 85 percent mark, because it was so repetitive on all his missionary work. the first half alone however gets 3 stars."
4,Feeling trapped by anxiety and the fear of change?,This author gives you the tools to make a break-through. She uses many examples from patients she has seen in private practice. At times the many examples get in the way of the basic advice. Dr. Sills does describe well how easy it is to stay in a comfort zone and not break out. As she says we are on a platform and the way to leave is only by a high-wire; which in turn causes anxiety. She slips in brief advice advocating visiting a professional and for prescription drugs. This book was helpful but brief. It could be a useful advocate for change if read an additional three times for re-enforcement of its principles.
5,Worth reading,Received in good very good conditionPassed it along to a friend to readGave good ideas to think about
2,Cheesy Drives/Software,"I have Windows 7. I had Windows XP before 7. Both operating systems I had pure hell getting the Montego Bay Turtle Beach sound card drivers installed. Time after time. I had the card installed in the computer, and the auto install could not see the card in the computer. I had several instances of this. It took a huge amount of effort to get the card to work properly. Every single time I had to re-install the card.It was very troublesome.On a side note, the card is quite good...when the drivers allow it to be. I point to the drivers as this cards weak link. If their programmers can improve the drivers...this card would fly"
1,Leaves an impression,"Leaves an impression - for the wrong reasons.Itchy eyes, skin and dry throat, leading to a headache.Any testing on this must of been quite limited to a few guinea pigs etc.I'd pay my work colleagues not to wear this stuff."
5,"This movie is truly disturbing, and compelling.","For some reason, the music (boy singing) or the colors or the horror or the humor, this movie has stuck in my mind for years until I finally had to buy my own copy. It is not for the gentle hearted, as the images are often repulsive while still being artistic. The customer who said ""if you like good food you will like this movie"" was cruel, and I hope nobody takes him seriously. I highly recommend it for anyone who likes to be disturbed and repulsed while watching beautiful art on a grand scale of opulence."
1,Disgusting - wish I could give it no stars,"I am so tired of people taking a revolting story and planned shocks and calling it art. Horrible writing and an awful, one-dimensional storyline. This movie is disgusting and leaves a terrible taste in the mouth and knot in the gut. Whosoever compares this to art is comparable to someone comparing hardcore S&M with making love. Extreme - yes. Of value - no. And I'm no prude, but to suggest that people who love someone do the things seen in this movie, and that our watching it has value, is delusional. I wonder if the director/writer had anything in mind but to shock the general populace as much as possible. Art - no. Not even close."
2,"I remember somebody in the title dies, who knew!",Pretentiously morbid and opulently crafted. Not for me.
1,A plotless plodder,"While this film contained interesting images, I found the plot to be excruciatingly boring. The tension developed in the story was unwavering and monolithic. I don't mind a tense story, but this tension never made sense to me. Why bother to create such a monstrous world and then do nothing with it?I wouldn't mind the nausea if there was some point to it.Perhaps a cinematographers union has descended upon the ratings for this movie.I think this one is for visual artists/designers only, and those who want to be shocked.I may have missed the point of the movie by not recognizing the true story, as conveyed in a secret code of costume changes and clattering pots."
1,The Cook the Thief His Wife & Her Lover,Enen tho this product (supposedly) was shipped from NJ for Region 2 my DVD player (new Sony Blu Ray) would not play it. Second attempt. Will send it back and forget it.
1,Don't Buy This Version,"Picked up this (Korean) version at Amoeba Records in California. It's edited! My roommates and I didn't make it beyond the first scene, in which the naked man's genitalia is obscenely ""blurred"" out. The transfer sucked too...it looked like a VHS. Just watch it on Netflix or rent it on here. I'm waiting for a proper blu-ray release (c'mon Criterion...If Tiny Furniture qualifies, this should too)."
3,Oh dear,What a dark reproduction compared to the VHS version. It was almost impossible to see the opening scene on this DVD . It was as if this was done to reduce some viewers reaction to some of the scenes. This is one of my favourite movies and would normally rate a 5 star rating but I downgraded it because some of the scenes were much too dark.
3,More appropriate for opera buffs,"I had to force myself to watch the movie to the end. I didn't understand 90% of the dialogue; the characters spoke some sort of pseudo-Frenglish which I just couldn't decode. I speak English and French well, and I have no problem understanding other movies' dialogs in either language, so I don't think the problem was with my comprehensive abilities here.The directing draws strongly on opera elements. To me, such archaic opera airs looked, frankly, as silly as the screaming Korean grandpa-narrator in the movie Chunyang, (and it's a classically trained musician saying this). If you have an affinity towards opera, maybe they won't bother you as much.The essence of art is to convey the most meaning with the least resources. This movie communicated very little to me (beyond the basic story), using a lot of resources - the exact opposite. De Funes and Bunuel, where are you when we need you?"
2,Simply Not That Good,"I am being generous giving this film 2 stars. And no, it has nothing to do with being squeamish, or because it isn't a mainstream Hollywood popcorn film. I love challenging films. This just happens to not be one of them.Yes, the art direction is great. Yes the director of photography did a good job. But who cares? The overall effect is utterly pretentious. Why? Because the whole shooting concept overpowers an ultimately weak script. In order to pull-off the retro-concept of a taut drama unfolding amidst a minimum of sets, you have to have a very good story. Nudity, cannibalism and overly stylized dolley shots tracking endlessly from room to room just isn't enough to keep a person interested for a few hours. You need to be given a reason to give a damn.Since I mentioned cannibalism, let's not forget that the big pay-off of this film (where the cast eats the bad guy)was already done by John Waters in Desperate Living, and years earlier."
4,"(Region 2) No Special Features, but a Nice Looking Picture","The Region 2 DVD. The picture quality is identical to the Region 1 version; very good but I'm sure it would benefit from a new high definition transfer if someone like Criterion ever got their hands on the rights. But as I said, the picture on this disc is still very good, with sound to match. There are no special features, not even a Trailer. If you have a multi-region player (or are able to convert your Region 1 to Region 0 as I did) then there is absolutely no reason to spend $75+ on the OOP Anchor Bay Edition. Also, this is the 125 Minute Director's Cut, NOT the heavily edited Rated R (98 Minute) Version. Oh yeah, this is a Great Film!"
5,A real work of art - shame few will ever see it,I saw this film in a small neighborhood theatre in North London when it opened. It was enthusiastically received. I saw it again years ago on VHS. I am greatly disappointed that my favorite Peter Greenway film will join the lost set of films never to make it to digital. I notice that another (Prospero's Dream) will never be released either. Is Peter Greenway blocking transfer of his films?This film is a delightful satire. The backgrounds in this film show Greenway's experience as an oil painter. The director continually shows us that we are on a sound stage and that what is happening is a play of sorts.
1,Why bother?,"I pride myself on having a black sense of humor, and when a friend whose taste I trust raved about ""The Cook, The Thief, etc"", I went along willingly. The opening segments were dark and scatalogical, and I thought I was in for a treat. Wrong-O! A pointless and perverse plot made me wish I'd gone to see something interesting, like ""Our Friend, Mildew"" or ""The Wit and Wisdom of Attorney General John Mitchell"". In a climactic finish to the film, when the writer & director could used suspense, and hinted at the finish, they instead smash the viewer over the head. Of the 5 people I saw this film with, only 2 were around at the end. My friend said afterwards, ""I'm sorry you didn't like the movie."" I replied, ""I'm sorry you did."" I'll put it this way, this is not nearly as much fun as ""Killing Fields""."
4,"about the title..the cook, the thief, his wife and her lover....",Welcome to the world of barbaric style of movie which the story is basically about how a handsome looking man keep finding woman to have sexual relationship in the kitchen hiding behind curtains (behind the room which held big feast occasions) whom he later have sexual relationship with one of the tyrant's wife where he later found out the problem and get him killed. He is asked to use a folk and a knife to cut his flesh and eat which he was later shot to dead. What I can say is that this is the best kitchen around the world that can cater differnt activities inside. No longer why our kitchen are getting smaller these modern days due to things been exposed. Hmm...a second thought..
1,I wish I could un-see this movie,"I saw this when it came out, years ago. I adore Helen Mirren, but I didn't enjoy this movie. The style of the movie gets in the way of the story and the story is as gross as gluttony. The style is art house gone overboard. One room is entirely red, the next is completely white, etc. The unsavory elements include book eating and cannibalism-for-revenge. If you enjoy Helen Mirren, I suggest Prime Suspect instead."
1,"Grotesque, soulless and brainless","Well, on the pros side, this movie is visually lush and highly stylized. That, however is rather superficially accomplished and is not enough to carry a movie. It does, however deal with a parade of grotesque behavior carried out by soulless and uncompelling characters - it is unconvincing, surreal and stupid. If you think that films that are weird and shocking are ""brilliant"" just for being that, then you may like like this one, but if you prefer a brain to accompany perversion, then skip this waste of celluloid."
1,Torture for art's sake???,"This over the top art flick makes some snobby reference to the emerging middle class into money and power. Apparently in England that is a bad thing. This country has a branch of government (the house of lords) that only requires you are born of certain families and you get to write laws that affect everyone ELSE. Anyway the director and writer is an ARTIST so he is above it all apparently and he has a self made man portrayed as a brute, criminal and torturer. That's what happens when you are not born from the proper noble stock. The worlds biggest fashion victim designer Jean Paul Gaultier is responsible for the costumes and the talented actors involved in this joke hopefully fired their agents by now. Call me too sensitive but I don't enjoy watching a 10 year old boy get slowly stabbed in the stomach nor am I a big fan of torture for arts sake."
5,Beautiful,"Peter Greenaway's The Cook, The Thief, His Wife And Her Lover is one of the most beautiful films I have ever seen. The great tragedy about cinema today is that the beauty of sex is demonized while glamorous violence is embraced. You can watch James Bond shoot down waves of men and fondle young women and rent it at any ..video.. outlet, yet this film, where sex and nudity are beautiful, is denied the wide spreed release it rightfuly deserves. They had the audacity to release a censored version (now that is offensive). As of this writing the film is currently unavailable. Yet now comes news that the film will be released in a new remastered, uncut, widescreen version by Anchor Bay Entertainment. Great!"
3,Definitely not for the faint of heart,"If you are a fan of films as art, then you will probably appreciate this film. Whether you will enjoy it or not, however, is another matter. I was enthralled and haunted by the story, while being dazzled by the glorious imagery. The costumes (by Jean-Paul Gauthier) are magnificently done, and I agree with the other reviews about the cinematography. The combination of food and eroticism works well, even when the story turns bad. The story would not leave me for days, and the final image of the lover is one that I wish I could forget. If you're a fan of the art of cinema, by all means see it. You might want to skip lunch, though."
2,Never got it,I canceled the order because it only came in streaming and I don't have a blu-ray player so I have not seen the movie.
5,Great price,"DVD in very good quality. Sent item very fast, good communication. Would do business again without hesitation."
1,What a bizarre waste of time,"Churned my stomach, and just generally freaked me out - and NOT in the good scary movie kind of way."
3,"a disturbing, yet intriguing movie.","Watching this movie was quite an experience! Micheal Gambon'scharacter is probably the most evil character I've seen in anymovie! What his character does to other people in the movie isquite frightening, especially after he founds out his wife hasbeen cheating on him. I found several scenes very hard to sitthrough, especially the scene where he kills his wife's lover.This certainly is a hard movie to shake off; it stays with you,whether you want it to or not! The last scene really makes themovie! Helen Mirren is very sexy in this film. If I realizedwhat a gorgeous body she had, I would've asked her out one a dateyears ago!I watched the R-rated version before I watched the NC-17 oneand I'm amazed at how much they cut out and WHAT they cut out,which was alot of the full frontal nudity scenes! Interestingthat they kept all the violent scenes in it!Anyhow, I recommend the film, but only to those people who havevery strong stomachs!!"
2,WHAT ART?,"I read the theme. Sounded interesting. I rented. I was disgusted.This shallow wannabe flick with a highly predictable tale of adultery opens with a scene that has a man stripped to his tee, smeared all over with dog excrement, and even having it shoved down his throat. Which, as you may imagine, has nothing to do with the rest of the movie.The sole intent of the director seems to have been to constantly bombard the audience with horrendous characters (the thief), sickening imagery (some very likable characters are tortured, maimed or killed), characters being degraded in sickening ways, and as a cherry on the terrible cake, a bite of cannabilism.The production values of the movie are pretty good, so it's kind of sad to see them squandered on such a vile, grotesque story. Reviewers at Amazon seem to have taken the good camerawork as a conduit to say, ""This is ART!""No, it isn't. It's just grossness for grossness' sake. Oh, and it's gross. Don't see it on a full stomach, if you do at all."
2,Better anime of this type,"If you're looking for a ""harem"" anime, try Love Hina [or Magister Negi Magi when it comes out in the US]. If you're looking for fan service with a plot, try Maburaho or PoPoTan. I bought an import version of Girls Bravo 1 and 2, and gave it to my niece. Not that it's bad, but there is nothing memorable or touching. Even the above fan service anime have moments when you feel some emotion. A few weeks after seeing this anime, I can barely recall any scenes."
1,Uncritical and prejudicial,"Extreemely prjudicial view is projected in this book, unscholarly and nonfactual. Waste of time to read it.Books like this one make trees cry"
4,frame pump,This is my second Master Blaster pump. This one has one improvement over the old pump. The old pump had a metal ring that helped to clip the pump together when not being used so that it wouldn't extend. The clip became stretched and quit working on the old pump. The new one does away with the metal clip and the pump is secure in the bracket.One drawback with the new pump is it doesn't come with the tire tools that came with the old Master Blaster. The tire tools fit on the old pump and were handy when it came time to change a flat tire. That is the only draw back to the new pump (not having the tire tools come with it). The tire tools are cheap enough to buy separately though.
3,Bicycle Pump,"The pump is okay. It pumps air which is all that I needed. Nothing special about it, but it does work"
2,Bulky and Hard To Use,"I have a Blackburn pump and thought this one that is rated to 160 PSI would be better, it is NOT- I found it bulky and hard to use.I could not keep the nozzle attached to the tire nozzle. It would not fit my tandem without getting in the way of the peddle."
1,Don't waste your money,"I bought this on Amazon based on the low price and good reviews. The movie is terrible. It is not a nice Christmas special. It is very slow moving, the animation is terrible and the story makes no sense. It could have been cute, but too many strange plot lines make it long and meandering and rather creepy at times. It really deserves no stars at all, but that is not a choice. Even the songs were terrible!"
4,What Performances!,"Julie Harris stars as Frankie, a 12 year old girl trying to figure out where she fits in. Rejected by her peer group, she decides she will join her brother and his future bride on their honeymoon and go with them forever. The family housekeeper, Bernice, played by Ethel Waters, tries to convince her otherwise, but Frankie is strong willed and won't be deterred. Julie Harris gives an intense, painfully honest performance as the struggling adolescent, hitting all the emotional peaks and valleys with such feeling and truth. As Frankie's pseudo-mother, Waters is equally impressive, delivering a charismatic, deeply felt performance that provides the film's emotional centre. The film definitely betrays its stage origins, with a lot of dialogue and little change in scene or action. The film is about characters and the human drama, and although it's hardly uplifting, anyone who can remember the feelings of their youth and wanting to fit in, will understand what it is trying to say."
4,Queen of the dollar store karate movies,"Both movies in the set are actually quite entertaining. Some of the comedy is ridiculous, and the lines confusing, but the action is surprisingly good, and Nora Kao Loa is not only a fantastic martial artist, but pretty easy on the eyes as well. ^_^Is it a classic? Definitely not, but if you can find this set for cheap, I'd say it's worth getting."
4,Not excited about this book.,"While this is not a bad book, It's not a good one either. It is designed to make shamanism palatable to the vast public. It delivers the message that shamanism is something that people can practice with a minimal engagement. Picture those TV programs that teach ""how to drop weight while preparing breakfast"", and you'll have a good idea of what I mean. Nothing wrong with it. Just know what you are buying."
5,Nice Meditations and Visualizations,"I really enjoy the meditations and visualizations contained in this book, it's the kind you don't usually find anywhere and they're very powerful.I would have preferred it in a trade paperback size or larger instead of its pocketbook size; there's too much important info in this book for such small packaging.You may also like to tryAnimal Speak: The Spiritual & Magical Powers of Creatures Great & Small"
4,Secrets of Shamanism: Tapping the Spirit Power Within You,"Interesting, but doesn't match my physical and menthal condition. These excesises break the balance of tension and relaxation in my body, and I become more self-content and less of service to others. However, the experience with shaman jorneys cast another light on that. Everything envisioned seems true!"
1,fluffy and generic,"This book uses the word ""shaman"" the way many of us use the words ""Kleenex"" or ""Xerox"".There are no ""secrets"" in this book. Its just very vague in a ""new age feel good"" kinda way. The lessons are contrived and the exercises to try at home are quite useless.This book has NOTHING to do with Native American Tribal Spirituality.Native Americans do not use the word Shaman. Each tribe has a different set of beliefs and practices.They only teach their spirituality orally, not in books. Please keep that in mind.I have studied paganism, neo- paganism of all sorts. I have a library at home of over 500 books and this is the only one that disappointed me so much i actually considered asking for my money back."
5,The Hurting Partent,"This book helped me to retain (or regain!) a level of rational thinking at a time when there was nothing rational in my personal life. All three of my beloved children were out of control and our family life was in chaos. One child was into drugs, one was into alcohol, and one was trying to cope with severe trauma. I was on a guilt trip that threatened to engulph me, and it seemed like I had slipped into a deep black pit with slippery walls. The entire world seemed black to me. One of the strongest helps I received was The Hurting Parent. The various topics seemed to address my pain - - even the topics that did not apply to my situation. Since then I have bought several copies of this book, and then loaned them out. They don't seem to come back, so the people I have given them to must consider them helpful in their lives, too. Thank you Margie Lewis & son!"
1,An attempt at passing Barney Theology off as Christian Theology,"Any parent who possesses any concern for biblical fidelity should not bother with this book. It encourages the acceptance of sinful behavior on the part of Christians upon absolutely no biblical basis. As Christians, we are called to deal differently with professing Christians when they willingly sin than in the way we deal with non Christians. At its best, this book is an example of bad Sunday School teaching and at its worst is an attempt at passing off Barney Theology as Christian...the only thing missing is the purple dinosaur and that irritating theme song."
3,A timeless classic,A rare and intriguing part of the Wizard of Oz 1999 Mattel set.Any girl who has seen the film will want one to enhance her bedroom.
5,Ken as Cowardly Lion from the Wizard of Oz,"Calling all Wizard of Oz lovers! This doll is a wonderful addition to any Wizard of Oz collector. It is very durable. I've had the Lion Barbie for nearly two years and there is very little wear and tear. I love this doll because I love Wizard of Oz. It is extremely fun, especially when played with Dorothy, Scarecrow, Tinman, Glinda, the Lulaby league, the Lollypop Guild, and the Mayor. You better act quickly on this item, as it is sure to be sold out quickly."
2,Shipping Gold..???,I spent $15.00 on (2) pans and they charged me $14.75 shipping and when I called them they seemed pretty indifferent.. NO THANX..
5,Wonderful lullabye music for baby and parent,"I love this CD. When I rock my grandson to sleep with this music playing, I am ready to sleep as well. It stills my heart and makes me smile as the words are so sweet. Love it. My grandson starts falling off on the first song after playing this for a while. I am fighting not falling asleep:)"
2,Healing anxiety and Depression,"Was rather disappointed with these CD's, and would return them if it were possible, as they sounded more likely a commercial promoting the Amen Clinic, and not very helpful at all."
5,Truth in Diagnosis and Treatment,"Dr. Amen has once again given us the means to help our patients understand why they feel the way they do. When we understand the why we can then figure out the treatment plan without trial and error. It is time for patients to be given the tools to help them live productive lives free of stigma and pain. Thanks, Dr. Amen for all your hard work - the world can be a better place thanks to your research if only we can get more physicians to listen and learn."
2,Wrongly Marketed Product,"The information it provides is great for Psychiatrists and professionals, but not for regular people. In no way does it teach to hear anxiety or depression, it only talks about it and how it relates to MRI and other imaging results. This product isn't for the ""people"" in any way."
1,Cheap advertisement for the Amen Clinic,"The book reads like a pamphlet advertising the Amen Clinics. At the Amen Clinics this and at the Amen Clinics that, give me a break. This guy can't go half a page without tooting his own horn. You would think that everywhere except the Amen Clinics, the treatment of mental disorders is by witch doctors and alchemists. The books makes a big deal about the use of brain scanning and how this is such a big advantage for their clinic. They shame insurance companies for not reimbursing payment and other doctors for not using the technique, but read closely. In the end, they still the patients are still treated just like anywhere else, symptomatically. One word for this book: lame."
5,Astonishing,"Dr. Amen is definitely one of the best when it comes to mental illness. Having suffered from depression, and more severely, anxiety, I browsed through the health section at my local bookstore looking for answers. And I definitely found them in this book. This book talks about the 7 types of depression and anxiety, how they are caused, what brain chemicals are causing the symptoms and where in the brain the problem lies. Dr. Amen uses SPECT nuclear imaging to see the brain in its depressed/anxious states. Along with descriptions of all of the 7 types are images of the brain with that type of depression/anxiety. I narrowed down my depression/anxiety to be a type 4, followed the advice it suggested, and have been 90% depression and anxiety free for 6 months. A MUST read for anyone suffering from a mood or anxiety disorder."
5,Anxiety and Depression,Great Book. Really narrows down the possibilities for safe treatment of anxiety and depression. Exercise and diet help.
2,Better books out there.,"This book is not for the average person who wants to have a better understanding of depression. It is more for professionals who have already have a basic knowledge. ""The Depression Sourcebook"" by Brian Quinn is well written and easy to follow."
5,Good Information,I went to Dr. Amen's clinic this past November and had a wonderful experience. I really like all of his books.
3,Too much nature not enough nurture,I think Amen goes a little to far claiming to heal depression and anxiety. Althrough depression and anxiety have physical manifistations and treatments I think it is important to address the psycholgical cuases and issues that contribute to these problems.
3,"wrote a song about it, wanna hear it? Here it go","This book constantly points to seeking professional help and/or evaluation ... brain scans and whatnot. I thought the book was going to be something along the lines of self-help. NOT. Unless you want the book for research and/or academic purposes, save the dough for a `head shrinker fund'."
1,Not Healing for Me!,"not his best effort...poorly written and nothing new, as far as i was concerned, having read two of his other books. and really don't like the emphasis on anti-depressants. never felt like he got his point across, as being anything different from what i've read, i.e. depression and anxiety are caused in the brain...and tah dah...here are some meds for it. so what?"
5,Lot's of fun!,"Great characters, a fun storyline, and a little magic makes this a wonderful show. To add to that, the setting is also beautiful - both on land and under water. I have watched all three seasons, and have really enjoyed them all!"
4,An excellent and entertaing show for younger teenage girls,"I would highly reccomend this show to any teenage girl out there who likes clean drama with a twist to it. Honestly if the show didn't have the whole mermaid aspect to it, it would just be another boring teenage show that way overdoes the drama. But because the girls are mermaids, it keeps things just enough different and entertaining as to be worth the watch. Plus, the show gets better as the seasons progress, which I find is true about a lot of drama shows out there. So, all in all, definitley worth the watch."
2,bleh.,"My kids (3 girls under the age of 10) love this show. But the would watch ANYTHING on tv, if I let them. If you are not looking for much of a plot & like marginal acting skills, this one is for you!"
1,Great Series Though poorly Transcribed,"It appears to me that movies shown on ""Instant Video "" play satisfactory..... The shorter 30 minute or less video series' are pixelated and get blurry and even had voice track out of sinc at a few places ...I'll only buy Series If on dvd or even vhs .. . I'll end up with the entire H2O just add water , series .."
1,dry as dry could be,This book was very dry and difficult reading due to the fact the contents could not keep my attention. The 15 questions on the sergeants exam that pertained to this book were lengthy questions that were the demise of all test takers scores. Although everyone passed the exam all test takers complained about the 15 responsibility questions.
1,Boring and very outdated,I bought this book to take a promotional exam at work and I truly believe it's contents and it's authors inability to make it interesting was a big part of the downfall... He cites cases from the early 1900s. it's out dated and just completely boring. Not to mention sexist.
3,Very General,"This book was on the reading list for an upcoming promotion. While our agency is very small, I found that the items in this book were very, very general. There were lessons such as teaching which was broken down into many many different steps. I found that many topics could have been simplified and not elaborated. I also feel that this book should have focused more on Police work and not supervision in general. I thought this book focused more on supervision in Office type settings.There are some good points and aspects in the book however."
2,Don't pay for this book...,"Don't spend a dime...borrow it from a fellow Officer. I am a firm believer in capitalism, but these guys are really pushing the envelope. $99.00?! Nathan can keep the book!Is the content any good? Yes, it is solid, however basic, leadership for Police Officers. But $99.00?! Go read something by Covey...it is a hell of a lot cheaper and far less boring."
2,supervision of police personnel,Supervision of Police personnel (6th) edition by Iannone/Iannone was included in the reference materials for recent promotional exams for both Sgt. and Lt.. Urge your civil service commission not to use this book. The authors take a paragraph to say what could be said in one sentence. Every paragraph contains run on sentences which makes for laborious reading at best. If the authors would heed their own advice concerning brevity this book would easily be half as many pages. There are other books that cover the same subject and most do it better.
2,IANNONE-POLICE SUPERVISION,"THE BOOK ALTHOUGH SOMEWHAT INFORMATIVE IS LONG WINDED, BORING AND SEVERLY LACKING IN EXAMPLES. IT IS A HARD READ FOR EVEN THE MOST EDUCATED OF READER. IANNONE HAS MANAGED TO TAKE A 150 PAGE BOOK AND TRANSFORM IT INTO 360 LONG ARDUOUS PAGES."
3,Practice what you preach.,"I bought this book because our annual Sgt.'s exam would be taken from this text. While what Iannone covered was very important, his constant run on sentences made this text very difficult to read. Perhaps if Mr. Iannone would follow his own advice for instruction, avoiding oversimplification or overcomplication...then more people would retain the information contained in the book. Most of my fellow officers said that after reading a chapter, they had difficulty remembering what had been said. I had to go back to my old management books to get some of the basic ideas covered in Iannone's book."
2,Cliffs notes,Any one who has to read this book for a class or promotional exam; please call the Cliffs Notes company and ask them to write a Cliffs notes booklet for this book. The authors should take their own advice found on pg 83 and avoid aimlessness in the book.
1,Save your money,"While the book contained many viable concepts, the author(s) have trouble getting to the point. Frankly, I'm surprised it was ever published. Many examples are barrowed from dozens of books on corporate management, some of which are over 70 years old. They frequently devote 20 or more pages of verbs, adverbs and diatribe to summarize a single concept that could have been conveyed in one or two paragraphs. As an example, I encountered one sentence with over 80 words. No one talks like this. In real, usable language, this book could have been produced as a pamphlet, a guide.This book is frequently listed as required reading for those seeking promotion within Law Enforcement. After two readings, I still find the text wholly boorish and difficult to follow.Save your money. At $88.00 a copy, I feel like I need a cop..., to take a crime report for highway robbery."
2,Some good info... but rambling and poorly written,"This text is required reading for many taking police promotional exams. While there is some good information in it, it is rambling and poorly written. There are some indications that the book is not properly reviewed and edited before each new reprint. I hope the seventh edition is better and ties together the concepts clearly. There are several chapetes that are seperated but could easily dovetail into one. I found a 107 word run-on sentence (p.139), and it was by no means an exhaustive search -- there are many such examples. You can make it enjoyable to a degree by trying to find the number of times ""catharsis"" and ""splendid"" appear, but other than that, have your asprin bottle handy. I'd recommend a study guide such as Sgt. Walker recommends, or try to outline the thing yourself. Good luck."
3,"Ok headphones, but where is the sound quality?","Overall these headphones are ok, but they don't perform as well as other headphones within this price range. The clips aren't too bad and feel like the headphones should be pretty good when you put them on, however the sound that comes out of these is hardly what you would expect. The high end isn't very clean sounding and the bass struggles to come out despite the specs that these headphones have on paper. Overall, I suppose that if you just like the looks of the headphones then they might be right for you, but if you want sound quality the sony's look cool and sound good while the koss ksc-50 um, sounds good. :)"
3,Not as I expected...,I thought that the cord would be long enough but it's really short. I like the clip on and it didn't hurt my ears at all. The bad thing is that the sound quality is not that great. Reason is because it's loose on your ears and not snug fit. A lot of noise leaks out from this and sound quality also suffers. So all in all it's ok and isn't all that good.
3,OK,"These headphones look real neat. They were kinda hard to learn to put them on at first, but were easy after. These headphones are OK sound in the highs and lows. They have some leakage problems with the sound, becuase they aren't right up to your ears, but kinda hang. The bad part I do not like about this is that these headphones don't feel right when they are on. They just don't feel right, they don't feel like there even on, and if they did, feel like there gonna fall off. Overall this was an alright pair of headphones. ...."
4,Fun escape,"This book has some of my favorite story lines; sailing, marooned on an island, survival skills, and hand to hand combat. It is a fun, quick read. I read it in two days while home sick. If you are looking for a life changing, thought provoking book, or an accurate historical novel this is not it. However, if you are looking for a written form of escape with a story like you might find in some of our most popular current adventure movies, this is perfect for you."
5,UNBELIEVABLE shaver,"I have a very sensitive skin and I've been using electric shaver for the last 10-15 years. I tried a few models on the market and they were OK. When I read review for this shaver I thought, as usual, that it's another marketing trick. But since so many folks left such nice reviews I decided to give it a try.I want to tell you that I have NEVER EVER used anything designed and built so beautifully. I 100% agree that this shaver gives as close shave to the regular shaver as it can be. I think that Panasonic itself now is challenged to improve this product. Great product, great shaving experience. I don't have a single point of complaint. Thanks for the product."
4,Smooth Shaver,"Panasonic ES8077S Linear Pivot ShaverMy third Panasonic Linear shaver in 15 years. This one is the quietest yet. It also holds a charge longer than any previously owned models. I like the cleaner/dryer/charging dock. I only hope I get longer life from this product this time. It shaves as close as most electrics, especially in the wet mode."
4,Sharp enough to cut you like a blade,"This is a good product, quiet, close and very smooth. The only thing that I don't like is that the display flashes when charging. If left on the counter in the bathroom at night the flash will light up the hall. Buy the same unit without the fancy display, save some money and you don't have to deal with the display!!!"
5,Incredible,"I've never liked these cordless razors, my fathers norelco years and years ago would shave you but i always thought of it as more of a trimmer than an actual shave compared to a regular razor shave.Recently though due to my schedule i have been increasingly busy and thought i would give one of these a shot in case i ever needed a quick shave in the car.This device is incredible, not only is this the lexus of shavers, it shaved me so damn close that my shave looks as if i had wet shaved with shaving cream and a razor, and this was dry, so i can imagine that a wet shave with a little lather would be incredibly smooth! As it is, the first time i used it, it did leave my face incredibly smooth!I was unsure when i bought this if it was worth the price, but believe me, this shaver is not your fathers old shaver. This thing is perfect, and to top it all off, it even cleans, charges, and dry's itself! Perfect!10 out of 10.I just hope it lasts."
5,A Fantastic Shaving System,"Have owned this razor system for about two weeks. It really DOES THE JOB !!! When used with shaving cream, it provides a very smooth shave. When used in the dry mode, the shave is very good. I have a very tough, fast growing beard, and I really enjoy using this razor.Clean-up is a breeze. Everything is done automatic, and the razor is fresh and clean, for the next use.There is nothing like this! I usually buy a new electric razor every two-years,and they do a horrible job.The detergent will last up to 40 days, so it is realatively inexpensive to use. The motor is not loud.The razor certainly justifies the price, over the long haul. The razor and unit are very sturdy and should last for a long time."
4,Good saver but not Great shaver.,"Purchased the Panasonic to replace my Braun 7000 series. The Panasonic was a great shaver when the blade was sharp. The blade lasted 6 months, if that. Put a new blade in the Braun, gave the Panasonic to my son."
5,Excellent electric razor on the market,"I went through several reviews and comparisons with Braun 360 and Norelco latest shaver before finalizing on the Panasonic vortex. I am really glad that I decided on this one. The looks are great. It is very lightweight, ergonomic. Nise level is acceptable, not loud or disturbing. The swivel head really helps around the chin edges. It shaves as good or better than the Mach-3 razor that I was using before. Battery life is excellent. I use it as a dry shaver once every two days and use 10% of the charge in each shave. So the charge last for 15 days. Cleaning is very easy. It can be cleaned with the regular hand liquid soap or the cleaning system that comes along with it can be used. I use the system once or twice a month and it does a nice job. Overall very satisfied and would definitely recommend to buy if considering for an electric shaver."
3,razor review,"I became tired of the never ending tries against various norelco shavers, which functioned the same way, and only differentiated themselves in styleWanted to try something new so read reviews and went with the Panasonic... i do find that i get a closer shave ... but it takes a while and as another reviewer mentioned is noisyWorks better wet than dry !"
2,Disappointed,"I've been using Panasonic wet/dry shavers for more than 10 years and this is one of the worst models for wet shaving yet. For some reason, the last few models of Panasonic shavers that I've had just haven't held up to wet shaving the way they should. I haven't given up yet on Panasonic, but I'm close."
2,Not That Good,"I looked at all of the reviews and thought this was going to finally pull me away from Braun. Sadly, no. The cleaning system is useless since it doesnt wash away the clippings, my system just kept them on top of the shaver head once the process completed the shave was ok nothing spectacular as many of the reviewers would have you believe. It was worth a shot, maybe I got a bad one I dunno, back to Braun it is."
5,Moved me Greatly! A must read .Gets u closer to God.,"I was greatly moved by reading this discussion between Larry King and Rabbi Katsof. It will help the novice prayer or the advanced grow in their relationship with G-d. It is fast paced ,funny,easy going. Hard to put down. It lifted me up and made me decide to become more real in my interactions with G-d. I highly reccomend it for anyone who wants to become closer to the Almighty."
4,"Impacting, Interesting, for the mind.","This books to me was more interesting than ""powerful"" only because I am on the journey intended for me. I feel a reader who is seeking a stronger relationship to prayer can view this books as ""powerful"". I would recommend this book to others."
4,good sound quality,"i ordered this earphone because i needed $5 more to use a coupon. this one is pretty good. the sound quality is great. i like the small case, but earphone looks a little old-fashioned."
5,Frog Parking Only Sign,This made a fantastic Christmas gift. She loves frogs and this really put a smile on here face. It came very promptly was good quality and the price was right. A fairly good size too I might add. I recommend this seller and their items any day. Thanks again.
5,Great Service,"The product arrived so quickly. Unfortunately, the product had a small defect and when I called the company, they sent another item right away. I received the replacement so quickly as well. In fact, I got both items in the time that they said I would have received the first. Great customer service and great product. Thank you! It will be a fun gift for my end of year celebration with my students. We use FROG to mean For Recognition of Greatness :)"
5,FROG PARKING,FROG PARKING. The sign arrived well before expected and was in great shape. It was a hit at Christmas with my wife..
4,"Interesting story...the editing, however, left alot to be desired!","Enjoyed reading her life story, was distracted by the spelling errors. Would have liked to edit the book for her! Anyone know how to contact Miss Paige?"
4,Great lil Camera..,My buddy took some video with this camera and it looks really good.. its small affordable and gets the job done..
3,JVC GRAX750U Palm Size Compact VHS Camcorder,The JVC camcorder is good but when you use the cassettes directly in VCR it's giving some sort of troubles the view is not good. When we watching using camcorder it's viewing littile bit good.
2,"A good start, but incomplete","This book seems like a good idea. It does contain a good amount of information about starting a business, but a lot of it is toward starting a business in general, rather than about a claims/transcription business, in particular. It deals a lot with manufacturing, for instance, but not so much with service, which would be this type of business. It seems to me that this is a realistic business to start, but you'll need more than this book to do it."
3,"Vague on Medical Claims Billing/Transcription, but valuable for starting a business in general.","After much anticipation, I received my Start Your Own Medical Claims and Transcription Business book; however, I was sort of disappointed. The aspects of starting a business was outlined beautifully, but what this book was missing was the information that was stated on the title. There are little references throughout the book that go into some detail about medical claims and transcription, but failed to go into any major detail. The money that I spent was not a total loss, there were some very good points in the book. For the money, it is worth it, but do not think that after reading it that you will be ready to quit your day job and start your own."
4,You want to end like this?,"Good novel, well put together, but why end like this? With the greatness that Vonnegut had this novel is not up to par. The work he did in The Sirens of Titan was amazing, but he is not going to end like this, is he? Timequake was good. It had a good autobiographical nature to it, parts were excelent, but the old man trying to give something else to the publisher came out too much. This is a book to read while you concentrate on another, not one to put too much time, or thought, into. Fun in places but not top quality Vonnegut."
2,Don't judge a book by its title - this one doesn't deliver,"I found ""Timequake"" a disappointment. I ordered it because I found the thought of a real ""Timequake"" an absolutely fascinating idea for a plot. To have to relive 10 years of our lives! However, that's not what this book is about. It's a series of loose reminiscing that at times can be humorous, but for the most part is nothing but a giant tease. There's no meat to this book... I kept waiting for the plot to develop, and it didn't. Perhaps if it had been called ""The Recollections and Musings of Kurt Vonnegut,"" I'd have been less disappointed, for the book would have lived up to its billing. As they say, don't judge a book by its cover - or its title."
3,Time gets unstuck in New York City,"Kilgore Trout is here, now; and then. Which makes this an above average novel. Vonnegut is here once in a while, every now and then. Which is interesting, but sad. If you love Vonnegut you have to read it. It'll take a night. If you don't: ""Billy Pilgrim got unstuck in time"" is a better exposition of the concepts here, and it's only one sentence long."
3,The life and ramblings of Kurt Vonnegut,"My introduction to Kurt Vonnegut was through a well-worn copy of ""Breakfast of Champions"", picked up for 15 cents at the Vincent de Paul Store. What a terrific web-of-life type story. As I read ""Timequake"", I realized immediately that most of the pro reviewers didn't read the book--""Timequake"" is simply not the book described on the back of its cover. If you want to read a Vonnegut novel, read ""Breakfast of Champions"". If you want to find out more about Vonnegut the man, read ""Timequake"". If ""Timequake"" is the first Vonnegut book you read, you'll be sorely disappointed."
3,Earthquake aftermath,"Vonnegut doesn't know whether he wants his final, puzzlingly structured book to be novel or autobiography; the main narrative is original and perceptive, typical of Vonnegut, but the book's too littered with anecdotes and the author's life details -- which are not only irrelevant, but are often ones we've read before in Fates Worse than Death and other sources. But much of the humour still works, in the usual audacious Vonnegut style: ""Dog's Breakfast"" is a gem, as are most Kilgore Trout stories."
5,One of Vonnegut's best,"Who cares about a relative lack of plot; Vonnegut doesn't need any such flimsy devices to be brilliant, whimsical and wise"
2,I won't read it twice!,"Boring. I didn't enjoy reading this. Just kept hoping the ""funny"" part would start on the next page, but it never did. I can't believe he got paid to write this .... It's as if he pulled out all of the scraps from his garbage and stuck them in a book. PLEASE don't waste your time on this, when there is so much great writing to be found elsewhere. I recommend David Sedaris."
3,Cosmic Author Rip-Off,"Readers may be interested to learn that in chapter 63 of ""Timequake"" a speech given to the character Kilgore Trout (Vonnegut's parody version of Theodore Sturgeon) was clearly borrowed from Chapter 29 of Sturgeon's 1958 novella ""To Marry Medusa"" - a meditation on how the human eye and mind can travel from star to star faster than light."
1,STAMP: Return to Writer,"Vonnegut's 19th, and allegedly last, novel is a mish-mash only diehard Vonnegut fans are likely to appreciate. There are all kinds of semi-autobiographical musings here, mixed in with the remnants of a failed novel. I lost interest a quarter of the way through and tossed it aside."
1,Hopefully the end,"Mr. Vonnegut I sincerely hope you choose not to write again. After wading through the trash you concocted out of 26 letters on horizontal rows with maybe eight punctuation marks I was thoroughly nauseated. How could you assemble such a meaningless, meandering, mumble, and release it to the public with good conscience. If this is 'the good version' I would have really hated to see the first one. I'm a giant Vonnegut fan. And I've loved nearly all of his work I've come in contact with to this point. If you're a dedicated fan then I guess it's your duty to read this, this pile. If not, start with some of his earlier work. And save yourself the trouble."
4,Goodbye Mr V.,"Kurt is in heaven with Isaac Asimov right now, laughing about our stubborn attempts to kill ourselves with our actions, once and once again. ""Timequake"" is not the best book that Vonnegut wrote, and is not by all means a perfectly crafted narrative. But is the way by which Kurt said goodbye to many of us, to write about his tastes (I watched ""My Year as a Dog"" this week, and is indeed wondrous) and his family, the people that made him this way, and the randomness of his life career as if somebody had designed it. But it is not, we know, it is simply randomness and making the best we can of it. By the end, when Kilgore Trout was acting his part in a play with Vonnegut at his side, I was almost crying while reading on a bus on the way back home. Goodbye, Kurt, we will miss you."
1,Sorry Kurt... I suggest reading something else,"Sorry Kurt. It is painful that the author of such incredibly wonderful books as Slaughterhouse-Five and Breakfast of Champions wrote something like this. It is a challenge to stop publishing when you stop having something creative and interesting to write. Unfortunately, Vonnegut did not meet this challenge. This book was published and how many people will buy and read it like I did to find that it is a waste of ink.I recommend reading something else by Vonnegut before reading this. For that matter, I recommend reading anything by anybody before reading this. Sorry for the bad news. I was sorry I wasted the time going through it hoping it would get better."
5,It&#65533;s Back to the Vonnegut We Like,"Yep, five stars. So it rambles. So there isn't much plot. Vonnegut's comments on everything in this world he chooses to address (including himself) always struck me as about as perceptive as could be dared without causing widespread anarchy. How about his assertion that, while many folks think communism is wrong because it redistributes wealth, heck, hasn't wealth already been redistributed by the rich??? Along those lines he singles out Robin Hood and Jesus Christ as two of the most insidious characters in history, neither of whom interestingly is banned from our libraries. He's just full of it, ain't he? None of this has anything to do with the ostensible plot. But that's okay, Kurt. Keep the one-liners rolling. And it's great to see Kilgore Trout back in the trenches. I haven't had so much fun with a Vonnegut book since ""Breakfast of Champions."" Encore, encore!"
1,The First Vonnegut Book I Didn't Finish,"Vonnegut seems to have lost the ability to juggle multiple narratives the way he once did so masterfully (see ""The Sirens of Titan""). The result is a mishmash.He mourns the death of the short story as a literary form and gives that as his justification for the device of inserting his ideas for short stories into his novels. I've always enjoyed that device.But this is what happens when you take a short story (or more accurately, the bits and pieces of a short story) and mix it in a salad bowl with other ideas for a short story, along with some family reminiscences and your general cranky views of life. It starts nowhere, goes nowhere, and although I gave up on it about 3/4 of the way through, I'll bet my next paycheck that it arrives nowhere.If you decide to read this mess anyway, ask yourself what would have happened to the manuscript if it had originally arrived on a publisher's desk with your name on it instead of Vonnegut's."
5,His best book hands down,"In this book, Vonnegut explores free will in a dark and humorous way that only he can. This may be a difficult read for many people, but it is well worth the effort. In fact, make sure you have a highlighter on hand as your read it, so you can go back later and find those wonderful nuggets of insight sprinkled throughout. As far as I am concerned, this is Vonnegut's best book."
1,What kind of Book is this?,When I bought this book I was expecting a science fiction novel. I think this book is just a bunch of random paragraphs and chapters that are thrown together and make no sense. I did not even finish reading it since I couldn't make any sense of it. I don't recomend this book.
1,When is this rousseauist naif gonna shut up?,"Easily the worst fic since ... oh ... I'd have to go back to KID ANDREW CODY & JULIE SPARROW by Hollywood-legend Tony Curtis. There's one good quote: ""Chicago is a better city than New York because Chicago has alleys. The garbage doesn't pile up on the sidewalks. Delivery vehicles don't block main thoroughfares."""
5,Kurt says Goodbye,"Vonnegut rambles like he always does and you immediately feel at home. The book reads like any of his novels and yet, somewhere deep down, it feels like the last one. I hope I'm wrong."
4,what if,"...and just what would happen if we had to repeat the 1970s all over again. And couldn't change a thing. Would we really want to change anything, or could we bear to do it all over again.That is what is asked, and how much does free will really enter the picture....Vintage Vonnegut, on a lighter existential diet..."
5,Another superlative effort from a fantastic author,"I've reviewed this masterwork by one of America's greatest authors before. I just wanted to see how one of his later classics stacked up against one of his earlier classics. They're both fantastic. In his later career, he started recycling ideas, and nobody cared because they're such excellent ideas. But if you compare this to SLAUGHTERHOUSE FIVE, there's not much repetition at all. I bet you can find this one in your library as well, and that you'll thank me again."
4,A piquant farewell to a treasured friend,"I have mixed emotions about Vonnegut's newest and, as he says himself, last novel. In it he states that what we are reading is actually a rewrite of his original that is referred to as ""Timequake 1"". After finding that TQ1 ""didn't work"", he decided to scrap most of it in favor of a memoir/novel/ essay that would be his answer to a sports hero's final season.I live in Chicago, and I'll mourn Michal Jordan's retirement much less than this old friend's, whom I've invited into my home time and again over the decades. I only hope that he'll change his mind and maybe even give us a chance to decide for ourselves the merits of Timequake 1, and that perhaps he'll throw a collection of short stories our way. I just finished the book, autographed at a recent signing here; and now feel that a friend has left forever. That is why I gave the book a mediocre rating, 'cause ""I feel like something the cat drug in"". Ray Schmitz III"
4,"Excellent, surprisingly solid.","I am in such admiration of Kurt Vonnegut with the publication of this book. I have never heard any artist, writer, or musician acknowledge that they knew full well they were out of their prime, until reading Timequake. Surely the only way to avoid drying up and being pigeonholed as a an old washed up fart is to write a book like this: to break up what certainly would have made a bad novel into a part essay, part memoir, part jokebook. Simply to write what he wanted to. If he had written the novel, it would have sucked, we know it and he does too. What we have instead is something much more rewarding and much more relevant to Vonnegut's lifework. Very well done, very hilarious, and very brave. I know very well that the worst art in the world is done by artists out of their heyday, but Vonnegut has somehow sidestepped this scar. Wow? Yes."
3,Vonnegut fans must read. Others may pass.,"A combination retrospective and fictitious book. As a long time fan of Vonnegut and all his books, I enjoyed reading about his life experiences. For a riveting story, read Breakfast of Champions or Slaughterhouse 5. This is a final farewell to Hard Core Vonnegut fans, really."
2,What happened to Vonnegut?,"What happed to the Kurt Vonnegut of Cat's Cradle, Mother Night and Hocus Pocus. Starting out the book was a struggle to read...due to extreme boredom. It did get better by the end, but not much. Even Kurt Vonnegut said the origial book 'Timequake"" wasn't to his liking so he took the best parts and strung them together, quite haphazardly I might add, and we got this book...Timequake 2 so to speak. It is certainly a let down that Vonnegut would choose to end such a great writting career with such a poor effort. What happened?"
4,Another cool Vonnegut book.,"I have read almost all of Vonnegut's books, and he is pretty much all I've read for the last 2 years. I have loved them all to varying degrees, and this one is an extraordinary book like all the others. A freaking excellent book.""You like Vonnegut?"" ""Damn straight I like Vonnegut."" ""Then read some more Vonnegut.""It's simple: He doesn't disappoint. He even reveals in the book that he hates semicolons! Do you need to know any more than that to want to read this book? I think not.Rock on, Mr. Vonnegut!"
4,vonnegut's last stand,"He finally wrote the autobiography he said he'd never write. As he did with ""Breakfast of Champions"" Vonnegut has created a new literary style- the ""Bio-Novel"". This book is definitely skewed toward Vonnegut freaks like myself; casual fans may not quite get it."
2,incoherent and morose,"There definitely are a few good plot lines scattered throughout this book, especially the short stories that Kilgore writes. As a whole though the book is disappointing and a bit morose. It certainly isn't science fiction and it isn't exactly a memoir either. It's more like an old man kvetching about how life sucks and all of his deceased loved ones are better off in the grave. What a downer!"
4,"Farewell, sweet prince of sarcasm","Well, it's over. An author's career unlike any other has finally run its course and I couldn't be more depressed. Kurt Vonnegut is an American icon to all of those (myself included) to whom the postmodern world ""just doesn't make sense."" I'm only 18, and still in my ""salad days"" to quote the master himself, but I am thankful that an author like Vonnegut came forth for the annals of history. May we all live our lives with more sanity simply knowing that there's someone out there like Vonnegut, someone who stops and asks himself incessanly, ""What the hell is going on here?"" If this isn't nice, I don't know what is."
2,Disappointing,"Vonnegut's still is a great rhetorician: he has a great voice. Unfortunately, he wouldn't know a plot if he stumbled over it. And what used to be charming is now cranky, whining, and half-baked. Stick with Cat's Cradle and Slaughterhouse Five."
4,"""If this isn't nice, what is?""","Read this book! I've read every one of Mr. Vonnegut's books. My first, Slaughterhouse Five hooked me; (sorry about the semi-colon) I've been a fan ever since. ""Timequake"" is special, especially if it is truly his last novel. I hope it isn't. Books, his much more so than other's, ""help us to get through this thing, whatever it is."" MR VONNEGUT: I know you don't listen to critics, but listen up: I hope the tiny receiver in your brain begins picking up creative signals again, soon! Try this on for size: ""You've been sick, but now you're well again, and there's work to do."""
1,Grateful to be alive...,"I listened to this audiobook on a long drive...and I'm greatful to be alive, but probably not in the sense you'd expect. Between road hypnosis and the drone of this book, I nearly fell asleep more than once. Disjointed, self-indulgent musings about family, life, death, religion and (oh yeah) the self-proclaimed not-good-enough-to-publish Timequake storyline make for a day at the insane asylum. If you into self-flagellation and you enjoy going to visit 80 year-old uncles who are happy to blather on in stream of consciousness while you're bound and gagged and bored silly, then this is the book for you. Attracted by the title, this was my first foray into Vonnegut and I was monumentally disappointed. It will be hard to pick up his other titles without the taste of this one in my mouth. Spit."
4,Possibly my favorite Vonnegut book,"""Timequake"" does something that few books can do for me: it makes me think about life. Screw ""plot"" and ""characterization"" and all that crap. If I want a dumb story I'll go see a crappy Hollywood movie. This book is meat and potatoes: it's some of the author's philosophy presented very in a very simple, straight-forward style-- yes, the ramblings of a wise old man near the end of his life. Great stuff. Non-thinkers need not apply."
2,Not so Hot,"It has been my experience that when you are reading Vonnegut lit, you have either picked up a hit or a miss. In the case ofr Timequake, you've picked up one of his misses, I am a true fan of this zany author, but this time his self ""heoroizing"" and annoying jargon got to my last nerve. I finished the book for the purpose of not wanting to finish it later, but it wasn't the best time i ever spent. All reading is good reading and this had it laughs and abstrack story lines, but all in all it was the worste book of Vonnegut's I've read. For the record i have read nearly ten, so i have so opinion on this."
3,"Dear Mr. Vonnegut, write another book","This books is mediocre. Only read it if you've read everything else of Vonneguts and must have more. And to Mr. Vonnegut, so you're 74, big deal. I hear of no reported debilitating illnesses, so sit down and right another, better book. My dad's 93 and still working. You could be hanging around for another 20 years or more, so don't give us this retirement routine. Retirement is only for people with office jobs."
1,A stream-of-consciousness non-novel with no plot.,"It reads like abstract art without a guide. A collection of mostly unrelated paragraphs with no sense of cohesion. I feel like the ""timequake,"" which did not enter significantly into the book (I can't truly call it a story), was an ad hoc gimic for the purpose of allowing the author to publish his late-night musings under the guise of ""fiction."" Granted, it was amusing and occassionally moving, even thought-provoking, but it was like looking at a photo album which had been accidentally dropped and the pictures badly shuffled."
2,Where's the quake?,I kept waiting for the story to kick in and it never did. Along the way some very interesting comments on us earthlings and of course Vonnegut's view of death. That made it worth it for me - just about.
2,FAR FROM BRILLIANT,"WHAT CAN I SAY? IT'S JUST NOT FRESH ANY MORE. TIMEQUAKE ANNOYED ME, THOUGH NOT FOR THE SAME REASONS AS SOME OF THE OTHER REVIEWERS.NO, THE PROBLEM I SAW WAS THAT VONNEGUT SEEMED CONTENT TO REPEAT, LINE FOR LINE, THE IDEAS PRESENTED IN HIS 1992 BIO ""FATES WORSE THAN DEATH."" IT'S ONE THING TO ADD PERSONAL MEMOIRS TO ONE'S WORK(LIKE MANY OTHER REVIEWERS, I THOUGHT ""BREAKFAST OF CHAMPIONS WAS BRILLIANT), BUT QUITE ANOTHER TO PLAGIARIZE ONESSELF TO FILL DEAD SPACE WHEN HAVING DIFFICULTY THINKING UP NEW FICTIONAL IDEAS.I WANTED THIS BOOK TO BE BRILLIANT, AND PERHAPS MY HIGH HOPES DIDN'T ALLOW ME THE ENJOYMENT I WOULD HAVE HAD OTHERWISE. REGARDLESS, I STILL HAVE TO RANK THIS ONE AMONG VONNEGUT'S WORST EFFORTS, RIGHT DOWN THERE WITH ""DEADEYE DICK"" AND ""JAILBIRD"" IN HIS LATE 70'S/EARLY 80'S DOWNTURN. DO NOT BUY TIMEQUAKE UNLESS YOU'RE A HARDCORE FAN."
4,Very good...But not his best.,"This book is funny, entertaining, depressing, and autobiographical all at the same time. It is different than many of his other novels, because he is the main character in this one. He tells true stories about himself and incorporates them into his plot. While slow moving at times, it is always still readable. I liked this book, but it can't compare to such greats as ""Slaughterhouse Five"" and ""Cat's Cradle""."
2,Vonnegut is great... this book...not so much,"Not a typical Vonnegut book. Not really a story. Kind of like listening to a rambling old man talking about his medications.Vonnegut is one of my favorite authors, but this isn't a good book."
2,"If this isn't bad, what is?","I have only read Slaughterhouse-5 before I read this (i.e. not a die-hard fan), so I may not be in the target group for Timequake. Anyway, I felt the book didn't have a real story, it was just independent thoughts wrapped together in a nice package.It would have been more interesting to read Timequake one"
5,Vonnegut is a master story teller,"This book was hilarious and full of interesting insites by the author and his fiction self Kilgore Trout. Worth a read, I luved it."
4,A mixed bag,"Early on, I was a bit annoyed and put off by ""Timequake."" But once I stopped worrying about the story and plot, and just read, it was good. I essentially ignored the plot, because he's done similar things dozens of times in the past, and better, too. But when he spun away from the story which he did frequently, you feel like he's just BS-ing with you about his life. That was much more interesting than the story and, being a Vonnegut fan, it worked. I'm not sure if first-time Vonnegut readers would get much out of this, since you have to sort of know his background to get a handle on it. So that part is a 5-star; the actual story is about a 1 or maybe 2. Oh well. He deserves to get a little lazy."
4,hardly a wasted word,"On the plane to Montana and back, I read Vonnegut's new (and last?) book, Timequake. I gotta say, he's a sweet sad sharp-eyed man, and so is his book. It's a quick read, and for me it was a great pleasure. It rambles and just barely manages to have a plot, but there's hardly a wasted word."
2,They look great but function poorly,These towel holders look fanstastic but are very poorly designed. There is a metal sleeve on each end of the bar which holds it in place but there is so much slop taht it often slips and the bar falls off and even when it still up you can see the gaps on each end.As very big dissapointment. Another example of form over function.
2,Nice looking but poor design,"I bought this towel bar to match my faucets, shower head, etc. and now sadly, I'm stuck with it. It's a terrible design. First, it is not one uniform piece, but three pieces, and the towels are constantly getting snagged and destroyed where the pieces fit together. Second, it never fit properly and was always loose on the wall and sagging, until my cleaning lady finally did something (not sure what -- probably yanked a towel off it) and it simply just broke and is unfixable. This is just two months after installation. I love all the other pieces in the line, which seem to be well designed and well constructed but this towel bar is so bad, I even thought I might have unknowingly purchased a knockoff. Having read the other reviews, I don't think that's the case. And it's not cheap, either! So frustrating."
3,Looks good but not solid,"This towel rack looks good and installs easily but the central rod is a hollow tube and not very sturdy. I cannot use this rack as a hand hold since it would come apart. Admittedly, no one said you could use the rack as a handhold. However, the bathroom is a dangerous place and if you slip it would be nice if you could use the towel rack to steady yourself. On the positive side having a three piece unit certainly makes installation easier."
4,you have to read these lyrics,I had read one of Gwens songs in a book & I had to get the CD. Some of the songs are very painful & heartfelt.
3,Miracles & mischief: Noh and Kyogen theater in Japan,"The book is actually a catalogue for an exhibition, held in Los Angeles, of Noh masks, robes, and other properties. The pictures are excellent, although the backs of masks are not shown, detracting from the book's usefulness as research material. More serious is the badly translated, poorly written section on masks, which seriously degrades the overall quality of the work."
5,Wonderful textbook!,"This text book is incredibly thorough, yet concise. Understandable explanations and real-world examples make understanding and applying the concepts easy. The author's sense of humor makes the text that much more enjoyable. The sequencing of chapters and references within the chapters to past or future explanations is helpful. There are practice quizzes at the end of each chapter that are thought provoking and a good test of your understanding of the material. I highly recommend this book."
3,It's okay,"The back of the book was very sticky and it was a little worn, but overall it is not too bad."
3,OK B movie,"Loving Bogart,anything he is in I like,this was a classic Warners B-Movie,Mary Astor looked a little heavy,never saw that before."
4,Bogey is King!!!!!!!,"Let's face it, Bogart was a true hollywood professional and the fact that not to many of his movies stunk make him a true legend of the silver screen. As far as this movie goes, Bogart is on the prowl again with his flamboyent self confidence and charming dialogue. Bogart is truly the king of B&W movies."
4,OLD SCHOOL PULP FICTION,"Across the Pacific is one of those great old war-time thillers from the 1940s.Starring Humphrey Bogart,Mary Astor and Sydney Greenstreet this is great fun.Bogie tracks down ""jap"" spies in Panama(if not quite across the Pacific) while romancing Astor and matching wits with villian Greenstreet.Victor Sen Yung is a standout as an Americanized ""jap gunsel"" who at one point uses judo to put Bogie into low orbit.A great piece of war-time propaganda.Well written,well directed and well acted."
5,good job,Thank's! I love Bogart. Now i have a great copy of Across the Pacific. You did a great job in the care of this tape . I can injoy it for year to come. THANK'S from Art
5,this was one of bogie's less know,this is a good movie and the price was great and the packaging was very good and i hope to deal with this sell again
4,The Maltese Falcon Part II ?,"Humphrey Bogart, Mary Astor, Sydney Greenstreet, and John Huston reteamed after The Maltese Falcon to make this film, and although this movie is not in the same league as their first effort (but how many movies are?), it is entertaining nonetheless. Set primarily aboard a Japanese freighter, it's basically an espionage thriller with a lot of humour thrown in, as Bogart attempts to get information on Greenstreet's shady dealings with the Japanese, while also romancing Astor, who may or may not be involved in the goings on as well. The dialogue is snappy and the performances are all light and easy and well done, with Bogart and Astor displaying more of the chemistry seen in The Maltese Falcon. It's too bad they didn't do other films together. Although this movie isn't as great as the other Bogart/Huston films, it's more than worth a look."
4,ACROSS THE PACIFIC,"I was eager to see this film because it reteamed THE MALTESE FALCON leads (Humphrey Bogart and Mary Astor), and the Director (John Huston).It did not dissapiont. Not Bogart's best film, but I enjoyed this film a lot anyway. I thought that it was well-acted, with a good plot. The plot is fairly simple: Humphrey Bogart follows some spies to Panama, meeting up with a girl (Mary Astor) along the way. The film is similar to some other films made during the 1940s, but it still has a unique feeling to it. In regards to the film's name, I'm not sure why it's titled ""Across The Pacific"", but I think it might be refering to what was going on across the Pacific at the time the movie took place. It ended on December 7th, 1941 (HINT HINT).I would reccomend this film to anybody who is a Humphrey Bogart fan, or a fan of THE MALTESE FALCON."
4,Enjoyable WWII espionage,"The film was witty and reunited the stars of the previous year's ""Maltese Falcon"". The propaganda gets a bit heavy handed at times in the final 3rd.However, really enjoyable is the Warners blooper reel from '42. It is fun to see some of the studio's big names cursing when they flub lines (John Garfield, Barbara Stanwyck, Olivia DeHavilland, even Reagan.)"
2,A disposable phone for a throwaway world,"This product functioned suitably while it lasted. Unfortunately, it was only about 18 months. I replaced the Nicad battery twice at a cost of almost $20 per pop. And yes, I DID run the battery down as recommended and did not have it constantly on the cradle. The sound quality was relatively good and the ability to page the handset from the base was nice. The speakerphone was also relatively good. A huge complaint-No battery backup. Everytime the power went out, everything-remote access codes, basic settings and OGM had to be reset. I generally love Sony products. Not this one, however. I am still looking for a replacement. The handset is completely dead-not the battery this time. Save your money."
1,"Bad service, ended up cancelling the order","I ordered a framed poster from these guys and they said it would be 10 days before they could deliver. At day 10, there still was no shippingnumber and they had not changed the delivery data. So I email them. No answer, just a delay of another week in the delivery date. Week goes by, no trackingnumber, no new deliverydate. I email them again and this time I got an answer that their supplier had a broken machine and now they are 2 days behind schedule. I wonder 2 days? They have already had 7 extra days. I ask them when the item will come, no answer in my amazon account the delivery date changed again with another week. After a week, no trackingnumber, no new delivery. I email again and ask them for a definate delivery date. They did not give me a date and changed the amazon deliverydate to add another 2 weeks. By that time I have had it and cancelled the order."
2,Nightlight Review,"Very nice painted nightlight, however the art glass moves all over the place. Can't be adjusted and when it is for a kids bedroom this is not good. On the box it said with sensor however it only has a switch for on and off."
3,Good nightlight,"This is overall a pretty decent nightlight; however, the glass part tends to turn when you just barely touch it. If it is placed somewhere that you won't need to move it, then the problem doesn't really affect you at all. This was purchased for a kids sports-themed room and makes a GREAT addition to the decor. It doesn't look like your typical cheap plastic nightlight, because it isn't. Very affordable and stylish."
4,From the cover:,"From the back of the book:This is a provocative book in which a group of prominent theologians and scholars or religion not only criticize strongly some of the core assumptions, understandings, and themes of early liberation theology, but also raise insightful possibilities to overcome the limitations, reconstruct the analytical frameworks, and refashion the power to engage in today's struggles for change of this living and evolving theological tradition."
5,"Last deodorant you will ever buy, unless you drop it","I have been using deodorant stones for 30 years instead of sprays, sticks or roll-ons. They really work. They also never really wear out and the only way you need a new one is if you drop it and it breaks - over and over. My last one was around for 8 - 10 years and it was not nearly as big as this. Did I say it really works? It closes your pores to keep you from sweating. This stone will also stop bleeding from razor cuts or anything else. Just wet it before applying."
4,awesome,"I use it more than regular anti-persperant, but its WAY better than any deodorant I've ever used. Its replaced my Mitchum anti-perperant. Not sure how it works, Im guessing it kills the bacteria that creates odors , but its works on other part of the body as well, feet etc.recommended. Plus a one year warranty? really that's ridiculous."
3,"Decent product, but fragile","I like the product because it's natural and my household is trying like mad to get away from chemicals. However, I found like I have to use it beyond liberally for it to work for any period of time. I have let my body adjust to natural products, but I'm still having to take the time for a liberal application. The other thing I don't like about it, and this is probably because I'm clumsy, but it gets very slippery and I tend to drop it. Once I drop it and it cracks or splits apart, there are so many rough edges I end up cutting myself. On the other hand, it does work and the product itself lasts for quite a long time."
2,Didn't seem to work well,I used it for quite a few months and it did not hold up if I began to sweat even a little. I had high hopes after reading some of the reviews but it did not work.
2,Ended up throwing,"I bought this product hoping for an alternative to the aluminum based ones normally used. It worked fine for wintertime when I only had desk work to do. However, with any amount of activity I found myself needing a deodorant. I ended up throwing the stone away in search of something different."
2,Doesn't work for me,This product just doesn't work for me. It's been a couple days and I try to apply as much of it but I start to sweat and smell within a couple hours.
4,It's good for the price,"My purpose of buying the crystal deodarant was to try to rid of the discoloration I got from Secret Deodorant.I don't like the idea of holding a dodorizer in your hands when applying, but it's ok with this crystal, my hands just feel slightly dryer. Which in a way is good if you have sweaty palms O_oSo far its just an ok product, I've tried the Crystal brand (ASIN: B000L978FU UPC: 086449300031)before, it worked better than this Thai Deodorant toward the first few months, but than it seems like that was it...I commute to work, taking the subway and the bus, and from what I've noticed, 1 of 5 times I can smell my B/O after I get home... that's not something I want especially if the busses get crowded.Ultimately I still prefer the Thai stone over the stuff you find in the markets...3.5 - 4 stars for me."
5,Yes it works!,"After getting a bad rash from more conventional, commercial products I tried this stone about 5 years ago. I am on my third which means that each one lasts me about 1 1/2 years. They work, I don't smell and my clothes don't have the stains on them that a lot of commercial products make."
4,Scanner problems,"While the scanner is a good one and I'm happy I bought it, it was VERY difficult to get it installed. The accompanying software for the twain driver was insufficient and it needed to be downloaded from the Epson website and unzipped. It took tech support hours to figure this out. I later found out that this is a normal problem with Epson scanners. My advice is to be sure to buy the extended warrenty/tech support if one is offered. Epson's tech support number is NOT toll free and was stated by another reviewer not to be very helpful."
1,HORRIBLE!,"I did not buy these headphones, they just came with a CD Player that I bought. The CD Player was great, but I was disappointed with the headphones. I needed new headphones, but I had to buy new ones because these were so horrible. They don't go in your ears, the headphone parts are just circles. Something that is a large plastic circle will not fit in an ear. The sound is decent, but you can't hear the sound if you can't put the headphones in your ears. They were a big dissappointment for me, and I advise you to stay away from them. If you need good headphones, get Sony ones, they are comfortable, have good sound."
1,These are painful to put in ears and the sound is horrible!,I bought a cassette recorder that had these earphones. I love the cassetter recorder but these earphones are easily the worst I have ever tried!
4,beautifully written. about sad people though.,"There's no doubt that Tom Perrotta is a terrific writer. His prose flows and one forgets that one's reading. He has a real ear for dialogue and emotional concerns of his characters, and he gets the life of a working musician absolutely right. Too bad his characters are all kind of stupid people. It was hard to empathize with them. In some ways, this is a book version of the film DINER."
2,kinda boring and predictable,"For Context:I read all the time and am a big fan of Nabokov, Robbins, Tolstoy, Dostoevsky, Hesse among others.I was ""recommended"" this book by Amazon b/c I am a fan of Tom Robbins and Christopher Moore.My Feedback:This book was pretty slow and not that inventive....kind of a plain story about a wedding band and a guy who didn't want to get married.Saying that, I did finish it instead of giving up (as i will do if a book is exceptionally crappy)....wouldn't recommend it either way."
3,Would have made a fascinating longer read..,"'The Wishbones' is a sharp, witty and fast read, which doesn't cover any revolutionary territory or come to any deep worldy conclusions. However, it is entertaining enough and undoubtedly better than Perrotta's latter works, namely 'Little Children'. However, I did not think it was quite as good as most reviewers have suggested, simply because it doesn't draw itself out long enough to develop anywhere important.Perrotta appears to have a deep seated fascination with sex and adultery, and for this reason, his collection of works are not entirely dissimilar and can lack the drive and purpose they should. His characterisations are wonderfully developed and wildly humourous, yet because the plot doesn't develop, you come to question the purpose of these fantastic side-characters.Basicially, I felt that 'The Wishbones' was well-written and beautifully voiced, but that it failed to clearly articulate a purpose or sense of artistic depth."
4,Wedding Singer meets High Fidelity,"I was much more entertained by this story of a 30-year-old New Jersey wedding musician than I had anticipated being. It's sort of a The Wedding Singer meets Nick Hornby page-turner as we follow the professional and romantic progress of guitarist Dave over the course of a summer, as he attempts to resolve his love of being a musician with the reality of being an adult and living at home. The male characters are all interesting and well-drawn, and while the commitment issues are somewhat hackneyed, it's excellent in portraying the ambivalence some of us have to ""settling down."""
2,"I wanted to like this, honest.....","...but apart from the fact that Perotta has a deft way with words and has his rock 'n roll trivia down cold (quick, who is Mick Box?), I saw the turns the plot was going to take as soon as the main character says to his girlfriend of 15 years, ""Let's get married."" I don't know, maybe it's one of those books that really wants to be a movie..."
4,solid,"Perrotta is always fun to read. He has such an easy style and understands men and women. He often reminds me of Nick Hornby and this is similar yo HIGH FIDELITY in several ways. It isn't his best book, but it is enjoyable and smart without being pretentious or smarmy."
3,Not great for volume control...,"I got these earphones primarily for the volume control feature to use on my PC, so that I won't have to click around with the mouse everytime I want to change the volume. These turned out not to be so great for this because...a) The range of volume control is too minor to be useful. The sound difference between the min and max setting on the volume control is perhaps only 1/10 of total volume difference you can get by manually setting it on the PC.b) The volume control is set quite close to the earphones, so, unless you let the lines dangle in front of you, there's a lot fumbling around the neck trying to find the volume control.C)the sound quality is also quite mediocre.Overall, I'd recommend spending a little more getting a better pair which might be more functional."
3,Panasonic headset w/ volume control,"This is my second set. The reason I'm giving it 3* is because it did not take long before the volume control started to have problems. However, sound wise, it's a great headset for any MP3 player. It's worth $7.49 (but not too much more than that)."
1,panasonic cheaper than sony but quality is poor compared to sony,"my this earbud headphone is poor in bass response comapared to my sony mdr g-54lp(beware mdr-g54lp and mdr g54lp is two different models there is difference of - sign) actually in experts view this type small earbuds use to give poor sound this is true with any brand and model so never buy earbud type small headphone if you want small headphone buy IN THE EAR CANAL type headphone in experts view this type in ear earphone use to give good crystal clear sound example sony mdr ex 71 / 81, shure e2c etc. if bigger headphone is ok than buy mdr-g54lp"
3,Meh. Not That Impressed.,"The sound is a lot like an old transistor radio speaker: muffled, tinny, weak. There are headphones and earbuds out there that will do a much better job for you."
5,Exceptional Mysterious Historical Romance,"You can read about the storyline from the other reviewers and if you are looking for just another bunch of love scenes in your romance this is not the book for you. It has some great steaminess about it, but this novel is much more. Quick's characters (both main and secondary) are extremely lovable in all 3 books (this is the first in this series) and you will enjoy their mannerisms and sense of humor. The mystery and historical details are also great fun. You won't be disappointed if you are looking for good writing and a little more depth to your romantic intrigues."
3,average,"This is my first Amanda Quick book, I've heard so much about her, and read her reviews on my favorite books that I tried one of her books. For me, Slightly Shady is the kind of book that u can read when there's nothing more available. It's not boring nor it is hooking. This is one of those books that u can put down after reading a paragraph or so. It is not laugh out loud funny but u can see the author's attempt on comedy. The mystery is a little predictable. The twist on the ending is not original. All in all, I'm not totally disappointed. From reading her other reviews in her other novels, I know this is not her best, so I'm giving her another chance."
3,A interesting book,"This book was good although I got sort of tired of the book after a while you have to finish it. It is a classic Amanda Quick book. And I am planning to read the other books that go along with it. It very much indeed is light reading. Yet each character has there own spark, the main girl just kinda got annyoing though."
2,"I didn't think Ms Krentz can do such a bad book, nor Quick","I bought this book because appeared as the last one written by Krentz, whose books I did enjoy along the years.This not only is not a whole book, lets you hang waiting for the next (I will not read it) for the what will become of their relationship, (other then have sex and not love together from time to time or work on some not interesting cases), but somehow feels as it is a very bad revrite of some Agatha Cristy novels, about a couple of spies, in England. But those, dated books, were interesting, captivating at least. I am extremly deceived.How can she write such a thing (and even with Quick name) ?"
2,Disappointed,I have read all of Amanda Quick's books and found this one lacking. The relationship between the main characters was frustrating. There was no passion between them. There was more passion between the secondary charactors which was predictable. I did finish the book and found the ending left me hanging.
1,"More than ""Slightly"" Dissappointed","I agree with the above two readers!!! Very Dissappointed!!! Ms. Quick, if you happen to read this.... please take this to heart from a long time avid reader of your work... If you are planning a sequel to this book? (And the last book that you wrote under Jayne Castle) PLEASE at least give us (the readers) the satisfaction of finishing the first book. If you are changing your writing style to fit the more ""mainstream"" writers/readers... please remember to be true to your fans. We have stayed true to you."
2,Pot Boiler,"I, too, was extremely disappointed with this book. I have read EVERYTHING that JAK has ever written, including her early mysteries. This is probably the worst of her books that I have ever read. I get the feeling that her contract called for another title and so this one was rushed out very quickly and without much thought. I would not recommend this example of her work to a new reader."
3,Slightly Off Course,"Amanda Quick is an outstanding author, who keeps me riveted and turning the pages as fast as I can read. So, it was slightly disappointing to discover a book by her that was interesting, but that lacked the elements that make her usually a truly great writer--humor, wit, well-drawn characters and fast paced storylines. The characters here are okay, but the chemistry between them neither ignites nor develops believably. Unlike so many of her books which tell tales of the Ton, the main characters are more members of the Intellgentsia, and lack the social connections, entree and financial resources to be part of the Ton. Instead of owning fashionable things, they struggle to earn what they can off the wealthy Ton. The secondary set of characters in this novel, the niece and the brother-in-law of the main characters are well-drawn and likable. This is a book worth reading, but only after having finished all her others, which are so much better."
2,Disappointing,I expected better from Judith. Did she really write it or was it someone using her name. It lacked development & passion. Let's hope the next one is back to her usual great performance.
4,Okay,"Thought this book was just okay, kinda Lon,, was ready for it to end. Only to find out they still didn't get a happy ending...because there's another book. Too much for me"
3,"Not a romance, it's a mystery","Krentz has been delving more into the mystery writing and her romantic side is definitely not in play here. Any scenes that involve romance, OK, sex, are fairly clinical and rather remote, we don't really get a chance to know and love the characters. If you look at the plot as a mystery though I think Krentz has done a wonderful job, not only leaving you guessing right up to the last point (I usually figure these things out pretty quickly) she leaves plenty of room to doubt whether we have the whole story, even at the end. I feel we are being set up for a series on these two, it would explain the lack of character development. If not, enjoy the mystery side of it anyway. So, for someone that got initiated into Romance by Krentz I feel regret she has recently taken a different path but as a mystery lover I am beginning to enjoy her slow but sure development in that area."
2,disappointing,"I have read nearly all of Amanda Quick's novels and to be sure, ""Slightly Shady"" is a disappointment. Usually her characters, both hero & heroine, are endearing and memorable, but these lacked spunk! Tobias, the ""hero"" was rather dull and Lavinia, the heroine, was a complainer. Both were characters I wouldn't care to know.Also, Quick tried to write a deep mystery but forgot the romance! Where do the characters stand at the end of the book!I miss the characters of ""Mistress"" and ""Reckless"", my two favorite of Quick's novels. Where is your old style?"
2,Where is the romance?,"Lavinia Lake had every reason to dislike and distrust Tobias March. Claiming it was for her own good, Tobias destroyed the antique shop she owned in Italy with her niece. Forced to return to London, Lavinia turned to private inquiries. She literally runs into Tobias while investigating the man blackmailing her. They form an uneasy alliance when they determine they are working toward a mutual goal. An interesting mystery is the heart of plot of this story. The investigation is full of twists and turns and unusual details. The outcome is unsure until the very end, with the suspense building until the resolution. Unfortunately, the budding romance at the heart of any romance, is sorely missing from this story. Lavinia and Tobias grow to care about each other as the adventure progresses, but it is unclear if they love each other."
2,Slightly Boring,Sorry Amanda Quick but this one was disappointing. The storyline was OK but I really never liked Lavinia. I liked the niece Emeline better. It never really made any sense when Tobias got shot in the leg. He just wasn't able to move as quickly. I guess that was to make him a flawed hero. AQ earlier books are so much better. I am going to wait before purchasing another hardback by AQ because I have been disappointed by this one and the Wicked Widow.
1,If You Really Want It,If you really must have this book I would get it from a used book store. I have read all of her books and this one I bought a week ago and still haven't finished it. It is not one of her best it is even worse then The Wicked Widow. I don't think I'll be buying any more of her books.
1,More than slightly the lights are out,I'll make this short. I agree with previous reviewers who found this book slow and dull. There is no spark between the protagonists. The repeated formula of distrust and the juvenile behavior is tedious. I had hoped Ms Krentz was going to get back on target but to find out this is first in a series is disheartening. The slightly good from all this is I have time to read and discover new authors.
1,Sorry to say . . . .,"Jayne Krentz(amanda quick) is one of the authors I collect and buy brand new in hard back. I have always loved her stories, however I must agree with the poor reviews, I didn't like the characters, didn't care what happended to them, didn't finish the books. That is a first for me with this author"
1,Thoroughly disappointed...,"I've read all of the Amanda Quick novels plus most titles by Jayne Ann Krentz. Is it me or have the past few ""Amanda Quick"" novels lacked the romance, passion, and mystery we've come to love? This book was unengrossing, unimaginative, and, to continue on the frank road, BORING! I skimmed most of the book, not even enjoying the few moments Tobias and Lavinia spent together. I may have to wait for future Amanda Quick novels to go to paperback. I'd like my money back on this one."
2,"""MUST YOU ARGUE EVERY DAMN POINT, LAVINIA?""","That line, straight from the book, sums up what was most frustrating about this story. The author made the heroine (Lavinia) so darn annoying! She became almost unreadable. (But don't ask me what she looked like because by the last page, all the reader knew was that she was a short redhead with small boobs--which was more than was described about most of the characters.) Add the fact that parts of this tale drug like cold molasses and others were so thoroughly eye-rolling silly and well, you get the picture. It was a shame as this could have been a fun story."
3,Slightly Shady,"It started so well. It was funny. The characters were likeable. Tobias and Lavinia are displaying some attraction for one another. Then . . . there's the painfully predictable ""carriage"" scene. The murder plot became so convoluted in its solution, I feared I'd be confessing next. By the time the second short, choppy, terribly unromantic love scene rolled around, I'd literally forgotten I was reading a romance. Tobias, likeable fellow, came off as a rather inept detective. I'm glad I checked this out of the library instead of buying it."
4,Interesting Character Dynamics,"This was my first Amanda Quick book, so I did not have any expectations that the folks had who were already her fans. I really enjoyed the book. I liked the different relationship between Tobias and Lavinia. The fact they meet while he is destroying her shop sets the stage for the bickering and arguments that follow. Also, they have both been married and lost someone they loved. This influences the development of a relationship between them. I think this is as much character driven as it is plot driven.I liked this so much I bought the two follow up books right away. I wish she would continue these characters, but it does not look like she is.If you are in doubt, read the book!"
2,Not bad,"I've listened to a lot of audio tapes this past year. This was an interesting read. It wasn't great, it wasn't bad. There was an acceptible plot, an unlikely heroine, silly love side stories, and a good ending. It was very well read.Hard core readers (and listeners) will be disappointed by the formulaic nature, but if you need to have a book on tape, this one will leave you with a few well-remembered moments. Other books are more fulfilling, though."
1,She could do so much better!,"Maybe it's to be expected -- after so many great (or at least solidly good) books from Amanda Quick/Jayne Ann Kretz/Jayne Castle -- she got a little bored. Or tired. Or something...In short, skip this book in hardcover. If you're brave (or devoted) pick it up as a paperback..."
2,definatly shady,"I am an Amanda Quick fan, but the last few books have not been up to par with her earlier work. Slightly Shady was a gray pale compaired to the sparkling stories and characters of a few years ago. There was no character description, who were we reading about? I felt no connection to the people and was unimpressed with the story line. I normally buy an Amanda Quick book right away, sight unseen, I may just wait to get the next one."
4,I seem to be in the minority.,I finished Slightly Shady today and I enjoyed it very much. It was not my favorite Amanda Quick book but it wasn't as bad as all that!! The chemistry between the characters is great. I laughed out loud many times while reading it. I got my money's worth. I will continue to read anything and everything by Ms. Krentz.
1,her worst ever,I am one of her greatest fans and i have read everything she has ever written but this is the worst Amanda Quick book i have ever read. The characters lacked passion unlike the first set of Amanda Quick novels. She needs to go back to her intial style because that's how fans like me got hooked.
1,lots of technical problems,"this is a very easy camera to use but we have had lots of problems with it. i think it is a very cheaply made camcorder and i would advise buying another. about 1 year after we bought it just stopped working. we took it to be repaired and it cost [$$$$] to fix it and it took 4 weeks. it was the one time i wished i had bought the 'extended warranty' from the store.soon after that the light stopped working--it actually still records ok in low light but it's kind of annoying to not have it for some things. then, 3 days before this christmas it started acting up again and all of a tape we shot came out with half the screen distorted and unviewable. when i took the tape out to investigate there was a wire sticking up which obviously was not supposed to be there. rather than pay and wait for repair we just tossed it. i'm very suspicious of JVC now."
5,Unforgettable After All These Years,Simply the best and most memorable TV series of all time for me. Still resonates in the back of my head.
5,Please bring back Molly!,"I have waited 2 decades for a video release of this fine TV series. Literate, eccentric, and magical, it has yet to be matched. I have every single episode taped in Beta format but do not have a Beta player. Please create a DVD!"
5,PLEASE RELEASE DAYS AND NIGHTS OF MOLLY DODD ON DVD,The sooner you release Molly Dodd on DVD the happier my days and nights will be.
5,Among 5 Best TV Shows of All Time,"This brilliant program, for which the delightful Blair Brown was nominated for the Emmy five years in a row (but kept losing to Candice Bergen for her good but forgettably one-note Murphy Brown and Helen Hunt for the awful whatchamacallit show with Paul Reiser) was a generation ahead of its time. No program before or since has captured the bittersweet elements of life so realistically and entertainingly. The writing was superb, the casting perfect, and the acting absolutely top-notch. I have a million memories of this series and quote it all the time (""Who writes this crap?""; ""More pork things!""). It is shocking and unbelievable that the series has not been made available on DVD. I will pay nearly any price for it!!!"
5,Bring back Molly!,"I was a graduate student when ""Molly Dodd"" was on TV, and I never missed an episode, even when I should have been studying. I taped some of the episodes later on when they were re-run on Lifetime, but my tapes are sadly deteriorated and moldy after 20 years in the heat and humidity of Puerto Rico. It's time to get Molly on DVD! Her fans are anxiously waiting! This is TV at its very best."
4,We want the DVD now.,"With that beautifully styled red hair and killer smile, she was the best looking woman on TV ever. Her acting ain't bad either. Lets get moving on the release of that DVD or we will come down there and picket the place."
3,Love/Hate Series,I haven't read all the reviews but I thought I give my two cents worth. I remember watching the series when it aired in the late 1980's and had something of a love/hate attitude toward it. I love Blair Brown although the only program I saw her in extensively was James Michener's Space; a mini-series that met with mostly negative reviews but I thought Brown's did a good job in her role as Penny Pope. I also loved her role in Altered States and more recently in her somewhat cameo role in Space Cowboys which starred her Space co-star James Garner.The problem I had with the series was that I thought the humor was a little over the top. It's been some 16 years since I watched an episode and that was only because I caught a few shows on A&E; I think when I subscribed to cable. I never seen all the episodes simply because although I loved the star I hated the plot.
4,"Good, not excellent","I'm giving this movie a 4* rating because it is entertaining and more than just a bit moving at times. The protagonist is perhaps not the most lovable of all of the Spanish Bears one might find in movies, but he's convincing as a person who can both grow and change. If you like BearCub you will probably like this movie; however, you might find it to be a second-rate knock-off of that superior filem."
5,Excellent page-turner with bicultural insights,"This is a breezy popular novel and great read with many insights into navigating the conflicts of Indian-American identity. An Indian-American returns to India and learns more about her country and herself. The story moves fast and entertainingly, and its affecting sensational content dramatises our understanding of the character's conflicts with superb insight. Such cross-cultural differences as sexual identity and male-female relationships are delineated with acuity and power. A scene of widow-burning, for example, brings home the senseless cruelty of this Indian practise with searing effect. The novel's depiction of upper-class dilemmas -- the worlds it reveals are those of the affluent well-born -- are particularly well-drawn, with appealing and entertaining wit. A must-read."
3,A Novel That Explores Upper-Class Indian Decadence,"Ameena Meer's first novel, ""Bombay Talkie"", is about the world of the upper-class Indian ""Brat pack"". Sabah is a young American-born rich kid, who as many young leads in immigration based novels, is searching for identity. Her search, however, is through partying , men and her travels to India and back. The plot is a bit difficult to follow but it seems to center on Sabah's relationship with her best friend Rani, who goes to India to marry, and her cousin Adam, who she meets up with in New York after he follows his male lover there from London. In her attempt to flood the reader with shocking subject matter, Meer loses focus. Amir brings up some interesting aspects of the new generation and she has an eye for detail, but the characters could use more complexity."
2,How does stuff like this get published?,"However many hours I spent reading this novel were wasted ones. I moved on to Nirmal Verma's Under Cover of Darkness immediately after Bombay Talkie and I was relieved that, yes, some writers do have talent. A self professed lover of literature should not be submitting garbage like Bombay Talkie for publication."
2,"Cheap materials, poor weilding.","It does the job, but its incredibly unsturdy. The welding broke off of both of my stands when i was attaching the screw in the outerpost to keep my my stand extensions up, so i know it's not just a one time incident. I wish I didn't order these, albeit the cheap price."
4,Time for some kick butt action,Loved the games----three for the price of one----right on! Enjoyed the campaigns and the squirmeshes. Very exciting games. All gammers that like action packed games should try this one.
4,Fix for Defective game being shipped by Amazon,"Amazon is *still* shipping defective copies of this game (I got it for Xmas and was attempting to install it today).However, a quick google found a solution to the problem if you buy this game from Amazon and receive the misprinted installation key which will prevent you from even installing it:Enter the first two sets of numbers from the key on the manual, then '0000' in the third input field, then the next two sets of numbers from your key.Worked like a charm."
5,You want to buy this.,"One of the best RTS' I've played in years, a great game for any Warhammer 40K fans, and if you aren't, this game will make you into one.Dawn of War and Winter Assault have very nice story line and game play aspects, while Dark Crusade brings about some very nice overhauls to the tech trees to bring the game's whooping 7 races into multiplayer balance.Enjoy."
1,Winter Assult CD-KEY delivered with the game did not work,Can't play this because many of the games shipped thru amazon came with BAD CD KEYS. Poor quality control from THQ and AMazon should have gotten in front of this. I'm sure it's a great game.... BEWARE!!! Get this one at brick and mortar.
1,Defective Product,"I disagree with J. S. Thomas Jethro below. Amazon, once notified about the problem should have removed this listing until THQ rectifies the bad key code issue. Evidently they still have bad stock, as I received one last week. I wrote directly to THQ and they have not responded to me at all. I've requested a refund and will not repurchase this from Amazon unless directly notified by them that the issue is corrected."
4,"Like Starcraft, Great Value","First, I received this game in December, 2009 from Amazon and it did not have a defective installation key. Hopefully that issue has been resolved, although other reviewers have posted the easy fix.I am new to Warhammer 40K and found it to be very like the classic game Starcraft. If you are waiting for Starcraft II and are looking for something similar, this game is for you. The skirmish mode is very fun and repayable, single or multiplayer. It does seem to lack map building software though."
4,A Suspenseful Page-Turner,"Interracial romances/marriages are a fact of life in our world. Sadly, the romance genre has been rather slow at playing catch-up with modern times.I enjoyed 'From the Ashes'. First, the lead character, Paige, is a refreshing treat from the typical size six romance heroine. She's a character that many women could relate to, considering the average woman in America wears a size 12 to 14. I especially liked the way the authors described Paige's body type, both playful and affirming. I loved the fact that Paige was a model. I'd like to see more romance authors be as bold.The fact that there was a conflict of cultures--namely that of Linc's and of Paige's, was eye-opening to say the least. And the conflict wasn't sugar-coated.I am extremely thankful that at least ONE romance publishing company has the guts and the savvy foresight to take romance to the next level. I'm also looking forward to more books by these two writers."
3,Romance Novel? Are You Sure.......,"Well, I have to say that this wasn't one of the worst romance novels I've ever read, But it sure wasn't the most interesting. What usually would take me 2 days to read took more like 2 months. I couldn't get into the story. I mean I didn't know whether Paige was suppose to be a strong black woman or a damsiel in distress. I became so fustrated at the whole ""I need a man to save me"" routine. But I can honestly say I did enjoy the chemistry between the couples. I really liked Lincoln and Paige as a couple and I also enjoyed reading about Jack and Mara. I also liked the fact that these women weren't ""little women"". Oh well like another reviewer said maybe the authors will write about this couple again with a more captivating story. Because the ending read more like a Scooby Doo mystery cartoon than a passionate romance novel. If it wasn't for the epilogue I don't know what I would have thought."
3,Has potential but....,"This book has a lot of potential to go some where but unfortunately the author doesn't take you anywhere. I like the fact that she made the main character a full figured woman instead of our usual size 6, always going to the gym, characters. And that the leading man was Native American, very nice touch...2 cool points for the author's creativity and willingness to ""color"" (no pun intended) outside the lines. Unfortunately some of the things in this book were just a little too far-fetched for me. Hey, but you may like it =)"
2,What did you see in this book?,"I read the reviews for the book'From the Ashes' and it caused me to buy it. I was very disappointed with the book. I felt that it dragged on and the romance wasn't a heart stopping type of connection. I didn't feel that they had any emotional connection and the the parts where emotion was felt,why did they feel that way? I read pretty fast and that allows me to read at least one book a day sometimes more.I don't like to start a book and not finish it. Because of the reviews I hoped that I would see what others saw in this novel but i didn't. Overall I felt the book was waste of my time"
2,From The Ashes,"This book did not have enough depth to it. I enjoyed the characters,however the writers did not put enough romance in the novel. This book should have been catagorized as a mystery, rather than a love story. Maybe they should use this couple again, with more romance involved.Make a sequal."
4,"Great album, though there exists a better remix of Slussen.","Jesper Dahlbäck (aka The Persuader) shows that his production skills are at par with his mixing skills. This album, though, is not mixed.The tracks are excellent... at times techy, at others housey, and at still others ambient, though often an eclectic mix of all three.My only reproach is regarding Slussen, the first track. I would have rather had the Erot remix of the track, which is more slamming. Nonetheless, the original cut is good. Besides, the Erot remix is available on two mixed compilations: Stockholm Mix Sessions (which was mixed by Dahlbäck) on Montreal's Turbo Recordings label and Moving House at Food Club, the fourth release in the Moving House series put out on Belgium's SSR label and compiled and mixed by Geoffroy.This is a great CD and worth the money."
2,No Depth,"This book left me befuddled. What was the point? I was expecting thoughtful essays about the meaning of life, as filtered through the experiences of the author, a psychiatrist. Instead, the book had little more depth than a sixth grader's ""What I did On My Summer Vacation"" essay. I was amazed when Rako spent more time on watching her granddaughter feed birds than she did on the breakup of either of her marrriages.It's a disappointment because Rako's life seems to be a full and vivid one, but little of that wholeness and color made it onto the page. I finished knowing more about her mentor than I did about her."
3,The light at the end of the book,"Although this book is a biography on the life of psychiatrist Susan Rako, I found the most moving content to be in the insights and advice of her mentor Dr. Semrad that Susan shares during the last third of the book. Susan's life story does have its interesting moments, but, I have to admit that the details of her childhood days, life choices, and failed marriages were not nearly as compelling as the insights she passed on from her mentor. For me, these hand-me-down perspectives were the light that got in (the book)."
4,Elegant,"As I was engrossed in reading That's How the Light Gets In, I tried to think of the one world that would describe it, and I think that word is elegant. One expects all kinds of ""dishy"" stuff in memoirs, but in this instance the author artfully circumvented this hazard without skimping on any of her feelings or struggles. I say, Bravo ! I identified in so many places, which made reading this book that much more pleasurable and validating for me. It is a fine piece of literary work."
5,VALE LA PENA PAGAR UN POQUITO MAS,SI TE GUSTA GEARS OF WAR TE GUSTARA ESTA VERSION LA DECIDI COMPRAR YA QUE LA VERSION NORMAL DEL JUEGO EN UN ACCIDENTE SE ME DAÑO. PUEDES VER EN LAS IMAGENES QUE HE GRABADO LO QUE VIENE EN LA CAJA PARA UN COLECCIONISTA ES ALGO QUE DEBES TENER. NO CRITICO EL JUEGO PORQUE PARA QUE HAYAN VENDIDO MAS DE 3 MILLONES DE COPIAS NO HAY MAS PRUEBA DE QUE ES EXCELENTE PARA LOS QUE AMAN LOS JUEGOS DE VIOLENCIA Y DONDE HAY HARTA SANGRE. YO JUGUE EL HALO 3 BETA Y EN MI MODESTA OPINION ESTE JUEGO NO TIENE MEJORES GRAFICOS QUE GEARS. ESPERO QUE LA VERSION DE HISTORIA DE HALO 3 TENGA MEJORES GRAFICOS
3,More fun for hardcore gamers,"As mentioned in my other GOW review, I prefer the first-person HUD perspective rather than over-the-shoulder. I did not like GOW as much as the Halo series."
3,Boring and repetitive,Looks great but once you've seen the first level you've seen it all. Nothing but ducking and shooting with no real atmosphere despite what others say. Save your pennies and check out Rainbow Six Vegas or stick with GRAW.
3,halo game played,this is absurd some magazine compare this game to to Halo engine not even close .very desapointed. the game played more like unreal and residen evil .and to finist checkpiont to checkpoint you have die 5 to 8 times even on easy setting. game is ok but not a halo killer. play on line is 2 minutes section.as soon your 4 team menber die start the new section. not good.
5,Better than Halo 3,"I got this game and wasnt sure if i would like it because i am a pretty big halo fan and i didnt think anything could be better. Gears of War definitly was. The boss battles are insane and the gameplay is absolutly stunning along with the graphics which look great. The online play isnt as great as halo but if youre in the mood for a ""find cover and shoot"" game like Gears of War is than youll definitly love the online play. The story is awesome because it drags you right in and wont let go. A must have for the xbox 360 owner."
5,BEST GAME EVER,"IF YOU ARE LOOKING FOR EXCELLENT GAMEPLAY, AWESOME WAYS TO KILL ENEMIES AND MUCH MORE, BELIEVE ME, I RECOMMEND THIS GAME FOR YOU, I PLAY IT ALONE, ONLINE, I'M STILL IN LOVE WITH THIS GAME, IT'S SO AWESOME AND PERFECTLY DONE THAT IT WILL BLOW YOU'RE MIND.THANKS EIDO FOR AN AMAZING GAME"
3,Good but not great!!!,I saw the full version on TV and this DVD has a lot of parts that are cut. They were essential for viewers to understand somethings on the drama of the soap. It was ok but at times didn't make sense.
3,don't expect the TV version,"I have watched this novella twice on the diffrent channels on TV. I have been looking for the DVD for awhile now and was so suprised when I finally was able to get it. The DVD focuses on mainly Lorena and Sara and of course Alonzo y Ernesto. I agree with the other posts... the editing left out key story plots. I mean it completly left out the sub-stories of Bruno and Diana, Valeria and Arturo, Bettina and Ivan etc... and of course Greta and Don Omar.... So it is a good DVD to add to my collection but as a whole I was disappointed."
3,Instructions were vague,I returned the item rather than damage my wall by experimenting with the vague intructions and poorly drawn examples.I also had trouble with the shipping & return expense. I paid for the UPS return myself. Amazon also deducted for return shipping. I wrote customer sevice and they never responded to my claim. Very dissappointing experience. I buy from Amazon on a regular basis but I will be much more carful before buying in the future.
5,My 1st Dollmaking Book,What a fantastic book. I have used it so much as a reference in my dollmaking that I have the pages falling out of my book. Susanna is so encouraging of your own style of dollmaking. Creative impulse just flows from her book.
1,The locking mechanism gave way,I used this product with my garmin 76CSX GPS to travel across the US on my bicycle (4000 mi). The locking mechanism gave way quite a few times and eventually descending the GPS flew out and got scratched up. I contacted garmin via their E-mail support only to be forwarded to the dreaded 30 minute wait on phone support. Not recommended without additional security feature to hold it in place. $15 product cost me to ruin $300+ product.
4,Works on Motorcycle.,"I bought this for my 2005 Suzuki Boulevard c50 motorcycle. Fits right in between the original risers, center on the handlebar. It rides a little close to the gas tank however that should get better after I install new risers. The plastic is a little flimsy(maybe flexible is a better word) but not enough to worry. The GPS placement is well balanced on this mount. I still loop the GPS through the lanyard around the handlebar before I mount it, just in case."
5,"Works perfectly, genuine Garmin product and cheap","Fit my 700 hybrid bike perfectly, don't know what people are talking about when they say it doesn't fit ""modern"" bars. Secures my Map76 just fine. I had used this exact same mount on a jet ski and it never broke or let the GPS come out."
5,Score!,"This mount is designed for bike handlebars, but I use it on my boat. The very similar boat mount costs 3 or 4 times as much. Finding this was a significant savings. It also demonstrates the way the industry varies its pricing depending on the target consumer. They assume that yachties have way more money than cyclists."
1,This is a great find!,"I have been hunting high and low for these things...they are a gem to find here. I only use natural floss and these ""needles"" allow me to continue flossing with my natural floss....and they are otherwise impossible to find where I live. Highly recommend these if you have a bridge! I really like the container they come in too..one side has holes like a salt shaker so you can dispense one at a time easily."
4,bridgeaid dental floss threader,this product is easier to use than the type they sell in the drug stores. It was delivered very quickly and I am very satisfied with the product and the company. thank you!
3,Common Ground,"I have to admit it, I only bought this CD for 1 song: ""Common Ground,"" because I couldn't find a copy at any retail outlet. I just love the song & I've played it over & over...."
1,"Great when new, getting ready to replace the 2nd one in less than two years","So disappointed that Monroe seems to have quality issues. Bought shocks in April 2010. Left side started leaking badly in January 2011 and car was squirrely to drive on the Interstate. Now in September 2011, the right side is leaking and has reduced damping to make the car unstable.Very dissappointed in Monroe's quality and would not buy again. Frustrated because Bilstein or Koni does not make a shock for the 2002 Pathfinder. Love to buy American, but feel I've been burned on quality."
5,Fun South of the Border,"A Contemporary Mind gives a new perspective on the realities and cultural expectations that thrive in what is considered to be Latin America. The language is exuberant and finely crafted to draw the reader into a web of multiple plots. Well worth the time and effort. Great book for the beach, a must summer read."
1,uneven offerings,"This CD offers mostly a stitched-on amalgam of mediocre tunes at best.It bears no comparison to the first volume.The songs sound half-baked,stilted in electronic paucity,as if made by music students showcasing new electronic gizmos."
3,"Average, Mediocre, Mundane","Cesar Franck's work requires an organist with elan, brio, and stamina. Someone like Virgil Fox. Ms. Marie-Claire Alain, the organist in this sorry work, is an adequate parish organist; she does not do Cesar any credit.The recording (before CDs) is from 1976 and the microphones were positioned badly; one can hear the foot-pedal stops 'clacking' in the recording.The organ is either very old or badly mantained; the organ is from the church of Saint Francis of Sales in Lyon and apart from a noisy pump motor there is unintended vibrato in the high pitch reeds.BUT since there are very few recordings of Cesar Franck's organ works one has to put up with what is out there."
4,Great tire!,Purchased tire for wife's old Miyata 310... rides wonderful. Seems like a quality product at a great price. May order another set.
4,great product! Excellent BASS,"this product is an excellent product it had great bass and it is desighned to fit you perfectly the ear pieces move to fit your head also the sound quality is great but the picture on amazon is somewhat misleading it does not come with sound contol on the headphones and it doesnt come with the dapter shown in the picture, and it does not weigh 5 pound it is less than 1 pound, but it has great sound and i would recommend it to anyone"
1,What a way to die!,"This book is dreadful. I bought it because I'm a fan of detectives from around the world. But Garcia-Roza switches from third-person, to first person, and back again. Why does he do it? Because he couldn't figure out how to plot the book around Inspector Espinoza's own discoveries. That's because during the entire book, the detective doesn't really find anything out at all. It all gets wrapped up through no fault of his own... The worse part, however, is the scene where a beautiful young woman finds herself handcuffed to a bed with a bad guy and decides that the only way to get out of her tricky situation is to have sex with the villain until the excitement kills him. Which it does. But not until the beautiful girl has really enjoyed the sex, though she hates herself for it. Maybe that could happen in Rio, after all it's the land of the string bikini, but I doubt it very much. Absolute nonsense."
4,Silence of the Rain,"I found the book quite entertaining. Unfamiliar as I was with the locale the author succeded in establishing for us a genuine a sense of place.Those familiar with the use of up-to-date criminalistics in their police procedurals won't find them here. Against endemic corruption and third world methods the author offers us a detective who is at once humane, uncorruptible and and even noble. The novel moved along rapidly and the plot resolved itself logically.Those looking for a polite mystery may find this book gratuitously sensual and violent.I found the primitivity added authenticity. My one reservation was that I did not find the last scene credible. Those who watch the show 1000 Ways to Die might might find it entertaining. I found it simply bizarre."
4,Good DVD. Informative.,I love Best Motoring except for one thing. They think Japanese cars are the be all end all of motoring. If they could keep from being so biased it would be perfect.
3,not completely useless,"A variety of disconnected insights that have something to do with the Book of Job- some fairly interesting, others that went out of my head as quickly as they passed in. But having buried Safire, let me praised him: he does describe the Job story in a reasonably entertaining way, and he does coherently address the key issue raised by the book: how people respond to the world's injustice, and how (according to the book of Job) God responds to humanity's response. This could have been an excellent 30 page magazine article instead of a so-so 200 page book. But Safire writes well enough, and is fair-minded enough, to make even a so-so book readable."
3,Ok,Kodak 1131549 Premium InkJet Matte Greeting Cards (20 Sheets) is just heavier stock paper - not great for greeting cards but the only thing the Kodak printer prints ok on. If you buy a Kodak printer you need to use Kodak paper.
2,Heel is Too Far back,"The shoe has many excellent features as I wrote in my review when I first purchased the boot. However, because the heel is aligned behind the foot rather than under the heel of the foot, the heel of the shoe splayed after only a couple of months of wear. I had to throw them away. It broke my heart for such an expensive item from a reputable company. They were broken and unfixable."
2,Cheaply made,"I was really surprised on the how badly the boots were made. First just with the Clark name reputation I had assumed the boots were at least going to be comfortable. No cushioning that I could feel that could hardly last an entire work day. The heel felt like it could easily be pulled from the bottom. And last but most importantly, the look of the boot just looked cheap and I wore my pair twice, then instead of going through the hassle of shipping back and getting my money, I unfortunately gave them to the goodwill and some poor soul who has hardly any money may end up wasting their money on these awful boots. But I still like ""clark"" made shoes but I will be careful in what I order from their name brand from now on."
5,great comfy shoes,very stylish and comfortable. what you'd expect from Clarks [but a tad more stylish than most]. cut half a size bigger - order half a size down..
2,Rocking Chair Fustration,"As usual the chair arrived ahead of time. Down hill from there. The parts list was on the top half and the exploded drawing was on the bottom. Too much info in to little space. Made things very hard to make read and make out.This chair had metal inserts which you screwed the bolts in to assemble.Two of these stripped out during the process,nothing that contact cement did not repair.After finally getting it together after much to long,I sat down to enjoy it. Very comfortable chair,felt solid. After two days I started to rise from the chair,placing my hands on the armrest,the left side collasped,breaking the left rocker and front stretchers (top & bottom) and the seat cushion came loose. I am not going to return it,but I am goinig to put it back together with braces because I LIKE it.But I will not order from the Coaster Co. again(amazon LLC.)"
3,mission style rocking chair,"The chair is of medium quality and lacks padding in the back. It is a good value for the price however. I would not repurchase,but would look for a higher quality. Trying to reach shipper for delivery information was impossible."
2,very disappointed,The back of the rocker is constructed of cardboard and staples....it is falling apart from just sitting in it. It doesn't even look nice anymore. I would recommend this to no one.
4,Nice Looking Rocker,We got two of these for our new ranch property. They were fairly easy to assemble and look great. They rock well and with a footstool are comfortable enough. They are a bit tall for a small person unless there is a footstool to rest on.
3,Not very good quality,"One rocker appeared to have been broken, and then glued back together. Would recommend a different source for those looking for a quality product."
2,Falling apart,Arms are already coming apart. So disappointed. As you're rocking the arm rest disconnects from back of the chair. Have to keep tapping it back into place.
4,"Recieved Damaged, but Company Sent the Replacement Parts and Everything is Fine","I am retired and I build furniyure for fun.So while looking for info on Rocking Chairs, this one came up. Not a bad chair for the money, I'm happy and now I have a real chair to look at when I'm deigning my own.The chair was received with major damaged on both side pieces (Yes you do have to assemble it.) Several e-mail were exchanged with the importer. I attached photos as requested, and after one more follow up e-mail they sent me the replacements for the damaged sides and had the forethought to include the other pieces that fit those side. (Each chair is not exactly the same, the holes and dowel locations are sloghtly different and if they had just send the sides I would noy have been able to assemble the chair, GOOD JOB)"
2,unhappy,"I couldn't wait to get this good looking rocker, it looked very sturdy and strong but looks are deciving.The chair is falling apart and has to be fixed every week. The problem seems to be with the parts put together by the company. The thin wood braces in the seat snapped, the screws keep falling out of the chair no matter how tight they are put in, the squeeking noise it makes every time it is used is very annoying and when the company put in the nuts they split the wood and repaired it with wood glue and still mailed the part with the chair to use, what kind of workmanship is this? I purchased the chair in October 2011 and it wasn't put together until the 1st week of December 2011 since it was a christmas gift and we have had all this trouble since then. Right now it is in our basement being taken apart piece by so it can be put back together with thicker wood and glued back together. My husband wants to box it all up and send it back, said it isn't worth the money we paid for it."
1,"Poor design, engineering, quality...","I spent an hour putting this chair together and my husband was able to sit in it for 5 minutes before the bottom rocker split in half where they jointed it together. Why would they joint the wood in the most pressure sensitive area of the chair??? I will also add that my husband is 5'9"" and weighs 165 lbs. so it was not an overweight issue that caused the chair to break. When I sat in it at my 5'4"" height I had to arch my back and sit toward the front of it to even get it to rock. The center of gravity is off with this rocker so if you are my height and purchase this chair you will find yourself sitting on the edge of the seat the whole time. This was given to me as a gift, therefore I didn't have any say as to whether I wanted it or not. Take the advice from the reviews, save your money, and spend it on a chair that is worth it."
1,Changed my mind...,"I have been looking a long time to replace a chair that I owned years ago that belonged to my great Uncle. It looks very similar to this. But after reading the reviews, I think I will skip this heartache! Thank you, Previous Reviewers for your honesty!"
4,very pleased,"I bought this for xams. It is very nice and okay quality, have a mission chair for my husband, not as matched but was worth the price."
2,chair is great but broke,so the chair is great love it.. but after like 2-3monts of use the back leather part is broken.. it fixable.. but what a pain i thought i was going to get a quality chair for the price.
4,Comfortable,"This is a quality chair, comfortable yet not heavy. Compared with its excellent craftsmanship, the price is actually a bargain. The chair is wide enough to sit a big size person"
1,Biggest mistake ever!,"I had written a bad review on this product which has since disappeared, interesting. In less than 1 week, the factory constucted parts came apart, bolts did not fit from the beginning and I soon got a call from the distributers. I offered to give back the chair if they gave me an all factory constructed chair or my money back. They said they had to talk to the manufacturers. They also said they have sold hundreds of these chairs and had no bad reviews. LIARS! This is a bad product put together with a wish. Save your money. I also never heard from the company again. It would make good firewood. I disassembles itself!"
1,Not very good constructionb,"I purchased this chair and it will not stay together. After using a super adhesive and re-tightening the bolts, chair will quickly get loose. I will buy another chair but not from this seller."
2,not so great,"The shipping was very quick but the chair arrived with broken dowels that had to be replaced, and one of the rockers is missing a hole that will have to be drilled. Parts of the instructions are written backwards and one of the pieces is cut wrong. Bummer. Luckily, my folks have the tools and knowledge to take care of these defects, if they didn't, I would send it back."
4,All you karate big guys are SO defensive!,"My daughter is in karate and my son used to be. This toy is a fun thing for them to do at home. Nobody's promising that your child is going to become a karate master from this video, but at least it motivates them to move and practice things at home. The karate community is so defensive and certain people are ridiculous. I appreciate the control and discipline karate teaches my child, and realize that isn't going to come from this toy, but if you look at the review from one of the people that reviewed this, you will see that she has reviewed products she has never even seen in person. Bottom line, this is fun at home for your kid."
2,"Good toy, but only should be seriously used to give a child something to do.","Now, I'm not going to be like some of the reviewers and say that the store owners who sell this should commit hari kari or that this is the greatest toy in the world. I just want to make a few comments about this product. I would definitly agree with many of the other reviewers about how it is a FUN toy, not something to really train off of. But I disagree how they mention that it will get the child up and moving, because without proper guidance or instruction, the child will not understand how to move and exercise properly. If you are planning on purchasing this toy, I would just like to remind you that it WILL NOT protect your child if he is to be attacked by a bully in school, nor will it make him more active. It will, however, give him a good time trying to imitate the moves shown on the DVD.If you are only planning for this product to be a toy, i would recommend it, otherwise, please do not purchas it."
3,"A Passable Introduction, but Certainly Not Comprehensive","The DVD seemed entertaining and moderately informative, if a bit simplified. The bag is fairly sturdy for a child. As a product, it is passable.Please consider this merely an entry point to the martial arts for your child. It is certainly not a comprehensive system and cannot under any circumstances substitute for ongoing martial arts instruction. It will not provide the level of expertise or, more importantly, the self-confidence, discipline and respect that such training does.Frankly, while this product does what it says, I'm concerned about children misusing the techniques they learn from it.If your child is at all interested in studying the martial arts, you may be better off skipping the Home Studio DVD and using that time to pay a visit to some local schools in an effort to find a suitable facility straight away.Good luck, and please, if you purchase this product, be sure your child enjoys it, but also be aware of its limitations. :)"
4,A toy that really kicks butt!,"My nine year old loves this toy. He is so into electronics that I thought I'd never get him away from video games. With this toy he still gets to stay inside in front of the T.V., but he is getting excercise which I love and learning basic karate which he loves."
2,Not for anyone wanting real training,"I bought this set for my son's sixth birthday. He and my ten year old had seen it advertised, and wanted one. They have both had a small amount of training in karate, so I thought it would be fun. We were completely disappointed when we played the dvd. It is geared towards very young children, with tacky cartoon characters. The kick bag is very flimsy, and is not appropriate for any real training. The entire set quickly ended up in the back of the closet, not being used. I did some searching, and found a karate dvd for children, for a lower price, that is much higher quality.Do not waste your money on this kit. I would not recommend it for anyone over three years old."
1,Poor Customer Service,I did not receive my complete order. I only received the DVD and not the Punch Bag. If there is a problem with the product description the buyer should not suffer. The order should be honored as is and the seller should deal with it as a separate matter with Amazon.
4,My Kids Love This Toy - Fun 30 minute video,"Two boys, 5 and 7 have this toy. They both love it. Good exercise, High Energy, Promotes (mildly) self esteem, and a couple karate moves. Buy it and you'll be singing the song of the ""Crimson Sausage"" like me... What could possibly top that?"
5,Gives expensive joggers a run for their money!,"This will be my second Tike Tech purchase. I previously purchased a Tike Tech Double T on Craigslist that I loved, but it was stored outdoors by the previous owner and the straps broke due to exposure/dry rot. After getting my money's worth from that one, I just purchased a second one. They are a GREAT jogger. It really annoys me when people give bad reviews to joggers with a fixed wheel, as that's what JOGGERS have - fixed wheels. They are meant for running and are easier to maneuver when used at speeds faster than walking. They are bulky and not meant to be used as convenience strollers. So, if you are looking for a good JOGGER, this brand is PERFECT! Lightweight, durable, safe, easy to maneuver when jogging, great storage. I couldn't ask for a better product. I wouldn't spend money on Baby Jogger or B.O.B. when you could get a Tike Tech for a couple hundred dollars cheaper."
4,Awesome,"We've had this product for 2 years now and it's withstood tons of abuse, beach use, running, etc. I gave 4 stars because we've had to have the spokes adjusted a couple times, but overall great. We've even recommended our neighbors who also purchased."
1,Heavy and Huge,I hated this stroller. It was so huge and super heavy. With only one toddler in it I couldn't even make a turn without having to put all my strength into it. It was awful. I immediately sent it back to Amazon.
5,Great Textile Resource,"This book is a great resource for the Indian textile researcher. The pictures are well-done and the analysis is very competent. Ms. Barnes is very skilled at clearly stated what can be known and what can be conjectured from an analysis of these textiles. As a budding textile researcher I found her analysis both informative, and comprehensive. It certainly isn't a light a read, but the clear explanations make it possible for even a beginner to gain knowledge from this book."
4,"Great product, sloppy packaging","A hard to find preshave, this item smells subtly delicious. However, when a bottle of it opens in transit, it's not so subtle. The flip-top bottles were not secured in any way. A piece of tape on each bottle would have made all the difference. Manufacturer replaced it quickly."
2,Don't completely understand,I ordered this book after reading about some successes of weight loss but so much of the recipes are in a form of english or british and I wasn't familiar with some of the ingredients needed soooooooo. Its okay but I think I will move on. Just my opinion.
5,Peak Goodman,"This recording captures the Benny Goodman band neatly straddling the swing era and post-swing big band modernism. The Mel Powell, Buck Clayton and Eddie Sauter arrangements are crisp and dynamic, with a lot more substance than dance band music. Really more ""jazz"" than ""swing"". Not many familiar faces in the band lineup; Kai Winding on trombone, Stan Getz on tenor, and Peggy Lee vocals stand out when I scan the lineups. Benny seems to be having the time of his life. I suspect he favored playing with these more complex arrangements to rehashing ""Sing, Sing, Sing"" and it's many cousins. I've listened to a lot of Goodman, this one holds up to many repeat listenings more than any I've encountered. For swing era arrangements, I prefer to go to the source (Chick Webb, Fletcher Henderson), but this stuff is quite unique."
5,Another Masterpiece From JLT,Another great release from JLT. All the songs are great. His voice has never sounded better. If you liked the usual supsects the you will love sunstorm. Enjoy.
3,GOOD ENOUGH-NOT GREAT,"THIS IS A GOOD CD, BUT IT IS SIMPLY NOT A GREAT ONE.JLT IS A GREAT VOCALIST & THIS IS A CD THAT IS EASY TO LISTEN TO,BUT IT IS REALLY A MELODIC ONE. GLAD I BOUGHT IT, BUT WAS A LITTLE DISAPPOINTED."
2,Like Reading by a Yellow Bug Porch Light,"If you want a light bulb for reading - don't buy this bulb. If you want to know how well this light bulb is to read by, put one of the yellow bug light bulbs in your lamp.I didn't give this bulb a one star because they aren't going to be wasted. Either I sell them after the ban goes into effect or they will be used as porch lights.UPDATE: I purchased American made Aero Tech light bulbs. They work great."
1,I was sent 100w bulbs instead of 60w,Wrong wattage bulbs sent. My order clearly stated 60W. I am not up for the return process. Dissapointed since I still need 60W bulbs.
2,weird,"First of all this is NOT A PARAMETRIC EQ! It is not even a ""quasi parametric"" or ""semi parametric"" EQ. It's not even really a 7 band EQ. A parametric EQ allows you to adjust the frequency center and bandwidth, this only allows you to boost or cut the gain. there are separate EQ's for front and rear, but they're set at different frequency - wierd. The sub crossover is at 32hz, 64hz, or 132hz, a 80-90hz setting would have been more useful. all in all, I sent mine back. I wish Amazon would carry the PWM 20 as it has better features."
1,Did not work,Did not work Correctly Right out-of-the-box . The front output did not work . I sent it back for a full refund . Amazon was great about it !
5,2 Thumbs up,"This book gives a new prespective on learning emergency medicine from many of the books already out there. It is great for step 2, the 4th year EM elective and as a review for residents."
5,Painting Animals on Rocks,"The craft book titled ""Painting Animals on Rocks"" was exactly what I was wanting. It came to me in a timely manner and in good condition. Thank you for the quick service."
4,amazing art full of fun!,"It is amazing and lots of fun! This book especially for beginners. A lot of stone painting project is explained step by step with pictures and patterns. I have already picked up a lot of stone and already have bought acrylic paints, i am starting my first project tomorrow! I beleive painting animals on stones will be very easy and amazing with this BOOK!"
5,Have fun painting rocks.,The book is in good condition and contains many fun ideas with easy to follow instructions. Can't wait to try them.
5,Nice Booki,I love this book and look forward to using it. I have always had a fascination with paintings on rocks so this book is justwhat I needed to excite me.I got a nice book and delivery was fast. Thanks! I highly recommend you.
5,A wonderful book on learning to paint realistic animals.,This book taught me how to paint wild animal fur. It goes from a dark to light technique and can be done on just about any surface besides smooth rock. It's very good at the basics of drawing animal features too.
5,Excellent book that taught me how to paint,"I have no natural artistic talent, except for coloring inside the lines. This book, however, changed that. Lin Wellford's instructions are clear, concise, and very easy to understand. Her step-by-step directions are fool-proof, even for someone like me who has never attempted painting, let alone a furry animal. The pages are loaded with pictures to help demonstrate the techniques discussed. It's also an easy read written in layman's terms. I've painted several bunnies, cats,fawns, racoons, lady bugs and snakes. Except for the snakes, everything I painted looked ""real,"" not like cartoons. I get better with each new rock and have started to use some of the alternative variations that are briefly described for more advanced artists. Whether you're a beginner like me or a great painter already, I believe you'd enjoy every project. I would recommend this book to my friends."
3,Some of the finished products shown don't match with the instructions,"The Owl instructions produce the owl that is on the top of page 99 not the large white owls on the bottom of the page.also the rabbits, the instructions produce the rabbit with black lines under the nose, not white,as shown in the finished bunny."
1,What a piece of crap,"You may lose your life burning to death using this p.o.s., BUT... It's says ""Eco"" and ""Environmentally Friendly"" on the label so it must be just wonderful. The label also says it complies with U.S. EPA government regulation so that must make it even more special.Do yourself a favor and buy the No-Spill brand or drop some real coin and get an old-time metal can. These too are now not as good or safe as they could be due to government regulation, but they sure beat this piece of crap. I still have the taste of gasoline in my mouth from blowing in the spout to determine if it was open or closed. This Scepter Eco can is useless for handling gasoline as well as wasteful and dangerous. About the only use I have for this container is to pee in it if I get in a pinch."
1,Terrible beyond words,"Bought four of these things recently and none of the ""no spill"" spouts work right. Not one. No matter what I try, they will not flow. The one thing they will do is leak all over your hands. And just to be clear, I have watched the manufacturer's video on how to work the new style spout several times. I would return them all for a refund except that they are already filled with gasoline.The only real option you'll have is to pour the gasoline out of the can without using the spout. This often makes for a very dangerous mess, but it DOES work. A funnel helps in some (but not all) cases.Bottom line: This product is dangerous and near totally useless. It is terrible beyond words. The manufacturer should be ashamed."
1,Spout failure,"I didn't find the product hard to use at all. In fact, I found the spout operation pretty handy.But...The problem is that the mechanism that locks and unlocks the spout is very weak and prone to failure.Mine failed the third time I used it.I'm going to write the manufacturer for a new spout.I'd recommend you stay away from this product."
1,Scepter Eco gas can assembly and use.,I agree with all other reviews. Horrible product. I was worried that I was defective until I read all of the negative reviews!
1,Design - Beyond Stupid,"I cannot believe this product was every manufactured. The ""child resistant"" device for releasing the gas is extremely difficult to use. I am throwing this piece of over engineered garbage where it belongs - in the garbage."
1,Unvented fuel container!,"This unit was not designed for a vapor producing liquid. There is NO VENT on this container. If you leave it in the sun for a few minutes with the spout in the stored position, you'll find a balloon shaped gas can. You can imagine what kind of nightmare this could cause if it heated up and ruptured in your garage..."
1,inaccurate dimensions listed,the dimensions listed for this can are inaccurate as it is larger than what is listed therefore will NOT fit into a 9x12 can holder!!
1,"Horrible, frustrating and dangerous","We spent close to a half hour trying to figure this spout out - googled several different sets of instructions, watched a video and finally ended up (sort of) getting it open. The gentleman who said ""recycle the spout"" before putting fuel in it was spot on. The only way to use it is direct pour, and with no vent, it becomes a splashy, sloppy and dangerous procedure. I wouldn't give it a single star if I didn't have to in order to voice my opinion...."
2,Good movie!,"Sometimes it's a little weird, and the plot is also weird, but good movie! You should watch it...if you can get it."
1,Extremely Misleading,"Don't fall for the misleading title of this product. These are in no way ""giant"" truffles! You are paying $15 for two standard-sized truffles, which is extremely steep, regardless of how good they might be. Don't know why the term ""giant"" is used in relation to this product, but given the price, it certainly makes you believe you are getting more than you actually get."
5,Great!!!!,I am an aunt and have no kids of my own but this little book was recommended to me by a close friend. Love it!!!! This is a very well written children's book. I have oh so much fun reading it to my nieces. Good plot and the rhyming was terrific. I thought Dr. Suess was great. Move over... this author is unbelievably talented. I thoroughly enjoyed reading the story and think it has great characters and a nice ending.
5,Wonderful Book!,This is a wonderful book! You can't help but feel for the characters even though you know there is no way for them to be together in the end. The ending makes you want to cry with sadness and in joy at the same time. I must read no matter what kind of romance you like.
3,Slightly disappointed,"The product is what is advertised so I should not have been disappointed but I was expecting something slightly different. I have another tall six drawer piece that has a wood top with drawers that have slight variations in color and are lacquered so as not to pinch, which also makes for easy cleaning. This is not that same product although the frame is the same. The top of the cabinet is solid wicker so it does make it awkward to put things on it. It is a solid color with no lacquer so I cannot run my hand across it without getting pinched. It does however serve its purpose. The only hard part about assembly were the drawers. I did find a way to put them together relatively easy. If you insert both screws on one side of the frame first, then slide the bottom piece in the screws, you are able to line up the opposite side and finish it off. Once I realized that it went fairly quickly. All in all I would say it is a good piece for the price and does look nice."
3,Useful and pretty enough for extra storage,"This chest does the job for extra storage but is not the same quality as a piece of furniture. It's sturdy enough for clothes and light item storage. It was first shipped without the hardware and the tabletop piece had a stain on it, but the company was very good about shipping out new pieces."
4,good item !!!!,I like them alot but they are a little bit smaller than I expected. They really help me to organize my bedroom since I now have to sleep on the main floor of my since my disability problems came up.
4,good chest,"It looks like the picture, easy to assemble and does what it's supposed to do so I'm happy. Item shipped fast which was great cause I really needed the extra storage."
5,Iron Wicker Storage Chest,"This chest is very well made, and was very easy to assemble. I rec'd. it super fast and it was packaged very well. I would recommend this purchase to others."
2,sticking baskets,"While I like the baskets, I had to throw away the chest and the baskets were a bit to big for the chest and it was difficult to move the baskets in and out. Not the 'desk drawer' substitute I was hoping for."
5,As good as D.I. gets,"Classic album that satisfies from start to finish. Often confused with the Thrasher Mag skate-rock band Drunk Injuns, D.I. is must for every record collection (Drunk Injuns aren't bad either, but you would have to shell out over $200 on ebay to get their record). In spite of many bands reforming to cash in on the punk revival, D.I. is also credited for being the ONLY 80's punk band that never broke up and kept churning out discs. BUY THIS DISC NOW!!"
4,Good band. Great front man. Too often ignored.,"SO much bad music gets name dropped and hyped in all the Spin music magazines from the ""now classic"" 80's LA punk era. Then albums like this one go unnoticed.D.I. has a great frontman. He can sing half-decent, but his standout strength is in attitude/charisma. Casey's vocals have a deep sardonic humor in them. There is sharp teeth on his lyrics, but you as a listener are invited to laugh with him. Some D.I. songs are these nasty slabs of gloom and doom and others are wickedly sarcastic. Casey Royer is an interesting character too often ignored in the history of punk.D.I. made good records. This one is probably the most well known, though none are really all that inferior. If people are going to swoon over a crummy Germs ""re-union"" then D.I. deserves a 4 star rating.Pick up Horse Bites and make an iTunes mix w/ old Suicdal and Black Flag. You'll be set up and ""germ free""."
5,Finally! What D.I. stands for,"An excellent CD, D.I. being the aftermath of the Adolescents. After about fove years, i found out the ""D.I."" stands for the Drunk Injuns. Isn't that great?"
5,nice-old school component,"A sweet receiver with a big volume knob, a phono pre-amp, and no provision for ""video"" inputs. This is for record players and other stereo RCA-jack-equipped audio components. Nothing that would surprise a guy who bought his last stereo in the 1980s--I should know. Sound is fantastic. It has a couple of knobs and buttons I haven't had before, but I understand what they do and they are truly useful. Having bought this, I look forward to stubbornly refusing to upgrade my gear (or own a television) for another two decades. Music! Music!"
4,Supports Yamaha Reputation,"The ""raw direct"" button simply bypasses the front panel controls, so you can quickly switch back and forth to see what you have done to a sound. The continuous ""Loudness"" knob is just a midrange control. The more ""loudness"" you use, the more you have to turn the ""volume"" back up. OK--I just feel it's a little over-marketed. This unit seems to support Yamaha's reputation for conservative specs. The quality is excellent, the tuner sensitivity fantastic, and the 50 watts per channel seems more like 75. It performs as represented."
3,Yamaha RX-397 AM/FM Stereo,"My not so old (10y) old Technics receiver gave out suddenly, and I needed a replacement with a phonograph input and would work with two old Dynaco speakers. The Yamaha seemed a modest unit at a modest price which filled the bill. I works OK, although I find the setup for station presets is awkward, and the tone quality is not as full bodied as with the Technics. (I play mostly classical music, instrumental and vocal.) Also, it seems to me that the sound of speech doesn't have the clarity desired---distortion present?.I'm modestly satisfied with my purchase, but not impressed. These kinds of stereo receivers seem to be going out of style in favor of fancier ones to be used with video and surround sound (with no phono input)."
3,Ok shaver,The charge last for about 3 or 4 shaves for me. It takes a little to long for me to shave with it. I'm not sure if I like the smartfoil or not. When I'm finished and I wash my face I seem to really notice where I missed. Then I have to let my face dry and shave over the missed spots. I also have to press a bit to hard in some spots. Does ok on the neck. It doesn't irritate my skin which I like. Over all it is a good quality shaver with an ok shave.
4,It works,"A no frills shaver.You will not get a super close shave, but close enough for me.I had the same shaver previously and it lasted for about 6 years. The blades started falling off and the foil was starting to disentegrate - but that's after 6 years, so I wasn't unhappy with it lasting this long.For the price- it seems like a good deal.I did a lot of hunting around online and did not find it cheaper anywhere."
2,Doesn't live up to the Braun name,"I would have given this 3 stars if it were any other brand and I was expecting marginal quality, but shame on Braun for slapping their name on this product not worthy of their reputation.This was the third Braun shaver I've owned over the past 20 or so years, but didn't live up to the reputation. I've had it for over two years and it's never given me that great of a shave. It's even worse now that the battery is prematurely dying and the blade is getting dull. I'm not going to waste money getting the replacement foil and blade. In fact, I'm replacing it with another Braun, but not a bargain BINO (Braun In Name Only) this time."
4,Update,DVD arrived safely and securely and timeously. Enjoy learning and practicing the Wild Goose routines and to spending time each year with teacher.
4,Insightful - but wish it had more info on the writers,"This is a wonderful book. I came to know of it when I bought the calendar of the same name, which had some of the pictures from the book. My disappointment came when I realized that the calendar was much better. In the calendar you are treated with great information on the writers themselves in addition to their quotes. In the book, you only get the quotes. But regardless, it is a book I keep by my desk at all times, reminding me day and night, that I am not alone in my quest."
2,Good but not enough. . .,"Yes, indeed, it is enthralling to see such writers at work or just sitting around getting ready to work or just sitting around but for the hefty price tag, the small number included here can only be considered stingy at best. Unfortunately, the text often adds little, if any, relevant commentary on the picture at hand. It is interesting though to see the domestic surroundings of so many famous people and I suppose that the voyeur in us receives some satisfaction. The photography itself is well done and captures the look of the writers as we've come to know them through other photos. Since there are only 58 subjects out of a possible 1500 that the author has taken, I was able to read the whole book and look at the photos in sixteen minutes. Before you buy, check it out in a library first to make sure you want to spend you hard earned money on such a minuscule offering."
4,This man writes music that speaks to your soul,"Walk with me is totally excellent It only provides proof that this composer can talk directly to our souls, throough his music, if you have this one go and get the others. Desires of the Heart, Culture come to mind and enjoy the rush of emotions they stir. Thank you Chris."
4,Carries me away,"""Where Angels Fly"" is beautiful and romantic. I don't buy much music, but I have this one and love it."
4,Step by Step Action Plan for Web Wannabees,"With all the hype around easy money on the internet it's easy to get caught up in paying large amounts of money for the ""secret"" to internet success. In this guide, award-winning writer Peggi Ridgway provides essential basic information on defining your target market, search engine friendly web design and how to market your site yourself once it's live.If you are going to hire an expert to build your website, you still want to know what they are talking about and the information and direction you need to provide them, to get the best result.Successful Website Marketing gives easily understandable instructions and provides worksheets that if used are invaluable to those just starting out on the web or those who have a site that no one finds."
3,for newbies,"If you are new to internet marketing and like to fill in forms, then this book will be good you. Some of the ideas are out of date."
1,Was This Rewritten?,"I purchased a new ""used"" book with this title, but authored by Wanda Jankowski, ISBN 0-86636-142-1, no print date but a copyright date of 1991. This book gives wonderful ideas for anyone who's just won the Lotto (with Powerball) and needs ideas for decorating and lighting their new multimillion-dollar mansion. It's utterly useless for those of us with more ordinary ""how-do-I-light-the-bath"" needs. I've tossed the book in the trash. Buyers beware."
1,Poor quality on Canon S800 printer,"The paper says it works with all brands of inkjet printer. I went to Kodak's website and set up my printer settings exactly as instructed for my printer (Canon S800). Even though this paper is very white, smooth, and glossy (all good things), the print quality of the output is significantly inferior to comparably priced Epson Photo Paper and Canon Glossy Photo Paper. Needless to say, I am very disappointed with the print quality. I can see lots of the individual pixels, especially on human flesh. Now I am stuck with a 50-sheet pack of expensive, nearly unusable paper. If you have a Canon S800 printer, stay away from this paper!"
1,Black ink bad,The black ink will not dry properly on this paper.After 24 hours of drying time it still sticks to the photo album pages. Called Kodak they said it was HP ink that we are using. I will not use Kodak again.
2,Too much red on photos printed from HP PSC 2210,"I used it on my HP PSC 2210 multifunction machine with 6-ink photo printing. The photos come out with too much red. The HP premium photo paper, on the other hand, produced photos that look exactly like the once developed in the local 1-hour photo lab. In short, avoid the Kodak premium photo paper if you have HP printers."
5,Clubland praises,"I would like to thank Mr. Owen for illuminating the dark underworld of the NYC club scene in the 90s. I found ""Clubland"" a very interesting, accurate, and emotional account of the forces at play during that decade. As a NYC native, this book resonated with my first hand experiences with Limelight, Tunnel, and Palladium. I commend the author on the thoroughness of this undertaking. I simply could not put the book down!"
5,"Drugs, Decadence & Murder","Awesome book. Frank Owen really gets down into the nitty gritty details and names names like no one I've ever seen before. I live in NYC and have been to the Limelight many times as well as the Palladium and various other dens of iniquity (RIP Coney Island High - the best scene ever) and his version of the needle hits the vein right on. I felt like I was reading a transcription of the scene and the vibe that was just like being there.I was so caught up in the book and all of the details that when I finished it, I went online to VillageVoice.com and looked up a bunch of Owen's other articles. This guy and his book are killer!By the way, I miss those days, but if you search NYC there are still a few great spots, just not on the size and scale of the Limelight...Guiliani could shut down clubs, but he couldn't kill off the spirit."
2,Obvious Bias,"I was surprised to learn that Fran Owen is/was a journalist, given how badly this is written. On top of that, he comes off as having a chip on his shoulder.I was hoping this would be more of an objective read and less about his pent up anger towards someone (Alig). Too bad. It could have been a really good read."
5,It crowns my F250 super duty!,This makes my tough looking truck even tougher! I wish I got these earlier!Easy to install with a Philips screwdriver. Comes with amber lights.
1,The paper [bad],"Using CANON S750, the outcome is terrible. It is dark and blur. Canon's Photo Paper Pro, or Kadak's Premium Photo Paper did produce high-quality pictures, almost no different from the photo developed in a lab."
3,Go for a higher quality paper,"I got this paper for Christmas. Although the value pricing is quite competitive, this is probably the bare minimum quality paper I would ever print on.I use an HP photo printer, and I'd basically stay with HP paper in the future.If you're looking for basic, low cost printing, then this is your paper."
1,Very bad results with Epson 820,"Don't expect to get good picture quality with this paper if you have an Epson Photo 820 printer. I tried differents settings, including those suggested by Kodak, and always got very bad results."
5,Kodak Paper,"This item was as described, worked well and shipped quickly. This purchase was a good experience. I would buy again."
2,Lacks Instructions,Not for beginners. Dance instructors do not explain moves or demonstrate well. Thankful that I did not pay full price. I ended up ordering DanceXfitness and found that to be much more fun and easier to do.
3,"okay, but not great","This DVD is okay---however, the coordination required is a little above my level. From reading the description, I thought I could do it--so I am a little disappointed. Probably, I just am a ""Dancing With the Stars"" wannabe!"
4,Mixed feelings,I love the workouts. Butsome of the movements are so fast it's difficult to keep up.One of the DvD's didn't work at all. Sent it back 2 or more weeks ago and still have not received a replacement. So I'm not very happy with SMV.
3,Core Rhythms,"The video itself, is self explanatory on how to do the steps/exercises. I have enjoyed it tremendously. The only thing I have not liked is there is a line and video camera image across the top that covers part of their faces. I have not figured out how to make this image disappear. I actually is kind of annoying."
2,Not what I expected,I want to start by saying that the Kick Start DVD that I received was a faulty CD. It would not play completely and froze every 5-10 seconds. I now understand what some previous reviews have stated about this DVD. One of the women's accent is very thick and it is difficult to follow her instructions. I have had some dance training before so I thought I could manage but her directions were unclear and she had the dance moves that are very fast paced so that was difficult in and of itself. I found myself skipping her parts and only doing the dance moves that Jaana taught. You can actually feel your core working when you are doing the slow to medium tempo moves. I think I'll go back to belly dancing.
1,Core Rhythms Dane Exercise,This product has not delivered to me. Although the purchased amount has been taken from my account. Can you help?
4,My wife lost 3 inches in 4 weeks,"She is only a beginner for latin dance, and she even admits that she may not be doing it right. But she lost 1 inch in waist in 4 weeks. For my wife, that is a lot, since she is only 100 lbs and 5 foot tall. She even lost a pound in the process. So, she thinks this is more potent than other things she tried(ie, electric belt, Hawaiian dance moves, and such)She loves the red hair lady, and is looking forward to doing this everyday.But the dance Disc is not necessary, they should have put one more disc with better stuff inside."
4,great fun! and a good workout,i love this workout! it is different and fun and i actually sweated. You have to work hard to do it correctly! Not that hard to understand like some reviews said!
4,purchased as a gift,This book was purchased as a gift for a reader who enjoys BLOOD MERIDIEN. He likes this companion book.
5,A o.k. Camcorder for us....,I got this camcorder for my fiance and I for Christmas and so far we have like it a lot. We are still learning how to use all the features but it is pretty easy to figure out the basics (even without reading the manual). I really like the side vision feature because it makes it really easy to see what you're tapeing. Get it!
2,Not a technical introduction...,"This book is not a technical introduction to AI. The book is targeted at people with no technical or computing expertise, and does not have enough depth to be of value to anyone interested in AI from a technical angle.That said, it would be great as an introduction to someone like my wife (a nurse).I wish I had read the reviews on this book before purchasing it, but I did get to look at the cool drawings in this one!"
4,I first saw the Young Rumblers at University of Delaware in,"1984 (roughly). They were remarkable. They were part of a Battle of the Bands show and they stood out from every other balls-in-front-band that night. Then less than a week later, I saw Tommy and Co tear up the State Theater for a Rocky Horror Picture Show anniversary. I think Tommy dragged a lot of girls kicking and screaming into puberty that night. The writing was always just fair but that didn't matter. The net effect was awesome, spellbinding.I don't know what happened. That band, so full of promise, so much piss'n'vinegar seems to have failed somehow. They were great, all that promise. What the heck happened?Tommy, if you're reading this...my suggestion to you is to issue a LIVE cd. Your strength was always in your performance so use that. Enough with the studio doctoring on your CDs. Get back to essence, man!"
4,Good Tunes,"I remember hearing ""I'm Not Your Man"" when I wan in college. It never got much attention, but that song stuck with me through the years. Recently I bought the CD, it's really good."
5,Gita,"This is not a book to speed read, but to savor bit by bit. I put it in my bathroom next to the toilet and read sometimes one page, sometimes two, and sometimes just a paragraph at a time. Many passages got a second or third reading before I moved on. Much of the cosmology parallel's that of the Bible. Moral lessons are the same, except for the references to reincarnation. Winding through life again and again until one is ready for the Eternal, however, is more palatable to me than living here just once and then descending to Hell or going to that murky place called Purgatory and finally on to Heaven. The translation is poetic and full of stark and amazing images."
5,Just What I'd Been Looking For,"I had been hoping to get a Gita that is clear and readily understandable, in the same way the Bible was finally translated into modern English. This translation is perfect to keep on the my nightstand. A friend has already asked to borrow it, so I may need to buy a new one!"
3,"ok, but needs lots of editing","both book 3 and 4 should have 100 pages ripped out of them. Much higher quality product then. And really very little would be lost.""explanation"" at end is a bit goofy, but ok. The war and the tower were pretty decent overall."
1,Mind-Numbing,"I thought the fourth installation in the Riverworld series would be exciting. At last, they are going to reach the tower and confront the unknown entities who have done this to humans! But first, unfortunately, Farmer drags on endlessly about the final gathering of the main characters and the battle between the two paddle wheelers, which drags ON and ON, chapter after chapter, describing each turn and blow ad nauseum. I couldn't even finish it. If my husband would let me, I would donate these books to Goodwill."
5,The journey concludes in a climatic style...,"This is the best of the series. PJF finally gets to pull all of his story lines together and have them meet at Virolando before moving on to the Dark Tower. This stunning conclusion to 20 years of writing leaves the reader extremely satisfied, mostly. The downside is the author has to kill off many of our friends who have toiled all those years in the Quest, and he doesn't even describe their death scenes. Fortunately, PJF did publish the 5 chapters he excised from the great battle between the riverboats, in a limited printing of a novelette called Riverworld War. Obtaining this small book is an absolute must in fleshing the final details of that great battle."
4,More Bang for Bucks,"It is hard to beat this Westinghouse on features and picture per dollar. This one has all the inputs and display modes I wanted plus built-in HDTV @ 37"". I think the Westinghouse look better (smoother) than most in similar price range. Only cons are the audio out - needing to be at 100% only to get a week output to the stereo. The digital SPDIF out seems to be better than the analog channels, but still a little weird. Overall this model is a nice improvement over the previous line and worth the upgrade."
2,Defective,"Apparently they're a very hit or miss company. The TV got here, we set it up, and then discovered that half the screen was non-functional. Called tech support and, what a surprise, it's a pre-order issue! Then we got the runaround from the company we bought it from. Generally a terrible experience, and unless I'm convinced otherwise, I'm not purchasing from Westinghouse or TigerDirect.com again."
1,Worst Seller I Have Ever Encountered,I purchased this LCDTV for my mother. Warren's World shipped a defective product to her. We return the TV to the seller at our cost when defect was dicovered. It has been almost a year later and I have not been refunded. I contacted Amazon at least 3 times concerning this issue with no success. They have not followed up and seem to be protecting this deadbeat partner of theirs. Between my wife and I we spend on average $8000 to $10000 per year at Amazon. I think we are done buying from Amazon.
3,"Well, at Least the Kids Liked It","This is most definitely a movie for the kids. Sure, I enjoy a good cartoon/animation, but this hardly fit the bill. The story was simple, the ending was predictable, the humor wasn't that fantastic (but kid friendly, I appreciate that), and I never really understood why anybody would consider Ashton Kutcher's selfish character could become somebody's friend.But, the kids enjoyed it and can't wait for it to hit DVD. So, adults should avoid this movie unless they are bringing the little ones to the theater."
4,CUTE MOVIE,THIS MOVIE WAS JUST ADORABLE AND I'VE SEEN IT ON REGULAR NOT 3D SO MY SON AND MY GRANDSON JUST LOVED IT
4,Better in 3-D,I loved this movie in 2d! But in 3-D it is much better!Great movie in either format. Pop in the player get some popcornsit back and enjoy.
5,The 3D is Exceptional!,"Well, there isn't much original that can be said after 3 dozen reviews,but, yes, to confirm what Keith Niemeyer and others have said, the3D in this is relentless and at times breathtaking. It will be the firstthing I show friends who wonder ""if this whole 3D thing is really worth it.""The story, in my opinion, varies between fair and good...but the picture is pure eye candy, and is fun just to marvel at.Yep, this one goes in your collection."
5,Open Season,Have not looked at this - i purchase movies for our country club going to use this during the holidays
3,"Excellent 3D Movie, Slow-moving plot, Writting not that Good....","This movie was a little hard for me to watch all the way thru b/c it was just sooo boring!!! and Ashton Kutcher's voice was sooo annoying!!!! But, the ending kind made up for it, esp when they were fighting back.... and even though he was the villian in the movie, that Hunter was hilarious!!!Having said that, I do have to agree, the 3D aspects in this movie was just awesome!!! If you are looking for a movie just based on 3Dness, this is a definate purchase....."
5,Hilarious,"I loved this movie for several reasons: it is funny, it is so apt in the depictions of the hunted and the hunted, and it treats a serious subject with humor. The animal characteristics are reminescent of Walt Disney and his magical touch with portrayals of animals. I recommend this movie for anyone who wants to laugh."
5,Hilarious!!,One of *my* favorite animated movies. A bear who doesn't know he's an animal!!! Lots of laughs!
4,great movie,"not only is this movie funny and well written, it also looks and sounds great in high definition the annimation is well done and very crisp."
3,great gift,This dvd was given as a gift. The child that received it said he liked it very much.Age 8
5,Great 3D,So few real 3D movies for our new tv and some are not so good but this was excellent. Great animated film and 3D. Would buy it again.
4,Good 3D,Bought this for my kids but I enjoyed it as well.Great family movie with some really good 3D effects. Worth adding to your collection.
3,Cute movie for all ages.,"I confess that it's hard for me to sit and watch a full feature movie at home. There's so much other things, folding laudry, dusting, that command my attention. HOWEVER, I actually sat down and watched this from beginning to end. It held my attention and I actually laughed out loud more than a few times! It was purchased for my 10 year old, but my 20 year old son ended up watching it and thought it was good too - and he rarely likes movies, especially animated ones! Now my 60+ mom wants to see it. This one is well worth the price and did I mention I almost had tears in my eyes at the end????"
3,It was Okay,"It certainly wasn't the best animated film out there. My kids(10,9,& 3) liked it. I have to say it is a kids movie and not really geared for parents and kids. Shrek did a much better job keeping parents entertained."
3,"One Fur All, and All Fur One","Can't help but evoke a comparison to Yogi as he associates with a Forest Ranger and has a penchant for people food. Overall a funny animated movie, but not a blockbuster like ""Finding Nemo"". However, certainly worth a rental. If you enjoy animated movies like ""Madgascar"", you may find it worth purchasing. Family friendly with about the worse being the stag putting the bears backpack with cookies in front of his crotch, thus making the bear refuse to eat them. The whole forest pretty much get's into this one when a rangers pet bear, ""Boog"", finds himself in the forest with no buddies. In a short amount of time he has everyone allied and assaulting the hunters as hunting season opens. Remember, ""the odd will get even"". The DVD quality is good and contains a few extras."
2,"Good buddy movie, but unfortunately...","It's a shame, really.The animation and voice work are quite good.The parts of the plot about Boog and Eliot's friendship are both funny and touching.Unfortunately, the storyline is badly marred by typically dishonest stereotypes of hunters.If you are a anti-hunting zealot and want to indoctrinate your children, than this is the movie for you.Rational thinking people should be prepared to explain the dishonest propaganda to their children, or skip the movie altogether."
3,Open Season 3D,"I might hold off on this one. I bought It cause I read these review's on here. But then I found out that this Is one of the first blu-ray 3D's. So that's why people were raving about It. Now after seeing Avavtar, Alice In Wonderland and Legend of the Guardians, this one Is'nt as good. Some of the 3D Is good though and It's watchable for that reason. Beware of the new Jackass. Not In Blu-ray 3D."
2,open season 3D,"I recently purchased a 3D TV and bought this based on the rave reviews. I should have looked at the 3 star reviews first. As someone else wrote, these reviews were written when 3D first became available and since then 3D quality has improved tremendously. Just reviewing it as a movie, it is very boring."
3,Good 3D graphics but poor movie,This movie possesses good 3D graphics but the movie itself is very weak. Kids may enjoy it but the 3D experience made this movie so much better to watch.
5,Great,"This is a great kids movie but I think adults would enjoy watching it with their childrens, highly recommend it."
3,Another ho hum kid's movie,"Open Season is another in the long line of recent ho-hum animated kid's movies. It is perfectly entertaining, the animation is good, the story is simple. You've seen the story before (or at least it feels like it): Nature versus Man, Personal Growth, the Sensible main character thrown for a twist who picks up a Colorful Sidekick. There are some very good scenes and some quite funny moments, then there are long slow parts. The surprise is Ashton Kutcher's voice work for a Elliot the wacky sidekick which was pretty good. Martin Lawrence displayed gentle insousance as Boog the Bear, however, I couldn't help but long for Eddie Murphy's madness. Overall a pleasant diversion but that's about it."
3,"Mediocre, harmless fer' the kiddies...","Undistinguished kiddie fare works just fine as babysitting material, but cartoony art direction and mediocre voice work does the film no favors for those over 12, who will find an unoriginal and not very compelling cartoon buddy flick.For those who are complaining that this cartoon is anti-hunting, please get a life! Since the film is called ""Open Season"", and the protagonists are animals, what exactly were you expecting? I guess we gotta start burning our copies of ""Bambi"" and ""Yogi Bear"", for fear that kiddies will get the wrong idea and mistake hunting for killing animals. These thin-skinned, humorless individuals probably have no problem with ethnic stereotypes portrayed as villains, animal stereotypes portrayed as relentless killing machines, etc. I eat tons of meat and have no problem with that aspect of the film. I wish these zealots would go away...!"
3,open season is okay!,"The movie itself was good. All the characters and voices were good, except for the main character by Martin Lawerance he doesn't bring any characteristic to it and doesn't make it unique like the others do so well. But the Blu-Ray dvd is wondeful, the quality is very sharp and great to see and the sound is wonderful, full use of the blu-ray system.."
2,"More annoying, talking animals.....Anyone?????","Oh come on, give us a break... ""The wild"", ""Madagascar"", ""Chicken little"", ""Barnyard""...and now ""Open season"". The only thing all these movies got is annoying, talking animals and same old stale humour, which audiences are sick of watching over and over again. No wonder all these movies bombed.Its time for the animation studios to come up with something new and original, rather than torturing the audiences with same old concepts and stale gags. Its high time."
1,Lousy,"You have to like Ashton K to watch a film he's in. Therefore, I cannot see this film. Go away Ashton go faaaaar away. France probably. Besides Ashton, it looked really bad in reviews anyway. Buy Over the Hedge instead."
1,Another unplayable Sony film.,"It started with the Pursuit of Happiness: a brand-new movie that was unplayable on the Harman Kardon DVD 25. In reviewing the Amazon online reviews, I was not the only one whom had the problem.Wife went to Blockbuster (who was about tO deny our request for a movie exchange) and rented Open Season - another Sony film. No dice.Too bad: like Pursuit of Happiness, I heard Open Season was a good film. I can gaurantee this - my next DVD player and/or next generation player won't be Sony.I stand corrected: I bought a Sony PS3 for Blu-Ray capability. So I guess my gaurantee wasn't worth much. Damm you Toshiba!!!!! :)"
4,Regarding 3D.....,"I will not provide a review of the movie as there are plenty of movie critics out there. I will however, concentrate on the in-home 3D aspect of this movie, and found this one of the best animated 3D movies currently out at the moment. Excellent depth perception, no ghosting of the images, and some good ""out of the screen"" scenes."
5,Wow it looks good,"I've had my Xbox HD-DVD player for 6 months and love it - hooked on HD movies. I was frustrated at not being able to get all the High Def movies available so I broke down and got the 100 dollar discounted PS3 as soon as the price break hit. For my first Blu-ray movie I selected Open Season, hoping I had made a good choice and felt comforted by the quality reviews I read on here (Amazon).Sure enough the reviews were true the picture is amazing in 1080P High Def. The movie was more entertaining than I expected. With the quality of the picture and the decent animation story you certainly won't regret your purchase. I wasn't blown away by the uncompressed audio, but it also didn't disappoint - just didn't really stand out where as the picture certainly did.I dunno if it's because this is an animated movie, but I can say that this is the best quality High Def content I've seen to date, better picture than the HD-DVD movies I've seen."
4,oh so funny!!!!!!,"My children and I enjoyed watching this movie together. We laughed so hard, especially at the deer. This is a great movie."
4,A great movie for the Family,"We have kids ranging in age from 9 to 2 and this movie kept us all entertained. There is something for everyone in this movie, even the adults were laughing through most of the movie. We always can tell if it is a good movie at our house by how often the kids pick it as the movie we should all watch and Open Season is picked as a top choice all the time."
3,Cute And Entertaining,"I really enjoyed this movie and the animation was great. However, Martin Lawrence didn't give 'Boog' enough personality. It was like I was watching Martin just being Martin. No spark or anything, quite dull. On the other hand, Ashton Kutcher was great as 'Elliot.' The beavers were cute with their big round black noses. Good film."
2,Not Very Good,"Well... it just felt like it tried to hard... the scenes that were meant to be heart-rending/funny/etc. just seemed way too pedantic; same with the animation. It's like ... okay here is the anticipation in the opposite direction he's going to move, and now he's moving! It's like... it should be transparent... just a general sense of good movement / storytelling.To me - it is a bad movie if I would rather be being bored than watching the movie... I got about 30 minutes in and then sort of skipped through the rest to see if it remarkably improved... which it didn't ... at all. If you're getting something for your kids; I will not get this - because it will make them stupider by watching it. They will fail at life; and then instead of your kid taking care of you in your old age you die sad and lonely in a gutter because G.W. Bush already spent your social security, sorry."
2,not what i expected,this was not what i expected. none of the pictures in this description pertain to this 3d. there is only 1 dog and no second bear. it is not about what the little video is about. the dogs do not take the rv.this has none of the scenes so if you are ordering it for what is shown do not. also on back of the cover it has special extras which there are none of. i will not return this though because its still a good 3d but just beware if you think you are getting one thing you will not get what you think. i do not know if they made 2 of this but would like the one i thought i was getting but i would be leery of ordering the second one as i may get this same one a second time
4,Hunter's nightmare,"A fairly good movie that my Grandkids thought was pretty funny. They loved the bear that was always getting into trouble. The animation is great. The movie wanders around a little bit, which makes it hard to follow sometimes. The underdogs get revenge when the animals take back the woods from the hunters. Overall , the kids, age 8 and 4, liked this movie."
4,Open Season - fun for the whole family,My grandchildren really enjoyed it. They loved all the Open Season movies and watch them over and over.It was great for the whole family.
5,Love this movie,Alot of creative details and laughter. You can relate to all the characters in the movie. It is fun for kids.
4,Witty!,"Great production values and pretty good fun for what it is, notwithstanding the stereotypical aspects of some of the character portrayals and the eco-politically-correct theme."
5,BEST LAUGHS IN YEARS,"From the moment youi first meet boog, till the end of this movie you will be laughing till the end, poor ole boog has it made until he befriends a one antler deer named elliot, no one especialy boog could ever dream of the trouble a sweet little deer could cause until he takes him to his home in the garrage where he lives,soon after the chance meeting of these two wildlife animals boogs lifestyle of a bed, snacks and espicaly a toilet are transformed to the good old backwoods, where he is teased and tormented by the wild animals until open season comes in, then things change and everyone starts to look up to boog to save them, this is a non stop laughing comady that couldnt have been done right without the help of martin lawrence who plays boog, this is a must see..."
4,Another mighty WILDHEARTS release,It's hard to keep up with music that is coming out here in the States. Mostly due to the fact that the best material is from overseas and ends up being an import at a higher price here. The Wildhearts CDs are worth whatever you pay. This new one features Ginger and the boys really rocking out with some longer songs(great guitar work)and very current and hard hitting topics. It is a shame that more great overseas bands aren't more popular in the States but it just shows how lame the music industry is and why they are going broke.
1,Worst item I've ever bought,This has to be the worst game i have ever bought. Its not even really a game .It basically turns your gameboy into a computer and there are a few games on(like rock paper scissors and a pac man type thing) it but nothing terribly fun. I am really disappointed with it. You think it would be cool with a title like this... Dont buy it!
4,Very nice product,I'm impressed with the quality of this album. I would buy it again and give it as gifts.
1,Host Your Own Murder Partiers - beware!,"This book was suggested in the Host's Guide for the Host Your Own Murder Party ""The Watersdown Affair"". It said that you could get some meal ideas from it. The recipe section in this book is very small and not worth buying the book for. For a good dessert for this party, make a Trifle. The recipe I used was ""John Clancy's English Trifle"" from ""The Heart of Christmas"" book by Victoria Magazine. Wow, was it yummy!"
5,Couldn't put this book down,"This is a must read fellow romance fans. The book is seperated into three parts, each one dealing with the budding romance of the three sisters. I will not give away the story, but believe me I have never enjoyed a story more."
5,Enjoyable.,"""Laughter on the 23rd Floor"" is a very funny play, with its dramatic points strewn along. The dialogue is extremely funny and witty, but the language at times can be profane. I can see Simon's ""Brighton Beach Memoirs"" in there a bit, and he doesn't stray too far from a writer's life and dream. A nice play - I recommend."
4,Funny but probably too American,"I feel that Laughter on the 23rd Floor is funny but the jokes are probably too American. One of the biggest flaws of the play is that the characters are stereotyped. They lack depth and therefore, the audience don't really feel for or associate with them."
4,Dreamy fun and witty contempt,"I first discovered Laurie Colwin within the pages of Gourmet magazine about 15 years ago. With pleasure, I awaited each issue to see if another of her wonderful columns would appear. Then, in 1992 came the sad announcement of her untimely death at age 48. It was then that I discovered she wasn't only a food writer of incomparable wit and wisdom; she was also a novelist. So I began reading everything she'd written. My favorites are A Big Storm Knocked It Over and this one, Goodbye Without Leaving.Geraldine Coleshares gives up grad school at the Univ of Chicago to become the only white backup singer for a R&B group, the Shakettes. Her days with the band, life on the bus and on the road, make everything that comes after (marriage, kids, a job) pale by comparison. Told mostly in retrospect, Geraldine's story is a never-boring exploration of such potential clichés as family, friendship, career, parenthood, and love.Terrific. Read it, and then read her other ones."
5,One of Colwin's best,"I've read and reread all of Colwin's books and this is the one I've come to identify with and like the most. All of Colwin's wit, humanity, and inventiveness is here in a quirky but believable story about a young woman whose experience as a backup singer comes back to haunt her the rest of her life."
2,Disappointing (from an otherwise Laurie Colwin fan),"Strange to say, I did not like this novel nearly as much as her earlier work. I usually find her narrative voice and her attention to detail charming and engaging, but here it bogged down and just became tedious. There are no fully-drawn characters, only types, including the heroine (or should I say ""hairoyne"" -- from a motif in the novel) herself. And, while I found the dilemmas of her earlier characters regarding marriage and identity quite moving, especially in ""Another Marvelous Thing"" and ""Family Happiness,"" I found Geraldine's crises to border on the selfish and self-absorbed. Who knows what might have followed this swan song? For all of that, I do love Colwin, and I still cook from her cookbooks."
1,I guess I don't get the Colwin cult,"I must be one of the few people who don't get Laurie Colwin. Her food commentary leaves me indifferent, I'm not crazy about her receipes and her novels all seem to be the same semi-adolescent whine. This was her last novel, and the same themes are repeated. A sense of drift, searching for identity, and painfull mother bashing. I read this in the hopes that she really was going to grow up at some point. I was wrong. Her whole career seemed to be built on searching for a ""grown up"" identity that never came."
2,Disappointing,"The Rock Group episodes were intriguing and quirky. Held my interest. But once the protagonist conceives and goes through the pregnancy and motherhood cycle the book becomes a mish mash of hackneyed cliches.Colwin specializes in off the wall women trying to find themselves. They are always at war with their mothers. Never find any redeeming features in either of their parents. This is pretty tired and unoriginal stuff in my view.Her short stories/novella, "" Another Marvelous Thing "" does it a bit better. But, I think that a writer has to grow beyond their immature obsessions."
4,Raises Important Isues that must be addressed by formal Diversity Programs,"As the author of my own diversity blog: [...] I was all set to lambast this book when I recently purchased a used copy from Amazon. Although, the book did not fail to anger me in a few places, it does raise several viewpoints and questions about human nature and the efficacy of diversity programs in light of who we are. Additionally, it paints a view of the future under some accepted diversity tenets that may not correspond with the intentions of diversity's proponents. Good reading for serious and not-so-serious discussions."
2,Thumbstick pads fall off!,"This product is not designed to last. If you play a lot of FPS games like I do, there's a lot of joystick work to be done. The buttons work fine, trigger sensitivity is all good. The digital d-pad is a little finicky though. It takes a lot of practice to hit only ONE direction.This controller has silicone pads on its joysticks that grip really well to your skin. However, they do NOT grip well to the plastic underneath that they are bonded to. After a while, the silicone pads start to tear open at the seam, eventually just falling off. What you get then is a rather unusable hard plastic core of the thumbstick.You're better off spending some money on a legit Microsoft 360 controller that's built with solid construction and will be guaranteed to last."
2,Bad D-Pad,"On the whole this controller is ok, but the D-Pad is very unresponsive and can take multiple presses to work. I wouldn't recommend this controller because of this. That said, it's fine for most games I've played and the only occasion that it would really infuriate me would be playing something like Tetris. But for hardcore gamers, I could see it being a serious problem in an intense multiplayer game. Also the RB and LB buttons are clicky and loud. They work fine, but they don't feel or sound very good. The vibration is a bit more muted than on a Microsoft controller too.Microsoft controllers can be had used/new for about the same money now and that's what I'd do if I were to do it over again."
2,Kodak Premium Photo Paper-Glossy...I'm disappointed in you,"I recently purchased this paper, in bulk mind you, and found myself to be very disappointed in my purchase. I love to take digital pictures and print them myself and frame them to give as gifts. Well, I bought this brand thinking it was better...but it really took forever for the ink to dry...if I waited for an hour...when I'd place it in the frame, it would look like the picture was wet against the glass. I let the picture dry out for a complete day before I could even frame it...and I think part of that to blame is the thickness of the paper. I guess I'll go back to Epson photo paper, since that one seems to work better for me."
3,Improper sizing,"I live on the Arizona desert, an ideal test site for evaporative vests. This vest does a wonderful job of keeping me cooler while riding my motorcycle. The reason I am not giving five stars on the review is that the vest is incredibly SMALL. I ordered one size larger than I normally wear and the vest is much too small on me. People should not have to guess about what size to order. The company should have them sized according to normal sizing standards."
2,Evaporative Vest,"I have MS so do not tolerate the heat very well and purchased this item in hopes of being able to be at my son's baseball games, ride my bike, spend a little more time outside, etc on nice warm days. I tried the vest one time. You have to soak the vest and wring it out before wearing. I did this and wore it all day on a day when it was in the 80's. It was humid out so this may have made it not work as well. All it did for me was totally soak my shirt I had on underneath and make me feel more sticky/hot from the humidity. Summer is pretty much over so I doubt I will try it again this year. I do not recommend it for others with MS looking to get out more on nice summer days."
2,Good when it works,"I've used two of these vests. The first was completely defective in that it wouldn't absorb water. The polymer gel once it got wet literally leaked out of the vest. The second one lasted about six weeks. In the end, the gel in it too wouldn't hold moisture. When it did work, it was great. I used it for bicycle riding in 100+ degree heat. It made the difference in feeling the heat. The drawback is that it's heavy when it's wet. Your shirt definitely gets wet too. When it loses it's evaporative ability after a couple of hours, it is still heavy and because it doesn't breath, you start to overheat. If you can keep it wet, then you're good, but if you don't have access to a ready water supply, you're out of luck. The big thing is that it's sort of pricey for it's short life span."
1,not very practical,I threw it away after the second day of riding my Harley on a long trip in the summer. It is too impractical to keep re-soaking it while riding a motorcycle. This product could be useful for construction work if two were used so one could be soaking in the back of a pickup while the other was being worn.
4,Not true to size,"The vest is fantastic! However, it is not sized right. The vest is not true to size. If you are a size large order an XL and so on."
3,cooling vest product,"Works somewhat well to keep one cool while riding a motorcycle, but a bit clammy when first put on and then dries out rather quickly."
1,Blew out first 3 months,This product blew out on me the first 3 months. I contacted startech to get a replacement but I just ended up going with another product. I used at as an extra monitor for market charts but the quality and lag turned me off. There are better products around the same price range.
1,look elsewhere,"I purchased one of these to use with a 3rd monitor for my work PC. I'm using display port adapter for 1, VGA for 2, and (was using) this USB adapter for monitor 3. I downloaded the latest drivers for Windows 7 from startech and still have nothing but problems trying to run this on my Dell 20"" monitor. The refresh is terrible, and I get a lot of horizontal lines when running at 60hz and 32bit color. I also had a lot of issues when coming back from locking my workstation. The adapter would need to be unplugged/replugged in order to recognize the 3rd monitor again.And to top it off, the support is even worse than the product. Sending it back."
5,Insightful Truth,"In choosing to respond appropriately to suffering you ensure that the experience leads to something beneficial. Free will is involved in that decision. Dr. Schuller writes, ""I promise you that there is gain in every pain."" Our reaction to pain is crucial! That choice determines whether we will expeience the benefits associated with the suffering process.Hurts do not endure permanently. Pain passes. Trials end. He tells us to view pain as a process not an event. God has a purpose for everything. People who have made significant marks are the ones who have responded successfully to adversity. Thank God Dr. Schuller is in that group and left this work and others showing us that we too can make our way through life's challenges."
5,Travelin' time,"On a recent trip to Texas, I had the opportunity to meet & hearHolland at a blues club in Ft. Worth. I was impressed by hisenergy and ability to keep the crowd movin'. He is one man Iwant to hear again. His music has become my traveling soundfor many future trips this summer. His combination of blues,swing & rockabilly are remarkable. Looking forward to hearingthe new CD for release soon."
4,Cats and Crime,"There are lots of cats and crime novels out there...crime solving cats are almost a cliche. But in Dymmoch's first mystery novel, cats are metaphors for human behavior: independent, intelligent, and irrepressible. Dymmoch writes about them well...in fact, Dymmoch is an excellent writer in general. ""The Man Who Understood Cats"" is well written, and fairly well constructed, though I felt it a bit repetitive: the sequence of murders seemed similarly devised (suicides made to look like murders) and the ultimate discovery of the murder was an anticlimax: he was the least developed of characters and his motives remain unclear.However, I enjoyed the setting and the partnership of cop and shrink, and I am looking forward to reading the next book in this series."
1,Professional School Owner Here...,"We recently purchased this because I am a Karate nut and collect all kinds of items. I have been teaching Martial Arts since 1992 and although I understand the karate school people's point of view, I realize this is just a toy. My 5 year old daughter loves this item, but she does love classes more often. The only real problem I see with this is that it will become another thing you garage sale when the child gets bored with it. There are many ""open minded"" schools out in the USA and I suggest you talk with all the instructors if you are interested in enrolling your child. If they bash anything, then they are going against the true code of the arts which instills humility, compassion and integrity. I am not threatened by this ""toy"" and I purchased one for fun. Just my two cents worth :)"
1,Horrible Toy...,"I got this for my son for Christmas a few months ago...and within two weeks, it was ruined. The punching/kicking bag, will not keep air in it..and the DVD was so dorky! My son watched it 2 times and never again. He never plays with any of it. I would never buy this for anyone else..or any other products by this company. This is a crappy toy. Beware!"
1,NOT A TOY,"I agree with the reviews given to this ""toy"". I myself learned TAE KWON DO. Martial arts teaches discpline, respect for others and yourself. Having this kind of ""toy"" would instill in a child wrong sense of self esteem and might use it to harm others that is why self-defense is taught by actual instructors to guide and condition them MENTALLY AND PHYSICALLY."
4,"Pretty good, but I wish he'd give more details","I liked the book. Clegg covers both the concept of infinity and its companion, the concept of infinitesimal, from Greek days to the present, in a way I found very readable. I have very little to complain about except that I found it sometimes frustrating that his treatment oversimplified and didn't give enough details.(For example, he has a chapter on Abraham Robinson's nonstandard analysis. I think that, next to Cantor, Robinson's ideas are probably the most important on the subject of anyone who has worked in it, yet I felt I did not get an adequate picture of Robinson's ideas of infinity and infinitesimals from the chapter.)Still, it is the best book on the subject at a ""popular"" level I have seen."
4,Mind expanding,Get ready to have your mind blown away with thoughts and concepts of the endless that cannot be contained because infinity is bigger than even that!!
2,Eurocentric,"Unfortunately this book ignores the contributions of the ancient Indians. Infinity did not start with the Greeks. In fact, the Greeks had big troubles with infinity. The ancient Indians had much more fruitful investigations into infinity, especially the Jains before Aritstotle. After the ancient Greeks, the Indians continued to study infinity, including Aryabhata and the Kerala School."
1,Don't Waste Your Money!,"Sheesh, the fact that a 60-year-old Stuart Whitman was supposed to be a sex symbol to hot young babes in this loser of a movie was enough to put me off my dinner for a while! What a silly waste of my time! The plot was ridiculous (vengeful Robert Vaughn out to assassinate Castro) and the acting deplorable."
1,A Description,"From Back Cover:Glory Carson couldn't believe she'd actually agreed to sexy Texan Bram Bishop's unorthodox proposition. For two weeks she would ""act"" as Bram's wife so the determined wanna-be groom could learn the husband ropes and lasso himself a real bride. Glory herself had no intention of ever getting married. As a marriage counselor, she was only in this ruse for its research value - certainly not because she found the blue-eyed, blue-collar Bram husband material. And although she thought she'd coveyed this loud and clear, she never counted on Bram's love of a challenge!"
5,"Almost like being ""on wings of the songs""","I bought this album two weeks ago, but now it's one of my favorite albums. The song called ""on wings of the song"" made me almost like being ""on wings of the song"" and flying above the countries I've never been to.Ms. Bonney's voice is very clear and pure, she has the kind of voice we can't help loving. Of course, Geoffrey Persons the accompalist is also great. It's very sad that he have been dead for a few years.Especially, my favorite songs are ""on wings of the song"" and ""The longing for Spring,"" ""Ave Maria"" (This is the finest performance I've ever heard.) and ""The trout."" Of course, the others are very good. I hope Ms.Bonney will continue to record many wonderful lieder.Brava, Ms.Bonney!!!!!"
4,Sweet ...,Hearing Ms. Bonney singing the lieders is undescribeable... her sweet lyrical soprano voice bring along fantastic interpretation. I like the Gretchen Am Spinrade best! Like nothing I've heard before!
5,Beautiful melodies and enchanting voice,"I used to enjoy German lieders of Brams, Schubert and Mendelssohn very much. This album is a wonderful collection of master pieces. And Barbara did an excellent job."
4,VERY VERY Sour,Bought those rememebring my fave candy from back home. They are good but a tad too sour for what I expecting.. just the tiny difference in between sour fun and just sour sour.. :)like you kinda of hurt when eating it rather than just have the tingling sensation
2,ugg.....,"this is the last v.c. andrews book i will ever read. i read the dollanganger, casteel, and dawn series and it just had to end right here. i can't take anymore of this trashiness. ruby was a decent gal in the first of the series but in this book, she is so stupid and naive. what a waste"
5,I couldn't put it down!,"This particular book made me upset and mad. I couldn't put it down, I always kept on reading to see if Daphne would ever change. But unfortunatly she didn't. I love this series because it is great for young adults and captures their attention, encourages them to read more to find out what is going to happen. I'm a 15 year old girl and love this series. It really makes you think and wonder if that was you in that predicament. I would think all day of the book and couldn't wait to read more. Loved It!!!"
5,This book inspired me to read all the other VCA novels,This is the VC Andrews book I read ever and at the time I didn't even know the woman or that she was dead. This was a very good book taking place in New Orleans during the early to mid 60s. The characters are unforgettable and adults can get into the VC Andrews earlier books as oppose to the later teeny bopper ones that just have her name on the book. Good for Ruby for having to put up with sister Giselle and stepmom Daphne after the father is dead. Kind of reminds you of Cinderella but with a sick twist. Ruby also runs away back to her hometown to have her baby and part of that has to do with the title of the book. That was wimpy of Beau to run off after Ruby gets pregnant by him but he makes up for it in the later books. The ghostwriter did a very good job with this novel with the help of VC Andrews touch.
1,Shady Genre That Keeps Selling Though Andrews Died In 80s,"This is a sleazy series, ghostwritten (obviously, since Andrews died sometime during the 1980s), that recycles all the traumatic events in her early books into a new package with yet another sweet but hapless little girl on the cover. The writing is bad, the characters are thinly drawn, and the story is just a bastardized version of the real Andrews' novels. I thought the market for the ""girl who is partially orphaned, then betrayed by adoptive parents, then falls in forbidden incestuous love with some relative, and then is raped by some other relative""-story was called the porn industry. I can't believe this is actually becoming like a genre unto itself. How totally shady!"
2,Question in the mist...or is it the fog?,"Do they honestly expect us to believe that Gisselle would just magically overcome her paralysis? That is THE stupidest thing I've ever heard. Even if she COULD overcome it, it would take therapy and exercise, not just farting around in her room and lifting herself out of her wheelchair. Anyone else notice this?"
2,I really didn't care for this.,"I really didn't care for this. It was really just full of teenage angst & it didn't end. I'm an adult. Why do I want to re-live those days of high school? I read the 1st in this series & liked it. So, I read this one. I'm glad this didn't stop me from reading the next in the series ""All That Glitters."" It was very good!"
5,v.c pearl in the mist,"I had it, loan it to a friend and never got it back. Was so thrilled that i could find it and buy it here on amazon and best of all is that i found the cover that i originally had. They were shipped quickly and arrived in perfect condition. Thank you."
2,What a sick author,This author always has to have some sick twist of incest in every book she writes! The books come out good but the incest gotta go.
3,"Can help you, talking to your child about soiling problems","We have read through this book and find that it can be useful as an aid to opening discussions with your child about encopresis. Having said that, we feel that it is aimed at a very low age group, who may have difficulties with reading in the first instance. The one problem we have is that our encopretic children are above the elementary reading level and therefore got bored and distracted very easily.One situation that arises with encopresis is that children tend to feel very alone and afraid, because of the amount of pressure heaped on to them at an important stage in their development. This book goes some way to addressing those feelings, but if you are considering it for a child over 5-6 years of age (which is of course the very age where encopresis is causing its biggest headaches) then maybe have the book on a side stand somewhere, and try to talk to your child on a more personal level."
