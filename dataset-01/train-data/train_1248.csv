2,"Awesomeee, until a week later","I got these sunglasses in almost perfect condition (a little scratched) but in good shape, they were perfect, everyone was jealous and they were dark enough for my liking but about 5 days after I got them, I woke up to get them but they had weird black dots on the lens on the other side of the lens, they were clear so it wasnt a sharpie or anything. I was really disappointed. I asked my parents and they said the mirror lenses dissolved in my sweat or something O.o the nosepiece also fell off. They are really cheap and I would reccomend buying some for a little higher price at an actual store."
3,SHOCKED!!,"I bought this sunglasses about a week ago and they came as expected. When i got home from college i checked my mailbox and found a white parcel and my face lite up with happiness. I rushed into and opened it and guess what i found... quality sunglasses. Here is the downside to this aviator: 1. the hinges are stiff, its almost like the glasses died and got rigor mortis. 2. the frame is HUGE! Other than that it is awesome for the price of $3, oh the reflection is great."
5,amazing product,"Amazing product and even better delivery timing, ordered friday afternoon, got the package in mondays mail"
4,"Great aviator sunglasses, not for people with small faces!",I have seen various sizes of fake aviators so even though my face is smaller for a guy I thought I would give these a try since they were so cheap. I will probably be giving them to a friend because they are just too large for my face. I would definitely only recommend these sunglasses for people with a medium-large face. Overall they seem to be good quality and worth the price.
2,cheap,these look nice but are of poor quality. Very small fit. I am rough on my glasses so these lasted about a month
1,way too dark,"I was looking for some old school mirrored sunglasses and they are that. Heck, I think you could weld in these as they are that dark. I can not see anything unless I was in a severely bright sun."
4,Good for what I wanted,"See, I wanted a pair of glasses that can simultaneously raise my cool factor and douche factor. This pair of glasses did the trick and now I'm a cool douche. I have a hot new girlfriend and my grades dropped. Would recommend."
3,You get what you pay for,"These sunglasses are bad. However, you're paying 2 or 3 dollars for them. Mine scratched immediately over stupid stuff...lenses are very bad. And after about two weeks just broke when I was wearing them. The reason I give it a three is because I might buy like 10 of them and be able to have them for 6 months for 30$ when if I bought a nice pair of Ray Bans or something, I might lose them! So it could be a good depending on how you treat your nice pair of designer sunglasses. They look nice, but die quick. Hope this helps!"
4,Perfect final touch to Police Costume,"I thought I was going over the top purchasing these for my 5 yr old's police costume (I got him a donut too, evil grin). My son LOVED the glasses. My only concern is durability; however, these will do . . . I did buy them for a 5 yr old after all . . . there aren't glasses made that are durable for a 5 yr old. He has a tour at a police station coming up . . . he cannot wait to wear them on the tour!"
3,Overall a good buy,"The sunglasses are pretty good. You can tell that they are knock offs, but are still very stylish without paying upwards of $80"
1,you get what you pay for,very cheap but I shouldn't have been suprised based on price - took a chance and big failure. Would not recommend.
2,Flimsy,I found this product to be too flimsy and cheaply made. I can't even see through the lenses properly because they are a bit fuzzy.
2,Lens issue,I loved these glasses until I was wearing them and the lens popped out. I tried and tried to pop it back in but it didn't work. All in all they are good glasses but you really have to be more than careful with them.
3,Bummed,"Got the aviators. This is one of those you get what you pay for. One pair the nose piece came off, and the other pair the lense popped out. Buy cheap, get cheap. They were cute while they lasted."
5,Great!,"Great product for such a cheap price!One lens did pop out, but I was able to put it back in without a problem."
1,Do NOT buy these,"If I could select a ZERO star, I would. These sunglasses went straight from the packaging box to the garbage bin. I would not give these away, much less sell them. Do not waste your $1 or $2, not worth it."
3,Get what you paid for,"I was excited to open and receive my shades, but more disappointed to find that the were cracked. I Don't blame Amazon i blame the packaging. it was filled with the air plastic but it does no good if its not on the side of the lens in Witch mine was face down.I assume that caused the the crack. you get what you paid for a 50/50 chance of intact shades."
3,Not that reflective,"These sunglasses are not nearly as reflective as the product image would lead you to believe. However, for the price, they aren't that bad."
1,Really BAD,Hi guysbought these a few days back from amazon. Highy pathetic and already broken with scratches.I dont recommend them even if u get them for 1$.
1,Meh.. Not so hot - Spend $5 more and get a better pair,"Broke 1st day. Lense came out. Also, The lenses are shaped a little strange to me. They are kind of elongated, that just look a littel strange compaired to all the other pairs of aviators ive had. I ordered a good pair but they would not make it in time for me to go on vacation. Im leaving today and my good pair comes in tomorrow. For the price i figured these could hold me over for the week im gone. Well, The lense popped out and the center bridge has come apart after 2 days. I know they are $5 but was hoping for atleast a week. They are not very reflective and not very dark. Even if they had not broke, I dont how good they would of been."
3,Sunglasses,"Looking for cheap shades? These are for you, obviously cheap, they are not durable whatsoever but they get the job done"
1,You get what you pay for,"Found this ""deal"" onlineThe glasses have a defect in the cheap lenses, and I feel the frame bending when I tried to put them on.I'd give these away for free, but I don't think anyone would take them."
4,Good considering the price,got these for my 5 year old son to go with a pilot uniform. They are big on him but serve the purpose. Silver frame and mirrored lenses as described.
3,Glasses,The glasses were received slightly bent however that has nothing to do with the rating they seem fairly cheap but then again there a cheap price good for wat you pay definetly worth it but nothing special.
2,"Look nice, but fall apart quickly","When I got these I liked the way they looked, so I bought a couple more pairs to save for later. Within 3 months every pair had broken or fallen apart in some way. Save your time and buy a different brand from somewhere else"
4,Too small for man,I bought these glasses for my husband and he didn't liked them because there too small there more like for woman but they are very pretty
1,spots all over the lens,There are visible marks and scratches all over the lens that won't come off. Should have expected it for only paying $5
3,"Cheap, you get what you pay for",These shades are ok because they were so cheap but they bend extremely easy. The only really good part is that they mirror everything so it's like night when you put them on hahah
1,Cheap,Very cheaply made. They broke the first time I wore them. If you are a person that is very easy on sunglasses and treats them delicately they might work fine but they were not for me.
2,"cheap, flimsy and non-durable","The sunglasses I received are very cheap, flimsy and non-durable - my local convenience store carries higher quality sunglasses. This will be my last shopping experience here. The sunglasses also fit very odd - they cover more of your forehead than they do your eyes. This makes these sunglasses uncomfortable, and it is an odd appearance when worn."
1,Low Quality,These broke within a week. One of the eye sockets just popped out and the frame was snapped in half. Spring for a more expensive pair.
5,Money well spent,"I was iffy about buying these shades after watching the video review posted. I decided to take a chance anyway for the price can't be beat. I got them today and I couldn't be happier. Great quality, sturdy, dark, and truly mirrored. I'm ordering another one because I tend to scratch my shades."
3,Decent buy for the money,"I've been looking to find a good pair of aviators, unfortunately these were too large to fit my face.They look sleek at a distance but, up close it's easily noticeable that they aren't made of any quality material (plastic frame). You get what you pay for at $3 though. Can't really complain about the price so if they don't fit, it's easy enough to just give them away."
3,Fickle construction.,"My product arrived on time, the shipping was speedy. However, when I opened the package, one of the lenses had popped out of the frame! These were intended to be a gift for my boyfriend, who was waiting in the other room for his surprise. Embarrassed, I quickly tried to fix them. I managed to pop the lens right back into the frame, and presented them to him. He was so excited. :) He kept asking me how much I had paid for them, telling me that I didn't need to buy him such a nice gift. (Little does he know!) He showed them off to all of his friends, and wouldn't take them off the whole day. However, he texted me this morning, telling me that he accidentally dropped them at work, and the lenses scratched really easily. A little bit of a bummer. But overall, he couldn't tell that I had bought them so cheap, and he was impressed with the quality. I just wonder how long they can REALLY last."
2,Either came with no nose piece or fell off day 1,"Put these actually fairly nice looking shades on for the first time, 15 minutes later, noticed something was piercing my nose. Low and behold the nose piece was gone, and along with it the $3 I paid for them. Piece of crap, but hey, what did I expect. Derp!"
2,Aviators,"I love the look of these glasses, and the shipping was expedited BUT they were so scratched when I recieved them I cant even wear them :("
2,You get what you pay for,"I bought these for my boyfriend for his birthday. When they arrived I was shocked at how crappy they are. They are pretty much plastic...the cheapest plastic I've ever seen. I gave them to my boyfriend as a ""gag gift"" when honestly they were meant to be a real gift. I was very disappointed. Especially after all of the nice reviews. Unbelievable."
4,Nice and cheap,"Ordered these for around $4 or so. I never buy expensive sunglasses because I'm careless with them. I own several cheap pairs so that I can have one in each of my cars, a spare pair around the house etc... These sunglasses are pretty decently made for the price. They fit comfortably although if you have a small head, you may find them to be a bit loose. Besides that, they look good and provide good protection from the sun. Well worth the $4-$5."
1,horrible glasses,"I received my glasses on time but thats no surprise with the quality of the glasses. I would ship those out as fast as possible just to be rid of them too! I opened the package, put the glasses on my face and a couple walking steps later the lens fell right out. Lasted a whole 3 min (thats including the time it took to open package!) Worst purchase yet."
4,Sunglasses,"Very good quality! I've purchased other mirrored glasses before, but I must say they weren't as well made as these. They seem to be pretty sturdy."
3,bad fit. not for me.. but maybe for you,"buying sunglasses , especially aviator glasses online is tricky, you just dont know quite how they with form to your face. it didnt work out for me and looked better on men"
3,Decent Product : ),"It's a pretty sexy set of shades ; )I received mine, with a lens busted out, and had to mash it back into place. lol. It's a really dark lens, very hard to see out of if it's cloudy, apart from that, awesome."
1,"Guess if you pay cheap, you get cheap","These sunglasses were made very cheaply. When they arrived, the lens weren't even placed right in the lens holders. No time to review or contact seller concerning this as we were leaving the next day for Disney. So my son wore them anyway on the trip in hopes that the lens would not fall out of the frames. Well, he wasn't that lucky cause out it came. When he tried to put the lens back into frame the frame then broke! In the garbage can is where they went. Won't try and get off cheap next time! And I would advise everybody the same."
1,"Thanks, but NO.","I got these for my bridesmaids this past summer (June 2010) and they were great! They came with cloth cases and everything. They were just the right size and were great quality for an even better price. Since I lost my pair and have the tendency to lose sunglasses somewhat regularly, I recently decided to grab a new pair and two back-ups. (May 2011) BAD IDEA. The price was still low but it was no wonder. I got three cheap, crooked, not even good enough to be costume quality sunglasses and not surprisingly, no cloth bags. The next time I need a new pair, I will NOT be buying them from here. BUYER BEWARE!!!"
2,"Look Cool, But quality is S***!","These pair of sunglasses look very cool until you wear them in water and the tint starts to dissolve! And not to mention I snapped them in half with the force of a 6 month old. But you get what you pay for, after all, they're only a couple of bucks.haha"
1,Get what you pay for,"Actually these glasses are a piece of junk. You can get a better pair of cheap sunglasses at the Goodwill Store. As soon as I opened the plastic wrap and took the glasses out, the nose piece bent. You get what you pay for and if you want CHEAP CHEAP SUNGLASSES these are for you."
3,Broke just out of the box,"I agree the price is low and you get what you pay for. Still, didn't expect it to break so soon.One of the glasses popped right out of the frame just as I took it out of the box.I stuck it back and I continue to use it just when I drive. And I do not drive too far everyday.The entire thing seems to be made out of plastic. The mirror on the glass had some scratches."
3,Fit for it's price,"After reviewing extensively all of the reviews on here, I still chose to go through in buying the product. The product I bought was sold by Gravity Trading.In terms of delievery - everything went perfect, it came in 2 days. In term of product quality, I can say that it's worth the $4 I paid, but no more than that. The lenses themselves are of great quality, but they came with a scratch. The frame was what I had the biggest problem with - It was extremely flimsy, and I was afraid to bend in the earbars for the fear of it snapping. I haven't worn it outside in a while... There are better alternatives."
3,"Good glasses, but I accidentally broke them","I got these glasses because a similar pair was stolen from me on the subway in Boston... Anyway, they were great glasses for a fair price, but I accidentally knelt on them and bent them out of shape the first day I had them... I'd order them again if aviators actually looked good on my face"
3,"only for looks, very impractical...","These look great. I've gotten compliments wearing them for less than one week. However they are only good as fashion accessories.They are mostly useless in the sun for seeing. They are too dark under most conditions yet they do not reduce glare. They actually make it more difficult to see especially for things in the shadows or shades. I cannot keep these on indoors at all.When driving, I cannot pick out pedestrians or cyclists in the shades or under the shadows of trees. I also have difficulty reading my dashboard. I have trouble backing up with my tinted rear windshield which i have no trouble with other sunglasses.Basically I cannot wear them for everyday use. I will save these for bbq in the park, lying on the beach or napping by the pool, just looking cool... :p"
1,out of my thoughts,"i never thought this product will be like this ,i feel sorry for the money i paid on it ,the finish of the painting is bad and the lens was scratched,think several times before you try to buy it ,it was out of expecatations."
2,terrible customer service,"Not only was the sunglasses the opposite of what I ordered, but it was sent to the wrong address and it didnt even get to that address in time."
2,it broke easily,"Thought that these glasses were perfect for my trip...took a pair of glasses that looked good and thought it would survive throwing in and out of a beach bag. The glasses were not ruff n tuff, it broke easily."
1,THE WORST!!!!!,"USELESS,PLASTIC,TWISTED,DEFECTIVE,THE WORST QUALITY,SELL THESE GLASSES IS A LACK OF RESPECT TO THE CONSUMER....DO NOT BUY this crap, THE TRUTH IS THAT I SUGGEST TO AMAZON EXECUTIVE NOT SELL THIS CLASS OF ....CRAP!!"
1,piece of crap,this item is cheap i kno but wow i can't believe i bother wasting 3 bucks on this poop aviators i could got me 3 whopper juniors instead of this wow what a wast when i got these glasses i got it out of the cloth and bam there's a fatty scratch on one of the lenses off the bat wow u serious are u guys selling use junk and passing it as new u cheap son of a gun i'm never buying anything from this company u suck seriously selling broken and used products to people
1,piece of crap,i havent bought this item but it looks like ice cream with king kongs throw up in it. so do not buy item
1,Misshipped - UPS&Amazon did nothing,"We bought these for our wedding. We purchased 10 pairs and the were misdelivered by UPS. Amazon tried to track them down, but couldn't. Apparently, they will maybe get sent back and credited. After that, Amazon would not help send a replacement order. So after an hour and a half on the phone, I'm still without glasses and only got voicemail for H2K. Bottom line, when something goes wrong with Amazon, Amazon and UPS can do nothing..."
2,nice but not worth it,i looked to wear this so badly but it was such a mess to try and get it out out the cardboard tube which is bnot well protecting it. it arrived scratched but i was happy to see them refund my money.
4,Good For Driving,I purchased these glasses to feel just like Robert Patrick in T2.Now I have accomplished my goal. These glasses seem ok for the price. I only plan to use them for driving. They seem to really do a good job with handling the sun.
3,"Great product, lousy seller!!!!!!!","While the product is exactly as stated, the item was received several days AFTER the last stated day on the delivery range. Sending e-mails to the seller is useless, they never, ever, EVER respond. So while you may GET what ever it is you order, expect it to be pretty darn late, and done EVER expect a response from the seller."
2,"Cheap enough, but they fit poorly",You get what you pay for with these. UV protection is not 100%. They keep falling off of my face when I put them on.
3,too big...,"The glasses came earlier than scheduled, but once they arrived, I found out they were way too big! :("
2,AVIATOR SUNGLASSES,"These sunglasses are HUGE!!!! they fall off my face as soon as i put them on. Also the frame is scrap metal and easily breakable.However the uv protection is great and the shipping was fast. If you are looking into buying these sunglasses you are getting what your paying for, trust me..."
1,costume glasses,Brought these glasses for my Halloween costume for which was fine.Glasses are not well made and would not last with frequent wearing.
3,You get what you pay for,"Although the product isn't terrible, it's what quality that you pay for. For only a few bucks, it's not too bad of a buy, it's just an inexpensive product that proves to be convenient for some times. It's a bit crooked and the frame is pretty unbalanced. If you know how to tweak the lens and fix the hinges, then it might not be a bad buy for you. Overall, the product isn't too bad for only a few bucks like I said."
1,"First, Last Pair of Aviators","They were cheap, and that's the only thing keeping me sane. Poor materials, poor design, and poor manufacturing. Enough said."
4,"Great price, great glasses.","When I got these, I was expecting them to fall apart in my hands. Usually, you can't find aviators for 5$.Of course, they're not the best, but for the price, they're just as good as 10$ or 20$ glasses. Great glasses. Great price."
4,Pretty good,"They came in a pretty sturdy box, wrapped up in plastic, shipped fairly quickly. They're built alright, could be better, but for the price it's excellent. The only issue I have is the lens aren't seated in the frames at the nose bridge properly, and they could be a bit wider, but then again, I could have a slimmer head. All in all, good product, good shipping, would buy again."
1,Aviator Broken,"This product did not last long. I simply kept an optomistic view to it as ""You get what you pay for."" they did not fit well anyway and broke in no time. Never again."
1,chincy glasses...,not impressed... I would not ever buy this product again even though they are so cheap. Good luck and keep looking.
3,not bad,they are sort of flimsy but i have had no problems with them so far. more for the look than a pair of practical sunglasses.
3,Good Enough,"Scratches very easily, so just be careful when removing the sticker from the front of the glasses. Still great though"
1,You get what you pay for,"After finally getting the package from the mail (Because of Labor Day) I opened it up and found the sunglasses inside a cloth case. That's was a plus, however the sunglasses themselves are cheap, you will get what you pay for. The frame was crooked, and the arms were not sitting at the same level. One was higher than the other. The lenses are pretty good (not completely mirrored)."
2,Served Their Purpose,"I bought them to be part of my Lt. Dangle Halloween costume. The price was dirt cheap and so was the quality. Which was fine with me, I only needed it for my costume and had no intention of ever using them again. It was funny, when I got them in the mail there was a tag on them that said ""High Quality."" They were everything but. If you're just looking for something cheap, this is exactly what you want. If you're looking for a pair of aviator's to actually use and wear on a regular basis, I'd find something else."
4,fair price on decent glasses,"I don't spend a lot on sunglasses because I destroy them regularly. I bought these as they were in the right price range for a ""disposable"" item. These are as good as you can expect for this price. They are relatively well made out of decent grade materials. They were a little tight on me, so I bent them out a touch, and now they are comfortable. These are a good value."
5,best for driving on a sunny day,"I bought this for that reason alone, if you are always on the road during sunrise and sunset, this is very helpful. I can stare at the sun and see the incoming traffic. I used pliers to custom fit!"
2,mad,I was not satisfied with this product beacuse the lens was scratched it made me very mad that it was like that
1,Not as advertised,THE DESCRIPTION SAYS SPRING HINGES THESE ARE THE FARTHEST THING FROM SPRING HINGES POSSIBLE. HOW COULD AMAZON LET THESE PEOPLE GET AWAY WITH SELLING SOMETHING THAT ISN'T ACTUALLY ADVERTISED. HOW ABOUT SOME PRODUCT CONTROL PEOPLE.
3,cheap frames,"These are worth the money I suppose, cheap frames i feel like they will break at any moment...do not buy unless you need a cheap pair to just have on hand"
2,Cheaply made,This product is cheaply made. It didn't come in a carry bag it only came in some sealed plastic with tons of fingerprints all over the lens. You get what you pay for.
3,"It's ok, just Ok","The glasses arrived in this small shoe sized box, much larger than one would think necessary for glasses but I guess that's fine.They seem a bit fragile and thin, but then, There is nothing hinting they were sturdy or extra durable. The work just fine for cheap sunglasses.the proportions /size are really nice."
2,Poor viewing quality. Dangerous to drive with.,"First, the build quality isn't bad. What you see is what you get. They are very reflective.However, they're so dark, even under full noon sunlight, it becomes a problem. And it's not just that they're dark... they seem to remove a lot of contrast, making everything look very 'flat'. I tried driving with these on a very bright day and had to take them off... it was becoming dangerous. It makes it difficult to pick out details on the road. I bought two pair of these, and never wear them. I won't buy them again."
1,Mirrored Shades,I was a little disappointed with this product . Rather than being a silver mirrored finish they are a black mirror finish and that was not what I really wanted .
1,DON'T BUY Yagoozon glasses,"I bought a pair of these sunglasses a couple of months ago from WorldWideDynasty Inc and absolutely loved them. I cam back and ordered a second pair last week using the same Amazon page and this time they were sold by Yagoozon. The Yagoozon glasses came with a broken frame and a scratched lens even though they were supposedly new. My previous pair were good quality glasses, but this pair was cheapest of the cheap. The frame is just really cheap wire."
1,Not good at all..,You get what you pay for. These sunglasses are no good. Bought them because it looked like a good deal. Don't make the mistake I made.
4,Decent quality. Cheap but large,"They are no ray bans by far, but the quality is pretty good for the price. The width measurement is a good 66-68mm tho. Which is as big or maybe slightly bigger that a Large pair of ray ban aviators so keep that in mind before making the purchase. But if a large pair of good silver mirrored aviators is what you want it's definitely worth the look"
2,"Flimsy, but great costume accessory","I got these for my husband after he'd sat on yet another pair of sunglasses. (His butt is the destroyer of eye-wear) They were very flimsy, but he looked like he could have been an ""extra"" on top gun. He wore them mostly to make me laugh and ""look cool"". But they have also already been broken."
5,So Hot they were Stolen,"I purchased these for a gift for my teenage son who is extremely picky about his style and clothes... They looked sharp, and fit well... lenses were evenly reflective... and coated... He wore them during the summer for a few months, unfortunately they were stolen from the visor of my car...so will have to order another pair..."
2,Broken,I ordered these 8/14. Have worn them 3 times and the lense has alreay fallen out. Disappointed i really like these glasses.Will order somewhere else next time.
1,You get what you pay for!,"Pretty useless, glass practically popped out as soon as I got them. The lens are very dark to see through. I guess, what did I expect for under $3.I gave them to a homeless guy."
4,Cool Glasses,The glasses fit pretty good and they are very stylish. The only con was that they arrived with ALOT of fingerprints all over the lenses. You can easily get them out tho with a little glass cleaner.
1,Cheap is an understatement!,The same day I received these glasses they broke. Not by my negligence but a bad product. I have sent multiple emails to this company and no response DO NOT BUY!
1,You can't see through these glasses.,"Sometimes inexpensive is just cheap and these glasses fit this category! You can't even see through these glasses, they are so dark. Would not recommend to anyone."
3,Good for the price,"Want extremely cheap aviators? These are the perfect ones for you! Unbelievably cheap, really cheap design, not that comfortable and bad lenses, but hey it is sunglasses for $2, cant beat that! I used them for a costume and they were a hit."
1,not as advertised,These aviators suck. They are shown as having spring hinges...which they do not. They are of poor quality overall and are worse quality than you would get at the 99 cent store. They are going back to where they came. Overall hugely dissatisfied. I would not recommend these.
1,Looks nothing like the picture,These aviators are not very reflective at all. They do not have a silver look to them either. They came all bent up. These glasses don't look like the pictures with the aviator logo displayed. They have more of a black look to them than silver.
3,Eh,"They needed to be filed down around the nose, but it only took all of 30 seconds to do it. now it just has a little bump on it where the extra piece was."
1,they broke,"I love aviators and all, but the first time they slipped off my face they broke, and not the lenses but the arm broke off, not gonna buy from these people ever again."
1,Too big and not aligned right,The aviator sunglasses I received are too large and keep falling off my face. Also there seems to be an alignment problem. The glasses look crooked when they rest on my face.The lenses look good though and they cut off a fair amount of light and UV.Highly disappointed with the overall product.
5,Fantastic!,"These glasses are just awesome! The mirror finish is great, the lenses are dark and they're actually pretty decent quality. I bought them 4 months ago and they're holding up strong. When I first bought them, I was constantly being asked what brand they were and where people could get them, but I like to have something other people don't AND spend much much less on it. So... I don't tell people where I got 'em. Let them spend $50 on a similar pair ;)"
1,Cheap,"After reading all of the glowing reviews for these whack glasses I have come to the conclusion that the reviewers are either from 3rd world countries or have never owned a pair of sunglasses before. You get what you pay for. And for 3 bucks and some odd cents, ya don't get much. These are basically sunglasses that you win at a carnival during a game of balloon pop. They are extremely poorly made, mine came scratched AND they sent them in an envelope with ZERO protective casing!!! It should also be noted that the glasses you get are NOT the ones pictured. The ones in the picture are silver looking but the ones you get are its ugly twin, dull and flat gray. Sure, these may be cool for Halloween if you're going as a hipster or Tom Cruise in Top Gun, but if you seriously intend on wearing these regularly, you will look like a complete d-bag. Seriously. Don't buy these, they are not worth the paper the money is printed on."
4,NICE,"These are nice glasses, a little big for my face, but they work great. I like that they're darker lenses, but they aren't as dark as some people have put in their reviews.Also with the mirror lens, you can check your hair with them (extra benefit)."
1,This voting system is rigged,"THERE IS NO WAY IN A HELL A NORMAL PERSON CAN RATE THIS 5 STARS! The glasses creek when you open them. They feel like flimsy plastic able to break at any given moment. I could see absolutely NOTHING! There is no use returning them because it cost you more than twice as much the cost for shipping both ways. I have no idea why the rating is five stars, maybe for people who wanted to wear them ONCE then throw away but if not DO NOT BUY"
1,Horrible PRODUCT. Do Not order,These glasses are scratched all over and on the lenses. They also appear to be used. Do not order these. It will waste you money.
2,don't believe the pictures,it took them two weeks to get here and they are not the ones that the show in the picturesother then that they work i guess
2,"Not TRUE mirror, and flimsy","These aviators are cheap for a reason...they feel very flimsy, the lens is much smaller than real aviators (which I compared to my own) and most importantly, while the lens is mirror-finish, you can still see through them at your eyes. I wanted something where you could not see through at my eyes...a true mirror lens. Upon inspecting them for less than five minutes I tossed them in the garbage. Oh well...$4.00 down the drain, who cares..."
3,Inexpensive - Just what I ordered,"The sunglasses are extremely inexpensive and just what I thought I'd be getting. They're not particularly well constructed but for the price, it's a good deal. They'd be perfect for a costume or other infrequent wear."
4,Pretty good pair of shades.,"Exactly what I was looking for. Great UV protection, perfect for hot summer days, nothing too extreme, good price. They were a bit larger than expected, but otherwise no complaints."
1,SUCKS!,I will NEVER purchase anything from Amazon again. The glasses were broken and Amazon refused to send me another pair. The glasses suck and made very cheap. Lesson learned.
1,They Were Broke.,Unfortunately I didn't listen to the reviews and it had alot of bad reviews. I took a chance and there.
3,not worth it ..,you get what you pay for .. its too big and too dark .. also the material is really cheap ..
1,Extremely Faulty Sunglasses,"These sunglasses arrived in the mail today, far under my expectations. I was anticipating a cheap pair of glasses, I'll give them that, but not horribly disfigured. The two lenses are almost a centimeter out of line, one bends inwards as well as outwards, and one of the lenses are tilted downwards. The two 'tear drops' are not symmetrical, and the two arms aren't at the same height. Unless you want to look like you've lived in Mexico your whole life, or you tried to make these yourself, don't buy these glasses. They are also not of 'Aviator' brand. They look nothing like the pictures! Don't even 'try' them - shipping them back will cost more than the product itself. They are generic, and extremely bad. For you're own good, Do Not Buy These...'things'."
4,Nice Sunglasses for the price!!!,I like how dark these are its great for someone like me who has light sensitivity. Shipping was quick and for the price you cant go wrong!!!
2,Huge,"Received these glasses fairly quickly because I use Amazon's Free Two Day Shipping.However, these glasses are huge. When we put them on, the sides of glasses barely touch the side of my head!"
2,Glare renders glasses UNUSABLE but stylish.,"These glasses look and feel great for the price, but glare on the lenses leaves them almost useless in the sun. Visibility and contrast are so greatly reduced that I would not feel comfortable walking in these glasses let alone driving in them."
2,SCRATCHED lens in the packaging!!,"I read many reviews saying that these sunglasses were made with very good quality considering the price. I guess thats true, but if you want some sunglasses that are actually meant to be worn, dont purchase these. they look similar to the sunglasses in the picture but are not exactly the same.Not only is the quality terrible, but as I took my sunglasses out of the wrapping i noticed a scratch on one of the lenses! I dont care how much you pay for a pair, they should not arrive already scratched. If it was small and unnoticeable, i probably wouldnt care as much. But its not, its big and right in the middle of the left lens.The only reason i give the product two stars is because it shipped very fast, and came in a small thick cardboard box. I honestly think the box was made with better quality than the sunglasses. Overall, NOT A GOOD PURCHASE."
4,When you just gotta have em,"These sunglasses are perfect if you just gotta have silver mirrored aviators. Comfortable, perfectly mirrored, decent finish. Because of the what they are (not through any manufacturer defect) a decent amount of sun comes in through the sides and reflects inside the glasses making them a bit hard to see with.Still, they look cute, and the price is stellar."
3,Frame too large for a woman,"I wanted an inexpensive pair of mirror shades and decided to try these based on price. They look great, nice big lenses. The problem was the frame is far too large for a woman, even my daughter who is taller and has a slightly larger face shape than me found these too large. These glasses fit my husband well. If you are a man these shades will work well.I wish manufactures would offer a selection of shades for smaller adults. Kids glasses are too small; big peoples are too big..."
2,exactly as advertised,The glasses were great! although the arm did break on my first day of use. But it would cost more than the sunglasses are worth to send it back.
2,Ok for the price,"Lenses very dark and very big. Good build quality, but the nose cushions are tiny (way too small for the large size of the glasses) and I find them uncomfortable, and not a good fit. Good for a cheap secondary pair of sunglasses I guess"
1,You get what you pay for,"I was really excited about these. They are really cute and they were on sale, well as my title states you get what you pay for. I wore these for 1 day and the lense popped out. From then on it would not stay in place and would randomly pop out. I ordered a second pair for my husband and the same thing happened. Very dissapointed"
1,So DARK you can't drive with these nonpolarizing lens,"It's so DARK you can't drive safely with these nonpolarizing lens and even worse, bits of sun glares reflects off the back of lens into my eyes. But for fashion, EPIC MEAL TIMES, BABY! lolI've learned my lesson. Spend more and get POLARIZED lens, which are worth every penny, compared to this."
1,Bad,The lens are very dark to see through. Poor but You get what you pay for.P.s. Worst sunglasses I ever bought!
2,Item is not the same as picture,"The sunglasses I received do not have end pieces, as shown in the picture. The temples are connected directly to the frame"
3,Misleading,"I bought these glasses because I was looking for silver framed, silver mirrored lenses. I decided to buy these for the price. I was impressed because I recieved these glasses a day earlier than expected (because of the Memorial Day weekend). When I opened the package I recieved the wrong pair. Silver frames, but smoke tinted lenses. While I like the glasses I recieved, they were not the ones I ordered or wanted. I'm rating it a three because of the speedy delivery. But it would of been nice to recieve the glasses I thought I had ordered."
1,"sent as a gift - arrived broken, completely embarrased","Glasses arrived broken. Hinge completely bent, glasses unwearable. They were a little surprise christmas gift - I'm completely embarassed. Don't recommend at all."
3,sun glasses,"it was okay... it was not what i expected.. i thought they were a little different like the stores brand but they where not ,but it was okay"
5,Bien,"EXCELENTES CONDICIONES, BUENA COPIA Y EN BUEN ESTADO, RECOMENDADO! ADEMAS DE RESPONSABLE Y CUIDADOSO EN EL ENVÍO, NADA DE TERRAZOS ..."
3,good,"a little shiny, and hard to see through (they really are sunglasses) used them for a dave strider cosplay and they look nice so i suggest them!"
2,Not as described,"Just like so many other people on here have said, these glasses are not ""mirror"" at all. They are relatively dark compared to other cheap sunglasses but when you buy something online you anticipate the item to be as described and shown in the pictures. I'd give one star but for the price I'm going to keep them and try to get a different pair that is actually mirrored."
1,junk,"cheap piece of crap, broke instantly. i bought this for a halloween costumes, but it didnt make it past the first few minutes of the party."
5,Great deal,"Nice, they are really dark like I wanted. wish you could get them without add-ons because they are a great pair a shades."
1,"Cheap, looks like a toy.","The bridge was not aligned correctly and gave me a lopsided look. When I tried to fix it, the frame bended, rendering it useless. I guess I paid for what I got."
4,Just What I Hoped For,I am a disabled Veteran with a TBI. I needed this chain to hold my medical ID Tag. It serves that purpose very well
2,"""2mm Sterling Silver 36"" Bead or Ball Chain Necklace""","I purchased it, and it was perfect for what I ordered it for; but I just tried to clean it in silver cleaner, and it's tarnished to no end.Anyone have any ideas on how to get the shine back? If it cleans up, I'd up the rating to a 5; but right now, I'm feeling ripped off.Thanks"
2,Very thin chain,I guess I expected too much when I ordered this chain. It is very small. I mean the length is great but the width (2mm) is too small. I will keep it. I'll just purchase a bigger one later.
5,Good book to understand Phonetics,This book provides with a clear explanation of the field being of Phonetics and its different features. It also provides clear examples of the different elements it covers.
1,American Revolutionaries in the Making,"Sydnor's work here is dated and ideologically charged. His research is, by today's standards, minimal and is presented to support passe founding-fathers worship and his own normative approval of aristocratic government. The work is better read as a piece of history itself than a work of scholarship. A much more accurate history is available in John G. Kolp's response, Gentlemen and Freeholders: Electoral Politics in Colonial Virginia (1998)."
3,nicely detailed,The Sapphire collection is not for those looking for hardcore art work.It's more about teasing and comedic effect from my experience. Still entertaining though. The elves are colored with great detail and the story is amuzing...
3,erotic fantasy work,"First off, some people need to be able to know what is and isn't an elf. Pointed ears usually means the character is an elf. Round ears, they aren't.Sapphire and the other female forest warriors aren't elves. They make the point that the elves are a race they try to protect.Be warned that this volume is a bit more explicit then the first volume! And it ends on a cliffhanger. Wonder when this series will continue."
3,The Photographer's Guide to Marketing ans Self-Promotion,"There are a number of books of this kind that deal with promoting photographers in the digital realm. This book is quite strong in using advertising as a tool, direct and e-mail marketing and promotional pieces."
3,OK information,"This book has some good information, but I was expecting a lot more. I would recommend ""The Business of Studio Photography"" by Lilley instead."
3,great tool,"i felt as though this book had all the things i needed to help get my name out there as well as my work. extremely informative, helpful,and easy to work with."
5,New kind of historicals,"I have read Anne Stuart, this is my first historical by her. I think her contemporary books are great. I think the same of her historicals.This is a good book. Dark and dangerous, once you start to read it you dont want to stop. For some reason, even though it is romance and a historical, it still falls into its own category. You wont find another author line Anne Stuart, not one that is even close. I wouldnt reccomend this to just anyone though, cant be squemish and think romance books are not ever dark. Those who enjoy those types of books as well are in for a rare treat."
2,Misogynistic,"Anne Stuart has writing chops, but I can't get behind the misogynism that permeates ""To Love a Dark Lord."" Uncle Harold tries to rape Emma at an inn; she kills him in self-defense. Killoran, bored but intrigued, rescues Emma by claiming he did it, and no one messes with Killoran. Killoran rescues her again and again while publicly seducing her. The heroine, Emma, is strong-hearted, brave, etc., etc., yet yearns for Killoran almost against her will. Lady Barbara is a slut, although eventually we find out why she has such low self-worth. Emma's evil cousin is a fanatic who hates Emma as the embodiment of female sexuality as much as she loves Emma's inheritance.In fact, every man, except the saintly Nathaniel, who meets Emma attempts to rip her bodice and ""take her"" to make her submit or to punish another man. Modernly, we call this attempted rape.Reading this book is like watching a train wreck. Turn away, please, there's nothing here to see."
2,so-so,"Not that great, lots of info, most of which I already know. I wish there were more about the symptoms of menopause, which there are, but I needed more information. It's good because it recommends way to get through menopause without taking hormone replacement therapy, which I firmly believe causes breast cancer. But it was padded with pretty basic information that wasn't that innovative."
3,Interesting,My sister referred this book to me and I have browed through it and hope to use the guidelines to have a happier and healthier life
2,"Beautiful pictures, but...","I'm sure this gentleman Randy Florke is immensely talented. I certainly LOVE the rooms featured in Country Living magazine. But I honestly didn't find many ideas I could actually use in my small 1300 sq. ft. 1800's house with 7 ft. ceilings.I'd have to agree with Nancy's review that many of the ideas are not practical. How are my kids going to sit on those metal chairs? And with dogs, I could NEVER put out the kind of accessories lower than 3 ft. or they'd be munchie snacks. I guess I was hoping for more inspiration.I did like his use of large paintings in small spaces to open up that one room. Beautiful style, but not a real how-to book. Show the problem, and show the solution. That's the kind of book I need."
5,"Visually Pleasing, Inspiring, & Great narration",Loved everything about this book. He has a lot of interesting observations and ideas. I found it extremely inspiring for my home. We are a family of 5 with dogs and I appreciate his use of the found objects. Not only is it economical but if it withstood use by another family then it can take what we have to dish out. And on the plus side the older stuff is much more interesting looking. Highly recommend this book.
5,I Just Bought Another Copy,"I'm liking Your House Your Home so much that I just ordered another copy for a friend who I know will love it also.I thought it was the most practical and down-to-earth and realistic decorating book that I've ever seen. The photographs are beautiful, and the advice the kind of thing a real person can easily use."
3,"Just ""OK""","For hanging a picture frame, towel bar, shelf, etc this tool will work fine. If one plans on installing molding, framing, plumbing lines or conduit a ""higher end"" laser line generator is better choice. The one I have is off by a 1/2in at 15ft which is unacceptable for any kind of professional application. The pushpin/sticky pad methods of holding the unit to a surface aren't convenient for use on a job-site. Bottom line, handymen or DIY'ers that need to mount some picture frames, TV brackets & such would benefit from this tool. As a contractor I keep it in a general carpentry tool bag for occasional, spur of the moment uses.Update: After very little use the smallest bubble vial on the back of the arm has leaked making the tool that much more useless."
1,Unbelievably bad.,"I bought this at a local home center, but when I got it home found that it was at least 5 degrees off level--the bubble didn't agree with the laser. Worse, there is no way to adjust either the bubble or the laser to make them sync up. I took it back."
5,Wonderful and very handy level !!,"It is very small and easy to have in tool box. In many situations it works much better than a standard level, and is very small and easy to use."
1,picture doesn't represent product orientation.,"The Products picture is shown sitting like it could be used on a tripod or placed a top a ladder, But that is not the way the product works. You can't just sit the thing and project a line. It must be held in place by another person or fastened with push pins or there patented double face tape.It was complete disappointment when it arrived."
2,Doesn't work and no fixable parts,"We purchased this a while back, and I didn't save the warranty (dumb).I thought this would be a grand help in re-tiling the bath. But after under an hour use, the light went out. I tested batteries, installed new ones all to no avail. The manufacturer's web site says there are no serviceable parts. So, other than a paperweight I don't see a use. That's quite a bit on money to blow on something that can't be fixed."
2,maybe i should have bought a tape measure instead.....,"I bought this gadget to save time, mistakes, etc. installing new chair rail in 2 large rooms. I spent an hour just trying to figure out it's accuracy level which, unlike other lasers, is not stated on the box nor the instruction/spec sheet inside. The jury is still out on accuracy since the instructions do not include explanations for many of the features it seems to have so I will try to figure them out as I go - or maybe I'll just return it for a better model. Stay tuned.........."
1,Eyes Of The Da Vinci Code,"A very evident attempt to catch a ride on the coattails of The Da Vinci Code's popular success (check out the similarity of the cover art on the two books). Released as a mass-market paperback, this reads more like a fleshed out synopsis than a finished work.Monteleone isn't a terrible writer and his characters have enough differentiation that you don't confuse one for the other (always a plus!). The story advances via the viewpoints of the central five characters and the author does an admirable job of maintaining VP integrity while doing this (i.e. we don't have VP switching back and forth within a particular scene or episode).All the same, a goodly amount of editing could have been done, even to the cover copy which identifies the female protagonist as ""Kate Hudson"" while all through the book she is presented as ""Kate Harrison""."
5,not hippy new age taoism,"i saw an earlier review where a girl was unhappy with this book because it wasn't hippy new age taoism. actually, her review was pretty fair - the book just wasn't what she wanted it to be. but i thank my lucky stars it wasn't. this book gives real guidance to people like me who want to practice taoism. isn't that exactly what the taoist community needs? no more endless speculation about philosophy that may not even have any connection to taoism. instead, this book taught me how taoists approach their calendar, their deities, and their practices. it doesn't make me a taoist, and maybe i'll never be one, but at least now i have a better appreciation for who they are and how they live. that's all i could ever ask for. great book, i highly recommend it."
2,"Overpriced, but good information","When I bought this book, it was listed at $120. I was very pleased at the information inside, as it answered many questions that I had about Taoist philosophy and religion. The only problem I have is that after I purchased the book and took it out of its packaging, I noticed a sticker on the back that listed it at $20. I feel like that is the true worth of this book. I only give it two stars because even though I feel that I payed way too much for the item, the book itself had very good information to get one started on their research of Taoism and gives one a better understanding of the religious side of Taoism. So, if you feel that the book is worth that much, go ahead and make the purchase. It is only my opinion that the $20 sticker I found on the back of the book is how much the book is really worth."
2,cheap,"Cheaply made with horrible acting. Typical vampire storyline, boy vampire meets human girl and turns her....where have I seen that one before?"
3,A good movie to cure insomnia.....,I gave this movie 3 stars only because of its locale and loved the house....The female lead? I think being bitten was thebest thing that ever happened to her as she seemed to be void of personality and anything of interest to say...bad actorsreally....I wonder where their careers went after this movie? Novice movie making to say the least...notice a few movies Ihave seen from Createspace are below par....I will check them out and get back to this review at a later date....
4,It's Actually Pretty Good,"I was not expecting much and found it was entertaining. The only reason I didn't give it a five star was there was an editing error (see if you spot it), and it was slow in a couple of places (didn't need a walk sequence to take as long as it did). They did well in casting, and more areas than can be listed. The creative team really spent their money well, it has an unusual twist. I am not going to give it away, you will already be getting a steal at $1.99."
1,bad game,"this game is bad. the graphics ar ethe worst! if they made the game for gameboy color it would be better! the gameplay is also bad. boring missions, and a looong loading time. it takes almost 5 minutes to load the game! i bought it because the back cover showed good graphics and neat screen shots. i don't suggest you get this game because you probally won't play it more than 4 times. i think it might have been better if there was a multiplayer. there is a lot of weapons and items, but there isn't much difference so it doesn't matter which gun you choose."
1,This is a joke right?,"This edition of the Spec Ops series is almost as bad as the Playstation version. The graphics aren't very good and this is a Dreamcast game! The controls make this game a pain to play and just look at the corny title! ""Omega Squad""? Give me a break. I can't believe they've made 9 sequels to this dull series."
1,Disappointed to a serious horseplayer in Hong Kong,Very disappointed. This book actually teaches me nothing on turf handicapping. Perhaps this is because the main stream of horse racing in the United States is dirt racing.
3,Variations on a theme,"The last time I listened to John Foxx was The Garden. His cold robotic style and minimalistic lyrics have always been vaguely interesting mainly due to his unique voice. With Crash And Burn John has maintained the simplicity of his early work but has stripped it of some of the charm (if I can use that term). Crash & Burn starts out with some promise. Drive, Cinema & Broken Furniture are very much in the Foxx tradition, but the high points thereafter are few and far between. Lyrically Crash & Burn is a bit weak and their repetition is only interesting when backed by good melodies which is also lacking here. I'm not sure what role Louis Gordon plays in this production but I think John needs a new collaborator."
1,"By hook or by crook, this is the worst book!","This is without doubt the worst book I have ever read. It is so badly written, it is almost impossible to finish. I wish I hadn't wasted my valuable time reading it, and I would strongly advise anyone thinking of buying it not to! The Kindle version doesn't even allow you to navigate from chapter to chapter. This book has the ignominy of being the only one I've downloaded from Amazon and subsequently permanently deleted from my library. Poor show!"
2,Lots of fluff but little meat,"After reading the reviews and the title, I had expectations about the information in this book. I expected some useful tips on writing style and organization and received very little real information. I found the constant quotes and urls after every chapter extremely distracting and annoying and found that most of tips were simple common sense.All in all, I was very disappointed."
3,Eloquent yet Common Information,"With so many books available on how to make money writing nonfiction, few offer anything new to stand apart from the rest of the genre. Writing Nonfiction by Dan Poynter is thorough yet represents information that is presented in nearly every other nonfiction producing book.There is valuable insight in the book as Poynter's clearly knows what his material, yet too many books are already available on how to produce material that will sell, how to format your writing, how to edit, and many other of the basic details included. I have read several books in the genre and although this book was adequate, I found nothing new to set it apart."
4,GREAT and to the point. Publish it your self and profit!!,"This is a good book, and a short version of the THE SELF PUBLISHING MANUAL by the same author; both books are good, however I enjoyed best THE SELF P.M. which I will rate it 5 starts. Enjoy!!"
1,"mr. poynter, this is unfortunate","I am a fan of Dan Poyter's, and I have learned a lot from this author's monumental work, ""The Self-Publishing Manual"". I thought this title, ""Writing Nonfiction : Turning Thoughts into Books"", is another one of such great works.I was so disappointed while reading this book when I realized that it was nothing but a rehash of the original book. I just could not understand how a professional author could have the audacity to publish the same book under two different titles and sell both to the same audience. I don't know if you get, I just don't.To make matters worse, this title is not as detailed as the original work. So, if you are interested in learning from this man, I suggest that you get a copy of ""The Self-Publishing Manual"", rather than this one.I gave this book 1 star, not because it does not contain useful information, but because it contains nothing new from the author's previous publication. It is really unfortunate. I felt cheated."
1,I am disappointed with the lack of substantial content in this book,"The amount of motivational jargon and quotes is overwhelming, and not useful. The amount of practical information on writing a non-fiction amounts to little more than a few sentences of generalizations. He suggests we make piles on our desk for each chapter?? Thank you for that. This was a waste of $7.00. The reviews appear to be talking about some other book - not this one."
5,writing nonfiction review,Very Informative. This is my fourth purchase of a Dan Poynter publishing book. Each book includes a wealth of Good Publishing Info !!!
5,Help for the novice writer,"This book is full of practical information for writing and publishing a nonfiction book. It presents an effective outline for the whole process, including action steps in a logical and useful format.As an aspiring writer, I found the book to be very helpful, especially in providing the impetus and logistics to ""get going"". It takes the mystery out of the process so that the novice writer can get started."
3,A Good Book to Start With,"I enjoyed this book. I am well advanced in writing a non-fiction book which I intend to self publish. Having read two other books about writing non-fiction and self publishing, I had some subject knowledge to start with. In spite of this, I learnt a number of new ideas and the book brought clarity to a few issues. I think that this book is a great book to start the writing non-fiction and self publishing journey."
2,Proceed with Caution,"I found this book easy to read, and it was clear that Mr. Poynter follows his own advice on how to design front and back covers, construct chapters, etc. However, after reading this and another of this authors books, it started to feel like an advertisement for the self publishing industry. Since Mr. Poynter is in that business, and much information is made available from his business to further help authors, I began to feel like I was on the receiving side of a sales pitch towards the end of the book. I did pick up a few ideas, which were of great value. However, I think this book has one, but not the only, and for some authors, not necessarily the best, perspective."
4,"Great Quality, Reasonably Priced","I've looked for Acacia powder in stores to no avail. I have found it on a few websites, but always sold in huge quantities at a large price. This bottle is the perfect size if you are wanting to make gomme syrup for authentic mixed cocktails ( a dacquari made from scratch with gomme syrup, over ice....too die for! ). Im a fan."
2,Difficult to work with,"This is an unusual product. It does work but it needs to be dissolved separately and with heat before addition to what you are making. I tried to make Marshmallow root marshmallows with it and it did not work. This product however will stiffen up gelatin marshmallows so it does work. I cannot say this product is very useful as very few recipes ever call for it but it is cool conversation piece. Also, it might be a good product to rescue your emulsion that you are making if the chemistry is right but you will have to discover that for yourself. Just be careful of lumps when using this product, dissolver thoroughly before adding."
3,the black one doesn't work,"delivery is fast. they offer me a replacement, but the black one still doesn't work."
3,"Music first-rate, band so-so","Purchaser beware--this is not the original Dukes of Dixieland but a band using their name. What saves the DVD is Jelly Roll's music but the band is a journeyman combo at best, lacking the flare and energy of the group headed by the Assunto brothers and Papa Jack that once recorded on the Audiophile label and, at one time, featured Pete Fountain."
2,not for beginers,"I started knitting not long ago, and this book was too advanced for me. No color pictures."
1,She's no Elizabeth Zimmermann,"This book is dedicated to Elizabeth Zimmerman the knitting Guru.Thats about the only thing that gives this book credibility.Her directions for the basic tam start out okay but she doesn't tell you when to switch from circular to double pointed.then she tells you to decrease using one less stitch but from then on your on your own until the very end.I finished my Tam with no enthusiasm to try another.I anxiously await the arrival of knitting without tears by Elizabeth Zimmermann she lived a long life but I wish she was still around,I knit again because of her inspiration .I buy books to learn how and for guidance.I guess Mary forgot what its like to not know how to make something.Buy knitting without tears unless your experienced"
4,"LITTLE BOOK, BIG LAUGHS!","Collectors beware. If, like me, you already have all the Two Ronnies' joke books from the 1970s, plus Ronnie Barker's excellent anthology ""All I Ever Wrote"", then you really don't need this ""best of"" collection.Still, it's a nice variety of material from their long running BBC TV series: their ""news"" jokes, sketches, and monologues, but, regrettably, NOT their musical parodies, perhaps for space reasons. Also, there's an unfortunate tendency to just pull random lines out of Ronnie Corbett's shaggy dog stories, spoiling the effect somewhat.HOWEVER...If you judge it on its OWN merits...as a convenient, pocket-sized sampler and affectionate souvenir of the duo's comedy it's very good, and DEFINITELY very funny. A final GOOD night from ""Me"" (Ronnie Corbett) and ""Him"" (Ronnie Barker). Bless 'em."
1,eighty dollars?!?!?!,"Honestly, you can get a 5-pound bar of hershey's chocolate for 35 dollars on the hershey's website. here it costs over 79 dollars."
1,$100? What kind of maniac.......,"What kind of maniac pays $100, plus s&h, for a 5 pound chocolate bar? No wonder the kid in the picture has no teeth!"
3,not what expected but does the same job,"first let me say the product is not the same as the picture. The base doesn't come with two magnets that go on the door and door frame. Instead the base goes on the door and the single magnet goes on the door frame. The second thing I would have to mention is the magnet must be touching the base when the door is closed, if you attach them any further apart the alarm won't function properly. At first I thought the product was defective, but after much trial and error I was able to attach them close enough. 120db is very loud! You will not want to set the alarm off more than once. I'm very confident that if a thief set it off, they would run after it went off, but I should mention that I live in an apartment. The product works fine just as described and I feel safer sleeping at night now."
3,Neither rockin' nor rump-shakin',"In light of the glowing reviews for LCD Soundsystem's singles, ""Movement"" is downright unimpressive. The song is a generic slice of dance-punk that's almost danceable and comes close to rockin' out without achieving either goal. For all the acclaim James Murphy gets from critics, you'd think he could write a memorable chorus or catchy hook. Based upon ""Movement"", you'd be wrong. This single might appeal to fans of innocuous MTV fare like Fatboy Slim or The Killers, but it doesn't approach the excitement or innovation of similar artists like The Rapture, The Fall or early Cure."
3,NOT as good as UGGS,"I bought these because they cost less than UGGS, but I wish the reviews said they run smaller than UGGS and are not as comfortable. They do look nice on... but are not roomfy like UGGS and are hard to put on... the opening around the ankle is tight and you have to struggle to get the boots on....((I saw other reviews said the same thing))-If you want to spend less money and you're not worried about ""NAME BRANDS"" then these are a great buy -- just remember they to buy a size BIGGER than you normally wear ((where as uggs you'd buy a size smaller))"
4,Very comfortable,"Although they are really comfortable and warm, I suggest that if you need more space for thicker socks that you get a size up. I am a size 6 in almost all shoes except Uggs(because they run a whole size bigger). I received a size 6 in these Bearpaw boots for Christmas last year, and they fit perfectly while wearing regular socks, but there was only a tiny bit of room in the toe area so they felt a little tight. It wasn't much of a bother to me though, and they're really comfortable and cute. The boots also seemed to slip onto my feet just fine."
2,bearpaw 419 boot,"This boot fits nicely, but not as warm as my 10"" boot. I have hardwood floors in my house, and I have to wear socks with this boot. Not enough padding between boot and floor. I rate it a two star."
2,Opening Too Tight,As recommended I ordered the next size larger. Not only was the size too small but like many other reviewers I found the opening at the top of the boot too tight. I returned the boots to Luggage Biz and was charged the 5% restocking fee as indicated by their return policy.
5,Perfect!,"These boots are amazing! I was nervous to order them based on some of the other reviews I read, but I'm so glad I did! They are super warm and comfortable and definitely an unbeatable price. Perfect boots for winter. I absolutely recommend these to anyone who wants a nice boot for a low price."
3,Glorified winter socks,I bought these shoes to wear outside in the snow for Chicago winter. I usually wear a size 6.5 but bought a size 7 since these shoes don't come in half sizes. They're quite roomy inside and cut just the right height for me - ankle high. I found them pretty warm and toasty only if worn with thick winter socks but provide no support whatsoever to the feet - nither the soles nor sides of the feet. It's like walking outside in your socks. I wore them once to walk around in a mall and my feet were tired within a few minutes of walking. I wish I'd paid a little more and got real winter shoes.
2,Too Small!,"I was so excited to find these boots, only to be disappointed when I received them! They ran very small and were SO hard to get on! I actually needed a shoehorn!! After wrestling them on my feet, I stood up and my toes were rammed into the front of the boot. SO sad! I ordered my normal size (9) and even have a different pair of similar boots in chestnut (they are 8"" ones) that fit great...unfortunately, these did NOT fit the bill at ALL and I'll be returning them for sure."
1,Very Disappointed,"Product ordered size 9 regular Bearpaw 419-Demi in black. Compared to same boot already own, these were HUGE/WIDE. Had to return AND PAY $10 RESTOCKING FEE for a boot that was too big. Own 2 pairs, same product, same size...they fit perfect. Bottom said 9W, I think they are wides, they say they don't make wides. Ordered same product/different color from Amazon at same time, they fit perfect + free shipping. Will buy again if seller is Amazon, or in store to try on."
5,My Bearpaws!,Afer reading many reviews I ordered these demi boots. I loved them from the beginning...very warm and comfortable. They were a bit difficult to get on at first but soon became easier. I would recommend these boots to everyone!
2,disappointed,"I have an old pair of bear paws boots that I LOVE. They are warm and comfortable and have held up well over the past 3 years. I bought these boots with high expectations and I am very disappointed. The sole is thin and not at all cushy nor comfortable. The lining is fuzzy but not nearly as warm as my old boots. They also run small. I ordered one size up to accomodate winter socks and they are tight/short without socks. I would say these boots are comparable to the $15 boots sold in walmart - not at all what I would expect from Bear Paws, especially for this price."
5,Feels like slippers,"I bought the Bearpaw demi boots and they keep my feet warm & dry. They are very comfortable. They suggest you buy one size larger, which I did, and they fit great. I do suggest you spray on suede protectant to keep them looking good. I would definitely recommend these to anyone."
4,comfy,Great little boot for winter! Foot opening too small for larger sizes. I went from a 9 to 10 and opening still too small.
4,Snuggly and Toasty Boots,"OMG! These are so fabulous, especially for the price! Less that half the price of other major name brands, that are similar in quality. Shipped in one day, with super saver shipping. Thank you Amazon, you always deliver an excellent product!"
1,Worn out & blistered in a short time,"Cheap materials; bad design --should be sold as 'slippers,' not boots!These were wonderfully comfortable for the first few hours. But after only a few weeks of ownership, after walking on flat pavement probably not more than 5 miles total, the sole on both of these boots split all the way across at the metatarsal, all the way through to the insole. The sheep wool around the foot packs down within a few hours of putting them on, forever losing its comfortable fluffiness. After the wooly lining has packed down, the fit loosens, then the boots move around on the feet while walking, causing rubbing in the heel. The heel also seems to be shaped wrong. The boots rubbed the edge of my heel on both feet, producing callouses with big blisters underneath. Couldn't walk in shoes for a few weeks until my feet healed. Don't try to walk around town in these!"
2,Poor quality,"Loved my demi boots when I got them for Christmas, but here it is Jan.17th and my bear paw demi boots are worn through across the toes on the right boot. The suede appears to be quite thin in this area, and there are visible holes. Since this was a gift, and I don't have a receipt, I can't return them. What a disappointment."
1,Terrible quality. Skip this and invest in Costco Kirkland boots!,"I bought 2 pairs of BearPaw shoes because I saw that they were on sale on Slickdeals. I had to return BOTH the Women's Knit Tall Knee-High Boot and the Women's Demi Boot within 2 weeks because the quality was so terrible. One of them started coming apart at the sole. The other had glue all over the place. You could tell they were made very cheaply.Also, I noticed that the knit boots (cardy copy) are *very* heavy.... about twice as heavy as the Ugg name brand ones (which I've since invested in and having been wearing frequently for a year)BUYER BEWARE... there are better brands out there. Costco actually has the BEST sheepskin boots. I swear they are identical to the real things. Check it out... they usually stock them during the winter"
5,Cozy Toes,"I wear a 7.5, and got these in an 8. Fits good, not snug but a little loose. I actually like this type of fit for house slippers and I can slip my feet right in without bending down. I also don't wear socks with these. If I was going to wear these outside I would have opted for a size 7 and it would have probably stretched to fit perfectly. I think the shearling in Ugg's is definitely of a higher quality than the Bearpaw's but for me, these do the job and costs a lot less. I noticed some reviews saying these looked cheap... Maybe I got lucky, but my pair looks and feels like they are well made."
5,"Bearpaw boots, Graco Car Seat, DeLonghi Panini Maker","I have ordered three items from Amazon.com within the last three weeks...the service, the website, the quality of the merchandise..everything is great...thank you for the excellent quality of the merchandise...the value...the timely shipping.."
4,Great boots,"purchased the boots, love the color, I have a high instep and they are a little difficult to get on, but hopefully overtime they will stretch a little. True to size, very warm."
3,Nice,"This is a very sturdy wire rack would go great in a wire precision crate, not a true 36 inches , 34 , it won't fit in an extra large pet mate plastic kennel and is too small for a giant kennel , so I am sending it back , but it is a nice and sturdy would fit right in the pan of a wire crate and be very sturdy ,and keep dogs out of any messes, or spilled water. Very nice , just not what I need ."
2,Corporate Greed Ruins Good Shaver...,"The shave I get with this is fine, but be warned: The Norelco SpeedXL series has a built in blade life. Once Norelco thinks you need to change the blades (and they tend to think you should spend the $36 more often than you will want), the shaver disables itself.The way it does this is that it turns on the ""change blade"" warning LED. And this LED uses so much power that it drains the batteries in just over one day. Worse yet, the shaver will not operate unless the battery is charged, so this results in a dead shaver until you replace the blades.Way to go Norelco. I used to be a big fan."
1,This shaver failed after one month's useI,"This is the third Norelco Phillips Norelco shaver I have used. The first two were very good.This one is very bad. I bought it in Wal-Mart, San Antonio, Texas, January 2008. I took it to Mexico, where it failed February 1, 2008. A light grey plastic part that supports & aligns one cutting head broke. I am still in Mexico, & don't have the orignial package, etc. to return it under guarantee. But I do want to warn future buyers (& sellers) that internal plastic parts are fragile. The Jet Clean System is also ridiculous."
1,consumer,"Tried this item twice, sent one back to manufacturer (two months later received another one). Both had the same problem the cleaner base does not work, the light blinks but thats all it does."
1,Don't waste your money!,"Have used 7 or so study guides including 2 other Test Success books, this one was the worse and nearly useless. Outlines gave NO additional detailed information just brief, cursory statements; not even enough to study from. Questions are repetitive and test information, not even covered in book. Stick with Exam Cram books, over the Sybex Test Success line... Very dissapointing, should not have been published."
1,out of focus,"This book got it all wrong . It has not got any idea of what's on the exam and does not test the application part of any topic ,which is excatly what is needed .Some of the topics are unnecessarily stressed upon."
2,Not enough to pass the exam,"I red this book to pass the exam I found some very useful questions but a lot of questions where off track you need definitely some other books to really pass the exam, save your money"
2,A Flop in the test Success series,"I have used all of the Test Sucess series books (Not Exclusively - hint) To assist me in becoming an MCSE. This book was off track in a lot of ways, the low ratings are justified in this case. Fast Track and the Exam notes for TCP/IP were more helpful in the prep work."
2,Not a good preparation for the exam,"If you're looking for a book with questions that will prepare you for the TCP/IP for NT 4.0 MCSE exam, I suggest that you buy a different book. I used this book to prepare for the exam, and found that the format and actual content of the questions were much different from those presented in the book. Specifically, the book is very lacking in the areas of internetwork browsing and Unix integration, areas which I found the actual exam to focus on extensively. If you're taking the exam, make sure to find a book that covers these topics adequately."
1,Not as good as other Test Success books,I'm very dissapointed with this book. I have read others Test Success books and this is the worst. This book is not test oriented. In some chapters it just give you some general information of TCP/IP on NT. In others it goes into many NT details that I thought I was studing for NT Server test again.
4,CORNY GOOD FUN IN THE BACKWOODS,"If you like corny movies that you can relax and just enjoy, this one is for you. Two likeable characters go to out-of-way cabin to relax. but relaxation is the furthest thing on there minds when they save the life of an alien, who turns into a pretty woman(Julia Roberts no offence),try and stop a maleviolent alien who's out to take over the earth with his evanglist messages over the radio.And held prisoners by the local wackos who think they're the aliens. It is good clean fun."
2,film cartridge,"i absolutely love the idea of the cartridge , everything self contained in a small unit "" but i have unfortunately had the misfortune of losing 3 cartridges due to the wrinkling and jamming of the color cellaphane in the cartridge..deeming the cartridge unusable thus losing over 150 pics ..im not happy ..did not get a good response from the company as my time lapse from purchase to use and their return policy had expired ( i was told to contact the manufacturer directly ) ..i dont usually print out 100s of pictures at once so i basically lost about $50.00 worth of film not to mention im apprehensive about getting more .. i will say ,when the little machine and the film cartridges work properly, i love the pictures ..especially with the post card concept ..."
5,post card ink/paper,"This is so convenient! It came VERY quickly; I can print my photos as if I had been to the drug store. Equal amounts of ink & paper in one, simple to use package."
5,Pleased with Cartridge,Extremely easy to use and I love the Canon Selphy Printer which is the printer that the cartridges are used with.Been using them for several years with complete satisfaction.
5,Photo paper,It is the second time I purchased photo paper from Amazon.com and I was satisfied both times. Easy purchse and received when promised.
4,Not Sure,Product arrived quickly but not sure if I missed in the listing that this film was expired or if they failed to say it. The pictures I printed came out fine but wonder if they would have been better if the film was not 5 months expired when I got it.
3,Somewhat pleased.,"I was verry pleased with the expedience of receiving the merchandise, however I was suppose to receive 2 packs (50 each) in the photo packs and one of them was opened and only contained 30. That was not what I thought that I was getting."
5,Great phone - long lasting batteries,I really liked this phone for many reasons - good clarity - long battery life - sturdy design and ease of use. The features are better than many other phones I have had including sending the phonebook from one phone to another. Consider this phone - the base unit and the additional units if you want a good home phone.
4,Expandable Panasonic Phone,Panasonic KX-TGA560M 5.8 GHz FHSS GigaRange Expandable Digital Cordless HandsetSmall issues were quickly corrected by the vendor and the replacement systems works great...
4,Good Movie,My only complaint with this otherwise good movie is the ending left me hanging. It could have been run another ten minutes to wrap things up more neatly.
1,A book by a realtor for realtors,"This is a decent guide about how to select a realtor and prioritize what you are looking for in a home. However, most of the book is a dissertaion on the home real estate industry and why realtors are so important. They are essential in the process, but there are many more varialbles in the equation. Mortgages, offers, and inspections are some of these variables, which are barely glossed over in this tome.I found Kiplinger's ""Buying and Selling a Home"" much more comprehensive and useful.""Buyer Beware"" is, ironically, aptly named."
4,"different parts, different books.","I agree with the author of the review on the back of the book. a little of the first two parts were good, most of the next two sections were good, and the last part was fantastic. overall, a good book. but dont use it as your go to for zen practice, and don't make it your first book on Zen."
1,Go to Walmart instead!,"I wish I would have known before I bought this product that you could buy this from Walmart for 2 DOLLARS AND CHANGE! This seller is ripping us off. You can buy three for the price that they are selling one. PLEASE learn from my mistake and do not buy from this seller! The product is wonderful, and moisturizes my 4c hair very well. But I would never purchase from Beauty in Black again."
3,S-Curl Activator And Moisturizer,"Was ordered for someone else,sorry that's all I can tell you about this order except the person has used for a number of years and like it"
2,Black Relaxed Hair,I tried this on dry hair. I used it to moisturize one of my braid outs and it made my hair sticky. Next time I will try it on wet hair.
5,Great Chicago blues sounds,"This is a great CD and DVD, especially the title track. Anyone with half an interest in Chicago blues must own."
5,"What a deal - Great performance, great footage.","Try to catch the live Performance, it's wonderful. Tracy sure can carry her voice. It is a real pleasure seeing these guys perform together and with a Great Rhythm section. The dvd has wonderful historic footage. It makes you realize how fortunate they were to grow up in Chicago and what these performers did to bring the Blues to the rest of us."
5,5 stars are not enough!,"""Buried Alive in the Blues"" is certainly one of the best live Blues albums of all times. Those who had and will have a chance to see the Chicago Blues Reunion onstage may proudly say: ""I've seen the Blues history in the making!"" It's not a nostalgy album, it's a strongest proof of an everlasting freshness and youth of the Chicago Blues. All those who took part in the album recording, production, design and marketing have done a great job, and the result may already be considered as a treasure of not just American but the World music culture."
5,I love the music of Nick Gravenites,Great songs and perfomances and a bonus DVD with itwhat could be betterI only wish I could have seen one of the shows myself
3,Compelling Read,"This is an important work that gives a frank perspective and historical account of Kenya, and the forces tugging at it. Mr Hempstone is a gifted writer, and this book reflects that. His reference to Mau Mau freedom fighters as terrorists leaves much to be desired. This is fact is a misrepresentation of Mau Mau. Mau Mau helped Kenya achieve independence from Britain (its means may not have been diplomatic, nevertheless, kenyans were liberated from the yoke of colonialism.) Apart from this fact, I would recommend it to anyone seeking a detailed account of the events of those years, but to caution you that this is infact written with lots of baggage that is the character of this man (he seems to relish the days of colonialism, yet he (and the US)did have an impact (positive or negative to Kenyans we do not know yet). Compelling and insightful."
5,Perfect.,This was exactly what my sister wanted for her birthday. I paid for expedited shipping and it arrived ahead of schedule. :) Thank you!
5,major price change,The product is great and is real this is not a fake i got mine today and i love it. But i payed 60 for miñe but now 1 week later its 36 whats with that? O well still was worth it
5,Finally!,My absolute favorite show when I was a kid. So excited to see an official dvd release. So excited to see this. Can't wait to watch it again. Awesome series.
4,digimon movie,I bought this one for my grandson and he like it alot. He and my son watches it over and over. Because of the age of these movies they are hard to find and azamon is the olace to go and buy them
5,Excited,"Awhile back I asked for this on Shout! Factory's site but never got any post replys and since their doing Power Rangers and Beetleborgs,i'm okay with that since this is coming to dvd-I JUST HOPE WE GET ALL THE SEASONS CUZ I LUV RENAMON!!! She was my favorite partner in Season 3 LOL!!!"
5,80?? 30 at walmart..,So glad they are finally releasing this season as a DVD set! Can't wait for the others to be released as well.. But i second the comment made about Walmart having it listed for $34.86 and theres even somewhere else listing it for $60.00 so look around before you purchase this from Amazon.. Cannot wait. Theres a 36 page booklet with sketches and character descriptions which is also a nice bonus :)
4,Everything you expect,"This set contains the entire first season beginning to end. VERY lacking in the special features department. All it has is a photo gallery on the last disk and that's it. It is in English ONLY no dual audio. It does include a very nice booklet showcasing the different forms of all 8 main character's digimon. On a strange side note, the booklet also includes English lyrics for the Japanese opening, ending, and digivole song. Which makes me wonder why they didn't include a Japanese audio track with subtitles. Over all it's a great collection for someone trying to get the American version of the show, just know they the American version is retooled for a more conservative audience and quite a bit different, it is eitherA. Cut out orB. RewrittenIf you can look past that I say get it and enjoy."
5,Just as good as I remember,"I've watched several shows I used to LOVE in my childhood, only to find out they were better left untouched, but that's not the case with this one. Still good!"
5,Finally!,"The official Digimon! Awesome!Now, I do wish this was closed captioned. I'd love to see it in the original Japanese with subtiltes someday, but just direct English subs seem like common courtesy on a DVD collection like this.Otherwise? Everything I love in a neat little package that doesn't require me to hook my portable harddrive to my TV! This is really awesome. Can't wait for season 2!"
1,Price is absolutely ridiculous!,I was not lucky enough to see this movie when it was on TV in 1980 and I suppose I never will because I can't afford $59.95-$115.36 for a VHS tape! This is absolutely ridiculous! I wouldn't be able to sleep at night taking advantage of people like this!
1,very disappointing. Look else where,"We were in the Caribbean this last November and heard wonderful steel drum and Caribbean style Christmas music throughout our stay there. When we returned, I thought it would be fun to have some Christmas music with a Caribbean or steel drum style as we heard during our stay. After reading the wonderful reviews, I ordered this CD.I am very disappointed in the CD. I find the vocals to be annoying and irritating and not at all the fun upbeat melodic music we heard while in the Caribbean. The music was repetitious and without any sort of musical creativity and sounding very amateur. I'd recommend looking elsewhere. This CD was a major waste of money."
5,Fascinated by it.,"This DVD set gives you historical context to the bible, and the accompanying DVD on the Martyrs reveals the price believers paid for their faith. Really puts things in perspective. I highly recommend it."
2,Why?!,"Why does David Eddings do this? Meaning, why does he start with a decent ""let's find the blue rock"" story (the Elenium, the Belgariad), and then follow it up with what seems like an exercise in being as farfetched as possible (the Tamuli, the Malloreon)?! He just tries to pull more ideas out and they're just TOO fanciful, even for fantasy. And, of course, all the characters have to deliver their dialogue as one-liners that really aren't that funny. In particular I would LOVE to have Caalador killed off to get rid of that ridiculous dialect (and all the characters who decide to imitate it). And the ending just wasn't that convincing. Stick with the Elenium - the best series Eddings has written, in my opinion. The one-liners are there, but not as many of them, and there are some serious characters to balance the overly witty ones. Plus the story is fantasy, yet not the totally farfetched stuff of the Tamuli."
1,A boring story filled with unfunny characters who won't die.,"This is one of the few fantasy series' I ever read where I really, really wanted the villain to win, but wait the villain here is too boring to even root for. Eee Gad, it the horrible conservative god!! I ended up wishing their little universe would collapse in on itself, killing all those annoying characters and even more annoying pantheon of gods. The repetitive one-liners and sarcastic remarks made by EVERY character are not funny in and only cemented my intense dislike for them. Don't even get me started on the horribly annoying Caalador and his accent. I couldn't even read his dialogue. Is this supposed to be cute? And then to top it off, Eddings rips off his own Belgariad, by having two opposing destinies meet to decide the fate of the universe...blah blah. Please Eddings if you're reading this no more Sparhawk stories!!!"
2,"After finishing this trilogy my first response was ""blah""","As a big fan of Eddings' Belgariad and Elenium I was truly disappointed by what turned out to be a dull repetetive bore.The plot is in a word: STUPID. It can be entertaining enough while you wait for the next Robert Jordan book to finally come out, but on the whole I can not shake the feeling that Eddings is running out of ideas and/or was under heavy pressure from his publisher and had some undergrad English major ghost write this for him."
1,episode six - the boring menace,"I honestly don't know how someone can give this book 5 stars, cause I've read many excellent books, which get 4 stars of something. How can a book like this get 4.5 stars on the average. The characters are the usual: fighter(s), thief,the Mother figure(sephrenia), and bla bla bla bla. The jokes aren't funny, actually, they're an insult to the people of real humour. And in the conversations sometimes I can almost predict what they're gonna say next. All I can say is that the fanatic eddings fans should really think of changing the books they read ---> if they think this book is EXCELLENT... then what about the dark elf trilogy? Dragonlance? Forgotten Realms? All those beat the Elenium and the Tamuli. I liked the Belgariad, those books were good."
5,I want MORE of these characters!,"I've completely fallen in love with these characters, and I want to read MORE about them, I don't care if there's a plot or not, they could sit around a campfire and tell each other jokes (like Star Trek V), just as long as I get to read more about Sparhawk, Sephrenia, Ulath, Talen etc, etc. Please, Mr (and mrs.).Edding, you have to write MORE about these WONDERFUL characters!"
3,big dissapoinment,"hidden city was a big dissapoinment for me.after reading the eleniums and the tamulis, i thought the ending would be something grand, but it's not. it happened too fast. sparhawk confronted cyrgon. and bheliom confronted klael. then finnish. except for zalasta who appeared at sephrenia and vanion's wedding. i was expected more to the way sparhawak confronted azash. anyway, it's a good book."
1,Yawn.,"Why does Eddings bother? His first few books were entertaining in a bubble-gum sort of way, but they kept getting duller and duller. I got this book because I hadn't read his work in a while, and thought maybe I judged it too harshly. I found out I judged it too kindly. The characters are the worst; rather than make people who actually have to struggle and feel pain, he makes a bunch of overpowered idiots who violently massacre anyone in their way, then chuckle at the blood and violence. You never feel that any of the characters are in any danger whatsoever, and it's a pity; most of them would benefit from an arrow in the throat, if you get my meaning."
3,Rather disappointing....,"First time i read it almost four years ago.......and i liked it....loved it, actually..........Unfortunately, i picked it up again two weeks ago decided to read it once more. However, last time when i read this i had not read Jordan or Goodkind, and Eddings seemed the master of fantasy to me. This time i had, and this book showed me how much Eddings really does lack. It is a good series to read while waiting for Jordan or Goodkind to come out with their next book....."
3,Sticky Coaster,"The coaster looks nice, BUT a glass will actually stick to the coaster. I've actually walked half-way across a room and then all of a sudden, without noticing, the glass coaster falls to the floor because it stuck to the glass. I will not be purchasing any glass coasters in the future."
4,Worth The Bang for The Buck,"These coaster look and feel amazing for the price; however, the small rubber feet will fall off sometimes. I do have one coaster with three feet, but it is still sturdy. But hey, I can just replace the whole set for under 10 bucks. So no complaints from me."
4,Looks great,I bought these for some coasters for our new conference room at work. They look sleek and modern and really fit in. I haven't noticed anything about the lack of quality in the build like some of the other reviews have mentioned. I think they are great for the price and would buy them for home if I didn't already have coasters.
2,Pretty yet not very functional,"The color is really pretty, yet the pockets dont fit much in them and I just used it for the first time and one of the zippers has already broke. I would look elsewhere for a travel jewelry bag."
4,Made an excellent gift,"I got this as a Chrismas gift for a friend from her wish list, so she really picked it out. She does a lot of traveling and says that she loves it. The only thing she felt could use improvement was that the necklace pocket only worked for short chains, but that doesn't make her love it any less. If I were still a traveler (those days are behind me), I'd consider one for myself."
3,Average Alien/Werewolf light reading,"What a great eerie premise -- stuck in a strange house battling against aliens and werewolves. What more can you ask from R.L. Stine? However, I really don't recall having much interest while I was reading, regarding most of the plot twists with a shrug and a yawn. I do recall one plotline involving werewolf hunters and you can either join the group or turn into a werewolf and hunt the hunters, which now that I think about was pretty cool. There were some cool scenes with the aliens too, one where the alien spacecraft you're on is in danger of crashing. It's a decent read, but maybe I set myself up for more and was let down when it wasn't as spectacular as it could have been."
5,Rock a bye-bye!,"You had terrible dreams last night. When you wake up, you're not in your room. You're in a creepy old house and you can't remember your name. If you sneak out the window, you'll face the aliens who took away your memory. If you hide, you'll face some werewolves."
5,Heavenly Angels,"Purchased for my wife who collects angels. After waiting for quite awhile since they are usually out of stock, they finally came today. They are beautiful, well crafted, and my wife loves them. Well worth the wait!!!"
3,"Not bad, but not good either.","Okay, in true Marvel form, Spider-Man goes around teaming up or fighting any super-powered person that stumbles through the city. Great concept, not so great product. The Wolverine story is good, and the way they show Spidey sort of looking up to Wolvie is cool. Hulk and Spidey fighting, well what's not to like? Spidey is ridiculously outclassed, as always, but manages to survive a good thrashing. Spidey and Iron Man, well it makes for alot of ""huh?"" and ""what?"" All in all, the first two stories are good, the last is a little lame. My main complaint with the work is the art. Offhand I forget who drew this, but with the quality of the other two Ultimate series, you yould expect more. I give it 1-2 stars for art, but it gets 4 for the first two stories."
2,Bad.,"I was very disappointed with this TPB. The art and writing are both sub par. Especially the Ironman story which looks like it was written by a twelve year old and penciled by his kid brother. Really bad.I think the Ultimate spider-man series is one of the best comics I've seen in years but this doesn't belong on the same shelf. The by-line says Bendis, but I don't believe it for a minute. I've read Bendis, I really like and respect Bendis. This is no Bendis (lol).Seriously, do yourself a favor. Skip this one."
2,"hackneyed, not enough info - needs a rewrite","This is surely a book which was written twenty years ago and has been hastily (and very poorly) updated every few years since. A thorough rewrite, with more detail on more recent models such as the early Turbo Esprits, and more of the ""what to look for when shopping"" info that is the principal reason people buy these Guides, is urgently needed. As written, this book doesn't supply nearly enough info to even identify the 80s Lotuses by year, much less make any sort of intelligent purchasing decision. One of the worst books in this series."
3,Chrome visors,"Because the installation is not as good as it should be, does not fit tightly, could be more user friendly"
1,Defects galore,"I Ordered this cd from amazon. It took 2 months to get to my house. It is defective. the last track does not play, be forewarned this is a manufacturers defect. I am very disappointed not only in the fact I got a defective cd. but also that amazon won't give me a replacement.Precious Time/Get Nervous"
5,EXCELLENT!!!!,If you're looking at this CD.....you are already very familiar with Pats legacy and impact on female rock....so no need to review each track.What you are getting is her 3rd and 4th albums....gloriously remastered like you never heard her before....the sound is strong and clean....the highs just sparkle...alot of effort went into the remastering of these tracks....the liner notes are fantastic...all the lyrics included.You wont be disappointed..guaranteed!!!!
1,Beware! Not remasters!,"If you're looking for a remaster of Get Nervous, this isn't it. It has the same sound as the 1984 Chrysalis release. If you're looking for a remaster of Precious Time, this isn't that either. Get the 2006 Precious Time Remaster here http://www.amazon.com/dp/B000EHRAG6 which is in fact, remastered.As an unashamed Pat Benatar fan, I find it really disappointing that they only remastered her first three albums, In the Heat of the Night, Crimes of Passion and Precious Time. There are some additional remasters on her ""Greatest Hits"" CD http://www.amazon.com/dp/B00094AT4O, but unfortunately, most of them are cut down ""single"" versions and not the uncut album versions. I guess I'm SOOL."
3,A good idea for those tight places.,"Ok, overall I like this product. I'm building a project that has lots of very tight places and this makes it easier to get into some of those places where you need to put a precise hole but just can't get at it with a conventional drill.However, keep in mind that you'll still need to fit this attachment onto a drill and that present some problems. Some drills are too big and cumbersome so if you have an air powered drill or grinding tool then you're ok. You need something thin enough - a hand drill is just too large.The main thing I'd change on the accessory itself would be to put a hex surface on the main shaft at the point it connects to your drill. It has a smooth round surface that just doesn't give a good enough connection sometimes.Other than this, the tools is well priced for what you get and comes with everything I've needed to get into those really tight places where my other 90 degree accessories just won't fit."
2,hohum,"I was looking forward to an active, meaningful discourse on the war between Heaven and Hell for control of existence. I mean, that is what it's all about, isn't it? Instead, I found myself reading a rather stilted, artistically static, lackadasical story which didn't do much to enlighten, or entertain. The annotataions at the end of the book are interesting; but, since they didn't do anything for the story as I read it, weren't that meaningful to me. To be honest, I wasn't impressed. I guess I'm a Tolkien fan and want orcs, goblins, and demons spewing blood. This book just didn't do it for me."
5,CPU Fan,This fan is quiet and has dropped my CPU temp by 10 degrees. Was easy to install and looks good in my see-through tower case.
5,"Easy, Fast, Simple, Cheap and Excellent","I have set up a number of linksys systems. It is my preferred network for home and small business. I really liked this portable adapter. Some of the reviews were not great, but I found it very easy, fast and simple to install. The connection is excellent. We are using these in a small business covering three buildings on a 3 acre property. These adapters are connecting through a linksys range extender in one building to the router in a building approximately 50 yards away. We are having no problems. Can easily recommend, especially for $25. One negative. Bought two through Amazon/Tiger Direct. If I had waited two weeks, I could have avoided shipping through amazon alone."
2,Sort of works but has issues,"I am using this device on 5 dell gx270 computers right next to each other connecting to a Linksys Wrt54g router within 20 feet of them. We bought these devices to replace similar 802.11b devices. It shows excellent signal strength but a connection speed of 1mbps! I am using the most recent firmware and drivers on all devices. I also have 2 other Dell computers right next to these using the Dell wireless cards ordered with them and they show a connecting speed of 54 MBPS. I did a speed test and the ones using the Linksys WUSB54GP show actually running about half the speed of the Dell 54g devices. Trying different channels did not help. If you have a similar setup, I do not recommend these.Another issue is the orentation of these devices when inserted in the USB connection without using the stand. You cannot twist it in all directions to enable it to fit flush with the machine."
4,Good until an upgrade,"This product I got to hook up a dell pc for wireless internet. Item worked great for over a year until a few days ago I decided to upgrade my Linksys WRT54GP2A-AT router to an Apple Airport Extreme (gigabit) router.For some reason this usb wireless adapter refused to see the airport base station. I looked on the net to see if anyone had the same problem that I was having, but did not find any. There were no updates on the Linksys site nor a list of compatible routers that this will work with.So for those who have this same setup ... heads up!I am purchasing another usb wireless adapter, hopefully I will have some better luck."
1,"Disjointed, confusing film","I feel a little flimflammed having just purchased this film. I'm a huge Mozart fan and thought this might be an interesting variant on Mozart's wonderful Magic Flute.I'm still trying to figure out what the director was attempting to accomplish. It's a confusing, incomprehensible mishmash of poor acting and chopped up opera.Warren Christie would be a sensation in a high school play, but he's awful as Tom/Tamino. The only decent actor is the Monostatos character.DO NOT waste your hard-earned cash on this disaster."
4,Great stories.,"Although there were a few changes from the books, the movies were interesting, touching & educational. The price was a great value & they're movies all ages can enjoy even without reading the books first."
5,Great Movies For The Whole Family,I bought these for my 12-year-old daughter. She absolutely loves them and I enjoy watching them as well. Each story has a good moral message and there is nothing inappropriate that you wouldn't want to see/hear. My daughters watch these over and over again. A very good investment!
5,Excellent,The American Girl Doll movies are great for the family. We never have to worry about vulgarity or anything inappropriate. They are interesting and enjoyable. My hat is off to the producers. I hope they make more. Take care.
4,Happy granddaughter,Extremely prompt service- everything was totally as promise.American Girl Three-Pack (Felicity - An American Girl Adventure / Molly - An American Girl on the Home Front / Samantha - An American Girl Holiday)Very pleased with product and seller.
5,Great family movies!,My 7 year old daughter received these as a Christmas gift and loves them. The stories are very good with a redeeming message and good historical content. Both my son and daughter stayed interested in the story and asked questions related to the story and history. We love these movies!
5,Awesome historical movies,"I received it the date as expected, it comes a little bend, not to worry. My 10 year old daughter loved it. Also my big son too. We enjoyed it watching all together as a family. Good production, great actors, the history behind the movies great."
5,"Wonderful, wholesome movies","Got these movies for our six year old daughter. All three are nice, wholesome movies that all the girls who visit our home love. We have watched them over and over for the past 2 years and watch one of them at least once a month. The whole history based concept of the books and movies from American Girl has given our daughter an education that the school won't give her until middle school. Definitely recommend these!"
5,Wonderful,We love american girl. We have seen these movies on TV and have read the books too. They teach about life lessons for young girls in such an easy way. It is a great example for these young girls today.THey are wonderful stories and my 7 yr old daughter loves it. This is the perfect Christmas gift for her. She will be so excited and I expect we will watch these movies over and over again.
4,well told stories,"My daughter absolutely loves all things American Girl. These movies are well done- good production value, known actors etc. The one thing I will say is that each of them has some parts that are sad and suspenseful, and some of my daughter's more sensitive friends were upset by them. They all have happy endings, but if your child is easily upset or saddened I'd preview before you let them watch."
5,American Girl Movie Collection,My daughter and I thoroughly enjoy watching these over and over! Great price- way less than purchasing at a bookstore in town!!
5,Wonderful,My daughter enjoyed the movies. It's great to have all three movies together. Great value.
5,American Girl Movie Pack,"This was an awesome purchase! My eight year old daughter does not want to watch anything other than the American Girl movies now. She especially likes the ""Molly movie"", as she calls it. I would highly recommend this movie pack!"
4,Really special,"Finally the Monkees first season is on DVD and I'm thrilled. I didn't see the show until they were reruns in the early 70's but absolutely fell in love with the show. The Monkees and Batman were my favorite 60's TV shows. Everything is awesome about the set but I agree with other reviewers that the 5.1 sound isn't that great. I still use it because it seems more complete to me but you can be the judge. Definitely don't let that deter you from buying this. I also wish that there would be a Play All feature but oh well. And each time you choose an episode, you have to decide in 2.0 or 5.1. Just little nick picks if you're wanting to watch many. This is well worth it and the convenient small box should be the wave of the future for box sets."
3,Why not captioned or english subtitled ????,"It doesn't make sense such package with several ""extras"" but no caption or english subtitles."
4,Monkees Season 1,Always loved the Monkees. Watching season one makes me feel young again. One of the dvds is messed up and I cannot watch two of the episode on that dvd.
4,A blast from the past...and more!,"Enjoyed the DVD set very much. Although certain episodes had audio problems, it was still good enough to watch. The concert tour footage was great...got to see the whole group as a ""real"" band. Would highly recommend this set for any Monkees fan."
2,"NO Digital Enhancement, but very much needed.","Be warned that these are NOT digitally enhanced, and it shows. The audio and video seem very old and worn-out."
3,"Great Boxset, but....","It is indeed a great boxset. No doubt this is what we've waiting for ages, but time passes and my hearing is not that accurate anymore, I wonder why Rhino didn't bother to put captions? I know, it's kind irrelevant in music dvds to have captions, but it would have been nice to be able to understand 100% of what they're saying....or maybe it's my boxset that is defective? I would give 5 stars, but take out 2 stars for the lack of captions."
3,How does it compare to the earlier release?,"This is not a review. It is a question that has not been answered by the other reviews and product information. I bought seasons one and two when they were released in the early 2000s. These are the sets that look like little turntables and have six sleeves like 45rpm covers. One thing that irritated me about that release was that there was no ""play all"" selection. It's not that it's too much work to play each episode individually but I like the marathon option, one show leading flawlessly into the next. It seems to me that to reissue this series it wouldn't take much to add that feature. Can anyone tell me if this has been done?"
5,awesome-great memories!,"I have been waiting for years, since tv shows have been coming out on dvd but never saw this anywhere! Thrilled to find it in Blowitouttahere.com!"
2,Why?,"It took me FOREVER to get my order. I ordered DVDs, they don't work.... But I did get what I ordered, new-looking and it was pretty cheap. But once I put them in the DVD player I found out why... It's a bit dissapointing and I hope to get them working soon it just sucks that I have to go through alot to get them working :( it could have been better but I guess I could say it could have been worse too..."
3,Why so expensive??,"I was so happy to see The Monkees was being re-released on DVD and was thinking about buying them (I missed out on the original Rhino release). $63 for each season??? Really? That just seems a little much. I am a hardcore fan, but I just can't see paying so much for these sets. Bring them down to a more reasonable price (closer to $30 per season) and we'll talk.This just seems like gouging to me."
4,Has this edition closed captions or English subtitles ?,"This is not a review , only a doubt I would like to solve : has this new edition english subtitles or closed captions ? Can anybody answer this question ? I am waiting for it."
5,I am really happy,"I am so glad that this is finally coming to DVD!!!! It is the best show ever made, and I am just so excited to get this! I hope they come out with Season 2 also!"
1,Save your money..,"I was disappointed to see the prints so faded and dirty on this DVD reissue... The prints had dirt and the quality of the prints is far below for what I expect in a DVD release. Not all the extras in the world would make me buy another set like this again... They need to find the masters, clean them, and get them remastered... The Monkees should have gotten a better re issue then what it got... There were also typos on the some of the extra material as well.. The guys should have gotten a better reissue then what it got.. I might send mine back...."
4,Great Flashback !!,"I used to watch these shows after school at 5 o'clock in the afternoon, back in...yes, 1979. So they were . duh, in syndication reruns, but for my generation, my first chance to see ""The Monkees.""I looked forward to it everyday.This box set, as well as season 2 are great. Sure, the audio is sub par, but it's the way it aired, then. Cleaned up some, and in it's original form. No edits and all the BS 60's promo's. How cool is that??Stop the bitchin' and be thankful we can accually get these shows on a full DVD set.Original packaging, very cool idea, not easy to fit into my DVD set up, but, that's what makes in unique.Thanks Rhino !!"
3,"Nice contents, shame about the transfer ...","Just to point out that the picture suffers from what (to me at least) is the worse kind of DVD picture defect. It's the kind where, in order to save space on the disc, stills are used as backgrounds giving the picture a wholly artificial look. For sure, a lot of people won't be bothered by any of these flaws. But it's clear how the picture has been taken apart and put together again by the way moving objects (e.g. someone walking across a room) look superimposed on the background. Objects with sharp edges look as though they've been 'cut & pasted' onto the picture, reminiscent of a bad computer game. Tell-tale 'difficult' shots, such as trees and ocean scenes, are particularly poorly handled."
5,Amazing zany improv,"The Monkees are truly talented who actually had a chance to play their own music. They are multi-talented, funny, and the best entertainers in the world."
1,ARE YOU KIDDING ME???,"I paid good money for what I THOUGHT would be the ORIGINAL discs from a place called ""Monkee Time"",and I got jipped!!!They were nothing but COPIES of the discs,including the case,and played RATHER POORLY!!!I suggest that EVERYBODY watchs where they get their ""used"" DVD's from,because if it's ""Monkee Time"",they DO MONKEY around!!!"
3,"Not ""a must have"" book","I have bought this book for my teaching purposes targeting a ""new starter"" group. Introductory chapters are good. It has abundant representative pictures. But as the topics progres the book becomes having a little problematic. If you think to buy this book as a self study guide, it is maybe better to look for another one.On the other hand, SQL Server Express Edition does not have so much book-style resources. This may force the reader to buy this book (as in my case!)But as a last opinion, this book is not a ""must have book"""
1,I was mega-disappointed.,"After reading the two reviews, I thought this would be a great introduction to furniture design. I was expecting information such as generally accepted proportions of furniture elements, possibly a discussion of the application of the golden rectangle, and other non-obvious thoughts. The information is very high-level and broad. This book is so light on real information that I consider it useless."
1,disappointed,"I expected information about design, but this is just a self serving ""I am good at what I do"" book. I am sure he is good but there is little or no information about how to actually desigh furniture. No proportions, no instruction except make your mistakes on paper by sketching first. A waste of good money."
1,Not the updated twist,"I was disappointed to find that this is the older version. Look for ""3rd Generation"" if you want the one that has the curved side that fits well in your hand, and makes it easier to crush cloves to get the skin off."
3,OK but far from perfect,"For ~$18, I would have expected this to be a terrific help in the kitchen. After all, I was told this was one of the hottest gadgets around. But, I am sorry to say that I was not entirely satisfied. First, I use only organic garlic and it's not cheap. This tool minces most of the clove, but not all of it (similar to a garlic press). So if you don't want to be wasteful, you have to fish out the remaining bits and pieces with a toothpick and then chop them by hand. Next, for those of us with small hands, it's a chore to get the tool moving enough to result in any meaningful action. So in the end, I went back to doing what I was doing before... that is, buying pre-peeled, organic garlic cloves from Whole Foods - no waste at all and instantly available to cook with. And if it needs to be minced, I whip out my Pampered Chef hand chopper and go to town."
3,garlic twist,"Pros:Nice, heavy-weight construction.Easy to clean. Just rinse under running water or place in top shelf of dishwasher.Makes nice, uniform mince.Cons:Mincing large cloves kind of hard on the hands. Helps to cut them in half.Somewhat picky getting the minced garlic out. I use a spoon."
3,Garlic Twister,"Bought this as a gift because we'd been given a similar one - with metal blades - that we love. Didn't realize until it arrived that this has plastic ""blades"". This one doesn't cut the garlic quite as easily as the metal blades, and certainly doesn't leave it in neat little triangles like the illustration suggests (who cares?), but it works just fine. Lack of metal blades might be a plus in a household with small children. Washes up fine in the dishwasher."
5,Use it Daily,"I use this nifty little tool every day. It keeps your hands free of the garliky smell, and minces garlic to a fine paste for maximum flavor. And isn't that the point?"
5,I hate garlic presses.,"What more can I say. I've always been bothered by garlic presses, they never seem to do a good job, and you lose a lot of flavor since the juices are squeezed out and then you wind up with a bunch of pulp stuck in the press that you can't get out.Anyway, this thing is great. Whack the garlic with it (it has a nice heft to it), pop in the garlic, twist and toss it is a pan of olive oil. Best garlic device I've ever used."
2,Great little wrist strengthener,"It's all plastic--no metal blades. Plastic is not the ideal for a slicing device. A large clove of garlic needs to be cut into 6-8 pieces and do only 2 cloves at a time. Even then, twisting this thing to mash the garlic (it does not chop or dice) is a physical challenge. (OK, I'm over 60, but I can still lift a glass of wine!) I really don't see this device as part of my cooking routine, there are much easier ways to get pressed-equivalent garlic (like in a garlic press). The one upside is that it is very easy to clean, compared to a garlic press."
2,Not easy to use.,"Don't let the picture fool you. When you are done crushing the garlic it is all over the inside of the device and very difficult to get out. It seems as if you are wasting a lot of garlic that you don't get out. If you attempt to crush more than one clove at a time it is very hard to get started. Also, your fingers will fall off if you have to get a lot of crushed garlic. This is only good for a small amount, but then again, you have to crush 4 cloves to get a useable amount of 2. There are better options out there."
4,"Not as Easy to Use as Touted, but...","It beats having garlic smell on your fingers. It's a bit difficult to turn - and metal blades might be better, as they could be sharper, but this does the job if you don't want finely minced garlic - but more of a crushed minced.I bought several to give as gifts, but wouldn't buy more to give away. A bit pricey for what it does."
1,bad experience,"I had a bad experience with this company (Buzz Electronics US. They send the wrong items, and after submitting a return request, it was never followed up on."
3,Great Concept; Mediocre Product,"I decided to try a new type of garlic mincer/press. My old squeeze press came apart and it was time to get a new one. The concept of the twist and mince garlic press is really great; unfortunately, it is hard to fit the garlic cloves into the Garlic Twist. I had to start mincing the garlic with the cap still loose, while pressing down until it finally fell into place. Perhaps I didn't cut up the cloves enough - I will continue to experiment with the Garlic Twist and see if I can master it eventually! I'm a huge garlic fan and use garlic a lot in my day-to-day cooking, so a good quality garlic press is essential for me. I would recommend this product if you're willing to cut the cloves of garlic into smaller pieces before you put them in the Garlic Twist. Three stars for being ""okay."""
3,I only liked this until I found something much better,"This is an easy to use, elegantly designed device, alas it is a pain to clean. It's also hard to get all the garlic out of it, which makes it wasteful. As long as you don't mind minced garlic going down the drain, you can get it out with a sprayer on your sink. I've tried many different knives to tease the garlic out from between the teeth, and never had much success.Then I decided, for the whimsy factor, to get the Garlic Zoom. It's a much better product and far easier to clean. Also, it's pretty easy to get almost all of the garlic out of the zoom without it going down the drain. That makes it a superior product in my book."
1,An inferior product,"This small piece of cheap plastic borders on useless. It is far too small to fit more than a few petite cloves and it is way to small to handle even a single medium sized one. The ""blades"" are dull plastic nubs and really just mush up the garlic into a stringy mess.After trying out five different garlic choppers, I have found one that is clearly the best:http://amzn.com/B000IL4FN4"
3,Hard to get the garlic out,"This minces garlic very well if the cloves aren't too large and you don't press down too hard while twisting. However, I always find bits of garlic get stuck and I have to dig them out with a fork or my fingers. I still prefer using this over a knife, though, especially if you have to mince several cloves for one recipe."
3,Adding to the Mrs karaoke,"Well, this one is not as good as the 90's. We all still loved it, but thought the song selection was lacking. I guess it was to expensive to pay royalties for more ""Pop"" songs. Still a GREAT game!"
4,"Good gameplay, but depends on your music preferences","I purchased this game for my wife, as she loves SingStar '80s and Singstar '90s. This edition of the game has all the same gameplay options, and is basically identical, save for the music selections. In this version, there's much more contemporary stuff which we weren't as familiar with. While it is still well done, I believe that much of the entertainment factor is rocking along to your favorite songs. As there were a handful of songs on this one we really liked, it wasn't as compelling as the other editions to us. But to those who ""grew up"" with more of the music in this set, it will be a great buy!"
3,My daughter LOVES this game!,Obviously my daughter loves this game...I have to tell her to turn it down when she and her friends are playing it... which is all the time.
4,Lots of Fun,"To start with, this game is a lot of fun. I can't rate this a 5. When you do the duet, you sing together and not as a duet. I guess since I sing Karaoke a duet is when two ppl sing together, but have solos. Anyhow, I do give it a 4 since this game does have a lot of fun songs. I have never been able to get my husband to do karaoke not even at home, but since we got this game and all of the other singstars, I can't get my husband to quit. lol It's great.. He actually gets into it and sings. My daughter who is almost 7 loves to get in and sing as well. I would definately recomend this game to anyone. But keep in mind, it's not like karaoke.. The Karaoke mode still has the singers in the background, but still fun non the less.."
3,It's no KR,"This game was ok, but not worth the money. The songs are more up-to-date and cool, but the overall fun of the game isnt as good as karaoke revolution. There are no ""extras"" or really even goals to try to achieve. Also, you have to use the special ""singstar"" microphones."
1,DO ORDER FROM HERE!,"The game never got to my house and trying to contact someone about it was impossible go to another buyer!! i cant tell you how good the game is cause i dont have ,n yeah im bitter, somewhere out there some people are playing this and having a blast i shouldnve just gone to best buy."
3,not quite Sallis or Mosely,"Aaron Gunner is a streetwise private eye working out of an office in Mickey Moore's Barber Shop in Los Angeles. He's already working for Connie Everson who wants him to find out who her City Councilman husband is having an affair with--she already knows about his white woman, but fears she has a black rival. Now, he's also hired to find Yolanda McCreary's brother, Elroy Covington. Elroy never returned home from the Million Man March. When last seen, he was in LA at the Stage Door Hotel and he had Gunner's card in his room.Looking for Elroy leads Gunner to Barber Jack Frerotte, a notorious razor blade wielding psychopath and then to the Defenders of the Bloodline, who are dedicated to ridding the African-American community of ""Uncle Toms"".As always, Haywood is stronger on setting, character & dialogue than on the actual mechanics of the mystery. While he doesn't measure up to James Sallis or Walter Mosely, it's still a fun series.GRADE: C"
4,Losses Not Covered,"This book was very interesting and held some useful information. However, a large amount of the lessons and information pertained to the authors' personal stories and the issues dealing with marital partners, former and present. I would have liked to had a little more information on dealing with the losses of parents, siblings, friends, etc., with whom people have a bad relationship and how the survivors deal with those losses. But I do recommend the book if for no other reason than it says out loud what many people are afraid to say - that often times death is a relief to those left behind."
3,Grt for the paint mostly if you wash at the perfect times only!,The job on the windows and tires far from impressed me. I use vingar multi surface cleaner for the windows and more specific wheel cleaners and protectors. If you don't wash your car at the perfect time of day and or location then water spots likely will occur and other reviews say that in the cleaning kit reviews also. Weather can also be a factor in the timing of cleaning too. But other then that you can see my kit review or filter one.
5,I get it now!,"A fantastic, thorough and intriguing look at why we like the things we like and how taste is developed among social groups. While contemporary critics are beginning to move away from the high/low brow distinctions that Bourdieu created in this masterful study based on thousands of surveys, this text is very important to the development of cultural studies and the concept of cultural capital."
2,For the insomniac or the insane...,"Horrible book. The author is very descriptive but to the point where she loses your interest. And it makes you wonder, when the characters go to Africa, if the author had ever been to Africa. The first few chapters and you're already asleep!"
5,Soft and cudly,"It was a hit. My daugher loves tigers and stuffed animals, so I could hardly go wrong with this one. Nice quality, soft and cudly. :)"
5,Beautiful stuffed tiger,"This stuffed tiger is very well built, very soft and adorable. My daughter fell in love with it. I highly recommend it."
4,"Like the airline, undelivered potential","Aviacsa was a Mexican airline that has been shut down by the Mexican government for safety reasons. We get a multiflight DVD in two aircraft 727s and old school 737-200s. The flying sequences are all good. The cockpit explanations are fair, you can do better by buying Cougar or AeroGal for these models. Much of the cockpit chatter and ATC chatter is in Spanish, which will complicate things if you don't speak the language. Visually an excellent and enjoyable presentation, not as technically interesting as most Just Planes offerings."
2,Not fair on non-physicist mathematicians,"Couldn't get into this, I gave up in the first chapter after failing to understand how he was applying his Kronecker product to his vectors. He just failed to explain his notation adequately. *And* there were mistakes in that first bit I read up to then.I appreciate that physicists and mathematicians use different language, and I also appreciate that this was an advanced work, i.e. postgrad plus, but it would have been nice to have seen a glossary of terms and a little more background.This may be a competent and erudite work, but unfortunately impenetrable without unspecified previous knowledge, and that's not the way these books ought to be."
1,Beware the plants (i.e. the first two reviews)!!!!,"By far, the worst book of the Jason X series. Hell, it may even be one the worst books ever published. It's hard to put into words how incoherent this book actually is (but I'll try anyway). If you strung random words and phrases together in sentences, the end result would sound like a typical passage from Jason X: Death Moon. Go ahead, try it. Yes, it's that bad. So, in conclusion, if you enjoy incoherent prose, piss-poor attempts at ""cyberpunk"" imagery, and a general sense of being ripped-off, then this is the book for you."
3,Elsa Lancaster and,"Overall, I liked this one. The thing I didn't like was all the references combining ancient civilizations with modern computer terms, like ""Mayan cryptoglyphics"" or ""fractal Aztec codes"". I don't know if those two are in there, but you get the idea. And there was one segment that went on and on about Elsa Lancaster. She played the title character in ""Bride of Frankenstein"". That section just confused me."
4,Good value - lots of mini-figures (droids) for the price,"My 8-year old gets a lot of mileage out of this pack of drois.For the price as compared to other lego packs with individualmini-figures, it is a good deal. I rated low durability becauseit seems to me that the parts may wear and not connect over timebut I have not evidence of such as yet."
5,Lincoln Industrial Grease Gun,"I have lots of equipment that must be greased on a yearly basis and I need a grease gun that will handle all the equipment regardless of sise or pressure requirements. I needed one with a flexible hose to get into those tight spaces too.I use mainly lithium all purpose grease cartridges in this thing and these are really easy to install too. Once the catridge is installed and ready to go, all I got to do is put the coupler end onto the grease zerk and pump three times for each grease zerk, thats it! This thing holds so much grease that you will be greasing till the cows come home before you run out!The things I like most about this grease gun are its durability, pressure capacity, grease capacity, flexible hose, and its got a cover for the tip of the coupler so that you don't contaminate the grease. This is a must have tool if you value your equipments life and don't want to deal with siesed bearings, spindles, etc... I have had no problems with the gun at all. 5 Stars!"
4,does the job.,you have to be a little careful when you take the end of the gun off the fitting. there is a small seam that must be lined up with the zerk to get it off easily. so far has worked well.
5,Lincoln Lubrication 1133,Well built solid unit that works as it should.Solid cast head with good heavy tube. Nice cleanly machined threads on both tube and head.Latching the follower fully extended for charging is a snap and it actually stays latched. Releasing it after the housing is re-assembled is easy as well. After some of the cheapies I've used this one is almost a pleasure to charge. More importantly after almost a year sitting mostly charged it doesn't leak grease everywhere.I bought it for the pistol grip pump to keep my second hand free to keep the fitting latched. However. The fitting firmly latches onto grease Zerks. It takes an authoritative pull to release making the pistol pump almost window dressing. Grease actually goes through the Zerk not in a pile on the garage floor. It doesn't take 5 hands to use a right angle or needle adapter they stay attached till you remove them.The storage cap is a nice touch to keep crud out of the fitting.
3,grease gun,"hard to load grease tube finally had to take what grease was left in tube and put in grease gun by hand , after i had it all over me !!"
4,my review,"I purchased this unit with a future usage anticipated and have yet to use... so this review will be about the unit itself, not how well it works. The grease gun appears to be well built, very sturdy construction and heavy. My only wish was it came 'fully charged' with grease, but that is not what was advertised so I received what was advertised. Will use it and maybe change my 4 star rating..."
2,Buy the Car Kit Instead,"The home docking station cuts off the FM tuner capability enough to render that feature useless to transmit to other FM radios in the house. For the same dollar amount, buy the car kit, (I bought a 2nd, and will buy a third). The cradle on the car kit sits in a flat surface just as well as the home unit. If I would have known then, I wouldn't have bought the Home Kit..... P.S. I wrote a similar review on Kenwoods' Website.. Hope this helps..........Amps: Eureka, California........."
5,Absurdities & Realities of Special Education:,"This is an accurate and humorous look at the education system, especially special eduaction."
1,These are NOT volleyball line judge flags!,"If you are a volleyball official that is looking to buy flags for line judges, don't buy these.Volleyball flags should be a single solid color."
2,Cover art is the best thing about this item,"This is black and white cartoons of fairly crude, graphic sex. The stories are moderately interesting at times. The art work is medium quality comic style cartoons. The quality of the cover art does not reflect the graphics inside. I was disappointed overall."
1,AWFUL,"This movie was AWFUL AWFUL AWFUL. It did not finish the story from the original series. It was basically about a Jewish girl and Hub. If you want to watch this I would recommend ordering it from the library, not wasting money purchasing it. How sad that such an amazing series was cancelled and we are left with this crappy movie to try and tie up loose ends."
3,Good Christmas special,"I was hoping for more closure from this series, but there wasn't much. The story was good and we enjoyed watching it, but we missed having the closed captioning that we had when watching the series."
5,"""Contraceptive Technology"" review","I have checked this book out of the Seattle Public Library so many times that I'm considering buying it for my personal reference library. I have recommended this book to many men and women. Excellent information (and things you did not expect to read) about differernt methods of birth control. If you want to be informed and educated about oral contraceptives, abortion and gynecology then you will find this book helpful."
3,"Still good, but in bad need of updating","Contraceptive Technology is perhaps the best book available for understanding and using contraception. It should be in the office of every gynecologist, family physician and nurse practitioner and family planning clinic. The book explains complicated concepts in accurate, but easy to understand language.But it has not been updated since 1998 and it is now somewhat out-of-date. Most of the information in the book is still solid, but since publication, new technologies and understandings have occurred and these new data make it imperative that a new edition be issued before this book can maintain its role as the ""bible"" on reproductive health and technology."
3,I think it was real,"Most of the poems i read are almost fake , stevens poems were real at heart he had alot of topics that made you think a little i think that alot of people can learn from his poetry."
5,Rainsuit for gardening,"I'm quite pleased with this rain suit. We have had a windy, rainy spring here in Colorado, and this suit has allowed me to continuing gardening no matter what the weather is doing. It was an exceptional bargain for the $13.49 I paid, and better quality than I would have expected.I am a size 8 to 10 is women's clothing and bought the medium. The sleeves and pants are just slightly long, but the roominess gives me ease of movement. There is nowhere for any rain to get in, even in heavy, windy rain. There are snaps to tighten the sleeve and pants ends, and a string to tighten the hood.It even occurred to me that this would make decent foul weather gear for sailing, where really heavy duty waterproof suits can be necessary in a good nor' easter. I had hoped the fabric would be a little lighter weight, but what you give up in weight you also give up in water proof ability and long term durability."
4,Good Choice,"This replaces a similar rain suit that I had for many years. I use it for fishing and it provides adequate protection from the rain with the ease of movement for casting etc. It is not a substitute for heavy duty protection requirements, but is perfect for most weather-related situations."
1,Very poor quality.,I bicycle alot and this product can't handle you moving your legs the way you do when your bicycling and it ripped at the seam in the crotch putting it on for the first time and then it became far worse when I started peddling. I can't say I would buy this again since it is of such shoddy quality.
1,Sizes stink,I bought this for my boyfriend who has a 30 inch waist and they blow out when he tried them on. He never even got to wear them in the rain The worst part is I ended up giving him the set I bought for my self which were larger but now I don't get one and I will not order another because I shouldn't have to pay shipping when the origional product is weak and 3 sizes to small I was very dissapointed.
2,WAY UNDERSIZED!!!!!,"This suit would be a great value if the size were true.I ordered a 4x and it was about the size of a 2x. length would of worked, but the jacket was super tight in the back, shoulders and pit area. Overalls would not go well over any cloths really. Honestly the material seemed to be stout and overall the suit was of good quality, just WAY undersized."
3,Pockets tore easily,This is a nice item and will do the job for most people for random use. I found that the front pockets tore very easy and as such they are of no value. OK...but not for rugged use.
3,Not very good!,"For the price it serves its purpose, runs very small' order at least 3-4 sizes larger."
3,"Starts great, then commits suicide","An engrossing and exciting adventure. I bought it hoping for interesting time travel paradoxes, such as I enjoyed in his short story ""All You Zombies,"" and his novel ""The Door to Summer."" But ""Door"" is much simpler, and ""Zombies"" is short enough so you only go crazy a short time trying to make sense of impossibilities. Here Heinlein brings in dozens of new and unnecessary characters in the last third, and unfortunately, they all have the same personality, wisecracking egomaniacs. You can't tell them apart. Worth reading, but if you want a Heinlein book that satisfies to the very end, try The Door to Summer."
1,Worst book I've ever read,"I could not finish this book. In fact this is the only fiction novel I have ever not finished. I've read hundreds. It does start off interesting as other have said, but everything from the prose to the plot falls apart during the middle.The banter with the main characters wife gets very old... Il just stop here and say I agree with every criticism writen before my ""review"" and would not recomend this book to my enemies."
3,Incredible start followed by literary suicide,"The early to middle portions of Heinlein's novel were extremely entertaining with unbelieveably comical dialog. I even managed to be charmed by the more than somewhat confusing plot and blatant sloshing about of intentionally incomprehensible technology. The self-terminating mistake? A horrific cut and paste ending that was more closely resembling of the eratic ""art"" of an easily bored two year-old suffering from ADHD than a fitting end to a fantastic literary journey."
3,Well . . .,"If I were you, I'd read only the first half of this book. It's really clever. The characters are likeable, there's humor, what more can a guy ask for? But then, just about halfway through the book, it starts to get confusing. What is the significance of the stupid cat? You never find out. Not really. He dedicates like one sentence to the topic. In the last half the story just seems to fall apart. The first half is sort of like a mystery. They are trying to figure out something--but I don't remember what, that should tell you something. But I do remember this cute little poem from the first half of the book: When in danger or in doubt run in circles, scream and shout."
1,Not good value,Robert Heinlein has written lots of very good books. I have read all of them. This is simply not one of them. It's value is to provide data on his decline as an author. His last few books are simply not good value (except to his bank account.
2,Puhhlease,"I've been a big Heinlein fan for over 30 years so what a huge disappointment. The writing was so smug and self-serving, at times I almost choked. Not everyone can be Nelson DeMille. This train wreck makes me appreciate his writing style all the more."
1,Not one of Heinlein's best,"I am a fan of Heinlein's books and normally have nothing but praise for his writing as well as his expressed philosophy. ""The Moon Is A Harsh Mistress"" and ""Starship Troopers"" are perfect examples of what I mean, both in style as well as philosophy. ""Cat"" starts out well enough, promising to be a sequel to ""Moon"" in style and storyline. But then Heinlein goes astray. His dialog tends to get lost in meaningless, erudite chatter that does nothing but camouflage the action. The plot has many loose ends that are never explained or tied into the story. The motivation of his characters is weak or non-existent and he gets lost in his late-years philosophy of ""free sex with everyone and shame for none"". By the end of the book, I was asking myself why I had read it - or at least finished it. I was very disappointed."
1,Grandmaster produces rotten step-child,"Stranger in a Strange Land was one of the best books I have ever read, so I was eager to try another Heinlein book. To compare that novel with The Cat Who Walks Through Walls, would be like comparing the movie Taxi Driver to a bad made for tv special. I was offended at the dialog. I don't have anything against an author's predisposition with giving all the women spankings, or talking about their ""crinkled areolas"", but the delivery of all the protagonist's dialog was trite and unnatural. The first half of the book moves along nicely. Lot's of adventure and near scrapes from antagonists abound. Then confusion sets in. The numerous aliases used by several characters, combined with a derailed plot, totally jumps the shark midway through. I was dismayed when finishing the book, and checked the reviews on Amazon to see if there wasn't something wrong with me. Apparently, I am not the only one disappointed."
3,Not Heinlein's Best...,"While somewhat a self-indulgent book, Heinlein still maintains a firm grip on natural, witty dialogue and intelligent prose. Heinlein never takes his stories too seriously...infact his plots are almost entirely absurd entities couched inside some hard sci-fi and serious philosophy. Mock allegorical perhaps? I agree, that there is not much to this tale once the last page is turned, but it's a fun ride down Heinlein's thematic career. As a huge fan, it looks like an homage to all his earlier works. Definitely not a Heinlein starter, but well above the quality of the pulps he started his career with."
3,Read this some time ago,It's been a while since I read this one. One thing that stands out for me is the disappointment at the ending. I felt like the author got tired of writing and took the easy way out.
2,Just a soap opera.,"If you like science fiction, then this probably isn't the book for you. Basically the entire length of this book consists of the witty dialogue that the characters partake in. There are a FEW good sci-fi ideas, but nothing actually happens in the book."
3,What?...,"Don't get me wrong I love Heinlein, but I couldn't finish this book. No writer excites and aggravates me as much as this man. His works are brilliance bordering insane drivel. This book starts off as a fast paced romp through spacebut breaks down somewhere in the middle, by 3/4 of the way through I was totally lost, plot twists started to entangle and bumb headlong into themsleves. I stuck this back on my shelf and read 'Friday' instead. I think if Heinlein suffered from thing it was not knowing when to stop or starting a storry to early when it should have started in the middle of the book (if you get my meaning). I found out later that this is part of a series, so maybe if I read it in order it'll make more sense."
1,"I am looking an ebook, not an audio book.","My search criteria does mention audio book or audible.com and yet I am being given ""recommendation"" for an Audible.com product.I want to READ Heinlein, not listen to him. How do I block all offerings of audio books and mention of Audible.com."
1,Put the book in Kindle format.,"You know, I enjoy reading. I do NOT enjoy being read to, because I am not two years old any more. I'm sure this audio book is probably great for people who enjoy that sort of thing, and Heinlein is a fantastic author (although if you are new to him I certainly wouldn't start with this book). What I want is the printed word in a readable electronic format. Are you listening, Kindle people? I don't enjoy being read to and I will not buy this audio book to play on my Kindle device. If you are producing audio books instead of electronic print books to get me to spend more money, I'm here to tell you it isn't going to work! Print the damn book in a Kindle format and I will buy it."
1,"Shocking to the reader,","I am a great lover of the words of Heinlein. But this book has got to be one of his worst. While it has some very interesting quantum physics threads, and some interesting character as aware entity moments, it does not hold together. The relationships of the main character and his children (near the end of the book) are confusing and more explicit than needed/wanted. The 'mysteries' the main character was trying to solve fell apart like wet tissue paper. I was dissapointed that the ending did not allow resolution of many issues the book tried to explore. What was heinlein thinking?"
2,Heinlein the ideologue overwhelms Heinlein the storyteller,"This book shares much in common with ""Number of the Beast"". Both begin with the hero pursued by unidentified nasties. He quickly acquires a loving but mysterious wife, then runs for his life for a couple of hundred pages, with you turning pages quickly to see how it turns out. Then it gets weird.Heinlein's love late in his life of multipersonality soliphism (we made the universe up between us.) overwhelms the story and plot, characterization, and everything else just dissolve. Lots of potential wasted."
5,It Grew on Me Over Time,"I read this book two years ago and I didn't like it at all. Oh, the first half of the book was an excellent adolescent chase on a space station and across the moon. However, the second half was more of a... I really can't describe it without giving away the plot. ... And the ending? Well, I simply didn't like it one bit.Two years ago I didn't like it because I wanted a simple, happy adventure story. I didn't want to have to deal with the implications of the second half of the book. Since then, I've read, and *forgotten* a lot of easy adventure books. Yet this book has always stayed in my mind. I haven't yet read many of Heinlein's works, but now I'm going to start. And the ending? You'll never forget it!"
3,Half of a very good book.,"The first half of this book is vintage Heinlein. This isprobably because the first half was written twenty yearsbefore the second half. The latter half of the book isreminiscent of Heinlein's ""Number of the Beast"", and isalmost as poorly written.Recommended only for someone who wants to read _every_Heinlein novel."
3,Falls off at the end,"First two-thirds a 9, last third a 3, average out to a six...this book is similar to the series ""Twin Peaks"" (first season), with a beautiful, stylistic set-up, and then a completely unfulfilling ending. It is fun, especially the beginning, but leaves you feeling cheated. Not a good beginning book for RAH novices...at least read The Moon is Harsh Mistress, first."
5,Worse Science Fiction book Ever,"Anyone who watches the TV show, ""The Simpsons"" would understand the meaning in my title. The book has plot holes you could drive a truck through, and I honestly believe Heinlein WANTED to write the book in this fashion. There are several parts in the novel where he uses ""tired"" plot devices such as having a person killed just prior to them trying to tell you something or having a computer waking up to become setinent. The narrator, Colin Campbell, acknowledges that these are ridiculous plot devices.I don't think Heinlein meant this as high art. I think he had fun writing it, and I certainly had fun reading it.If at all possible, I would recommend listening to the audio version of the book before reading the text version. While there are distinct differences between the two, the audio version, in my opionion, was more enjoyable to experience."
2,A couple chapters short of being a good book,"After reading this, I am still not impressed by Heinlein's work. Perhaps his earlier works were better and I will read those to give him a fair shake. The first two sections of the book was very well written - interesting characters and good plot movement. The last section was too much of a family reunion - lots of hugging and talking but nothing else. Since I haven't read his earlier works, I wasn't impressed with the reappearance of his older characters. Also I think my copy of the is missing a few pages at the end."
4,The ending is suposed to leave you hanging,"Many people seem to think the ending of Cat ruined the book, but it only added flavor. It makes you the reader think about the concept of paradox. You must THINK, and I fear that is the reason many readers disliked the book. Thinking is very hard to do, but that is what RAH has done for years; made his readers figure stuff out on their own. The only real problem I had with this book was the never even kind of explain murder at the beginning. I'd have liked RAH to have given us a clue as to what Richard would have been in for if not for his dinner companions death. Who was he? Anyway just another question I'll have to think about for myself."
1,a waste of time and paper,I agree with several other reviewers here that the first half of the book was entertaining but the ending is so boring as to seem irrevelant. Some great books such as 2001 have endings that leave you scratching your head but this does not detract from the whole. This book was so bad that i threw it away after having read 350 out of 388 pages. I simply did'nt care what happened and this is one of the few times i feel cheated by wasting my time reading a book. If I were on a deserted island and this was the only book available I think I find a better use for it than bothering to finish the last 38 pages.
1,Comedy Sci-Fi?,"No spoilers! Our protagonist happens to be a writer. And he expounds on what ít's like to be a writer. In 2 of these passages, Heinlein is quite funny about the craft of writing. However, the rest of the book is pretty dreadful. Instead, read The Puppet Masters or Starship Troopers - both are quite good."
5,The Grand Masters create worlds where we may vacation for 15 minutes at a time,"""The Cat Who Walks Through Walls"" will not change the world the way ""Stranger in a Strange Land"" did. Nevertheless, you may find yourself reading it with a highlighter. There are dozens of one-liners suitable for sig lines. None are found in ""The Notebooks of Lazarus Long"" (1978) as this book was released in 1985.Grand masters like RAH create worlds into which you can vacation for 15 minutes at a time and feel recharged. Alas, all such books all have a last page. Do you start reading it again? Do you start another in the same canon? In the case of RAH there is a lot from which to choose, so both options are open.Fans of RAH will feel very much at home here. If you are new to his work, you will be tempted by references to prior work, on which you must then surely feast. That is no reason to skip this work or not make it your first RAH meal. It stands on it's own very nicely."
3,Super Reader,"An odd book, in that it is a bit of a discussion, and so tends to be dull.It also has an odd cat, and that is usually not too good, unless you are named Seuss, or the cat is really, really big, Beastmaster.However, a bunch of his characters from other books appear here, which does make it a bit more interesting."
3,"interesting ,nothing particularly new ideas a bit farfetched","Although I enjoyed this Heinlein book I recomend reading Time Enough for Love, To Sail Beyond the Sunset and perhaps Stranger in a Strange Land before reading this. I didn't like how the book ended, but the ending turned out to be in To Sail Beyond the Sunset.I didn't like the portrayal of the charactures such as Lazarus or Jubal Harshaw, or the real reasons they were trying to save the computer Mike. Some of the time loop stuff got kinda crazy and hard to follow. Generally I love Heinlein but this seems to be a weaker edition to some of his other stories. However I would read because it is an interesting closer look on some of the less promonint characters in the Long family."
3,Half of a good book,"This book starts out great, with a lot of potential, then about 2/3 of the way through the plot changes and nothing is ever resolved. I thought the first part was clever and fast moving, but it ended with a lot of unrelated thoughts and a ton of characters thrown in, but never developed."
4,It was a good book from the begining but not to end,"Im now a new fan of RBH,The cat who walked through walls was one of the first book of his iv'e read. It was great all the way through except for the ending.I think he should have Re written the ending which had many loose ends and leave you wondering what happened to richard and gwen"
4,A WONDERFUL addition to the future-history series,"While I haven't read many of Heinlein's books, but I did find myself taken with the series. His wonderful interweaving of events provided a real life-like setting into which I was happy to escape. I do recommend reading ""The Moon is A Harsh Nistress"" before undertaking this book, and if interested in the series, begin again with ""Methusalah's Children"". OVERALL I found this book to be intriging and exciting, a must read for any lover of sci-fi"
2,Still trying to figure it out...,"The first two-thirds of this book are great. A great Heinlein thriller, with action and mystery. Then it just gets weird. Almost as if Douglas Adams got hold of the manuscript and decided to finish it off."
2,YUCK!,"Avoid this one.. the first 200 pages are great; page turner, lots of suspense & fun. After that, Heinlein starts trotting out popular characters from his more successful books (& they have no place in this novel!!) The last section of the novel is one giant committee meeting, essentially. And committtee meetings are boring enough in real life, do we really need to read about them in a sci-fi book? For over 100 pages? Finally, the last section & ending do absolutely NOTHING to resolve the set up of the first 200 pages. Yuck. I felt cheated after (struggling) to finnish this."
4,You have to think,"Scientific American has a writing style that makes the first paragraph easy to understand then gets tougher as it goes. Heinlein wrote much the same and many books have received the same reaction. ""Liked the first, but he wanders...""Since so many bad books have the same problem, one should consider how to tell the difference between bad and Heinlein.Look at the last ten pages of Cat. Very tightly written. Almost like the filming of the second bank robery in Thomas Crown (first film). I had to read it several times to see what was happening. Consider the fight in Glory Road. Driving the car at night without brakes? Metaphor. The publisher wanted to cut that one.I think that the last part put another dimension to the story and made it relevant to the future history. Skip it or denegrate if if you like, but be aware that you are missing the most intellegent part of the book. Or try again.I am still working on Finnegan's Wake."
1,"Terrible book, worse ending.","What a terrible book. I was going to give it two stars until I read the last few pages. Atrocious ending, topping off a terrible book.The only thing I liked about it were some of the ideas in it, mostly from the final third of the book, but the writing was painfully, distractingly bad, the plot was formulaic, and the entire project reeked of sexist, arrogant narcissism... A few interesting ideas can't save a book from so much crap. (Copied from my Goodreads review)"
3,Atmospheric But Unsatisfying,"This is a fascinating period in history, and what could be more compelling than a story about nuns succumbing to demonic possession at an remote French convent? My expectation of a novel combining sexual eroticism with atmospheric creepiness was fairly well met, but did not result in that interesting a book after all. The author has done a good job recreating a believable cloister of this period and the supernatual aspects of what the besieged nuns are experiencing (or believe they are). When all is said and done, however, many questions are left unanswered and the ""solution"" to the mysterious goings on is fairly predictable. I realize demon lovers are very in vogue right now, but personally I felt this novel never really hit the mark. A near miss, no more."
5,A complete reference for any limits,"Sklansky et. al. have written the definitive book on 7-card stud. It is fairly easy to read and quite complete. It is probably best for middle and higher limit games but the tactics can be adapted to suit lower limit and spread limit games. It is a must for poker players who do not want to loose atll their money when they visit the casinos and poker clubs. You can be sure that if you sit at tables in Atlantic City, Vegas, California, Foxwood etc. the player(s) across the table from you has probably read this book, and you will be at a significant disadvantage if you have not. It is worth a buy, but you must read it carefully and practice."
3,Stud Hi-Lo is Not Covered In This Book,"The book title doesn't claim to cover the hi-lo variation of seven card stud but at the same time it should be clear to people who are thinking about buying this book that the hi-lo variant of the game is not covered in this book. Also, you can not simply take the ""high"" strategy covered in this book and take it to a hi-lo game. It would be nice to see Sklasnky cover the hi-lo aspect of seven card stud to round out his take on the game."
5,Informative,"This will be short:Playing stud is a real challenge. This book breaks it down to the core. You will understand and even come to love this aggravating game. LOL.This book provides pot odds, variance, cards that out, how to bet according to the cards showing ect. It really will stimulate your mind.However, this book recomends a very conservative play style. So if you are a loose aggressive player this book will make you want to tear it in half.-George Johnson"
1,Gave Me Head Ache,"I tried reading all parts of this book several times and it's ALL so confusingly written and contradicts itself so often, that I'm sorry I wasted my time and money.I'm not a novice, I've had an income from 7-Card Stud for the past 5 years or so and I suggest you read something else.All the info might be in there but after reading just 2 or 3 sentences, ANYWHERE in the book, I was thinking, ""huh? what did he say, what does he mean?"" then I'd reread it 3 or 4 times and think I might know what he means but then, in the following sentences, he'd contradict what he had just said. I've never had such an unfriendly read on any topic.Worthless to me, I don't understand the good reviews."
5,very good stuff,"I really like the structure in the bookit id also very well written, wich was one of the drawbacks ok winning poker players, i guess malmuth contribution was very important"
4,Blessed to have the Bible on CD!!!!,"So far I think this product is great except for in a few places it cuts off in the middle of a sentence and jumps to the next chapter. It seems to have simply been recorded that way. It does this in the middle of a CD not just at the end. I think the vocal quality, pronunciation, etc is excellent.Even with the skips, I'm very happy to have made this purchase. Out of 5 CD's I noticed 2 skips(not the end of the world)."
4,Great for long car rides,"I got this because I don't always have time to read my Bible, but I'm often in my car for extended periods of time. I have found it to be very relaxing to listen to and I love that it is the complete Bible, Old and New Testament, in one binder that is easily stowed under a car seat or in a center console."
1,Feeling Like a Horse's Patoot,"I'm extremely dissatisfied with this product! I bought it thinking James Earl Jones would read the Bible with his signature slow, rich voice and I didn't notice he'd only be reading the New Testament. Unfortunately, Mr. Jones and Jon Sherberg, who reads the Old Testament, both race through the sacred texts as if the recording studio was on fire. Mr. Sherberg adds insult to injury by his flamboyant delivery ~ ""eevill"" a la Mike Meyer and other dramatic flourishes. With hindsight, I wouldn't buy an audio Bible without being able to listen to part of it first because you can't return CDs once they're opened. So I'm just out about $50 because I don't even know anyone who'd want this dud! FYI: Johnny Cash has an audio reading of the New Testament that's excellent. I just wish he'd done the Old Testament...."
5,I'm very happy,"with this product. I haven't listened to all the CDs yet. But, so far I'm very pleased. The reader is easy to understand and pleasant to hear."
3,Audio Bible,It is great to have the bible on CD. I however would have wanted the readers to slow down. It would have made the experience of listening a little more interesting. I really enjoyed the Bible Experience CD's much better.
3,AARRGH!!,The Old Testament has a narrator who is ok. The New Testament has James Erle Jones and he acts like he just stepped out of speach class and it drove me crazy . How arrogant of him. I give this a 3 only because of the Old Testament narrator.
5,GOOD DICTION,I WAS SKEPTICAL ABOUT THE BIBLE ON CD. I BOUGHT IT BECAUSE I NEEDED TO READ THE WORD EACH DAY. IT HAS BEEN A GOOD DECISION AND ONE THAT I WOULD RECOMMEND TO ANYONE WHO NEEDS IT.
5,Holy Bible,Wonderful way to study the Bible. This 60 CD set is worth every penny. I am very pleased with this high quality product.
5,Perfect,I bought this as a gift for my mom. She has gotten a better comphrension of the Bible by being able to reading along with the audio.
3,Amazon unresponsive,"The product is convenient in that, although there are many CDs. the carrying case is not obtrusive or difficult to transport. The recording artists are effective. HOWEVER, Amazon has been unresponsive to my e-mail complaints that some of the CDs are defective (skipping). I have asked for replacements of only the defective CDs (not the entire product) and they have not responded."
4,my grandmother,"My entire family loves the set. I bought it for my grandmother. She is almost 90 years old. She does not read anymore, so this was a great gift!"
5,EXCELLENT,I absolutely love having the entire bible on CD. It allows me to receive the word of God while commuting to and fro work. The narrators are loud and clear and easy to understand. Best purchase I've made in a long time.
4,Beautiful,Beautifully read. Hearing the Word read with such clarity and understanding increases one's understanding of this wonderful text.
1,Horrible toxic smell!!!,The smell is so bad that I have serious doubts about this item's safety. There should be a warning about the materials used to make these bracelets.
2,Chemical smell is off-putting,We got these for jungle-theme party favors. They had a pretty strong chemical smell that almost made me not bother giving them out.
3,Just okay.,"The fun part of this bracelet is that it snaps around your wrist when you slap it on, and that it has fun colorful prints and thus, is a perfect party favor for jungle/safari-themed parties. However, it is very cheaply made, with the ends of the fabric sticking out, so it's not likely to last long. It also has a weird chemical smell that persisted for quite awhile. Serves the purpose for a short duration of fun as a party favor, but not good for a long term toy."
3,The Destruction of the Inn,"A fairly accurate translation which may not appeal to most modern readers due to the repetitive, laundry list of description nature of the original text. This would seem to have been a good object for the kind of fictionalization Eickhoff did with Bricriu's Feast (though hopefully without the fart jokes) but in its current incarnation I think readers will want a clearer structure and more characterization than the literal translation affords."
3,Stops Turning OFF,"These little X10 ""socket rockets"" seem to work well at first for simple ON/OFF light control. But I have had two of them (out of six used in my system) suddenly stop turning OFF when commanded by my wirlesss controller. One of the failures kept the light ON full while the other truned it off only half way, dimming the light, but not fully off. My only fix was to replace them. The replacements are still working fine so hopefully I was just unlucky. Replacements purchased through Amazon do arrive fairly quickly."
3,Tiny,"I bought this for a gift, but its so small I'm kind of embarrased to give it. When its closed, its only the size of my hand. Looks ok otherwise."
4,Very pretty and pretty functional,"This is a very pretty jewelry roll. It's not large and will only hold enough jewelry for a weekender (if you are like me and wear big jewelry and lots of it). If you are a normal accessorizer, you can certainly keep your important and nice jewelry safe and tidy in this roll. And the embroidery is lovely - it looks just like the picture."
2,Jewelry case,"I would not recommend this jewelry case. I was quite disappointed that one of the compartments was very shallow.Very few pieces of jewelry could fit in the case....It did have a nice design, therefore I would give this product 2 stars."
5,Pink for a friend,"I bought this as a gift for a friend who loves to wear pink. It's perfect for her and the other colors would also be great gifts! Plus, they ship quickly!"
4,silky brocade jewelry travel organizer roll pouch,"I really like this product, I could fit a lot of jewelry inside, the only problem I had was with the button for the ring tube coming loose on my trip and having to re-sew that when I got back home. Otherwise, it packed great and kept the jewelry from tangling."
3,It's okay...,"The jewelry roll is very pretty. My problem is that this was the best out of what was offered. My ideal would have clear pockets so you don't have to look through each pocket to see what's in it. I do think that the Ring holder is a unique feature. However, I feel it is just an over-priced item that could probably be bought at any flea market or chinatown."
5,Best Of = Toss the Feathers,"One would wonder how a band could have a ""Best Of"" package with only three studio albums to their credit. Well, it is real easy if you are as talented as The Corrs. One would be concerned that a ""Best Of"" means the end. Not a chance. This group is just getting started. They are a unique group. Not since The Who, Steely Dan, and The Rolling Stones has a group been so intelligent and have a sound of their own (boy can they sing). They sound flawless. They can play and type of music. One word says it best ""Beau-talent,"" from ""The Right Time,"" ""Dreams,"" and ""Breathless."" This CD is really worth buying (worth every penny). Corrs, if you are out there, you one guy and ladies rock. Keep up the great work and ""Toss the Feathers.""This is a really good CD.Joby Allen"
1,"Fraud, out-dated product (obsolete), Not in production or used.","Primary PictureThis product (gray market, black market, flea market) is white and has a capacity of 1800 mAh, ""DURACELL Rechargeable Accu"" AA/HR6/DC1500/NiMH/1,2V/1800mAh. STD chg 180mA for 15h. Made in Singapore.Secondary PictureThis product is the current product on the market (primary) capacity of 2650mAh, ""DURACELL RECHARGEABLE 2650mAh"" AA/HR6/DC1500 NiMH/1,2V. STD chg 270mA for 16h/made in Japan.Buyers beware....Note: This review is based on a search for the product in the secondary picture, not this actual product in primary picture. I have not purchased a product from this person and I never will because this primary picture is for a product that was out on the market in 2003 and is obsolete and maybe a used or non current, old stock. Another theory is the picture was never updated due to an error. The search was through Google and not this website."
1,Wrong item pictured and described. It's 2450mAh instead of 2650.,"As many other reviewers noted, this has the wrong picture and description. Picture is of 2650 mAh; product description includes the newer ""Duralock"" branding. The product shipped is 2450 mAh and has the older non-Duralock branding."
1,the picture is wrong,the picture in the link is not matched with the battery which sent by Amazon. amazon has just warned with a small note. this is not enough. So Amazon misleads us.
1,DURACELL RECHARABLE BATTERIES,"WHEN I RECEIVED THE BATTERIES AND PUT THEM ON THE CHARGER , ONE OF THE BATTERIES BECAME ROUGHON THE ENTIRE CASING.TINY BLISTERS OVER THE ENTIRE CASING. DO I HAVE TO PAY THE SHIPPING CHARGES TO GET AMAZON TO REPLACE THE ONE BATTERY?"
1,Not as advertised,"This advertises 2650 batteries, even has them pictured, but 2450 batteries were delivered to my house. False advertisement ... very disappointed."
2,Inaccurate product advertised,"I purchased this product based on the description of 4 2650 mAh batteries. What actually came was 4 2450 mAh batteries. I had read previous reviews that stated they also received the older model batteries. I thought (incorrectly) that with multiple negative prodcut reviews Amazon would have corrected the problem and actually mailed the batteries shown. I understand the description says ""packaging may vary"", but no where does it say actaual product is different than the one picture. There is a difference between a different package and a different product."
3,Old Product same price as Walmart,"I was not pleased at the condition of the packaging, all dusty and packaging looked old and worn out, as if it was setting on a display for years almost like they were used before, but i'm sure they were not.But with that said, Duracell makes a great product and they seem to work well. I would purchase from Walmart, or other retail store in the future,I only bought them from here because I had a gift certificate and shipping was free. I think the company selling them just sells old beat-up packaged items at full retail prices."
3,Duracell AA and AAA rechargable batteries,"I got the batteries 2-3weeks ago and used just 2 AA batteries once only in my camera. The battries have worked well so far. Even though I found these batteries bit more expensive compared to the brands unknown to me, I just bought these batteries because of the popular brand name."
3,the pack of the batteries looked worn when I got it,"it seemed that I could not used the batteries right away because it took me a while to charge each of them. in addition, the pack of the batterieslooked worn when I got it. I expected a brand new looking like the picture showed on the Amazon website."
1,Not as describe,"Just got these over the weekend. The picture is completely inaccurate, and the batteries could be grey market or recycled (Made in Singapore). It came in a little plastic clear box, I mean these could be old batteries someone had in the past and repackaged."
3,No longer 2650 but 2450 mAh,"I am not sure how well that maintain a charge yet, but just wanted to let you know the listing accurately points out these are now 2450 mAh."
1,Wrong product pictured.,The actual product that I received (sold by Amazon.com) was not the duralock advertised one. It was the old 2450 mAh labeled rechargeable batteries. Misleading advertising.
2,Do not base the mAh from the image.,"Do not base the mAh from the image. I was a little put out that the batteries were not the 2650mAh batteries. The model number listed for these batteries is actually 2450mAh, which is what I received. Most people won't care but when you are looking for something particular it helps to pay close attention and cross check with the MFG. My mistake for assuming. Hopefully I can return these."
1,Wrong ohms listed,"As many other reviewers have stated, i received 2450 mAh batteries. Description shows 2650 mAh batteries. Extremely dissatisfied. Better luck purchasing these in store."
1,They are not 2650 mAh,"Putting ""Packaging May Vary"" in the title is not good enough. You will never get the 2650 mAh battery your looking for from this product."
1,"If I could give these rechargeables no stars, I would.","I've been using rechargeable batteries for 5 years, and these are by far the worst I've ever owned. If I charge them for 30 mins, I can get an hour of use out of them while I'm waiting for rechargeables that DO work to charge. They have to be charged immediately before use because they do not hold a charge when stored. Waiting until my charger's led goes out kills all charge in these, and makes them hot (scary). I've had the same four for 4 years (I guess the only plus is that I can still use them as standbys), and I've tried various charging times and chargers, with no luck getting them to hold a charge. I have bought the most generic cheap rechargeables I could find and they still work volumes better than these. Don't waste your money or add more landfill waste by buying these."
1,HORRRRRIBLE mistake purchasing this DURACELL Product,"I made a horrible mistake purchasing this DURACELL battery product. The batteries do not hold a significant charge. Upon arrival- I fully charged ALL batteries. Then I put two into a clock and within three weeks, the clock is losing time. I went to replace the worn-down batteries but the three week old charged batteries were tapped-out. I would NEVER have wasted so much MONEY on this product, I'd rather keep a stock of traditional batteries."
3,Shorter Life than Expected,"I purchased these to power my Apple Magic Mouse. With regular AA batteries, my mouse was powered for about one month. These rechargeable AA batteries are holding up about 10 days. A bit of a disappointment but I guess that is the tradeoff for being able to reuse them over and over. Charging is quick and my devices are operating just as they did with non-rechargeable batteries, with the exception of longevity. I will be buying more of these, but might checkout reviews on other brands first."
5,A Non-stop Blues Party. Get This Right Now!,"This is the late great ZZ Hill's best. Gauranteed to start your party! ""Down Home Blues"", ""Cheatin' in the Next Room"", ""Friday is My Day"" and on and on to the crack of dawn...it doesn't get much better than this, period!"
5,Old dog learns new tricks,"I've been playing harp for years. This book taught me techniques that improved my tone, my solos, my range and my overall understanding of the instrument. I'm still working on 3rd position, but at least now I have a guide."
4,Un guide complet,"Un très bon ouvrage qui présente en un seul livre toutes les techniques possibles avec un harmonica diatonique.Je ne le conseillerais pas à un pur débutant, les techniques expliquées sont assez difficiles pour un néophyte.Ce livre conviendrait selon moi à un harmoniciste intermédiaire désirant approfondir les techniques ardues de l'instrument.Livre en anglais !"
5,Great Harmonica Book,I have a lot of David's books and this is probably my favorite of all of them. This book provides some great information in a lot of different areas. One of the best books I've found for harmonica.
2,Cars,The cars are advertised as going with the race track. If you package them together then the cars should FIT the track. Really is false advertising.
1,VERY POOR,WHEN I BOUGHT THIS PRODUCT I WAS GIVEN THE IMPRESSION THAT IT WAS SOMETHING THAT I COULD USE FOR THE RACE CAR TRACK THAT I PURCHASED FROM YOU AS WELL. WHEN I GOT THEM THEY WERE JUST MODEL CARS AND I COULD NOT RETURN IT B/C I THROUGH THE RETURN PAPER IN THE TRASH AND I JUST OPENED IT A WEEK AGO B/C IT WAS A PRESENT FOR MY HUSBAND FOR HIM RETURNING HOME FROM IRAQ. SO THE PRODUCT IS NO GOOD TO ME AND I TRIED TO GIVE THEM TO MY SON AND MY SON DOES NOT EVEN WANT THEM B/C YOU CANT DO ANYTHING WITH THEM. SO PLEASE NEXT TIME YOU GIVE IDEAS FOR SOMEONE TO PURCHASE SOMETHING TO GO ALONG WITH SOMETHING ELSE PLEASE MAKE SURE THAT THEY CAN ACTUALLY USE THIS PRODUCT.
1,Don't waist your money on Amazon,The Sticks arrive all broken up. Basically crumbles in the bag. I got two separate orders at different times and both the same.
3,Clean jokes,"While Ms Heaton represents comedy I did not find myself laughing. Some insighful moments but not any that were outright memerable. Clean for the most part, the puppets are not fnny to me at all. Can be shared with the family."
3,Thou Shalt Laugh..........but maybe you won't at them all,"Some of the comedians were very funny, but some were not. I think it is just a matter of personal choice. At least the language was not offensive!"
5,NICE TO FIND CLEAN COMEDY!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!,I purchased this DVD for my parents who are devote christians. It is hard to find something clean that they woud enjoy. They really LOVED this DVD. They have watched it twice already.
4,mostly laughable,very good dvd-- most of the comedians very funny even for my boyfriend whom i thought probably wouldnt like it -he did and watched it twice the weekend i got it. nice to have good clean fun!laughs!
1,The opposite of its intended purpose.,"Of all the satire that could be expressed and directed by people of faith towards the phoniness, shallowness, and human vanity of those who constantly mock religion, not one iota of it is to be found in these performances. The only brief moments of satire appearing in this show are directed towards the religious instead, very little comedic imagination here. As much as I admire Patricia Heaton for expressing her pro-life values in the demonic domains of Hollywood, her only satirical remark here was to invoke a common stereotype by those who like to reduce Christians to caricatures as valid. Very very disappointing."
5,Hilarious,"In a day when most TV and cinema production's, so-called 'humor' has disgusting sexual content, what a relief to know that good,clean, belly-laughing humor still is possible and actually exists. This DVD is a good example."
3,they tried,"Unfortunately in today's world, when you strive to be funny and feel you have to be ""perfect"" and ""relevent"" you are often trying so hard to meet someone elses vision, you fail to be yourself.The vantriloquist (sp?) at the end was supurb."
2,Higher Standard?,"Why do my expectations usually drop when an entertainer or MC announces their Christianity? There where some good routines, but too many silly, not funny routines, where the stand-up usually ended up chiding those in the audience whom didn't laugh, as if they didn't get their joke. It was the stand-up comedian(?) who wasn't getting it! My other DVD order, ""The Clean Standup Comedy Tour"" was a better purchase."
4,Strong start and finish,"As is true with any collection, there are hits and misses, but the strong beginning and the fabulous finish make this well worth it - enjoy!"
4,Funny and wholesome,"Great for people who like to laugh, but don't want all the other stuff that comes with most comedy routines."
4,Family funny,We all enjoyed this show and laughed out loud throughout. Young and old will find these comic funny but with no worries about what the jokes may entail.
2,Not very good,"This is good for just a general guide. It provides little information on the boss fights in the game and little on tips on how to beat them. I used this and a Free game FAQ walkthrough while playing (and am still playing by the way), and the walkthrough had loads of information on item locations and how to defeat Bosses and other enemies as well. I don't regret buying this guide as it has had some benefits, but unless you have money to burn, I would get a free walkthrough and use that."
2,Almost useless.,"I can't help but agree with most of the reviews on this page; this guide is nearly useless. The Prima (the leader in half-assing every guide they've ever gotten their hands on) guide ""walks"" us through a game where chest locations are off and inaccurate, enemies don't appear in the right spots, the data on the Fiend Challenges is basically: ""kill the guys that um... you know, attack... uh yeah."" There's misspellings in a few cases and grammatical errors. Also keep in mind: their boss strategies aren't crucial to your survival, I bearly used 'em. The only slightly useful piece of this guide is the Golden Scarabs. One note on that, once you find the 50th GO BACK AND TURN THEM IN. I made the mistake of not trudging back to town due to being anxious about beating the game. In summery: don't buy this unless you really need feel you need a very small amount of visual support. You're better off on your own."
1,totally useless,"unless you are a complete newbie at ninja gaiden, this guide is worthless. full of empty space and pictures with very little information. the worst offense? ""ALL ITEM LOCATIONS"" in huge print on the cover. But, as i discovered, this guide doesn't show item locations for level other than normal!! The guide has pretty much no discussion of strategy for weapons, even omitting strats for some weapons ( like kitetsu ) because they are ""secret"". terribly uninformed and underresearched, this guide is a greivious offense to an amazing game."
1,I got the creeps,"I believe I am in the minority on this one, but I really thought this was a terrible book. I think it portrays an unhealthy relationship between mother and child. My friend's son got this book for his 3rd birthday from his aunt and we read it and thought she must be nuts (well she is a little :) Yes, I believe children need unconditional love, but with appropriate boundries. We need to let go little by little as they grow, and let them spread their wings! If we are doing our job, they know we will love them forever-no matter what. Saying it doesn't make it so."
5,wonderful story,This was my daughter's favorite book as a toddler. She's now in college studying languages and I bought this as a Christmas gift. She was thrilled. She said they did change some of the wording to keep the rhyme.
2,Get the solid handled professional server instead,"I have an aquabrew coffee pot-which is awesome-so I need to use the Avantro servers to brew into. I have had this one, with the see thru handle, as well as the Avantro Professional Server, with a solid handle.I much prefer the solid handle as it looks cleaner. This level indicator in the handle of the Avantro Ultimate Server gets dirty/stained the first time it is used and looks just nasty. The pot comes with instructions for taking apart the handle and cleaning it, but really-whos going to do this every time they make a pot of coffee!? Also, I can tell there is coffee in the pot just by picking it up, so what good is this feature anyway?Save yourself some money and hassle and get the professional server instead."
2,Mic set,I was pleased with the mic set but in the add it showed case and mic set. When I recieved it there was no case. If its not included it needs to be let known that it does not include case.
5,Indigenous Names of the Tonga of Zambia,"This book is a result of field surveys alongside theoretical translating of a large variety of personal names of the Tonga people of Southern Zambia. It would be worthwhile to subject numerous other African groups to such onomastic research. Such, as Tembo's book exemplifies, yield excellent results. Importantly, Tembo's research was done at the local level, whereby the interviewers and the researchers were of the indigenous local population. Africa is of thousands of ethnic groups, most of whose literature is scarcely uncovered."
5,This Book is the Starting Line.,"R.T. Kaser has written numerous books, on a number of subjects; the Tatot, the I Ching, and the Runes. Purists will find Kaser's work disappointing. It lacks hisory and scholarship. True enough. But, Kaser does introduce a newcomer to the Ancient Oracle with wit, humor, and skill. Enough of each that the thoughtful student will seek more. Nowhere does Kaser claim or admit to being ""The Authority."" Instead, his interpretations are fun, accurate, and easily accesible to the novice. ""Runes in Ten Minutes"" is a fun book, easily used, and contains answers that are surprisingly accurate. It is a starting point, but a fine one, and one that any novice should consider before getting into the more esoteric aspects of the Runes. A great book for the Beginner, and we all had to ""begin"" somewhere."
2,Pitiful,"Don't waste your money on this mediocre attempt to explain the runes. There are many better sources available. Scrabble pieces? Sheesh! That's even worse than Blum's ""rune cookies""."
2,Kaser's Tarot Book Better & More Accurate,Runes tend to have a limited appeal. This book is entertaining but ultimately suffers from the relative inaccuracy and inflexibility of the runes. The author's Tarot book is great!
2,Limited distance,Believe what other reviews say about the limited distance this device will work. It actually only worked a couple of times then stopped all together. A disappointment.
2,Not so Good,I have several of this type of switch for my x10 home and this one is by far the worst. When it arrived all of the switch covers were loose in the box and none of them stay on. I've lost one already making that switch difficult to use. I am now looking for more like my older models.
3,Caution,FYI - This holster does not fit a Taurus 24/7 G2. Otherwise seems like a quality product. Shipped as promised. Will update after return process is completed.
5,Fobus Ruger P90 45 ACP Holster,Another fine Fobus product. Fits my Ruger P90 45 acp perfectly. I really like the roto feature on these holsters.
4,Takes some getting used to,"I read the reviews prior to purchasing this. One guy even talked about filing down the contact points in the guard clasp. Don't do it! The holster works perfectly as it is designed. It is a ""snap draw"" holster. It will take some practice if you haven't owned one before. It definitely holds the firearm securely, and if performed correctly, the draw works every time. I own both the Taurus 24/7 in 9mm and the Ruger P90. It works well with both."
1,Boundary Waters? Really?,"If you're looking for a map to help you plan a trip to the Boundary Waters, then don't waste your money. These maps do not show portages or campsites."
4,Same book as How to Create a Magical Relationship,"This book is the same book and information as the book ""How to Create a Magical Relationship"" Don't make the same mistake I made and order both :("
2,Not what I expected....,"I bought this book because of the grand reviews on Amazon but was sadly disappointed. I feel that the whole point of personal growth is to ""work on yourself"". There is no easy way out eventhough I thought I would get a break from doing that by reading this book.I hope that people reading this will question some of the other reviews and not rush into buying something that sounds too good to be true. Thanks for taking the time to read this and good luck."
1,"[inferior] plot, flat characters","This is one of the most black&white; painted story I read in a long time. The main characters are reflecting every clichee you ever heard of: the unfaithful, career-oriented congressman, the naive wife with a job as a children's book illustrator that is not taken serious by her husband, and the ever listening, handsome ""quarter-back"" type Norvegian exchange student. There is no space for the characters to develop.After giving this book three chances to ""improve"", I gave up at page 75 (of 380). This was too much for me. When did they start to publish dime novels as hard covers?"
5,"Age difference, who cares? Worth every minute.","Oh, did I forget to say how hot this book was? Don't get burned."
5,Perfect travel tripod.,"As good as I was expecting. Slightly larger than a flimsy table tripod yet expandable to a decent size. When traveling by plane I like to keep it light and this is perfect in any carry-on. The pan/tilt head is easy to adjust so you wont have to mess with the typical ball-bearing type. Fully extended, you will have to bend over unless you prop it on a small platform (but compact size was what I was seeking)."
4,Good for price,"This is a pretty nice tripod for the price. It is short so if you plan on standing while using this, forget about it. But it does collapse to a very small size, great for travel. If your planning on taking very long exposure night shots, I would recommend going with something that is a little heavier than this. I have taken 30 second night shots with a remote and there is still some blur due to this tripod being so light. Overall, a pretty nice purchase for the price."
5,Perfect for traveling,"This is a wonderful, lightweight, compact addition for my location-travel shoots. Everything works as it should, and the build quality seems very refined."
5,Lightweight but steady,"It's very lightweight, small while folded but very useful in bicycle hikes where every kilogramm is important.Material: mostly plastic and aluminium legs.Nice carrying case included. You can hang it on your photobag or backpack."
5,compact tripod,"Fantastic value.. I checked other sites and dealers, even Ebay, and got a much better deal. A bonus is We can even use it with our digital camera.Sincerely,THE bURKHOLDERS"
1,Neck Broke Before 1st time Use (w/ a 1.9lb Camcorder),"I was so glad and could not wait to use it (as an alternative to my other heavier and large tripod). Unfortunately, the 1st time I mounted my camcorder (1.9 lb), the neck broke while I try to extend the legs (holding it about 45-60 degree, instead of straight up)... Glad I was able to quickly catch the follwing camcorder before it drop to the ground.... Very disappointed and frustrated..."
3,Too Short!,"Watch out, if your not aware already, this tripod only extends to about 39"" or so. Take a ruler our if you don't believe me, but that is rather short. I exchanged it for the next model up, which extends to about 56"". The reason I gave it 3 stars is because it would be a good tripod if your satisfied with that height limit."
3,My niese love it,I was a gift for a birthday and she loved it she wanted a backpackable one and her old one did not fit that
1,Very flimsy and overpriced tripod.,"I know, this is not heavy duty tripod for large cameras, but, there are two main reasons why you should avoid buying this tripod:1. Same featured tripods are available from other brands for $8. Are you ready to pay 3x more just for the ""SONY"" brand on it?2. The swivel head construction is very bad, there's no lock in horisontal position and there's no bubble level either, so, unless your camera has digital gauge, you will never get perfectly aligned setup, so all your photos will be distorted.I'm not going to mention how shaky and flimsy this tripod is. The manufacturer was overly optimistic, when claiming that this can hold cameras up to 2lbs in weight. Even with 1 lbs camera, when you just depress the shutter button, camera shakes so badly, makes usage of tripod useless!Verdict: You can get same for 3x lower price, or you can get 3x better one for the same price!"
2,Not for SLRs,"Maybe I missed this when I purchased the tripod, but it is not made for a digital SLR. It is actually the tripod for the handycam or cybershot, which means that it cannot hold any real weight. I liked this item for its extremely small folding size, making it easy to fit in my suitcase for traveling, but unfortunately it will not work for me. It is a little flimsy as well, so if you are thinking of putting a larger camera on it, I would pass. It could not support my Nikon 3100 (which is not that heavy)."
2,Sony Tripod VCT-R100,"This tripod does the job as a basic camera tripod for amateur photographers. It is very compact and very easy to carry around in its case. However, it is too short to take multiple photographs using this tripod. You have to bend down to take photographs or be on your knees. Also due to its short height, portrait / family photographs come angled from down looking up."
4,sturdy,"This is a sturdy, well made tripod. It compacts down easily and is not bulky to carry about. Getting it into the carrying pouch is a bit fiddly, but after doing it a few times I have the hang of it. This is my first tripod so I have little to compare it to, but it does what I need it to and the actuating parts move smoothly."
4,Worthwhile Product,The only real drawbacks with this product is that the handle for rotating the swivel is a little short and the heighth of the tripod could be taller.
3,Get what I want but not a great product,"First, it is too short to be useful and operate it is not feel convenient. Well, it is compact and light that is designed for people to carry with easily. Since it is light, don't expect it to stand stable outside in windy area."
5,Seems well built and a great price.,"I was looking for a small lightweight tripod to take with me on my travels; so that I could take pics without having to keep asking passing by strangers. This fits the bill perfectly. It seems well made and is very lightweight. It seems a great deal for $25. Also it comes with a carrying bag.The tripod is short, it comes up to my waist. But it still takes perfect pics from that low angle. I have to bend down to line the pic up, but as I am only taking occasional pics it is not an annoyance. I was trying to decide between this and the taller model up. I am glad I went with this, because I wanted something ultra small to carry around."
5,"Well made, really nice tripod","Hey, This tripod is really nice. It's lightweight, feels strong and it is the perfect size for table recording or stuff like that. I really dont require a tall tripod as I dont need it but if you want something taller this might not be your best bet.It holds firmly my Nikon D3200 with 18-55mm lens and 50-300mm lens.I highly recommend this product!"
3,Mediocre tripod. Very short. Lightweight.,Great for a lightweight hike or walk through the woods. Overall pretty cheap. I would have no complaints if it was taller. Way too Short.
2,Bad Choice,"Although its great to hold my new Dell DJ Ditty, It is way too small for my cellphone. Its too long, but not wide enough. Shipping was expensive, but came a week before I thought it would. The worst part was that it looks nothing like the picture, instead of using the premium pieces of the Alligator, it looks like they use the extra bits and pieces that they dont use to make the nicer things like the wallets or something."
4,Panama Jazz Festival,I recenctly say Mike Stern Band in the Panama Jazz Festival..Really great!!!! Slow change was awsome..
2,"Why Mike, Why?","What is it with jazz artists these days that makes them want to go out of what they do best ? As an avid Mike Stern fan I was waiting for this CD for quite awhile. When it arrived I was very dissappointed to find a sticker on the fron ""Now with vocals""? I don't understand this at all unless it's an attempt to reach out to a broader audience via commercialization. That said there is some decent playing on this CD but it is not worth the money. The vocals tracks seem out of place and in my opinion ruin this CD. Save your money on this one and pass even is yu are an avid Mike Stern fan let it go...."
2,"World Music, no way!!!!!!!!!","With exception of the last track, this album has nothing to do with Mike's past works. For a jazz fan like me, this album falls under the category ""I will never buy"".Mike, get back to jazz, please!"
1,Change Isn't Always A Good Thing,"The addition of vocals to MS's recordings is quite bizarre considering that his 'voice' is one of the most unique in the guitar improvising world of jazz. To my ears this doesn't work, it sounds as if this project was a marketing concept gone wrong. IMO not the best MS CD by far."
3,Metheny Wannabe,"Pat Metheny Group's ""Offramp"" and ""Letter From Home"" defined the category of jazz guitar and non-word vocal accompaniment. Al DiMeola's ""Kiss My Axe"" was a carbon copy of that approach, but nicely done due to DiMeola's superior guitar skills. There's nothing objectionable about Stern's copycatting here on ""Voices"" but it falls short. The band is energetic but it isn't proficient as a group in either concept or execution and Stern is only good, not ""WOW!"" or particularly gifted melodically."
2,Not fun,"I thought this would be a fun game, but I was wrong. My wife and I played this with our two children (ages 6 and 8), and my six year old caught on very quickly by answering ""pudding"" to everything. Once we ammended the rules, we still found this game incredibly boring and have not played it since."
4,Platypus Playtime,"This thing is super-cute! However, I would have liked it to be a bigger toy, or available in a bigger size, for bigger dogs. My cattle dog has decided to destroy the mom in order to keep the egg-babies for herself! I tried getting her interested in pulling out the eggs, which she does when I'm holding the platypus, but she doesn't care to bother with egg-retrieval if I just give it to her. The eggs, however, she ADORES. If something has long fur, she won't stop until she's ripped it bald. These eggs, though, have a very short fur, so she just loves to mouth 'em and throw 'em around. I wish buying the eggs by themselves was cheaper. With the platypus, though, you DO get the eggs in the belly plus a few extra, so I really liked that! Now they just need to make a bigger, more hardy version of the platypus. :D"
4,My little girl LOVES the egg babies!,"I have two yorkies, one doesn't care too much about it. He will join in occasionally on the play, but my little girl LOVES it! She will pick the egg that she likes and fetch it none stop! We got the hedgehog, shark, and turtle. I'm giving 4 stars because the opening of the hedgehog are a little too tight/small for them to get the egg. This sometimes results in them just biting the hedgehog. Fur on the back of the hedgehog, in bits, can come off when pulled. I would recommend others without the the fur on back, such as turtle & shark. I can also see some the threads near the opening so I had to cut them off. Overall, great item!"
2,"Nice stuffed toy, but difficult to remove eggs as part of the game","Like several people have mentioned in a previous reviews, this is a good toy, but it doesn't work well as a game. Like other Kyjen puzzles, dogs are supposed to find the squeaky toys inside the bigger toy (ie beehive), but it is too difficult to remove the eggs from the duck. I personally don't care for it as the original purpose of this purchase was to buy it as a game, but now it just gets torn up as a random stuffed toy."
2,Platypus with eggs,I have bought egg babies before for my dogs. The dogs love them and will play with them for hours. Beware of the eggs on the platypus. My Boxer puppy almost swallowed one of the eggs whole. It was very fortunate that she was able to cough it out. The eggs used to be larger. I was very disappointed in this toy and threw the eggs out.
3,Goods and bads,I don't usually write reviews but thought that this one needed one. We bought the hedgehog Egg Baby and thought that it worked out great. Our dog (about 50lbs) really seemed to enjoy it until he thought that the head was a ball too and liked it too much. He tore open the head (from the inside where they pull the balls from) and pulled all the stuffing out. We still use it and just stuff an extra ball in there and now he can't really destroy anything but the balls. I was also excited when I received it to see that the toy came with two free replacement balls which is always a plus for a dog owner whose dog destroys any squeaky in sight.
5,Great soft toy,My dog loves this toy. The eggs are a little difficult to get out because the opening is small. I put treats inside and that keeps her going at it. Great toy.
3,Fun but pup prefers seperate parts,"We were excited by reviews and after testing it in a store, we got it from Amazon. Our 7 mo. Golden Retriever adores it, but wouldn't try taking the eggs out. That surprised us, since she plays with a few plush puzzle toys. I showed her how, using the directions, but it still didn't take. I think it's because eating the platypus fur on the outside won out over finding the eggs inside. However, she LOVES using the parts separately - fetching and carrying the plush squeaker eggs (really sturdy...she likes ripping seams and hasn't trashed one egg yet!) and finding small dry treats that we stuff in the platypus. It held up to machine washing very well. We have to take the platypus away quickly when she's done though, because she loves ripping out the textured fur. Watch out for that!"
5,Great toy,Hank (a peagle) loved this toy. Spent all day playing with it. Did get the squeekers eggs out of it then figured he had a bunch of toys. Would recommend sewing the squeeker slot shut if you don't want to keep stuffing them back in.
3,"Didn't last long, but the eggs are great","We bought this for our 3 month old Dachshund puppy. Admittedly, he's a bit rough on toys, destroying most of them within a couple of days. While platty lasted about a month before being shredded to oblivion, the best thing about this toy were undoubtedly the eggs, four of which we still have and are still his favorite thing to retrieve.We will probably end up buying this toy again just for the eggs, but won't expect the platypus itself to last all that long."
3,Platypus toy......................,My Japanese Chin loves toys and I thought she'd really like this one but she doesn't. The balls are difficult for her to pull out. I also bought the squirrels toy and she loves that one and will take them out as fast as I put them in! I'm disappointed with the platypus because it IS hard to get those eggs out.
4,Our White German Shepherd is obsessed with the eggs!,"We have bought 2 of the egg babies now (alligator and fish) after watching a relatives dog who had the dinosaur. Our White German Shepherd, Chloe, thinks the eggs are the greatest thing since sliced bread. She can take them out of the animals very quickly, but they still provide hours of entertainment long after the squeakers are popped (which does happen fast). She puts one in her mouth and plays soccer with the others. Eventually she tears them apart, but it seems that she just likes to have the squeaker in her mouth. Any other toys that have squeakers shei immediately tries to tear apart to get to them. We now buy the replacement eggs because she really only loves the eggs."
3,"Wonderful design, but egg squeak only lasted a few hours","Was great to watch our 70 pound puppy work out the task at hand, but most of the five eggs are now deadly silent. The eggs really don't seem to have a strong squeaker in them. We are trying to find a more durable squeaker to sew into the eggs because we really like the toy, but who knows whether we'll find a way to make it sound out again.UPDATE Replacement squeakers are available for those willing to cut the eggs open and stitch them back in. Still the case that the squeakers don't last long, at least for our pup. But, while the eggs last, it is a great toy."
3,"My puppy loves it, but it only last for 2 days.",My 6 months old staffy puppy made a hole on the back so that she can easily get the eggs out. The eggs don't squeak at all after 2 days. This toy is not suitable for powerful chewer.
4,The eggs are fun,My golden loves pulling the eggs out of the belly and playing with the like balls. Also likes to sleep using Platypus as a pillow
3,a disappointment for my dog,"i have a Boston Bull Terrier and there was no way she could get the eggs out of the Platypus. the pocket is very tight and i would think that most dogs would have a problem getting the eggs out. she does, howeveer, enjoy carrying the eggs around and trying to make them squeak - she has to bite hard."
3,Great toy if you dont want a really squeeky toy.,It does not squeek very easily. The dog still likes it. It comes with extra eggs. They do not squeek easily all by themselves.
5,Excellent toy for small and medium dogs.,My dogs love this toy. I bought another toy thinking our German Shepherd would prefer the platypus and the daschund would prefer the other toy. They both prefer the platypus. I think I need to buy another platypus!
3,Just okay,"This product is alright, it's really hard for my large dogs to fit their snouts/mouths into the opening to retrieve the eggs."
4,fish didn't last the eggs are great,My small dogs chewed the fish up right away but the eggs they plays with for yrs. I would skip the toy and just get the eggs.
5,Fantastic dog toy,"We have a Staffordshire Terrier and she seems to like to have soft, plush things to hold in her mouth. The cheap, squeaky stuffed animal from Pets Mart lasted about three days, once she had removed all the stuffing she didn't like it any more.So I bought the Platypus Egg Baby, I figured it was worth a try. I was very skeptical about her getting the eggs out of the pocket and figuring out how to do that rather than chew the entire toy up.She loves it! And it took her about three days of us stuffing the eggs in and then partially pulling them out for her to figure out how to do it! She pretty much ignores the empty platypus but loves to lay there and pull eggs out and squeak them!And then the bonus is that you can buy replacement eggs!"
5,Stella's Favorite Toy,"My 15 months old pug goes CRAZY for this toy. A friend bought it for her, and I didn't expect much but she loves to pull the eggs out of the turtle belly and then she will play fetch with the eggs forever! She loves loves loves the squeaky eggs. She has ruined other toys (like a Lambchop doll with a squeaker) by ripping them up with her teeth but this has stayed intact despite the fact that she plays with it all day everyday...this is her #1 favorite toy. In fact, I am buying a second one to have as a backup in case anything ever happens to it. Highly recommend."
3,Not for aggressive chewers/shredders,"My little 13 lb. Bichon/Shih Tzu/Miniature Poodle mix had the eagles head torn open and de-stuffed within 20 minutes of arrival. He enjoys playing with it, but would be better without stuffing. This eagle is going to need to go to the rehab center, he will never recouperate and return to the wild!"
5,What a blast!,"My dog has had the IQube and all the 'Hide-A-'Critters'' for some time. He's enjoyed all of those, too. This one, though, he's had for a couple of weeks now and hasn't even begun to get tired of it. Each time I put the Egg Babies toy in his toy box, it is the first thing he pulls out! He's even taken to playing with the eggs by themselves. He likes to keep one in his mouth and squeak, squeak, squeak while he 'bats' another of the eggs around the room. We also bought the 'fish' version of this toy and he likes that one just as much. Hope that if you purchase this one, your 'baby' likes it just as much!"
5,So cute and my dog loves it,"My puppy loves this thing....it's a good size and he loves squeeking the ""eggs"" that are hidden in the pouch on the Platypus. The ""eggs"" are decent size, so you don't have to worry that they are too small for a dog to play with...that was one of my initial concerns. It's really cute too."
3,Good toy,This toy is pretty durable. The only thing is the eggs are kind of ugly and once your dog pulls them out within a few seconds you got to put them back in and then repeat over and over.
4,"Fun for me, too.","My great friend sent the platypus Egg Babies toy to my crazy Border Collie mix/mutt, Jack. I only had to show him how the eggs were hidden inside the platypus a couple of times and he went to town. He has so much fun getting the eggs out but then his big challenge is which to play with, the eggs or the platypus! Decisions! Decisions! He absolutely loves this toy and I loved the idea one of the other reviewers posted of stuffing some of his other toys in there as well. I do agree that not all dogs will ""get"" the concept of removing the eggs from the toy, my previous dog would not have had any use for that game, but he would have still loved carrying the platypus around when he was nervous. :)"
3,Hole too small or eggs too large?,"I love the concept, but my little 5lb pup can't get the eggs out - hole should be bigger. Plus, I think the hole for the eggs shouldv'e been moved up into the stomach area as all comments from friends say the same thing ""why did they put the hole where the vagina is located?"" It's a little too literal... On the other hand, my neighbor's Pug loves the eggs because they squeak and he tries really hard to get the eggs out, which I think is the point. Also, the Eagle won't stand upright - the beak is too top heavy."
3,"cute, but not durable","I have two dogs: one loves the puzzle toys that Kyjen makes and understands immediately what he needs to do. I put the squeaky things in, he takes them out. He figured this out within 10 minutes. I believe I could've had endless play with this toy with him. Dog #2, however, LOVES squeaky toys. She also was able to get the eggs out, but figured out her own way to do it. Needless to say, the duck no longer has a belly to hold the ""eggs."" It lasted all but a week. I wouldn't recommend it for strong chewers unless you're ok with spending $10 for short-lived entertainment for your dog!"
4,dogs had a good time!,"Dogs loved it! Doxies. I could put the eggs back inside over and over again, they still had a goal of gettin them out! Fun Toy!"
4,5 eggs,That's like 6 toys for the same amount money on sale. Beware eggs are tan and easy to lose in a field. My dog destroys plushes in 5 to 15 mins....she would have killed this but I take it away when she starts ripping the legs off. Loves chasing the eggs though.
2,Too delicately made,"My two dogs did love it, but the front foot came off immediately, with very little tugging by them. They do tug between each other, but they have other toys that don't tear up so easily.sorry it's not a well made dog toy"
1,Opening for eggs way too small!,"Pros:2 extra eggs totaling 5 altogetherCons:Opening for eggs too smallI could hardly take out the eggs initially and was surprised 3 managed to fit inside the PlatypusMy pit cannot get the eggs, ends up frustrated and tearing at the toy.Only 1 squeaker actually squeaked, I had to mess with the others to make them pop at the least.(Loves hide a squirrel so it's defiantly not a find the stuffing problem)"
5,Great Toy,I bought this toy for a friend of mine's dog for a gift. She is about a 70lb Golden who normally tears up toys within 2hrs. Not only did this toy last much longer than that but the extra squeekers were perfect as replacements and as extra toys.Quality of the toy is great and she carries it every where with her. Would buy this toy again.
5,Puppy's favorite toy,"Just purchased our 4th platypus for my Corgi. It takes him a year to destroy them, and aside from his chew bone and tennis ball it is the only toy he has ever enjoyed for so long.If your dog likes to remove sqeakers, get extra eggs and expect to re stuff them many times."
2,egg babies toy,"Well, I thought this would be a lot like the squirrels in the tree, which I LOVE..but, after getting the eggs back into the stuffed animal, which was NOT an easy task..my beagle destroyed the stuffy in no time at all...the eggs are still around, but not a fav for my dog."
2,destoyed by a 10 lb morkie,We thought the concept was good. Hide and seek was always our dogs favorite game. Our morkie ripped open the eggs before we even hid them in the penguin.
2,Meh...,"I bought this for my almost 7 month old beagle mix, and within 15 minutes she had the eye ripped open and the stuffing pulled out. I did spend time showing her how to get the eggs out, but she really enjoys killing her toys. She does get the eggs out pretty quickly, but she has already killed one egg completely. I had to take it away for now, maybe she will get better when she is older, but for now, the toy is adorable, and will be a special toy used only under strict supervision."
4,Good Squeaker eggs and very entertaining,"This toy is very cute and very fun for my dog. I put the eggs in the belly, squeaked them, and he immediately understood to get them out. I was very impressed because three eggs fit in there very tightly. The platypus comes with three eggs in the belly and three extra eggs. They are well made with very strong (LOUD!) squeakers and hold up to chewing very well. They also double for fetch, and as a midnight alarm! My pup likes to sit and just squeak the eggs for 4 minutes non-stop at around midnight lol The platypus is tearing a bit though. My pup is chewing through the beak and pulls out a bit of stuffing now and then, but overall the toy is very well made and should hold up to chewers. I see this toy working well for small and medium sized dogs, not sure if it is quite big enough for larger dogs."
2,"If your dog rips toys, just stick with Kong products.","I thought this would be a good alternative to keep my 6 month old pup from ripping the stuffing out of his toys. He loves the squeaker egg things, but that didn't stop him from still ripping apart the platypus that laid them. It says the opening for the eggs is elastic, but that was very easily ripped apart. He can play with the corpse but trust me it can still be destroyed. And now it just looks like I've given my dog squeaky platypus testicles to play with. :\"
1,Destroyed in 5 minutes!,"Reading the reviews I was thinking that finally I could buy a toy for my dog that he wouldn't rip up quickly. I even watched the video on this ad, and it all looked so beautiful and made sense. Then the toy came in the mail from Amazon. My dog had no interest in taking the eggs out. He was more interested in making his way to the stuffing inside the Platypus, and proceeded to rip apart the animal- and within 5 minutes the stuffing was pulled out all over the place. My dog, is a sweet 22 lb Cockapoo, a therapy dog, who is gentle and sweet- but just loves taking out the stuffing from toys. Anyway- lesson be learned...a strong chewer will always be a strong chewer. Buyer Beware!"
4,Great toy for puppies!,"My puppy goes INSANE when I squeak the eggs. She races back and forth like she just drank a two liter of mountain dew. I'm not sure if she has really grasped the idea that the eggs can all be pulled out of the dino. I don't know if she just doesn't care once she has one out, or what. I know she's smart enough to do it because she has the hide a squirrel toy and always gets the toys out. I only gave this toy four stars because one of the eggs has already come unstitched after very minimal play time. It was easily sewn back together, but I'm not sure that the eggs are very durable. If you have a destructive dog this may not be the best toy. My puppy has little sharp teeth and hasn't destroyed it yet. Those eggs are her favorite thing to run around with, and I wish I had a video of her speeding back and forth with them."
4,Platypus with eggs,"The platypus is a cute dog toy. My dog enjoys the eggs, but has trouble with the opening on the under side of platypus. The opening is too small and she can't access the eggs inside.She just plays with the eggs separately."
3,It's okay but I wouldn't buy it again,When I first got this toy the opening was so small that none of the eggs would fit. I thought if I can't get the eggs in how can my puppy get them out. The description said the opening expands but didn't. After fixing that problem my 3 month old boxer does play with it but not one of her favorite toys. I bought a squirrel with a pouch of nuts and she loves it. Mainly because it has that crinkling sound like a water bottle along with the squeaking nuts.
5,High quality toy. Great for small dogs,When I first got this I thought it may have been a mistake because this toy was so large compared to my 9 lb dog. She actually loves this. She loves ripping up stuffed toys to get the squeakers out which is annoying to me so I thought I would try something like this. She just gets the eggs out and squeaks them. I just have to put them back every now and then to keep her entertained. I would definitely recommend this to pet owners with dogs in the 7-50 lb range. Smaller than that may have trouble with the toy being too big and larger dogs may have a choking hazard on the eggs.
3,Dog loved it too much!,"Thought this was a great idea for my Labradoodle who loves to play and is inquisitive. He loved it so much that he figured out how to get the eggs out of the Platypus but had trouble getting the last one out everytime. He solved that problem by making a new opening on the Playpus's back - problem solved, egg came right out! I gave this toy three stars - loved the concept and it was adorable. Would have given it 5 stars if it had lasted longer than one day!"
4,Fun new toy!,"My dog still can't figure out how to get the eggs out of the turtle, but she loves chasing the eggs and making them squeak. The toy is well constructed and a great idea! Highly recommended for bored or curious dogs."
4,Great dog toy!,"I have 3 dogs and they all love this toy. It's heavy duty and the eggs are a perfect size. The only drawback is the squeakers die quickly, but they did include 3 extra eggs. Definitely would buy again."
2,fun for 15 minutes!,"Great idea and concept, but my 30 llb, 7 month old lab mix had every piece of this toy ripped apart fairly quickly. Not for dogs who are distructive!"
3,Cute but didn't last at all,"My dog loves to chew and whip around. I didn't think this toy would last that long, but not as short either! He tore it apart in less than 5 minutes. In the trash it went!"
5,Fabulous Toy for my nephew.,"My eight year old nephew just loves this toy, as it has three eggs to play with inside the platypus."
5,Platypus,This is a great toy. It is very challenging for my dog. She loves when we put the eggs back in. She also loves to play with the eggs alone. The product was in excellent condition. Speedy delivery!
5,Love this toy,"I have two dogs. One, a big german shepherd/lab mix and one a small Bichon mix. And both of my dogs love this toy. The shepherd isn't always in love with toys, but she absolutely loves this one. She carries it around with her all the time. She loves it so much I am buying a second (and maybe a third)."
3,Great toy with a few flaws...,"My yorkies absolutely love Keyjen toys, so I figured this one would be perfect for them. The hole the eggs go into is way too small, and my pups became frustrated and didn't bother playing with it. To remedy that, I cut the hole open more and sewed around it to reinforce where I cut. This did the trick and they loved playing with it. My one pup in particular will pull this toy out and bring me the eggs one by one to put inside. My only other complaint is that the eggs have a tendency to rip at the seams after being used several times. I had to sew those back up too. So basically it's a great toy and I'm disappointed I paid double what it is going for now... so I'm giving it 3 stars since my pups love it, but thankfully I know how to sew."
3,Cool Concept...Lasted a week,"It still exists, well, pieces of it. Our Lab Loves it still. However, with the way she chews, it only lasted about a week. I will say though, it did last longer than any other plush type toy she's had."
3,Would NOT recomend for big chewers,"I like the toy and so does my dog but it's not as durable as they make it sound. My dog enjoys digging out the squeaky ""eggs"" and so far those are holding up fine but the overall construction of the platypus itself is not that great, the feet are easily ripped off."
3,Not durable,"I ordered on recommendation of another Westie owner/rescue dogs also. She has had it for 3 years and the dogs love it.My two l0 year old Westies love them (got Dinosaur and Frog) also, but they have already got holes in the back of each one and stuffing starting to come out. For the Frog the ""inside"" has been torn and opening too large. Two eggs have been shredded! I got extra eggs also.I have had less than one month and think the animals will be gone by end of this month and maybe a few eggs will be left.Disappointed as thought they would be much sturdier.These items were bought at Amazon."
1,confused,I watched the videos for this item and the successes the dogs had at getting the eggs out but the hole is too small. I don't see how they can actually do it.
1,kyjen toy,I will not write review as I have nothing gooughd to say about this item ugh ugh ugh ugh ugh
1,Horrible packaging!,"My friend bought this for my dog sometime back and she managed to lose all the eggs and tear into the actual platypus. Since she loved this so much and loves anything that can squeak, I ordered this for my dog again. The toy came in a horrible packaging and of the five eggs three did not squeak at all. it looked like it was a used set of eggs. My dog was utterly disappointed and so was I!"
3,not loving it,"Our puppy likes the eggs a lot, and has loved other toys like this where there is a hidden smaller toy in a large toy, but it's just impossible to get the eggs out. I can hardly do it myself. It's hard to get them in as well. He's working on tearing a bigger hole in it...so maybe it will eventually work for its intended purpose. For now he'll just continue to play with the eggs and eat off the fur."
2,Cute but not good for dogs with big mouths,One of our pups (a lab mix) swallowed one of the eggs whole and threw it up. So while it is cute and fun (and clever) I wouldn't recommend it for bigger dogs.
4,fun toy,My dogs love this toy. They offer replacement eggs if you ever need them. The toy itself is very cute and I got a great value.
3,Not bad,"This is an okay toy for my toy poodle. He has a small mouth and can't really pick up the eggs. The one with the tree trunk and squirrels was better because he could easily pick up the squirrels by the tail or the head or the leg. It is nice though that it comes with extra eggs. I think this would be a great toy for bigger dogs who can open the stomach of the platypus to get the eggs. So there is nothing wrong with this toy, it's just not the best for a toy poodle with a small mouth."
4,Like this but,"Our BC had some trouble getting the eggs out. She ended up having to remove some stitches and then coming to me worried that she had ripped it too much (she's a BC and yes, she did tell me she needed her toy fixed). I reinforced it but this is the first Kyjen or egg baby product I've had to do this with (and we have many others). So I like it, the pup likes it, but she was very worried and I hope since this is the most recent egg baby, that their newer products last as long as their older ones."
5,Balls for smaller dogs! LOVE IT!!,My lhasa adores playing ball with these balls (eggs) and the squeakers are a bonus. Other toys last a day until he loses interest or tears them up. But I buy a couple of these Kyjen toys at Xmas and he plays ball with them all year long. My dog is too small to use a tennis ball and doesn't like rubber. These are his size. They're weighted enough to throw and won't harm the furniture! He's delighted with them and so am I. It gets our vote for BEST DOG TOY EVER!
1,Not suitable for large breeds!,"I bought this for my very large American Bulldog because he loves anything with a squeaker in it. He immediately took out all the squeakers and played with all of them. I never thought in a million years this could be harmful. The next morning, I woke up to hearing him throw up. I went and checked on him and sure enough, he had thrown up an ENTIRE egg. I had no idea that he could even swallow something that large! Luckily he threw it up and didn't choke on it. I immediately had to throw the toy away. I have definitely learned my lesson with giving him small chew toys. I just wanted to warn anyone with larger dogs to make sure they watch their dog the entire time they are playing with this toy and if you are not able to then you probably should not purchase this toy."
2,Not good for dogs that chew,"This toy is not good if your dog is a chewer. My Carolina Dog that's almost a year old went through this two in about 2 minutes. Since it has stuffing inside, he can no longer use it. Not sure if it's because he's young, or a chewer, but either way, this toy did not work for him at all."
3,Dogs Thrill,"The dog this was given to immediately tore it open to get the stugged eggs inside and then chewed off the nose tip. after the modiffications, it became his constant companion"
2,She loved it - but not durable enough for puppy,"Bought this toy for my brother's 18-month old goldendoodle. She loved the toy but it the hole was too small for her to get the eggs out of the platypus. Once the eggs did come out (with a little help), she was able to rip them open in very short order. Luckily there were some spares included but I doubt they will last long either!"
3,Dog 1----- Platypus Eggs 0,"Have a 40# Elkhound/Husky and he found the ""eggs"". Then he destroyed the ""eggs"". Nice idea, but the squeaking device and the egg insulation were no match for this 2 year-old canine. Would probably be great for a smaller dog. Would like to be able to walk away from the action, rather than continually switch or hide the eggs."
3,Good value as six separate toys,"The platypus is cute, and the eggs mean that you are getting six toys for the price of one. Unfortunately, the advertised use is a no-go: my dog has no interest in trying to fit his snout through the rather tight opening in order to fish out the rather slippery eggs."
5,My dogs love this,"I have 3 dogs and they just love playing with this.One of them, the lab, is in love with this toy.I often see her walking around with it.It's super cute.I think I made a great buy here.I recommend this 100%"
3,Hard to get to eggs,"My dogs (2 Schnoodles) LOVE the eggs because they fit in their mouths and can squeak away with them. They didn't get the idea of ""digging"" them out of the platypus. The opening is small enough that when the eggs are inside, they won't just pop out, but that makes it hard to get them out in the first place."
3,I guess I have dumb dog!,My little girl (rat terrier) loves to play hide and seek with her treats so Santa (yes he came early) got her this and she does not get how to take the eggs out.....she loves to play fetch with the eggs and they squeak when she bites down and shakes them. It is a really cute and clever toy and I will work on it more with her......Well it has been a few weeks now and all my dog want to do is play tug-a-war with it and shake it around and it shows....seams comming undone...I agree with some other customers...it is difficult to get the eggs out (very snug opening)....
4,Fun!,"This is a really fun toy, but we only bring it out to play with TOGETHER with our dog - otherwise they would easily and likely rip it apart."
3,My 100 pound lab destroyed this,"really I have to put 15 words to rate this? My lab killed this in about a day, The eggs on the other hand he still plays with and loves months latter."
1,My dog..must be..dumb....,I saw the video that the first reviewer posted...and bought this toy...not only did my dog rip open the nose and the stuffing in the first minute she played with it..but..no matter how many times i showed her..she has never taken the balls out...and..I always thought she was smart..lol....or perhaps..I am not too swift..and cannot train her to do what is in the video..lol
4,"Good toy, entertains my dog","This is a good toy. My dog enjoys it. She is a beagle and she ""hunts"" the eggs/balls and won't stop until she has them out of the dinosaur. Then she runs around and plays with the balls. It keeps her busy!"
2,"A little confusing, not as good as hide-a-bee or hide-a-squirrel","Even though the hedgehog as a baby is usually one of my dog's favorite toys, he still doesn't seem to get that there are eggs INSIDE this toy, even after showing him. Much better are theKyjen PP01055 Hide-A-Bee Pet Toy, Largeor theKyjen PP01056 Hide-A-Squirrel Pet Toy, Large, because it is clear when they look at it that it is a large plush item, but that babies are inside each ""window"", because they LOOK like babies. The eggs in this toy simply look like non-descript ""balls"". Not as much fun.So even though he knows they are in there, he has a lot more fun with the bees, the squirrels, or even the rabbits in theKyjen Magic Hat with Rabbits Puzzle Plush Interactive Dog Toy.Can't really recommend this toy except as a regular hedgehog."
1,Squeezey noise needed,"Purchased Platypus with 5 eggs. Two eggs are set aside as extra, as they do not fit into the Platypus. Of the three included eggs with the Platypus: One made noise when I squeezed it; The second made a meek noise after I manipulated it; And the third is a brown soundless hairy lump. My dog, BEAR, is easily occuppied. I stuck two treats up into the Platypus, to get him interested; he is occuppied. Final opinion: The squeezy sound is not always there."
2,My Dog loved the eggs till she swallowed one.,"I am not one to write reviews and I really do depend other people's reviews when I purchase toys for my dog. However, this past weekend my dog swallowed (not chew) one of the furry toy eggs. It is about the size of a lemon and any medium to large size dog would be able to swallow one with ease.I just want people to use caution. Having to give a dog hydrogen peroxide and mineral oil is not a lot of fun for either party. I have had this product for a few months now and if I wrote the review right after I purchased, it would have been a 5 star but i just think the eggs are a bit too small for some dogs."
4,Eggs more fun than penguin,My dog loved his gift but he immediately began to remove the fur from the top of the penguin's head which came off pretty easily. The squeaking eggs have become his obsession and he loves them.
4,platypus,"I have a 6 month old golden setter. It took a little time for him to realize that he was supposed to pull the egg babies out, but once he did, it was on, he is intense on getting them out. I think I saw him try to put them back him. He will bring it to me empty with eyes that say, ""more eggs please"" 4 stars only because I wish it was a little larger to hold more eggs.Teresa HoldenKernersville NC"
1,Misleading description,"Buyer beware. The description includes the utterly irrelevant information that there are 25 binders in a box, but you don't get a box. You get a single binder."
1,$10 for one binder?,"Am I missing something? These go for $1.25 elsewhere. Even office depot, the leader in high prices only want $1.99........Or is the product description unclear? I says qty 1......"
2,The grammar is horrendous,"I have not finished this book yet. But the author's grammar or grammatical style is horrible. The run on sentences are too much! There are too many thoughts in one sentence. He tenses are not correct and his wording leaves many ambiguous ideas. I hope i can get through this book so that I may write a better review.I can forgive grammatical ""errors"" in dialogue, but not the narrative."
1,Flat and monotonous.,"The subject is interesting, but the characters and the writing are boring. The characters are one dimensional and the writing style is very simple and flat with short sentences lacking a smooth flow. There are no interesting insights or observations by the narrator leaving one detached and uninvolved. As others have commented the story also jumps around a lot and so many characters are introduced leaving one confused."
2,"Intelligent, thoughtful, and utterly unreadable","I bought this book because of a glowing review in the New York Times Review of Books. I have gotten to page 57 and I cannot go on. This material has been covered before. And was this author assigned an editor? Even thus far, some characters are confusing, and some material repeats.The review I read suggested that the book is new and original because it covers the topic of a black man owning slaves. But I am only at page 57 and this black man has died, and there is far too much angst going on about it.If you have to read this because it's on the college book list, schedule extra time for this one."
2,Bad choice for awards,I found this book poorly written. It dragged on with too many characters that I lost track of and of who belonged to whom. Boring! I was very disappointed.
2,More Hype than Hope,"Again, like the Emperor of Ocean Park, critics annoint a mediocre book. I don't know why they do it. Most readers I've met said that it was interesting. That's about it. And it seemed to be split down the middle among black and white readers--meaning an equal number on each side didn't think it was that great. I would have thought that black readers would have all hated it. But it looks like some, like my wifes black female friends, are so saturated with romance books that when anything with meat comes along they will embrace it.I was impressed with the Faulkner-esque creation of a mythical Southern county. But the images and themes really don't set me afire beyond that. Maybe people need to take a deep breath, and mayb we need to make this one of those times where the critics are wrong. Usually, weingore them and buy truly silly books, but some times, we are right on the money. This is one of those tims (like the Emperor of Ocean Park)."
2,"oh, the tedium","So my guess is, the author did tons of research, then came up with a plot to string it all together. Census data? Why, oh why am I reading this. Perhaps since I lived in Virginia for 12 years and studied history there, I kept waiting to be hit with some insight or information to bring this book to the point. Didn't happen."
3,Ok but I have read better including his short story book,I felt like Edward Jones lost the focus of the novel. The first half was much better than the second half of the book. I really had to push myself to finish it. His short story collection I highly recommend it is definitely worthshile reading. This novel did teach me a fact thought that some African-Americans owned slaves before the Civil War which is something I never knew about. So it is a interesting novel but I think it missed the mark.
3,Politically correct--overrated,"As the selection for my book club this month, I read the book and am not sorry that I did. However, considering its numerous accolades, I was somewhat disappointed. The author skipped around with the characters a lot and used poor grammar many times. I suspect that, if not for the subject matter, this book would not have been given the attention it has."
2,Way too boring and confusing - couldn't finish it,I have been trying to read this book for over a year. I can't get into it and I think it's time to throw in the towel. I have gotten half-way through but the author jumps around too much. The stories are interesting but don't really seem to have anything to do with one another. Too many characters - could use a cast of characters or map showing how characters are related at the beginning. The upside is that the individual stories are well written and it addresses some interesting topics.
5,This book has spoiled me for other books,"This is one of the best-written novels I have ever read. When I go back to the novels I usually read - popular mystery, thriller, etc. they seem to me to be ""plot plot plot"". In ""The Known World"" there are characters and events happen to them. The characters seem extremely realistic. They don't just advance the plot, and yet it's not like there are boring passages that you are tempted to skip over."
4,Exploring the legacy of slavery,"This fascinating novel brings you into the hearts and minds of those touched by slavery in the decades between the cataclysmic war between the states: black slave owners (who knew?!), white slave owners, poor whites, slaves and free blacks. With luminous prose, vertiginous shifts in time and places, and characters that never fall into archetypes, this novel compels the reader forward, into a world previously unknown. You won't be quite the same after reading this book."
5,Incredible story,Edward P. Jones does an incredible job of weaving an incredible story with an incredible writing style to make an incredible novel.
4,Known World Comments by Rindge Leaphart,"This book was a little bit of a tough read for me, but enjoyable nonetheless. It was a little bit out there at times but the author strung together the various stories and brought it all home with clarity.Rindge Leaphart"
5,JUST FINISHED ENJOYING THIS BOOK YET A SECOND TIME!,JUST FINISHED ENJOYING THIS BOOK YET A SECOND TIME!I downloaded this book to my Kindle based on reading a mention of the book in a magazine .. not realizing I had read it earlier when it first came out in hard cover! As I began to read it on my Kindle .. I realized I had already read it! BUT I found that I was enjoying it so much I continued! Now having finished it .. a second time .. I decided to take a moment to heartily recommend it to others. Other reviewers have given eloquent informative reviews on the book so I will not bother to say anything other than .. you will not regret the purchase!
5,Simply Wonderful,"That there is an author out there who can take on such a sensitive subject and look past the indignity, heartbreak and ignominy of slavery to present the depth and complexity of his characters, to really bring them to life, is a truly wonderful prospect for us, those who derive pleasure from indulging in an unknown world, an unknown reality and a completely foreign way of life via literature. Jones is an amazing intermediary employing seemingly effortless transitions across time, race, class, and gender to allow us a window into a past that oddly enough seems not only posisble but under the circumstances he describes uncomfortably plausible. Personally, I hope that he has more similarly great works in his future. But, even if he does not, this book would be the masterpiece of the collected works of anyone but the greatest authors plying the trade today."
3,Not worth the effort,"The plot kept building and building with characters coming and going. It was a bit confusing for a while. I kept plugging along though. I kept hoping for enticement...that moment where you find yourself so absorbed that you can't put the book down. Well let me tell you honey, that moment never really came. In fact, not only was it easy to put down, but I had to pick it up from the floor each morning and try to figure out where I left off when I fell asleep. The last 50 or so pages were the most exciting, but overall, not worth the effort and frankly anti-climactic. I did appreciate the topic though and I enjoyed the unique writing style. Unlike other books of this era, I did get a better idea of what life must have been like for a slave. This greatly moved me. And for this, the book will be memorable."
2,Frustrating Book to Read,"This book is one of the most poorly constructed books I have ever read. The author skips, without thought, from one unknown character to another without explanation. He fast forwards twenty years hence with a little note of what a particular character will be doing. The subject matter had such great potential. The book drove me crazy trying to figure out who these extraneous characters were that Jones kept throwing in and how they had anything to do with the story. How this was a Pulitzer Prize winner I cannot fathom. Very very disappointing book!"
3,Disappointing,"I was prepared to love this novel, but I did not. It glossed over too many characters. The novel would have been better had it concentrated on a few characters and a central plot. The novelist does give a list of the characters in the back of the book. One can cast an actor in the role of the more important characters to try to get a sense of things. Further, the tale is not told chronologically. It jumps around. With so many characters this is just an unneccessary source of confusion. I did enjoy learning about the free southern blacks who owned plantations and slaves of their own. I had hoped to learn more about Fern's relatives who were passing for white in the North, but alas it wasn't to be."
3,Too disjointed,I found it hard to follow in places. Some of the events didn't seem to fit into the overall theme.
2,Could not get through this,"I agree with so many of the other readers. This book was difficult to follow. I am so glad I read these reviews -- I thought it was just me. I am an avid reader of all kinds of literature, but this was one big mess. Couldn't keep up with the timelines and the characters. I put it down. I usually plow through books, even if I don't like them. But, I decided this was a waste of time. Big disappointment."
5,Beautiful Book,Beautifully written book. Was so impressed I purchased a book of Mr. Jones' short stories. Can't wait to immerse myself it it...
3,"partial review, i am only halfway through the book","This is for those of you who may start the book, and become a bit confused about the people, and their interrelationships. The hierarchy between master and slave was confused even more when ""color"" did not always apply. I have found it sometimes difficult to understand, as the author writes in a dispassionate voice. I also intend to follow the author's narrative to the end. I would suggest that you do as well; Mr. Jones' research appears to be excellent.Mr. Jones' book is part historical research, and part fiction, both parts are well worth reading, and make a more complete novel.I am not sure if this is appropriate in this review, if so, amazon will tell me so, but, I keep thinking that someone who reads this should also read The Bondwoman's Narrative by Hannah Crafts...if you should, great, if not, read this book as it stands by itself"
2,A dissent from all the accolades....,"First of all, I'll admit I gave up after 100 pages, but I think that's a fair trial. I suppose I see what Jones is trying to do with his incessant time traveling--show the historic and personal effects of slavery as an institutional network that traversed the ""known world"" across time and space. Or at least that's what I think he's trying to do. This may be an interesting and creative approach (the two stars are for effort), but extremely uninspiring and uninvolving--and very annoying--in its execution. Vonnegut did it better in ""Slaughterhouse Five"". ""The Known World"" is yet another book that impresses critics and wins awards with its high-concept literary pyrotechnics, but has no story and no people that really capture one's imagination. It has, one will excuse the expression, very little soul. The book left me cold. I'll stick with Baldwin, Morrison, Wideman, Angelou, Walker, and--especially on the subject of slavery--Frederick Douglass."
3,A decent read....,"I read or rather listened to the unabridged audio version of this book. I have read through the reviews and saw where people were having a difficult to impossible time keeping up with the characters because there were so many and he did so much jumping back and forth in time. I can see where this could happen had I read the printed book rather than listening to the audio. Kevin R. Free is an excellent narrator and I think this is a large part of why I didn't get confused or lost with the amount of characters. I strongly urge readers to enjoy the audio version of this book because of the many characters and subplots. When the voices of the characters are being performed for you via a live narrator then it is easier to hold the story together in your mind.Overall, for a debut novel, this wasn't that bad. Like I said it was decent and it does give food for thought."
2,waters down the pullitzer price,"With this book winning the pullitzer in 2004 and the premise being a freed slave who goes onto own slaves of his own, I anticipated a deep and complex novel with a moral conundrum spliced in. Instead, the book tried too hard in its scope and was watered down with so many characters that you never figure out until the end that there isn't even a ""main character"" at all. You can tell the author even knew there was too many characters because he constantly reminds you who the characters are by repeating who's related to whom and reiterating what there role is. You're given so much info on secondary characters with fleshed-out back stories only to figure out it plays no part of the story at all. After completing the book , I felt like somebody was just droning on about a series of people only to forget what the point of the story was."
3,Geiger's Review,"I would rate Jone's ""The Known World"" a 7 out of 10, 10 being the best. I liked and disliked different things about the book. First of all, what I liked: I liked the overall story that Jones tells, I thought that it was indepth and very interesting. Some people complain that Jones didn't write about real life events and that it was just a bunch of lies. I look at it that if Jones can create those scenes, with as much detail as he did, more power to him. On the other hand, I disliked the enormous amount of characters present in the book. I think that when you have that many characters it can take away from the story itself when the reader is trying to get all of the characters straight instead of enjoying the story itself. I would recommend this book to a serious reader who is willing to read indepth!"
3,The Known World: a Novel,This is book that needs total concentration and time to read. It is very hard to get through. It jumps around from past to present in just a few sentences. The writing is great and images are easy to see. I woudl reccomend this book to those that have time adn energy to put into followign the storyl.ine.
2,Gave up on it.,"I was aware before I started this book that free African-Americans were slave owners in the days preceding the civil war so this was not really a revelation. I read books all of the time and I rarely quit on one but I gave up on this one. There were too many characters and no discernible plot over half way through the book, just anecdotal comments on the lack of morality or fairness in the world. I would be curious to know exactly why the Pulitzer committee would pick this book."
2,Overated! Another Pulitzer PC Sellout,"""The Known World"" got a Pulitzer and good reviews, so I bought it. If it weren't about slavery it wouldn't be on the literary radar screen - pedestrian writing, totally humorless, pedestrian, a triumph of the PC society. And some of my best friends are humans."
1,DON'T WASTE YOUR TIME OR MONEY ON THIS BOOK!,I have read the previous reviews and can't for the life of me figure what book everyone else read. To even put E.J.'s name in the same sentence with Toni Morrison is a crime. The book has absolutely nothing positive about. I live in Washington and have sworn that if I ever meet the author I will insist on my money back. Pulitzer? MacArthur grant?..this book is no more than a MARKETING MASTERPIECE and not worth the paper it's printed on!
1,Odd looking,"The pages are not even cuted; some are larger and ame are slightly smaller.looks old, too."
2,I really don't have to read this trash,"Blacks owning blacks in pre-civil war America.It's sick...somewhere between porn and child abuse.The major prejudice behind black slavery was that blacks were subhuman.A book by a black man that is admittedly well written and researchedthat shows an amorality in blacks is not a gray area.I tried to get into it, but his characterizations are just too unrealistic.These people were debased and evil in their behavior.Let's write a book that excuses that? The book exploits the worst inhuman nature, then you've got a mostly white liberalliterary establishment giving it a prize?It's trash and the author should have had enough social conscienceor respect for his own culture to know it.My reaction is disgust."
2,Lost,I was lost from the beginning. This style of writing doesn't work with me. I gave up half way through.
2,Gave it a try,"Books can be a tremendous waste of time, or a doorway to another dimension. I do not read entire books to wait for them to get good. If a book stinks at fifty pages, I stop, as I did with the Known World. Look at all the bad reviews of this book; they all say the same thing. The author introduces very many characters that are just glossed over. There is no penetrating analysis of thought processes, there is only brief description of events, making for a jumbled, slow, boring, and confusing read. Life is simply too short to read entire books like this that are written excruciatingly badly. Not worthy of a Pulitzer. Not worthy of my time."
2,Confusing Narrative,"I was excited to begin reading this book, but have had so much trouble getting into it that I don't think I'll finish it. I rarely begin a book that I don't read to the end, so quitting was a major decision for me. The narrative is disjointed and I find myself constantly confused regarding characters and the chronology. What a shame, as I think the subject is interesting and important."
3,Worthy but dull,"The scope of the novel and its structure of moving among a wide variety of plots and characters is fine, but I think Edward Jones doesn't really pull it off. Despite some compelling moments and illuminating descriptions of the social culture and living conditions of life in that time and place, I was left feeling indifferent. None of his characters seemed to draw me in - certainly they all had interesting and often tragic stories, but there is something superficial, and matter-of-fact in the way Jones writes about them that left me yawning. Perhaps it's a dry literary style in vogue in Pulitzer circles, but it lacks the warmth and soul to touch the heart as well as the mind."
4,rewarding but challening,"This is a masterfully written historical novel about slavery in the pre-civil war south. the setting is framed to provide a sociological feel for life in small, rural southern communities of that era. the voices of the characters are compelling and haunting; as in the best historical novels, they allow us to see and feel history through them. jones does not preach; the ""moral ambiguities"" which so many reviewers have mentioned speak for themselves. Potential readers should be forewarned, however, that this book is far from an easy read. the plot moves slowly and does not follow a strictly temporal sequence. there are so many characters it can be difficult to follow at times. and the incredibly sickening brutality and dehumanization of that era is set forth matter of factly by the author."
3,An Ordeal....But Worth It,"I decided to read The Known World because I was told it was written with a very informative look towards slavery and offered many ideas not often covered in depth.Unfortunately undertaking the reading of this book started for me with difficulty. I could not grasp the author's writing style and I almost gave up several times in dissapointment. But thankfully I read on and towards the last 100 pages finally got involved. With so many characters to keep track of it would have helped to take notes in the beginning, especially since the author jumps about from time, character and place so often. The author's writing style distracted me from involvement with his characters until the end of the book.But most importantly I learned something new. The Known World expanded my own. Not only did I learn about other sides of slavery, I also learned how to read outside the norm and found myself involved in a facinating read."
3,A Distant Tale,"I went to The Known World expecting an exceptional read. I was excited. What I found was less than I had anticipated. The writing was clumsy. I tried to read a number of passages outloud and stumbled all over the words. The sentences are convoluted and difficult to get past the tongue. Another problem: I had difficulty getting close to any single character. All the characters seemed to be viewed from a very long lens. Mr. Jones uses another annoying writing technique: he tells us what will happen and then he uses the characters to illustrate what he has just written instead of placing the characters in scenes and allowing the readers to see the action for himself.The novel has some fine aspects, however. It's a nice piece of history brought forth in fiction. I thought it was a good first novel, but certainly not the quality I would have expected in a Pulitzer."
4,A Worthy Effort,"Set in the 1830's ""The Known World"" is a story of Henry and Caldonia Townsend, two educated black slave owners in Manchester County, Virginia. This is no doubt an important novel because it deals with one of the unique complexities of slavery - black slave ownership. As he tells of the Townsend saga from slavery to freedom to prosperity to decline author Edward P. Jones paints a vivid landscape of time and characters.I enjoyed ""The Known World"" though I had to work very hard to get there. I had difficulty getting into sync with Jones' narrative style. Perhaps it was the number of characters he kept introducing or perhaps it was his constant shifting of time that kept me off balance. But I was never able to get into a flow where the pages just swept me along. However, in the end the novel did succeed in touching a range of human emotions and capturing the feel of that turbulent period of American history. And that made the effort worthwhile."
5,The Known World,This book gives insightful information about our nations history....Very enjoyable book. The plot is very well written. Few books compare to this read. Masterful!
3,Not as Good as Sweet Smoke by David Fuller,"I unfortunately read Sweet Smoke by David Fuller first and so found this book seriously lacking. This book does carry the same affecting scene's from the plantation. The characters are well drawn and interesting but where is the plot? Okay African Americans owned slaves got it but beyond that ...this book is a book of insights into day to day life on a plantation. And yes, there were odd white plantation owners living in remote areas of Virginia. I'd say well written, yes, interesting, mildly. It is not exciting, not driving, its day to day. Yes there is human tragedy but its not essential to a central plot. Personally I could not recommend this book over David Fuller's novel which is well worth the read. This book is worth the read if you have not read any of the novels based on the new scholarship into slavery. I think if you enjoy a good story as well you'd be better served by Sweetsmoke."
5,A phenomenal read,I recommend this book for anyone looking to learn as well be entertained. It's a very intriguing story that peeks into a more personal level of slavery and what our ancestors went through as they lived their private lives on a daily basis. I rate 5 stars times 10. Hands down.
4,Great story...how authentic?,This was a well-told story of life in pre-civil war Virginia. I was disappointed at the author's attempts to make it sound historically accurate (references to census reports) when he was making most of it up.
2,"Slow, From Start to Finish","After almost a month, I finally was able to finish this novel. Except for occasional moments of intrigue, interspersed with episodes that evoked outrage, the plot just plodded along, and none of the characters, other than the institution of slavery itself, ever came to life.Moreover, the writing style was stilted and archaic, and the ending, which was supposed to pull everything together, did not fulfill its advertised promise. In fact, the conclusion was particularly disappointing, except that it brought an end to my mind-numbing boredom."
2,Disappointed,"With a gold encircled ""Winner of the Pulitzer Prize"" on the jacket cover, I was all set to be whisked away to ""The Known World""... but instead, ended up in my own world; mind wandering and unable to follow the story line. I also had to re-read sections to keep the characters straight. That's too much like home work for this reader. I found ""The Known World"" boring and I put it down half way through, something I rarely do."
1,Tedious Beyond Endurance,"I finished Chapter 1 and found that I had ""met"" dozens of characters and hop-scotched among several decades of parents and progeny. I should have made notes. No, I shouldn't have. That's not how I want to read fiction, no way, no how.A lot of ""reviewers"" like the book. I did not and didn't start Chapter 2. The local library can have my copy."
1,Very hard to follow,I did not find this to be an enjoyable read at all. The story was very hard to follow and I would not recommend it.
2,Pure fiction,"Jones has admitted that he did not do any research for this book. He must have researched slavery or at least learned a little about it at some point, but basically he's taking a very sad event in black history and completing fabricating a story. The places and people aren't real, even the ""historians"" he mentions are fabrications. As a novel, this is not a bad book but as a look at one element of the story of American slavery, this novel does nothing to contribute to our understanding. Fictionalizing slavery can be done well but if the author doesn't research the topic, the reader cannot see it as a book about slavery but as a novel about people who are dropped into a slavery setting. There's a huge difference and it's a shame that the difference isn't made clear in an author's note at the start of the novel."
2,Boring and tedious. Don't expect to be entertained.,"I can't believe this book won the Pulitzer prize. The premise is interesting but far from what really happened. I think Jones could have done a much better job given his creativity. There are way too many characters in the book (there is a summary of all the names in the book at then end which is very useful for refernce). Because of the different characters, the reader is unable to connect with any one of them. The writing is okay.From a historical standpoint it is not of much use since nothing close to what Jones describes really happened. On the positive side, he does paint a nice picture of life during those times and I also appreciated his creativity."
2,Not that great,"I bought this book because I thought it would be a magnificent read, but I found it to be slow, and a little hard to follow. The time-jumps kept throwing me, and I would have to go back and reread certain parts to catch back up. The subject matter is wonderful, that's why I thought I would like the book. It wasn't everything I was hoping for."
5,Amazing and wonderful,"A brilliant novel in every way. Read it and weep...after you finish it, you won't want to read anything else for a while, just sit and think about what you have read. Tackles the most difficult subject for American letters -- slavery -- from an oblique angle, which makes it all the more compelling. Deserves the Nobel Prize for literature. We have had to wait 11 years since Mr. Jones' short story collection for this wonderful book; I can only hope the next one won't be so long in coming."
2,not sure I will finish,The sentences in this book are the longest sentences I have ever read. I feel like I am reading a rough draft rather than an edited book. Clumsy writing. I drew a map to keep track of the characters but still found it impossible to track the time line. The same statements are repeated over and over in this book. I keep going to back to find where I just read the same thing. The story had promise but the writing ruined it.
4,A Stunning Novel about a little-studied aspect of history,"There have been many books written about the slave experience but, to my knowledge, none that explores with such sensitivity the relationship between African American slave-holders and their African American slaves. The book traces the stories of a family of slave owners, their neighbors and friends, and the slaves whose lives are in their hands. In addition, this incredibly well-researched novel presents a vivid picture of the casual and brutal violence that was part of a society where the majority of its members were legally considered Property.This is not an easy book to read, because there are parts of our history that it is more comfortable to gloss over, or to forget. ""The Known World"" contributes to the essential task of remembering, and honoring the courageous men and women whose emancipation was written with fear and blood and pain."
4,The Known World,"I was so caught up in ""The Known World"" that I read it in two sittings. I had thought myself quite educated in matters concerning slavery in the U.S. before and during the Civil War. The book reveals to me that freed black persons owned slaves in the South, while I had thought that happened only in the northeaster part of the U.S. A captivating story, indeed. Mollie F. Howard El Paso Tx"
3,will appeal to some,"I was a bit disappointed in this book, expecting in depth characterstudies of the slaves and their owners, but instead was treated to a relatively jarring and disjointed presentation of the story, without really learning about the characters, their motivations, thoughts, etc. I did enjoy it though, after making myself complete the first 50 or so pages, although my husband gave up!It has it's merits, an unusual style (if you like it) and presentations of little known historical facts (fictionalized though)"
2,Not all that,"I have come to agree with those who are wondering where all the accolades came from. There is not a character in this book, that one grows attached to. I will say I enjoyed the style of the book, very non-linear. He obviously fooled those who thought he did massive research, he has said in interviews, he did NONE!! That is an obvious nod to great writing and hence the two stars. Still wondering what was the motivation for Henry to go on and keep acquiring slaves??"
4,Fabulous and Beautiful Story...Evokes Every Emotion,"Wonderful story, poignant and sad. Enjoyed but there is a lot of jumping around. I have to read in bits and pieces due to time allotment. Makes it difficult to stay with the story. Lots of unanswered questions but most get tied up in the end. So interesting to hear about blacks owning slaves, which to many is incomprehensible, but given that we are still dealing with racism on every level today, not so unbelievable.Definitely a good read, especially if you have time to read with large chunks of time. Enjoy!"
4,"Non-linear, but worthwhile","_The Known World_ was not an easy read for several reasons: the myriad of characters can be a challange to track; the story, like life itself does not go in a straight line; and like life, persons are introduced, disappear and reappear as the story unfolds. Frequently the narration of the book goes off on tangents that have no real place or bearing on the main story line. This is no doubt distracting to some; I found these diversions conversational (in a ""southern"" sort of way) and added to the flavor and richness of the characters, which compensates for any frustration initially felt.What struck me the most was the underlying commentary Jones makes about the institution of slavery - essentially that it twists and malforms all who are touched by it, regardless of race, gender or place on the social heirarchy. It was moving in this regard. I enjoyed the book immensely and recommend it."
3,"Good, but not worth a Pulitzer","I think that the book told an important story, and caused me to think about the pernicious effects of slavery. However, the book had many awkward passages that I had to read 2 or 3 times to understand what he was trying to say. When I read Faulkner there were also passgaes that I had to re-read. However, when I re-read Faulkner I thought to myself how clever and complex the passage was. When I reread the passages in this book I thought to myself how needlessly confusing.I've already learned to stay away from Booker prize winners because the winning books are judged more in terms of their political correctness than literary merit. I hope the Pulitzer isn't going down the same path."
3,Film is 5 stars but tape image is 1 star,"Really poor quality of the image in this tape. So bad because the film is 5 stars, great Gazzara performance."
5,"Death is not the End, Love is Eternal","We are living in a mean spirited age of hardcore Materialism and Reductionism. The Dogma that is constantly trumped into our minds Death is the End and there is nothing after has had a terrible impact on society.Thank God for Stephen Levine, reading this book will help us embrace our Divine and Eternal Nature of Love. We need not fear Death. Death is not the end. Death is just moving from one plane of existence to another. While we are here we should be kind to one another and appreciate each moment we have together. Thank you Stephen Levine for your bright shining light of love and peace."
4,Vocal Mastery and Major Hookfest,"While some more shallow music fans will say, ""Why didn't you make another album that sounds just like Jellyfish"", more enlightened, mature, sophisticated listeners will fall head over heels for this masterful mix of harmonies and hooks. This is a mostly acoustic affair, and while it pains me to even say this, calling them the ""male"" Indigo Girls wouldn't be way far off the mark. Thankfully though, they've left off the treacly, juvenile sermonizing that renders much of every Indigo Girls release unlistenable, and added way more memorable songs to the mix. These two voices blend together beautifully, and I for one, am happy to see artists do something other than ""Part 2"" of their previous release or band."
5,A Solid Sophomore Effort!,"I'll cut to the chase: If you've listened to Rob and Tim's first album as the umajets and are were left begging for more (you should have been), this album won't let you down. It's more of the same great harmonies and hair traffic out-of-controllness!Highlights include a serious cover of Thomas Dolby's Screen Kiss, When I Wake Up, On the Moon, and the comic relief of Boxes and Mr. Combination (big time shades of Demolotion). But they're all gems.About 2/3rds of the album are songs without drums, which leads me to believe that they were writing songs in their spare time and they just met up and threw them down on CD. An obvious side project. This is not a negative, since these guys have tons of talent, and it all comes through on swollen and tender!-2-Tim: Lose the girlie and go on tour with the 'jets!"
4,Great music!,I absolutely love this CD. I have a big selection of Christmas piano music and this is one of my favorites. Even my husband likes it. The only reason I gave it 4 stars is because the CD itself seems sub-par. It doesn't always play and the player reads (No Disk).
3,Not the best version,"I knew this little song from when I used to care for my nephews so when I had a daughter, searched it out. I find this board book version to be underwhelming- the pictures are not that bold or exciting. It's fallen flat so I'm going to see if I can get a better version of this story."
5,A big hit with a bed-jumping-monkey expert,"It was probably inevitable that we would get this book, since our daughter has loved the monkeys-on-the-bed rhyme since birth (Her first sentence was ""No more monkeys...."", accompanied by finger shaking.). The illustrations are what set this book apart--disheveled monkey kids, an increasingly exasperated monkey doctor and finally, in the surprise ending, a gleefully jumping monkey mom.Really, the only complaint I have about the book is that it's hard to curtail my monkey from jumping if I read it at bedtime!"
2,Not the most interesting book for babies,"My 9 month old has lots of favorite board books (Mirror Me, Pat the Bunny, Goodnight Moon, etc) and this has never been one of them. I think this book is a little too much for babies, although it sounds like toddlers really enjoy it. I guess we'll pull it out again in another six months or so!"
5,5 Little Monkeys is great!,I bought this book for a 2 year olds birthday. She loves the song and now we sing the song with the book while we see the pictures. She loves it!
2,Inconsistent flow to the story,"I love to read rhyming books to my one year old daughter. This story rhymes in the middle, but doesn't in the beginning or the end. So the story doesn't flow the way it should. If it rhymed throughout, I would give it five stars."
2,BORING!,"I was very disappointed in this book. I bought it (stupidly) without reading through it first for my son's first birthday. Although he doesn't (yet) mind the monotony of this book, I sure do. I was under the impression that it would have at least a little bit more of a plot than the childhood chant ""Five Little Monkeys Jumping on the Bed"". I was wrong, the book is the song in it's entirety, nothing more, nothing less."
1,Useless,"This book is boring, doesn't teach the child anything new (might as well just sing the easy lyrics), and the illustrations are dull. Waste of money!"
3,children's board books,"I love classic board books, and although these are the same stories, I prefer the lap version, which is about 10 inches or so big. I ordered this book and 3 others (including runaway bunny and going on a bear hunt), but they are the smaller board books (about 6 inches or less). Needless to say, I was disappointed that the description didn't have a size, which is my only complaint with the seller(s)"
2,Finger Book?,It is just not what I expected. There are place to put your finger but it is in the faces of the characters. So I don't see why you would want to put fingers in.
5,Hilarious!,"This is a terrific book. Any book my three year old cousin likes to have read to her more than once is a winner in my book. She's memorized the story to the point that she can recite it even without the book nearby. And she loves the pictures. We have a great laugh and a whole lot of fun whenever we read this book. It's a book that's also been used at a summer reading program I volunteered at one year, and the students thought it was great. They were ages 5-8. This book would be a great addition to a child's library."
4,reading and singing,"It'll be a good fun bedtime story for little ones, your children will love it. Reading and singing can be motivating to foreign students from 5 to 7, it can be used at a sleepover"
2,I cant finish it,"I also came across this book in the library,about a week ago. At first I was pleased with the book but now i find it continuely harder and harder to finish. I think maybe its just that the book is dated now, however I havent found it alot of help."
2,Not Many Highlights,"This video doesn't show that many game film highlights of Willie Mays. It's mostly Reggie Jackson interveiwing Willie. Willie suppose to be one of the best players in history, so for us who never seen him play, this video is a disappointment, we can't tell how great he was."
3,"Nice Concept, But...","Earring Rack Jewelry Organizer Holder OakThe Jewelry Organizer was flimsier than it looked in the photo. The earring racks, for example, are held to the frame by a single nail at each end, and are easier to come apart than I would have liked, especially since the item looks a little clunky. I bought it instead of another because it looked solid. Oh, well...The earring racks are made from flimsy plywood. The slots for the earrings are too close together, and are not for posts or regular ear wires, only for french ear wires (the longer ones that don't have a hook).The posts provided for necklaces don't have enlarged ends, and aren't slanted, so be careful of your necklaces. They can easily fall off.That being said, the ""Earring Rack Jewelry Organizer Holder"" does hold a lot of earrings, and if you are willing to hang several necklaces on the 4 posts provided for them, there is plenty of room."
4,Great pictures and facts,"This book reviews the history of the tiny town in Ohio that I grew up in. New Bremen, Ohio, might not be found on many maps, but Mark Bernstein covered its story from start to present. He starts by introducing the German immigrants who settled the village and continues up to the 1998 MAC Champion Boys Basketball Team. Go Cardinals! The topics covered include a wide range from World War II to the education at New Bremen Local Schools."
3,Not what I paid for,"I have contacted the seller and gotten NO response. DO NOT BUY THIS ITEM if you are looking for a collector's addition. It came with tons of knicks and scratches. It would look nice on the coffee table but since it's so beat up, I am too ashamed to put it out."
1,Worse than TV?,"It is a sad fact that a book of such immature and uncivilized quality as this one is being marketed to young children. I've always been a believer that books can be a safe, educational substitute to the sheer stupidity that defines the content of so many children's television shows nowadays, and that the bookstore is a place where children can find media suitable to social and moral growth. It turns out, however, that I'm wrong. It seems that even the children's section at the bookstore is a questionable place, where kids are not to be left alone for fear they may find something that would encourage rudeness and disrespect. I don't find it unreasonable to suggest that a book such as this one is partially to blame for the growing population of unruly children and adults alike. I would not advise anyone to buy this book."
5,Farts are funny.,"Some people pale when someone says ""fart,"" but we all fart. Farts are a fact of life. And while farts might not be the stuff of great literature, they are the stuff of belly laughts. I have several fart books on my shelves and ""...Bertie"" is one of the best. If you wanna read about the Big Bang of farts, try ""It All Began With a Bean,"" which tells the tall tale of when everyone and everything farted at once."
5,Hilarious book!,My five year old grandson adores this book! It is such a nice sound to hear him laugh as the book is being read to him and the reader laughs also! I highly recommend this book!
3,It's a short piece and fun to play on the piano.,"I bought this item to hear the melodys and phrasing. I have the sheet music and was interested in playing it. It's not a major work by itself. But, the entire collection is a historically creative masterpiece."
4,Fun,"This is another well made 12"" single. Although pressed on standard weight vinyl, it is a very good quality pressing. Here is the track listing...A1 (Berlin Mix by PvD & Alex M.O.R.P.H.) 6:58A2 (L.A. Mix) 6:37B1 Paul van Dyk & Giuseppe Ottaviani: Far Away 8:29"
5,Lots of good information,The author gives a get description of the kinds of trucks on the road today. It has great pictures with a lot of action. The author also takes you on a few trips were you get to meet the people who drive the trucks of America. This book is for young and old. If you drive a truck or you just like to look at them this is a book for you. Once I started I could not put it down. It is great!
3,Could be better,"The slick metal weaving makes items slide around and not stay in place. It does have rubber feet on he legs to keep the unit in place, but it is difficult to place items on the orgaqnizer where they will stay in place and not slide off.It ikind of more a pain than a help in my opinion."
4,Good product,"Replaced an old Badger with this unit. It is much quieter than previous disposal but not as quiet as I expected. I think InSinkErator makes a descent product but there may be other brands worth considering if the price is right. Installation was no problem, just follow the instructions. I deducted one star as I feel the noise level was a bit much for the price paid."
1,Worst garbage disposl on the face of the earth,"We bought this garbage disposal last November when we remodeled our kitchen. Didn't buy it from Amazon, but the thing is almost worthless. It won't grind up anything that isn't soft to begin with. I gave it one star because it works great for cat food, but it won't even grind up a lime - just chews it and then the rind keeps going round and round inside till you finally have to pull it out. We even called the company to complain and they sent out a service technician who was also surprised it wouldn't even handle a lime, so he replaced it with a new one (same model, unfortunately) and the new one is just as bad as the old one. Don't waste your money on this piece of junk. We wish we hadn't. You'll end up having to throw most everything in the trash rather than down the disposal. We're going to live with it as long as we can and then replace the stupid thing."
3,Not Especially Quiet,"Installs fast if you already had the Insinkerator collar, but all this talk about how quiet it is must be from people who had something pretty crummy in there before. It's nothing to write home about. My wife and I weren't sure if it was even quieter than the previous Insinkerator we had in there for the last 7 years."
1,not thrilled,"i replaced a worn out model#7, with this new unit, i agree it is super quiet, but what they don;t tell you is, if you have a sink with a thicker bottom, you need an adapter which costs an extra $80.00,the black ""stopper"" that you need to turn to start the disposer is nearly impossible to get right and engage the motor, plus it doesn't let water drain through it fast enough, especially when emptying a large pot--Lastly and most annoying is you have to push waste down into the unit with your hand, not something i like to do. 0h i miss my old #7."
2,Doesn't grind well,I bought this model expecting a really good disposer. It is well insulated but it does not grind well at all. You really need to be careful about what you put in it. I just put turkey bones in and it cannot handle the breast bone after a lengthy run. I fished it out.
3,Pleased.... generally,"Very very quiet compared to kenmore 3/4 hp we had. Plumber made comment about plastic connection points. Cheap he said. Also, one way they make it quiet is by designing the rubber flapper at the top stiff and sealed up pretty snug. This means you cannot shoot water at the thing and simply rinse all the debris into the disposer. You have to actually push it in with a utensil. Maybe this will relax a bit with age."
4,new disposer,"I own about 15 garbage disposers. This was very easy in install. Clean look, and ideal features. Proof will be in the durability but InSinkErator has great track record with me."
3,The Circus Fire 3 1/2 stars,"3 1/5 starsThe Circus Fire tells a few historical incidents of fire and panic in early twentieth century circuses, then O'Nan lends his narrative skills to the true story of a deadly blaze which struck the Ringling Bros circus big top on July 6, 1944. The historical characters are well-drawn, and O'Nan handles the mystery around the origin of the fire well.The glimpses into circus life, and the lives of the residents of Hartford Connecticut around the time of the fire are interesting. Some descriptive passages seem needlessly gruesome, but it is a book about a deadly fire."
4,Shocking account,"Very well written,many details but never boring...Made you want to keep reading and not put it down......"
4,Still Intrigued?,"I found Mr. O'Nan's work a compelling and at times, a gut-wrenching effort. I had always been mesmirized by that tragedy, especially about Little Miss 1565. Yet the emphasis of this tragedy is not just on her, there are others who were went unidentified in this tragedy and their sadness is also highlighted in this book. Mr. O'Nan does a good job of interconnecting the sub-plots in this tragedy and weaves together the lives of the victims in a very artful way. I am still intriqued about the arguments made by Mr. O'Nan regarding the identification of Eleanor Brooks so I will continue to read more on this subject. He definitely makes the story very real, yet surreal!"
2,Not very compelling,"As a historical text, Stewart O'Nan's ""The Circus Fire"" is OK, but to me it definitely was not ""brilliantly constructed"" as promised in the summary on the back of the book. The story itself is definitely a fascinating one and one and I for one am curious about the lack of a comprehensive history before O'Nan's. That aside, this book is so bogged down in a massive jumble of facts that it is difficult to follow in parts and I lost interest well before the end. If the author had concentrated on five or ten principal characters instead of 34+, this would have been a more compelling read. I realize that everyone involved has a story to tell, but it is hard to keep each person straight due to the sheer amount of people that O'Nan attempts to include."
1,NOT TOO GREAT,I AM IN THE PROCESS OF READING THIS BOOK RIGHT NOW. THE WRITING IS TRULY DISJOINTED AND SOME PARAGRAPHS HAVE TO BE REREAD TO COMPREHEND. IT'S NOT THE WORST BOOK I'VE READ OF THIS GENRE AND IT'S SOUNDS LIKE SOME OF THI IS BACK TO THE WRITERS UNSUAL STYLE...FICTION!!!!!
1,Convoluted and totally confusing....,"Mr. O'Nan should have taken a refresher course in basic writing. His skipping and skimming and throwing to and fro people, events, etc., is downright frustrating and confuses the project. Unlike superior literary treatments (see Walter Lord's A NIGHT TO REMEMBER about the TITANIC),this book leaveS you with more questions than anything else and the urge to take a long, hot shower. STILL, it is vastly superior to the other work about the Hartford Circus fire that is currently out there."
1,A tired recount of what we already knew.,"Where is the story here? Where is the hero? The book is just a rambling bunch of facts about the circus fire, and debatable facts at that. Where is Rick Davey's research? It seems to try to dispute Rick Davey, but there's no back up to that. All O'Nan tells us is what led everyone to believe for years that 1565 was NOT Eleanor Emily Cook, the old news. What information does Rick Davey have that counters this? It must be something substantial if the State of Connecticut exhumed the body and buried her with the Cook family. Perhaps part of the reason O'Nan's book is so poor because he does not know this information. On the first page O'Nan says he didn't even want to write the book. Why did he bother? Abysmal writing, pitiful structure. Matter of Degree by Rick Davey and Don Massey is going to knock this right over on its boring side."
4,Fascinatingly detailed,"The description of the fire as it travels from the sidewall across the big top is thorough, but not dull or boring. The author manages to tell a variety of stories that were all happening simultaneously. Occassionally I had to remind myself how compressed the time frame really was. While there is lots of information, and at times I lost track of who was who, this is a very compelling read and I had trouble putting the book down. The author balances the details of what happened; the who, where, when; with the stories of the people affected, telling a story that is intellectually and emotionally satisfying.Besides effectively covering the actual fire, the author does a great job of setting the scene and covering the chaos afterwards. I particularly appreciated the follow up ten and twenty years later with the continuing impact it had on some lives."
2,scratching the surface,"The analysis described in the book is a start for an individual investor to do their own research and it points to some useful resources. But the depth of the analysis and process is not enough. Following this process would not be sufficient to replace an analysis by a professional analyst, provided the analyst is objective. In other words, one can not ""fire the stock analyst"" simply by following what the book says.Some criteria mentioned in the book are also abitrary, superficial. For example, it says slow growth would be sales growth of 30% or less. A sustainable of sales growth of 30% is extraordinary in real life. The book also gives different processes for growth and value investors, where growth and value should be integral parts of any analysis."
4,recorded from a seat in audience,"A glorious performance. The recording was made from a noisy audience seat, it seems; the artifacts can distract. Voices are far away, then in your face. Anyone who knows the 1947 Toscanini Otello (restored at pristine audio) will understand that nothing can touch its lightning; the opera unfolds as a single breath. So, that is the recording to start with -- but probably after seeing the opera on DVD (perhaps Karajan's)."
2,I had fond memories...,"... of Freddy Quinn's Christmas albums; they were a must in my family when I was a little girl. Unfortunately, as an adult I find these arrangements from the 60s unbearable. It sounds as if the only instrument used here was a synthesizer. - Terrible!"
5,Best One Out There,"Vaughan has written a super book with much to offer. She essentially presented integral psychology with this book in that it integrates body, emotions, mind and spirit. She uses many of the concepts of Ken Wilber's earlier works, but unlike him, she is not merely a theorist. She has been a psychotherapist for many years, and allows the reader to choose for themselves what is true. Refreshingly, she does not have an agenda like so many writers, except for one to discover who they are at a deep level in their own way. This book is probably the best applied book in transpersonal and integral psychology available. If you have to own only one book, this is that book."
4,"Good Philosophy, For What That's Worth","Michael Lynch's ""True to Life"" makes the case that truth is objective and that a concern for truth is necessary to a good human life. As Lynch notes, nothing is more certain than the fact that humans make mistakes -- and the possibility of mistake proves that the world is independent of our beliefs.""True to Life"" is short, readable, and wise. However, I'm unsure whether anyone untainted by post-modernism would find it necessary to defend the reality or value of truth. Reading the book mainly left me wondering why anyone bothers to read or write analytic philosophy at all -- and wishing that I had read ""Going After Cacciato"" instead (Lynch uses Tim O'Brien's novel to illustrate the importance of knowing what is truly important to us)."
2,Odd,"The copyright is 2005, that many years after a man arrived who said he was the way, the truth, and the life and who said, under what for you and me would be great duress, that he came into the world to testify to the truth and that everyone on the side of truth listened to him. Wiggenstein, Satre, Bertrand Russell, they're all here, though they will be soon forgotten. Odd that a book on truth and which ventures beyond the observations of the scientist would omit treatment of the man whose life, death, and, many believe, resurrection dates the very book written. Isn't that still the only question: ""Who say you is Christ?"""
5,The little soul in us...,"In this world of stress and kaos comes a CD that is gentle, spiritual, and relaxing. We play it almost every night in our house as a going to bed routine. After baths, and nightclothes, we turn off the lights and play the little soul and the sun. My daughter loves this CD, she sings the songs even when the CD is not playing. And recently she has started to imitate the conversation with God when she is in her room alone. If she had things her way it would be the only thing we would listen to. As for adults, It has taken me to places inside myself i thought were lost. It has brought a person to the surface i thought no longer existed. And as you listen it to it time and time again, you notice the conversation is never the same, and you are always picking up on something new that you never heard the time before. This CD is a wonderful addition to anyone's collection. Even if you only listen to it once, it will enrich your life, and renew your spirit."
1,A highly disappointing experience,We tried to watch this movie tonight.It was a gift to my wife who was so moved by this show when we first saw it that she learned to play the piano and has practised for years so she could be popular in the nursing home too.She is greatly disappointed.I can't rate it because we couldn't watch it.Amazon did not notify me that I could no longer return it. I discovered this one week after I requested return info only by reviewing my previous 6month's of orders.
5,Excellent Book,"I read this book not knowing what to expect but I found it not only to be informative about Powell's life from the beginning but it also gives inside information on the major political, war, and social events that have happened since the mid-50's. Powell tells the real story of what really happened in the Iran/Contra affair, the cold war end during the Reagan years and many other behind the scenes events in our nations recent history. Very impressive."
5,Excellent. A must read for those who want to lead.,"This book should be standard fare in U.S. schools on ""How to live your life and be successful"". The name of the book should be: ""Colin Powell an American Hero"". What is America waiting for? Powell for President. NM"
3,It wasn't signed like indicated in the product description,"I bought this book for my stepdad for Christmas and was excited when the product description said that it was a signed first edition. When it arrived, however, it was not signed and we looked through the entire book to try to find it. The description was very misleading and I'm afraid, was only labeled that way for a sale."
1,Pulling the Wool over your Eyes,"I just don't get this great big love affair with Colin Powell. I didn't know much about him except from CNN before I read this book, but now I just don't like him much. Basically he's a commander more interested in his troop's welfare than in accomplishing a mission. That's not so bad, you say, generals should worry about their subordinates. The problem is that his missions go awry (Somalia), his advice is often wrong (Bosnia), or he steals credit for others' accomplishments (Iraq). I don't understand why folks are so mesmerized by the fact that he's black and came from New York. Powell comes across in his own book as ambitious, duplicitous, self-serving. The consummate inside-the-beltway bureaucrat."
2,Lacking the Normal Excitement Anticipated From a US Hero,"Colin Powel is clearly a great American as exemplified among his many accomplishments and life experiences. However, this presentation of his life story is arduous and without excitement. This book often presents itself more like an encyclopedia entry than an insightful biography. While equal blame may lay on my view of Powel's somewhat humdrum life as much as the writing style of this book, I believe this book will only be of interest to those already seeking to research Powell's life, not those in search of an enthralling piece."
1,Weak and Dishonest,"Colin Powell is a politician. Figure it out. Like most politicians he uses his book to hide his flaws, backstab his enemies (even those who have passed away), smarm up to his friends and potential allies, and spin his career for public consumption. It was Powell whose decisions led to those boys deaths in Somalia. It was Powell who failed to go after Saddam. It was Powell who didn't even see any reason to attack Iraq, though Saddam would have controlled the majority of the oil in the entire world. It was Powell who was willing to blithely condemn thousands of Bosnian citizens to rape, torture, and murder.Powell is a politician, and if this book is so transparent, why is there still a cult of personality around this vain dishonest man?"
4,Entertaining,"You can't help but like this man whether you agree with him or not. This was a book about a man who jumped on most of the opportunities in life that came his way. What I enjoyed most about this book was his sharing his experiences being stationed in the south (Fort Benning, Georgia) in the early 1960's, mentioning that heading north to New York you had to have a strong bladder if you were black. What I admire most about Colin Powell is that, though he made it to the top as a soldier, he put his time in the trenches & combat. Politically we're different. He's a progressive Republican & an internationalist. I'm more of a populist. Howevwer, I feel he does what he believes is right, and, in the best interest of this nation"
3,Interesting book about an interesting man,"Colin Powell is a many-faceted, intelligent man. He is also quite modest. I'd decided to read this book mainly because I wanted to know more about our current Secretary of State. I usually don't care for biographies about figures still living and I fully expected not to finish this one, however Powell's story about his rise from the streets of the Bronx to the White House captivated me.My only quibble was that I found his time spent on Army commands much more fascinating than the time spent in the White House. Powell himself tried throughout his career to remain in command of troops but he kept being pulled back to Washington because of the excellent job he could do. The book may have suffered just a bit from bloat but on the whole I found it an interesting study of a good man."
5,fascinating,"Reading about the 'journey' of this dedicated, ambitious, focused, thoughtful, centered man has been fascinating. The stories are insightful and the words of wisdom which occasionally punctuate them are succinct and real."
5,Great story of a great individual!,"I purchased this for my Kindle and have since shared it with two other family members and they both agree that this is one great story of a great man. I would vote for him in an instant for president, but he is not interested, too bad for the country!"
5,A Terrific and Valuable Little Pamphlet!,"While short and sweet, it's a pity this little pamphlet is not more widely available, especially to students, writers, and researchers of anything involving L&C.;This fantastic little booklet reprints the letter that the Captains had left on the coast, and the eventual amazing history of one copy of it! Maybe they weren't 100% sure they'd ever make the trip back?! This is the kind of wonderful ""nugget trivia"" that had passed by me in reading the Journal itself.This little pamphlet is focused, of course, on the stay at the coast. Excellent maps are shown, both original and modern. I had not realized, nor ever heard before, what the historical society had actually found in that area, and when. Totally fascinating!This is the ONLY source I've ever seen that gives the names of numerous rivers and other features, as L&C; named them, as the Indians named them, and as they are currently named today!Highly recommended and very, very valuable!"
2,Not satisfied,Purchased a Hitachi NV45AB2 from Amazon. Used two different compressors (4 gal 1 hp CH extreme and a 20 gal Sanborn 5 hp) at various pressures up to 115 psi. But had to hand set about every third nail while applying Corning 40 year shingles. Returned the nailer to Amazon for a second Hitachi NV45AB2 nailer but still had the same problem. Lent the nailer to my son who uses a third brand of compressor (dual tank but don't know the brand). He reported the same problems applying composite siding but said it seem to get better with use. First Hitachi I bought based upon my son's experience with other Hitachi products and its reputation. Don't think I'd purchase another one.
5,Awesome nailer,"I researched several roofing nailers and based my decision on the reviews I read about the Hitachi. I have shingled two roofs so far and have had zero problems. The second roof I did was for a friend and he helped with his Poter Cable nailer. It was picky about the nails that were used, jamed often and had no depth setting. The Hitachi kept plugging along and never missed a beat. The depth setting was crucial for the different situations when installing shingles. After years of hammering nails and seeing other guns in action, I highly recommend the Hitachi NV45AB2."
4,Does Hitachi Test before shipping,The Nailer I received would not advance to the next nail. The problem was solved by repositioning the piston cover. There was no rust or contamination on the parts. I assume that this was a one of kind problem. Everything else about the nailer appears to be of the quality expressed in the reviews.
2,Great for the first 10 Seconds,"This torch was great for the first 10 seconds. It was easy to fill, a nice size and weight, but once I tried using it, it was all down hill. The torch will not stay on even when you use the lock. It will stay on for about 10-20 seconds at a time, which is really frustrating when you're trying to brown anything. At first I thought it was the angle I was holding it, or that the fuel level wasn't high enough. Nothing I have tried seems to solve the problem. I will be looking to buy a different brand. Steer clear of this torch. It's more frustration than it's worth."
2,92 Queens Road,"The main character of the book is Kathy. The book is based on her experience with segregation. It takes place in South Africa in the 1960's. I didn't like this book because it didn't have enough information about the about the characters. It also was confusing because there was two parts in the book like in the middle of the book it said part 2. You might like this book if you liked Albatross Winter, or Love, David."
5,great movies,I like all the movies except the 4th..they really streched it for this 1..I beleive they also made a 5th to the franchise..but I can't rememberall in all they were very funny movies
4,Luck of the Irish,I very vaguely recall seeing the first one on video in the 80s. It was better than I recalled. I am glad there are sequels. Each movie was enjoyable. They are definately worth the money. I reccomend them.
2,Bad bad movies,For some reason these movies seemed funny and good when I was a kid. Watching the dvds now is like pulling teeth. Luckily I only paid $5 for this but then again I still fell like I paid too much.
1,Disappointing..,"I'm a true fan of the first Leprechaun movie. Warwick Davis and Jennifer Aniston really make this film great. The humor interlaced with the story is hilarious. A true cult classic. Obviously filmed on a limited budget, the characters are written with some decent depth. As much depth as would be expected anyways. Believing that the sequels would be worth the cost of buying the boxed set, I purchased them. Sadly mistaken, I wasted my money. 2-5 are some of the worst written movies I've ever seen. Not to mention you don't recognize a single actor until Part 5 where Ice-T and Coolio come into play. They're ...not worth buying. Buy the original. Love it, watch it often. Rent the rest. And be glad you saved your money."
3,lol someone told me to buy this if i was into horror,"whether its scary or good old fun, its gotta be entertaining, as a kid i never saw these cause i was into childs play, friday the 13th and freddy, candy man etc, but for the price for 4 being so cheap, i wondered and the person who recommended acted like it held some sort of substance but the 1st one was so-so, 2nd one, eeehhhh lol, the 3rd one wasnt feeling it and i havent seen the fourth but if your looking for a really corny horror movie with jennifer annistan being in the first one and 3 others for 5 or 6 dollars and your collecting horror films and thats spare change to you, id say go for it but really, i dont think id recommend it to anybody. not to mention i saw the leprechaun in the hood as the first one before these and i just think this type of horror is just a slap stick humor combination with corny horror, if your into it, check it out."
2,Leprechaun Collection,"The Leprechaun series on dvd. Includes Leprechaun, Leprechaun 2, Leprachaun 3, Lepreachaun 4: In Space, and Leprechaun in the hood. I don't like the stupid first installment. In it, the leprachaun terroizises a group of people after one of his coins is taken. In the second one, He trys to find a love intrest. Leprachaun 3 has him visit Las Vagas to reclaim more of his coins. Leprechaun in space is pretty self explainatory. Leprachaun in the hood, leprachaun the rapper? Not exactly a great collection, but you've got to watch them sometime."
1,She's come a long way...,Too comical to be scary... Jennifer looks very young and it really didn't do her any justice. No real credibility for me as a viewer.
3,Great Fun on St. Pat's Day,"My husband always wanted to do a Leprechaun Marathon where we had a corned beef and cabbage luncheon and watched leprechaun movies all afternoon. So that's what we did and the silliness was great. Also really enjoyed seeing Jennifer Aniston in this role with the 80's outfit. This first movie was best, and yes we watched all of them. All around funny."
4,Great series,"I only gave it 4 because the movies went downhill, pretty evenly. But don't most sequels? The first one ruled just so much, and the other ones after that were going from good to okay to all right to just ""eh, I love this series, but this movie isn't as good."" It is just a psychological viewpoint that we use to judge sequels before they truly get a chance."
3,The Descent from Hilarity to Mediocrity,"The Leprechaun series are classics on line with the best of B horror. Starting with an original idea, the four films represent a streaming storyline that is original in each movie, but leads from a little creepy to truly cliche. The horror, however, always plays second fiddle to the humor. This series will always be good for a MST3K-like watch with friends."
4,2 Discs,This is a 2 disc version. Disc 1 has 1 and 2 on same side. Disc 2 has 3 on one side and 4 on the other. Haven't watched yet so no clue on special features.
2,It's not a pot o' gold at the end of this rainbow,Very funny in that bad film sort of way. It was a lot of fun to see Jennifer Aniston early in her career.
2,"All Full Screen, not 1.85:1 as listed","These are great camp classic films. Unfortunately this set is just a rehash of Trimark's previous releases. ALL are full screen 1.33:1, not widscreen 1.85:1 as the Amazon listing currently reads (01-15-11). The first film has never been available in wide, but I'm pretty sure the others have. Kind of sucks to limit us to full in this day and age when wide is the standard."
1,Damaged in shipment?,"The bike I ordered wouldve been a great Christmas present had it not been dropped a few hundred times before I received it, both fenders damaged badly, and paint scraped off the frame in 3 spots."
3,Pretty good for the price,"I've had this bike for 2 and a half month now. Its has been working fine for me. This bike doesnt have too good quality though. My pedals broke after a month, and some screws have fallen off under the sadel. I need the pump the tires maybe once every 3rd week. It is also pretty heavy, so its tough to carry up for stairs. The things that broke is not a huge deal, it still works fine.This is a cheap bike, that im not very worried for getting stolen, and that also looks pretty cool.. I would recomend it for you who want a bike just for shorter rides and are planing to have it for no more than 2 years. But if you are looking for a good quality bike that you plan to ride every day for the next 5-6 years, you should look on an other bike."
3,good cruiser but....,"I purchased this cruiser for my commute to work and get around town in New York City (14 miles a day!). Its heavy, so hills are always a challenge. The fenders are cheap so I had mine replaced. I also changed the saddle - It broke down after the first month. I replaced it with a Selle Royal cruiser seat. I added a rack & also replaced the pedals. It is a stylish cruiser and I after 3 months to this date I love my bike Heavy as it is - I enjoy my rides everytime...If you need a bike for less, this one works fine, but You must understand that parts have to be replaced for it to work best."
2,"Cheap, cheap, cheap","This bike is cheap in several senses of the word. I got mine at Wal-mart fully assembled and I quickly noticed that the tires were wobbly and bent. When I went back to get the problem fixed, I noticed a couple returning their Cranbrook because a pedal had broken off. Despite my misgivings, I kept the bike because the price was right. Within a few weeks, the bike rusted and its tires slowly deflated. If I had to do it over again, I would avoid this bicycle."
1,Don't waste your money,"This bike breaks often. I wanted the cheapest thing to putt around on, but buying this was a mistake. It was delivered with bent rims, but whatever, it only cost me $100 and I just want to pedal on the beach path. But this breaks all the time (pedal broke off after a month, tubes in tires went flat after a couple b/c of the crappy chinese builders made rims with uneven and sharp interiors...too many other things to list. Spend the extra $50/100 and get something that is NOT huffy."
1,Huffy Cranbrook Men's Cruiser Bike's chain is defective,"There is a major flaw with the Cranbrook Men's bicycle: the bicycle chain is defective. On the second time I took the bike out for a ride on a straight, paved path, the chain popped off, causing me to lose my brakes (fortunately I was not close to the busy intersection). I fixed the chain right there and after riding for a few blocks, the chain popped off again. Again I fixed it and again the chain popped off further down the path. I lost my brakes about 8 times during a four mile bike ride. I thought the problem was isolated to just my bike but my brother, who coincidentally bought the same make and model a couple of years ago, told me that he too had the same problem. Huffy should fix this defect on their Cranbrook bicycle with a recall before someone gets hurt."
2,quantity but not enough quality,"I was disappointed in this book. It contains tons of limericks but the vast majority were apparently written to fill a numbers quota, rather than for cleverness or quality. The ""Limericks: Too Gross"" by Asimov and Ciardi was also disappointing. If you want pure knee-slapping raunchiness and clever word play go for ""the Paris edition of THE LIMERICK."" Both writer and editor are anonymous. It's inexpensive and has all the classics as well as many great ones you likely haven't heard."
5,Kung Fu Panda,"Loved, loved, loved this collection of all three Kung Fu Panda movies. The product arrived promptly and was in excellent condition. Great quality item."
5,Excellent Value,"The two main movies are quite good and have been extensively reviewed, so I will not add to those reviews. Rather, I will focus on the fact that this is a good value: you get both films as well as a nicely done bonus short. Well worth the price."
5,The Replay button will become broken with this movie,"Have you ever watched a movie where you had to watch it again multiple times within a day or a week, well I got Kung Fu Panda fever. I love this movie, great character development, plot and ending that makes a father and son want to cry together. And it sets up the movie perfectly for a sequel. Four more from what I heard. The replay button will become broken from me watching a rewatching this great movie."
1,KungFu Panda 2 audio problems,The audio for Panda 2 will randomly cut out. To fix it we have to restart the movie. Very annoying. Amazon will only provide a partial refund and we have to pay shipping. Not worth it. Amazon is usually great but very disappointed in this purchase and with Amazons lack of customer service for this product.
4,Summer problems for the lifeguards!,This book wasn't the best LIFEGUARD book but it was good anyway. I think Ryan was wrong to start drinking again just because Elizabeth didn't show up for their date. He also dumped Liz and started to date Jessica which I thought wasn't very nice to do. The ending of the book was quite unexpected and it left me wondering what would happen next in the next summer series!
4,Great Contributors to Education,Mathematicians can be amazing people and are great contributors to society and education. What is really nice about this book is it doesn't use a lot of mathematical jargon when it tells about the lives of famous mathematicians. It is more like a series of biological sketches on each one. This is a very enjoyable read!
4,Hard to pick 60,"To balance length of book, number of mathematicians, details of subjects is difficult. In general I think the author did a good job. But I did miss not seeing Paul Erdos included"
4,Good book,This book is a collection of short biographies of notable mathematicians from Euler to von Neumann. It does a good job of explaining both a mathematicians background and the significance of their contributions to mathematics. Great to read through or as a reference to have on the shelf.
3,it's just ok,"I read this book a few months ago. I thought it got kind of stale by the end, they way the author presents the information is fine, but I think that after a while the biographies start to run together. The mathematicians start to fall in similar types, like the mathematician who was famous and didn't have many problems who overshadowed a brilliant mathematician who fell into obscurity. You do learn a lot of information about the mathematicians themselves, but I think that the book could have been better with less mathematicians, or more important famous ones (extend the time frame)."
2,"protects well, looks bad","fit nicely, and provides decent protection, but the cover looks beat up in just a few days. The outer layer 'peels', so if you don't mind your phone looking like an old Desoto that lived through a lot of Detroit winters, I guess it is OK."
3,different but okay,"it seems like a huge Limp Bizkit rip off and we all know there are too many of those. But these guys seem to put a lot of heart into it. I was a little weary of purchasing this album but after awhile I decided to just go ahead and do it. I don't regret it but some of you out there are pretty picky about your music, so watch your step."
3,Revielle,"hello Music Fans. Well every once and awhile a band comes along that when you firsy hear them they make your head spin. Ok so revielle may just be one of those bands. I am sure this cd will be in the ""related"" section with alot of other rap rock and nu metal stuff. Although their style is a little different yes you may file them under just another korn or limp bizkit rip off, But here is the kicker=============IF you a skpetic buy ""laced"" their first disk, Then I dare you to compare these Harvard Ma boys to anything you have heard before. yes this is a review for ""blled the sky"" but I urge you to buy ""laced"". Then go ahead and buy this album. Drew sure knows how to get peoples blood rushing and The first single off This record ""What you got"" will leave you feeling good knowing that ""whatyou got"" is a really good cd"
3,russel ford...,"WTF are you talking about man!?are you comparing a kid's band like reveille(or limp, korn or any other of those lame a$$ bands)to rage against the machine?!...and I THINK!i've read that you would give tom morello the day off to replace him for james hettfield?(master of puppets or not)..look man...you're obviously insane in the brain like b real said once...reveille is a good band indeed...)personally i prefer ""laced"" over ""bleed..."")but to compare it to RATM...hehehe...c'mon!and to take tom out of the ecuation!...please don't ever be a producer bro!hahahaha..."
2,same old,This sounds like the same old bull that we are tired of hearing from bands like Limp Bizkit. For anyone to even think of comparing them to Rage against the machine is unthinkable. Rage's accomplishments in rock have earned them a place as one of the top bands of all time. Reveille isn't a pimple on their a$$.
1,Yuck ! Horrible band !,Its what you get if you mix limp bizkit and linkin park. The rhymes are all the same thing and the singer it looks like a copy of fred durst. Dont waste your money on this crap they suck ass big time.
5,epitome of hard rock,"these guys have come out of nowhere with a near perfect album.amazing vocals, lyrics, drum lines, melodies and programming make 'bleed the sky' an epic classic modern hard rock album. it gets my vote as one of the best hard rock albumss of the 90s. i'd rank it up with Korn's album ""Issues"". This is truly a breakthrough band that I am excited about hearing their future workdon't think twice, buy this album. if you love Korn, POD, Linkin Park, Taproot... you need this album."
2,What Happened!?,"What happened to the Reveille that put out ""Laced."" They've really dumbed-down their sound to please the masses. Their first album was so much heavier and more original. It featured great bass lines and guitar riffs. The technicality of their music has gone way down,and the vocals... Drew used to be so much more original; on the new album, he sometimes sounds like he's actually making an effort to imitate the talentless Fred Durst. He even rips off the great Chino Moreno's signature screams. They went from being a great original hardcore/nu-metal act into a run-of-the-mill rapcore band. Maybe the Papa Roach/Linkin Park crowd will get into this one."
5,Reveille,"The new album is great. Its a little more rap oriented then Laced, but as always, Reveille pulls through with a great album. Definetely pick it up."
2,Life lessons,"This is the absolute last time i will ever buy a CD based on hearing one song. My taste may be different from others, but ""What you got"" is the only decent song on the album in my opinion. I can't tell you to stay away in good conscience, but i HIGHLY recommend that you youtube a preview of the tracks or something before you take the plunge."
4,Great But Not There Original Sound,"Ive been a fan of revielle for awhile ever since there first album came out, in which they sounded like a very heavy R.A.T.M (Rage Against the Machine) with a slight religous side to it (kinda antichrist) This album is good but not as good as the first one, theres alot of catchy tunes but its more of a change from the begining, maybe better for some but its more of a Primer 55/Slaves on Dope change, which isnt nearly as bad as the change of Limp Bizkit or Staind(what the F**K were they thinking?) i got this album when released because of previous knowledge of them, but a little dissapointed at first, they still have a metal-rap to them but are more for chorus and vocals in this album. if your a fan pick it up or listen first but you shouldent be too dissapointed, and if not and are into the new sound of apartment26, Spineshank, or simular you will like this album. all in all check it out if you havent yet"
2,Limp bizkit wannabe's...,"Thats pretty much what I have to say...no future for this guys, no originality, sound really boring..."
4,Good Rap/Rock,I saw these guys in concert with Sevendust and they were incredible so I went out and got their CD. The lead singer's voice is ok but fits their music to a T.
2,Disappointed,"The ISI guides as a series are a really great concept which bring us in touch with a lost part of our identity as a civilization. In as much as that that is the goal of this essay length book, it has merit. I bought the entire set and they are each quite unique. The fact that someone has even written a ""guide to liberal learning"" itself has merit in our age of deconstruction. On the other hand, this one lacks lucidity. It reads more like the ramblings of someone who likes to read a lot of obscure books, than a ""guide to liberal learning""The key points of the essay are as follows:1. Read.2. You haven't read anything if you've only read it once.3. Have a personal library.4. You can reading start anywhere, because that will lead you to the next place.5. Random book recommendations.Points were fine, but the writing style didn't flow easily and it might have been better entitled ""An approach to reading."""
3,The brief introduction,"It is quite a brief introduction to liberal learning. However, my idea of liberal learning lies within the focus of being free and the ability to contemplate life. If that is what that means, then this is a great guide to liberal learning. It also gives you suggestions on what to read and anything that seems to positively mention Plato, Socrates, and Aristotle -- well... that defintely means that it's worth reading!"
2,A Jesuit's narrow introduction to a narrow bibliography,"As a passionate supporter of liberal education, I looked forward to receiving this book with relish to give to my youngest who--while at a highly rated university--I realize still doesn't have a clue about artes liberales. So I must say I was crestfallen to discover this guide was so limited and disappointing, with such a sectarian and limited bibliography, authors, however good in themselves, so much of one ""camp"" that it is travesty to hold it up as a good selection of the best books out there as guides to ""liberal learning"".Further, Amazon does its users no service not to make the author's status as a priest and affiliation with the Society of Jesus more evident. This book should have been title ""A Roman Catholic Student's Guide to Liberal Learning""."
2,...,"I couldn't believe that this was the book I wanted for so long. It was...oi vey...Naughty Girl - This was a sweet story, kind of cute. However, the fact that she'd been abused and was trying to make herself believe she was a ""dirty"" girl was not realistic, and huge turn-off.Wanted: One Hot-Blooded Man - I don't know what Britton was thinking when she wrote this. It was quite disturbing. When you are raped, you don't suddenly want to have a lesbian experience. This was just so wrong is so many places - the whole story was a terrible description of mental trauma, and not at all realistic.Have Mercy - Not even gonna go into how ridiculous this story was.Reno's Choice - If this had been a little longer I might have liked it. But Raven was so angry. She also dressed kind of...well, skanky, for a virgin. And Reno was a little too arrogant and dominant for me.As hot as the sex scenes were, the lack of...everything else vitally important in a story was too much to overlook."
4,Honk If You Love Real Men,I love alpha males. Honk If You Love Real Men is filled with sizzling alpha males. A great read. A keeper.
4,Honk If You Love Real Men,"If you are a fan of Lora Leigh you will love ""Reno's Chance"", her portion of this book."
4,Hot times....,"Enjoyable short stories that heat the blood. I liked every one, and will re-read them."
5,My wife is the user,"My wife is a musician and plays a variety of instruments, including the piano and the hammered dulcimer. I got her this Kalimba for Mother's Day and she loves it. These are small, hand held instruments with an interesting sound. I read the reviews on several of these and decided on this one because 1) positive reviews; 2) number of keys (shows my knowledge of music, I suppose); and 3) price. The bottom line for me is that my wife is happy. Let me add that 8th Street had this to my door within a few days. I have not had much good luck with Amazon Marketplace vendors. I have had slow delivery and no delivery in the past. This was a great experience. I'm glad I bought it."
5,Not as powerful as a large framing nailer,"This is an excellent siding and framing nailer, however it is not as powerful as a Hitachi NR83A framing nailer, which has a substantially larger air chamber for driving nails. In most cases this nailer is great for framing; its compact size allows you to face-nail and toe-nail easier in tight spaces. However, when nailing a .131 x 3"" framing nail into two pieces of old growth fir 2x (not as common of scenario these days unless you reuse materials from demolitions on the West coast), the nail will often sit proud about an inch or more. The Hitachi NR83A will usually sink the nail in this scenario, albeit sometimes the nail may sit about a 1/4"" proud."
2,No Warranty,"Do not buy this product online because there is no warranty for the product, except for those sold by an installer.Although the Master is still working the mutiply CD player went bad in six months it was then I learnt about the warranty issue. So please watch out."
5,Sounds Great!,"Installed on 12' F150 5.0. Very pleased with this muffler! I had Midas install it (hour and a half). The installer moved the muffler back about 2"" from where the original was and sleeved the exhaust from the muffler forward to the cats to lower the sound inside the truck. I had a 07 Mustang gt before this truck and to be honest this muffler made the exhaust sound better and louder than the stock exhaust I had on my Mustang. Deep aggressive sound."
5,A daughter's perspective.,"Outback and Beyond: The travels of Sidney and Cynthia Nolan, is five travel books slightly condensed into one. Off the beaten track travels across Australia (1949), New Guinea, Africa, China (1965) and the USA (1958). Wonderful descriptions, commentary and observations by the writer Cynthia with thoughtful and sometimes rye comments quotes from her husband. Kenneth Clark, art historian, remarked that Cynthia Nolan was one the best travel writers of her time. Unfortunately the book is out of print but worth a good search."
5,great comp,"This is a German-produced collection. For all Sweet's popularity in Britain, they achieved their greatest success in Germany. This collection focuses on their singles. Some of the other reviewers lament the non-inclusion of album tracks such as ""Sweet F.A."". Yes, the album tracks in general are not much represented here. But lots and lots of singles are, including the really early ones, like ""Funny, Funny"" and ""Co-Co"" from way back in 1971."
3,A book of Reviews,I used this book as a text book for the last class I took at college. This was the highest level class and the book should have been a little more challenging. The book was great at reviewing everything that I had done in my entire college studies. But the book lacked in the area of taking the knowledge and applying it to everyday life. I would use this book again but I would try and find a way to apply more of it the the business world.
4,An interesting book arranged logically.,This book has been a helpful resource in knowing more about business and strategy. The illustrations helped to make the material clearer. The outline of the book made study somewhat easier. I feel that I am better prepared for my future career after reading and studying this book.
4,An overall good book,"This book was fairly easy to read. It's organization provides an easy-to-follow guide to business strategies. One thing that I didn't like about the book was the graphs and charts. However, I did like the tables that gave short summaries of the chapters, and I found the opening and closing cases very helpful in applying the subject matter to the business world."
4,A Review on Strategic Management Theory,"I am a student at Hannibal LaGrange College and we are using Strategic Management Theory in our senior level class.I find it to be very informative and it is easy to read and understand. I appreciate the in-depth explanations of various terminology. The summaries at the end of each chapter are helpful when reviewing for exams.Also, the case studies help to put the information into better perspective. They give me a better understanding of how the subject matter relates to organizations in the real world.The charts, graphs and pictures are helpful in understanding the content of the material.I also appreciate the fact that the textbook is not huge and weighted down like most textbooks."
4,Strategic Mangement Theory an Integrated Approach,"I am a senior in college and this book is the one that we at using in Business Strategy class. My general reaction is that the book has good content and it is easy to understand. There is some color that helps the reader enhance the content. The chapter overview is at the beginning of each chapter, this helps the reader outline the material. The book is lacking graphs and charts. But it makes up for it in the end of chapter cases. I would rate the illustrations as good, and the content is good as well. This book compares successfully with other college level books. Some of the material is outdated, but the next addition will probably make up for that."
3,Good but Not Great Guide - Much Missing,"I bought this book because we travel extensively and wanted a good guide to help us find Catholic sites in the US. I was disappointed however to find some of our favorite sites (e.g. Shrine of Christ's Passion, St John, IN, Shrine of the Little Flower, Darien, IL) not listed. Descriptions given are well written but much is missing. Pretty disappointed in lack of completeness."
4,A very reliable travel book.,"I think it is a great reference book. They could have added some more Cathedrals and other sites into the collection. But overall, you won't be disappointed. I know I wasn't."
1,Black Magic Woman,FALSE ADVERTISING!! WHAT YOU GET IS NOT WHAT IS SHOWN!! DON'T TOUCH THIS WITH A TEN-FOOT POLE!!
1,"Terrible, cheap, and definitely not 'New'","Wow, what a ripoff. The comb was definitely used although it was supposed to be new, and it had sharp, raised, seams along the inside of each 'bristle' which are sure to rip your hair when you use it. Threw it right in the trash."
4,great detangler comb,only reason i gave this product 4 stars was because the teeth on the comb are hard and a little sharp (but i'm tender headed so i'm not sure if that has something to do with it?) Product arrived a day early than exspected and was in great condition and original packaging.
3,Arrived Broken,"It was shipped in an envelope and broken when arrived. They don't offer to replace it, so my impression must be based on the item I have. Flimsy, brittle prongs and poor packaging."
4,Pretty good,"I bought this with high hope of untangling my snarls. With curly hair it can be a hard feat, and this did okay. You do need to work with it a bit,if that is your case also. For hair that isn't prone to being one giant knot, I would say this would be magic, and save you a step. I'll still use it, and hopefully get better at it. One thing I will say is that the teeth have a bit of give, so it didn't tear my hair out as much."
5,A must have for long hair,"Just got this comb and I love it. I've always liked to brush my hair after a shower but lately I've been afraid that I'm ripping my hair out. This comb solves that problem. Use this comb with Beyond the Zone Leave in Conditioner and this comb works as an in and out of shower detangler. Overall a must have for long, curly or thick hair."
1,Too cheap!,"The prongs on this comb are cheap machine made plastic that is actually too sharp and scratchy to the touch to put through hair. Always test a new comb on your hand, and if it scratches your hand then it will cut at your hair strands damaging them. If you have short hair this would be fine because the sharpness is high up in the comb, but for mid back length heavy hair these teeth will absolutely ravage your hair. Sometimes you truly do get what you pay for so I suggest the wenn shower comb instead - it's excellent for thick or fine hair alike and it's extremely well made."
5,Best detangler for my thick coily hair,I love this comb and I have bought it 2x; once because I lost it and one because it was stolen.It has never broken and it is flexible and sturdy. I have thick natural hair that is very curly kinky nappy whatever you want to say. This comb gets through my naps with ease. Yes I have to comb my hair while it is wet soaking in conditioner but this comb is still the only one that doesn't pull or hurt. The rounded tips are soft on my scalp. I use it on my daughters hair too to detangle and her hair is thin with a looser curl but this comb still does great with the no more tears part of doing her hair.
5,Tangle free is the way to be!,"The Mebco Tortoise Shower Detangler is the first shower comb I've ever bought. I have naturally curly, long color treated hair. I have a lot of knots and damage. Using this comb leaves my hair in the best condition it has ever been in! No frizzies! It's AMAZING to say the least! It's easy to use, detangles wonderfully and gently and with considerable ease. It is durable and attractive which is a bonus! I'm so glad that I decided to buy this comb. I will never be without again!"
3,good,This comb doesn't detangle my hair all that great like i thought i would but it works good on my daughter's hair.
2,Pan was hard to clean.,"Maybe it was my prep or my recipe, but the baked food didn't come out neatly.First I had just used a standard cake mix, with baker's spray on the pan first. Not a one came out perfectly.Then I tried a true madeleine recipe...same deal.I think it would work with a buttery or heavy cookie like shortbread.If you're going to frost something, I guess it doesn't matter."
1,Ouch!,"This thing squeezes way too hard (and can't be adjusted). I only used it twice and my thumb was numb all day. And I'm not a wimpy guy. Or maybe I am, judging by the other reviews. I sent it back the same day and received a full refund minus $3 for the super saver shipping."
5,Recommended for fans of just about any type of music,"Recommended for fans of just about any type of music, not just H.I.M. its not too hard, or too soft."
4,Take everthing from 70's rock and add a little weight,"Nebula are one of a number of bands from the last 10 years that have taken up the 70's rock resurgence, often doing it better than the bands from the 70's. If you can't get enough of that kind of music then this is a must buy. If you have a passing interest I would reccomend finding a site that offers Nebula downloads and pick the individual songs you like.Charged is probably the best Nebula disc but honestly they are so consistent you can't go wrong with any of them."
1,Sack Blabbath,"When I first heard this I laughed so hard I thought I was going to wet myself. I purchased this based on some ravings I read that described Nebula's sound as psychedelic. I hear no psychedelia here - all I hear is three guys trying painfully hard to re-create the sound of early Black Sabbath. The lyrics to these songs are so bad they'd make a dog laugh. Try to imagine a band lead by the school bus driver on The Simpsons and you get a pretty good idea of what this is like. Save your money and get ""Volume 4"" by Sabbath instead."
1,Terribly disappointing,"Incredibly average or below average toaster at a ridiculously expensive price. We bought this based on the great reviews (for this and other models identical except for color), and expected a toaster that performed well and was solidly built. We found neither to be the case. The build quality is no better or more substantial than the $20 toaster we bought this one to replace. We noticed a loud hum when the toaster was turned on, and several of the heating elements did not appear to function properly. And although the product description says it has maximum power, it didn't toast any faster or more evenly than our current cheap toaster. For the high price we expected something a whole lot better. We were sorely disappointed. I'd say keep looking. Don't waste your time or money on this one."
1,The worst toaster ever,"This is seriously one of the worst toasters I've ever used. Not only does it toast unevenly, it burns everything, even frozen things, even on the lowest setting. On the bright side, it looks nice."
2,It's just a toaster,I don't know how they can justify charging over $100 for a toaster. It makes toast that's all. All I can say is it's very average and functional. Besides the price my only other gripe it that the springs inside are too strong. It will send your toast half way to the ceiling. Heavy bagels are fine but small bread or lighter english muffins will launch out of that thing like a rocket. One time my toast flew out then bounced off the cabinet and ended up on the floor. Another time it ended up in the sink. You would think for that price they could make something a little better. Well at least it looks nice there on the counter and I do like the lift function to help remove small items like toaster pastry. My advise would be to save your money and just get a cheap one.
4,Nice Shelf for the Price!,"We bought this shelf as an end table for our couch because it is tall enough to put a reading lamp and a small speaker. The finish of the shelf is glossy and nice, it's easy to assemble and delivery was fast. We are happy with the purchase!"
3,book shelf,"easy to assemble , of average quality. I am sure it cost no more than $5 retail in Vietnam where it's made"
2,"Finish is Nice, Fit is a joke","The wood is nicely finished, pretty. However, the workers were smoking something when they were drilling the mounting holes. The pre-drilled holes for the back braces were a good two inches off. Impossible to use them. Those braces are now in the trash. The pre-drilled holes for the top self were off by 1/4 inch. I had to force the screws, which was not easy because of the design and lack of room to get the wrench at any angle with leverage.Fortunately, I have no plan for anything heavy going on the shelves, so I just continued on with assembly. The unit does look good. Since it would cost almost as much to return, I'll just use as is."
3,"Adequate, but has some assembly issues","The first thing I noticed was how dark it is; it is definitely darker than the pictures will have you believe!The main pieces are the left/right sides. Screws attach the bottom shelf into those sides at four points. Screws attach the top shelf onto those sides at four points. So, eight screws total. The holes didn't line up very well, but fortunately they weren't so bad that I needed to make new holes. My main issue was the middle shelf. Unlike the other shelves, this one does not screw in. Instead, it has four wood pins that you push into holes in the sides. For me, these didn't line up at all; so I took a knife and sliced part of each pin until I could finally push them into the holes.Overall, this shelf works fine for what I use it for (light loads in a very confined space). I wouldn't put anything heavy on the middle shelf."
2,The shelf broke after 2 months use,I purchased this shelf from Amazon in January and after less than 2 months use the middle shelf completely broke in half. The shelf had a basket on it with a few books in it and it simply broke. I am not sure what to do with it now as it is not usable. Up until it broke I loved the shelf and had I reviewed it earlier I would have given it at least 4 stars.
3,Espresso book cases,"They do their job. I use them as speaker stands. The construction of them seems kinda cheep, though. The finish is splotchy and the drilled holes don't quite line up right. But at about 10 feet away, they look nice. Worth the price compared to other items in the same price range."
5,"Winsome Wood Shelf, Espresso","I'm very happy with the Winsome Wood Shelf, Espresso that I bought. It arrived in a timely manner, was easy to assemble, Gives me more space in my bathroom and is attractive to look at. I give this product five stars."
1,Shop Around: This Bundle Not Worth It,"My one star review is not about the TV show; Wonder Woman is simply awesome. It is to review this particular bundled version, which most likely is just the 3 individual separate sets shrink wrapped together and sold as ""The Complete Collection"". Check out your local stores like Target - mine has them for about $15 each."
3,Not bad.,"I use to watch this when I was very small. It brings back the memories. Though it was a bit too tongue-in-cheek, it was far better than the Batman series that pre-ceded this. Linda Carter is a beautiful woman and did well in this roll, though by today's standards... she runs like a girl.For what it is, this is great."
4,Its good to remember,"I must say its good to be reacquainted with an old girlfriend.( a guy can dream, can't he? ha!) Seriously, its a joy to relive a fun show. I had forgotten how the comic book feel pushed it past camp and gave the show a wonderful dose of surreal-ity. However, I did take off one star for one reason. I dislike heartily those double sided discs. Speak peace to me, somebody?**UPDATE**Be PROFOUNDLY CAREFUL with the double sided discs as they can scratch very easily. My first set hung up on several episodes; but good old Amazon comes through with a speedy replacement"
4,What can you say,This was a great series. I seem to remember more episodes but I watched this a long time ago maybe my mind invented it's own episodes because I didn't want it to end; and I remember those like they were real in any case Linda Carter was incredible and a true personification of Wonder Woman I can't imagine anyone else being able to bring the character to life like she did. The only downfall I see in this was that it was only 3 seasons I'd have watch 10. Again a great series.
4,Good show,"My girl loves Linda Carter, and this show in particular. We're both geeks, so this is one we both enjoy. It's fun, cheesy and Linda Carter is a real beauty! ;)"
5,Wonder Woman: The complete collection,She's a wonder!!! And so is this show!!! It is still one of my favorite shows of all time!!!
1,why are we supposed to like this....,"This was 1970's cheese. It's awful. I can see why Lynda Carter's career never took off, she is awful in acting. As for the costume and the scripts, let's not go there. I used to like this show, but it has aged poorly."
1,Wonderful Memories,"This set is great. It brings back a lot of good memories. I was watching it on the DVD on my computer when about half way through the first season, the Media Player quit reading it. Now I have to watch it upstairs, but it's still good."
5,Wonder Woman Rocks!,This is a classic from my childhood. I had to have the series. Bought two of these editions - one for me and one for my gf's little girl who is now a fan. Can't go wrong with this set!
3,Wonder Woman,I bought these when my son told me that girls could not be super heros. My Daughter loves them and my son now knows that women can be super heros too. Added benefit is that first season takes place during World War 2. My kids are asking me so many questions about what that was all about.Really cheesey series but lots of fun.Wonder Woman - The Complete Collection
4,Wonder Woman is a great classic!,My girlfriend is a huge wonder woman fan. She grew up watching the television show with Lynda Carter. She was amazed and pleased that I found the complete collection for her on DVD...and at such a low price. This was my first buy on Amazon.com and it was from a private seller. The experience was great! From now on I'm doing all my gift shopping on Amazon.com.
5,Linda Carter--enough said,"I watched this when I was a kid...I had a crush on Linda as Wonder Woman. We needed a woman hero and she was it. Well done Linda, to bad only 3 seasons.I'm not going into the episodes, you will have to buy the product to see how great her work was."
5,Good TV Show. Cute/Awsome looking Actress.,Good TV Show with a Cute/Awsome looking Actress.Good Stories through out the series.Glad I bought it...
5,da best band ever their my FAVE band!!,"i love super garage!!!!! they are the best ever. i've never seen their music video but im gonna soon!!! they gotta get another cd made soon! i love their lyrics, vocals and guitar! i know how to play FAVE on the guitar i like them cause their words make scence and im only 11!! id love to find more about them. thanx"
4,School Book,"I bought this book as a backup for the one we use in school. The book itself is good with explaining most concepts, but not always clear. Overall, I would suggest this book."
5,Fascinating insider's look at the war in Iraq,"I'm not good with detail so I will just give my impressions of this book. Normally I have trouble reading non-fiction but I had heard Anne Garrels on NPR and couldn't help being curious about the woman behind the insightful reports from Baghdad. I took ""Naked in Baghdad"" with me on vacation in Maui and had trouble putting the book down. It was an easy read but not at all fluffy. I was impressed not only by her intelligence and sensitivity as she tried to convey what the situation was like for normal Iraqi citizens, but also her bravery and dedication to her job. I also enjoyed her husband Vint Lawrence's email updates to friends and family, which were both touching and entertaining. The story of her relationship with her driver/translator Amer was also impressive. I am recommending this to all of my friends!"
3,Given a choice...,"As much I strongly admired Ms. Garrel's intrepid journalism under fire account in her book (the title however makes me think of some '60s strip club in San Francisco, a place also known as Baghdad by the Bay), and though there are many choice passages in her NPR written-word narrative, for my money and historical value, I much prefer ""Embedded: The Media at War in Iraq,"" by Bill Katovsky and Timothy Carlson, which packs an emotional wallop of 60 interviews with reporters from across the globe, including a revealing and harrowing account also from embedded NPR correspondent Eric Westervelt. Grenades, RPGs, sniper fire, and dodging death punctuate these 60 personal stories behind the news stories from the battlefield. Talk about deadlines. Sorry, Ms. Garrels, Embedded works because it reminds me of the best of Studs Terkel."
1,Perfect Read for Those Against the Liberation of Iraq,"Anti-US/Anti-Bush whine from one of the in-house Bush haters at NPR. Writing from the safety of a Baghdad hotel and during her 3 week vaction on the East coast,this former major network reporter riles against the forces that liberated Iraq from the Butcher of Baghdad. Garrels whines endlessly about her personal inconveniences and seems to think that alone was reason enough not to overthrow Saddam & Sons. Those who heard her reports during GWII will remember her as harried,ill-informed and quick to falsely charge the US with the killing of Iraqi citizens--all of which is rehashed in this rush to print book. Don't waste your money buying this self-righteous bemoaning as you will soon be able to get your fill of the author's dull car battery stories and misreporting on US ""atrocities"" as the she shills this book on countless public subsidized radio venues."
4,Fearless,"Our family has been following Garrels' career since she was in Moscow with ABC. She is one of the best reporters anywhere. Her reports from Baghdad during the war were remarkable. She is fearless.This short book makes me think that Garrels is not the sort of person who can patiently sit at home writing something longer than a dispatch from the front. I enjoyed reading about what happened ""behind the mike,"" but the narrative seemed forced. The e-mails from her husband seemed almost gimmicky, as if her editor was looking for a way to point up how brave Garrels was, without having her tell you herself. After listening to those reports from Baghdad, we don't need to be told she's brave. We know.Although she tells us in the book that she has retired from reporting from war zones, I wouldn't be surprised to hear her reporting from the next hot spot, calmly, and getting the stories that everyone else missed."
4,Compelling Book,"Here is a book that gives us much of the background behind Anne Garrels time in Baghdad. It takes us in chronological order through the evnts of the war with Iraq and her experiences during that time in the city of Baghdad. For anyone who waited expectantly for each day's new report from Anne this book will be a reality checkpoint as what it was like to be there.Her words are interspersed with emails of her husband, that were mailed to friends and family at that time"
5,True Journalisam,"Enough good words have been said about the book. But ultimately, this book is not about the war. That's why readers who expected to get detailed war stories will be disappointed.It's about true journalism. Annie showed us the grace under fire, the courage to pursuit the truth, the genuine care for the people she reported on, and above all, the dedication to give a voice to the people who couldn't speak for themselves."
5,Amazing chance to learn the story behind that voice on the radio,"As a listener to NPR, I feel so much closer to Garrels after learning the backstory behind her reports from the trenches of Iraq. She has extreme skill and intuition at conducting herself in a foreign country, at making people willing to talk, at befriending the right people.I learned a lot about how much the Iraqi government practiced supression in the old regime. People were terrified for their lives if they talked to foreign reporters, and Garrels had to pay many bribes to get press credentials. When leaving Iraq, corrupt officials invent tests and fees for Garrels and her assistant to pay. Her stories humanized the Iraqi conflict for me--I met both crooks and good guys through Garrels.Garrels has a great storytelling style. She'll tell an anecdote and then end with a biting one line zinger. She's as taltened on paper as she is on the air, and I'll be watching for more from this amazing woman."
5,Moving...,"I was captivated by Anne Garrels' memoir of her experiences reporting for NPR in Iraq. I couldn't put the book down and didn't want it to end. I admire this woman tremendously. She has so much courage and at the same time is not hardened by the reality of war. The book is honest and well-written. I loved the inclusion of her husband's emails, and was especially moved by the relationship with Amer, her driver. Thank you Anne Garrels for a wonderful book."
1,"Deceiving picture, small...is an understatement.","I bought this as a gift the picture on the website is misleading, they need to put dimensions on the site when they said small they weren't kidding. If your lucky you might be able to fit a pack of cigarettes in there. No woman I know carry that little in their purse, I am very unhappy with the lack of dimensions on the site and the picture of it makes it look large enough to actually carry something useful other then a pack of gum."
2,did not like,Got this movie cause Sarah Jessica Parker is in it and cause it has good reviews BUT I did not like it that much. It kinda dragged on for me.I could only watch 40 min and they decided it's not worth it.
1,Dismayingly bad,"It's not just that If lucy Fell is a bad film. 90% of what comes out of Hollywood is uninspired, formulaic dross just like it, and usually you can just shrug it off and forget about it. What makes this movie memorably, remarkably bad is writer/director/star Eric Schaeffer's nauseatingly immense sense of self-regard, which arises from every frame like the stench of yesterday's roadkill. The mere fact that the photogenically-challenged Mr. Schaeffer should have the likes of Elle MacPherson tell him - totally without irony - that he's ""cute"" speaks volumes."
4,Not nearly as bad as some people have said,"Although this isn't the most polished movie, it is genuinely entertaining, and only someone not remotely interested in seeing a romantic comedy would give it 0-1 stars.I can't remember why I first picked it up (I didn't see it in the theaters), but it is a consistently funny, touching film. I'm not a fan of Sarah Jessica Parker, Elle MacPherson (who I feel turns in the strangest, poorest performance of the bunch), or even Ben Stiller, but I think it's easy to identify with people so afraid to be in love, but so afraid not to be in a committed relationship.All in all, it's a bunch of laughs, and kind of a relief to watch something that takes itself less seriously than some of the big-name romantic comedies that are put out today and fall flat."
3,er... it misses the mark I believe,"If Lucy Fell isn't really a bad movie. It's not particularly funny either, except for a scene involving a flying telephone, and a fair share of subtle moments here and there.It's not a bad romantic comedy. I didn't expect much because I'm not a fan of Jessica Parker, but I guess it could have been a lot worse.Now, had this been a more serious storyline with drama instead of comedy, two people agreeing to kill themselves before their 30th birthday without finding their soulmate would have made for a better movie in my opinion.I feel 3 stars is a good rating. Definitely better movies out there though in the romantic comedy department."
5,My favorite movie,"Sometimes you just want a movie that is predictable, but that you can watch over and over again."
1,one star is too much,"I did not find this movie funny or heartwarming. sarah jessica parker is such a bad actress and i never felt the warmth of the relationship between her and schaeffer. it seemed forced and cold. the movie seemed like a collection of disconnected scenes lacking any cohesion. what i got was a movie full of unfunny and weird scenes that made me, ..., want to push them over myself.as for the dvd, why make this movie into a dvd? there were virtually no features added. the movie is bad already and with the lack of features, this movie is better off in vhs format alone. ..."
1,When Sarah Jessica Parker fell,"The appeal of Sarah Jessica Parker befuddles me. She's whiney, fairly homely, but has Hollywood to make her look like the desirable piece of tail she's played repeatedly in whatever she does. Even her most successful role in ""Sex in the City"" plays on this somehow drummed up myth that Parker is appealing to men. Maybe Matthew Broderick. But strident, homey, little talented actresses get little slack in my department. And ever since ""Honeymoon in Vegas,"" all she's ever been in demand to play is the same dang thing over and over, some type of sought after piece of tail. What a career! She's right up there with Christie Canyon in that department. On that basis alone, this movie flops from it's first dialogue. There hasn't been 1 thing Parker has put out that I'd pay to see."
3,WHEN JOE MET LUCY,"If you're into predictable 90's romantic comedies, this is one of the better ones. There are some really nice moments in this film and at certain points it is very funny.However the film is often unconvincing and certain developments seem unprovoked.Some of the diolgue is pretty corny, but most of it is well written, sencire and personal."
1,AHHH Please jump!,"I thought I would like it because I like SJP and it seemed it would be cute. Oh LORD, it is not! The whole movie I was wincing at Eric Schaeffer making a FOOL of himself in a way that provoked no laughs and all pain. I just wanted him to jump off the bridge already! Along with all the guys who go after SJP in the film."
4,Toa of Fire!,"This toy was easy to assemble. The model has easy-to-follow, step-by-step, instructions. It also has instructions on how to build Akamai, which is Tahu, Onua, and Pohatu combined. The set has 33 pieces and is for 7+ ages. Easy, fun, cool toy. Cheap too!"
5,10 year old loved it,"I know nothing about the bionicle universe but my 10 year old nephew loves anything bionicle. He put this together as soon as he opened it and I have to say even I thought it was pretty cool - it has gears on the back of it's head that you use to make it swing it's sword around. And he showed me where the evil guy can put his mask over this one and take it over (when I said ""cool!"" he said - well no because he's *evil*). So if you have a kid in your life who is into bionicles this one is a pretty cool one."
4,Informative read.,The horrors inflicted on the populace of Europe by Hitler's Nazis should never be forgotten. This account corroborates the evidence put forth by other survivors.
4,"This book gives a day-by-day diary of life in the ""labor"" camps of Auschwitz during WW2.","If you are interested in the Holocaust, this book is a must-read. It's hard to conceive of the atrocities that befell the Jews and other ""inferior races"" in the Nazi's quest for world domination."
5,A Haunting Book . . .,I read this book as a History Major in Grad School over 13 years ago. I have since read other accounts of this era but this is the book that still haunts me to this day. I have not picked it up since but the story stays with me as does the strength of the human spirit this book so clearly displays. I hope that we never forget the lessons learned from this period in history and that survivor stories such as this live on for many decades after the last survivor is gone.
5,The best of holocaust literature..,"Olga Lengyel's 'Five Chimneys' is probably the most descriptive and compehensive book written on Auschwitz-Birkenau from a survivor's point of view. Many authors have written outstanding books on this subject but Lengyel's is the most moving and detailed of those books. The story is outlined by other reviewers here so I won;t get into that but simply say read it, it deserves it's 5 star rating."
3,It was okay,"A terrible ordeal, related from first-hand experience. I was expecting more description of the daily life in the camp. It didn't go deep enough for me. The story was a familiar one. I don't want to diminish the awfulness. But I was expecting to read more details of events, subplots, that I hadn't known before. Maybe we've seen and heard all there is to see and tell about the holocaust."
4,Five Chimneys,"Very moving account from a person that lived through the Holocaust. Although haunting and sad, this story needs to be told to the world with the hope that we will NEVER allow this to happen again."
5,So we shall never forget,"Having members of my family (two still alive) that survived Auschwitz this was a book that I felt I had to read. It is like many other books that I have read about the Holocaust but the first from strictly a women's account of Birkenau. It may be a difficult read for some because of the stark descriptions that exist. The story does not sugar-coat nor mince words. This is a true to life account as best as can be expressed. The book will compel the reader to pose questions of their own abilities to survive and withstand the horrors that the author did. This book is a fairly easy read and once you pick it up, it is hard to put down. We need books like this because the numbers of those who survived are becoming fewer and fewer and the words that they write are testimonials to TRUTH and must never ever be forgotten."
5,One of the best Holocaust accounts ever written,"This book was first published in English in 1947. It presents life and death in Auschwitz in great detail, and offers an excellent overview of the concentration camp world. The author's own story is gripping and heart-wrenching. The early date, 2 years after WWII ended, ensures that the author's memories of the camp are still lucid and the details very precise. Olga Lengyel studied to be a physician, and her informed analysis of the treatment meted out to inmates make this book special. I view this book as a Holocaust Studies ""benchmark"" - other accounts often fall short of its quality and level of detail. It is also significant as an account of a woman's experience. Until recently, women's Holocaust experiences were a rather neglected area."
3,Five chimneys,Detailing story of the life of a survivor of the.concentration camps. The story details her life and life of others. Sometimes stories jumps around and repeats itself in an effort to place all l knowledge on writing.
5,"A very well written, and very personal, yet descriptive accounting of Auschwitz.","The idea of writing a review about a Holocaust memoir is revolting to me. All I will say is that I felt most connected to both the humanity and the horror from this telling than from any other. It is both factual, as if reading a history textbook, but is written so much so from this person's own experiences, that I was finally able to at least wrap my head around the worst tragedy to ever befall mankind from at least ONE person's perspective. Thank you Olga Lengyel, you served as witness to the generations that will follow at the highest standards of penmanship and humanity."
3,A basic recount of a horrific story.....,One woman's account of hell on earth. Her strength and determination are admirable. Thank you for sharing your story and reminding people of the evil that still prevails in our society.
5,Heart Reacking,This book was the best thing i have read since The Dairy of Anne Frank i give so much love to this woman for the strong sence of mind she must have had to go though all that ordle.
5,Holocaust thru the eyes of a professional career woman,"The writer sounds like any career woman, smart and knowledgeable, and duped by the Nazis smoke screen they put up on every turn. you identify with her naveté and her need to believe the worst wil not happen. great book I just hope that some point in her after the war experience she forgave herself."
5,Five Chimneys,"I have read a very large number of holocaust books and none are more incredible than this one. Five Chimneys gave a perspective that no other Auschwitz/Birkenau book gives...that of an educated,sophisticated woman prisoner. There are two books that stand out in my mind as far superior on this topic and this is one of the two. I couldn't lay it down. It is one of the books that will surely help us to make certain that it never happens again."
3,Five Chimmnys,"I enjoyed the story and could feel some of the pain, hurt and suffering that they went through. AI did feel that sometimes that I got lost has to how she was able to get to the various places and do some of the things that she did."
2,disappointed,"I FOUND THIS BOOK HARD TO UNDERSTAND WITH THE WORDS THE AUTHOR USED, IT WAS NOT A GOOD READ, IT TOOK ALOT FOR ME TO GET THROUGH IT. SHE REPEATED HER SELF SEVERAL TIMES AND SOME THINGS DID NOT MAKE SENSE. I CAN NOT UNDERSTAND HOW THIS WOMEN VOLUNTARILY WENT TO THE CONCENTRATION CAMP WITH HER PARENTS AND CHILDREN. IF SHE WANTED TO BE WITH HER HUSBAND WHY DIDN'T SHE GO AND LEAVE HER CHILDREN WITH HER PARENTS. ALSO THE ENTIRE BOOK WAS TO CLINICAL. I HAVE READ SEVERAL BOOKS ABOUT THE HOLCAUST AND THEY WERE REMARKABLE THIS ONE WAS NOT , I SHOULD HAVE SAVED MY MONEY."
4,I Had No Idea,"When I watched this tape I actually cried, it made me realize that I have neve made love to anyone in my life.I have only experienced very crude, base sex-essentially a hit and run event. The way the movie was filmed was explicit, but not pornopgraphic, the couples talked about their levels of discomfort, and the narrartor assisted by making suggestings and comments to help with the ""shyness"" or lack of control. I have always said ""Sex starts as soon as you wake up in the morning."" The daily devotion exercise proved that I was right. If more couples would take the time to learn this technique the divorce rate would be a lot lower. If you are looking for pronography this is the wrong video; this video is about love, nuturing and caring for your partner on a spritual/sexual plane."
4,A sensual look at being a better lover,Learn to relax and understand you and your lover's internal triggers and desires. This video emphasizes learning to be with your lover in a sensual way with or without having sex.
5,"Star Trek - The Animated Series (DVD, 2006, 4-Disc Set)","This is a great addition to add to your orginial Star Trek Box Set collection, it comes in a plastic case that is just like the recent season's box sets of the original series,so it looks great displayed, and most of the original series actors reprise their roles also,so if you are a fan of the orginial series then this is for you. The Animated Series was a gift for my boyfriend,since he has all the other Star Trek dvd box sets,so I knew he would love it and he did,the animated series is great, and is just as good as the orginial series.Star Trek The Animated Series - The Animated Adventures of Gene Roddenberry's Star Trek"
5,Must have for ST fans!,"I believe that this series on Saturday mornings is what really opened the world of Star Trek to me. I read that an author of a recent ST novel said in his little biography that he's still 'getting over the fact that Star Trek was a live action show before it was a cartoon.' No, this is the best animation compared to our days with computers - but there are some great classic stories hiding here. Since the stories are only half an hour each, they move rather quickly. This set is worth owning for 'Yesteryear' and 'More Tribbles, More Troubles' alone. I used to get all wrapped up in 'canon' issues, but now my criteria for Star Trek is - Does it entertain me? Does it make me think in new directions? The answer to both of these questions is yes for the Animated series."
5,An Excellent Continuation of the Original Show,"The stories offered up in the animated series are excellent and even if you are not a fan of ""cartoons"" or animation, you will soon forget all that while viewing this wonderful series. It seems more like a continuation of the original rather than a stand alone series. A must have of any fan of the original or Star Trek in general. Rewatchability factor is high!"
4,Star Trek : The Animated Series,The DVD where great the only I would of like is the DVDs play better on my PS2 they play great on my DVD players in the living room and my mini DVD player.
4,"For Fans of Star Trek, The Original Series","If you've purchased the original Star Trek DVDs, then you'll want to also see Star Trek The Animated Series. You can really tell that Gene Roddenberry was involved with the stories as they compliment the original shows beautifully. The character development and story lines are exceptionally well done and the animation allowed them to introduce exotic aliens on other worlds without having to resort to low-budget costumes and makeup that were sometimes needed to create aliens on the original show. Overall this series is lots of fun, full of surprises, and a bargain price to enjoy some additional adventures that includes most of the original cast performing their voices."
5,This IS classic Saturday morning TV,"This is classic Saturday morning cartoon goodness. To spoil this series by redoing it in CGI is just plain crazy. Is the animation bad? Well, yeah kind of, but thats all part of the experience. If you watched these great episodes in an updated animation style (like new scooby doo cartoons where they go crazy with shading) it just wouldn't bring back the memories. I think thats what this series will do for me...bring back great memories. The older live action Star Trek episodes are being ""enhanced"", and I don't like it. Watching older TV series on DVD is about great memories and great TV. I'm glad this animated series was left AS-IS. I cant wait for release. Bring on the great memories!"
3,At least the voices are the characters,A must see for The Original TV series fans. At least it gaps the era between the TV shows and the Star Trek Movie (with Voyager --- V'ger). The episode stories wasn't that great. Animation is ordinary. The only plus is that Most of the character voices are the same original actors.A Must See but not a must have. Not something even a diehard Star Trek Fan would watch over and over.
3,I think I have outgrown cartoons.,"I purchased the Star Trek animated series to complete my Star Trek Collection.While I appreciate the familiar voices of Kirk, Spock and Scotty, there was still something missing. I fell asleep during the first episode.Still, the new stories is something I can appreciate. I thoroughly enjoyed the paperback Star Trek stories I have read (hmmm, maybe I haven't completed my collection -there are still a lot of printed Star Trek stories).But I do not regret my purchase of Star Trek - The Animated Series."
4,Star Trek The Animated Series,"This ""animated series"" starts where the original series ends. The five-year mission was cut short and the animated series not only continues the mission but adds new species and beings that could not realistically be done in the original version. Definitely a must see for all Star Trek fans!"
2,"Poor, Nasty, Brutish and Short","Author Strathern went too much for humor and sarcasm and left us with a short but unhelpful tome. Of the 59 pages of commentary, the first 20 or so were brutal to ge through, as Strathern focuses too much on trying to be funny and sarcastic and too little on teaching us about Locke's life and thinking. The latter part of the book does this, but it is too superficial and assumes too much prior knowledge from the reader. It is hard enough to keep track of who sat on the British throne let alone how Locke's ideas were influenced by those who preceded him and how he influenced those who followed; it is particularly in the latter where Strathern fails. I would not even recommend this as an introduction to Locke, unless one is interested in some of the more personal aspects of his life."
4,Great way for kids to record their experiences,"This book is a good way for kids to keep up with their writing skills over the summer, and record a description of their summer adventure to look back on years to come. The book is compact enough to travel with, and has good prompts to help kid's think about things to write."
2,Couldn't give it as a present,"Besides being a lot less of a lego than I expected for the price, when it arrived the box it was in was smashed since it was just packed in an envelope and the lego was in a thin cardboard box. I had to buy something else to give as the gift and then just added this to it."
2,Customer suppport is too bad,"I had this ""Linksys Compact Wireless-G Internet Video Camera (WVC54GC)"" for a long while. Recently, I try to re-install it and not able to find my previous CD. But Customer support re-direct me to a web site which will cost me $$$. I'm giving up on this internet camera for its low image quality, incompatibility with my UNIX server."
2,Very basic...,I got the camera installed and working with no problems at all. The motion detection actually works as advertised.Image quality is extremely poor though. Would be hard pressed to recognize a person standing more than 10 feet from camera.Was unable to configure the remote access service. I use a Linksys router as well. The documentation for proper port and firewall settings is minimal and there is no troubleshooting help to be found anywhere on the web for this product. (including the Linksys web site)
1,Terrible,Image is terrible and totally unviewable in low light. Don't waste your money on this cam. Linksys should refund everyone who has bought one of these.
2,Poor video quality and features don't work,"I got this because it is supposed to be able to e-mail you if it detects motion. Unfortunately for me, not only will it not e-mail me. it doesn't detect motion, and doesn't save video even if I set it to record. All in all a waste of time.The only reason it doesn't get one star is the Linksys tech support (chat online). They were accessible and responsive. But they say I should return the camera at my cost, and they will ship me a new one by ground. Given that to do that will cost me more than a replacement from a different manufacturer (I'm not in the US) I won't bother.Edit: Don't bother to get this unless your subject is always in bright light. Dim light performance is lousy."
1,Linksys wireless camera,"Cost, good. Quality of picture, soso. I was not able to establish a web link to the camera. Motion detection works real good. Better than standard web cam but picture quality is poor. Wireless feature is good."
4,Good camera for the money.,Very reasonable performance for a low cost camera.Image is a bit fuzzy. Motion detection is not reliable as it reacts to lighting changes. Recording software is flaky with buffer overflow.
1,"Junk, don't bother.","The setup is not easy, the software only works with Windows, and you can only view the video with internet explorer. The video quality is horrible. Don't bother with this one."
1,AWFUL,"What an awful product. After less than a week of use, the camera will no longer connect to my wireless network. Even when it did, it kept causing the wireless router to crash several times a day. Recording settings for the camera software were lost if the computer was re-booted. The instruction manual is poorly written and doesn't even accurately describe the software interface. Save your money."
1,Works only with windows,"It was given to me as gift.The title in this review might be a little bit misleading. You can use MAC or LINUX to get the video stream from this camera; however, you have to figure out your own recording solution. The setup software and recording works with only Windows. If you use something else, you are on your own. I give 1 star rating because of this.To be fair, Linksys printed on the box that this product only works with Windows."
3,Linksys Wireless Camera,"The camera seems to be a good product in itself, but since I didn't have a Linksys wireless router, I never could get it to work. Support helped me for awhile, but then gave up saying they couldn't help me with my Zone Alarm router. I will probably return it as I can't sacrifice security for it."
4,Works well for the price,"The camera was easy to set up and worked on the first try. Image quality is fine given the relatively low price. A number of cheaper wireless cameras don't support WPA encryption, but this one does. If you're looking for a simple, inexpensive fixed lens camera to monitor an area, this one does the job."
3,Bigger than it looks.,"The image quality of this camera isn't great, and as the other reviewer states, it needs lots of light. The resolution of the video is fairly poor, comparable to a very cheap 4-year-old webcam. If you need to see detail in the image (e.g. for certain security-camera purposes), then it will not work.Another thing to note is that this camera is much bigger than it looks--it is about the size of your hand. I was hoping to squeeze it into a tight space, but the camera's size took me by surprise. It will be difficult to hide this camera if you are hoping to use it for hidden security purposes.In sum, if you need a cheap camera that can sit out in the open and take low-detail video of a well-lit room, then this is your product. Otherwise, you should look for more professional (or wired) cameras."
1,Incredibly bad,"I'm amazed that Linksys could put out such a crappy product.It's huge and the picture quality is incredibly poor.The only way to use it is with IE 5.5+ or bad utility progra that comes with it. FireFox, Messengers and Skype won't work.I wanted to use it to embed the picture in a web site.The only way to do it is to pay them to host it for you. Wow!I've asked for an API to write some software for it, but Linksys refused. Please, save your money."
1,VERY disappointing,"DO NOT BUY THIS CAMERA. I have come to know Linksys as a maker of quality products, but this camera shakes those thoughts.My #1 disappointment is the software. We bought the camera to record motion detection. That works okay if you never reboot. Every time you reboot your PC you lose all those settings. Ridiculous!!!Tech support is AWFUL. What a joke! Finally after two months, this is what they have to say: ""We apologize for the inconvenience that this has caused you. Our Product Engineers have just released the product testing results, and this scenario can be attributed as software limitation; and as a result, Linksys no longer provides a fix for this issue. ""A ""software limitation""! Who in the world wants to re-do the setup on software every time they reboot their PC. IT'S AN ABSOLUTE JOKE!Linksys - I am very disappointed in you."
2,Poor Performance - Not Recommended,"I gave 2 stars for the product quality. Here are the details on the camera1. Video Quality is Very Poor and pixelated2. We are living in a time of high def and high megapixels, the captured image quality should be atleast as good as the cell phone camera and I am sorry to say that it has a poor image quality.3. The streaming and connecting to network router is not bad.4. Video Sensor not at all sensitive (Have to have very good light), but not lot of details are captured anyway.5. DDNS Service will charge extra money for our own Internet address and usage.I did the best possible testing for one day and this camera is going back. I am replacing this with Panasonic BL-C131A Network Camera"
1,"way too many issues with the product, the software and with technical support at Linksys","Overlooking the fact that one of the cameras arrived without a power supply, I set the other two up. There are some bugs in the software that caused the PC to error out. After a reasonably straightforward setup, the cameras eventually worked for about an hour before dropping off the system and becoming invisible to the router until powered down and up. This happened repeatedly, Tech Support sent me updated firmware but this appeared to make things worse. Boxed them all back up and sent them back for a full refund."
1,Activex!!! Diffcult setup!,"Come on guys, I regret buying this piece of crap. It's the worst web cam ever.The resolution is nasty, but that's ok, I knew that.What I didn't read anywhere at the product description is:* The setup will take you at least half an hour* Updating the firmware is challenging, no firmware link on linksys web site, took my one hour to find on search engines the firmware update* The size is ridiculous, it's huge* Wireless signal is really reaaaaaally poor.* ACTIVEX !!!! So... no Safari, no Firefox, no nothing... just IE... come on...I'm really disappointed and I'll try to return or sell this thing as soon as possible"
2,Web Cam,"This Web Cam does not have any low light quality at all, I have several cheaper webcams that have MUCH better low light quality. I would not suggest anyone buying this cam for settings where lighting is not Extremely bright."
2,Still not working,"The e-mail feature of this product made it very useful as a home security product. I have yet, with the help of Linksys product support, been able to get this feature to work. I don't know if the camera is faulty or if the support center simply does not know enough about the device, but in either case the camera does not work as advertised. I would not recomend this device for anyone."
4,Could be better with sound,"Nice product, it work fine since first time.It could be the best if it has sound and night vision. You need good light to watch clear videos.I put it at work over internet without paying the sololink service. it's easy."
2,Read these reviews before you buy!!,"I bought this for security purposes. Sadly, I didn't read any reviews prior to purchasing. The idea is good, but the camera is just to dark to see anything. That's not even taking into account the poor resolution. It might be good if you had it in an office environment or aimed outside, but inside, you can't see much, and if you did, you wouldn't be able to get any features from a screenshot. You could tell there was a figure there, but that's about it. I can't really believe some project manager thought this was a good product. I can say the wireless setup was rather easy, but it just can't help the product."
4,Great Product,"People are giving this product a bad review and spreading misinformation about it. The setup was very easy and it worked as they advertised. Yes it is an ActiveX control and that is a very bad idea. However, it does work with other DDNS services such as DynDNS. All you have to do is enable the alternate port and then do a port forward on your router and you're there. The only complaint I have is with the email notification. It works great, but when I get off of work I start getting bombarded with emails (200+ Mb worth). I guess I will have to manually turn it on and off, but I can't really complain for $50."
2,Microsoft Specific,For the user who just wants to view his house from his office using his windows PC then go for it but just make sure you only want to use it during daylight hours. It really needs a lot of light so don't work late.My 2 star rating might be a little harsh as it does exactly what it says on the box but if your trying to do anything outside of this then forget it. You really are tied into the Microsoft. I wanted to try and integrate it with other applications but I have put it back in the box and I am now looking for an alternative infrared IP camera with good client support on Linux.
2,"Just works, but nothing incredible!!!","I have two cameras the WRVG54 and this one, the differences despite the size (this one is bigger than it looks) is taht this one doesnt have microphone and also the LED for the IP Adress as well as you will save space of the antenna, BUT the problem is that the image is very very poor, too dark!!, and I place it on the top of the wall on my kids room near a lamp, and I cannot see nothing if the lamp is on, its incredible!!!Also the AC cable is very short you will need an extension for sure, I do really not recommend to buy this item, maybe you ca get a D-Link with a similar price but MUCH MUCH better viewOne thing that I have to recognize from Linksys is their tech support it's amazin theyre 24/7 and the almost solve you everything"
2,doesn't work on a mac,"I used this product to watch my dogs at home when i was working but when i got my mac, i couldn't use it."
5,about as good as you can get!,"If you are studying Greek culture, this is a great book to look at. While I was spending a semester in Greece for school, this book was one of the required texts. It helped to understand the Greek people and their customs. The book is easy to read, easy to understand, and will definitely shine a light on life in a Greek culture."
3,"Two Degreese Loud Vioces, Two Degreese Quiet Music!!!","This album is not a master piece. The music didn't touch me, that is what I even herd of the album with all the rude people talking while this legendary band preformed."
4,No tracking problems here.,"I use mine for red oak, walnut and cherry. I have never had a problem with the tracking belt. It worked perfect right out of the box. The overload shutoff is a little test but as long as you dont try to take off too much at one time you will be fine. I have put about 1000bf of hardwood though mine in the last year with flawless results. The only reason I only give it 4 stars is because of the method used to load the paper. Its a pain in the a--."
3,Could be a 5 but...,"A previous reviewer reported that the torque limit (heater) could be set too low for the motor. I agree. First let me say that the Performax 10 x 20 is not a thickness planer but it does come with a very course (60grit) abrasive installed which would lead one to think that you could take a 1/32"" or so off of a narrow soft wood. I found that the Performax is so sensitive that the slightest adjustment can cause it to kick out half way through a pass. If you want to run, say two 2"" wide strips through at the same time, forget it.On the up side, it is well built, solid and a good addition to my shop. I am very glad that I bought it but when I see David Marks run three or four strips side by side through his machine I wonder if I made the right decision."
5,Well Built and a viable option to a planer,"I. like most, have a limited amount of space in my workshop so any new tool MUST be worthwhile. I was shopping for a thickness planer as I recently got a great deal on exotic hardwoods and need to bring them to a workable and uniform thickness. after reading everything about which Planer I wanted I ran across an article on Drum Sanders. They do a similar job, but the drum sander doesn't snipe, doesn't go through expensive blades and can actually flatten crowned boards better than a planer!!! I bought this one .... took an hour to adjust and learn it's operation and began running boards through it. Great addition to my shop. No planer required in my shop."
4,Jet Drum Sander,"After reading other reviews I was a bit reluctant to order this sander. They weren't very positive. The main complaint was the tracking of the feed belt. I did have to dial the unit in when first set up but after that I have continually made very minor adjustments as I was sanding to keep everything running smooth.I make guitars so I use the Jet to thickness my tone woods. I can take the measurement down to under one eigth inch with no problem at all. Just a fantastic and very even finish. I'm stoked with it!!Shane DonavanLaguna Beach, CA"
4,Performax 10-20 drum sander,"Manual needs work (I spent 30 minutes looking for parts that were already installed, while the manual said I needed to install myself). Highly recommend infeed/outfeed tables if you sand boards over 36"" long. Hard to hold long boards steady which results in gouging, even using rollers. Mine is on a stand with casters and the 10-20 is on a rubber pad. Extremely quiet and vibration free. Very well crafted, easy to use. If you try to sand too deep, the circuit breaker trips and saves the motor. Good feature! Easy to adjust."
5,Ninalishous!!,"I have been giving these treats to my two shelties(Nina and Jacob) for 7 years now and they just love them. I used them for training and for ""love you"" rewards. They are just the right size for multiple treating and bed time snacks without creating an overweight problem. I purchase them in the 20lb boxes and transfer them to sealed dog food storage containers which extends there shelf life considerably."
5,Older Dogs w/ Bad Teeth,Our dogs LOVE these. We have two 70 pound dogs that are each 11 years old. Their teeth are starting to go and so they can't chew on hard stuff as easily anymore. These are the perfect treat because they love the taste and they are so small they can break them wherever they want. Highly recommend.
3,"Good product, but, . . .","Old Mother Hubbard makes great snack for dogs, however, it seems that at least 25% of the busquits are broken & in ""tiny"" pieces.Guess next time I'll buy them locally, even tho they'll cost a bit more."
1,What????,"I don't know how J. Scott Lynch thought he had knowledge in the area of God- or 'for God's sake' as he likes to call it. He babbles on for pages and pages about completely incoherant, unrelated and meaningless rubbish. How a company decided to publish this book is beyond me. I am apalled and offended to have purchased and read such a completely offensive and worthless literary piece. J. Scott is an embarrasment to authors, publishers and religious figures. Go back to the drawing board J. Scott."
4,Good Film,"Very moving and emotional, nice view of the yangtze river. A must see film. Highly recommended."
3,long and drawn out,I bought this for the beaautiful scenery. the family commentary was a bonus. revealing more than I anticipated. mini travelog.
5,It's bloody brilliant !,"(...) This release is just so damned invigorating and fun to listen to that I can't recommend it enough.It's a ""power pop"" masterpiece, and the fact that all the songs run together make it a terrific ""party"" record.Buy it, buy it, and Moe Berg, please reform TPOH and come and play in Phoenix, these suckers need something to wake 'em up !"
5,Best BG Album Showcasing the classic days,"Blind Guardian's ""Tokyo Tales"" features live performances of songs from their first 4 CDs up to ""Somewhere Far Beyond"" and perhaps the best selections to showcase the Blind Guardian live shows as well. I've never owned the original 1993 version, but the remastered version sounds pretty good - loud, dynamic, and full. ""Tokyo Tales"" starts off with the opener from ""Follow The Blind"" then leads in to the speedy opener ""Banish From Sanctuary."" Is it just me or does the crowd sing extremely loudly...do they know all the lyrics? I kinda like this because you get the feel of a live show from Blind Guardian. ""Valhalla"" and ""Majesty"" are highlights as well with the crowd singing loudly and proudly and it makes you want to sing as well! All I have to say is that if you love Blind Guardian, get their live album ""Tokyo Tales"" as your power metal collection is not complete without this."
5,One of the Best Live Album Ever,"This should be one of the best ever live album and of course is the best album from guardian when you can get to know the old band.I really like the speed that guardian add to every song in this masterpiece, that was the first thing that catch me years ago.The Only thing that I regret concerning Tokyo Tales is that will never be release as a DVD, It looks like wasn't caught on video.Its a must have."
2,Blair's life does not reflect the entire industry,"Blair's book is an interesting read. However, it is not the life that most classical musicians lead (contrary to what she would have you believe). Do incidents like hers actually occur (the sex, drugs, etc.)--yes, but only with those kind of people: the desperate, the undisciplined, the sleazy. Blair certainly seems to be all of those.There are those who have made it (and I'm one) who didn't sell themselves, or abuse their bodies--and did it by hard work (something Blair should look into). And they continue to enjoy their craft while being happily married and raising a family. Certainly this would make a less interesting book (with fewer sales)--so is her portrayal accurate to most free-lancers? No. But she makes a lot more money by saying so. And again, she prostitutes herself by painting this false picture in the process, in pursuit of wealth and success. Too bad she isn't in pursuit of her soul."
3,worth a read,"I graduated from music school in 1979 and freelanced in many orchestras/festivals/chamber groups during and after college.I find the author's depiction of classical music freelancing very accurate and she has some very good insights into the state of classical music and how it got there.If you are interested in classical music it is worth reading.I did, however, only give it 3 stars because the explicit descriptions of Tindall's sordid personal life are pretty trashy."
1,Pathetic woman,"Maybe Blair should blame her parents on her ""musical misfortunes"" instead of the industry. After all, one's upbringing is what helps get them through life. Obviously she wasn't raised with any morals or self respect. I'm sorry to hear that she considers playing in a Broadway orchestra pit her ""fall from grace."" Those of us that do that sort of work enjoy and appreciate it and are proud to be there. I have yet to see an orgy take place in any of pits in which I have played. It's pathetic to hear somebody who had all of those wonderful opportunities whine and complain. Get over it, Blair. You could be in New Orleans right now."
2,An Uncomfortable Read for all the Wrong Reasons,"This book has many redeeming moments where Ms. Tindall lets her intellect and journalistic talents process the inequities of the classical music world. What's disturbing is how viciously she turns on her friends, colleagues, neighbors and teachers. Mozart in the Jungle would have been a more powerful book had it not been punctuated with so much personal cruelty towards the supporting cast to her story, That vitriol adds little to the purpose of her expose, or the autobiographical thread of the work. Thus the book swings from muckraking and sometimes funny details about the salaries, egos and libidos of classical music's gentry, to petty barbs, self-righteous pronouncements and catty personal details about the free-lance classical music community that struggles to survive, and make an art form possible. We hope that having dealt with her personal vendettas, that Tindell's next effort is more representative of her talents."
1,What about personal responsibility?,"I thought it a shame that Ms. Tindall spent so much time bemoaning sex as the only way to get her gigs. As a working musician for almost 20 years, I've never known anyone who had to do so...and yet, it seemed in many cases, she only won gigs through relationships which subsequently lost her those gigs. Perhaps if she'd actually learned how to make reeds (!), play her horn in tune, and overcome an almost theatrical case of performance anxiety, she might have earned gigs the way the rest of us do--through winning auditions. The fact that she had to further impugn the good names of many fine musicians in order to sell her story seems to highlight her lack of accountability. Too bad she now has a pen to wield instead of a rather lackluster oboe career."
1,Poorly Argued Tell All Book,"Blair Tindall's book Mozart in the Jungle is a sad, cynical, trite, and clumsily written account of the life of a not particularly intelligent, performance anxiety ridden musician desperate for attention. She has succeeded in ""taking on"" the classical music world by quoting statistics any well informed music lover or other literate person can dig up online. This laundry listing of information is presented in bits and pieces, sprinkled in a narrative that is heavy on the carnal entertainment (a must if you're going to sell a tell-all book at present), and light on any real information. Personal opinion is part of any biographic writing, but to substitute opinion for fact is never acceptable. Grand, sweeping generalizations seem to be the norm for this neophyte scribbler."
2,Not at all true,"As an oboist married to another musician, I have a hard time believing anything she writes in this book. Not once in my career (or my husband's) have we come across any of the sex, drugs and nepotism that she suggests. I also have a hard time believing her, as she played with the New York Philharmonic and then goes on to review the New York Philharmonic later in her career. Conflict of interest much? This was a disgusting read. The only reason why I gave it two stars instead of one was because it was entertaining."
1,Not impressive,"Tindall couldn't decide whether this book should be a personal dish-the-dirt expose, or an essay on the economics of classical music. On top of this, the writing was wooden and stilted.Arf! This book is a dog."
1,Not recommended...,"...first and foremost, Ms. Tindall simply isn't a very good writer...second, it's misleading -- it's not nearly as ""titillating"" as it's press leads one to believe...also, it's content can be summed up briefly in Ms. Tindall's own words: ""I'd never honestly been interested enough in the field to make it my career. I simply got hooked as a teenager because it earned me attention.""...and that's really all the book seems to be -- an effort to earn ""attention""...she does attempt to address issues regarding the with current situation in orchrestral/musician economics but the arguments and solutions presented are at best amateurish -- e.g. music schools need to reduce the number of graduates so as to reduce future competition between musicians...so much for aspiring performers, huh?...no, your money is better spent elsewhere."
4,A former musician living in Germany,"It's true that her writing is labored. True, too, that she's not at all likeable. Yet this sad and tawdry memoir captures--remarkably, even--the joyless life of the big-city loser-musician: bored, broke, and stoned, migrating from one low-rent gig to another, poorly educated, sexually exploitative, and psychically primitive. There is no glamour here; it is a story of arrested development and limited insight and Blair Tindall, alas, is its archetype. I know these people more than I care to acknowlege: I was one of them, briefly, and they haunt me in my dreams."
3,"Part autobiography, part expose","Decent prose for the most part, and an interesting subject. The author jumps around a bit chronologically, making the book a bit uneven. While I wouldn't characterize this as engrossing, it did hold my attention, and I'm glad I read it."
2,"Whiny, tedious","The novelty of the graphic sex scenes and descriptions of drug dens wears off pretty quickly and leaves very little behind. This book purports to be a ""fact-filled"" journalistic exposé, but degenerates into a long-winded, whiny complaint as Tindall spends most of the looking for people to blame her failures (both personal and professional) on. Her work playing for Broadway shows was ""repetitive"" -- give me a break! Whose job isn't repetitive? Just about the only revelation here is that work as a musician is just that -- work."
2,"Poorly written, narrow-minded, self-pitying","I have great sympathy for the author's plight, such as it was, having been through a narrow and non-remunerative graduate education myself. But Tindall seems entirely unaware that in every humanistic field American graduate schools produce far more graduates than the number of available jobs.Tindall has great stories, but she tells them so poorly that I was frequently unsure who exactly she was talking about, or when the events described took place. She writes ungrammatically and sloppily, in a voice devoid of any feelings except self-pity and anger.Journalistically, the book is a shambles. Tindall often uses quotes and statistics completely out of context. If she didn't write so poorly, I'd think she was being intentionally deceptive.If Tindall was the best writer on classical music the NY Times could find, then I'd have to agree with her, classical music is indeed in a sorry state."
4,Freelance Nightmare,"Mozart in the Jungle:A very interesting book. The book not only shows what it is like to be a musician in America but it is also a history book, a very easy to understand historical account of music in the United States."
4,NBA Microfiber Composite Ball,"The ball is good overall. One big issue, however, is that it picks up dirt quickly and becomes slippery to the hands then. You'll notice this well as your hands become dirty after using the ball for sometime. Yeah, I used it on a indoor wooden court :-)"
5,Great But Gone,I don't own the ball but my friend brought it to practice and it rocks. I can't palm a regular ball but with that one I was able to with the composite. It feels really soft and helps my release because I can hold it longer and get a better shot. Just don't use it outside or else it becomes black and is a regular outdoor ball. Try to get it on sale though don't spend $100.
1,NBA going to return to new ball.,"I just read an article at the Fox sports website saying it is almost certain that NBA will go back to using leather ball.There will not even be a bragging right once this officially happens, so in my opinion, don't buy it."
5,simply the best,"Okay, here is the deal. I have read a gazillion books on Thai massage. Okay, maybe not quite that many, but sometimes it feels like it. For a long time I wished and wished that someone would write a book that went beyond the initial basic sequence that is taught in so many schools. Then I found the Encyclopedia of Thai Massage. It led me to contact the author, train extensively with him, return to Thailand for even deeper training, and open a Thai massage school. Yes, this book was the catalyst for life change. Have I mentioned that it's the best one out there? Nothing nothing nothing replaces hands on training with a qualified teacher for learning Thai massage - books can be no more than reminders and supplemental material to real training. This said, Pierce's book is the best one out there in the english language that has yet been written."
4,Great book for the price,"This really is a great book. As we all probably know, nothing is as good as taking the classes themselves (i.e. Tai Chi, Yoga, Arts and crafts), but a close comparison. It does help if you have a decent understanding of anatomy, but not entirely to still be able to learn to do a decent Thai massage. I am a massage therapist myself, and was using this book to learn techniques to help with my massages, but may offer just Thai massage when I feel comfortable enough with the material presented in this book. Happy reading."
1,Boring !,"Tired old jokes that we have all seen before. Exactly the same as all his other books. Retire now and enjoy your fortune, Scott !"
1,complete junk,i thought that this book was terrible recycled topics and un-funny jokes so i give it 1 OUT OF 5 STARS. thank you.
4,Must read Book,"I made an error in my last ""review"". I said for people born in 1900. I meant it would make very interesting reading for those born in the 1900s & for family members who would like to know the world in which Grandparents lived. The true story of a young man, born to poor parents & his struggle to get an education & at times,just to survive. His book is full of colourful characters & takes us into a world where sometimes laughter was the only way to overcome disease, poverty & war.I heartily recomend this book, not only for reading pleasure but as an invaluable tool for the social history at that time."
2,DECEPTION,"These concerts are played in a mediocre way and worse, most of them are recorded in 1992 and remastered to SACD. All of them are remastered in Brazil and the results is really bad. THIS IS NOT SOUND FOR SACD at most for a common CD. The surround sound is not natural as expected."
1,"I, my son, and daughter in law hated it.",Was very disappointed in it !! Didn't even finish watching it. Really bad !! It was so stupid we stopped it.
4,overlooked `90s vibrance,"Chara has long been producing energetic pop music. In the early `90s, she outdid artists like Cyndi Lauper and Madonna with the albums `Sweet` and `Soul Kiss.` Her work is tender, imaginative, and completely unabashed."
4,Chara,"Chara's voice is an aquired taste. at times, childlike; other times, soaring. she has a certain Billy Holiday appeal to her voice and i could also see some fans of bjork's early material enjoying bits of this. the music is pop, but very well written and supremely produced pop. this album is from 1997 but still holds up well today. also, i love the cover and the design layout. so many cute little drawings and pictures...and Chara's smile is so adorable."
2,Not a Whole Lot of Substance,"My wife and I were gifted with this devotional book for Christmas several years ago. Each page of this daily devotional has a corresponding worship song. The lyrics from ninety inspiring songs are offered in the book. I like that part, but the devotionals themselves are pretty weak. This book is the second book of the Songs 4 Worship series, and it is a better fit for one of my sixth graders than it is for me."
4,"Really Super, Supergirl!","I really enjoy the Peter David/Gary Frank take on Supergirl. They have taken a fairly confusing background and created a distinct personality. Gary Frank has perfected her ""look."" There is no more costume changes or unnecessary fashion.Supergirl is one of my favorite characters and she is seldom given the respect she deserves. In this, the first nine issues of her solo series, she is given a chance to shine on her own. I miss Kara Zor-El, but this is a good substitute."
3,Interesting but choppy story,"I bought the book because I enjoy the work of Peter David, but was surprised to see the story was somewhat choppy, and a little difficult to follow. What I could follow was interesting, though. The story gives a good background on the current Supergirl. I just have memories of the original Supergirl comics from the 1960's, and I liked those stories."
4,An exercise video that actually works.,"This is a commonsense, plain vanilla exercise video that actually works. I followed the proscribed exercise course and wound up with ""no more back pain"". The exercise program is very easy to follow, and is suitable for any individual who suffers backpain. I highly recommend it."
5,No More Back Pain,"I had a ruptured disk in my back two years ago, and used this video to help recover. The information in the video about back injuries and how to treat them is excellent. The video presents a graduated set of exercises to use as your back recovers. It also gives advice on how to handle daily activities when you have an injured back."
2,Nice but too expensive,"$6.00 for three of them is quite a bit more than they should be. They are probably about the strongest magnet-tacks out there so if you have a need to hold up more than the average number of sheets of paper, and money is no object, it is nice to have a moderately strong magnet with a handle on it. You could get a MUCH stronger magnet for the same price but it would not have the convenient handle on it. Two dollars for each of these when you can get the smaller ones for about 15 cents (which I also reviewed) each just doesn't make sense to me. If you like the power of these and the ease of use the nice handle gives you, you could get a quarter inch by half inch magnet for a lot less and be stronger at the same time."
1,item is NOT as pictured!!!,I bought this assuming that I'd get what you see in the picture -- a sturdy brake pad spreader made entirely of metal. That's NOT what you'll get! You'll receive an item with a plastic knob instead!
1,PICTURE IS NOT THE RIGHT ONE,The one you received will be one with a plastic handle. It is totally different from the one in the picture. Do not buy if you are expecting the one in the picture!!!
1,Tricked,The picture used for this item is extremely misleading! What you see is not what you receive. Instead of an all metal handle what you really get is a cheap plastic turn knob. B.S.
3,"A must for "" exchange students""","I bought this book when I had foreign exchange students. It was hard to explain:1. "" thank you for sharing"": definition for I've heard enough...2. ""What I hear you saying"": Definition: I ( host mom) don't really hear what you are saying. I hear how I think you ought to say it. A device to get the questioner ( exchange student) to speed along so the faciliator (me) can speak some more.3. And then I bought it too.. cause I didn't know what the definition of a dork is ( a cool person)Thanks, I needed that."
5,How to talk like an American,"This is a book that is great for reading while waiting in the car or the doctor's office. I wish it were twice as extensive. I enjoy the placing of words in categories.When my family moved to Houston, TX from Fort Wayne, IN when I was 8, I noticed I couldn't understand older men at first. Part of this was accent; part of it was words. Cactus, y'all, dust storm, soda (we had pop) were just some of the words I had to learn. They just don't come up often here in Indiana. Some things were very different - no winter coats, no heavy sweaters; however, if you go into a store in Houston now, it looks exactly like one in Boston."
2,don't buy,"I loved it when I got it about 6 months ago. The problem is that the white ""ceramic"" is just painted stainless steel, and the paint will chip away. Also, the brush fell apart recentley. Go higher end, or go cheap. This was a waist on $$"
1,Poor Quality,"The item has a good heft and feel to it. However, the stand was wobbly out of the box due to a loose nut in the base. The only way to tighten it up is to remove the felt covering on the base. The base began to show rust within a month of using it. I am very disappointed in this purchase."
2,Falls Apart,"Everything looks nice on the stand, but it all fell apart when I tried to use the set to actually shave. For one, the razor is held together by a length of all-thread running down the middle that is little too short. I'll replace it with a longer piece from the hardware store when I get a chance. In the mean time, I'm using a different razor to shave with. Also, the brush keeps losing bristles. This is only the second shaving brush that I've owned, so I don't know if that's normal for a breaking-in period, but the first brush I owned didn't do that (Tweezerman brand)."
1,Missing item,"I ordered this item on November 19, 2012 for a price of $66.00. Item was missing the razor handle; vendor refunded $20.00 towards cost of handle. I am now the owner of an incomplete razor kit. I also just discovered the price of this item has now dropped to $46.00."
3,Decent,After using this shaving set for about a year and a half the badger brush separated. Changing out the razor blades is now difficult as the mount that holds the razor falls off the holder. The set looks good however I should have spent the extra money to purchase a good quality one.
5,Great value,"I will tell you that for 40 bucks this is a fantastic starter set for the new to wet shaving crowd. It's fun to read the critics claims that this product may not be a good deal,I will tell you it is not a $200 silver tip badger brush nor does it contain a good quality gillette adjustable safety razor,but is it a great value for the money,yes. If you are just getting into the wet shaving arena give it a try.if this is replacing your current set up then don,t bother,you will be happier building yor set piece by piece like I am doing,"
3,"Cute and fun, but presents some issues","I chose this bedding for my infant son. I still love the pattern and colors, but would probably not choose it again. The color scheme is very difficult to find coordinating pieces for - all baby things seem to come in pastel pink, blue, or green - none of which go with the modern color scheme of this bedding. I managed to find a couple of things that went with it, but buying things like window treatments, crib sheets, storage bins, changing pad covers, and a rug would have been MUCH easier if we had gone with a bedding set with a more traditional color palette.Also, I really wish these items were sold as separates. For safety reasons, we did not use the bumper. The crib sheet that comes with it isn't anything special, and after 8 months, we really haven't yet gotten much use out of the blanket, either. (I hope to use the blanket more when he is a toddler. So I basically got a $200 crib skirt and paid extra for the window valance."
2,Not Pleased,i paid extra to get this book in 5 days and it's still not here. it has been almost a week. if i have to wait any longer i'm going to return this book. i have homework to do and i can't do it because i don't have what i need. i'm not pleased at all. i hope this book gets here as soon as possible i really need it.
1,Fuel gauge,"Equus 2"" Fuel Level Gauge.This might be a good item. If i could get it to work. No place have i found what OHMS this gauge covers. Not on the gauge and not on the web site. No, i would not buy again.s i still have this one, i can not return."
5,"After Listening to It for 20 Years, I still Love It!","This album is definitely what Dead Kennedys was all about. Raw, straight-forward, honest, fast, and furious. After listening to it for 20 years, I still love it. Call it punk, call it whatever you want, the first time you hear ""Lets Lynch the Landlord"", you'll know that this band meant business and not just out there to go with the tide of that era called punk. Try California Uber Alles, and Chemical Warfare; you'll love it. Get this CD."
4,Yes! Someone else got it!,"Congrads, ""you morons"", you win the grand prize. As I read comment after comment following the review, I was afraid no one else was going to figure out Fred Dursts Number One Fan's remarks. You guys didn't honestly think that was real, did you?And by the way, Dead Kennedys are the masters of irony and satire.Jello would have gotten it."
5,Viva Las Vegas,I got this album in 1988 along with an album by Peter and the Test Tube Babies. It is the best album ever to come out in hardcore punk. Viva Las Vegas is a Gem.
5,Essential album for your collection,"The Dead Kennedys ""Fresh Fruit for Rotting Vegetables"" is essential for your collection if you love punk or have the slightest interest in this exciting time in music. I was at work in the '80s and overheard a friend singing, ""Kill the Poor."" I ran out and bought the album -- my first punk album -- and was hooked. It's not the over-produced ""punk"" of today. This is the band that influenced today's ""punk"" bands. It's stripped down, fast, intense and managed to offend just about everyone when it came out. Just LISTEN to the lyrics and you'll pick up the message Jello was spreading about the times, and he did it with humor and no apologies. It's a short album but worth every penny."
1,No Jello Biafra? GARBAGE,"""The video omits references to the origins of songs that would include a mention of Jello Biafra""That is some hardcore stupidity. How about a nirvana documentary with out Kurt Cobain?"
5,Classic DK,"What an album, finally got this on cd after having it on vinyl and cassette. Every track makes me want to start a riot. Too bad some new bands wouldn't speak out like DK did. F@#$in brilliant!"
3,probably best album....,"dead kennnedys are pretty good and i like them, but they sound alot like a lot of other punk bands and akot of other punk band sound alot like them, a common problem in punk rock...however despite this downfall they are unique enough to be a quite good band, so if your looking for a new band or another dead kennedys album, this is probably the way to go, consedering in my opinion at least this is there best album......"
1,Looking Forward to Death... while listening to this album.,"First off, where's the Mutt Lange producing? Awful sound... everyone knows that the slicker it sounds, the more punk it is (take Green Day's ""American Idiot"" for example). Once you get past the initial shock of the goatboy whaling vocals, you'll realize that there isn't enough about suburban angst and too much anarchist claptrap. Anarchist punks? How original! I wish there would be a right-wing punk scene.. sigh. Anywho, everything here seems to be taken out of the ""How To Be a Punk"" Wikihow page, almost verging into the ""poser"" territory.Save yourself the headache and listen to Blink-182, Sum 41, The Offspring or Bowling For Soup instead."
1,More Boring Communist Punk,"Mr. Biafra seems to think that corrupting the minds of children through loud music is somehow more noble than property ownership. It is interesting that Mr. Biafra sells his C.D.'s. He expects landlords to give away their property to any unemployed 18 year old who wants it but then turns around and charges 15 bucks to the same kid for his record. Is is because Mr. Biafra has to eat and landlords don't? Oh forget it. Let's not think, let's just rock."
1,This album sounds cheap,"THe dead kennedys talk too much about polotics in their music, if I wanted to here polotics I would turn on C-span. Thank you with much thought Look Out Rec. I.D. Tim"
2,Evryone else likes them,"OK i'm not saying that Dk is a bad group. I'm saying for some reason I don't like them. First of all I don't understand the meaning behind tracks like ""Kill the Poor"" and ""I Kill Childern"". Are they trying to be funny? Their lead singer sounds like he is trying to be Jonny Rotten(sex Pistles). I don't see how this band is polliticle. If you like hearing songs about killing childern this Albem is for you. Anyway I don't like DK but it seams evryone else does."
1,terrible tripe,"these guys think they are SO important, that everyone cares what they have to say. Well you know what, they are obsolete and did more bad than good, just like all of punk music! all you whiny people should just stop buying hair gel and get a real job. Or go get London Calling instead of this mop bucket slop!!"
5,Is it any less relevant now?,"Grew up in the late 70's early 80's and heard many of the old school bands but the DK's were and are different. Put this on be prepared to have your senses assaulted and your attitude changed for the better. The best album by one of the great bands. With the addition of the early singles all I can say is, who feels it knows it. George W could use a listen....."
5,Classic!,"The Dead Kennedys were so ahead of their time.why they may offend some, their music is great for all."
5,definitely a classic,"I just want to say that this album helped me appreciate the DK's more than any other album, and I own them all. It wasn't the first one I bought, but it is definitely my favorite. So if you are haven't bought this album, then do so immediately. If you have bought it, then you already know what I'm talking about."
5,Classic,"Nothing to really say. This album is one of the greatest punk albums ever, right up there with the Clash's London Calling, Ramones's s/t, Sex Pistols' Never Mind.., and Social D's Mommy's Little Monster (I could go on, you know). The only question is... why don't you own it already?"
5,what would we do without the DKs?,"First, I have to give my input on the GC fan's review--if you do not like this Dead Kennedys album, you do not like, as you put it ""tru punk acts."" The Dead Kennedys are a classic punk band, and this is by far their best album. When I first heard ""Kill the Poor"" and ""Holiday in Cambodia,"" I knew this would end up being one of the best albums I've ever owned. There isn't a single song I didn't like, and the CD is constantly in my stereo. So if you REALLY want to listen to some great punk rock (other than that corporate emo junk) then definitely check out this album, it's one of the best."
5,Dead Kennedys best,"This is truly something different. I can not think of one other band that sounds like the DKs. Not only does this music sound good, but it makes you think. Of course, many of Jello's lyrics are dated, but that doesn't seem to take much away from the album. So any of you that want to buy this CD, I also recommend Fugazi, Minor Threat, Black Flag, and the Sex Pistols. Also, you should probably buy this CD from the record label, since it will be cheaper for you and the band gets more money. www.alternativetentacles.com"
1,Great CD,"I love this cd and Jello Biafra's style... which is why u shouldnt buy this cd these arent the original songs, after biafra split the other band members took parts out and made them a weak imatation to the original. so download this and dont support greedy musicians besides isnt that what DK wanted?"
2,The Left Will Never Find Happiness,"I bought this new, back some twenty years ago (jeez). I thought the single ""California Uber Alles"" was the funniest thing since Jerry Brown changed his linen. But by the time the album came out, with the band becoming Involved and Serious and Relevent, it just became tedious, lefty bilge-water. Jello shouldn't run for mayor, he should run for a job."
2,S#@% Sandwich,"I just don't remember why I was so in love with this record. I've certainly not grown up much since it came out but listening to this crap now makes me embarrassed for myself. Jello's facile, by-the-book* brand of sedition may be earnest but it does not make up in enthusiasm what it lacks in sophistication. That said, this is the best DK ever created...truly a milestone in the context of an inchoate genre (*-it would be criminal to forget that Jello pretty much WROTE the book). Would be listenable from a nostalgic standpoint if only the associated teething pains didn't make me cringe."
3,A Close Second,"This was my second DK album after Convenience or Death...and I am glad it was so. This album is probably more characteristically DK than the compilation album, which means there are some good songs and some not so good songs. It was okay, but not necessarily for the casual fan, like me."
5,The best DK album ever released,"Kill the Poor was the best, sarcastic punk songs ever written in the history of punk music, and the songs California Uber Alles and I Kill Children are simply mind blowing."
4,DK Forever,"One of the last great punk bands, The Dead Kennedys have always been awesome.I recommend this album to anyone that loves new punk and wants to listen to real music or anyone that is just a punk fan.In fact, I recommend any DK album."
5,Punk found a way to scream at the world!!,"When DK released this album, punk was on it's way to finally letting the aggression come out in great songs like, "" When Ya Get Drafted"" and "" Holiday in Cambodia""! Not only did they make their point, but made it with lyrics that proved their point and you can't get out of your head! I've had this album for about 3 years now, and I can't get over how great it is. If you're thinking about getting a Dead Kennedy's album, but aren't sure which one to get, this is it! Biafra really worked hard to get his point in their music. Although there are a couple of ""snore"" songs, like, "" Let's Lynch the Landlord"", this album kicks ass! Unlike Frankenchrist, or others, DK was just starting, so they sound greater, noisier and angrier than ever!This is a must-have for punks, or anyone that likes politically-charged music everywhere!"
2,No Fangs???,"I can't believe what a nothing video this is! It started off with a pretty interesting story, but then it just sloweddown. I kept waiting for the fangs to come out....but nothing! I never have seen a vampire story with nofangs shown! How stupid!.....Don't waste your money."
3,radio Ginny,The material is taken from radio shows and songs from movies Ginny performed. A little surface noise is heard but then sometimes this is excepted from old radio transcriptions. The main problem is the tempo rarely changes. Ginny had her way with a ballad but she could swing too. Ginny Simms had a rich voice and this is worth searching for.
5,A book for the real world of teaching,"Schempp provides a very applied, but research based approach to teaching sport and physical activity. This is a great book for those aspiring to teach in any activity setting - from public school physical education, to recreation centers, to youth sport contexts, or even those working with young adults and seniors in various physical activit or sport settings.It is grounded in the real world of teaching and provides wonderful examples of teachers and coaches for others to emulate.I recommend this book without reservation.Thomas J. Templin"
4,Unraveling the DNA Mystery,Dawkins is a fine reader-friendly writer who carefully uses logic and the mathematics of probabilty - in an easy way - to deduce the philosophical goal of the DNA genes found in nature. It is very thought provoking if you are the sort who like to have your thoughts provoked. This is a companion book to his Blind Watch-maker book that examines the DNA goal from a different viewpoint.
5,Don't buy the hardcover! Go find the paperback page!,"This book should live in every drawer of every hotel room in the world. The one true ""meaning of life"" is contained within -but be prepared, you may never see things the same. We, and all animals, are disposable vehicles for the blind selfishreplicators called genes. Forget about the Celestine Prophecies - This is reality. You will believe. For excerpts, reviews,articles, interviews and much more please visit my RICHARD DAWKINS WEBSITE at: --->http://www.spacelab.net/~catalj <---| John Catalano"
4,Fresh perspective & clear writing,"Dawkins' writing style is exceptionally clear and concise. His arguments provide a fresh perspective even after 30 years. I find the book a must read for those who enjoy some fresh explanations on how and why 'selfish' behaviors exist in all life forms on Earth. [Similar to the Chinese Tao philosophy.] It certainly challenges one's long held belief and myths on human nature(religious or otherwise.) I suspect that's why reviews here are either very positive or very negative. Judge for yourself...even if you don't like the arguments, the ideas are well presented."
2,Unsophisticated Writing masks Good Science,"Dawkins has an interesting and valid thesis in his book. Evolutionary psycology proves to be a compelling and meaningful field. ""The Selfish Gene"", however, does not communicate it justly. Dawkins relies too heavily on analogies and his convoluted writing style oversimplifies many issues to the point of incredibility. I would recommend, far more quickly, ""The Moral Animal"" by Robert Wright. It proves more persuasive through a greater use of examples and studies, rather than analogies. There is no doubt, however, that this science is fundamental to human existence and self-awareness."
2,What the...?!,"While this book presents concepts that are interesting enough, it's overuse of metaphors and analogies makes it almost unreadable. The author poses a perfectly legitimate argument and then attempts to defend it with 5 pages of nonsensical jargon. It is enough to make one retire the book prematurely in frustration. On several occasions I found myself asking, ""What exactly was the point of this rambling again?"" Quite frankly, his tactics are peevish and tiresome.I have a better idea Mr. Dawkins. Instead of trying to bring science into the realm of the layman and blathering endlessly and needlessly about it, rewrite this book. This time around omit your attempts to dumb it down. I am betting you could trim it to a mere essay. But then, you could hardly market an essay could you?I would be absolutely infuriated if this book were made required reading for say, an entry level genetics course. Mr. Dawkins is exactly what is wrong with science today."
2,Words mean things,"To those who say don't sweat the semantics, words are all we have in this argument. Getting them right is all important. No, genes aren't selfish. No genes aren't independent. No genes do not have behavior. Genes translate into behavior, through nonlinear dynamics. The basic postulate of evolutionary stable strategies that Dawkins invokes is now in question in the scientific literature -- in peer reviewed journal papers -- read them. But if you'd rather steep yourself in pseudointellectualism, accepting arguments from authority, then don't bother and give this book 5 stars."
4,Why 'popular science' is 'popular',"'The Selfish Gene' is the perfect book for the layperson if he or she wants to come to grips with modern evolutionary theory. For a start, it is clear and easy to follow. Secondly, it is highly interesting and educational, and it constantly kept me turning the pages to find out more. This book explains what the 'survival of the fittest' is really all about - with life as we know it perhaps really only being a matter of the genes' own survival. It is another one of those books from which you both learn and retain a lot of information. With some nice explanations - including a thorough discussion on 'The Prisoners' Dilemma', an almost sociological look at possible balances of 'selfish' Vs 'altruistic' genes, and other such things that you can take away to discuss with your friends - this is definitely the right book for anyone interested in popular science. It is also the book for anyone who is still in doubt as to how 'science' could ever be termed 'popular'."
5,A jewel to understand animal behavior and evolution.,"This book should be readed by anybody who likes biology, specially etology (study of animal behavior), and evolution, it is really an eye opener to the why of so many strange animal functions, from the most basic self perpetuation to the most complex, beauty genes, sexual and agression reactions, and why the human is in most cases a really strange and contradictory animal. On the second and, I guess, later editions there is a final chapter that introduces the term memes, with which the author tries to explain some of the human behavior using his theory."
5,Very Important Book,"The Selfish Gene is incredibly well written. It is hard to imagine how such complicated concepts in mathematical biology & behavioral ecology can be explained in such a simple and direct way. It is not an 'easy' read by any means, but if you follow Dawkin's explaination patiently, you will be well rewarded. SG may even 'change your life', an experience other reviewers have had. The idea is that all organisms, humans included, are the living exteriors or replicating machines of DNA. Read it because Dawkin's uses unusual & interesting examples from the animal world to back up the concepts in this book. Read the book to find out what some of the implications of this idea are for us. Finally, read it b/c the book is always lively, well-written, painstakingly thourough and revolutionary all at the same time."
1,Bypassed by science,"I first read this book when it came out in 1976. It had a certain appeal then. However, since then science has faslsified essentially all the scientific claims in the book. For example, gene sequencing of dozens of species has shown that the Darwinian straight-line descent of species from an original cell is wrong, that instead of a `tree of life' there is a `web of life' (see Scientific American, February 2000). This and other advances in chemistry and biology nullify the arguments about gene inheritance that the author attempts to make. Further the pop psychology underlying the author's treatment of human behavior is no longer in favor in that profession. This leaves the book as a useful guide to Dr. Dawkins's religious beliefs. I would recommend the book to anyone for whom that is an interesting subject."
5,Buy this book.,"This is an amazing book. Brilliantly written and brilliantly thought out. Contrary to the people who have reviewed this before me and see the book as doom laden for humans, I dont think it leaves one with a terrible view of mankind at all. This book simply explains the way life is, and how it got there. Dawkins doesnt say anywhere that ""humans are naturally selfish and there is nothing you can do about"", nor does he imply it(for the pedants out there). And he also doesnt say that that genes have a conscience and are knowingly selfish. Ignore the hype that has surrounded the title and read about life in all its marvellous glory!"
5,book which made me an Atheist,"""Selfish gene"" is the book which made me become an Atheist finally. Similar to another reviewer, I was very depressed after reading this book; I too wished I could unread it. too late! But I think it is better to know the truth and be depressed than happy and ignorant.It removes naive optimism of the youth that everyone is nice and good. Know the truth - Every one is selfish ""ultimately"" - Even the most altruistic soul in the world."
