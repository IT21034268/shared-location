1,This is poor,"I bought this because i also had a 1000 series all-in-one a few years back and it worked great back in those days. Sadly this printer does not live up to its predecessors... like... not even close. Although printing speed is faster and the quality standard, it's harder to use because the software is slow with confusing interface and takes up alot of memory for simple tasks. but the worst part is that, the paper wont even feed. and if it does it jams or takes a couple of paper in at the same time and prints all over them. each time i had to keep pressing resume about twice. never again with HP... i'm dissapointed. something so simple became so hard"
2,Seriously disgusted,"Got this printer in Nov, and it's been nothing but trouble. Ink goes way too fast. This printer is incapable of picking up a sheet of paper. It will pick up the whole stack, or pick up one and jam. The only way to get one sheet out whole is to manually feed it in.As that's the reason I bought a new one (the old HP) had to be hand-fed, I'm not a happy camper. This piece of junk is going back to the store tomorrow."
5,good stuff,"This a very good printer for girls, so i bought for my honey, she like it very much. Thanks Amazon give me a nice price."
1,DO NOT BUY THE HP Psc 1510,PAPER DOES NOT FEED ... YOU HAVE TO BABY-SIT IT AND PUSH IT IN ONE SHEET AT A TIME.Scans fine and Pints 4x6 photo paper fine. But the 8.5 X 11 paper feeder is a joke.And now it looks like they repaced it with the HP Photosmart C3180 All in One Printer/Scanner/Copier.I would BEWARE of both!
1,Rip Off!!!,"I had no technical problems with this printer. HOWEVER...do NOT buy this printer unless you are printing a couple of pages per year! I'm now on my second black ink cartridge and I haven't even printed 200 pages yet! For the price of this cartridge, this just doesn't make sense.And, yes, it frequently pulls several pages through at once which makes it next to impossible to print two sided documents...not to mention running out of ink in the middle of your print job.I got rid of a nice new Epson all in one printer simply because I felt it was a rip off of Epson when I ran out of red ink, it wouldn't print at all, even though the other cartridges were full! I bought this printer based on review at cnet.com..bad mistake!Printers have become the another new sign of corporate greed."
2,"GOOD PRINTER, Just doesn't last long","I bought this printer less than 2 years ago, the inkis affordable, the copies and pics come out nice, themajor downfall, is the printer just broke and its only1 1/2 years old....something happened internally withthe print cartridge cradle (no error on my part) andnow its broken. I wish i read these reviews b4 buyingthis."
3,Seems good..so far,"I just picked up this printer used today. Im not sure about the print quality, that's because it's out of black ink, but still has a little tri-color left in it. Im hoping to use refill cartridges(?) in the future to save money. As per some of the previous reviews, I understand I will need a higher quality paper than just copier paper, so I plan to get some of that to start. A couple issues with the software that I had are worth mentioning. The HP Photosmart Studio software I downloaded from HP for Mac initially froze every time I tried to do something with the scans. It turns out one of the processes it does kills your processor. It's called keyword albums. You have to modify a .plist file or else delete it. I deleted it and the Photosmart software seems to be working fine now."
2,it sucks,I have this printer for a year. At the begining it worked fine. Though I never checked how many pages it printed. But now it's money eating machine. It prints about 20-30 pages and runs out of ink. Or if you print a few pages you can go shopping for a new package of ink because it's not gonna be enough for another print.
1,extremely unreliable,"The first problem with this printer is the hp software that comes with it. You must install a program that always runs in the background called the ""digigal imaging monitor"" this program causes our computer to run slowly and refuses to end itself about 50% of the time, causing the computer to freeze. Also, the printer itself always misfeeds or jams or feeds all the paper through, and you must constantly stand next to it and make sure the paper feeds correctly. Don't be fooled if it works well for the first few days, it will eventually break like it did for everyone else who wrote a review. It amazes me that a brand like HP would sell a piece of s*** like this."
3,Generic Size Case,Looking for a hard case for my Magnum drill and accessories. This case is really for the hammer drill so the Magnum is a bit small for the space.Not many case choices with Milwaukee but it works.
3,Cute Phone Booth,"This Bratz phone booth is cute. I'm sure you're kids will love it. I personally think that paying over 10 dollars is north worth it, though."
2,THIS PHONE BOOTH IS ABSOLUTE RUBBISH!,I hate this!! The phone keeps on falling off and the door is super hard to open!! It's too hard to make the dolls use the phone- ABSOLUTE RUBBISH is a useless toy.
4,Concise and to the Point,"If you want to become a billionaire, then this is your book. Goes through the history of financial titans and breaks down how they amassed their wealth by finding common strategies that you can also implement."
3,Never Finished,"Good book but really ended up not interesting myself as much as I thought it would, and I have honestly never finished it. Also felt like it tells you that in order to be a billionair you must be unethical."
1,Not for everyone...,"I was quite amused how some locals bought the book hoping the author's would enlight them with something realistic. The book is not for the general public and most of the solutions are basic financial management. I didn't bother buying the book since it was available at my local library. For those wanting inspiration to make a business, go for it and read this book."
2,Not What You Are Thinking,"The book, How to Be a Billionaire, is not a how to book as the title suggests. I got more out of how to become rich by reading books such as think and grow rich."
5,Nancy Drew takes on the Big Apple!,"How could anybody as nice as Nancy Drew find trouble on a fabulous trip to New York City -- especially with a girl she's never met before?Nancy's aunt has taken Nancy, Bess and George to Manhattan. In the biggest department store they've ever seen, a snooty stranger snatched a beautiful fashion doll right out of Nancy's hands claiming it was hers. To avoid an argument, Nancy let's her take it. Who would ever expect that they'd meet again at a spook-tacular theme restaurant -- and the argument would begin in earnest!It's going to be tough for Nancy to crack the case of Trouble Takes the Cake in a strange city. But, with her trusty blue notebook, she is sure to solve it all before the last page.Carolyn Keene has written another book of this splendid series, sure to turn all who read it into lifetime learners and readers. Kudos, Nancy Drew and friends!"
5,Excellent Information!,Great information that every woman should know and delivered in a very understandable format. Will be recommending this book (and probably buying additional copies) for all my female friends and family!
3,Extreme vegan program,"The description of this book didn't prepare me. This is a radical approach, which will undoubtedly be effective for people who are suffering serious health issues. But ""every woman""? I don't think so. Can ""every woman"" live without any animal products at all, any oil, any wheat . . . it goes on and on. Only those who are really ill with food sensitivities will want to take this on. Although I can guarantee any woman who follows the program will lose weight!"
5,Excellent guidance,John McDougall provides women with a wealth of information on important health issues. These issues have plagued women for years for which doctors would prefer to not explain alternative health measures. Dr. McDougall's information is 100% effective and scientifically proven. I am very grateful to finally be armed with the facts.
1,Terrible,This product is built from something that's not steel. it might be aluminum. The teeth on this key all bent in on turn. Don't buy I couldn't give it negative 5 stars.
5,Amazing,Talk about awsome. This antenna combined with a 4 watt midland CB can transmit over 15 miles. It the most durable antenna I have ever seen as well. This is the best antenna you will ever get
1,No whip and I got a used one with stripped set screw threads,"Im sure its a great antenna. It dont come with a whip and the one I got was obviously used and it has stripped whip set screw threads...thanks a lot seller. Id send it back but I need it now so I'll have to tap out the thread hole, find a new set screw and find a whip too.Ive been outfitting my car with a trunking scanner and a CB. Im faced with the most dishonest sellers ever lately. I would find someplace else to find mobile radio equipment if I were you, Im getting hustled left and right trying to buy this stuff. So, beware."
1,Retraso en entrega a mi buzón,"La compre hace una semana y aun no lo entregan en mi buzon de miami,ese mismo dia realice otras compras que ya estan en venezuela, quisiera saber porque se han tardado tanto.Este es mi productoK40 K-40 57.25"" Base Load CB Antenna Kit with Stainless Steel Whip and Black/Red K40 LogoK40 K-40 57.25"" Base Load CB Antenna Kit with Stainless Steel Whip and Black/Red K40 Logosaludos"
3,10 Meter use with K-40 antenna,"Sence I purchaced the K-40,I have use it on 10 meters with no problems. A little trimming is nessary to bring the K-40 into resonance for low SWR. Otherwise it works well."
1,Item received defective.,Antenna arrived in good shape with no noted damage. Open connection or short would not allow transmit or receiving. Radio tested with alternate antenna and works fine. I will go with a Wilson for my replacement.
3,Problems out of the box,"The K40 overall is a good antenna. The recieve and transmit is awesome. I had some trouble out of the box. The PL259 on the Coax was intermittent causing severe SWR problems until I replaced the PL259 and the SWR settled down to about 1.9. Not an excellent standing wave, but that has more to do with my vehicle and the antenna placement than the antenna itself.Too bad the PL259 connector was intermittent or I would have rated this much higher. One shouldn't have to replace a connector on a brand new coax. Connectors are not that hard to put on and get right. Damned crimped connections instead of SOLDER like it should be."
5,Looks to be a fine buy.,I received this on the 7th of February and was pleased with what looks to be a fine Antenna. I have not tried it out yet as I was waiting for the Magnet mount.
3,"good resource, yet outdated.","This was purchased for a college class, I feel there are more up to date materials that can be used in place of this book."
1,Disappointed,"I was disappointed in the architecture program I purchased because it apparently is an outdated program that does not allow for furniture placement in a room. There were no downloads that I could find to insert furniture and what was in the program was limited to windows, doors and types of walls and flooring."
1,Do NOT buy this product!,"This program is deceptively packaged so that it appears to do a wide range of building and designing tasks. In truth, the only thing it does is draw a basic floor plan-- no interior design, no interior remodeling, no landscaping, nothing. No where on the product is this stated. In fact, the tutorial TELLS you that the program has landscaping and interior design capabilities. And, it cannot be returned because it is a computer program. So I am complaining to the company. I encourage others who have been mislead to do the same."
2,Drawing,This is not what I wanted. It does not work with Autocad like version 4.0. Yes you can import the drawing into Autocad but you can not use the drawing. It appears that after version 4 3D home stop working with Autocad. Great for 3d work and independant designs but I need to get software where I can start a drawing easily and complete the difficult task in Autocad.
1,This is a bate program! NOT a good buy.,if you want to do much with this program it requires you buy more stuff for it to get to a complete design. it is only good for walls and outlines and not that great at that.
1,3d Home architect,"This software was sent to me as a $9.95 software package. I thought it would be ""no frills"" software, it turned out to be the ""lite"" version, and basically incomplete for my needs. Overall it does not do the job. I had the original 3D home architect which was a fine product, this new one pales by comparison. Indeed virtually worthless. There was no indication that this would be the ""lite"" version.I am sorely disapointed.Further I am getting telemarketing calls using Broderbunds name to sell ""junkware""! Overall, a extreme disapointment."
2,teaser,"Tells about being able to add furniture, and other features... but it's not included in this version of the program."
1,Smells like a fake!,"Beware! It looks like it has nothing to do with the real Versace product. I took my product to a local shopping mall and compared the scents....I don't know how this is possible, but I am deeply disppointed!"
5,Awesome,"I needed some Nice perfume so i started doing my own research and i got to know of Versace Dreamer. I went for this and i tell you i wasn't disappointing, the smell was so good that my girl was like only this perfume when me and her going out together."
3,It's An Okay Fragrance...,"I saw some good reviews on ""Dreamer by Versace."" However, when I received the package and opened it up, I didn't like the fragrance. It's a different scent than the norm, but it's too strong. Almost like a woman's perfume. The more I wore it, the more indifferent I became to it. Sometimes I liked it, other times I didn't. I would only wear this to switch up my fragrance collection. Definitely wouldn't recommend this as a signature scent!"
5,IRRESISTIBLE AA++,"Ok, I have to put this in writing. Dreamer is one of TWO colognes that I have -and I have well over a hundred (of the designer brands, not the teen and cheap stuff) -Dreamer absolutely drives women mad. I have never had ONE ever NOT want to turn into ""vampira"" on me with this on. The only other one that even comes close to evoking this response is ""NightFlight"" by Joop and it's discontinued and hard to get. I'm telling you gentleman: Invest in a bottle of this, let everyone ask you what it is you are wearing: If you wear it; they (women) will come. Seriously."
2,Item is not what it appears,"I was excited to order this cologne. I have used it for about 10 years. Retail outlets have stopped carrying this product, so I figured I would check it out on Amazon. The picture and description match the bottle I have always purchased. What arrived at my house is ""Versace The Dreamer,"" but it is not what is pictured, and it definitely smells different and much weaker. If you like the real ""The Dreamer"" don't get this, because its something totally different and you will be deeply disappointed. I'd rather pay full price and get the real thing."
5,The Winner,"read reviews on You tube (Marc), and bought it out of curiosity. Blew me out of the water. Clearly one of my top three scents of all time and that's saying a lot because over the years I've accumulated enough cologne to start my own mail order business. Truly remarkable, Versace has out done themselves with this one!"
4,Another piece of Britain's unique brand of Metal,"Many people see Thrash Metal as a sound that orbited around the first US American exponents of the genre, but German and British Metal developed their own unique sound. In the British counterpart, many bands where strongly influenced by the D-beat Hardcore sound of bands such as Discharge or the Varukers. Onslaught's debut is a fine example of it. For some it must sound raw, monotone, and even unoriginal, but their one of the first examples -with Sacrilege- of that Metal sound hailing from England that could not escape what was sonically going on there in the early eighties. If you want a Thrash Hardcore-laden sound, Power from Hell is for you. And you might also wanna try some Sacrilege and Bolt Thrower's first album."
5,Up the Irons!,"Finally, for once the U.S. version of a Maiden single is actually better than its UK and Europe versions. This is definately worth the buy because Hallowed Be Thy Name never sounded so much better. It is worth buying solely for that purpose because Hallowed Be Thy Name is an awesome recording on this CD. The UK and Europe versions of this same CD have another live recoding of Iron Maiden on it...I love Maiden I have seen them play over 20 times here in California and in Europe, but please I don't need to hear another live version of Iron Maiden...having saying that this CD is definately worth the buy and if you are a die hard fan than find a way to get the UK version of this as well as it has a live photo of the band during the Matter of Life and Death tour. Unlike the U.S. version which only has the cover of Eddie."
5,Mitici Iron,"Come sempre gli Iron non deludono. Lo so, sono di parte, però questo singolo non può mancare nella collezione di un loro fan che si rispetti. Molto bella la copertina con Eddie più incacchiato che mai! La title track è molto orecchiabile anche se poco ""ruvida"" rispetto alle songs del passato. Proprio per questo sono presenti altri 2 pezzi mitici: Hallowed be thy name e The Trooper, nelle versioni radio edit. Se non conoscete gli Iron vi farete un'idea molto precisa di cosa hanno rappresentato e di cosa ancora possono fare, ovvero dare emozioni!"
1,This Game Blows!!!,"Total amateurs designed this one. If you like running around for 10 minutes looking for the action then this game is for you....BORING!!! Then when you finally find some action it's over just when you get there. Sometimes you can shoot a guy dead on like 4 times and he won't go down. Other times 1 hit and he's in the ground. This makes for much wasted ammo. And if you reload before your mag is empty you lose the half empty mag, instead of keeping it until your almost out. Slow reload times and slow weapons changes. All in all, terribly boring. What's with having an insertion point all the way on the other side of the map from the action? I hate running through the entire map, by myself, looking for a fight."
2,Too much prose for a straight forward basketball bio,"Though well versed and literate, I felt David Halberstam should leave out lofty prose for more direct basketball commentary."
3,Playing for keeps:Michael Jordan and the world he made,"I really enjoyed my book. It was a great book. I would recommend it to young adults and fans of Michael Jordan. It was worded a little unique and it is very long.It seems like little kids wouldn't like it at all. I don't think too many young adults would like the book but i would prefer it to young adults or adults.I gave this book 3 out of 5 stars because it isn't a good book for just anyone to read but it is still an awesome book. I think that there are many changes that would've made the book a lot better. I think if the book would've been shorter and written more to the point then it would be awesome. I think that the book is only exciting because the amazing things that Michael Jordan does. I think it gets more interesting in the middle because it shows pictures of him as a child, his house, and in high school. I think that adult fans should buy this book. It is great!"
3,"Lukewarm, disappointing","This is better than most sports books, but worse than most Halberstam books. His reseach is clearly top-notch, but the writing is somewhat uneven. Insight into how teams are built and how the get along is great. On the whole, I'd recommend readers skim this book for the good stuff. Many parts just aren't that well done."
2,2nd rate Halberstam,"If you are a basketball fan and simply want some some more information into to the life and times of Jordan, enjoy this breezy read. But if you expecting Halberstam's usually articulate and excellent insights into American life as seen through Jordan's life, you will probably be disappointed. As much as I admire Halberstam, his efforts here belong in the ABA."
5,A historical document,"This books chronicles the transformation of Michael Jordan, and basketball, from sport to business.In retrospect, the book's title says it all.It is an amazing description of Michael Jordan's transcendence, yes, but also how the competitiveness that drove him was used (by himself and the corporate NBA) for private gain. And the cost it exacted on the greater good of the ""game"" as a game, and not a profit-making enterprise."
4,Solid analysis,"The debate is nil when it comes down to who was the most influential athlete in the last half of the 20th century, yet the world Michael Jordan created has never been analyzed as well as Halberstam does.I believe Halberstam's assessment that Jordan might have had more money than many countries, but he never let his basketball suffer because of it. Unfortunately, the narcissistic world Jordan created has led to ""tall millionaires fighting short millionaries,"" referring to players constantly wanting more money from their rich owners.With the emergence of Jordan, the concept of team in the NBA has gone competely out the window. Yes, Jordan's crass behavior toward his teammates was meant as motivation. Clearly Jordan is portrayed accurately as one of the most driven athletes ever, but who was he ultimately looking out for? No. 23."
3,Good but not great,"I enjoyed the book but I didn't learn much that was new. I'm a big basketball fan and I've followed Jordan's career since I first saw him play in college. I expected the book to provide fresh insight into the man, but I was disappointed. If I could read only one book about Jordan it would be ""The Jordan Rules"" by Sam Smith. Nonetheless, if you are a basketball fan, I would recommend this book."
1,out of bounds,"I didn't like the comments about Rodaman and Ron Harper. Good anecdotes, but failed to score on the rebound."
4,Great book!,David Halberstam wrote a great book on Michael Jordan. It gives us a different look at the world's most popular athlete and about his incredible desire and willpower to be at the top of his game and set a higher standard for himself and his teammates. Read it!
5,outstanding,"This is an enjoyable book. Mr. Halberstam uses MJ as the centerpoint around which he portrays America today. Sports, media, race and labor relations are written about in an enlightening way. There are brilliant partial portraits of the people in MJ's life- Basketball Commissioner David Stern, Spike Lee and the people from Nike, Bull GM Jerry Krause, the coaching staff at North Carolina, Phil Jackson and many more. There are many 'I wish I was there moments,' like the pre-Barcelona Olympic tune up game in Monte Carlo-MJ's team versus Magic Johnson's team- perhaps the greatest basketball game ever. There's a scene before the 1998 playoffs where the Bulls have a team meeting where players just express how they feel about their time on the team. It's a wonderful book, as good as any of Halberstam's books and he's written many excellent books."
2,Flinx Fizzles,"In my opinion, Foster's biggest talent lies in creating intriguing alien flora and fauna. Unfortunately, unlike in its predecessor, Mid-Flinx, we have neither in Flinx's Folly. What we do have, however, are similar plotlines:1. A bad guy keeps trying to get rid of Flinx for a very shallow reason. In Mid-Flinx the villain wanted Flinx's minidrag, Pip, in Flinx's Folly the motive is jealousy.2. A group of bad guys keep trying to get rid of Flinx for political reasons.Both storylines and their outcomes are predictable and therefore boring. Despite those shortfalls, it could still have been an interesting book if the author had focussed on the budding relationship between Flinx and Clarity, but since that isn't Foster's forte, it fizzles as well."
3,Flinx is cool!,"Ok, I gave it only 3 stars! I wanted to give it more, after all this is a Flinx book. I do recommend it for all those who have been following the series for years, as have I. This book seems to give a hint at greater things to come, or that Alan is gitting tired. I hope the former is true, I for one am going to contenue to read whatever commonwelth book he produces.More...1) Another group of fanatics want him dead!2) He seeks out Clarity Held, after 6 years (good - remmeber longtunnel).3) Truzenzuzex and Tse-Mallory show up seeking his help (good)!4) They come to some conclusions that long time readers figured out a long time ago (ok).5) We are left hangging, waiting and hopping that more will be reveiled in the future!P.S. on scale of 1 to 10, I give it a 7."
5,Review where there was no review at all,"Testeagles are an awesome and unique band. This album has atleast 8 songs you can listen to over and over, mixing heavy guitar riffs with electronic sounds, but actually doing it right, where hundreds of bands have failed like a bitch. It's a pity they didn't continue after this record, they were simply brilliant."
5,Inspiring! Now I know what to do with my house!,"Other books I have read on Feng Shui were a bit dense or very much imbedded in Chinese culture, and not so appropriate for my life as a Westerner. This one is clear, poetic and concrete all at once, appropriate to the Western situation, and inspiring. It has questionaires to assess where in your life you need improvement, and how to use the feng shui chart to transform trouble areas in your home to bring about a change. There are many examples of ""before and after,"" to help you adjust your home. This is a whole new way of looking at Interior Design, and anyone interested in making some changes in their home would be interested in what this book has to say."
2,"Pretty Pictures, not enough beef","The pictures in the book are pretty, but the book read more like a western design book than a feng shui book. It discusses the most rudimentary elements of feng shui and I recommend it to people who are not really interested in learning about traditional feng shui. This book is designed for westerners who want a simplified, superficial look at the westernized notion of Feng Shui."
1,Do not buy this model!,"I build and take care of hundreds of computers for a University. I have a degree in Electrical Engineering. I have used many Coolmax@ power supplies. I placed an order for six model CX-400B Coolmax power supplies. Two failed within a couple months, three were DOA. Testing of the units show overvoltage, and lack of voltage control. Many motherboards were tried, the result was rebooting, failure to start and damage to one motherboard!! Warranty at Coolmax says they will replace them, but it shows someone at the company was asleep at the wheel during the production and inspection of this power supply. One star is one too many for this product!"
1,Terrible,"Can't hear it. Another waste of money. I'll buy American from now on. This was the first of two disappointments. Solti was the other, so I will make a point to buy American from now on."
5,Exceptional recipes,"Being a pastry chef, I have tried a lot of dessert recipes. I have to say, the recipes in this book are truly special. The lemon cream (in lemon tart) and Philadelphia cheese cake in particular are tremendous... The cheese cake, I omitted the topping and used fresh mangos instead of cherries, and still it was gorgeous - light as air, not too sweet, with just enough gelatin to hold everything in place. I do think the recipes require a fair amount of skills in pastry, but the book does a good job of explaining each step if you read carefully. If you try a recipe once and it goes wrong, I would recommend trying it again. Even chefs make mistakes all the time. I admit the first time I made lemon cream it didn't set because I neglected to use the immersion blender at the end. Well now I know better. I can't wait to make everything else in the book."
4,relief at last for a dessert fix!,"a former pastry chef on Martha's vinyard who would order dessert first before the entre, I raced to the kitchen to make the coconut loaf and the raspberry genoise. Was truly rewarded with delicous results, good tips for successful execution.by sally larhette"
2,Not impressed,"First of all, the deserts are not really the patisserie level desserts, dissapointed.Also less photos than expected.Second, why in the hell convert the initial metric ingredients to volume and not leave the initial metric? Does not Mrs. Dorie Greenspan think that since Pierre Herme is a European pastry chef some folks back in Europe might be interested in the book as well...And we just don't have the habit of using cups and spoons, we weigh our ingredients so do most professional chefs both in the old and new world.Overall, not impressed with the book and would return it if only I lived in the States."
4,not for the lazy or faint of heart....,"If you want to recreate some of Herme's decadent desserts at home, grab the ingredient list, READ THE ENTIRE RECIPE FIRST, then get started. They are all possible to recreate at home, but they do require some assumed culinary skills, and close, close attention to directions. If you are patient and willing to follow his directions to the letter you will get good results. This is NOT a cook book for someone who wants to throw something together at the last minute; even the easy ones require significant preparation. Most certainly worth a try....and the photos make it a nice book to thumb through for those who aren't doing the cooking."
2,somewhat disappointing,"One absolutely fabulous recipe here, which is the coconut loaf cake. The cookies are ho-hum.The Olive oil cake was terrible and the lemon cream, which is used in a tart as well as several other recipes is more like a lemon butter. Many of the other recipes are extremely time consuming to make so I can't say I've tried them. I think you'd be better off with Francois Payard's book."
2,A lovely presentation of ho-hum recipes,"Certainly this is a lovely book. However many of the recipes are nothing new (crepes, loaf cakes,pastry dough, genoise) or consist of adding an ubiquitous lemon cream to the crepes,pastry, etc. It does not compare in interest and clarity of exlanations with, for instance, Alice Medrich's ""Cocolat"". Overall, I was disappointed."
5,great investment,"I have read several books on FCP, from plain and simple for beginners to the real advanced stuff. This book I have to say, I have to place it on position number 1. To anyone serious about FCP is a must buy."
4,Earthdog afficianados,"The definitive information for beginning earthdog competitors and for those who have been in the sport for a while. Of course in my search for books on earthdog events, this is the only one I could find therefore making it the ultimate source. I did come across one that was listed briefly at a price of $99.99 but passed it up. This book does give you a lot of information to prepare the reader for participation in earthdog events with their dogs including a brief history, breeds to look for, training tips and rules of the sport. There is good use of photographs throughout the book to help support the information provided."
5,An entertaining and informative read,"Mario Migliorini has succeeded in raising his subject beond the level of a techniques and methods manual and instead has produced a highly entertaining and readable book. His easy open style and homespun anecdotes provide a facinating insite into the social origins of the ground dogs. A well researched and illustrated book, the section on hunting in the UK is a particular treat. Hard to put down, this book is worth a browse by anyone and is a must for Terrier enthusiasts."
1,"A fireside read, but it won't help you in the field.","While this book contains lots of history and general information there is very little for the enthusiast ready to start training their dog. The few chapters devoted to actually working your dog, contain little more information that the official rule book. I was looking for a resource to help me start training my dogs and setting up tunnels. I was very dissapointed. This book was not worth the cost, nor the (relativly small) amount of time it took to read it."
3,Good but a liitle fragile,The tire removal tool broke the first time I used it. The rest of the tools are metal but the tire tool is plastic
3,"""OK""","This multi tool is Ok, and does have some handy tools on it like the one socket that fits the brake adjustments. The wrenches though are horrible. They are all just a hair to small to fit the actually size they say. I can not take off my wheel with this tool as the biggest one is to small to fit over the standard wheel nut. You can't put any pressure on the wrenches or the metal clip holding them back will not hold and they will just fold. I also found that some of the hex wrenches were either to big or to small to fit some things on my bike. Tire levers are plastic and this thing is kindof bulky. Overall, its a nice package of tools if only the wrenches worked and I could take my tire off."
2,Okay for casual riding,"This kit is OK for casual riders. I put on around 100 miles a week bycycle commuting (not counding recreational riding), and for me the tire irons and tools didn't stand up. Having a tool break when you need to change a tire in the middle of your commute to work causes harsh words to be said.Spend a few $ and ounces more to get quality tire irons, patch kit and good quality multi-tool and you'll be miles ahead."
2,"Somewhat handy in the pocket or the bike bag, but the multitool is poorly built","This is a handy set, and it's nice to have all the tools I use most often on my bike in one place. The tire patch kit is decent, and I've definitely had use for it. Unfortunately, some of the most important tools just aren't very useful.The phillips screw head is pretty solid, but the flathead screwdriver narrows too much to be of much use for most screws. Additionally, the wrenches are supposed to lock in place but if you put any pressure on them they escape the lock and fold. That means if you have a tight nut, you really can't get it loose. I end up pulling out my ratchet kit every time for serious jobs. Still, this is handy to have on the road, and every once in a while comes in real handy."
2,Cumbersome to use and mediocre tool quality,While having multiple tools in a compact case is a great concept; it is limited to whether it can be used effectively. When I needed to adjust my derailleur it was difficult to maneuver the tool so the allen screw could be loosened and retightened while pulling the cable that was being adjusted. The metal appears to be poor quality and the plastic tire tools are a breakage risk.
1,NOT WORTH THE PRICE!!!!,This same thing is $15 at walmart. Not bad at that price. But at the $35 fulfilled by Amzon it isn't worth it. Buy the alien tool instead.Topeak Alien II 26-Function Bicycle Tool
5,great investment,"This product is a great investment, I really don't know how to fix my bike although I need to learn, but my boyfriend works on it for me (I'm lucky to have him) and these tools are great for him to be able to work on my bike and they are always handy so he can get to them quickly."
2,I Bought It over 2 Years Ago... Don't Waste Your Money!,"I'm disappointed with this so called bike tool kit. There really isn't much you can do with what is included in the Swiss army style kit. Out of everything there, I can use maybe 3 things for what my needs have been. Otherwise, I have to bring it to someone who has the right tools... I've come to the conclusion that 'Bell' products are overrated ... IMO"
3,Mostly desserts: disappointing,"The book is wonderful if you want mostly dessert recipes. I didn't.Of the 122 pages of recipes, only 49 were pages for items other than desserts, such as appetizers, side dishes and main dishes. However, what color photos there were, were excellent.All things considered, it's a good book for dessert lovers."
5,1 Quarrt Glass Lid Teakettle,"The kettle in the very hard to find 1 quart size is so well engineered that it takes up less room on the stove than the smaller size kettle it replaced. Also, the kettle makes an excellent cup of tea. Since many of my friends drink tea that is very important. Also the kettle is very good to look at and that is an asset since I always keep my kettle on my stove."
1,Worst Kettle Ever -- Surprizingly AWFUL!,"This kettle is tiny. It does not hold enough water to fill an 8 cup french press.But the worst problem is that it spills water everywhere! No matter how many ways I tried to pour from it (fast, slow, high, low and from every conceivable angle) it would spill at least 50 percent of the water.If the water in the kettle boils for even a few minutes, the plastic handle gets very hot and you need a pot holder to hold it.I am shocked that this is Faberware -- it is literally the worst kettle I have ever used.I recommend spending the extra money on the Bodum Ottoni."
3,GOOD PRODUCT,"Can't give it any high rating b/c product wasn't for my own use, but the person that requested it didn't give me any negative feed back so this product apparently met their needs."
4,Thank you,I am happy that the items were in stock and the price was great! I really like the brighter color: it stands out among a large stack of items for review.
5,"fast delivery, great book",I was very pleased with the fast delivery of this book. I've been looking all over for a good french horn manual and I finally found one! I highly recommend this book to anyone wishing to learn the french horn. It is very informational and interesting!
2,"If you have trouble sleeping, pick up this book.","My cousin gave me his copy in the 80's. I am glad to have it as a resource for repairs but that's about it. Then again, I now play for fun, having not been in a serious group since college. I'm sure it would benefit the professional player or college level music student. The style is very 50's esque and dryer than a desert. If you are a horn player and an insomniac, this is the book for you."
5,Still the best instructional book for all horn players,"A wealth of information. Techniques, warm-up scales, alternate fingerings, transposition, practice music to improve different areas such as range, intervals, pitch. Learned about this from a horn player in the Dallas Symphony when I was in high school, found it very useful when I played with the Guam Symphony, and used it regularly when I returned to playing after several years of absence. Given it to young players across the US and overseas."
2,huh,The instructions were not very clear and I couldn't find any better ones online. The cords are sort of flimsy and I am worried that they will get caught on something eventually.
1,"Don't Waste Your Money, Won't Last","Poor Quality. Returned for replacement, then had to return THAT one too! Zero stars would be more accurate."
1,Let nothing induce you to buy this product,"The only satisfaction I have gotten out of this product is this opportunity to vent. If the price seems too cheap, it is. Where to begin? Instructions, pretty bad. Hardware, missing, inconsistent, inadequate. Design, deeply flawed. Mounting, not on my standard mountain bike. Manufacture, cheap, cheap, cheap.What result culminated my frustrating evening retrofitting it just to see if it would work? I'll spare you the suspense, it didn't. Not a glimmer."
1,Piece Of Junk,"This was a complete waste of time and money. It never worked even for one minute, not even for a second.The brackets are flimsy and the instructions useless. After seeing it didn't work we hooked it to a volt meter and spun it with a hand drill. Voltage output was ZERO.I guess I should have returned it ASAP but instead I hooked the two lights up to a rechargeable 6 volt battery and try to keep my battery charged."
2,Leaves residue behind,"Smells wonderful, however it leaves residue that takes away from this product. Would not purchase again because of the huge residue this product leaves behind in tub"
2,Not really natural...,"Yes the soap smells nice, but to call itself natural...I don't think so. The ingredient list is all but natural. And petroleum...yes it coats the skin and gives the allusion of moisturizing, but it's not. I won't be buying this soap again."
1,Oatmeal and almond soap,"Hate it! opened it and threw it away. This smells like a very strong baby powder! Made me sneeze immediately upon opening it. I am very sensitive to certain smells. this bothered my nose as I said upon opening it. I bought it thinking I was buying a mild, natural product. How in the world they made oatmeal and almond smell like baby powder is just not right! Almond is supposed to smells like cherries. Oatmeal should have no smell at all! I have made my own oatmeal and almond soap and it was very mild smelled faintly like cherries. Waste of my money!"
4,Nice,"Works up a good lather. Smells different from other soaps, but I like that because I can have a special smell."
1,What a complete piece of crap,"Mine crashed about 15 seconds after I hooked it up to the computer. Panasonics' customer no service said ""tough toenails"" after I managed to get to a page on their website that actually went somewhere except back to the main page. I strongly advise looking elsewhere,unless you want a nice paper weight."
3,Barcelona map,"I appreciate the plastic coating on the map, but it was awkward in some ways to handle. However, it also did not tear or get folded the wrong way. Would be nice if it came with a marker pen that would write on it too!"
3,old,"This map is generally useful and the plastic format is very convenient, but although this site says the map is c. 2001, the map I got was a 1996 version, and therefore missing some significant developments since then, e.g., the Raval Rambla."
4,street map of Barcelona,"I bought this map for my son and his wife, as they are in Barcelona at this very moment on a vacation. They were very pleased with the map and I'm assuming it is helping them to get around very nicely, I will know more when they get back."
3,This map is missing detail,"In engineering we learn that when you optimize for one featureyou sometimes have to give up other features, or scale themback. Perhaps this is the issue with this map.The Streetwise map of Barcelona is designed so that it willeasily fit in your pocket or purse. It is plastic or plasticizedpaper, so it is sturdy. But what is lost is detail. For example,the street in the Ravel where I will be renting an apartment isnot shown on the map.The map does show the subway and bus routes which is nice too.But if you need detail, you need another map. I highlyrecommend the Rough Guide maps. They are detailed andvery tough. My survived daily use for two weeks."
4,cute shoes!,"These shoes are so cute and comfortable. I find the sizing seems accurate. I ordered the narcissus color thinking they were bone, but they are tad darker. I didn't give them 5 stars because they are slippery, but I put a grip pad on the bottoms and now they are fine."
3,Useful information but confusing presentation.,"Although this account of the famous explorer's life and adventures contained well documented and interesting information, I found the presentation rambling and often outright confusing. The first chapters were arranged according to specific expeditions, but the purpose of each expedition was poorly explained and it was easy to loose track of the individuals present and the chronology of events. Occasionally, events referred to in early chapters were not actually described until later chapters (i.e. the Court Martial of Fremont). Unfortunately the disjointed narrative distracted significantly from the informative content of the book."
2,A sympathetic but muddled biography,"This biography managed to make mundane and boring one of the most fascinating characters of the opening of the West. The fat-free, salt-free prose relentlessly rambles on with no distinction between events of monumental importance (Bear Flag Revolt, e.g. - one page) and tedious details of Carson's children. No explanatory detail is given about saddlery,horses,firearms,clothing,etc., nor is sufficient description given to the geography of the country in which he spent so much time. Most of all, the book suffers from a lack of detailed maps. On the bright side, the book seems well researched and documented and the sources are clearly indicated. Best of all, in this era of historical demonization, there is a genuine affection and sympathy for Kit Carson, quite convincing me that he was not only a fascinating pioneer but an exemplary character."
3,RIP-OFF,I have not actually seen this video but who would be stupid enough to sell a 60minutes vhs for $40.00??? It is maybe worth $10 or $15...........but $40???? Sheesh.
2,Not all it's cracked up to be,"If you are looking for a product that will make women fall to your feet with zero effort once applied on your part (ref: the old Axe commercials) then this is not for you. You will pretty much be paying $60 for some semi-pleasant smelling ""cologne"". Bottom line, women like confidence. So just go out there and talk to them and save yourself the money."
3,"Fast shipping, Will it give results?",The product arrived quickly but i was curious if my sisters would think it smelt good at all so I sprayed it on a piece of paper and let them smell it and they immediatly said it smelled terrible. I have not field tested it and may try combining it with my addidas colonge and see if that combats the smell so i can get results. Will write a review later describing my findings.
3,Not good enough,"I have tried like 10 different type of pheromone colognes and this one isn't good enough, its pheromone content in the bottle is too little, so does it effectiveness, but nice scent though."
1,You can buy this for half this price in your local store.,My business uses a lot of these sign stickers. When I saw the Amazon ad for 4 packages for $9.50 I ordered it. Turns out you get one package for $9.50. My local Office Depot and Office Max sell one package for $4.00. Watch the fine print and buy at a better price.
5,Tapco sidewinder,"I am a professional building contractor that has been using the sidewinder for 3 years now. Not only does it save time in cutoffs, it keeps my coil stock clean and dent free. I could not imagine ever going back to the old method of unrolling the coil on a bench or even the ground and scoring and bending to cut. A very worthwhile investment for any serious mechanic."
4,falling off the wagon,"I first read 'A Night' for a lit class in high school, and saved my copy, as it is one of the books that I re-read occasionally. It is such a wonderful, dense piece of satire, that it warrants a review occasionally to pick up or notice something new. With the turn of the century, I returned to the everlasting night of drinking again, and found that the Figeters, the Fabricators of useless objects, and the Clarificators are still among us, or us among them, as we soberly go through our world. As a good satire, the reader should see themself in the text, and I can't go through it without that happening (I'm a Clarificator). So, pick it up, read it, re-read it, and try to figure out if the author is an observer of patient in his allegorical world."
4,A Good Beethoven Fifth,"If you are looking for a solid but more more measured approach to Beethoven's 5th then this CD may be the one for you. The performance is ok, but in terms of what I look for most in this symphony: gripping, propulsive power, it lags significantly behind Reiner/Chicago on living stereo, Karajan/BPO '75 (or 63), or Carlos Kleiber/VPO. If you can tolerate decent mono sound then check out Furtwangler '43 on Tahra, or Klemperer '55 on EMI in great mono."
3,Moderately Happy,"The book ""Algebra 1"" is a decent textbook. It is a good refresher for those who need to brush up on their algebra skills. The beginning is nicely structured which seems to build the student up for the next lesson. The problem with the book is it does not include more challenging or important topics such as joint and direct variation, set notation, or conditional statements. It does not cover enough on matrices or statistics. It would benefit those who are middle school aged who are learning algebra, or those who want basic instruction with no advanced concepts. The book is organized well and it does allow for enough practice. I suggest, for those who want to learn more beyond the scope of the textbook, to purchase another textbook along with this."
3,It's Algebra,"What can you say, its algebra. Easy to follow examples per unit. Wish there were more lessons per unit. Good for beginning algebra students."
1,Algebra 1 or Calculators for the Stupid?,"This book pretends to be an Algebra 1 textbook, but is more of a calculator instruction manual. A child who completes a course based upon this book will be highly proficient in the use of his or her calculator, but will not have gained an iota of mathmatical skill or knowledge. If you are considering this book, I suggest you pull the instruction book from the box your calculator came in, it is just as useful and not near as heavy. On the upside, the book has lots of pretty colors."
5,It is so wonderful!,"Here is a recording of the Music Bible that is so very different for all others. It's not conventional but it is so not just to be different, to be eccentric. Mr. Kremer goes beyond the usual task of just creating beautiful sound on his violin to reach something far more important. Every movement, every dance is so much alive and refreshing that engages listeners to the music itself.You do need an open mind and an open ear to enjoy this. I do have many recordings, two of Szeryng, of Tetzlaff, early Milstein, Enescu, and Luca, of this monumental work, yet this recording will stand by itself as far as music and inspiration are concerned."
1,A disgrace to jazz.,"While there might be deserving artists on this CD, there is one song in partiicular that makes the entire CD a disgrace to jazz: ""Take 5"" by XL. Most jazz entusiasts have heard the original version of this song by The Dave Brubeck Quartet. It was particular creative because it used five beats per measure (hence the name ""Take Five"") of the song rather than the traditional four beats that almost every popular song uses.I was absolutely apalled when I first heard this cover on KKSF. XL had redone the song, but taken out its key element of having five beats and replacing it with the bleak four beats.Call it what you will but this is not a collection of songs from a smooth jazz station being that no station can bear the name ""jazz"" when they play a song that defiles jazz as much as XL's cover. Moreso, they play this song to an extent when I have never heard them play the original ""Take FIve""."
4,"Differently ""special"" but musical","jeg elsker denne cd, han udfordre den ellers meget firkantet maade mange dansker synger paa, og laver fantastiske sange ud af tekster om hverdagslivet...i love this cd, troels trier has affected the way that danish people sing. he writes amazing songs about everyday life...me encanta este cd, troels trier ha afectado como cantan la gente danes. escribe canciones increibles sobre la vida normal...ich liebe diese cd, troels trier hat die art wie daenische menschen singen beeinflusst. er schreibt grossartige lieder ueber das alltagsleben..."
4,Hot thumb!,Overall a perfectly fine tea kettle. However the placement of the lid opener means you can get a good dose of very hot steam on your thumb when you open it. Revere Ware similar teakettle has opener on handle. Much better!
2,tea kettle,"Sorry I bought this item. Farberware has always been a favorite of mine but this is not what I expected. Although the price was great, the spout is very awkward and does not close easily. It seems rather flimsy and I don't expect it to last over 20 years like my last Farberware tea kettle."
2,Toner,Loved this product but after a few weeks my skin became very dry. Not recommended for a sensitive skin . It also has a strong fragrance.
5,Great couch cover,"This product is exactly what I was looking for. I needed a plastic cover that would be unwelcoming to my cat who happens to like to pee on my couch. Since then, he has not even gone back to the couch again. I believe the smell of plastic scares him away, but even if he does pee on it, I will have no problems as I can quickly take the plastic off and clean it. Great product!!!"
2,plastic sofa cover,The sofa cover is like a paint plastic cover. It is made of thin plastic and with my dogs did not last a week without it being torn to shreads.
4,Pretty good,"These sofa covers are pretty good. We have two cats and I've noticed they don't like getting on the sofas now. They may jump around on them as they are playing around but get right off of them, so they don't lay around on them like before. I'm happy with this product."
1,Not at all as pictured,This product says it is a SOFA COVER however it isn't even in the SHAPE of a sofa. It is a piece of plastic in the shape of a rectangle. That's it. A piece of rectangular plastic that is 46W x 134L. That's it. One piece doesn't even cover the average sofa. What a disappointment. I'm just glad I ordered other items so that the shipping was free otherwise I would have been furious if I paid shipping charges besides paying the almost $4 for this item. I'm not sure why the manufacturer calls it a sofa cover. A rectangular piece of plastic does not a sofa cover make! Basically I will put it in the garage and use it someday when I need a paint cloth.
1,Not as great as it look,As a prior review has stated it is very thin plastic. You could get this at home depot or lowes in the paint department. It is not thick at all. Don't waste your money. Look for something better!! It is no match for a cat or dog.. or even kids for that matter.
1,Item not as good as description by seller.,"Item description was extremely misleading. I was expecting an actual slip cover that would stay in place and fit to the shape of my couch. Item turned out to be just a piece of plastic, that I could have purchased at any hardware store. Unfortunately, I was not able to open the package and attempt to use the "" so-called plastic slip cover"",until after the 14 day allowed return policy by the seller. I would never purchase an item from this company in the future."
4,Great for avoided pet hair,"These plastic covers are great! I place them over my sofas each day to avoid pet hair. I have two cats and they lay on top of my sofas while I am at work, yet my sofas remain clean and without pet hair. These covers are a great, low-budget solution to what used to be a problem."
2,Poor Design,"It seemed like a good idea, but this item was not designed well. I wish I had read the reviews before buying.It is very tight on the seat post. Definitely not quick and easy as advertised.My main issue with this item is the quick release bolt. It is in front of the seatpost right under the saddle. It is also quite large and my legs end up rubbing up against it. Lowering the rack as far as possible helps a bit, but it still in the way of my legs. For this reason and the poor reviews, I'm going to be returning it.On the pro side, it did feel very sturdy."
3,"price is right , slight mods required","not that bad , just pretend its a mud gaurd that can take a little weight. i had 20 lbs on it and it didnt bend . i did install a set screw thru the face of it into the seat post to keep it from turnin , and replaced the bungee cord with some real bungee cords."
3,Rack was low cost... Just ok..,"Sometimes you get what you pay for. The bike rack is just ok. Low cost, simple and easy to install. Can't handle a lot of weight. It works ok for the money. Not great."
3,Decent,"For the most part, I like my rack. However, I did have to buy my own bungy net to because the one it comes with is not only a little too small to hold a bag down, but it busted. With this product, you are getting what you pay for. It wouldn't hurt to spend the extra $10 for little bit better product."
3,Works ok but design tolerances are a problem,This works about as advertised but there is a tolerance problem. The hole that the seat post goes through is designed too small. First you have to figure out a way to pry this open a small amount. This isn't very easy since it isn't designed to bend much. Took a while to do this but then it seems to work reasonably well.
3,OK but has problems,"OK but....Two problems: 1) The rack is a bit too short to be really what it should be. It just works for me, but would be nicer if it were about 4"" longer.2) More importantly, the rack swivels from side to side, and there is no amount of tightening that I can do to stop it. I will have to resort to some kind of external hardware to fix it into place. That is a serious drawback.The Amazon service was good, as it usually is."
1,Doesn't fit my bike seat,"I would've guessed that in buying a Bell product they would have made it universally fit bikes - it doesn't. If the pole holding up your seat isn't the right circumference, this thing won't work. Lousy. It may work for your bike, but it's probably not worth the risk in buying it to find out. Find another product."
3,Beware of integrated bungee cord,"This rack works well, but on the first day of use the integrated bungee cord broke and the bag that I was carrying fell to the ground. I highly recommend using extra cord or a net. Is worth mentioning that the bag was probably 10 pounds (The product is advertised to hold 20).In the rear area this rack should have a red reflector for biking during the night. Since the one that usually comes with the bicycle gets blocked when mounting the rack to the seat post."
5,Better then I thought.,"I worried about how well this rack would work without support bars to the wheel, but it works just great and was very easy to install."
4,"Great book, vintage Cook","Another cracker of a thriller from Cook I was slightly confused by Yuri's motivation for his second-to-last act, but that's a minor complaint. Great ending too. But when are Jack and Laurie going to get together? I mean really get together? Mr. Cook, you've been teasing us for three straight books."
2,took me the first 300 pages to get hooked,"this story by cook is by far his worst i could not get into the story line for the first 3/4s of the book ""toxin""had me hooked after the first chapter by the time vector got interesting i had most of the outcome figured out also the charectors are getting boring jack, laurie &warren basketball ,bike riding and warren always to the rescue doesn't cut it anymore bill dean"
3,Quick listen on tape,"One advantage, among very few, to spending two hours a day driving to and from work is the time to listen to books on tape. I have the added good fortune to work a block from a large city library that carries a great selection of b-o-t. I don't know why, but I find many more 'bad' experiences with b-o-t than I do with the written word. Very few provide me with the sense of fulfillment that the hard or soft cover book does. Once in a while I listen to something that makes me wish I had invested more than a swipe of the free library card and had the chance to read the actual book. Six hours of abridgement didn't do justice to Vector. I would have liked to have seen more character and plot development - did the book provide this? I don't know. I felt the same sense of emptiness a previous poster did. What happened to everyone after the conclusion. Vector II, perhaps?"
2,Half way through and can't finish,"One of the worst books I have read in a very long time. It has been difficult to get even half way through the book. From the back cover it looked like a quick interesting book for a long plane ride, but talk about predictable. Definitely not a page turner if you have any forsight or intelligence at all. Also since I haven't read his other books I found all the past references to be terribly annoying in the way they were so clumsly added. In short you will see everything happening about a chapter or more before it actually occurs. One boring book. Try Rainbox Six if you want a good one on bioterrorism."
1,Left wing extremist political views ruined it for me.,"The book had great potential but the author ruined it for me by inserting his left wing extremist political views into the story. He tried to make the reader believe that all right wing conservatives are racists, what absolute bigotry. He villified legitimate gun dealers with the false assumption that a person can hold a valid Federal Firearms License after being convicted of a drug offense, what utter nonsense."
1,A busy doctor writes another great novel......NOT!,"This is simply terrible. If this book had been submitted to a publishing house or a college freshman English instructor, for that matter, under another name it would have been laughingly returned. The dialogue is just so amateurish.Of course with Robin Cook's name on it, it will probably be turned into a ""made for TV"" movie."
1,My Word,"The mystery in Cook's writing lies less in the fiction than in readers like me who keep buying ridiculous books like Vector. Although the spectre of biological terrorism provokes valid interest, Vector provokes little more than boredom. The ""terrorists"" in this far-fetched goon show are so inept that few readers could imagine them succeeding. The medical examiner protagonist is believable as a pathologist but almost malignantly benign as a human being. He frequently exclaims, ""My word!"" as he rides his bike through a stupendously one-dimensional existence toward the novel's stupifyingly predictable conclusion. In my opinion, this is a truly bad book."
2,Vector Hard Cover,"I have read all of Robin's books. I enjoyed every one of his books except Sphinx. It was very slow to get into and took almost till the end to enjoy the story. Vector was to predictable and very slow to get into. Robin were you having writers block with this book? It took me over a month to read. Usually one of his books, I can finish in a week or shorter. My all time favorite is Acceptable Risk. Please re-read it and write one that can continue with it. This book kept my interest and yet was scared to find out what would happen next. Write an Acceptable Risk II."
3,my review,"I enjoyed reading this book. Although the plot seems very predictable, it certainly teaches us the dangers of bioterrorism and how easily it can be made and dispersed.I like the way the author uses his characters, he makes them seem very real. And, if you are familiar with Cook's books, it certainly is a pleasure reading again about ""Jack"", his main 'hero'."
3,Not one of his best,I have read many of Cooks books and very much enjoyed most of them. Vector was too predictable throughout the book making the reading slow and long. I would not recommend it as a great read.
1,Too Politically Correct,"This book is kind of stifling. Cook is at his politically-correct worst here. All the blacks are saintly (even if they're violent), all the bad guys are white skinhead, nazi, right-wing extremists. Cook uses these derogatory adjectives so many times, it's nauseous. Plus, according to Cook, the skinheads have thousands of active members with a world-wide conspiracy. He maintains (as the AP also claims) Michigan is the headquarters of this KKK conspiracy. The plot of the book is pretty transparent. I mean, there's no suspense, you know who's going to win and 100% win. The bad guys are portrayed as stumble-bums lacking redeemable qualities.There are no shades of gray in this tedious text. Everything is 100% bad - white 'racists"" or 100% good - all blacks. Most people will admit there are good and bad examples in all groups of people, but Cook is such a fearful writer, he even portrays black gang members as deprived but moral."
2,Very disappointing,"When I select a Robin Cook book, I am not expecting great literature - just a good summer read. This book was pretty boring. The characters are very one dimensional and the technical detail gets very tedious at times. I agree with other reviewers who say that the dialogue is stilted. You never really get to know or like the main characters (the good guys)so what happens to them really doesn't matter. The bad guys are stale representations of stereotypical villains. All in all, a big disappointment."
4,One of the best books I have read from Robin Cook,"Vector is one of the greatest I have read from Robin Cook. Altough predictable with some chapters Robin writes the realities of bioterrorism. And with characters like Jack and Laurie, readers are in for some treat with the adventures they go through, much like the mayhem they encountered in Chromosome 6, another great book."
3,Well before its time...,"It was quite odd and fascinating to read this book after this actual scare happened after 9/11 -- and it was written in 1999. Talk about foresight! I wasn't too impressed with the ending, though. I thought Cook could've gone another route and made it really terrifying.I've yet to find a Cook novel that I didn't like. He is definitely one of my favorite authors. I can only hope to have a fraction of the successful writing career he's had over four decades.~Chad Clegg - Author: The DOMINO EFFECT"
4,Another haunting tale from the medical thrill master!,"One of the best characters I've read, Yuri Davidov (is that how you spell it?), is the centerplate of this book. He's disgruntled at the U.S.A.'s promise of prosperity, only to be turned down and lowered to cab driver. So, he decides to get back.With solid characters and page-turning suspense and action, Robin Cook has created yet another book to get your mind thinking. Despite the somewhat cliched and abrupt ending, Vector is a chilling book about what ends people will go to to get revenge, no matter who on."
3,my review,"This book is about a possible threat of anthrax poisonning by an unhappy immigrant.Sound far fetched? I'm not so sure.However, there are certain inconsistencies in the book that do not make it seem real-life, like having the lab in the basement and the neighbors not knowing. We all know how nosy neighbors can be....As for the characters, the author brings back a character he has used in previous novels. Jack, a doctor at the New York City Medical Examiner's Office. At least he keeps the suspense going between the search for the poison and the relationship between Jack and Laurie, a colleague.It is an interesting book and it will keep you reading."
2,He's done better,"Definately not one of Robin Cook's better books. The events were very predictable and the plot seemed to drag. Most of his books require more thought when reading them, not this one. The whole skinheads theme was also a turn off. He was dealing with too many issues (racism, gun control, imigrants, USSR vs. Russia now, biological warfare) and didn't tie them together very well."
3,Predictable and less than thrilling for Robin Cook,"After reading Chromosone 6 (audio version actually), I could not wait to read this one and bought the hardbound version. If you are a Robin Cook fan, save some money and wait for the paperback. I found the storyline predictable, the ""coincidences"" a little to unbelievable, and the characters somewhat boring. I am disappointed in this book."
5,You Just Can't Put It Down!,"Whenever you think Robin Cook just can't get any better . . . Vector comes along. Vector is a masterfully coordinated plot, quite possibly his best yet. We find ourselves back in Dr. Jack Stapleton's and Dr. Laurie Montgomery's daily lives (Blindsight, Contagion, Chromosome 6). They find themeselves facing tomorrows terror: Bioweapons. Just when you think Cook can't get any better than Toxin, he gets better. Cook never loses his touch.Don't wait for the paperback, grab this one right off the shelves! Vector is fantastic!"
1,"Hackneyed, reads like a script for a 'B' movie","This book has some of the most amateurish writing I've ever read. Cook is particularly weak in characterization, and has a clumsy, affected tone when attempting to write dialogue. I don't plan to read any of his future work."
2,Thin on plot and character,"Anthrax attacks on the US? Cook picked a good topic for a thriller, and he has plenty of medical knowledge.Unfortunately, that's about all that can be said for the book. The plot is weak and contrived, relying heavily on unlikely coincidences to point Jack Stapleton towards the terrorists. And he still doesn't figure it out - in the end, the villain explains it all to him, James Bond-style.The dialogue is worse, stilted and over-formal. When people talk to one another, their words sound as if they've been taken straight out of textbooks. Cook needs to sit down and listen to how ordinary people talk to one another.If you want to read about a terrorist anthrax attack, you _could_ buy this book - but it'd be cheaper to buy a newspaper instead."
3,"Well worth hearing on cassette, but not reading.","The story is good, but not as dramatic and action packed as it could be. If I had read it, more than likely I would have thrown it away about half way through! On a positive note, the beginning of the story gives meaning for the rest of the story. Which has an ammusing (almost ironic) twist of fate!"
3,He has done much better,robin cook's books always interest me and i look forward to reading them!! this one did not keep my interest as the others always have. the effort did not appear to be there. At times it was just a a disertation on biological warfare.
3,It was OK,"This book wasn't too bad. I was getting a little bored in the middle, and was trying to hurry through to get to the end. I'm glad I didn't give up on it, but not the most exciting book I've ever read."
3,NOT COOK'S BEST,"I was kind of disappointed in this book, but read it rather quickly. It kept my interest but wasn't as thrilling as Toxin, which was an excellent book. I hope his next book is better!"
2,"""Vector"" yourself elsewhere","To borrow a pilot's term, I wish I'd been ""vectored"" to a different book rather than Robin Cook's latest novel of the same name. It was overly predictable, the characters were one-dimensional and not worthy of the psychological analysis of their behavior. Cook spends far too much time on filler in the novel. I mean, who really cares about the rash on one character's face which resulted fom his pulling tape off his skin?? And on and on it went like that. The events were so coincidental that the reader begins to wonder if anything will come as a surprise in this book. I just finished his prior book, Toxin, which was fabulous. How can a writer run so hot and cold? Save your money or buy one of his earlier novels."
2,predictable,"I have read all of Robin Cook's books. However off late each one is becoming more and more predictable. There is hardly anything to hold as suspense. Completing the book was just going through the motions. I would still prefer the God Player, Harmful Intent types."
5,You Just Can't Put It Down!,"Whenever you think Robin Cook just can't get any better . . . Vector comes along. Vector is a masterfully coordinated plot, quite possibly his best yet. We find ourselves back in Dr. Jack Stapleton's and Dr. Laurie Montgomery's daily lives (Blindsight, Contagion, Chromosome 6). They find themeselves facing tomorrows terror: Bioweapons. Just when you think Cook can't get any better than Toxin, he gets better. Cook never losed his touch.Don't wait for the paperback, grab this one right off the shelves! Vector is fantastic!"
1,"Unbelievable, and Not in a Good Sense","I never heard of this Cook character previously, but I heard there was a bioreactor in this novel, so I decided to check it out. I'm sorry I did. This book was totally unbelievable, not to mention poorly edited, if at all. If it weren't for what seemed to be dozens of so-called coincidences, the dots would never have been connected.The only memorable part of the book was when Jack flipped Curt the middle finger during his 'sanctioning' in the middle of rush hour traffic.What ever became of Paul Sutherland? Was he really the secret leader of the PAA?"
3,Vector,"Love Robin Cook. ""Vector"" had your attention but not an actual disaster. I was looking for how they would handle that the whole way through the book. It never happened. I like the ending though good enough, those two got what they deserved."
1,Ugh...only if it's the last book on earth,"In the first place, it's OBVIOUS Cook doesn't live in NewYork. The names he drops! Believe me, those people did NOT have dinnerat Elio's. Also...it's as if Cook lifted pages and pages from his previous books about these less-than-scintillating characters. You'll encounter such commercials for his past works: ""As happened in blah blah, Dr. Laurie Montgomery did blah blah blah."" And it couldn't be written in a more blah manner. Not a single character is remotely believable. And didn't Cook know that music has a lot to do with violence, white supremacy et al? Where has he been living? He also lifted BORING research...or his underpaid researcher lifted it, then he cut and pasted it into the manuscript. What has happened to this man? Robots R Us. Do not bother, even for a no-brainer beach book. END"
1,Brain Dead,"Cook and his editors must be in a Coma. Not even the plot was original material, and the execution was extremely shallow and sloppy.Let's see, a medical examiner tracks down a madman bent on unleashing a bioweapon on New York City. The bioweapon was cooked up in a basement lab...If I were Richard Preston, author of Cobra Event, I would sue for copyright infringment. I'm glad I only read this one from the library, because I would not have wanted to pay good money for this bad book."
3,"Well, it wasn't too bad","I thought the book was entertaining for being fiction. The storyline about the biological warfare was somewhat believable. I thought that Jack was a very well developed character, however, would have been fired long ago because of his escapades. This is a good vacation book."
4,I loved it!,"After reading some of the reviews on this board, I was kind of scared to start this book. But since I'd paid for it, I knew I'd have to start sooner or later, so I decided on sooner. I loved the book. I enjoyed the characters, the different places in the city that they visited, the touch of romance, and the fast action. Now granted I haven't ready many of Robin Cook's books so if the plot in this book is very similar to those in his other works, I wouldn't know. But for me, this was one of the better books I've listened to lately. And in fact, I've already recommended it to a friend."
4,Like a sequel to Chromosome 6,"I found the book to be very enjoyable but, maybe I have read too many Robin Cook novels, because I found it very predictable. If you have read Chromosome 6, you will be able to guess who will end up saving Jack. This book just did not surprise me like the others had, but still very much worth reading."
4,"Enthralling, but follows the same lines as his past book","Vector was a great book and keep me turning the pages late into the night. However, if you have read his past books then you are familar with the patterns that all his books follow. This book is no different. Vector is informative and frieghtening, but predictable. I enjoyed it and will read it again."
4,Most parts were good,"Most of the parts of this book were good. The parts about the foreign guy and his wife were a little hard to get through, but the parts with Jack and Laurie were, as always, enjoyable to read."
1,I couldn't even finish this,"I suppose I should have actually finished the book to review it, but hey, I know what is going to happen!This is just ridiculous. I started reading Robin Cook in the late 70's, and loved his books. The last few years though....it is like he is just trying to crank out anything, the more outlandish the better.There were too many coincidences. In a city of how many million? And it goes on and on.I hope Dr. Cook gets back to writing the way he used to. Dr. Kay Scarpetta does not need competition from Dr. Jack Stapleton!"
4,important food for thought in today's world of terrorists,"This is an average Robin Cook novel, which is to say a somewhat contrived and predictable plot line, but also that Dr. Cook says important things within the context of his boox. He tries to keep it interesting, which he succeeds at here as in the others, while reminding the reader of real conditions and threats in the world. He did this with contaminated meats in ""Toxin"" and does it again with the terrorist threat of biological warfare here in ""Vector."" I read his novels every year and am never disappointed in the lessons i come away with. Food for thought."
4,It kept me interested!,"I have read most of Robin Cook's work and this one was not a disappointment. His charecters are true to life. The plot had me hooked.( I even investigated ""skinheads on the internet"")I always look forward to any new book he writes!"
2,Not Worth the Money,This was certainly not what I thought it would be! Only 35 minutes long and LOT'S of the animal clips missing. Feels like a rip off.
1,You couldn't even call this Cocoa 101,"I was really hoping this would be an in-depth and insightful book on the AppKit framework and Objective-C in general.It doesn't go much further than ""Learning Cocoa"" and the examples are so simplistic; reading the documentation would give you the same results.Oh well......I guess we'll just have to wait for someone else to come out with something geared more towards professionals."
5,The most illuminating book on Cocoa,"I already understood object-oriented programming and was eager to learn about Cocoa. I read this book and the O'Reilly books. ""Cocoa Programming for Mac OS X"" was clearly the best. Judging from the Cocoa mailing lists, everyone seems to agree that this is the best place to start with Cocoa programming.I was worried that it might not be ready for Mac OS 10.2. A few of the screenshot are clearly dated, but overall the book is completely 10.2-compatible. Also, there was extra information at the Big Nerd Ranch website to ensure that I had no problems using the book with Mac OS 10.2.I like the clear, readable style, and I thought the material covered was truly useful. I actually emailed the author, and I found him quite pleasant and helpful. I hope he writes an advanced book."
4,2nd Edition due out in April 2004 (ignore rating),"I was sooo close to buying this book, and then found out a new edition is due out this month. Looks like I'll need to wait a week or two to get my copy. My guess is that, in addition to other changes, the book will use Xcode instead of Project Builder in the examples."
4,Excellent introductory tutorial,"I've never had the privilege of attending Aaron's highly-regarded 'Big Nerd Ranch' training program, but I have to believe that working through this book is the next best thing. The book is presented in tutorial form, with a nice flow between examples, discussion and exercises.The author doesn't hesitate to share his opinions, good or bad--particularly on subjects like Cocoa Java. The result is a frank, incisive introduction to Cocoa programming that helps beginners understand 'the right way' to do things, and will make Apple's object-oriented environment accessible to people with a wide variety of skill levels."
2,A Touch of Frustration,"In trying to use Interface Builder (as it came with MacOS 10.0) to follow-through some of the book's early examples, the Interface Builder did not behave the way the book describes. I abandoned the project created by my first attempt and started a second one - being very careful to do exactly as the book says. IB's responses still were not as the book describes. Made me wonder whether the book was describing a beta version of IB. I found the O'Reilly book ""Learning Cocoa"" more accurate in this respect.Must give it another try, one of these days. I'll update this review if I figure out what I must have missed the first two times around the block."
5,Cocoa Programmming by Aaron Hillegas,"This is the first Cocoa book I have found that comfortably leads the reader from Objective-C and Cocoa concepts to lots of understandable working code.The examples illustrate the power of Interface Builder but the interfaces are, refreshingly, only complex enough to illustrate concepts. Much of the book covers the essential Cocoa concepts that make the interfaces run and the tight integration of the code with IB.The documentation required to create the examples is all within the book. References to Apple documentation are there to lead the reader beyond the content of the book.The writing is not only understandable but very efficient. As a result even more material is covered than might be expected from the healthy 432 pages.Don't start underlining! Every word is important."
3,a childhood favourite,"i saw this movie at a very young age and it left a tremendous impression. As an adult, of course, its not as spectacular...but i'll never forget a certain climatic scene. Although a little out-dated now, it still holds its weight with message."
4,Family Show,"Good for teaching kids to love animals,Fully enjoyed when I watch it and it was recommended to me, I wont over rate it but its something to keep in mind next time you wan't to watch something different and interesting if you don't wan't your kids to be little nasties."
2,So So Coffee,"I bought this because the store was out of my brand. I was disappointed with this coffee. Not very flavorful, and the flavor is just ok. Wouldn't buy again."
3,tastes pretty mediocre to me,"I've brewed this coffee a few times after buying a bag, and unfortunately it joins the many other decaf coffees that just don't have the full flavor of regular coffee. I'm giving it away and will keep on looking.If anyone has tried a few decafs and found one that tastes great (brewed like most in a drip coffee maker), please let us know!"
2,Not for the best for small scale cheese making,"I borrowed this book from the library and I was glad I didn'tbuy it.It focusses on the process for making hard, pressed cheeses.I much prefer Ricki Carrols book for acccessible information pertinant to someone making small quantities of lots of different varieties of cheese."
4,The man knew he had talent.,"A bit self-indulgent, Bellows had an illustrious career, he knew it, and he tells you that. Close your eyes to the braggadocio and you still have an interesting account of a very talented man who rode some horrific transitions in his profession, the newspaper industry. The man was known for his spark and innovation. Sadly enough, as the title states the fact, Bellows was brought into save a lot of sinking ships. Makes you wonder what he could have done if born a little earlier and paired up with a thriving paper. Ah, but I'm sure Bellows had the same ruminations. The book is a fast read and entertaining."
2,Legend in his own mind,Jim Bellows certainly is a journalistic legend--at least in his own mind. His book reflects an enormous ego for someone who presided over the deaths of three major newspapers. But his book is just gosspiy enough to make a fun read for journalists and former journalists. I can't imagine anyone else being very interested.
1,ONE BIG EGO TRIP,"When I cracked this book open I was expecting a Ben Bradlee type of book, but instead of a bio I got page after page of how great the author is. The ""Last"" Editor is not the ""first"" book where the author blows his own horn at the expense of others or the companies he worked for, but it is the first that I have read that makes me wonder why it was published. Adter all, the readers like me want something more solid than just a PR campaign and an ego trip in print. Besides, most people never even heard of the author as the 30 or so year old picture on the cover clearly notes."
1,Bollettieri's Tennis Handbook,"For any tennis players who want to learn any stroke, DO NOT buy this book. It is a total waste of money for me. Like the previous reviwer said there is no picture for the stroke production section at all. I BOUGHT his videos which are sketchy in many parts. I bought this book to clarify things on the tapes. I tell you there is nothing in this book that can help me understanding the videos better.I want to make it clear: his videos are not best made but have some good points in some tapes (Killer Forehand for one but I hate the distastful humor in it). So stay away from this book, it is a total waste of money."
2,A beginner's view,"While I do not question Nick's ability to teach the game of tennis, this book was not written for beginners. In fact, it is hard to tell who it is written for since he never makes it clear. From what I can tell, the book seems to be aimed at the average coach or instructor who is looking to improve his or her teaching methods to juniors. It seems the book was written under the assumption that you already have an extremely strong foundation of the concepts and mechanics of the game, but again, it's hard to tell. I also believe the author spent way too many pages as promotional material for his prestigious tennis academy. Perhaps in five years when I have a much better understanding of the game, I will come back to Nick's book and look to improve my game."
2,What McEnroe thiks about Bollitierri,John McEnroe wrote a review for one of Bollotierri's books. McEnroe said that Nick didn't know anything about tennis....Nick printed it.
2,"Rough, cheap fabrication. Sharp edges.",The product works well but who knows for how long. Very cheap stamped construction. The bottom of the venturi tube looks like it was cut out with a pair of tin snips by a child and presents an injury hazard due to sharp edges while handling. The adjustable length of the venturi is unusual and was very handy for me in a special application.
3,size matters,I order these by the picture not the size.They are not the ones I wanted.But after using because it was my mistake in ordering I love them and will order again
3,eh ?,"I ordered these thinking they were the standard size post-its. Didn't really pay attention to the dimensions - Just saw the ""Original""and assumed they were the original size. Maybe the description should read ""Mini"" or something ??? So, I give it a moderate rating for poor product description."
2,postit,"I didn't realize how small these were! I guess that is my fault, but had I realized the size I wouldn't have paid that much"
1,Be careful - pads don't all have the same number of sheets,"You would think a pad of Post-its would be the same, whether you got it in a pack of 6, 12, or 24, right? Wrong! The pads in the 6-pack are only 300 sheets, significantly smaller than what I think of as a normal pad, which is probably more like 500 or 600 sheets. The price per pad for the 6-pack was much better than for the 12-pack or 24-pack, now I know why."
4,post it notes,Post it notes were not available locally. I use them frequently. I was glad to be able to acquire them online.
3,Roots of the Russian Language,"It's a good book if you know a little russian, but want to improve your knowledge of the language more."
5,met my expectations,"Arrived in a timely fashion, works well, all in all met my expectations. Form fit and function. Quality product. good"
2,Should be an EP,"Download the title song, and maybe the other two, Lullaby and Wake Up, but the rest is not worth the purchase price. Wang Chung was at their peak when they did this, and the Title song is one of the best they did, but the rest is just filler, The first 4 cuts are vocals, Wait was on their previous album and also in this movie. The other three of the first four are fine. The remainder is instumental, and I will have to take a second listen to the rest, because, as I said, this was their best period musically."
4,cd review,"good ol' tunes from Wang Chung,good as the flick and well sung;Wm. P. was good in the show,partner was/is always so-so;tks Amazon, ""feat gea kung."""
1,Worst ST ever made,"I don't know HOW anyone could honestly say that this soundtrack is ""good"" or ""fits the movie"", let alone sit home and listen to it purely for music's sake. It's some of the cheesiest, most forgettable 80's music ever made. I think it might have a value for torturing Al Qaeda prisoners to try and get them to talk, but beyond that, I am completely blown away that this ST even made it on to a CD.To each his own, but I wouldn't take a free CD of this Soundtrack if it was the last copy on earth."
4,Soundtrack for one of the truly great films,"I still get chills when I hear To Live and Die in L.A., the first track, it is the opening scene of the film.I gave it 4 stars rather than 5 because taken as a whole it is not a truly perfect album. It is definitely worth owning because there are some KILLER cuts. If you have seen the film it is a MUST OWN. If you haven't seen the film I believe it is still very much worth buying because the title track may be the best song that Wang Chung ever did.To Live and Die in L.A. is one of the best films of the last 30 years. If you love action, if you love gritty realism, if you admire the work of talented people then you will want to see the film and own the soundtrack.I can't really praise this film enough and the soundtrack brings it all back each time I listen."
4,"If you liked the movie, this CD is worth the low price ($6).","This CD doesn't contain any songs from the movie that were *not* performed by Wang Chung, nor does it contain any popular or known songs by Wang Chung. Nevertheless, it does contain the rest of the soundtrack. Mostly instrumental, the music is standard eighties fare, which is to say between disco and New Age. The main reason I bought it was for the instrumental _City of the Angels_ and for that, it was worth $6."
4,Good soundtrack even if not a Wang Chung fan,"I am not a big WC fan to say the least, but this is an outstanding piece of work. If WC had taken this route instead of their radio pop fare they would be a much more respected band,"
3,DVD-R,"Not a review - just a notice that this is a DVD-R not a real DVD. Unfortunately my copy was damaged in transit - but the purple color gave away the format (DVD-R) - $20.00 for a burned DVD is ridiculous!1 - Dwyck2 - Take It Personal3 - Just To Get A Rep4 - Ex Girl To The Next Girl5 - Step In The Arena6 - You Know My Steez7 - Full Clip8 - Mass Appeal9 - Discipline10 - Royalty11 - Rite Where U Stand12 - Nice Girl, Wrong Place13 - Skills14 - Same Team No Games"
2,"Poor video quality, poor audio quality, DVD-R","I basically ordered this so I could get only a few videos that I didn't already have. Unfortunately, the video quality is horrible (some of these are taken from PAL masters, blended and converted to NTSC), audio quality is horrible (they didn't bother to replace the audio with CD audio), and, here's the kicker: IT CAME AS A BURNED DVD-R! Packaging was garbage (the label was printed by a home inkjet printer). This is not worth $5, let alone $20."
4,A realistic view into the life of a CEO.,Forget the celebrity hype often associated with being a CEO that is presented in most business magazines. The CEO Chronicles allows a look at CEOs that shows them as they are: real people dealing with real issues. This book acurately portrays the struggles and the triumphs associated with owning and running a business. This book is a great way for business owners and CEOs to see they are not alone and for their employees to better understand the complexities associated with life at the top.Jim Canfield
2,Green screen,"This worked well for about a week. My older unit was glitchy, causing the screen to distort and lose the signal. Initially, this unit was far better, until it began to imbue everything with a greenish hue that comes and goes as it pleases. With our system at church, this has NEVER happened before, so I have to place the blame on this unit. I'm outside the window to return it, so I""ll have to buy a new, different brand."
1,((( GREAT UNIT! DID EXACTLY WHAT I WANTED IT TO DO!! ))),"IT WORKED!!!!! Until about 5 days after I could not send it back then it stopped working! Man, am I ever angry about this!!! It would have been better if it never worked at all!!!! Going to try lowering the resolution on the computer. I hope that helps"
4,Good resource for the Sci-Fi collector,"This is an excellent book for anyone interested in collecting sci-fi books. The author does a good job of summarizing the history of science fiction, notable titles, publishers, authors, and illustrators. If you're new to book collecting, the book tells you how to start a collection, how to grade a book's condition, or determine if a book is ""collectible."" The author focuses mostly on collecting paperback editions. While the book does give a few prices on some select books, this is not a ""pricing guide"" (a book that lists titles and gives their prices). My only negative comment is that the book is a little pricey given it's size."
3,Not a pack of mixed colors,These were all blue. I had picked them bc the picture showed a pastel assortment. This was for an 8 yo girl and blue didn't exactly thrill her.
2,Not a variety of colors,"I chose this particular version of the product because of the colors. The picture shows many different colors, in pastel shades. The picks we received were all one, ugly grayish green color. Maybe pick color isn't a big deal, but I took the time to specifically chose these colors because I knew my daughter, who's learning guitar, would like them. So, don't trust the picture & know you will probably get some yucky generic color if you order these."
5,Great book!,"What a neat little book! I enjoyed reading this novel and so did my nine year-old son! It was an awesome story about showing the love of Christ even in the most difficult of circumstances. Good books like this, Sarah Maxwell's series about the Moodys, and my book The Orphans of Mordecai's Castle: The Haven are safe and appropriate to place in the hands of our children."
3,For VB users & beginners only,"I was unimpressed by this book. MSDN documentation was 10x better, they failed to include any reference to Remote Scripting or Callback methods, they didn't add in any reference of how to use client side script handlers or a number of features you would expect that are included in 2.0. If you want an update to all the past controls that you already know then this is great, if you want to delve deeply into the advanced new features of ASP.NET 2.0 then I don't recommend this. The author also is obviously a VB developer but pads the book by using a generic converter for most of his code, quite a poor display in my opinion."
4,"Comprehensive, terse, guide to 2.0","This is a very well written guide to the new features in ASP.NET 2.0. The new controls are covered in depth, as are portals and personalization. Themes and skins are given their own chapter. The book is code and screenshot heavy. Exposition is kept to the bare minimum and sometimes less. The material is also terse and advanced enough to only be suitable for those who are familiar with ASP.NET 1.0."
5,I loved it!,The sound is beautful and just the thing to listen to after a hard day at work! I love the high energy and earthy sound. The women's voices are very stong and sensual. I would add this one to my collection of world music and sounds.
4,Benjamin McFadden and the Robot Babysitter,Mrs. Burton's class read this fantasy book about a boy who disobeys his mother and father and it leads to a big disaster. Benjomin is left alone with his robot babysitter and all he wants to do is have fun. When Benjamin disobeyed his parents and reprogrammed his robot babysitter he got more than he expected. This book is an excellent story for young children and adults. To find out more about his adventure buy this book.
5,The Immigrants Daughter,"I was surprised that I really enjoyed this book , normally I like historical books but this was an interesting story, I felt like i was there."
5,The Immigrants' Daughter: An American Experience,"I received this book as a gift and loved it. Myself an immigrant's daughter, it gave me insight into my own experience as an American child with bi-cultural expectations and unique perspectives. Many of us, like Terzian, were raised by parents or have grandparents who came to this country wanting an escape from harship, but, while enjoying a better life, were uncomfortable with the differences and afraid of losing the hearts and minds of their children. Terzian captures this paradox and much more."
4,The Commish on Kindle,"So far, the quality of the Commish videos were the only ones lacking. In at least three episodes I have watched so far, the video did not match the audio."
5,Root Booster is great!!,My hairstylist used this on me for the first time and I loved it! It helps give your hair a lift right at the roots to help prevent from going soooo flat later.
4,BOUNCE & BODY,HAIR LOOKS AND FEELS MORE THICKER. I JUST SPRAY AT ROOTS ON TOP AND SIDES AND STYLE. LOVE THE FULLNESS.
2,yuck,"it didn't lift or gave body to my hair, it just made the roots more moist and oily greasy, and i do have a lot of fine flat hair. i thought i could activate the spray buy blow drying, it just made it more greasier then before. i wouldn't purchase this again. oh don't get me wrong, i love the smell."
3,Disappointing,"I am a fan of Gorme and Lawrence, and I liked the album, but for the money, it definitely was not worth it. I felt taken."
4,An essential reference for all spatial data scientists,"This book (known simply as ""The Schowengerdt Text"" in our lab) is one of the most necessary books for anyone interested in advanced remote sensing or photogrammetric analysis. Though peppered with equations, the majority of the text is written clearly. What this tome has that others severly skimp on, is the abundance of diagrams and actual image/data examples from selected sensors. The advanced chapters covering spatial transforms, spectral transforms, and sensor models were particularly good. This was a 5-star book when released, but today it grades out at a solid ""4."" Saying that, a new edition with updated sensors (and summaries of the caveats/benefits/uses of each) and more color plates would be greatly welcome. If your going to nit-pick about anything with this book, the index could have been a little more comprehensive."
3,"The Nickel Plate and Akron Canton, Youngstown","The tape was good in covering the Nickel Plate but was lacking on the coverage of the Akron, Canton and Youngstown Railroad. It had actual footage of the ACY but showed very little of it, instead showed and excursion trip with a locomotive from another railroad. The title was misleading with that in mind."
3,A little thin,Some of the plot was a little thin and cliche. The original book was much better but it is still a fairly good read.
4,good reading by accident,I found this book while randomly browsing the stacks in my local library. Got caught up in the excellent adventure and great writing as soon as I opened it. The only thing lacking is a good map or two on which to trace Issac Strain's travels.
5,4th book's as great as the 1st 3 by any name!,"Morgan Avery (AKA Shirley Kennett) strikes again! Her characters are so real you feel like you really know them. Be sure to read her 1st 3 books to top this one off! Keep writing, Shirley, no matter what name you have to use! Your fans will always follow your books!"
3,Home Key Ideas in Geography,"I have lived in many countries and thought this particular book would be insightful as to how a Third Culture Kid would react to ""home"". I found that it really didn't answer any of my questions as to what goes into feeling ""at home"", and the actual structures. It may be helpful to others, but it wasn't to me. The kindle edition does not do well in this style of book with inserts of discussions interspersed with the text. It was hard to differentiate the two and made reading it a bother."
1,Don't waste your money,"I purchased these Malibu lights a few months ago. They don't work well. First of all, some of them come on before it's dark during what I'd call a very light twilight. Secondly, if you live in an area that is cloudy a lot like I do, the lights only seem to gather enough charge to be on for maybe 2 hours. So, combined with the first problem, it means the lights are on during twilight and not on when it is actually dark. Don't waste your money."
2,Disappointing!,"Very disappointing! The concept is great - use the Sun and power up at night. The fact is, the lights don't work well. Those that do power up are dull and don't really light up the driveway. There was one of the lot that didn't work at all. I am returning them. I guess, you need to find a lamp that can really suck up energy from the Sun and store it so that it can feed the lights for over many days. Else, in those dark wintry days, you come back home only to see your driveway not lit up."
1,Beware of spirits presenting themselves as angels,Spirits present themselves as angelic presences and can use this power to wreak havoc in your life.
4,"Does not include the song I bought it for, but great.","Here is the song list (since it is not up on Amazon as of this posting):1 Lock And Key2 Photograph3 Hello, Never4 Death Could Be At The Door5 It Was A Lovely Parade6 Holy7 Your Beauty Is A Knife I Turn On My Throat8 It's So Sexy9 Last Song10 Heal It/Feel It11 Ballet Or ArtThe song I bought it for was ""I'm Sorry, But I'm Beginning To Hate Your Face"", and it is NOT on this CD.If you like Spoon, Flight of the Conchords and David Bowie, you will really enjoy this album."
5,If I didn't know better....,"I'd say that Jason Isaacs sounds just like Robert DeNiro in gangster mode.It was cool! Condidering Isaacs is from Liverpool, he pulled it off nicely.It's also a great show!!! I can't wait for season2 ."
2,The Brotherhood - First season,"I thought this mini series was poorly written and poorly acted. The screenplay was not very good and the accents used by the characters to ""resemble"" Rhode Islanders were totally unrealistic and insulting. As a Rhode Islander, the only things I liked in this mini series were the location shots of Providence. I was able to recognize all of them. I was an extra in the series and did see myself several times which was fun to see."
1,Very Crude,Only got through a few minutes. The language and content were unnecessarily crude and vulgar. Definitely could not recommend it.
5,Excellent first season,"This is an excellent first season of a show that is reminiscent of The Sopranos and The Wire.The series deals primarily with the relationship of the two brothers - one who is a budding politician while the other is a gangster. We get to see the family grow and a number of storylines develop involving drug addiction, political backstabbing, family conflicts etc.More than worth your time in watching it. Annabeth Gish's character is a highlight of the show and I am looking forward to seeing Season 2."
4,"Family, but not an""other"" family","I bought this set not knowing much about it, other than someone had compared it to Sopranos. It is absolutely nothing like Sopranos... although one or two actors appear in both shows. Is it good? Yes. Is it as good as Sopranos? No... not yet. The first season was a bit slow to start, but definitely improved greatly by the end. I've just started watching the second season and I'm really enjoying it."
3,Soprano wanna- be,"This is a lighter version of the Soprano's. The plot is not very original and the Irish-Catholic-mobster thing wear thin very quickly. You have the usual bad seed mobster son, the slightly better seed corrupt politician son, the drug dependent wife having an affair with a blue collar lover because she's bored and suffering low self esteem, and the Irish mom who manipulates anyone she can. Pretty blah stuff after 2-3 episodes. It does have some humor (check out the guy with eh fake ear)."
5,The Brotherhood DVD 1 session,I purchased the Brotherhood DVD 1 session for my husband for christmas. The product came when purchased and in great condition. My husband loves the show!
5,Love it!,"Jason Isaacs is the perfect gangster. He kills only the bad guys, not the good guys. If you liked Scarface, or those other mobster mobies, this is one to add to your collection. The Caffee's are brothers who shouldn't be."
2,Not as advertised....,"Although as described by Amazon and even on the DVD, it does not have subtitles. Often background noise and music obscure dialog, and occasionally actors mumbling muffles the dialog. I found this very distracting from what otherwise seemed to be an excellent film"
3,Review of Astrom and Wittenmark,"Astrom Wittenmark's book on Computer Control Systems is a good book for intermediate and experienced people in the field of Computer Control Systems. It is excellent in its contents and coverage of the field as a whole.What it needs is some details at certain places so that things will be easy to comprehend. What I mean is that its not the best book to have as a first text towards the subject. We used the book as a course text for advanced controls class. With little control background, I felt it very tough to read the book. But now that I am well versed with the field, I find this book handy to keep."
4,AHHHHH,"This is so useful not only for myself, but has been most helpful for clients in therapy. Can be listened to on breaks during the day or for concentrated relaxation and deep meditative states. A great unwind after a busy or stressful day. Highly recommended!"
2,Healing CD,Boring after about the third listen. Played it every night for two weeks at bed time. Finally couldn't listen to it anymore.
2,Quel dommage!,"For a huge Les Miserables fan and a francophile, this CD was a bitter disappointment.The voices of the characters are flat and without passion; the singers seem to be reciting the words, without any idea as to who they are and why they are there. The best character in the entire show, Javert, is not developed and is confined to a tiny part. Adult Cosette is intolerable. Enjolras attempts to save the overall quality of the CD, but he is not enough for me not to regret buying it.The only upside of the CD is to hear the lyrics in its original form, but the singers are frankly not doing the justice to the words. I hate to say that, but the English version is much better."
4,"No Jondrettes, but we have Gillenormand here","I absolutly love this recording. I have resently fallen in love with French Musicals and this is one of the two that started me (The other being Notre Dame de Paris). Anyone who has read the book as I have will see the details left out of the English verion. For instance, the charactor of M. Gillenormand, Marius' Bougeosis (SP?) grandfather is left out of the English version, but is given a song in the Original version. This however is in no way a complete parallel to the novel. The Thenardiers as the Jondrettes and Marius' cruelty towards Valjean at the end are left out, as are other parts. About the only singing I do not like is that of Thenardier, he has very little character voice and sounds to pretty. Also, the prologue is not in this recording, instead no background is given and the show starts with Journee est finie, the original At the End of the Day.Over all I would recommend this album to anyother Les Mis freak."
4,Everything Sounds More Beautiful in French,"This is what fans of Les Miserables will be excited to listen to... it's the concept album that Cameron Mackintosch heard that inspired him to produce the history-breaking show and the show that was recieving standing ovations in France.This a C.D. for the die hard core fans of Les Miserables and despite it's all in French it's a good listen too, you can understand most of the songs based of the melody in the background and you can see how the final Les Miserables was changed in my opinon for the better. Although hearing it sung in French gave a whole new meaning to the show- and it sounding more breathtaking and exquiste than it did before.It's true what they say everything sounds more beautiful in French!"
1,Enjoyable as Fiction,"With one glaring error the author puts the entire rest of the book into question. Hillary is said to have been compared to Al Haig who as Nixon's Chief of Staff tried to claim he was in charge immediately after that president's resignation. The event being rerred to was seen by millions on TV and occurred after Reagan was shot, while Haig was a cabinet member. Did anyone edit this book? How accurate are the much more obscure and intimate details of the story? Perhaps it was written to lend credence to the claims that the Clintons' critics are engaged in a vast right wing conspiracy of disinformation. Next year's scandal - Who paid Sheehy to botch this book?"
4,Dishy & Satisfying,"The Clintons' marriage may seem to be worked-over territory. But Sheehy, drawing on interviews with hundreds of subjects -- some of whom have kept silent until now -- breaks new ground in addressing the big question: Do the Clintons love one another -- or is it just a political partnership?Her answer: Hillary is addicted to Bill. ""He is her only rebellion,"" writes Sheehy, ""the one thing she can't logically explain."" The author charts the dog days of the Clintons' relationship, when, in the late '80s, Bill fell in love with a blonde Arkansas divorcée and Hillary contemplated divorce. Sheehy also explores Hillary's character -- her toughness, her ambition, her willingness to blame her husband's problems on others -- without suggesting these qualities are less appealing in a woman than in a man.A woman of addictions and ambitions and an interesting read."
1,Factually flawed,"The book reads well enough but it is so factually flawed that the Washington Post has started a ""Gail's Goofs"" column about this particular book listing all of the factual errors (six days running last I checked). Read Lloyd Grove's Reliable Source column in the Washington Post Style Section before you buy this book."
1,Negative reviewers of this book at least read it.,"Searching for a selection on this topic I browsed this book and Barbara Olson's Hell To Pay and then came here to read the reviews. It was interesting that the reviewers of Ms. Olson's book who did not like it gave no specifics or facts supporting their negative comments whereas the negative reviewers here were much more specific, detailed and helpful. I have only read about a third of this one and you should accordingly discount my opinions but this book has way too many verifiable factual errors and too many sections where a suspension of disbelief is required. I felt it a waste of money to buy this one and opted to purchase Ms. Olson's book based on the approximate third of it I read and the reviews."
2,Hillary Remains Analysis-Proof,"It must be frustrating for anyone trying to write a book about either of the Clintons. Although Sheehy is successful in humanizing the First Lady, she was unable to reveal anything of a truly personal nature about the First Lady. The personal relationship between the Clintons is opaque to the onlooker. Because they do not tend to give out personal information, the book merely rehashes what has already been surmised about this couple."
4,Compassionate Misanthrope,"I heard Gail Sheehy on public radio this morning talking about this book and Hillary. She came up with what I think is a defining phrase for Hillary...""Compassionate Misanthrope."" As I have followed Hillary's life, this sums up a lot about her -- she loves people in aggregate or in the broad sense of umbrella social programs, but there's a chilling side to her that often doesn't much like or appear to like people one-to-one. The book outlines in some detail how this is so. Recommended."
4,"Loved the Book, Concerned About the Innacuracies","I really enjoyed reading this book. I would have given it five stars, but I'm a little concerned about the inaccuracies people have mentioned in their reviews above.All in all though, I appreciate Gail's effort and thank her for writing the book. It has been an interesting read."
2,Nothing New Here,"The substance of these Clinton bios is wearing thin. I was disappointed with Ms. Sheehy's book. Basically, this is a longer version of an article she wrote in the February 1999 issue of last year's Vanity Fair Magazine. You are better off saving your money and finding that very well written article. We don't find out anything extraordinary in this book other than the revelation that Hillary had a passionate relationship with a ""dark Irish"" Georgetown grad pre Bill Clinton. How shocking! In addition, the revelation that Bill's falling in love with one of his enamoratas (Jane Doe #1) threatened their marriage is a well known fact. Save your money."
2,Not impressive,"I was eager to read this book, but unfortunately, I found it to be mostly an elaboration of Sheeehy's Vanity Fair article and a lot of nasty, mean spirited gossip about the Clinton's from unnamed sources. Sheehy seems to think a girl or young woman who is more interested in her grades than in clothes and makeup is disturbed in some way and she even includes several nasty remarks about Mrs. Clinton's weight, of all things,( of course made by unnamed people.) This does not meet any kind of standard of intelligent journalism. Sheehy also makes many obvious factual errors and her prose is, to say the least, overwrought."
3,Bad Motive,I have trouble with the whole book. The author is using the First Lady to promote herself. Just look at the cover. Her name is bigger than the book title! I don't know how much of the contents is based on imagination and unverified records. But a lot of those demand more in-depth and more objective analysis.
1,Just gossip,"This book really has nothing to do with Hillary or the Clintons -- it has everything to do with Gail Sheehy - her mean-spiritedness, her willingness to gossip, her jealousy, her arrogance, her pain. This book is not good journalism -- not recommended for anyone to read."
3,Hillary's Choice - who is this First Lady?,"Who is Hillary Clinton & where does she come from? Gail Sheehy has written a personable, detailed biography of this Midwesterner who grew up in a bright post-war world. In many things this First Lady is as ordinary as apple pie & as unusual as the 1960s. An absorbing saga of Anywoman of this era, the choices she made & the opportunities she took. A bit of a slog for us outsiders."
5,A five star Masterpiece!,"The best! Just the best! This book is King of the Hillary books. You can't get better detail. I laughed, I cried, I learned. It took my breath away. I know you will feel the same way."
3,I already knew most of the info.,Well I found the book to be factual and very facinating although I knew most of the facts in the book already. There is a lot of psychobabble but hey there has to be when you discuss the Clintons. One of the interesting things in the book is this other woman that Clinton supposely falls in love with. This book shows the complex relationship that this couple has but does not explain it as clearly as I would like to. Well if yo are interested in the couple and expecially HRC you will enjoy it.
1,Boring,"I received this book for Christmas. Basically it is the same old, same old about Hillary. There is nothing new here. It was very hard to read thru and I began to skip pages. Don't waste your money on this one, unless you've had your head in the sand for the past 8 years."
2,DISAPPOINTING!,"I was disappointed with this book because I felt the author was unfair to my idol throughout the book.I adore people like Hillary and Rosie O'Donnell because they feel in their hearts what America is all about and the author made it seem like Hillary is not always a saint.This is a shocking revelation to me because in front of the cameras,which is all that matters,Hillary understands the pain we Americans go through every day,but the author did not do a good job expressing this.I don't know why the author who should be an expert on the subject,did not emphasize what a sincere,honest woman she is.I hate to think I've been fooled by the media all these years.The author did have some good things to say about Hillary but overall she could have been a little nicer."
2,Oh Come On,"Well written, but defies logic. With all the affairs, the audio tapes of calls with Jennifer Flowers, how can anybody still believe Hillary Clinton was ignorant of his behavior? I expected more from Sheehy, something a bit closer to believability."
5,Once again we stand divided.,"It is so obvious as I read these reviews, the people who hated the book, obviously loved Hillary, and the people that loved the book, obviously don't. I liked it, so I guess that proves where I stand. If you love Hillary, don't bother, if you don't and wonder why in the world she would stay with this cheat, read on my friend, and you still probably won't. But maybe Hillary does."
5,A Davis Triumph,"Wolfgang Amadeus MozartSymphony No. 39Symphony No. 41 ""Jupiter""Sir Colin DavisStaatskapelle Dresdon (Dresden State Orchestra)Davis' touch with both these pieces is exactly right. Nothing here gets out of control and none of the grandeur is lost or overblown. This is a joy to hear. Five Stars."
2,Big Foot,"I usually like Easy Spirit shoes, but I wasn't thrilled with these sandals so I returned them. The quality was good, but they had strange soles which you couldn't tell from the picture. They weren't comfortable like my other Easy Spirits. The price was good, I'll give them a couple stars for that."
4,Very nice but didnt fit,"Love the style, perfect for me but the shoe was too tight in the toes, couldnt get my foot all the way in, the size was correct, i have numerous easy spirit shoes. These went back."
5,So comfortable!,This is my first pair of Easy Sprits and they won't be my last. My feet do not get sore or achy at all when walking in these. If I can walk around the Mall of America for hours and not have an achy back or feet I know they're good shoes!The uppermost strap is a stretchy material that does not dig into the foot--it moves with your foot. I am very happy with my purchase.
5,New York's Finest,"MANHATTAN NORTH is the second of NYPD Sgt.(Ret.) John Mackie's Thorn Savage novels, an exciting follow-up to MANHATTAN SOUTH.In this novel, Thorn is assigned to lead a special police task force investigating the killings of New York's most notorious drug kingpins. As Thorn closes in on the perpetrators, he and his become targets in the drug war.The very ""film noir"" ending is bleak and is worthy of the best of Dirty Harry. This series has definite screen potential.Although not as deftly plotted as MANHATTAN SOUTH, MANHATTAN NORTH moves along at terminal velocity, a real turn-the-page cop thriller."
3,Well done.,The literary level is comic book. The villain is nasty enough. The Death Wish - type pursuit is well done.
5,Love it!!,"I just love this holster. My phone never fall from my waist anymore, unlike with my old broken holster, my phone constantly found on the floor. My Nokia 6202 fits snugly in this holster and the clip holds well wherever I clipped it. I was charged $15.00 at a mall cellphone stand, good I didn't buy it."
4,Fun!,"My husband loved the Raiders lights, and plans to use them year round--they will be decorating the awning of our camping trailer!"
1,"Failed Methodology, Rash Claims","While at the surface this may appear to be a great book, underneath lies a foundation of flaws. First of all, the entire book is based off of a .25 correlation. For anyone that knows anything about correlations, that is anything but strong. The other huge mistake the authors make is to imply causation-- increases in leadership will lead to increases in student achievement. Have you ever heard, ""correlation does not imply causation""? That saying is there for a reason. The authors spend the entire book making rash, over-interpreted claims based on a correlation from a study that has more methodological flaws than can even be discussed here. Save you money or if you so choose to buy it, READ WITH CAUTION!!"
2,Marzano-No new info. and potentially harmful,"Marzano et.al.'s book brings nothing new to the discussion of what works in school leadership. If anything, he just took what is pretty much commonly accepted into a different format and made it look new. As I was reading the book I thought, ""Oh well, another $30 down the drain but no harm, no foul."", until I got to page 85 and saw the sample standards based report card. It's a teacher's nightmare and would lead to massive subjectivity (how do you assigned a % every day to every student for class participation and following rules??) being represented as objective data. I hope no admin. ever takes that to heart and implements it in their school. I should probably try to find out but for them to present that as a good reporting tool, I just can't believe Marzano et. al. have ever taught in a classroom."
1,How I was ripped off,"The bag that I ordered was not as advertised - it did not fit on my Snapper mower -and when I returned it, they never credited me with what I paid. So I have no bag and no refund."
3,Interesting mother -son history,"Roy Blount Jr. writes a rambling account of growing up with his strong yet troubled mother -- a woman who despite an abusive upbringing herself managed to raise a son and a daughter with little help from a good but passive husband to be individuals with a strong sense of themselves. Blount is funny and he makes good points about the defensive nature of humor, the lurking self-loathing beneath the humorist. The only turnoff in this saga is that as a middle-aged man, Blount still is in rebellion against his mother for her guilt trips, so much so that he can't, it seems, ""be sweet"" to the women in his personal life whom he claims he has loved. Otherwise a good read for anyone intersted in family relationships and 1950s nostalgia."
4,"An amazing book; very serious, but still true to past work","I was very surprised by this book on a number of levels. I've thought Blount's past works were funny, but also quite well thought out. Blount is never ""funny"" in the sense that Dave Berry is funny. There is no silliness about Blount; he is firmly grounded in reality.This work is very serious. It is his attempt to displell his ""family curse."" He explores his relationships with his parents, sister, and ex-wives. He speculates on the nature of humor and humorists.I thought the book was brilliant. It's like Blount is willing to talk about things that no one else will because doing so would sound stupid, but it's still what you want to say.An added bonus is Blount's voice. He is not a particularly elegant reader. But it is hard to imagine any other voice reading this work. I compare it to Jean Shepard, who also has the perfect voice for his own work."
4,Ingeniously written but a little self-indulgent,"By the end of this book, I knew for certain that it was worth reading although I had many doubts until then. Blount made me laugh and made me marvel at his skill, but he also bored me with his self-loathing and longueurs. The chapter on the troubles of men named after their fathers (juniors) was excruciatingly dull, and forgot to make mention of Hank Williams Junior, one of the most grandiose sufferers from this syndrome. Worse, Blount junior never really explained what made his mother so maddening. Nevertheless, he tells very well how he finally came to value what she (and his father) gave to him."
1,"Self-absorbed, self-indulgent, unfunny whine-fest","This book is several things. One thing it is NOT is funny. Blount worries that, having attained the age of 55, he is experiencing some sort of humorist's change of life and is no longer capable of evoking guffaws. Well, then, this book is a self-fulfilling prophesy. In the process, we get to squirm through such incessent dissing of his mother that we want to turn our heads in embarrassment; so much what-did-I-do-wrong whining about lost loves that we're inclined to ""card"" him to see if he's really past 15; and yet more tired and feeble attempts at what, I suppose, is to pass for ""Southern humor."" If this is the best we're to expect from Blount as he flounders through middle age, he ought to confine himself to his periodic appearances with Garrison Keillor, reading jokes sent in by people who know what ""funny"" really is."
5,Fun,I purchased this book for my first two grandchildren and now for the third who is due in March. For the first two I printed pictures of their Mom and Dad and glued them over the faces on the last page. They loved it. Now the third is on the way and I will do the same for him. Just a fun thing for when they are here with Nana and waiting for Mom and Dad to come home.
5,Perfect size,These dishes are the perfect size for those small servings. Use them everyday for cereal and frequently for soup. Stack inside each other so don't take up much space in the cupboard.
1,Not worth the money I paid ($1.95),"I bought this book used and found that it was too simple to even be considered a book. Mr. Disalvatore seems like the type of author that got published because he knew someone not because he produced a good book.This book was difficult to get into and even more difficult to follow. I know several people who tried to read this after I lent it to them and none of them would have bought it for themselves. Do not buy this book, it's better used in your fireplace for a little warmth."
3,Beyond Atlantis II - Nice adventure,"Great graphics and interesting story line. Most puzzles are challenging but not impossible. Smooth installation on an HP Pavilion. Playback of some videos and some audio tends to be jerky and interrupted. Needed to set compatibility mode to ""Windows 95"" to run on an XP SP2 system."
5,Love these...,"I use these in my cookbooks, I can write on the tab to mark my favorite recipes. They are also movable, great little idea, glad I ordered them!!!"
5,Exactly how it looks,They came really fast. Was exactly what I ordered and at a great price. I would definitely order from here again.
1,Boooooooo,I was disappointed because I was expecting to get larger flags and they are about the size of a large paperclip.
3,"Strong start, rushed end","Ok, so I'm a little late in reviewing this one, it's been out awhile, and I finally gave this one attention over the other hoards of stuff I buy and eventually get too... anyways, enough of that. This started off as a really strong novel, it was quick to set things up, had some very compelling characters, great dialog, off humor, it had it all. It created a great con game and set it up well, had you hoping for the cons, stick it to the badder cons! Problem is, you're over 1/2 way through the book and things are still being set up, doesn't leave much room left for the conclusion... which was, surprise, rushed. I don't know if he was pressed for time, got fed up writing, the cab was out there waiting for him or what, but after such a great set up and things start rolling, it just flew through the last bit. Guess it was to show that it all happened quickly, but still... disappointing. It's well worth reading, maybe deserves more stars but that just a bit of a let down to me."
2,Honestly!!,"The book was mediocre at best. You think it would be hard to turn such dramatic events into such boredom, but apparently it is possible. Their is no suspense, I wonder what is going to happen next, at all. Read it if you have nothing else to read, that is why I read it."
2,Remarkably boring,"The description sounds cool, right? Con man, Africa, the Detroit mob - all mixed up into a ""witty, fast-paced"" book? Not so. Pages and pages of repetitive dialogue, boring details, and conversations that add nothing to the storyline. I found myself skipping ahead several times to get past the fluff. Even the meat of the story is rather second-rate. You keep hoping that it'll get exciting, pick up the pace a bit, but are disappointed. Anyone accustomed to good work by Frederick Forsyth, Ludlum, Michael Connelly, David Baldacci or John Grisham will be sorely disappointed. Please look elsewhere."
2,Good mindless entertainment for a day or two at the beach,"The most recent book of the man who wrote Get Shorty. Excellent dialogue, shallow charaters, simple plot. This novel is engaging and funny but not thought-provoking as one had the rigth to expect when the Rwandan genocide is used as backdrop for the story. It serves no purpose at all and is completely wasted dramatically. Alas, this is nothing more than good mindless entertainment for a day or two at the beach."
1,Typical and formula,"After I read this latest by Leonard I decided ""no more"". How anyone can think his characters are believable is beyond me. They are bland. And another thing...the author is a shamless name-dropper. He had to name everything in Royal Oak, MI. It wasn't enough to say the characters went to a comedy club...or a restaurant...Leonard had to point out and name everything. His plots are too simple. As for being humorous. There wasn't anything even mildly funny about PAGEN BABIES. Debbie's routine wasn't amusing at all. I should have listened to my husband when he said I would be wasting my time reading PAGEN BABIES."
5,Another winner from Elmore Leonard,"What do a phony priest, an addled hit-man, an ex-con/comedienne, and an aging Mafia don with prostate cancer have in common? To find out, you'll just have to read this latest bit of lunacy from Elmore Leonard. I don't want to give away any of the sometimes convoluted plot, except to say that it kept me reading, and in stitches at some of the dialogue. Where Leonard dreams up these characters is totally beyond my comprehension, but I hope that he keeps doing it for a long, long time."
4,Snappy,"This was my first elmore leonard book and I am very pleased that I read it. The comedic elements in this book had me cracking up, meanwhile trying to figure out what would happen in the end when everything came together. It didn't have an very shocking ending, but I was pleased with the way things turned out. Terry, the protagnist who escaped a imminent indictment to become a psuedo priest in Rwanda, is very quick witted, and once teamed up with comic on the rise recently released convict Debbie there conversations are some of the wittiest I've read in a while. My one problem with the book is that it seems that the caper is very long in the making, and all in all it doesnt take up much space in the 260 page book. I wish there were more of the actual crime, but the dialouge was fabulous. A good read."
3,Mediocre book,"This was my first attmept at Elmore Leonard. I have read Carl Hiaasen, and John Sanford and was told that if I liked Hiaasen then I HAD to read Leonard. So I picked up his latest in paperback, Pagan Babies, for a long flight to Europe and back. Please tell me that this isn't the quintessential Elmore Leonard book! If so, then I am highly dissappointed. The book wasn't bad, but it wasn't that good either. There was no zing, no suspense, no real humor. The characters of Terry Dunn and Debbie were not ones that I felt connections with, or even really cared to read more about. Some of the smaller characters were more enjoyable: Randy, The Mutt, and Johnny Pajonny, but it ends there. The book coasted along at a relaxed, but easy pace. I will try another Leonard book (someday) before giving up on him. Hopefully, I will have better luck."
1,DID HE WRITE THIS IN HIS SLEEP?,"I had heard great things about Elmore Leonard's writing, so I thought I'd give PAGAN BABIES a try. Maybe his other books are gems, but I fear I picked a stinker with this one. The story seemed promising---Father Terry is a priest on the lam in Rwanda at the time of the Tutsi-Hutu tribal wars. But Leonard writes about the Rwandan genocide without much insight nor care about the characters. His writing didn't move me to a single emotion except maybe boredom. The prose is so dull; not a single line made me sit up and take notice, and I often felt lost in the story (in a bad way) so reading every page was a real chore. You'd have to twist my arm to read another one of his books. I guess it pays to be a famous writer...they'll even publish your dregs."
4,"Entertaining, Fast Read","This is my 3rd EL book (Get Shorty and Stay Cool)and I enjoyed it. It is laugh-outloud funny in places. There has to be a Mutt book in the future. Maybe Mutt and Mary Pat meet Fr. Terry in Rhwanda.Anyway, the book is fast-paced and enjoyable throughout. You know it is a good book when you are looking for opportunities to read. This was one such book."
3,I read the whole thing on the plane from Ireland,"Shouldn't a book, whose launching pad is the killing of 800,000 people in Rwanda, and the intensely personal horror of witnessing 47 people hacked to death in a church where they sought sanctuary while one said Mass, be more than an effortless story about a sociopath? I guess not. And who am I to talk? I bought the thing. I read the thing. It's just that I kept waiting for something to happen to indicate some effect of all those hundreds of thousands of personal tradegies. But then again, it's about a sociopath. One's not supposed to sympathise with them or root for them. It's just a story about one of them.And that's all it is."
4,Great tool,"The only flaws I have found is the rubber strip that prevent scratches on the leading edge of the brake is not pinched in place so it slids out of the track, the tape on the brake fades to the point it can not be read, the hindge points are made of steel and rust in time, the locking pins for the handles need to be replaced with latch pins. The balls rust and make it almost impossable to remove them."
3,what happened to quality,"Twenty plus years of using Tapco products and I never questioned the higher price due to quality. Now between the manufacturer, seller, or shipper, who's to blame for mine that now I question the purchase. Plus the ""snap-stand"" doesn't come with it, I knew that but pictures are deceiving. Many other American brands are coming with more accessories at less/equal pricing."
4,"Tapco 10558 Pro 19 10'6"" wide by 19"" Throat Portable Brake","This unit is well constructed but could be improved by providing a better user's manual. If you are not familiar with using a brake the poorly written manual is little help. I actually thought my unit wasn't working properly until I called the support staff. I found out that one simple detail left out of the manaul made a big difference. Also the manual provides no information regarding the dimensional limits to bending. The 19"" depth is nice and it does a good job bending aluminum stock. However, there is room to improve it and make it a better tool. It is still worth having if you do any aluminum trim."
5,Tapco 10558 PRO 19 10-Foot-6-Inch Wide by 19-Inch Throat Portable Brake,Purchase at a great price. Easy to use and a great help when vinyl siding my house. Adjustments needed are easily made using the clear and concise instructions.
2,Not quite what I expected,This design could be alot better. For the price I expected a more robust tool. In use I used my tape measure more than I used this tool. I'll give it some more time.
2,Useless for diagonals,"I found this tool unusable for laying tile on the diagonal. I would imagine it is acceptable for straight cuts on a square layout, but awfully expensive when there are other methods for that. The video is not bad and includes a lot of footage on laying tile in general, but is that why you buy this thing? I found the measurement inordinately sensitive to placement and, after many tries, just could not make it generate an acceptable measurement on a diagonal cut. I would say it might be useful for someone with off-square walls. Even then, the price for this piece of plastic seems hard to justify."
2,cheez whiz,"I would not recommend this product. It is a measurement tool made from very flexible plastic. The one shipped to me had a bent/curved edge on it. It sticks and is difficult to slide. The angle tilt head is difficult to screw tight, yet needs to be loose during the initial steps of taking a measurement. You sepnd a lot of time trying to get it tight, then loose. The result was very poor precision on numerous cuts. I found it much easier to hold the tile against the surface I was fitting, and simply draw the lines I needed to get the right angle. The video enclosed was actually the most helpful item in the box."
1,W.Doherty,"When i opened the box that my Angle wiz (a.k.a. Cheese wiz.) came in the first thing i did was laugh . How could anyone make something so cheap,but after i stopped laughing i thought i would give it a try . Well, it lasted about 10 minutes and went in the dumpster. This is possibly the worlds most usless tool.Every piece of this plastic tool is bowed.However as others have said in their reviews this is a great design but oh so poorly manufactured."
1,What A Joke,"Ididn't purchase this item myself, I borrowed it from a friend. I tested it out when I put down ceramic tile in my kitchen. Without going into great detail let me just say ""WHAT A PIECE OF GARBAGE"". THIS HAS GOT TO BE THE CHEAPEST IMITATION OF A LAYOUT TOOL THAT I HAVE EVER SEEN. Take whatever money that you would spend on this and by a good tile installation book and straight edge. If you could rate items in negative values this ""tool"" would take top honors."
5,tile flooring made easy,"I questioned the usefulness of this tool untill i tried it for myself. all of my hard to figure angles were a breeze with the wizard,and no wasted tiles,Its a must try tool. thankyou, wayne b burton"
4,A Different Look at Birthdays,"Birthdays are intensely personal events, some happy, others bittersweet. This book provides insights into how celebrities reacted to, celebrated, mulled over and contemplated their own birthdays or those of relatives and friends. Among the little-known tales: What Bob Dylan did on his 30th, Marilyn Monroe's ""steamy"" rendition of ""Happy Birthday"" to her ""friend,"" JFK, the gift sci-fi writer Isaac Asimov bought for himself and the birthday poem Anne Frank's father wrote her while the family was hiding from the Nazis. It's a gift book that both entertains and puts perspective into birthdays."
5,One of the most significant films of the century,"This is an essential film, because of this early discussion of feminist themes, depiction of an orgnized working class, and evidence of the quality work produced by these black listed film producers and actors."
3,A Curio... Little Else,"Funded by the International Union of Mine, Mill and Smelter Workers, produced by blacklisted filmmakers and containing what was argued to be Communist propaganda, Salt of the Earth reflects many of the themes of similar stories such as 'The Grapes of Wrath' and 'The Jungle'. The film is competently produced, though its inexpensiveness is often evident. The print offered here is not particularly impressive, featuring occasionally scratchy picture and pops in the soundtrack. The story revolves around a young New Mexican mining couple and their struggle to obtain more favorable working conditions. Issues of worker's rights coincide with feminist ideals and race relations to form a powder keg of frustration and fear. The film was blacklisted in the U.S. upon release. This fact, combined with the ground-breaking subject matter, makes the film interesting as a curio, though I doubt few would know of it if it had been screened and merely dismissed."
4,Does the job.,"Works pretty much as advertised. It does go on thinner than I'd like, but additional coats take care of that. I originally found it odd that the instructions said to remove the tool very slowly from the container after dipping, but I quickly understood why - the product will flow slowly off the tool and leave long ""drips"" otherwise. But, other than that, it works just fine. The dried coating is notably thinner than it appears after first removing from the can, but as I said, re-coats will thicken up the finished treatment."
3,Colors...,"OK, here's the deal with Plasti-Dip. I found this on another website, and went through the colors one by one to develop the below table. Colors are identified by the digits just before the dash. So:11601-6 = RED11602-6 = YELLOW11603-6 = BLACK11604-6 = BLUE11607-6 = WHITE11609-6 = CLEARIt took a little while to figure out the pattern. These part numbers are for the 14.5 fl oz dip, but the other types use the same two digit code (01-09) for the colors, and the other numbers change for the type (aerosol, etceteras)."
1,Disappointing experience with otherwise high quality brand.,"Allen Edmonds Men's MacNeil Genuine Shell Cordovan Wingtip OxfordI'd wanted these for a long time and when they went on sale I grabbed a pair. The pair that showed up, which turned out to be the last in my size, were clearly, grossly irregular. I called Amazon for an exchange and that wasn't an option as they were out of stock. I called AE in hopes they'd simply exchange what was obviously defective for a pair that were 1st quality. AE insisted that the shoes had to go back to Amazon for exchange. So, I wound up returning them, which was a real heartbreaker, as with the exception of the manufacturing errors (uneven attachment of the two pieces of leather that hold the laces only on the left shoe...a good 3/4"" off), they were great shoes. I will continue to look for another pair."
2,Not worth the extra cost,"Not worth the money. After about 2 months the wipers fell apart and started streaking very badly and this was before it even started snowing. Maybe the wipers reacted with the windshield washer fluid but I was totally unimpressed with this product. Your money is better spend buying standard wiper blades and replacing more often, no better mouse trap here."
1,Doesn't fit 2011 Malibu,"The wiper blade is probably good quality. Unfortunately, it is advertised to fit the 2011 Chevy Malibu. The Malibu requires a specific type of connector to the arm. This blade does not have the right type of connection. Don't waste your time or money. Just go to Auto Parts store, spend $20 (per blade - huge ripoff) to get the blade you need."
2,This depresses me,"The album is as good as it was in 1988. There is one slight problem, though...the last two tracks were omitted. If you can find an original release of this album, opt for it instead. IWO JIMA and One For the Road are missing from this recording and they are at least as important to the album as anything that you will hear."
3,"GOOD, BUT NO PHOTOS","This book contains a great narative by a Belgian fighter pilot. The only thing atypical for this kind of biography (first published in 1986 - so a recent one) is that there are no photos at all, what is a shame!"
3,STANDARD FIGHTER PILOT WRITTEN BOOK,"In a good style of writing, the author talks about his exploit in WW II, since escaping from invaded Belgium in 1940 to commanding 609 Squadron (Royal Air Force) in 1944. Great book."
4,Good first-hand account,"Demoulin was a Belgian fighter pilot in RAF druing WW II, flying with the famous 609 Squadron (about this squadron there is a book written by their Intelligence Officer, Frank Ziegler, called ""UNDER THE WHITE ROSE""). It's a typiacl tale of a fighter pilot: burning with the desire to fly, losing comrades to accdents and enemy action, shooting down German planes and on and on. Demoulin even became the Squadron's Comanding Officer, adn flew some 250 operational missions."
2,varies from satisfactory to maudlin,"Though Professor Gould's scientific writing glows, this collection of his musings on baseball varies from satisfactory to maudlin. His total bias toward his hometown New York is understandable, but his twisting of statistics to laud his heroes, and the fact that this posthumous collection does not properly credit his fellow SABR members' research is unfortunate. The foreword by David Halberstam is heartfelt, but strikes me as praising Professor Gould's baseball acumen too highly."
3,Did he root for the Yankees????,"Two things are crystal after the first eight or so essays in <i>Triumph</i>: Gould hails from New York, and he grew up rooting for the Yankees.That's, apparently, all he had to say in the first section.I hated it: an egocentric and elongated indulgence into his childhood, peppered with snippets of baseball history to build up his credibility.But the tone shifted.<i>Triumph</i> comes in four pieces: one's the aforementioned section on Gould himself; the second's on ""hereos,"" including Mantle and Thorpe; third's on baseball as a sport and a piece of culture, and the fourth's a collection of book and movie reviews.If you can stomach (or skip) the 47 pages of ""Reflections and Experiences,"" do it: the rest is surprisingly pleasant. You'll find good works on why Jim Thorpe might be the greatest athlete ever, why The Babe (the movie) was terrible, and the creation myths of baseball.He's not Roger Angell, but Gould did pretty well."
3,Less than half the price = less than half as good?,"A reason to use the product for a while before reviewing:We mow three acres basically once a week and always bag the grass. (I know: not good, but the wife is obsessive about grass drug in the house by the kids.) In all, an average of 100 hours a year on the John Deere between grass and leaf pick-up.We got six years out of the original Deere bags. After one season of use, I figure we'll get probably two seasons out of these bags. Currently, one handle is ripped off, and a few corners of the bags are starting to pull apart.In the end, its a trade-off: At less than half the O.E. replacement cost, we'll get less than half the use out of them. If you don't use yours as much, or are maybe a little more careful with the bags than my son probably is, these may be the replacement bags for you."
2,Not the black bag pictured,Not the black bag it is replacing. It is white. Not sure it fits correctly.
3,Ok,"Id venture to say that this book is like most other Anna Riva book. It has some useable information and some crap. The ""ten commandments"" of Anna Riva presented at the beginning here are a joke. I enjoyed the authors pattern for dolls and her section on doll sorcery, along with some of the information presented on various roots and stones. For the price this book isn't bad, buy it as a curio and maybe you might get something out of it."
1,Not as good as it should be,This Revere measure cup has barely readable (in excellent light) measurement indications on the inside of the cup. Big disappointment. It does look nice but I didn't buy it for looks.
5,Quality Film At A Bargain Price,"I bought two packs of this film (100 pictures in all) as a birthday gift for my girlfriend along with the Polaroid One600 Ultra Instant Camera and she absolutely loves it! She has already taken a few pictures and they have come out surprising good for Polaroid film. The price seemed high at first until I dug around online and found out that Polaroid discontinued this film late last year, which really sucks! What are they thinking right! I plan on buying A WHOLE LOT more of this film soon before it gets impossible to find it."
4,600 Polaroid Film,Product arrived on time and in excellent condition. Worked great with our cameras and the kids loved the event. Thanks!
4,Where else is there?,"Product is excellent though price, after shipping and handling was steep and expiration date was within a month; but where else can you get film that isn't expired yet?"
5,Tough.,"At the age of 22, being a female, I've had many different hair styles and gone through a variety of products from gels to promades. However, no wax has held up like Paul Mitchell's dry wax!My haircut is short and includes a lot of different lengths to give it a very edgy, rockstar appeal. Many gel's are just not tough enough to define those lengths.Paul Mitchell's dry wax is tough! I am able to shape and piece my hair, knowing that it will last throughout the day. It's the closest thing to wax there is. Don't fall for containers that say wax, but are in actuality thin and ""goopy.""The only ""Con"" that I have for this product, would be that it is very tough to wash off of your hands. Then again, it IS wax! You will definetly have to scrub to get the remaining wax off your hands AND off your sink. But it is certainly a price I am willing to pay for great hair!!!"
5,EXCELLENT FOR FINE HAIR!,"THIS PRODUCT IS THE ONLY THING I WILL USE TO SCULPT & SHAPE MY HAIR. IT DOESN'T WEIGHT YOUR HAIR DOWN & ALITTLE BIT GOES A LONG, LONG WAY! A SINGLE JAR WILL LAST YEARS!"
4,Great tool for the right situation,"No one likes nails scattered around their house, but this happens during the course of a building project. As a contractor I found the 30"" rolling magnetic sweeper a great tool to have on remodel jobs, new construction, and even small shop projects. The magnet height is easy to adjust, and clean up is a snap. I did have trouble using the tool over rough terrain. If the wheels fell into low areas or the magnet made contact with a hill, some nails would fall off. Conversely, if the wheels went over high ground or the magnet was centered on a valley, it wouldn't pick up the nails. Also after pulling up on the red handle to clean the magnet, make sure to push it back down so it sits square again, otherwise you will not have the full strength of the magnet working for you. Other than that it really worked great! I am very pleased with my purchase."
3,Ok but a little ratty,"Bought a pair for our 4 cats at the local pet shop. They work ok, but leave the nail with a bit of a ratty rough cut.going to try a scissor type next maybe? Seems hard to find a good quality trimmer."
4,"Simple, creative ideas","This book is full of DIY project ideas - from shelves to headboards to decorative accessories. Some of the ideas I'd like to try, others I have no interest in trying - just not my style. Most of the projects are simple and use basic items in different, sometimes not so appealing, ways."
4,baltimore Sounds,"I remember viewing this book when my ex-husband had it. As a long time resident of Baltimore, I was pleasantly surprised to see a lot of the groups, that I grew up listening to, listed in this book. I know that one reader was dissapointed, with a misquote or two, but I realize that the best way to fix that is to constantly supply info for updating. All in all I loved the book, and am looking forward to volume 2, because actually viewing hometown singers listed for all the world to see can never be a bad thing. Most of these singers would have otherwise gone unnoticed, if not for this publication. hats Off To Joe!!!!!"
5,Let us Run with Hope,To have hope as depicted in these true life stories is like trading sorrow for joy. Let us run with hope. We have yet to realize all the intangible benefits of allowing hope to carry us through any hardship. Jerome Groopman's ability to be vulnerable as well as a master story teller makes this book a must read.Laura Lee SolbergHeirborne Media Productions
4,a book for any feeling or unfeeling person,"I thought the book was moving, inspirational, novel in the field, but importantly not novel in the lives of patients. An important read for every living and breathing person, young and ALL."
3,textbooks,"college course required readings or textbooks, served their purpose, good shape and arrived on time for classes, easy way to get cheaper books"
3,Enjoyable,I like the way Dr. Groopman writes and have always enjoyed his pieces in the New Yorker. This book was no different.
3,Not bad...,"This book was recommended to me by a fellow medical student as a way to explore oncology and the situations I should prepared to face. It's more of a lightweight exploration of an individual's interpretation of Hope as he grows from intern to experienced practitioner.There's nothing hugely insightful or provocative, and the Ivy league viewpoint is a bit much, but it's a fast read."
3,Just a few anekdotes - disappointing.,"I was disappointed by this book. It is only a bunch of anekdotes. Some people have hope although they shouldn't, some have no hope although they have a good outlook. It's random, there is no analysis or theory on ""How"" to hope. Some do, some don't, some survive, some die. No insight here."
1,Tedious,"I'm sorry but I found this very tedious. I read a lot and I have never been prompted to give a review before, but I think you should be forwarned.Though I did learn about several kinds of cancer and a bit about the process of becoming a wise and humane physician, I did not learn anything new about the anatomy of hope.If you're a die hard scientist and have to be spoon fed anything that is other, and you have been living under a rock for the last 20 years, perhaps you'll get something out of this book."
1,A Toxic Dump Masquerading as Journalism,"This book is a disgraceful effort to smear Richard Nixon and his family by relying on second- and third-had sources, most of whom are either unidentified or dead. It doesn't meet even the most basic standards of journalism -- any freshman history student who handed in a paper so flawed and so lacking in documentation would be given a failing grade. I think the Nixon family should sue the author and publisher for slander and defamation. No one should be allowed to publish such smears without any credible verification."
5,There Is No Defense Of Nixon,"Believe me folks..you get your money's worth before less than half of the book in the chapters on Bebe Rebozo, Murray Chotiner, Helen Douglas and Cuba. Nixon wasn't fit to be dog catcher let alone President..How many Mob payoffs, bribes, umpteenth Lies on important matters,, Dirty Tricks,occurring way before he became President as Summers shows in multitude( and many of Summers sources are people directly connected to the events they describe etc. so the people knocking this book here and in the Media are living in fairy tale land). does it take to realize the guy was devious human sewage from lierally the get go. Could you imagine Nixon during The Cuban Missile Crisis? Too scary to contemplate."
1,"Politically invented, Float story becomes fact.","Both parties make up ""stuff"" that they float out through the media to see what the reaction is. This author took a lot of ""stuff"": with no basis in fact and tried to make a buck and to pile on a man that was brought down in a silent coupe."
2,Unrewarding,"There's a wealth of fascinating, behind-the-scenes detail to this book, but on the whole I found too many instances where the author was plugging the gaps with his own imagination. Unbiased works about Nixon are hard to find, and I didn't find one here. It would be refreshing to come across a text that seeks neither to vilify nor redeem Nixon's public image. Perhaps, given the damage he did to political idealism in this country, it simply isn't possible to approach him without an agenda. Or maybe we just need more time to go by before we try to digest his impact on American life."
1,More left-wing tripe.,"Can't we put this all behind us and get on the people's business?In the case of WJC, sure. In the case of RMN, never.More left-wing tripe."
1,And I thought Birth of a Nation was Bad!,This book is so fake that at times it is humorous. It reminds of that film Birth of a Nation. The book is that much of a distortion of Richard Nixon.
4,An enlightening book about an American President,"I was shocked by not only what I read, but what I found documented in the copious Source notes in the back. There is so much we didn't know about the damage that was done to the office of the Presidency in order to satisfy one man's need for power. What I found most tragic was the realization that we are also not ready for the truth in this country about our leaders. A week of watching the media on this book has convinced me that we are afraid to learn from our own history--and may be doomed to repeat it in our choices at election time. A brilliant book."
3,Arrogance at its worst,"This book was easy to read and well documented at 600 plus pages. This book gives solid detail with interviews with first hand people through the year 2000. Although the book seems to be very thoroughly researched, the author's bias against his subject comes through very clearly."
2,The prosecution rests,"This book by Anthony Summers is a prosecution of the presidency of Richard Nixon and his subject provides him with plenty of material. I would not call it a hatchet job, but I would not call it an accurate history either. Summers is obsessive with his footnotes, but it is the context of these anecdotes that seems awry.Summers make no real attempt at balance and Nixon's achievements are sidelined in his rush for the dirt of his presidency. And there is plenty of dirt to be found. I preferred Kutler's dissection in War's of Watergate: The Last Crisis of Richard Nixon to Summers' extended tabloid newspaper-style trashing. I am no fan of Nixon, but I am an opponent of senstationalism dressing up as accurate history.Bad, bad history."
1,Full of Silly Lies,This writer apparently learned his history from watching Oliver Stone movies. It is filled with absurd lies from start to finish. Vitriolic Nixon haters will love it. People who have some preference for learning truth or gaining insight into historical events will get no benefit from this trash.
1,"Gossip, gossip","This book is the equivalent of a British tabloid article on Richard Nixon. It is just a collection of gossip with very little historical background. I mean how intersting is it to know that Nixon might have had a problem with impotence. Summers couldn't confirm it, so why even write about it in the first place. I really feel that this book was a total disgrace to Nixon. Yes, Nixon had many of faults, but he also did some good things for this country. As an avid reader of Richard Nixon biographies, this is by far the worst and least objective. It seems that Summers has a personal vendetta against Nixon. Try reading the Ambrose books on the Nixon."
4,A rare case of a hatchet job that should be read,"This is a hatchet job on Nixon; make no mistake about it. No attempt is made to understand why anyone would admire him. Nonetheless, this is a book that serious readers should read.Other reviewers have detailed the list of sins that are discussed. And if we restrict ourselves ONLY to confirmed documents, the Nixon tapes, and the comments of those who worked for and with him, we would have to conclude that Nixon was a tortured, unpleasant man who probably had no moral center.I am motivated to read a more ""balanced"" biography. But that next book better deal with the horrors documented by Summers or it will start to look like a whitewash.So I recommend that you read this excellently written book, even though it is so one-sided. Ordinarily, I would not do that. But Nixon soiled himself with so much dirt over his career that a compenduim of his flaws simply needs to be put on the table."
2,Arrogance of Author,"There's no need to spin tales to develop a serious critique of Richard Nixon, yet Anthony Summers begins and ends his own yarns from cover to cover of this poorly researched, yet convincingly written fable.From his claim that young Richard ""devoured"" Dale Carnegie's book ""How To Win Friends and Influence People"" at the age of 11 (12 years before the Carnegie book was published) to his unfounded creation of Nixon the wife beater, Summers attempts to muster belief in his myths by stating them as facts and adding twists of irony and wryness as he goes along.Add this one to your Nixon collection only to keep it complete."
5,workhorse personal or small business printer,"I bought this 5 years ago and print about 500 pages per month. This printer has been sturdy, fast and reliable, seems to be efficient with toner etc."
2,Only Cheap,"I must say I was disappointed about the printer. I bought one from Frys a month ago. Setup was quick and easy. Printed test page, and some word doc OK.When I tried to print a direction from Yahoo map, it shows horizontal white bars. Try it couple times, it happened randomly.Called support, waited for over 25 mins. Then I was asked to clean the drum unit. No help. Went to level 2 support. Rep insisted it is the connection problem.I have to get new parallel cable, and new USB cable. Tried both. No help. It happens randomly, so don't know what it is.Still waiting for an answer from Brother.I am not happy with the printer."
1,Under-whelmed & Disappointed,"Two problems:1.) Poor print quality, especially on B&W photos/graphics. The 5040 would not print a full range of tones. No black, just a weak dark gray. Plus roller marks. Un-showable results for sales kits.2. Print controls were installed in Swedish rather than English. My tech friends and I spent hours on correcting this language issue, then we gave up. I boxed the printer and returned it."
2,High-Pitched Squeal,"A fast, inexpensive printer with good quality output but one major drawback: this printer gives off a high-pitched squeal that is especially noticeable when it goes into sleep mode. When I first got the printer, I thought the squeal may be caused by some weird interference with my PC so I moved it to a different electrical circuit but the squeal continued.I then returned the printer to Amazon for a new one (Amazon handled the return great, by the way) but the replacement had the exact same problem so it must be an issue with this model. I had an HP LaserJet before this and it most certainly did not make this noise so this is not simply a problem endemic to all laser printers.In an office setting, the squeal may not be too bothersome because of all the ambient noise but in a home office it is quite annoying."
4,"Good, fast printer except for one thing...","Like one of the reviewers said below, the printer occasionally prints out a page with a blank space/white line running horizontally across it. When this happens, it's always with a multi-page document (usually on page 2 ONLY of the document, go figure)!I've tried just about all the troubleshooting tips included in the Brother manual, but the problem still periodically occurs. I've never experienced this kink with any other printer, whether laser or inkjet. Please note that the blank space/white line doesn't appear all the time--if it did, I of course would have returned the printer, pronto! I haven't contacted Brother's customer service dept. yet.While kinda annoying, the quirkiness (if you will) is not a big deal to me. The affected page always re-prints out fine.Regarding envelopes, I haven't experienced jamming or any other problem. Once in a while, the printed address comes out a bit crooked, but this happens at times with my trusty HP inkjet, too."
4,Watch out for the squeal,"When I bought this printer I was initially very pleased. It gave good sharp print quality and the print speed was very quick.However, after the printer was idle for 5 minutes it entered a low power sleep mode, and then the problem began. The printer started to emit a very high-pitched whistle. It was not exactly loud, but the pitch made it extremely irritating and it soon started to give me a headache.I returned the machine for a replacement and I am glad to report that the new machine does not have this fault. However I have noticed from other reveiws of this printer that several other users have experienced the same problem, so this may be a quality control issue."
1,Pointless,This product is terrible. The flags don't have enough adhesive to stay put and if you have more than one set of documents they'll move around and get caught on other papers. You definitely can't reuse them like you can the Post-It brand flags. The clear film that holds the flags will slip out of the dispenser and defeats the one-handed point of the dispenser since you have to hold the film taught to press out a flag. I strongly recommend against purchasing this product.
1,heh,"""The Samurai: The Philosophy of Victory"" By Robert T. Samuel is a so so book at best.Some of the information came from sources such as the Book of five rings and Hagakure, these sources are sometimes biased and often did not refer to samurai culture but just the lives of the author. A frightening note is that the rest of the material seems ot be directly plagarized from both internet rescources, such as the Samurai Archives and material written by Dr. Stephen Turnbull. Overall I defintly cannot recomend this book."
1,Do not buy this book,"This book is horrible! I am a samurai/ninja enthusiast and have done some reading on the subjects and this book is not of much use even as an introduction, in my opinion. I believe that there are much better works out there for a beginner. To start with Fall River Press needs a better editor to clear up inaccuracies like one I noticed in the timeline in the very beginning of the book. The book then proceeds to jump around from topic to topic, era to era, ""philosophy"" to concrete example, with no rhyme or reason. Any explanations given for terms or concepts are simplistic at best and confusing at worst. I wish I had not wasted my money on this book, shame on me for not looking inside when I first saw it at Borders. At least I paid less for it from Amazon Marketplace."
3,A good introductory text on the Samurai and Bushido.,"This book provides great basic information on various aspects of the life of the ancient Japanese Samurai. This text is beautifully illustrated with numerous color drawings. Each section is brief and concise, which makes it an excellent basic guide to Bushido (way of the warrior). Most of the information in this text is taken from Japanese classics such as Hagakuri, Book of five rings, Hojo Soun's 21 articles, and other sources. In conclusion, this is a book that will be of value to anyone who is intrested in some basic information on the life of the Samurai. However, those who want a more detailed historical perspective on this topic may want to conduct further research in Japanese history.Rating: 3 stars. Joseph J. Truncale (Author: Season of the Warrior: a poetic tribute to warriors)."
4,The picture on the cover says it all,"I was raised in a conservative household and consider myself conservative in many ways (though I'm a registered independent). That said, I am 29 years old and both these men were dead before I was even born. However I have had a fascination with JFK & RFK since I first started studying history and the impact that the changes in the 1960's would have on future America. The picture on the cover is very telling about how different these brothers were -- black and white. What this book is really about is how co-dependent these two men were, with Jack more so upon Bobby. Many disturbing facts have come out about the Kennedy brothers in the last twenty years. Much of it does bother me as a moral and religious person. But that doesn't erase the fact that Jack and Bobby were very intelligent and gifted men and when it is all said and done, their idealism and determination positively impacted our nation's history."
3,Interesting insights into the brothers' relationship,"I have a huge Kennedy library as I am fascinated by JFK, RFK and their times. This book offers some most interesting insights into their relationship. However, it is spoiled for me when the author bases so much on the tired and I think improbable Mafia connection to the JFK assassination (and indeed his election)."
3,Most of the material is not new news.,"I had hoped to learn something new about the brothers and instead read material that has been written in various other books. Having said that, if you've not read a lot about the brothers this is the book to enlighten you."
3,tedious at times,The book is Interesting as history but bogs down a bit ... good to read on a Kindle at the gym on a treadmill.
5,Kennedt Brothers,"Very informative, but leaves many questions unanswered. Have read many books on the Kennedys, but most do not answer the many question still around."
4,Great Record!,"What a shame! One of the best Australian bands. Animal comes out then they break up. As the other reviewer said this wasn't as rocking as previous Motorace albums.This album was promoted quite poorly by their record label. it has such a polished sound though. Standout tracks ""Want you"", ""The time, the place"", ""A little closer"", ""Not so blue"". Beautiful songs. World class sounding.Patrick Robertson's voice is superb and extremely mature on this album. I have a huge respect for the band for taking their music to another level. The lyrics are astonishingly deep and emotional.This should have been a massive album for them. I saw the final show in Melbourne, Australia. It was truly great. I recall them filming the show. Hopefully a DVD of it will be released one day.If you purchase this then also purchase Five star Laundry. It is quite possibly one of the best Australian rock albums ever created."
5,Goodbye Motor ace...,"The last album from the guys that brought you Shoot This and Five Star Laundry - definitely a new sound and album deserving an audience. Every song will grow on you, a little bit more mellow than their past releases. Favourite tracks include Not So Blue, The Time The Place, A Little Closer and the rather symbolic No Place To Go.All the best & Goodbye Motor AceGet this record or go to one of their farewell shows in december.Definitely a loss to the australian music industry..."
5,My favorite holiday book,This is a great book filled with awesome ideas! I love it and buy it for friends to create their own Christmas memories. The cookie recipes are the best.
5,square wonder,"This cd is truly wonderful. Square one knows how to deliver hard, pumping, exciting, throbbing dance music like no other!!!I am amazed that a dvd is not available of their live act as it really awesome. This cd and, in fact, everything they do is a must for Soca fans. Buy it, you will love it. Barbados - thanks."
3,jawbone,the company whom I purchased from was prompt and mailed missing parts immediately! Like all bluetooths its not perfect but the best I have owned!
3,Battery Man,"The product seems to function well and people on the receiving end comment on the voice clarity, but the ear pierce is not very comfortable and it feels like the device is always ready to fall out.Must be my ears!"
3,It's broken on the 3rd day!,"I would have given a 5-star for this product but due to design flaw where the charger is located. Due to this flaw, the plastic cap that covers the charger and the 2nd button broke during removal of the charger."
1,"If you like to mime, buy this bluetooth","This bluetooth worked all of 2 - 3 minutes. After talking on it for a couple of minutes, the person on the other end could not hear you anymore. It happened on every call. I finally had to return it. I will not be purchasing another Jawbone bluetooth."
2,Jawbone is a poor fit,"we purchased 2 of these items:One arrived broken, the stem is VERY sensitive, didn't make it in shipmentThe replacement arrived in record timeNeither of the Jawbones fit us properlyHigh priced item but low satisfaction.Wouldn't recommend it."
2,"poor sound quality, nice design","i really like the way this looks, it's more stylish than any other bluetooth headset (arguable no one else cares-- at least they tried?). it also has a lightweight feel and as other reviewers have said, almost unnoticeable. it does not feel flimsy or shoddily constructed though. the battery is sealed in, and will either require service to replace or completely discarding the headset.i paired this with my macbook pro. the sound quality was unacceptable, both for talking and listening. it would crackle quite a bit and drop out very frequently. it seemed to be of a working quality when i was within 2-3 feet, after that it degraded to unusable (not 10 meters as it claims)."
2,Not what I expected,"Read all the reviews- tried 3 bluetooths before this. First off, this is expensive- I was expecting perfection. Tried with 2 different phones. Doesnt hold a charge, is too heavy on your ear and people still tell me I sound muffled. Only thing good about it is the colors and the sound quality on my end. Not worth the money."
2,"Worked, but not for long","This headset had fairly good reviews and the technology seemed very innovative. The Noise Shield worked as advertised, nobody ever complained about background noise. However, after only having the headset for about a year and a half the quality and fit both started deteriorating. People often complain about not being able to hear me now, and sometimes the Jawbone just stops working altogether. Also, when new the headset would stay in place fairly well. Now it slides off my jaw (slips down my ear a little) often, which adds to the problem of people not being able to hear me. It is really quite sad that such an expensive headset would start aging in such little time.I've given up on Aliph and their Jawbone and ordered a Plantronics Voyager 510. We'll see if it lasts a little longer."
2,Not a good option,"Be careful. This product seems to be small, but it isn't. Also, all the included earbuds does not fit well to me. Seems like headset is out of my ear. Sometimes the song is too low, even when you keep volume higher. Don't try to talk with it when you face a wind (beach, for example)."
2,did not work,I was unable to have the caller hear me 75% of the time. I read the user manual and went to support on line. The only reason given was that the device was not making contact with my face. It was making contact. I returned the device.It also did not come with different sized ear buds or ear pieces as adveretised.
3,"When it works, the noise canceling is superb.","If you're looking for noise canceling headset, look at the Jawbone. But it comes with a caveat. The durability is questionable. I've gone through two first gen Jawbones in less then two years. The second one broke within the warranty period and it was replaced but that one broke too after several months of use. When I say ""broke"", I mean the noise canceling stopped working. The headset works but it's useless to me when there is no noise canceling. I bought a second gen Jawbone which is my fourth Jawbone and I am hoping it will last longer than my first gen ones. The only reason I keep buying Jawbone is because I have not found a better noise canceling headset."
1,Stay Away,"I bought this about a year ago and after using it a few times finally gave up. I bought it to replace my $29.95 Motorola BT headset and have regretted the waste of $90+ ever since. The quality is fine, no better than the much cheaper Moto headset, but the problem is it simply won't stay in my ear. It's wonderful they included several different ear pieces and ear clips, none make much difference as far as fit goes.It's also ridiculously hard to get in your ear and nearly impossible to find the answer button.All in all a dog of a product. Perhaps they should have saved the cost of having some fashionista designing the look and feel and instead invested a little of that cash in user studies or actual usability testing."
2,Terrible charger,Good bluetooth with a terrible charger design. My bluetooth broke on the 2nd day of usage while trying to take the charger out. It is like wrestling.. Will not recommend..
2,"Ok, but not built well","The Jawbone works okay when its fitted to your ear, but its not built well and will break off (the plastic ear part) Spend your money on something else!"
3,poor workmanship,"This is one of the best bluetooth headsets I've tried... the noise cancellation is fantastic and it allows other people to hear you clearly in a noisy environment (unless there's a lot of wind). It has very good battery life, albeit the battery is non-removable and the headset will become useless when the battery no longer holds any charge.The biggest fault is the earloop-- it's made of fragile, cheap plastic. They will break sooner or later, so be prepared."
4,"Love the product, not sure about the vendor","I love this jawbone. People say they can hear me so clearly they can't even tell I'm in a bluetooth. THis is the 4th one I've bought (for 4 different phones) and this vendor packaging was incomplete. They said it was new but it wasn't ina new box with all the ear pieces in tact. It just came in a plastic bag. If it was new, it was previuosly purchased and returned without proper packaging. It works fine though."
2,No great fan of Jawbone Bluetooth Headset,"I carefully researched this product before I bought it and experienced a big disappointment with this product. The volume is not there so that I could hear clearly. In additiob, it sometimes disconnects my calls, etc. Not worth the HYPE!!!!!"
5,Great headset.....,"Bought my son the iPhone the minute they came out and bought a couple of cheap bluetooth headsets for him, This is far the best out of the bunch....a amazing piece of technology."
4,"Great product, bad seller",The product works great but I wouldn't want to purchase from this seller again. It took almost a month after purchasing the product to finally recieve it.
1,It didn't work for me.,I tried the Jawbone and it's many ear attachments. The bottom line is it wouldn't stay inside my ear.
4,best i have tried but,"This unit sounds great and everyone can hear me without issue. I have tried other brands and people would always be saying ""what was that"" because they could not hear me in a car. I was talking while in a crowd to someone and they had no issues hearing me. The device connected with no issue to my t-mobile dash and allows full voice activated commands and dialing.Why 4 stars, 1. I do not like the propriety power cable to charge the unit with and the rubber cover that separates from the unit that covers the charging port. I applauded when most devices went to the small USB plug for charging and started to drop theses proprietary plugs thus you could use a generic car charger to charge them. 2nd I still have not found the proper fit it either hurts the back of my ear after a time, or falls out when working, this may be me though because to the benefit of the company they give several wearing options.Overall it works as advertised and the sound is impressive."
1,Sucks!,I would never recommend this product. Constantly drops bluetooth connection to the phone. Not worth the money at all. Save your money and buy something else.
4,Works well,"confortable, bought the jabbra ear gels, they don't stay on and are hard to fit into your ears. You don't need them.spearker is a bit tinny from the noise cancellation. Not very resitant to wind, works well otherwise.Good battery life."
1,Unreliable Performance,"To make a long story short, the sound quality on the Jawbone can be great when it works, but the one I received was completely unreliable. Callers would tell me I was coming through loud and clear, and then hang up a minute or two later because they couldn't make out a word I was saying. The line between clear communications and static appears to be very fine.You could get lucky and join those who rave about this product, or you could wind up as disappointed as the rest of us. Mine is now sharing a box with an RMA bound for the return center in Lexington, KY."
4,Very Good,"The Jawbone is a very good headset. It works well. I haven't had any problems with it.It doesn't fit as good as my old Plantronics 510 but once you get the idea on how to put it on your ear, its a non-issue.I'd recommend it."
1,Be Warned!!!!,"I too did a ton of research before buying the jawbone. The ear-loops DO NOT FIT!!! Period! The buds are painful and actually break apart. I was driving in the car and the headset fell off into my lap and the earbud was still stuck in my ear. That's when I knew I had to send it back. This was day 1 with the headset.Audio quality is horrible, despite what some reviews might claim. The noise cancellation is ok, but not perfect. The headset feels, looks and performs poorly. It looks like a kids plastic toy headset.I ordered a Plantronics 925 and the difference is amazing. Crystal clear audio on both sides.Be Warned!!!!"
1,terrible customer serice,"BEWARE: FANCY PACKAGE, POOR DESIGN, ""SCREW U"" CUSTOMER SERVICE WHEN DEVICE FAILS.don't buy this device, because the ""1 year warranty"" is carefuly designed to discourage actually providing a working device to the customer who has paid for the device.no response to the emails I sent for 2 weeks. phone service requires over a week to actually get another device, as well as a credit card charge before shipping.most honest companies that try to provide value will replace an under- warranty device that does not work. the apparent Aliph strategy of delay and charging diminishes the ""value"" of the product.agree with the numerous other posts that state customer service is very poor. you are better off not dealing with this company with bad attitude"
3,Conversation starter but...,"I love the look of the product and it works well enough not to return it, however it is almost imposible to get it to stay in my ear and does not block wind noise. My Plantronics headset works as well if not better and is more comfortable to wear"
3,Jawbone Experience,"While the sound quality was and all the instructions helped me understand how best to use this product, I ended up with two issues. The main issue was that it failed me only after a week, where I could not turn it on anymore. Simple problem, but this was the main reason why it became non-funtional. The second reason I had issues were that it could not clearly fit my ear - always being loose and slipping from the position where it needed to be. I believe it is a quality product, but I simply had challenges with this unit."
1,Jawbone Blue-tooth Head set,"Buyer beware!!Head set was very big and bulky in size, picture on Amazon is very deceiving. None of the four ear-pieces that came with it, fit my ear lobe and are very fragile, as some of the other reviews have stated. The ear-buds are a twist on type which are also very fragile, if they are not lined up to twist on, the rubber pieces will tear easily.Never even attempted to charge the device and try it out, I was so disappointed with the products' structure quality and how it never would fit to either ear.Waiting to return!!"
1,Broke right away,"About the third time I used it, I tried to pull the charger unit off the end, and it took the entire end off! It was like pulling an arm off an android, lotsa wires and stuff you really don't want to see. The bottom line is that the cheapass little plastic doohickeys that hold that end piece on are not as strong as the friction on the charger unit (which fits over the end quite tightly). Truly bad design."
2,"Not recommended - Despite great sound quality, fragile earloops break with alarming regularity","The sound quality is really very good, far better than the Jawbone 2. I did have the ear insert plastic break, requiring glueing. The thing that I despise about this headset is the earloops and how easily they break. You can bend them maybe a dozen times before they fatigue. Aliph has been pretty good about sending out free loops, but I am on my third pair of free ones. I just broke a new one after a week, and I was super careful to not bend it! I am going to ditch this and try the Blueant, as I am sick of handling this bluetooth headset with kid gloves."
3,Jawbone Headset for hearing problems,Since I have had a slight loss of hearing as I have gotten older (my left side being the worst) the Jawbone Headset is so far the best headset I have found for earpiece volumn. I can wear it in my left ear and still be able to hear my caller. I also appreciate the fact you get several earhooks and ear buds to help with the fitting since no one has the same size and shape of head.
3,Great headset until it breaks,"First - let me say this is the best bluetooth headset I have used. The noise cancelling really seems to work. Unfortunately, the construction of it is such that about 3 months into owning it, the earbud starts popping off. A little less than a year old and it's broken, because the repeated popping off has eventually broken the wiring connection. Too much to pay for something that breaks in a year. I think I'm actually going back to wired headsets; they're cheaper, and therefore endlessly more valuable to me."
5,perfect ear set,"very user friendly, fits perfectly, it comes with additional ear holders, to fit each and every ear!battery lasts long. looks good"
1,Not completly satisfied,Still trying figure out the bugs. Comfort for staying in ear and comunicating with other party very poor. Not at all what it was advertised to be maybe give it another week if it does not improve will return for a differant brand. Also this is my second one first one the mic did not work properly
1,Jawbone - Not a Good Buy.,"I purchased and returned one of these to from a retail store. I then ordered one from Amazon. I will say that the jawbone easily connected to my phone. However, people I called could hardly hear my voice. I also had to turn up the volume to one level below max to hear them. This left me with a headache because of the high sound level. I returned this one too. It is not worth what you have to pay for it."
2,Good electronics & design - poor construction,"I have my (red) jawbone for 7 weeks now. The sound quality is fine, but it is rather large and surprisingly heavy, it does not fit well and yes, two of my earloops broke off (at the same, weak point): a flawed construction.I bought the jawbone to replace my Plantronics 665, when I lost a few gel earbuds and thought I'd find something better. Now I have ordered new gels (for a fraction of the cost of new jawbone earloops), and will replace my new jawbone with the older Plantronics, whose design, size and accessories suddenly look pretty awesome :-)P.S. I bought my jawbone from a large internet electronics shop, but aliph does not honor the warranty since it is not ""an authorized reseller"" .."
2,Agreed. Good technology but horrible fit,"I have to admit most of my co-workers like this headset, so I was optimistic when I bought it. I've owned several Bluetooth (2 different Motorolas, 2 different Jabras, and the Treo) and sound quality versus fit often seems to be a tradeoff. Same story here: good sound but bad fit.This does seem to have better sound quality if you place your hand over the headset and hold it into your ear. The headset will stay for a minute or two and then pop out. If I'm driving and put on glasses it will not stay in ear at all. I've tried both ears (2 loops are included for each ear) and all 4 inserts. I wish someone made the fit and on/off ease of the Motorola 850, but the quality of the Jawbone."
1,Horrible quality control,"I have just received my third defective Jawbone headset from Amazon. The first worked great for two days then refused to take a charge. Amazon shipped me a replacement. This one worked great for one day until the microphone died in the middle of a call. All attempts to get it working again failed. Just now I opened the next replacement to find it in pieces in the box--the back cover was off and the circuitry was exposed. That couldn't be fixed either. I just got off the phone with a customer service agent in India who issued a refund but could do nothing more. I have owned a half a dozen bluetooth headsets over the past few years and had ordered this one to replace a workhorse Plantronics 510 that finally wore out. During the brief time the Jawbone worked, the noise reduction was amazing. The problem is that their quality control is simply embarrasing. I'm going to order another Plantronics 510."
3,"too bulky,not comfortable at all,noise shield?i don't thing so.please be careraful befor you buy.","I have alot of problem with this one:noise shield,echo,bulky,not fix in my ear at all,some day i will try a new jawbone,for now with this proplems not for me."
4,Aliph Jawbone Noise shield Reducer,"The new Jawbone is a very good noise reduction hands free device. The plusses are that it is well made, and the battery charge holds for a good amount of time. Outside noise is kept to a minimum to those you are conversing with. The minuses are that it can be difficult to put on and comfortably keep it in place. Seems like I'm always adjusting it so that it fits properly around my ear and to find and hold the best position for volume. That being said, this is a very good device that I have and would recommend."
5,Awesome!!,"I love this seller!! Product was delivered as described (new) and on time (actually, ahead of schedule.)"
4,The best blue tooth,This the 4th jawbone I have purchased. Once anyone uses the jawbone everything else is 2nd best
5,good product,"I ordered this for my husband,who drives a dump truck. He has been very satisfied with it's reception and ease of use."
3,jawbone,The unit worked very well at first but the microphone failed after only a few days of use. After getting the run around for weeks concerning a replacement I gave up and returned the defective unit to Amazon and ordered another one directly from Aliph. I am currently waiting for the replacement to arrive.
3,Jawbone Bluetooth,"Received my Aliph Jawbone Noise Shield Bluetooth Headset. Received in brand new condition as I hoped. I like it, I just wish I could increase the volume coming in more. I've been told the clarity on the other end is good."
4,Just what I want,"I have used a few bluetooth headsets before including a couple that are more expensive than Jawbone. This one has the best noise cancellation technology, which is the reason I bought it in the fist place since I use it a lot while driving. The other parties on the line are all impressed with my new bluetooth headset's improvement.I worried about how it fit on my ear after I read other people's review but, to my surprise, it fits very well on my ear. I have used it for several months and nothing is broken yet. However, I lost it last week and now I am going to buy a replacement. :(I agree with other people that it does not do very well on wind cancellation but, again, I doubt any bluetooth headset can do much better. Also, the conversation sounds muffed on the receiving side but I have no complaint since it is much better than without the noise cancellation. My only complaint is the charger. I wish they have a more generic one like a USB charger. :-)"
3,"good headset, bad ear loop","the headset itself is pretty rugged, however the ear loop is quite flimsy. while it fits over the ear snugly without pinching or being uncomfortable, it tends to break easily, right at the point where the loop attaches to the headset. although the product ships with a number of replacement loops, it is a pain to force the broken piece out and attach the new one.sound quality is good, it is definitely not the smallest headset out there. would be nice if the device sported a mini-usb interface instead of a proprietary jack, so that there is one less cable/adapter to carry around."
1,"A horrible company, they take your money and the product just looks good.","I had the unfortunate of buying of these products because I thought it must be good if everyone else does.What a mistake. When I called the company, they said it is beyond the warranty and I was out of luck. I had bought the product a while back and it had been stock in the suit case while I traveled. Literally brand new and I had to through it out.I highly recommend you NEVER buy it. I wasted my money. I hope you don't do the same mistake!"
1,Poor mechanical design & sound quality,"I bought this device based on the reviews of the noise supression ability. Two big flaws from this device. One, the sound quality was so poor that I could not understand the person on the other end. It sounded like a cross between talking in a large, echoing bathroom and a fuzz distortion filter. Two, the mechanical design of the ear loop sucks. It easily breaks and does not flex at all.I had a couple of Motorola headsets which I lost but love the ear loop design for it was made of flexible plastic and I could move and flip it around and not worry about breaking it unlike the Jawbone. What I also loved about the Motorola devices was that I always knew when I turned it on or off from the audio feedback. With the Jawbone, the indicator is the light which I had to take it off my ear, turn on and off to figure out which state it was in.From now on I will get Motorola for a better human, mechanical, and electronic-acoustic design."
1,Jawbone gets tons of hype but in real world aplications falls way short,"I have tried a few Bluetooths now, and this unit may have the best noise cancellation out of the pack but who could find out? The fit is so poor it kept falling off even after trying all the different ear loops & gels. I tested it in NYC it's 1st week. My callers could hear me until I started to walk and then all they heard was wind. It fell out of my ear so much I bought and tried an ear gel from another manufacture but the units weight made it untenable. by the 2nd week the ear hook that fit best broke and no stores in NY seem to carry replacements. Well this week I bought a Blueant J9i so far it blows the jawbone away not even close. Stay away from the hype and the Jawbone it's a waste of money"
1,Don't waste your money,"My husband bought this headset for me at my request for Christmas. I immediately had issues with fit. I tried all the different ear loops and ear buds but couldn't find one that fit well. The ear bud seemed to push the headset away from my face and then it would eventually fall off from the weight of the headset. If the headset isn't resting against your face or ""jawbone"", then the person on the other end can't hear your voice very well. I am now looking for a different headset since this one is completely useless to me."
1,"No, no, no!","I have heard that the Jawbone was good, but in my opinion it was not all that. The volume was not as loud as I expected and it was not a snug fit."
1,Awful,"I would not recommend this bluetooth. It is bulky, the ear pieces hurt the ear and it has to fit tight or people do not hear you. It keeps going out on me where people cannot hear me and I cannot hear them. I was really disappointed."
1,Noise cancellation a no-show,"Bought this from amazon after reading all the hype. I had just previously tried the Blueant Z9 and been disappointed (it didn't cancel noise - in fact produced phantom noise of its own to the listener.)I was really hoping the Jawbone would be the killer noise reducing BT headset, but it's not cancelling noise either. And yes - I have the nub touching my cheek. My wife said she could hear all the noise in the background clearly, so I had her use it and sure enough - I could hear everything.Maybe I got a dud, but I'm so weary of trying to find a good noise cancelling BT headset that I'm not in the mood to try a replacement - it's going back pronto. Back to the wired theBoom headset for me!"
4,Jawbone,"The Aliph Jawbone is one of the best headset I have owned so far.It is a little hard to get on your ear sometimes.The ear loop is the only problem but it is easly worked around.The sound quality is great, and the noise canceling is incredble.You can talk with all different kinds of noise around you and the person on the other end will only hear a little, if anything.Once you learn how to get it over your ear you will be happy you got one."
4,best bluetooth headset,I like it ...very light ..and it fit very wellthe sound quality also good and the battery stand for a long time
1,Should have listen to prior reviews.,Not at all happy with this product. I just lost out on $79 plus tax is what it all sums up to. Does not work!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!What noise shield??????? The feedback was just awful!
2,Not for everyphone,"It doesn't seem to hold a connection with my Blackberry Curve. The fit has been fine, and the sound is good when working with my voice dialing. The act of connecting to an actual call disconnects it every time, incoming or outgoing calls. So the spouse scores the new headset and I'm back shopping."
1,"Poorly made, flimsy","My fault for not having read the reviews first. The top charging piece broke a fastening tab the first time I plugged it into the charger, and the (very uncomfortable) ear wire broke after one day.I returned it for a refund. You can do much better than this product and for a lower price, IMO."
4,The Jawbone,Very nice product. It helped eliminate noises as promised. The only thing that I have a problem with is fitting it to my ear. Some more specific fitting informstion in the owners manual would be helpful. Without this info you will spend a lot of time searching for the best combination of ear pieces and ear buds.
3,"Great Technology, Only If I could Fit it in my Ear!!!!","I purchased this unit from Amazon for my new iPhone. I have to admit that it's an amazing piece of technology. Noise cancelling worked flawlessly, and people could hear me clearly, but I had some difficulty hearing others. The major problem: I couldn't fit it right in my ear! I tried all the possible combinations of earbuds and earloop, but I couldnot find the perfect fit. And this problem defies the purpose for 2 reasons: (1) It stays loose on the ear, which is ugly and uncomfortable; (2)It prevents the sensor from being in touch with your face all the time which is the main point of this device! Also it is bigger than what I expected and buttons are designed very lousy and difficult to press. I am returnig it and going back to my old motorola. I hope they have fixed those issues in the new Jawbone."
2,DOA,"I know many people love this product, but mine was near dead on arrival. The microphone works 10% of the time. It is the most annoying thing imaginable. I am not even bothering to try and return the item to the manufacturer, as I have heard already that they do not honor their 1 year warranty unless the purchase was made through their website. I guess I would recommend this product, but only if bought from a retailer was a good return policy."
4,Aliph Jawbone Bluetooth,Excellent sound quality. It is a big bang for your buck. Lasts for a long time without charging. Nothing to complain about.
3,Way Overrated,I can't hear conversations and others can't hear me when I am in my convertible. I have heard nothing but great things about the Jawbone and I feel that I wasted my money. I was pleased with Amazon.com.
2,"Great press, very disappointed","I bought the Jawbone based on a number of positive reviews - cnet.com, amazon reviews, etc. I have been thoroughly disappointed. Re. sound quality, the supposed noise cancellation is a joke. While I can hear everyone fine, most of my friends refuse to speak with me if I am using the headset. Durability also is an issue, in at least two ways. One, the headset comes with different ear clips, which is good because they break. Two, the charger has a nasty habit of pulling part of the headset's covering off when removed.On the positive side, when I contacted the manufacturer they were very good about sending a replacement unit, and even including extra ear clips at no cost. However, the sound quality for those I am on the phone with remains horrible."
3,Great headset but doesn't fit well in the ear,"I think the sound quality both outgoing and incoming is awesome, much better than what I had before with or without any headset. However I did have trouble fitting this thing in my ear. I had to try all their different combinations and I found one that was better than the rest, but still not ideal. I guess if there was a way for me to try it before I bought it, I might have had second thoughts about buying this."
1,Oooooops,I bought this thing about 5 or 6 weeks agao and I opened the drawer where I keep it yesterday morning and it was broken. I have no idea what happened. Is there such a thing as leprechauns?
2,Fell apart...,"Had this headset for one week. Sound was very good but the fit was terrible. It actually made my ear ache if I kept it in for too long. After about 3 days, I noticed that the rubber housing around the ear piece was gone and the headset was suddenly a very, very loose fit..as in it would fall off if I tilted my head. I should have known. The rubber earpiece cover fell off the headset when I opened the package. One week in and I unplugged it from the proprietary pinned charger (ya, forget about using the chargers you already have) and the whole thing came apart in my hand. So, now I have a charger with half of the jawbone lodged in it and I'm, once again, looking for a solid, quality Bluetooth headset. Frustrating, to say the least. I'm almost tempted to go back to the old school wired earpiece!"
2,sound is horrible,[Good]Decent battery life.Decent looksFits somewhat comfortably[Bad]You'll sound great to the person you're speaking with. Unfortunately you won't be able to hear the person that you called.Not worth the price
1,Jawbone,"This headset is bulky, and the sound is not clear. The button is hard to push, which makes it painful to your ear. I do not recommend."
1,It did not work.,"Once I received the product, it only came with left earpieces, I'm right handed. Then I connected it to the phone and to test it out, I could hear them but they couldn't hear me. I returned it & waiting for a FULL refund. Will purchase a jawbone elsewhere."
1,it dont fit and you cant force it!!!!!!,"Aliph Jawbone Noise Shield Bluetooth Headset- BlackIt seems to work ok, but I can't keep it in my ear, I dont normally review products, but the bad design on this forced me to do so."
2,Beware,"Proper fitment very hard, i purchased ear jells with it and still had a hard time. Everyone i spoke with on this headset had nothing but complaints with static, and said i sounded muffled and had a very hard understanding me. My side sounded pretty good, but had to keep volume at max. I was using it with a Verizon GZ one so that possibly was an issue don't know if anyone else has had this problem."
4,Decent little headset,"I bought this as hopefully a better alternative to the Motorola headset. It stays on my ear better (but it takes a minute to get it on your ear so hard to put it on while a call is coming in). In most situations its blocks out most of the noise, but some renegade sounds come through. Overall, a great product, good deal (compared with other sites)."
1,"Breaks easily. My mom's, my friend's and mine broke. Too bad, great sound quality.","This seemed to be the best headset ever. It had the most crystal clear sound I have found in a bluetooth. But it broke and so did my mom's and my friend's. My mom and my friend went and exchanged it for the new jawbone, but the sound quality on that is horrible, no one can even here them. Too bad, it was a great product except the flaw."
2,"Good sound, poor mechanics",I have had the Jawbone for about six months. The sound quality is very good and I have not had trouble with disconnects or with the charger. The mechanics are not so hot. The switch placement is so poor that I just don't use it to answer the phone or hang up. The ear hooks are also very poorly designed. I have broken two of them so far. The lack of ambidextrous capability is a problem. You have to carry two hooks and swap them out to switch ears.
2,"Stylish, but unsatisfying","The headset has all the style it promised. The sound was good without being great. I found it difficult to use:1. Despite for different ear holders, it never became stable2. The ear piece kept falling out (and getting lost) which make it uncomfortable and less stable in the ear3. It appears that it's draining battery unless you explicitly turns it off. I kept finding that it wasn't ready.I've returned to my default choice of Plantronics."
2,Ear loop a disaster,Broke two ear loops in 48 hours. Sound is great but I cannot keep up with the flimsy ear loops. Cheaper to sacrifice quality and get something else.
3,"Doesn't fit, ear adapter breaks but decent sound","If only I wanted to hold it to my ear, it would be fine - as the sound clarity is very good.However, it never seemed to fit and I eventually broke every one of the ear adapters that it came with in trying to adjust them. (I'm actually glad to hear that this happened to others, not just me, as I was starting to wonder if something was wrong with my ear shape).I regret spending the $$ on it, and can't personally recommend it."
3,Could be more comfortable,I wanted a bluetooth that I could use while driving. I like that I can hear who I am talking to and they can hear me. The only problem I can find with the ear piece is that it is not as comfortable as I had hoped. The bluetooth came with several different over the ear pieces and figuring out how to get the ear piece on was very frustrating. Once I figured it out I can now put in on pretty easy but getting to that point was very frustraing. I like that it doesn't fall off which was a problem that I saw repeatedly on other rewies for similar product.
2,Disappointed!,The good news - the background noise suppression works. It is good for the people on the other end of the call. Otherwise I found the Jawbone to be a disappointment. Getting it to connect with my Palm Treo frequently takes several attempts. The earpiece is uncomfortable and awkward to put on and off.
1,"Two Strikes, You're Out!","I received my Jawbone and anxiously opened it and charged it. When it was fully charged I tried to use it. I was able to hear the other caller clearly, but they could not hear me at all. I sent it back for another. The next one would shut down by itself after a second or two."
1,Returned after two days,This product did not work well at all. Others could not hear me and what they did hear was static.
2,Terrible Quality Control,"I gave the product 2 stars simply because of it's reputation. The actual product I received was defective, TWICE! The first headset arrived with the back button broken off. The second headset sent to replace the first would not charge. In electronics, I don't follow the 3-strike rule. If you produce a product that shows up broken twice, you have let the consumer down. Take this review as you will. I simply wish I had received a working product to give an accurate review on..."
1,Bluetooth connection problems,I have no idea how well this device works since it refused to connect to my HTC P4000. If you go to the Jawbone website and read through the FAQ's carfully you will see that they don't support connections to MAC or Windows based PC's (that was the response I got from their technical support as well). So if you have a phone/PDA running Windows Mobile then the Jawbone unit likely won't connect up to it.
1,Stay away from this item - buy a newer model,"I purchased two of these headsets for my wife and I, and neither item worked for more than two weeks. The charger ripped the tail piece off of my wife's headset, and my Jawbone stopped transmitting my voice. I have coworkers who love their Jawbone, but they have a newer version. This version is deep discounted because it is worthless."
3,Aliph Jawbone,"Bought 2, sound and quality of device excellent, The wire for the device that hold on ears is very poor and breaks very easily. Had to order replacement parts the first week. Would be outstanding device if the wire hold would be corrected."
3,Good ... finally,The first two units I got were defective. I could receive but not transmit. The customer service was good. I spent a couple hours with technicians trying to work the problems but had no luck. The third unit works as advertised. It took a while but I do like the Jawbone. Reception and transmission are very clear and the noise cancellation works very well
2,Definitely Shop Around,"I did extensive research on the best headsets before I decided to spend my money... From Motorola, to Plantronics and finally to Jawbone. While it did have noise guard it was not to great for ear comfort nor sound quality... I even returned my 1st Jawbone because it was having some sound issues (very bad interference). They did send me another one (after a $100 hold was placed on my credit card until the return of the defective headset). When I received the new Jawbone, same problems different headset. The ear comfort was the biggest issue for me because it hurt. Sound was to low with the volume turned all the way up...I returned this headset and got the Motorola H12 and have been happy ever since..."
2,"Great sound quality, poor construction","I was very impressed with the sound quality of my Jawbone, but, as other reviewers have noted, the contruction quality is poor. I used the device for about three months before the earpiece separated from the main housing, and went through at least three earloops during that time. When a ruggedized version comes out, I'll be back on the customer list."
3,"OK, I guess","I have used it for 2 weeks, in general it works ok. However, I am not satisfied with the battery life and noise level is more that I expected."
2,Not what it appeared to be!,"Watched a commercial from jawbone and fell in love with the aliph but when I received it and tried it out, it fell short of expectations. With the windows down and the radio on the person on the other end said it sounded like I was in a tin can. Also, when the dj started talking that came over loud and clear to the person on the other end."
2,The jawbone does not work with a beard,"This head set does not work if you have a beard. I had to return it. I did not like the clip that goes over your ear---very, very cheesey."
2,"Decent sound, horrible fit","After using the Jawbone for several months all I can say is I completely regret ever buying it. The sound quality is good, but nothing particularly special either despite all of their claims. The sound quality is a bit better than my previous $50 Motorola bluetooth headset.The main problem with the Jawbone, as many others have said, is the terrible fit. I typically wear the Jawbone for both legs of a 30 minute commute to work and at least half the time the Jawbone begins falling out of my ear requiring constant adjustment. When talking I usually have to hold the Jawbone into my ear with one hand so it works properly. Kinda defeats the purpose of a wireless headset.I've tried various combinations of the included earpieces and ear loops with no luck in finding a good fit.Not recommended."
2,overall-- a terrible headset,"I have been using BT headsets for years and it is important that my clients can hear me well. Of course, I heard that the Jawbone was the very best. The reason I give it 2 stars instead of 1 is because it did provide good sound quality. Definitely above average. Not amazing, but certainly good. But not good enough to make up for the flimsiest, cheapest, most breakable, buggiest device I ever owned. I have gone through 4 since mid-summer. Each one is crappier than the previous. They break or stop working. Of course you can order duplicate cheap parts, but needs it. I am done with this waste of money device."
3,Good device - good earloop fit - bad earloop metal,"I have a first-run Jawbone, and I like it very much: lightweight, compact, handsome, etc. But what is the story with the metal they used to make the earloops? They fit quite well, once you've (carefully) nudged the metal into the shape that works best, staying away from the connection to the unit. But the metal is not very malleable, and thin at the connection to the unit: sooner or later the stem breaks right at the connection to the set. I am very careful with my stuff: no tight pockets, no bottom of the briefcase, but I have now gone through 8 earloops. And now they are no longer making the loops for the 1st edition Jawbones. After proving that I actually bought it, and when, they will send me one loop. That should last for about 4 weeks. Does the new model have a better stem design?"
1,EXTREMELY Poor Quality,"Judging from the advertisements, I received this product expecting great things - superior noise cancellation, comfortable fit, clear sound, etc. I cannot provide feedback on any of these features, because the earloop broke within 30 minutes of trying it on. Jawbone Customer Service has failed to provide a replacement part. While I wait, and wait, the little rubber strip that covers the charge ports has fallen off and dissapeared. This is a very poorly made product. I am buying a Plantronics."
5,jawbone,"I ordered this bluetooth headset for my husband who is in and out of vehicles all day. We needed something that was good outdoors. This piece was easy to match to the phone and use. After 30 days of use, he has had no issues."
2,Jittery Jawbone,"I recently purchased a Jawbone as a gift. It arrived poorly packaged and without instructions. The small recharging port cover was damaged. When I called the vendor, he could not help me and referred me to the original company. It's been six weeks and we've not received the promised replacement yet. The moral of this story is to buy from a store, in person, looking the product in the eye."
2,Not for anyone.,"This thing is HUGE!!! Too big, unless you are going to a star trek convention. Sounds good, but the Blue Ant is better."
3,to big,"It's a little bigger then I thought, the ear piece dosn't sit in your ear all that well. Over all though good"
2,Review for Aliph Jawbine Noise Shield Bluetooth Headset,The earpiece didn't fit my ear as I thought it would. Very big and I wanted something a bit smaller.
2,Good outgoing voice onl,"Outgoing voice quality and noise reduction is good. But not much use if it not fit comfortably on your ear and also no great sound to you. I also have cracking sound, while party on other end of phone conversation really enjoy good sound. Better if both of us can enjoy it."
3,"Decent, almost worth the money","The headset is ok, but to me it's not really worth it. This headset was to replace my Motorola H700 which had better sound quality although it is quieter than the Jawbone.The Jawbone looks great, but is a bit on the large side for a headset. The Noise Shield works very well, but sometimes you'll sound muffled to the person on the other end. The sound for the user is decent. The volume is good, but the quality is much worse than any Motorola headset I've used. But my biggest gripe with this headset is the fit. I don't like wearing it with the ear loop and none of the earbuds fit well. I find myself having to readjust it regularly.Overall, it's pretty good, but for the price, it's almost worth it. It does exactly what I bought it for, but if I could find a better fitting earbud I'd be very pleased. So far I haven't had any problems with it other than fit and if it were cheaper I'd probably give it four stars."
2,Does not fit the ear,I bought the jawbone for my wife for Xmas got a great deal for it at $69.99 but got a few weeks later. It did not fit my wife's or my ear and then another co-worker of my wife's tried it and he had no luck either. This is the only draw back that I noticed even with all the ear pieces that they have.Dee
2,"low quality, not made to last","This product worked great the first day I had it, then it broke in 2 places while trying to remove the charger from the unit.I am a commercial truck driver and cannot talk without a handsfree headset in my rig legally after 1-08. I am still waiting for a replacement even though the company is located 1 hour from me."
3,It was okay...,The ear pieces kept breaking. other than that everything was okay. Sound quality was good. I am in the market for a new blue tooth and I would look to a new one before buying this one again. But if you find this item at a good price (under $50)definitely buy it.
1,Keeps falling apart,It works just OK. I can't get the volume up loud enough to hear in noisy background areas like airports or a city street. The custom fit ear cups keep falling off. I would not recommend.
1,poor,When I got the jawbone it was already broken . I have been trying to get the number so that I can speak to someone about returning it. for my money back or a new one . thank you .
2,Ear loop are flimsy--replacemetn loops not properly sent,Sound quality is good and once you get use to it the fit is comfortable. The earloops are flimsy and break VERY EASILY. I ordered two 4 packs of additional earloops (8 earloops in total) for $20.00. I received two pacages with one earloop in each. Two emails to customer service have gone unanswered so far.
3,good audio but flimsy build quality,"Bought this in late November... from an audio perspective, it works well. People hearing me on the other end reported excellent sound quality, no issues there. Sometimes I wish I could make the audio louder but that minor detriment was not a deal breaker for me. Also, despite the multiple loop and earpiece options (loops for left and right ear), I never felt it was completely secure while I was wearing it. Was looking forward to the day I'd lose it. So why am I disappointed with it? This thing completely fell apart.. the part that goes in the ear literally snapped apart, would not reattach. Didn't drop it, had it less then 2 weeks. Returning it, now resuming search for something more durable..."
3,Cannot replace charger,"Good headset with clear sounds and good noise canceling. The only problem is the charger as it is not universal, but custom to Jawbone. One of the pins in my charger broke 2 months after I bought it and you cannot buy one separately, so now my Jawbone is useless."
1,Do Not Buy!,"This is probably the most over-hyped headset! It is horrible! Not even worth the free shipping! For starters it only charges about 1/3 of the time. Even if it charges over night and led changes color to fully charged, you go to use it in the car, and looses charge in about 5 min. Additionally, I find myself holding it in my ear just hear the other person - this with the volume all the way up. Most of the time the person I'm talking to can't hear me. I end up taking it off and just holding the phone up to my ear. REALLY a poorly made device!"
2,Overrated,"I had the Jawbone for a week before returning it. Despite good sound quality, the unit had very limited range and was extremely uncomfortable despite a myriad of ear pieces and hooks. Likewise, the buttons, which are hidden, aren't the easiest to use and when taken with the poor fit and range make me wonder if there's something better at the price-point."
5,"Minor flaws, but overall it works great.","I read all the reviews before I bought this (about a month ago), and after seeing how many people had problem with the earpieces that are included, I went ahead and bought the Jabra Eargels at the same time. As luck would have it, one of the hard little earpieces that came with the Jawbone fits my ear perfectly, so I wasted $10 on the Eargels. Oh well.The little rubbery strip that covers the charging connection has fallen off somewhere, and was probably eaten by my cat. That's okay, I didn't really need it anyway.I find the Jawbone extremely comfortable, and can wear it all day without it bothering me. I was actually surprised by how well I can hear other people, even with background noise, and no one appears to have any difficulty hearing me, even when there is background noise on my end.All in all, I would buy this product again, and I would recommend it to my family. That's about as good as you can get, right?"
4,Not as good as the Pricetag for me,"I read the reviews for the Jawbone Bluetooth headset and thought that it would be a good unit as I spend alot of time outside and I wanted the noise cancelling feature for the wind. I have tried several times to activate the noise cancelling feature to block out the wind with no luck. Also, my ears do not fit the ear loops very well and after a few hours, the unit becomes uncomfortable. I know this is only a discomfort because of the shape of my ears. Finally, I guess that I was more impressed with my old Voyager 510 with noise cancelling stone mic for half the price."
4,So far it's not too bad,"I ordered this product simply because of the Noise Shield. Today has been the first day of use on this product and it really isn't that bad. I must say that the sound is good. I have had no issues with the voices sounding muffled or robotic at all. However, fit is where I have a slight issue. I can get the headset to fit, but it isn't as comfortable as my Plantronics. I did take another reviewer's advice and ordered the Jabra eargels. I should have them tomorrow and certainly hope that the fit is a little better. Overall, I'm pleased with my purchase and am glad that I decided on the Jawbone."
1,"Bad fit, worse noise reduction",Not a good headset. I bought it with high hopes based on what they advertise on their website. They show a weedwacker right behind the guy on the phone. I use it in both modes and people can hear every sound in the background. My Plantronics Bluetooth was much better than this. I can't believe I paid so much for it. Jawbone must have recognized the issue too since they say their new model is better at reducing background noise. Wouldn't believe it.
2,A disapointment,"I've had the device for several weeks now. It's not exactly easy to operate. There are two buttons under one piece of plastic, and it's hard to press either of them specifically, or know which one you press, especially while wearing the device. People on the other end of the line haven't been able to detect any difference in background noise between just using the phone and using the Jawbone."
2,NO REPAIR AVAILABLE OUT OF WARRANTY,"NO OUT-OF-WARRANTY REPAIR AVAILABLE FOR JAWBONE. Because of the expense of this item, you would think a repair center for out-of-warranty repair would exist. My jawbone fell into water which nullifies the warranty. Requesting help through customer support repeatedly referred me to the warranty policy (which is not a help) and finally to the fact that no out-of-warranty repair exists. I liked the Jawbone's noise canceling feature, which outweighed the difficulty with fitting, the small plastic part which was lost with 24 hours and the difficulty removing from the charger. If I had realized that it could never be repaired past the 1-yr warranty, I would not have purchased this product."
4,it's ok,I bought this because of all the good reviews. I really don't see a diffrence from any other blue tooth. I thought it took the sound ofwind when you have the window down but it doesn't. I'm still learning it but I can't say it's the best one I ever had.
4,Almost perfect,"One of the best at noise cancelling. Only complaint is the ear piece doesn't fit as well as some of the others and therefore you don't hear as crisply as you might like.Otherwise though, its pretty darn good."
2,"Terrible quality, poor design. Peformance ok (I think)","After a few weeks, the back of the device broke off in the charge, exposing the circuit board and preventing from charging. I super glued it back on and covered the glue mess with black marker.I ran into someone at work and asked him about his. Sure enough, he had the exact same problem (even used a marker to cover the glue marks).The other day, I drop it on the ground (not an uncommon occurrence for bluetooth headsets) and the metal ear loop snap off!This thing is a piece of junk. Even if it never broke, it's difficult to carry in a pocket due to the big ear loop. Also difficult to put on.I'd recommend avoiding this product."
1,Poor Fit,"Using all earpieces, left or right, this thing will not stay on my ear. It's fine if I sit still but can not move at all or it flies off. The sound and tap features are great, but I used it only once due to poor fit.Replaced with Motorola handsfree speaker that clips on the visor."
5,great product,This is a great product. It was a little bigger than I expected but it fits very comfortably. It comes with several different ear pieces that help fit the bluetooth to your ear perfectly. The sound is crisp and clear. Sounds great on both ends.
2,NOT WORKING WELL,THIS PRODUCT IS NOT WORKING WELL FOR ME IT CAME APART ON THE FIRST DAY I GOT IT NOW NO ONE CAN HEAR ME SO I GUESS IT IS MY LOST
1,Didn't work.,The bluetooth didn't work with my phone and it was a pain to return. Not as easy as just returning to Amazon.
3,Ok,"It is ok. Very compact with good battery life. Doesn't stay in ear as well as I would like to. Kind of wish it had a loop to go over the ear. I have to speak pretty loud for others to hear me. Voice quality is pretty good. I like the carrying case, small and compact. Nice variety of ear pieces included."
5,great earpiece,bluetooth earpiece is great. the only noise anyone can hear on the other end is wind.
1,Didn't even make it out of the parking lot.,"After reading a lot of reviews, I thought I'd give the Jawbone a try. My Motorola H850 is ready to give up the ghost and I was ready for a headset with a little higher audio quality. One that I could actually use while driving. I was a little worried about the previous reviews on the way the Jawbone fit your ear but I thought I would give it a try just the same. I purchased the unit and took it out to my car in the parking lot. I spent an hour trying to get this thing to stay on or in my ear. After trying every possible combination of ear buds and ear hooks, I packed everything back up and went back into the store and returned it. I could not get it to fit at all, it seemed cheap and flimsy and definitely not worth the 129.00 price tag."
3,"Decent sound quality, but must be touching your cheek","The Jawbone does sound good, and works in noisy environments (except wind noise). By wind noise, I mean you will hear noise (and I suspect the other party) if the Jawbone is exposed to wind, (walking outside on a windy day). Driving with the car windows open is not a problem. I did not try the Jabra eargel enhancement. The stock solution with the earloop does not always provide reliable contact to my cheek. (This is critical to make you sound clear).I have two other complaints.1) The Jawbone does not fit well in a pocket, especially with the ear loop.2) The developers should have used a mini USB power port, instead of a proprietary connector. This hasn't really been a problem, as the battery life has never been a problem. But, it means another charger.I would buy it again if mine broke, as the sound (both ways) is very good.The buttons are a little too slick, but they do work."
1,"It does not work at all, sorry!","1. It links with my bluetooth equipped cell phone fine.2. It's noise shield technology cuts off regular conversation voice.3. When the noise shield is turned on, the regular conversation can hardly be heard over the other side.4. The noise shield is default ON until your call is connected and answered, then you can turn it OFF.5. Before you can turn off the noise shield, the person on the other side can hardly hear you. Your voice comes on and off irregularily.6. Their warranty and service department also refused to exchange my unit."
3,Okay product,"This bluetooth is just okay for me but not worth the money paid. It's a little staticky when you are only just a few feet away from the phone and you hear a popping sound as if you are about to be electrocuted. The fit is definately off. You cannot fit the earpiece around your ear and the other one in your ear at the same time unless you bend the one that goes around your ear. If you bend the one that goes around your ear, you risk the chance of bending it to the point where it hurts when it's on your ear and then you can't wear it for a long period of time. You also need to use both hands just to get it on your ear.The good thing about this product is, It's a heck of a lot better than the Motorola H-thingamajig."
2,If you have a MOTO Q - don't buy it,"I bought this bluetooth and was so excited about getting it. Then, I found out it wouldn't work with my Moto Q even though the specs say it will. Apparently I'm not the only one to experience this problem, I found out later on the internet. So, if you have a MOTO Q, don't buy it. My boyfriend loves it so he now has a new bluetooth. AH WELL."
3,Jawbone review,"I'm a little disappointed with this. The volume seems to be a problem - I am having trouble hearing with it, even when I turn the volume up. I also have a problem turning it off and on. It's hard to tell when I've effectively pressed the button. Of course, if I hear the beep I know it worked, but sometimes with a ""really good press"", nothing! On the plus side, the sound clarity is very good, when I hear it. I will stay with it for now, but it better get better!"
1,Complaints when ever used!,"Sorry to say, I thought I was getting the Cadillac of a Blue Tooth, and it turns out to be a lemon. Everyone complains that they either get an echo or feedback, they can never hear me clearly - - that I sound muffled or distant, to the point that it's not even worth the bother to turn it on. I have to be sitting in one spot, holding the phone up to my mouth, or all I get is complaints from everyone. And blue tooth to blue tooth, forget it! Reception is terrible. Also, I have the same problem as others - the Jawbone falls out of your ear and moves around. Then everyone says ""you keep fading in and out . . . what's wrong with your phone?"" I waited to buy my 3rd Blue Tooth thinking that the industry has had enough time to perfect the product. Since I drive alot for my job and need a ""hands free"" device, I will go back to the old fashioned headset that no one could ever tell the difference whether I was hands free or not!"
3,"Good product, big flaw","The reviews on this product sum it up pretty fairly. It is very good performing headset. THE BIG FLAW, which really impacts its usability, is that the earbuds fall off with the slightest touch. It is extremely difficult to keep from losing them. The best fix is to go directly to jawbone's website, where they are 9.95 with free shipping. This problem really detracts from its usability and the manufacturer needs to address it."
2,Jawbone bluetooth,"I am dissatisfied with this product because of the flimsy ear gripper. This metallic? curved piece that fits over the ear does not hold the device tight enough next to the ear. The noise reduction technology seems to work but there is a clipped sound at the beginning of each new sound that it encounters. So if there are many new sounds that it encounters, the person that you are talking to will hear many clipped sounds. I have a Plantronics that I will continue to use more than this item"
1,Great Looking - just don't try and use it....,"My Fiance accuses me of over-statement, so I'll tone this one down...""The Aliph Jawbone is the crappiest piece of junk I have ever paid money for..""How's that, honey?"
5,Best headset I have ever owned,"have owned them all... Plantronics, Motorola, Jabra, you name it... this is the best headset I have owned. Noise reduction is great!"
3,Wait and see,"I love the design and features of this product. The manufacturing leaves much to be desired. My first unit had a defective base that let the earbud easily fall off. This was not good. The second unit wouldn't charge. The third unit would only charge when I changed the angle of the charging cover. These types of problems are unacceptable with a product that has outstanding, and best in class features."
2,Broked after 5 weeks,"Everything I read about the Jawbone made me believe this was going to be something special. Unfortunately, it's really quite average. The receiver said I constantly had an echo, though I could hear them fine.Unfortunately, one day without warning the receiver could no longer hear me. Complete silence on their end. I returned the Jawbone and now have the Plantronics 665 but that has a crackling sound whenever anyone speaks.At this rate I may just go back to a corded headset!"
4,Very comfortable,"Just got it yesterday so I can't speak to longevity, but it's the most comfortable bluetooth headset I've ever worn. It is a little hard to push the on-button, but I think that will be a matter of practice. And it's BEAUTIFUL!"
4,Stylish but not perfect,"Jawbone works well, sound quality is good to excellent, and the device looks great. It's a bit hard to get comfortable on the ear, and the internal buttons take some getting used to."
1,Uselessbone,"I had heard good things about this and my wife works at Best Buy, they just got them in and got a good price on it due to employee discount. I am extremely disappointed in this headset and I am returning it tomorrow. Not only is it uncomfortable to wear, but almost any movement of my head causes it to slide out of my ear and hang by the hook. I tried multiple combinations of the different earpieces and hooks that it comes with and none of them worked. Fancy noise-canceling and sound quality are useless when the headset wont stay in the ear."
3,Earbud is horrible but the technology is excellent,"I love the technology on this product, works great. However, the ear buds given with this product are awful, they work for about 24hrs then the ""stickem"" fades off and you can't keep this bluetooth in your ear more than 10 min at best. I did read the other reviews and got the mini-gels in the mail today, much better now."
2,it broke a week after using it.,I had to contact the company about it. IT broke the ear piece from the base a week after getting it. Upon calling the company I was informed that this product is no longer being made and that it is only in red and silver now. And do I want to upgrade to a more expensive model of this piece. It is also costing me money to send it back to them and receive another one. SO NOT WORTH IT. I still do not have the earpiece.
1,This headset was NOT NEW,"I was sold a used headset.It was dusty and was missing parts.At very best maybe it was a display, but still not expectable."
1,worthless junk,"I bought this based on some coworkers opinions that it worked great. Well after over a year of use, it doesn't work as advertised. It doesn't cancel out any noise and people I'm talking to can't hear me that well.The earloops are pure junk. I broke all that came with the set. Now I can't even buy replacements unless I buy direct from China. They break so easily even after I learned the proper way to put it on and take it off my ear.I wish I could return it, but after such a long time, I don't think I can.It seems that nobody can make a good noise cancelling bluetooth that fits my needs. I can't use the headphone type like my truck driver friends use since they are too large and in my opinion, in the way. Besides they cost two to three times more.The hunt goes on for the ideal bluetooth. I doubt I will ever find it."
1,Disappointed,I ordered a new one & received an used one. It cost me $7+ nonrefundable postage to ship back the used one. Never have a chance to use the product. Very unpleasant on-line transaction. I will not buy anything on-line in the future.
2,hard to get a good fit,"The over-the-ear piece is a not a good fit for my ears. Moreover, they are extremely fragile and prone to breaking. Within 5 minutes of getting the phone out of the box, I broke the ear piece just trying to get the headset over my ear. I put the headset in my piece and bent the second piece. The plastic piece covering the control buttons seemed very cheap also, and I think it would be a matter of time before that broke as well. I generally take good care of my headsets and electronic equipment, so if the headset seemed fragile to me, it probably will for most. Also, as a woman with a small head, the headset just felt clumsy and big. On the upside, the acoustics seemed decent, but then I only used the headset once and decided to return it."
2,Over Rated... Acceptable but mid-tier BT at best,"I bought the Jawbone a couple months ago with great anticipation, after reading all the hype about military grade noise reduction. So far, I am disappointed. Battery life is so-so. Odd choice of proprietary battery charger connector. But the biggest issue is the sound quality, on both ends. My trusty old Plantronics 510 may not be as pretty, but the sound quality, battery life, etc. is wayyyyy better than the Jawbone. I just picked up the new Plantronics 520, and it too is a far better alternative vs. the Jawbone."
1,"caviar price, tin-can sound","I had no problem getting this to fit correctly and my hopes were high because of the buzz surrounding the product. I had it all ready, paired, etc. Then I called my voicemail and I could feel the disappointment hit me. This has to have the tinniest sound I have ever heard. I have a $20 Jabra that sounds better than the jawbone. Such a shame that this is not ready for prime time (at least as far as this model is concerned)."
2,Doesn't live up to the hype,"I got this based on great reviews, and having had poor feedback from a Motorola 850 I had. I wanted to just go for ""the best"". Well, it looks great, but doesn't work at all if there is the slightest wind or breeze. People just can't hear me real well. The earpiece never seems to feel the same way twice, or even at best, never feels like it's on securely. The sound on my end is not that great, either, though I'm willing to trade that off if my caller says it sounds ok. Which they do. If you're in a quiet space, or in your car, they say they don't hear background noise. And, finally the fragile nature of it means it not easy to just put in your pocket or whatever if you take it off. You really have to either ""place it"" or put it someplace where it won't get crushed. It could be a little hardier, and the earpiece a little more positive, in my opinion."
2,Expensive and useless,"Since it was the most expensive headset available, I thought, OK, this is going to be good. The sales person assured me that it was the best of the best.Ouch! The noise cancellation system is actually really good, but everything else can be trashed. The piece is heavy, feels like junk, keeps on falling and hard to keep on your hear for extended period of time. The sound is just OK, not phenomenal. There are a few features that I liked such as the automatic volume adjustment, the army graded noise cancellation, but I still returned mine 10 days after purchase.I bought the new Plantronics and I am a lot happier, although not completely wowed."
2,WOW not in a good way,"Well I like many have owned many different headsets. The noise canceling on this one works for me just like advertised, I turned on a shop vac for a test called my wife tried it with the noise canceling on and off. She could not believe the difference could hardly hear the vac at all. Now as far as the fit this has to be one of the most uncomfortable headsets I have ever owned. I drive a diesel pickup and can not hear because the dang thing will not stay in my ear. Kind of defeats the purpose to hold it in place might as well just use the phone. The charging plug that fits on the headset is really snug and is hard to remove. I can see after a few months of using it something is going to give.The phone store I bought it at said they have never had any returned well they are about to; I am waiting for my Plantronics 510 to arrive today."
4,Not like the youtube video,"Clear sound, good fit, noise-cancellation doesn't seem to work the best at times. Still better than anything else I have used."
2,Jawbone Bluetoooth,This product works ok in quiet environments but I can't recommend it for use in loud ones. The noise cancellation works as good as the cheaper bluetoooths I have had but overall I was not impressed.
4,great headset,"The jawbone is great in terms of noise canceling and audio quality, just a little bulky and the earpiece causes it to hang looser than i wanted."
3,Good quality..but,the quality is outstanding..probably the best I've ever had..but the quality of the little thing that wraps around your ear is very cheesey and cheap. I am on my third one as the first two broke. I would definitely recommend this product in terms of sound quality and it works well with my HTC Mogul
3,Jawbone,"This product requires you to carry yet another recharger...it has a different connection from say a Blackberry, etc. Sound quality not as good as advertised."
3,AVERAGE,"THE WAY THIS PRODUCT BOASTS ABOUT HOW WELL IT WORKS, I EXPECTED MORE. MOST PEOPLE I SPEAK TO SAY IT SOUNDS LIKE I'M A COMPUTER WHEN I USE IT. RATING IS AVERAGE, NO BETTER THAN ANYTHING ELSE ON THE MARKET."
3,Jawbone ok with some adjustments . . .,"I concur with other reviewers that the Jawbone functionality is ok, while the earloops and bits that fit into the ear are not great.I read somewhere that you could use a Jabra earjel, and have had some success with this. I stuck it on with that sticky putty stuff you can get at office supply places to put posters up with, and so far, so good.I just have to make sure that the putty, which does not cure or harden, has not migrated into the little channel that the sound travels through. When things start to get muffled, I have found that a toothpick or other similar object quickly makes sure that the channel is clear.As for sound, try speaking VERY softly. This seems to produce the best voice reproduction on the other end in my experience."
2,Bad Fit,I have heard many positive reviews of this headset so I was very excited when I finally got a phone with bluetooth. Their main claim to fame is their sound quality and it kind of lives up to that expectation. The one thing where it falls extremely short is in the fit. No matter what I do this headset always feels like it's going to fall off of my ear. I can't seem to get a snug fit and because of this not only is it uncomfortable but it also effects the noise cancellation feature. I wish I would have returned this headset when i had the chance but now it sits mostly unused until I forget just how annoying it is.
1,"Best out there, but no replacement earloops available","No complaints about the earpiece, I've bought several for my company. But if you break the earloop (and you will ventually), you'll have an unusable unit because the Jawbone folks have decided to discontinue the replacement item. Be warned: the earloop for the new Jawbone II WILL NOT WORK with this original unit."
2,Chinese whispers,"The two stars are for Jawbone's packaging and sleek product design.The missing stars are for performance. A friend and I bought the Jawbone together, and both of us are seriously under-whelmed by its ""military grade noise shield technology"". No wonder armies shoot themselves in the foot.And no, despite the changeable earbuds, neither of us have been able to get a comfortable fit. The loop is so designed that you'll have to keep it in-ear; not very easy to reach for and quickly plug into your ear to answer a call.I won't be buying another one soon."
4,Warranty,I just called Aliph and they do warranty their products no matter where they were purchased. (Maybe this other reviewer is working for a rival headset manufacturer?)
3,Where's the quality?,"This is the second one I have purchased because of the noise canceling which works great. I am dissapointed in the quality, on the first one the piece that holds the earbud fell off in less than 2 months. The second the charger doesn't work anymore I have had it 3 months for this price it should last a while!!! I payed $140 for the first and $100 for the second."
2,HAS AWESOME POTENTIAL BUT....,I purchased 2 of these in November for my husband and I.. I think the shound quality is EXCELLENT! BUT there is too many problems with them:1. The earloops are constantly breaking! We have gone thru 7 of them so far.2. My husbands end cap constantly comes off when he carefully pulls it off of the charger3. It really is not all that comfortable. I really do not like the caps that snap on and go on your ear I find them all super uncomfortable! I had been using the one that was on my jabra (which is still the most comfortable headset) but I have to be very careful because that could fall off at any time!If they could figure out how to better this product they could make a super amazing headset!
2,not as good as I expected,The devise has a few shortcomings. I find it difficult to put on my ear and uncomfortable to wear after a few hours. I do not understand the differences between the different ear hoops. It could use a sound director in the ear. I think it needs something that pushes the sound into the ear instead of just to the entry to the ear canal. The reason for this is the reduced volume of the phone instructions as compared to conversation and the difficulty to hear conversation in a noisy atmosphere which the devise was marketed for. It does meet 80% of my expectations of use in the outdoors but I would not buy another one.
4,Excellent bluetooth,This blue tooth is an excellent product. It does take a while to fit the proper size ear piece and holder to one's ear. Otherwise the sound is awesome and having a noisy vehicle no longer matters during conversations!
1,Maddening at best,"Could not resist the great price, but that is the only upside so far. In use the volume is never loud enough for noisy environments. The headset is constantly being dropped from the handset making it impossible to know whether to answer a call from the headset or the handset. After multiple emails to Aliph they finally admit that it is a know problem on some handsets and there are no plans to resolve it. I am the proud owner of a shiny new pile of e-waste."
1,Jawbone Headset,I'm not sure why this headset has gotten such rave reviews. It does not hold it's charge. Is difficult to keep in sync with my blackberry pearl phone. Has static issues if it is more than 3 ft from the phone. And I find it difficult to hear people if I am anywhere other than a quiet room.
5,This is by far the best Jawbone I have (including ERA and ICON),"I bought the original Jawbone headset in 2007. It is still the best bluetooth headset for audio quality, on both ends.It is quite a bit bigger and heavier than the other two Jawbone headsets I own, the ICON and the ERA, which everyone complains that they can't hear me (although I hear them fine). I bought the newer Jawbone because I like to listen to podcasts when not on a call and both supported A2DP and the ERA proported ""hd audio quality"".I also discovered that the earpieces from the ICON and ERA also fit the older Jawbone perfectly and I don't have to use that silly ear clip (which is uncomfortable after a while). Much better.I think I will go back to this headset for a while - the voice quality is great, the noise cancelling is also great, I can hear perfectly and its built like a tank. I may even buy another as a spare."
3,No the right product,The product was in perfect form and I have no complaints. I selected the wrong item but it wasn't anyone's fault but my own.The return process was speedy and perfect. I was very impressed with this seller.
3,Be VERY careful with the ear loop!,"The ear loop on this jawbone is fragile. You MUST exercise caution when putting it on the first time especially. It just seems way too fragile for such a quality Bluetooth device. Mine broke - fortunately, the store let me replace it with a new one - but i didn't like having to do that in the first place."
5,swedish chef,This headset has been working flawlessly for two years. Sound is still great. Has the original battery. I must admit I don't get many calls.
2,Too painful to wear,"While the quality of the sound is great, the fit is far from it. The ear loop is painful after awhile and then it breaks. None of the ear buds ever truly fit to my ear so I ended up holding the jawbone to my ear with my hand 80% of the time. I had to buy a whole kit just to get the new ear loop. Now I've just stopped wearing it. I would not recommend this product."
3,Just ok but not for the price.,"I recently purchased the Jawbone headset and my first reaction to it is that it no better than the most average headsets I can find. Here are a couple of things I didn't really like but could put up with, its heavy and it doesn't sit right in my ear no matter how configured. I also found that people did not hear me really well and that I could not hear them all that well either. I have adjusted it several times for background noise but just found that the one I have just isn't as great as I was expecting. After about a week it wouldn't take a charge anymore so I sent it back. Hopefully it was just altogether defective and the replacement works better."
1,Unhappy with the product,The bluetooth headset docking with the charger broke within a month. The buttons for on and off are bad. Its a waste of money. Don't buy this.
1,Only left one star because it wouldn't let me leave none.,"What a disappointment! Cheaply made. No one could understand me. Incoming audio was difficult to understand. It kept beeping several different patterns every 20 to 30 seconds. Customer service had no idea what this was, why it was doing it or how to stop it. Although they send several different sizes of earplugs and ear holders, I couldn't find one that was comfortable or that would stay on my ear. This was the 4th or 5th headset I have tried and I just about gave up until I ran across the Motorola H710. It does it all well and I don't even know I'm wearing it. Sorry Jawbone. I just don't understand all of the glowing reviews."
2,Jawbone Classic,"This is my third Jawbone - the first one did not work consistently and the second one I ran over with my car - it was working okay when it met its untimely demise. My current Jawbone has been inconsistent from the moment I got it - I can always hear the other party, but frequently they cannot hear me. After approximately one month the transmit side of it does not work at all. I tried the new version and it did not work for me at all. Again, no consistent transmissions. There has to be a better head set out there."
4,great but could be epic,"This thing is sturdy and made with very thick high quality steel, the only thing i didn't like about it was its short height which makes doing pull ups pretty difficult for me but that issue might be great for some people with limited height requirements, and the fact the holes weren't numbered but that's a minor inconvenience. I was also missing some ""washers"" in the packaging which annoyed me but you can grab some of those from any hardware store. Other than that this thing is a beast and i definitively recommend it to anyone looking for a power rack."
4,A good McKee Sampler,"I have been a fan of McKee's since her days with Lone Justice, in fact since I first heard ""Ways to Be Wicked"". I have enjoyed her music since then but just wish she'd do more.It's hard to review a Greatest Hits collection. If you are a Maria McKee fan you will really like this CD but you will find yourself pining for more and wishing that she were more active musically. Personally I would love to see her get together with Lone Justice again and reunite - isn't everyone else?If you are a little familiar with Maria McKee, it probably would be better for you to listen to her work with Lone Justice so that you cna get a full appreciation of her talents."
1,The only book I have ever put in the recycling bin,Normally I would pass a book along to another reader. In this case I couldn't bring myself to do that to anyone. The paper content is best off recycled in someone's paperstone counter top or as bedding for horses. I found it insulting at best and self-contradictory at worst. Its cult-like rhetoric makes it fairly obvious why this book is the foundation for organizations like Brahma Kumaris. Avoid. If you're looking for some spiritual insight do yourself a favor and pick up a J. Krisnamurti book instead (like Freedom from the Known).
5,Raja-Yoga a western mind can understand,Vivekananda does a brilliant job of bringing the principles of Raja-Yoga together and translating them such that the western mind and access and understand this branch of Yoga and his particular approach.
5,THE ONLY BOOK OF ITS KIND,"Swami vivekanand had given dictations for this book to miss waldo(swami haridasi) more than hundred years back. Over the period of time many good books have come up regarding above subject matter but none can be compared with swamiji's this very small book, as this is a book which is result of communication of swamiji with his own self."
4,Diversity described by who knows,"This work matches with my thesis, describing diversity in all aspects along a gradient of space and time. It's a great review of some theories and thoughts."
3,Non-Gator grip,"I purchased the 12 pack of gator grip picks (purple), but mine have no grip to them, as a matter of fact, they are very slick. They grip better if I moisten my fingers."
4,Pretty good!,Really nice item! The picks are nice in firm in you hand when you play and can't really even break em! They are defiantly worth the money these are my new favorite picks to use! The one problem is they only come in the color purple. Other than that BUY THESE PICKS!
3,gift,These were purchased for my grandkids for a gift to go along with their guitars I purchased them for Christmas.
4,Picks are all one color - not a variety.,"Picks are probably fine (I'm not experienced enough on guitar to offer a solid opinion), but the photo is incorrect. I thought I would be getting a variety of colors, but this thickness is kind of a dull purple color. Just note you will get all 12 of the same color."
3,"""The First Songs""","The cover of T21's masterpiece, ""Million Lights"" has a picture of a toddler holding himself up in a doorway. That cover would have been apt for this album, a collection of 2 early works by Trisomie 21. Here, they seem to have had an idea of what they wanted to do, but were too inexperienced to put it into play. The production isn't nearly as polished as on later works, and the songs themselves are somehwat simplistic. You can hear snatches of what they would become, but this isn't the best place to start your T21 collection."
4,This book gives so many perspectives on childfree-ness!,"This was a second book I read on the topic, and while the first time I was looking for something more objective, this time I wanted to know the arguments for staying childfree. This book didn't dissapoint, it contains interviews with many people around the world, each with their own story. There are interviews with people who don't have kids and love it, who had kids but wouldn't if they could go back in time, and finally people who had kids and enjoyed it (although these are the minority). I found this structure of the book, with plenty of insights from others, very helpful as it helped me to realise that there are so many like-minded people around the world!"
4,picked up a lot after a slow start,"This started off slowly, so much so that I set it aside and read some other books, but I picked it back up and read the rest of it in a couple of days. Very honest insights from parents and non-parents."
3,"A little confused, but an ok read nonetheless.","The author wavers a bit from complaining that working mothers are under-valued to complaining that working parents get more benfits, like not being expected to work late shifts and such. There does seem to be a little too much ""baby-bashing"" and portrayal of ""child-burdened"" mothers as having a miserable existence. I don't think that's entirely objective, I'm sure that there are parents out there who enjoy their children's existence. Aside from the slight confusion and the slightly un-necessary bashing, it's an ok book that brings up the alternative way of looking at the mommy question."
5,THE Favorite of my Favorite Bath Ice Cream Fizzy,"I love all the Bath Ice Cream Fizzies...but Lemon Verbena is my absolute favorite. A very light, lemony scent...nothing heavy...it's perfect for summer. Makes me want to reach for a favorite white sundress. This scent just IS summer! And the light moisturizing oil that it puts on your skin makes your tan positively glow!"
4,Nice follow-up,"Great book & a continuation of the story begun in The Snow Queen.This is a character-driven book with not a lot of action. If you're looking for space adventure - look elsewhere. Having said that, the last third of this book is so suspenseful that I almost missed my stop because I was reading it on BART & got engrossed.Lots of levels and lots of layers. Ms. Vinge really loves her story and her characters and obviously had a great deal of fun creating all the different worlds and political wheels upon wheels. It was fun to visit other worlds and see what else was out there in her universe, but I think I loved most of all the bits and pieces of the people of Tiamat roaming around their planet amidst the Hegemony's rubble.Interesting, engrossing, and emotionally engaging - this whole series is great."
2,One word: boring,"Snow Queen was magnificent!Tangle Up in Blue was a solid sequel.The Summer Queen falls flat.It is long, slow, dull, uninspired, and seemingly directionless with well-known characters who no longer evoke empathy in the reader. Skip it unless you need a doorstop."
3,The summer queen,"I have read the Snow Queen as well as the Summer Queen, and I really liked both of them. The Snow Queen did more for me, however, because it had more an air of innocence about the characters in it than the Summer Queen did. I was somewhat disappointed in the rolls of the characters, here, especially Sparks. However, this book did well at carrying on the story."
5,Makes Meditation More Enjoyable,"Diana Lang's Meditation book and CD helped me anchor my meditation practice so powerfully that it makes me look forward to sitting every morning and enjoying her delicious voice guiding me to other realms. Meditation is so important and I thank Ms. Lang for helping to make it easier for me. I have bought several copies and given as gifts to friends who are also thrilled.Opening to Meditation: A Gentle, Guided Approach (Book & CD)"
5,"Diana Lang's ""Opening to Meditation"" is a blessing!","Diana Lang's approach to meditation has an ease and beauty about it that is inspiring and makes meditation completely accessible for all. The Book/CD is an incredible tool for anyone who is new to meditation or has been meditating for years. The meditations are perfect to start or end your day with. I use this CD every day. And every time I listen to it, I discover something new. ""Opening to Meditation"" will open up a whole new world for you."
2,"no cd/mp3 included, dissapointing kindle edition","there is little sense in buying this book for the kindle, since the cd is essential. nevertheless its a good and brief instruction. amazon should consider to give kindle customers the oportunity to download the cd otherwise ten bugs for a 4 dozen pages feels like a ripoff."
5,Become aware of yourself and stay there for awhile...,"How simple is that?! Meditation is not some mysterious, hard to reach location...rather it is simply a matter of opening your mind to the possibility of calmness and love. Diana's book is terrific for beginners who may fear that there is more to meditation than simply accepting yourself, deeply and completely. My favorite quote: ""The breath is the bridge between the self and the soul..."" Gentle, guided, steps to help you on the path. Lovely!"
2,Woman's voice ruined it,"The book is pretty and well written; however, the woman's voice on the CD is so irritating to me that I can't use it. There's no use trying to meditate when you're blood pressure is rising. Others may not have this problem."
5,Your Guide...,"to the magnificent museum! I have never been there, but this book is the next best thing. With sculptures and painting in black and white and 60 in beautiful color. This is your guide to the Louvre! If you're too far from Paris, just grab this book, it ROCKS!"
2,Makes car dirtier than before.,"I sprayed this directly on my tires as the instructions state for the best shine....waited 3+ minutes for it to dry and drove off. The material did not dry completely and the tires spun the tire gel all over the quarter panels and doors and it is extremely difficult to get off...what a pain ! Additionally, the spray got all over the wheels, too, and then collected all of the brake dust making the tires ridiculously dirty !! I'm trying to make the care look nice...not add to my clean up and work. Did I mention how hard it is to remove ?? I had to use, literally, about 10 x the normal soap I would use to wash my car and had to empty and make a second batch ofsoapy water. NEVER again will I use this product."
5,Post-it quality.,"This post-it tabs are awesome! Doubtless this design is one of my preffered. They're very usefull, are in 3 great colors and are thick and hard to break."
5,Perfect,"Love these tabs!PROS:- Thick and sturdy! They feel very sturdy and you can't tear them if you were to throw a book covered in these in a bookbag.- Nice colors. Not too bright and pen marks show up great.- Can unstick and restick with great success.CONS:- Hard to write on. I find my sharpie pens are really the only thing that can write and don't smear. But even with my sharpie pens, I have to wait a few minutes and let these dry or they will smear the ink across the tab."
1,safety hazard !!,"I recently rented this item from a rental store. It is the most awkward thing to use. You have to release the hand brake and step on the platform for the engine to tighten the drive belt which places the operator right under the load going up the roof!! Without going into detail about my experience with this machine, it is a safety hazard and an accident waiting to happen!!"
1,Clever Idea but Should Have Test Marketing the Concept,"As a Senior Issues and Crisis Manager at the third largest Public Relations company in New York City, I am always looking for creative approaches to solve business problems and promote a harmonious workplace. I stumbled across this clever and colorful book in a book stores and after reading a few pages of the clear and intelligent writing style I was sold!I decided to implement several of these the author's strategies, and my associates did not take to the idea too well. Some laughed at me, and others found the whole process of looking at 78-cards to be too confusing.Honestly, I was shocked that such an interesting approach was not well received in New York City and at a Public Relations firm.But, I would like to just warn all of you in the corporate world that as fascinating as this approach is in theory, the author should have test marketing it first, because it turned out not be workable in practice."
2,Right.,"This book, while novel in it's premise, it is just simply not practical for a corporate setting. The author seems bent on a crusade to ""legitimize"" tarot as a brainstorming and business tool; what he fails to recognize is that the use of the cards themselves may conflict with the religious beliefs of certain employees. In today's litigious corporate world, it's just not that easily explained away.It also speaks volumes when an author posts to the customer review section here with his own site URL, then debates reviews word-by-word at his personal site."
1,lots of issues,I bought it because of the price but had to return it.pros: price is cheap(paid $279)cons:battery life. most NH batteries won't power it.very hard to use manual lens
5,Awesome Camera,"The Pentax K100D is compatible with all Pentax lenses. That is huge! If you are a previous Pentax owner, you can keep what you have. But even if you aren't, why purchase a camera from someone you know will probably be changing camera mounts in the future. I got the Pentax K100D for Christmas and I love it. This camera feels like a real camera should. It is responsive and fast. I recently shot photos at my niece's Quinceanera. I shot over 300 shots and 99.9% were first-rate. I had no out of focus or blurry shots and no shots that were delayed due to shutter lag. I used 2 CRV3 batteries and had no problems with battery life. Shots with flash and without flash came out great! Thanks Pentax for this gem of a camera."
5,Pentax Revisited,This is a wonderful camera. I have the 35mm ME Super with a selection of additional lenses. The best feature for me is the backwards compatibility for all of my lenses. They work perfectly except for the fact they are not auot-focus. Not what I wanted anyway. I moved up from a Kodak point and shoot. The end result ...an excellent level of picture quality the Kodak will never attain. The features are comparable to that of Nikon and Canon at a fraction of the cost. I don't see the need to pay for those names. I use the diffence in cost to help me justify buying another lense.
2,"Here today, gone tomorrow","This camera has an awesome image stabilization feature, and I have been very impressed by most of the features; good color fidelity, great in low light etc. And it's cheap. However, recently the camera stopped recognizing the battery. Sent it to Pentax who can repair it (new circuit board) for $250, which in my view is not worth it. Things happen to technology, but I'm wondering if this is a weakness with the brand as I have never experienced such a glitch."
4,Good deal,"For the price and what you get this is a good deal. It feels good in the hands ( that makes a big difference on an SLR), has a big LCD screen, has a good MP (10 Megapixels doesn't necessarily get you better images and the humbug of dealing with those large files may end up being a disadvantage). It still has issues with low light but has compensation features to deal with it. Get the hi-power NiMeHyd batteries and a charger and 1 GB card. The batteries last a long time and if you set your pictures to an acceptable 4MP you can shoot all day. It's light so you can shoot one-handed if needed.I haven tused many of the features but the ones I have worked well. I'm glad I chose this over the Cannon and Nikon, for all of those reasons mentioned above."
3,Milquetoast,"Wonderbread. This is thrilling music that, if well played and conducted sends shivers down your spine. This banal interpretation shows no artistry, no edges, no nothing. Neville the Metronome isn't up to the task. I'd love to hear him conduct this today, because I'll bet it's 1,000 percent better (he impressed a few years back when he was in town guest conducting for the MN Orchestra's 100th anniversary). The 1983 version is ""not ready for prime time."" Merits a 2 rating for performance, 4 rating for sound, for an overall 3."
2,VERY Harmful,I bought this after having Parvo in my home.I tried to cancel the order which could not be done and then once receiving it and reading how harmful it was I donated it to my local Shelter.
3,Case,Case seems ok but like the metal cases much better. Band saw fits in case well and has spare blade storage.
5,East Prussian American Looks Back and Forward,"My great grandmother came from near Danzig. Her name was Tarnowski, and obviously had Slavic origins. Her husband, a Proesch from Mecklenburg, was a descendant of the Slavic Abotrite tribes (ca. 800). They both considered themselves German. This book explained to me the ethic confusion of areas like Poland/Prussia. It also highlighted a fact that history has witnessed with Poland: You can wipe it off the map politically, but a Polish/Prussian sensibility will remain. What can this mean for the future? I believe Prussia is, indeed, not dead. Also, that WWIII is not neccesarily the inevitible result of such a conflict. Is the extinction of Prussia another Versailles-like offense to the German people, or can accommodation be made to deflate this ""ethnic"" horror? I welcome response."
3,dashmat,"I ordered this mat for my sons truck, accidentially ordering the wrong color. The company was excellent and quick in the exchange process. I recieved the correct color in just a week later, wrapped it up for Christmas. It did not fit his vehicle, even though they have a drop down to choose year model, etc. It still was way to big for his dash. The material the black mat was made from a nice velour, the exchange grey mat was thin carpet. All in all it was alot of trouble with still no mat that fits."
4,Humorous light tale that is laugh out loud witty,A great read if you are looking for something light to read. The author weaves the trying tests of motherhood into this story; her humorous perspective on situations all mothers have encountered will make you laugh out loud!As a reader you may miss many nuances if you are not a mother or have not spent a significant amount of time around children. But if you know what it's like to care for an infant and attempt to maintain your sanity....you will love this book!
4,I agree about the poor reprinting but the book itself is fun,"I enjoyed the book as I enjoy all of Thirkell's books that I can find. I am happy that Moyer Bell is reprinting them regularly - I believe one is due this spring. I don't like the Carroll & Graff reprints either because the typeset is so sloppy and blurred, it is annoying.I have always thought that Thirkell's books are great books to read on the beach, in the plane or on other occasions when you want something entertaining, light and funny. If you can't stand the silly inanity of authors like Danielle Steele, Rosamund Pilcher or Mary Higgins Clark but you want something light and entertaining to read, Thirkell is your man. (Or woman, I should say.)"
1,Don't waste your money,This towel is horrible and don't waste your money. It does not absorb at all. I bought two for a trip and they are worthless. They are now going into the garbage. Don't wast your time or money.
5,A Steal for the Money!,"PROS:Soft, very comfortableVery Low DistortionLong CordNatural Sound Quality, No Fake BassPlays very loud!Very AffordableGreat for ALL uses. High End Audio, FLAC, Super Audio CD, TV, And Computer Use!CONS:Everyone in my house can hear them because of the Open Air DesignThe fit is a little too loose for smaller headsAfter previously owning other Brands , I found the Audio Technica to be The BEST in their price range; actually, I could not find better until paying over $300. I was very surprised that they were Remarkably Better than the GRADO SR60, SR80, AND the 125's! These also did not have that fake boomy Bass that I find in the BOSE! The Audio Technica Have a TRUE and NATURAL Sound! In the future I may add a Professional Headphone Amplifier. If I would ever replace these Headphones, I would have to pay over $1,200 for an UpGrade!"
5,Great for the price,"I liked a lot these cans. I'm mainly a classical music/opera fan, and I'm very satisfied with the Audio Technica. They have a wide soundstage (a must for Mahler or Wagner, the kind of stuff I hear), and the sound is pretty natural."
3,Super comfortable and good sounding BUT mine made a wierd ringing buzzing noise...,"I bought these and they were very comfortable and cool, they sounded great but MY pair (maybe it was just mine) made a weird ringing/buzzing noise when certain low frequencies were playing it was HORRIBLE so I returned them."
4,The most comfortable headphones I've ever owned,"After owning numerous pairs of Koss and Sennheiser headphones these are the most comfortable by a mile. The sound is extremely good in the mids and highs, but lacks a little in the bottom end. But this was overcome with some equalizer adjustments to tweak the bass a little. I can recommend these to anyone like myself that finds headphones fatiguing after an hour or two, as this is not the case with the AD700's."
4,Nice Headphone,"I can listen to this Can non-stop for more than an hour without ear fatigue, something to be considered a plus.Very very comfortable and it seems it can fit any head!Vocals seem to almost hit the same naturalness of hi-end headfi, with good highs extension and nice soundstage.Not that tight bass, does not possess the deepness I'm yearning but good enough for its price range.Since I cannot bring Grado RS1i anywhere, this will suffice as an alternative."
1,"Pumpkin-head, Large, unadjustable, good sound","They sound as good as my old headphones, I'm quite satisfied with that. I'm not enough of an audio expert to give a definitive judgment on the sound. Unfortunately, they fit so poorly I find them unusable, and plan to return them. Like about 10% of the other reviewers, they're too big for me. There's NO adjustment. Unless you have a head like a Pumpkin, forget it. There's a mechanism of levers and springs that is intended to auto-adjust these, I think variations in the spring tension account for some of these fitting better than others, but that is pure speculation. Although very similar in appearance, the closed-backAudio Technica ATH-A700 Headphonesdon't seem get the complaints about ill-fit that these do. They might be a better choice."
5,AW HELL NAH BIG PIMPIN,YO JONES THESE HEADPHONES IS GHETTO FLY PURPLE PIMPIN I PB DROPPED THES SCRUBLETTES OFF A DOUBLE SHURA MASSIVE AND YO JONES i WAS ROCKIN THESE BOMB BEAT BLASTIN SHOCK ROCKERS SHAWTIE DONT PASS UP A DEAL THIS BLAZIN HOT GODDAMN FIRE ASS TRENDSETTAH DOPE ~SWAG~ DEAL
4,good,"Good headphones, absolutely no bass, amazing mid-high. The purple/pink mesh is very bendable to if you hit it it will dent. I recommend getting ATH-M50's instead.Copy and paste: http://www.amazon.com/Audio-Technica-ATH-M50-Professional-Monitor-Headphones/dp/B000ULAP4U/ref=sr_1_1?ie=UTF8&qid;=1356995309&sr;=8-1&keywords;=ath+m50"
3,Warning about fitting,"Two warnings for those who would consider these headphones:The non superficial complaint:1. They have no vertical articulation -- you cannot adjust the distance between the two phones. I have a reasonably large head (wear a large to extra large motorcycle helmet), so i would have expected this to not be a problem for me, but it was. I found the bottom of the can would push against my jaw/lower ear, while the top would flare out from my head.The superficial complaint:2. They are way more pink than they appear in the picture.As for the sound quality I cannot judge point 1 was too much of a sticking point for me."
5,"Light, quality built and good sound","Am finding these headphones to be a good purchase. Very comfortable to wear, and your pretty much going to use these only in a more private setting. Although very comfortable to wear, the over the ear design does allow people next to you to hear some sound as well, they are are also a bit large."
2,Horrid fit,"These may be fine headphones, but they are made for someone with a huge head. The earpieces don't pivot on the headband, nor do they move on the headband to accommodate different width heads."
5,The best that i used so far...,"Am not an expert in Audio but very interested in this area. I have not used many headphones and this is the first mid/high end product that i ever used. But honostly the quality of the sound is AMAZING.... The clarity is outstanding.I have seen many negative comments in term of getting it fit to your head. I have relativly medium sized head however it is fits me and i never noticed that it is otherwise. I feel it is very comfy. I use it for music and videos.the only negative point that i noticed (and am not very sure because i haven't compare it with something in its quality) is the low-medium bass performance. Probably this is due to abscence of headphone AMP. Iam getting a new sound card (Asus Xonar Essence STX) that has built in AMP and i will try it, Hopefully it will improve the bass."
3,Great Sound but Poor Fit,"I purchased these headphones recently and was very happy with the audio quality. I'm not an audiophile by any means but these headphones did pick up directional cues very well with my Astro 5.8 mixamp. Unfortunately, they did not fit me well at all. The Headband itself has the wings that help with the fit but it would be better if they were actually adjustable. The cans were also very large for me. The quality seemed okay but nothing great. Be warned that the mesh on the outside of the cans is purple/pink. Overall, if you have a larger head these will be great headphones especially at this price."
5,My god my ears are just oh god.,"Fantastic, I hear every beat, every sound, it's just fantastic, I'm sure there's better ones, but man oh man for the price this thing is spectacular.11/10 would buy again.Side notes: People have said the bass is kind of lacking, personally, they're kinda right but not by much, I hear the bass quite well and booming in some cases, and for the price who could argue?Buy what you want and such, but this is definitely a fantastic pair of headphones."
5,Great Headphones with Amazing sound quality for it's price.,"this is my first audiophile headphone, it sounds amazing!at first i didn't know anything about soundstage, but after hearing my music,now i can understand what soundstage really means..all of my music sounded much, much better and clearer with this headphone.playing FPS games (ex. Battlefield Bad Company 2) is a blast, i can hear where enemy tanks are..i don't really like it's color but it's OK..With the price, and sound quality, i really can't say other than Amazing."
4,Audio Technica,Great headphones. superb value for money. very comfortable even for long time durations. not very portable but great for stationary use.
3,not as comfortable as i liked,"i'm not experienced in using top quality headphones. most of the time i use the headphones from my ipod for just about everything. so when i ordered this headphone i was kind of excited, my first full size. the reason i picked these is because in my net search for comfortable headphones it always came down to these ad700. i am very sensitive to head squeezing phones, and after reading as many reviews as i can handle i bought the ad700 based on what i read. i can not agree with most of you out there. i found these phones squeezed my head around my ears and after about an hour or so it would be uncomfortable enough for me to take them off. (i have an average size head) these may be very comfortable headphones for those who use headphones a lot and have a lot of experience to compare. as for me, i will keep searching.[...]"
1,Need a really Big Head for these things.,"I purchased these headphones because they looked like they were built pretty good and because they were fairly cheap. The problem is they just won't fit on my head and quite frankly how they made them so they can't be adjusted is beyond me. I was also persuaded by the 4 star rating, my mistake, I should have read the 1 star reviews and that might have changed my mind. I don't see how this is so highly rated or how it can fit on anyone's head. I'll look for some Sennheiser's from now on."
1,I returned them,"Nice big cans, decent sound, one major problem - head band size is not adjustable,so even on my big head (XL hats) it wasn't comfortable. too bad."
2,"Amazing sound, faulty unit","I love the sound signature but they are bass anemic, something I had read pros and cons about but my main concern is that one side is considerably louder than the other, this is unacceptable from a respected and trusted company as AT.For the kind of money these cost I would expect a better quality control."
5,My very first Audiophile Headphone,"Sound stage was wide, Perfect for live performace, opera music. I really like the openness of the headphone, feel very relaxing and natural when listening to music.Very comfortable. Bass was a little weak but the presence is there, Mid and highs are wonderful. Enough said, get this and you won't regret. BTW, this headphones are really large and you may want to try them first on your local music center. Enjoy"
2,I don't get it,"I don't get all the rave reviews for these cans? I use headphones exclusively on the PC for gaming and movies. These things have no bass, they sound small, like everything is far away and if you lean in any direction they'll fall off your head (and I have a big head). I want to feel like I'm in the action and be immersed by sound and explosions! If that's what you want too, look elsewhere. If you like to sit around and listen to classic music and hear every note, then by all means these might be the right ones for you."
5,LOVE IT!,"First of all, I thought the purple would kill this design but it actually nicely go with the design.It is definitely huge headphone I ever seen. I have big head so I needed something big. Also, one of my friend who purchased other headphone but she suggested that I need to buy something big so that my ear won't hurt.Well, I can wear this for more than 5 hours and it doesn't hurt my ears at all!Very comfortable! Love the design....though I may not wear this in public since the cable is way to long and it kinda looks like for a inside user.Well, if you want another fashion revolution, you can definitely wear them in outside.Of course there is downside for this item, but it is only my situation...I guessI have long hair and whenever I wear this headphone long period of time, my hair gets funny, shape like triangle. Well, no biggy~I hope this review help those of who are trying to find comfortable and big headphone!"
2,Really a AD700?,"I have a set of the A700 that are not open air, and thought it would be nice to reduce a bit of the pressure on the ears with these open ear ones. I can't believe these are actually considered the same model headphones. The sound is significantly better on the A700 when compared to the AD700. You will also notice that these to not pivot to fit your head as the A700 do. This causes them to feel like they are going to fall off my head when ever I move, unlike my other pair. Additionally the base response on these is non-existent compared to the A700. Even at moderate levels anyone else in the room will be able to hear what you are listening to. Over all these feel like a less responsive, sloppy fitting version of the A700. If you can handle them not being open air spend a little more and get a great value in the A700. I literally returned these withing minutes of opening the box!"
1,7 Days to Cancel Order,"An entire week to inform me that it is 'back ordered'. Disgusting customer 'service,' waiting an entire week to say that it isn't able to be ordered at the price given, considering they weren't even able to honor the order in the first place. I would caution anyone considering ordering from this company in the future. Ridiculously delayed response to find out they can't honor their advertised prices."
4,Great sound but very little bass,"Pros:Great hi'sGood mid'sGreat comfortGreat soundstageCons:Very little bass, no thump to itThese phones have really great sound going for them. However, if you like to feel the bass thumping on your ears, get something else.Edit: You can get a decent bass response out of these if you crank the low frequency up with an equalizer."
5,Great Headphones,"Great headphones at a great price. I use them for pretty much everything and they deliver for everything I use them for. From plugging them into my TV to watch a movie late at night or for my 360 to just good old music listening, these headphones deliver. Brilliant highs and mids and the bass is not overwhelming but it's not a disappointment either. Overall these headphones are amazing."
5,nice cans,"Headphones are really big, I didn't notice how big from the pictures, but very comfortable and sound great."
4,Great sounding headphone,"Just like a lot of the other users commented on - it is huge and ugly! The directional sound that you get from them when using a GOOD sound card (Asus Xonar STX) is awesome! Thanks to LevelCap for recommending these for FPS games (BF3).However, I'm not keen on the 3D wing band that they use. I have to tilt mine forwards on my head a little bit so it would fit better. Funny, after you use it for some time, take it off, go use the bathroom and look in the mirror, the top left and right sides of your hair are all smashed down. Unlike a regular head band (minor gripe). I had to mod them with the coax cable (CAT6 cable in my case) so they would fit better on my ears and head. They sound WAY better than the Sennheiser PC350's that I have - for games and music! Cheers! -3ndure1T"
4,Lasting quality!,"Let me start out by saying I'm not an audiophile, I am just looking for something that works as a headset for when other people are asleep (I work night shift) or when I would otherwise be a nuisance with sound pollution in my home. I've had multiple different headsets in the past that I've used but they all fall or break apart pretty fast, these have lasted me over a year and have not been babied so they get a huge plus from me!"
3,Almost no low frequency,"Bass-heads beware, if you like listening to any hiphop music, you wont get the right feeling with these, mind you I have a Sound Blaster sound card, designed to get the most bass out of my music experience.. even turned all the way up, I could not hear or feel ONE thump in any song I played for these..The bright side- if you are not a basshead,and like a crystal clear sound, these are great headphones for you,and extremely comfortable. The most comfortable full headphones ive ever put on my head, I was just disappointed in the level of bass output."
5,perfect,"fit my head,,,,,,,,, nice bass ,,,,,,,,,not enough bass can using equalizer to more explosion bass ,,,,,,,,never try open air so try open air"
3,Not What I Imagined,They are not as good as what I expected. There are many moreout there that I would rather have.
2,"Great headphones, poor durability","I've had my pair for about a month and half now, and found them to be incredibly comfortable with good sound quality. Unfortunately, the left speak came loose before the 8-week mark. These headphones are only used at a digital audio workstation and have been either in use by me sitting in a chair or resting on a desktop for their entire usage time. I have never dropped them, stood up and walked away while the phones are plugged in or any of the other common abuses of this kind of gear, so I have no explanation for their short healthy lifespan. If I send them back, I run the risk of AT not repairing them and I have to pay for shipping. So basically, I'm having a tech run a diagnostic for $25, and if the repair can't be made for $25, I'm going to buy a new pair of Sennheisers. I can't spend good money after bad and I won't keep spending money every couple of months to have a good pair of headphones."
1,"Cheaply made, horrible customer support","My pair of ATH-AD700s broke due to being put together VERY poorly, and when I called in to get a replacement, I was told that it would be $100 to get them fixed or repaired even though I paid less than that initially. After that I decided to return them and just buy from a company that WON'T try to screw it's customers over."
3,4th grade,"One chapter of this book was in my son's reading anthology. He felt inspired to read the rest. It was a good book, but not a keeper. We passed it on to his teacher, so other kids could read it."
5,Hot and Cold Summer,"This book was on my reading rendezous list. I read it and it was really good. It's one ofthose books where it it is funny, exciting, and kind of weird! It's about these two guys,Derek and Rory. They're best friends and they plan to do all this fun stuff in the summer but theirtheir neighbors' great niece Bolivia is coming for the summer and, well, I'll just let you readthe rest. If you are in the middle of trying to find a good book, consider reading this!"
1,industrial punk retreading,"usually I don't like to hate, but I have to make an exception for these guys. I saw them recently on their home turf and it was just soooo boring. like big black style with nothing that made big black compelling. not a single thing original other than throwing the random (and usually really annoying) ""eastern"" riff into the sluggy mix. each song sounds more or less exactly like the one before it to the point that I genuinely thought for a minute that I had accidently set my CD player to repeat. this is just trust fund kids slumming as far as I can tell."
4,BOOK REVIEW,"The book is in excellent condition. No one would know I did not buy it new. Delivery was a little longer than I had anticipated, but still within the prescribed time for delivery."
1,Probably not durable,"I bought a pair that look identical to these under the Weider brand. After a month...the fabric developed a hole and the contents, coarse black rock or sand, started leaking. The fabric is built for comfort, not durability...there was no inner liner and the contents were highly abrasive. Since ankle weights rub on the tops of shoes and the fabric is worn down from the inside by the grittin contents [without an inner liner], the short life is almost inevitable."
3,Dissapointed,"I was dissapointed with this book. I expected much more from a whole book devoted to small circulation. It gives you the impression that Yang never learned small circulation meditation from an actual teacher, but seems to have picked up techniques from ancient writings. Only a very small portion of this book is devoted to the actual practice of small circulation, the rest is translations of others writings and qigong theory which is included in his other books. Overall, I think there's some good info, but I found Qigong Empowerment by Shou Yu Liang to be much better."
2,endless beating around the bush,Probably author have much knowledge and experience but I do not understand why he spent zillions of words and endless (non consistent) repeating ... just to describe the crucial technique in practically few last pages of the book. Like he wanted to amaze somebody with the length of his book. I must proudly congratulate myself and anybody else who managed to read it to the end.
2,Not bad but tends to overheat paper,"This is generally not a bad printer however it does tend to overheat paper so that it comes out curly, which is very annoying if you print large documents or want to print high quality.The support desk said to resolve this by setting the paper type to 'transparency' for normal paper printing which indicates that this is a typical problem. It also doesnt solve it. Overall Im not very impressed with either printer or support and wouldnt get another Brother printer."
1,Brother Printer Nightmere,"Our company recently bought a refurbished Brother HL-5050 laser printer. After minimum use for only 30 days, the printer now jams constantly when we use the front loader paper extension! We were forced to buy this model printer because it was the only one certified to work with our Software on the Windows 7 platform with a 64 bit processor. We have always bought HP printers and aftwer this we will never by another Brother Printer!"
4,Works Fine for KitchenAid Mixer,"This does just fine to keep the mixer covered and dust free. I appreciate that it is machine washable, as well."
5,"Good Quality, Affordable Price!",I love having my small appliances covered on the counter. But sometimes they are hard to find and when you do they are outrageously priced. This cover is top quality at a nice price. You will not be disappointed!
3,Not what I hoped,"I searched for Kitchenaid Stand Mixer cover and this came up. It came with a tag that said ""Mixer cover"" but it was a TIGHT fit and I had to take the bowl off. Quality is okay. Other covers are much more expensive, so at least my mixer gets some protection in the meantime while I wait for a better fitting cover to go on sale."
5,"HOMEY, HYPNOTIC, AND FRIGHTENING","Joe R. Lansdale is the down-home verison of Stephen King (no affront to either author): with his own distinct regional dialect, he lures you into his web like a seasoned spider and doesn't let up until you're completely entangled. The characters are well-written, the story all-too-real and the climax was unbelievable. Mr. Lansdale's gift is that he tells a compelling tale without being sensationalist: his thoughtful, reflective tone is what keeps you hooked. It is dark and brooding, but excellent. I recommend this for those who enjoy compelling literature and anyone who fancies themselves fans of his work. Mr. Lansdale has earned yet another follower in me."
4,This Century's To Kill A Mockingbird....,"...I will give my thoughts on the novel. I think this story might be one of the best written stories I have ever read. It isn't perfect, and it tries entirely too hard to be cleaver and cute at the same time, but thankfully it works the majority of the time.The story is a great morality tale with a suspenseful twist. It is an exceptionally easy read and most people could finish it in less than a week.This book won't be for everyone, but I loved it and it will stay with me for a while. It isn't the kind of profound book that becomes apart of you, but it is a great read and a wonderful tale of innocence lost and the pains of growing up."
5,Extraordinary,"I finished reading this book almost a week ago and have been unable to pick up anything since. The hackneyed term, ""resonant,"" could not be more appropriate. This is simply one of the best books I have ever read. It can be approached on so many levels-- the coming of age story of Harry, racism in this country, a sexual serial murder mystery, a story of a family struggling with the times and each other. I have only read one other book by Lansdale and maybe that is a good thing as I wasn't colored by his mojo/gonzo persona that seems to pervade his catalog of work. This is an extraordinary work of fiction and one cannot recommend highly enough."
4,Good stuff,"I enjoyed this book. A quality read. It was very ""visual"". I could picture myself in that area and in that era. A good whodunit. Although I must say, that I was able to guess who the culprit was early on, not that that is a bad thing. I purchased this book based on past reviews and they were indeed correct. A worthy read. Give it a try."
5,Echoes of To Kill a Mockingbird,"A friend recommended this book to me. I knew Lansdale was a fellow Texan, and that he was also a favorite of Andrew Vachss (I never miss one of Vachss's books), so I picked it up. Lansdale is one of the best storytellers I've read lately. I could almost hear the book in my head as I read. ""The Bottoms"" is somewhat like ""To Kill a Mockingbird"", but it's definitely its own story. It combines an analysis of the evils of racism with a young boy's coming-of-age story. There are elements of mystery and horror in the book as well. Give it a chance. I think you'll enjoy it."
1,derivative and poorly written,"I got a copy of this book when I read that it had won the Edgar as best mystery novel of the year but was terribly disappointed. As others have noted, borrowings from To Kill A Mockingbird are so blatant that the big surprise about the identity of the Goat Man comes as no surprise at all. And anyone with any experience at all reading mysteries will smell the kller before the halfway point of the novel. A major disappointment."
5,"A deeper, darker Lansdale.","Last year a friend of mine told me about Joe R. Lansdale and the Hap Collins-Leonard Pine mysteries. Being from Crockett, Texas, near Nacogdoches, he knew I could identify with the stories and characters. They were great, but until ""The Bottoms"" they were my only experience with JRL.The era of the story was a little before my time, but the people and the setting really hit home. It is deep East Texas at it's best and worst. I read it in one long sitting and wanted to start reading it again. I can't get enough of his books set in East Texas, and people in other parts of the country should know the settings and the people are right on the money."
4,The Bottoms is A Top Story!,"Yes! That's right boys and girls, ""The Bottoms"" is really a top nitchety-notch bonfide whodunit -- hoohawww! Boy-oh-boy, guys, Joe adroitly dangles at least four strong suspects in front of you before you can even get the chance to pick and choose, and then, Wham-O! He's gotcha! Youbetcha!This novel is a lot of fun, like all the others that Joe has consistently cranked out. It's a bit more low key on the sidesplitting one-liners, in fact it's devoid of anything remotely funny, which is why there is a fifth star missing in my review. If I miss the humor, the author gets to miss a star. Fair is friar I always say -- you shave my head and I'll shave your... Oh well, 'nuff said. Great story, Joe R.L.! And let me buy the popcorn next time 'round!"
4,The Bottoms,"What Joe Lansdale can do with ordinary words should be illegal - The Bottoms crackles with high tension and razor sharp wit, white-knuckled suspense, and a good old fashion dose of the creeps. The Bottoms is Lansdale at his storytelling best. Gary S. Potter Author/Poet."
2,Predictable and lacks atmosphere,This book didn't provide any surprises. I knew who the killer was as soon as he was introduced. The identity of the goat boy was no surprise. The little insightful talks with dad were artificially introduced and the interracial relationship seemed artifical as well. I also expected a lot more atmospheric feel to the story.
4,Revisitation?,"Our book club agreed that it was a lot like To Kill a Mockingbird but not as well written. However, it did give more of a view from the Black perspective in these situations. I assume Joe Lansdale is white so I don't know if he's giving an accurate portrayal. It's well worth reading but I can't give it 5 stars. It gives an historical perspective that we cannot and should not forget. I hope it inspires others to ""do the right thing."""
4,Historical entertainment.,"Another of Lansdale's rural, east Texas thrillers. His depictions of our life in early 20th century southern US are both exciting, accurate & repugnant. His characters are both colorful & original. I looked forward to reading this book every night."
4,Good mid-90's alt. rock,"The production on this album is good. The guys were all session players. Sometimes the problem with studio players getting together is that they're so focused on precision playing that they forget about song writing and it becomes an album that only other musicians can appreciate.Some of that is the case here.There are some great songs. I had my hands on this disc in college as a radio DJ, and I remembered a couple of really good cuts.It was worth it to me to get it just for that. Plus, it's pretty cheap now. ""Witness My Death"" and ""I Will"" are especially good.The reviews for ""Read"" (or {read}, as it's spelled) are mostly good also. If you're a fan already, this is definitely worth the couple of bucks it'll cost you to get."
5,Dunlop 2.0mm - Nothing but tone,"A HEAVY pick, definitely made for jazz. It's got a thick, bass-y sound for solo lines. Strumming is a bit more of a challenge."
5,Excellent picks,"These are great picks that give you a richer tone than the tortex picks. These picks are also slightly smaller in all around size than the tortex picks.Note. The 2.0mm picks are absolutely black and not grey. These picks have a powdery coating that gives a greyish tint to the picks, but the coating wears off."
4,Great for keeping track of information,"I first purchased this in 2007, to help me keep track of information I got during my research.I like the family tree graphics, and it is easy to add new people to your tree. The best feature to me is the ability to find the reference person quickly.It is a very good program for novices like me."
3,Small Bag,"Bag is very small. Will hold a couple of shirts, a pair of shorts (no sneakers) and a bottle of Gatorade at most, possibly a PSP and a game. Definitely not for school books. It is otherwise well crafted."
5,Beautiful for a great price,"I replaced all of the knobs in my 1941 home with these and they look gorgeous. A previous home owner had ""updated"" all the knobs in the house with cheap, ugly gold ones. The glass on these is beautifully faceted and I love the clean lines of the locking mechanism (on the privacy version -Ultra Hardware 83636 Gainsborough Sonata Bed-Bath Door Knob, Satin Nickel). Now I feel happy every time I open a door in my home!"
3,There's been some thieving going on,"I don't know who stole from who first, but at least four of Gabriela Anders songs have arrangements and music lifted directly from Bebel Gilberto's Tanto Tempo and Tanto Tempo remixed CDs. One song sounding alike is a coincidence, but four? Either they share a lazy producer, or..."
1,Nothing like Wanting,"It's the same Gabriela with the sexy sultry voice singing so smoothly like only she can, but the material is just not there. Wanting was an excellent CD there was not one bad track on the CD, Last Tango only has one good track ""Love is Here to Stay"", the rest are way below acceptable.I have to completely disagree with the reviewer who said she was miscast as a smooth jazz singer, just listen to her voice, she is the definition of smooth jazz."
3,The Claudine Longet of Bossa Jazz Has Arrived!,"Anders'first album was a DNA match for Sade, but much more for the songs, band and arrangements than for her just barely on-key voice. I must give props for taste here, as the the players on this and the last Anders CDs are first-rate, and they groove wonderfully. However, if Gabriella Anders didn't look like she does (she's gorgeous!), she'd be playing a Holiday Inn in Yonkers. I gave the CD 3 stars, 1 for Anders and 5 for her Way-Out-Of-Her-League band."
1,Product Activation Woes,"This software is the latest in attempts at product activation, which does not take into account the needs of the consumer.It's been widely reported that certain kinds of disk maintenance software can fool the product activation into thinking it's been installed on a new computer. This would also preclude doing what I do, which is install on my main computer and my laptop computer, and having both programs point to the same data files on the main computer. (I use an 802.11b network in my house.)Another problem is that, say you uninstall the software after the tax season and want to keep the files. Guess what happens? Your tax files get deleted, because they are stored in a ""special area""."
1,"Say ""GOODBYE"" to Turbo Tax!",I won't buy this program anymore. I even return the one I bought before activate it.
1,"Great product, but Product Activation on WinXP is a big PAIN","I'd love to be able to tell more about the product, but after two days I can't get in. The Product Activation feature has me locked out, Intuit tech support has been useless, their web page has my problem listed as a 'known issue' with no apparent resolve. If you have Windows 2000/XP, hope your install goes better than mine -- wish I would have bought TaxCut this year..."
1,When will they learn,I have used Turbo Tax for the past 5 years but no more. Companies like this are setting some dangerous presidents trying to sneak in overly intrusive software locking schemes. Hopefully Intuit will see the error and resolve this next year. If a product has intrusive locks like this I encourage you not to give them your business.
1,"Horrible, includes malware and activation","I have bought this product for 6 years, never again. The new version can only be installed once, requires online activation, can only be installed on ONE computer. I can't work on my taxes both at home and at work. If I uninstall and am later audited, I can't reinstall in a couple of years. Worst of all, it installs c-dilla, a malware program which monitors and controls my cd writer. I am not convinces c-dilla is ever uninstalled. This information was never presented on the box when I bought the product."
1,A GOOD TAX PROGRAM TO AVOID,"I Have used turbo tax for many years and have never had any real problems with it. I have not purchased 2002 yet, but if it has all the problems that ive been reading about, Im certainly not going to use it. I will purchase it, evaluate it, and if not satisfied will send it back and purchase an alternative brand!!!"
1,TERRIBLE PRODUCT - TERRIBLE CUSTOMER SERVICE - zero stars,My CD contained nothing but 11 audio tracks. Office Max would not give me a refund. Intuit would not give me an explanation. I don't trust a software company that has no control over what code goes into it's product when the subject is something as important as my tax returns. Don't buy this garbage.
2,Gonna check out other options next year,"I've used TurboTax for years. I've used Quicken for years. Next year I am going to check out other options both for taxes and everyday finances. Between the product activation, C-Dilla being installed without my knowledge, and all the other advertising TurboTax has, that's it. I don't want Intuit to have my money any more."
1,Won't Work,I have XP and I thought it would work really well but it doesnt and there are so many ad's - I hate it. I bought Turbo Tax because of the special offer you have with Norton Utilities and it is not with it at all. I love my Norton Symnatic but I wish I could have left Turbo Tax on the shelve. I will go back to my CPA to handle my taxes.
1,don't buy this product!!,"After loading turbo tax on my system, I started having virtual memory problems, AND I have 1 GIG of RAM! I found out a secret program called C_dilla was hogging up system resources. I tried to remove this C_dilla program and my system won't boot.This turbo tax is [no good}. I will never buy another Inuit product again. I HAD BEEN a loyal user for over 4 years.NO MORE!"
1,Beware of Intuit C_Dilla,"I have been a consistent Turbo Tax user for the last 10 years, but what Intuit did this year with the installation of C_Dilla, aka Spyware, is unconscionable. As a result, I have switched to Tax Cut, and it works fine. There is no way I will install spyware on my PC. Intuit blew it big time on this one!"
1,warning,"""Warning"" After my husband installed turbo tax basic 2002 edition. Our hard drive went down.So we replaced this hard drive thinking I could just install our new turbo tax. Well we were wrong. You must remember the exact date we installed this program. I have no idea of the exact date; most people will remember passwords but not exact dates unless told to. So here I am just speaking out to anyone that might have to work with turbo tax. Warning this will mess up on your taxes. I had bought this at Target and now I still have to do my taxes buy hand.I tried to contact turbotax and intuit computer services. All I received is automated system. With No email address available I was unable to resolve this problem.Please send this to who ever May need a turbo tax warning so they wont be in the same boat I am.Your truly Mrs Ward."
1,No longer a good product,I cannot even get this software to install this year. I have used this product for over 7 years before.
1,Caution - Does not allow backup,"Anyone planning on using this product needs to be aware that it does not allow you to protect yourself from your Hard Drive crashing and it does not allow you to upgrade your hard drive. I backup my entire Hard Drive to a second HD using Norton Ghost. It does not matter if you use CD's, tape or what media you use. The new TurboTax puts hidden data on portions or your hard drive outside the normal partition and boot sector (even using NTFS). When I try to use the Ghosted image it tells me to Activate the SW. Of course this fails since it was already activated. By the way, Windows XP (which also uses activation) has none of these problems. I dont mind activation to prevent piracy, but Intuit went TOO far when they dont even let you recover from a Hard Disk crash (and I have experienced several)."
1,No to TurboTax,"Intuit's TurboTax installs C-Dilla spyware, which hogs your computers resources, and doesn't get removed when Turbotax is uninstalled. You would also have to purchase a new copy or spend lots of time on the phone with intuit trying to convince them your not a criminal if you upgrade yoru machine. None of that is worth it.How dare they add anything that could remotely be spyware to one of the most sensitive things (Tax return) that's on my computer."
3,Intuit better tread carefully,"After reading all of these reviews, it sounds like Intuit was a tad bit zealous. If that's true about having to buy another license if you switch to a new computer or hard drive, that is very wrong of Intuit. Not everyone copies the software. Give the customer the benefit of the doubt.Question: Does anyone who has installed Turbotax with the accompanying C_Dilla software experienced any problems burning CD's?And can anyone corroborate that the Safecast/C_Dilla stuff actually *does* written data to a hidden area on the hard disk that necessitates a low-level format to remove? Where did this bit of information come from?"
1,Never Again,"I have used TurboTax for the last 6 or 7 years and have never had a problem with it. I bought TurboTax 2002 before I heard about the SAFECAST/C-DILLA feature. Now, I have no intention of installing the software. I have already purchased TaxCut and will use that instead.There are other ways to keep users from installing the software on multiple computers. The use of C-DILLA was innecessary. If TurboTax keeps this up I will not buy it again."
1,It is a shame...,"I despise marketing garbage being installed on my computer. I have been a happy and loyal Turbo Tax customer for a number of years, but after reading these reviews I purchased TaxCut this year (will return Turbo Tax)."
2,How corrupt!,"2 stars, because it does still compute taxes, at least.But, the sales pitches and c_dilla make me certain I will never purchase TurboTax again.I would estimate it took me 50 mouse clicks to complete my taxes. Easily 20 of those were me declining sales pitches. No, I do not want to buy Quicken (I had to tell them no 4 times). No, I do not want our IRS audit insurance. No, do not subtract even more money from my refund by allowing me to pay without a credit card. No, I said I do not want Quicken!And I am figuring out how to uninstall this c-dilla thing right now. I wondered where this c:\c_dilla directory came from.Intuit goofed. I hope they go bankrupt now."
1,Activation security violation; returns become unreadable,"I keep my master boot record (MBR) write protected for security reasons. A change to the MBR breaks all levels of security except possibly BIOS. Activation of TurboTax 2002 failed because it attempted to write to the MBR sector of my disk. The Intuit site recorded that my software was activated, but the application itself would not run.An hour on the telephone with installation support produced a second activation code, and a disturbing clarification of the license.... I decided not to activate, returned the CD and asked for a refund (no response so far).I purchased TaxCut and found it equal or superior in all respects. It imports TurboTax 2001 data.I wanted to assign negative stars, but the option was not available."
1,only because there's no option for zero stars,"The version of TurboTax basic that I bought came with no product key. Customer support through online chat (only took a half hour once I managed to talk with someone) was no help - after paying to mail in the CD, they'll mail back a copy that includes the product key. No thanks - I'll return it to the store I bought it from - and go to a different product, or (gasp) do the return by hand. And the missing product key is apparently common - they've got an explanation on the website of how to mail it in if your copy is missing the product key.The copy protection feature would be enough to make me consider carefully whether I'd buy from them again - it's a real annoyance to have to call to activate it - if you don't want to do an online update.Don't waste your time with this. TurboTax has been great in the past, but they've lost a customer for good this time. I'll never buy this again."
1,Never again,"I, like many folks, have been using Quicken / TurboTax for a while now - for me, 8 years. That's over [money amount]a year to Intuit.The last few years, I've put up with the Advertising. ... ... This year, however, is the last straw.I gave TT2002 a shot - I wrestled with it for 3 days now, and Intuit's customer service is a Customer No-Service. My major mistake was counting on Intuit's reputation, and not checking out reviews before I paid out good money for this program.Another lost customer for you Intuit, moving to (sigh) Microsoft Money and TaxCut."
1,I will miss it but..,"Trusted TurboTax over years, used to work nice and beatifully. Now - SafeCast !! It just kills Windows. The only thing installed last 10 months was TurboTax - after that freezes and page faults. Looking the dump / debug files - SafeCast !! What do they think ?? Just my 2 cents and I know they will not miss my $ but what can you do ??"
1,bad juju,"I hate this product ... buggy setup, ... constant ads for other products and services, funky on-line registeration system, product updating service that crashes your system, doesn't work on a home networked operating system ... what is to like? Tax stuff maybe? ... who knows by the time you get to the tax stuff you are ready to throw the whole thing in the trash. No customer support to speak of - $14.95 on-line payment for tecnical support that must be used within 24 hours - call the company directly and register your displeasure -- at least you get some sympathy ..."
1,Goodbye Intuit,"This years 2002 Turbo Tax is a piece of [bad]. I am extremely unhappy with intuit for making us use this activation nonsense. It was a major inconvenience for me because I don't have internet access at home, I use a cell phone for my home phone, so I had to install it on my employers computer. Between the activation, the marketing [software], I will be switching to something else next year. This will be the last time I use Intuit products. Too bad for you Intuit... Looks like you .... a lot of people off. You won't be getting this customer back."
1,taxcut this year,thank you all for the reviews ... I have been using turbotax for years but am getting taxcut this year. As a side note ...ad aware software will remove spyware and can be downloaded for free.
1,malicious code secretly installed by turbotax,Turbotax installs malicious spyware code on your machine that IS NOT REMOVED when you uninstall the program. You have to go to the Turbotax web site and get the special instructions to uninstall this spyware. This is not good. I'm done with Turbotax.
2,"Sales Pitch, C-Dilla, I am through with TurboTax","I have been using Turbo Tax for over 5 years, and up until this year, had no problem with it. However, this year it is different. First of all why, if this is NOT freeware or shareware, do I have to put up with all the sales and marketing crap the program contains? Every other screen when doing your taxes is them trying to sell you something or get you to pay more for something else! It is annoying as hell!Then, there's the infamous C_Dilla directory. I am all against software piracy, but for TurboTax to install software without my knowledge, and to run processes in my computer that I am not aware of and that run even when TurboTax is not running, is just totally wrong in my book! To me this is called ""Spyware"", period!I really hope Intuit reconsiders their tactics, because there are plenty of options out there for Tax preparation software, and honestly, this was the last year I used TurboTax, because I am fed up with all this!"
1,*** WARNING READ THIS BEFORE INSTALLATION ***,"C-Dilla will be installed on your drive WITHOUT you knowing it. Read all about it ...To quote:""Well wonder no more - product activation has now made its way into one of the most popular software programs ever created, TurboTax. And, as an extra bonus, the latest release of TurboTax comes with Macrovisions's obnoxious C-Dilla malware. C-Dilla prevents you from copying the CD by disabling your CD-RW drive. That means it's monitoring your CD writing activities all the time. As if you needed more processes running on your machine. Early reports from some users indicate that C-Dilla has caused interference with other software and that it is inordinately difficult to get rid of, perhaps requiring a low-level hard disk format. And to make things even dicier, Intuit apparently did not overtly inform purchasers of the new TurboTax that C-Dilla was included and would be installed on their systems. """
1,"Beware, Activation, Single Install, No Reinstalls, Malware","I bought Turbotax for six years, never again! Turbo Tax 2002 allows one install on one computer, NO reinstalls, plus it installs malware. You must online register. You can't use on both home and office computer to do your taxes. You can't reinstall in a couple of years if you are audited. C-Dilla MALWARE is installed to control your cd burner. I am not convinced the C-Dilla is ever uninstalled. There was no notice on the box when I bought this item that these horrible things would happen."
1,Can only print and read forms from one machine,"Stay away from this years Turbo Tax because:1) The new activation scheme limits you to use it effectively on only one machine. The company says you can install it on different machines but you can only print and see the forms on the one machine that has been activated. The only thing you can do on any other machine is go through the interview process. You can not see the resulting forms or print without activating. How totally useless!2) If you upgrade your hard drive (easy to do with prices falling for hard drives) or get a new machine you must buy another copy of Turbo Tax, even if you removed the first install. Its like selling a wrench to a mechanic that can only be used on one car only."
1,Some program errors may cost you,"This will be the last year I use it. Bad vibes and how they affected me include:- Yes, the installation of lots of extra marketing slime-ware on my computer.- Could not understand why turbotax said my IRA contribution was not allowed. Here is the rub the TURBOTAX DOES CALCULATION INCORRECTLY. Turbo worksheet does the calculation incorrectly when you have all your earned income reported from sources that do not report on W2 forms. Ex. foreign earnings. Wonder how many other errors are built into their code.- Bought in Nov the deluxe version which includes a state version rebate. However, the state form may not be ordered until February and the rebate not obtained until then. <"
1,Bye-bye TT,"Please forgive the single star rating, there wasn't an option for no stars. Intuit has joined the parade of companies that treat their customers as thieves. They've included the C-dilla spyware with the TT program so they can prevent you from using the software on more than one machine. The utterly galling thing is that they don't tell you they've done this. This spyware cannot be removed with the deinstaller they provide. It remains on your system even if you remove TT and it runs all the time.I've used their products for years now but I will not buy it ever again. I am switching to a competitor and I recommend that you do the same."
5,FUN & CUTE BUBBLE BLOWER!!!,soooo cute and my daughter LOVES Ariel; The little Mermaid! We actually have the older model of this and my daughter and I love it but I thought we better get a new one since we have used the older one for 2 years and many times!!! Great toy and lots of fun for kids of all ages!!! Well worth the money! Great toy all around!* Buy a large jug of bubble mix as you do have to fill it often but it is so worth it.ENJOY!
1,Not reliable,"I bought 3 of these to use as a working centerpiece at a birthday party. All three blow different amounts of bubbles. One unit blows about five bubbles, one unit blows about fifteen bubbles, and the other blows only one large bubble. Even when all 3 units are lined together they do not produce a significant amount of bubbles. I am very disappointed! And yes, the motors are loud-ranging from annoying to ""turn that thing off!!""."
3,Good Toy - Just Shipping Issues,This toy is nice and worth buying but not from this seller. I paid extra for 2 to 5 day shipping to get it in time for a birthday party and when I checked out it said that I would have it in the five days. The next day I got the confirmation email which stated that it would not come for another 8 days and it had already been one day! I did not get it in time for the birthday party and I wished that I could have cancelled the order but of course they would not allow any changes at that point. I would not purchase from this seller again.
2,LOUD MOTOR!,"Bought this on an impulse. It blows bubbles just fine. The price sure was nice. The motor, however, is so loud that my 2 year old broke down in sobs the first time we turned it on. Compare to: a blender or a dustbuster. I fear it will burn out before long but that still remains to be seen. So far, it performs just fine. If you have a sensitive child, like I do, you might want to find a quieter machine. I hope this isn't the standard for ""mototized"" bubble blowers. You might as well put your bubble wand in front of your hairdryer and have at it! It isn't that the noise is really, really loud. I just didn't expect it to make noise and I guess my toddler didn't, either. I think she is getting used to it. I wouldn't have purchased this if I had known though."
2,Meh,"Ok, my friend got me this album. I listened to it and couldn't stop thinking to myself, ""Who the Hell do these guys think they are?"" To me, Forbidden sounds like either heavier Megadeth or softer Slayer, but with worse vocals on either side. Whoever this Russ Anderson character is, I hope to God he wasn't or isn't in another band because he is awful. The riffage here is sub-par, it's all played so quickly you never can get a groove going. And the solos are all shreds with no feeling in them whatsoever. The only thing this band had going for it was Paul Bostaph. Listening to this I can definitely see why Slayer got him to replace Dave Lombardo since, as I said before, these guys sound like a total Slayer ripoff. The bottom line is, there's ONE good song on here that grooves, and that's the title track. Everything else can go back in the bargain bin with all the rest of the wanna-be-thrash-kings."
5,About as good as thrash gets.,"I'm a HUGE speed/thrash fan from the 80s, but somehow I completely missed this band the first time around. Well, it was my loss because this is some great stuff. I just got this CD this year, and I can't seem to get it out of CD player. Every time I take it out to listen to something else, I end up putting it back in almost immediately.If you are into speed/thrash metal, then this album is a must-have. Great riffs, speed changes, lead guitar work, it's all here. All the songs are good, and many are flat-out great. It's a real unknown classic. There's absolutely no filler and the whole CD just rips from beginning to end.It's too bad that latecomers to the scene, like Vio-lence and Forbidden, never really found the success of some of their predecessors. For my money, this album is better than anything Testament or Flotsam & Jetsam ever put out during the same time period, and I like both those bands. If you are speed/thrash fan, you'll love this album."
4,LIKE EXODUS: THE FIRST WAS THE BEST !!!,"Like EXOdus with their debut ""BONDED BY BLOOD"", FORBIDDEN never was capable of releasing an album so great as their debut, FORBIDDEN EVIL. THis album is astonishing, trash / speed metal at his best, strong and firm, great chorus, great playing by the duo of axe-man. A shame, they deserved more. Drummer Phil Bostaph now is in Slayer and the other musicians are scattered all over the country."
4,classic late 80's thrash...,"Forbidden was criminally overlooked in their heyday. Released in 1988, ""Forbidden Evil"" boasts a clean,clear production. It is one of the last true thrash metal discs of the 80's. Awesome tracks such as ""Chalice Of Blood"" and ""Marching Into Fire"", still rip with intensity and malice. Compared to the other bands in their day (Testament, Anthrax et al), Forbidden were head and shoulders better musicians than the lot of them. While they went on to record in total 5 discs, Forbidden never really managed to produce the adrenaline rush they produced with this excellent disc. This disc envokes the true spirit of 80's thrash. Definetly a must have if you appreciate solid, mid to late 80's thrash."
2,"Some great moments, but disappointing","Its really hard for me to say that this album is as good as Testament's ""The Legacy,"" but there are some good moments, and a few bad ones as well. Some of the lyrics are social/political, and I don't really like that. The title track rocks big time, and there's tons of catchy melodies here and there blended in with some really crunchy thrash. I bet their other albums are much better than this, as it does seem a little immature."
4,good thrash from good musicians,"Forbidden is one of my all-time favorite bands.For all the thrash fans of the late 80's who never heard these guys, i recommend this album.These guys play with a lot of energy, and are all good musicians.This album features shredding lead guitars from Glen Alvelais and Craig Locicero, who also play complex,fast thrashing rhythm's.Also features outstanding vocals from Russ Anderson, and some great bass and drum work.Forbidden was a band that definitly should have been at the top of the 80's thrash scene."
5,Please be careful while listening to this!!!,"There are few words that can describe this kind of perfection. Suffice to say that I generally find thrash albums to be pretty generic, and there have only been a few groups over the years that have really piqued my interest. Here's one of 'em. With a brutal speed metal attack resembling that of Slayer, and soaring vocals reminiscent of Mr. Dickinson, nothing on this album disappoints. I won't bother with a track-run down, they all simply shred, shred, shred until you bang your head on a hard object! While the appeal of this album may be limited, its' mastery of thrash is without doubt. Metallica, Slayer, and the rest need not apply, as the Forbidden boys will simply rip them apart."
5,one of the best thrash albums ever,one of the best thrash metal albums ever total Slayer meets Iron Maiden no debut album is better than this accept maybe Flotsam and Jetsam Doomsday For The Deciever or Death Angel The Ultraviolence believe me I was there when it all came down I was the first person in Utah circa 1983 when the whole thrash metal movement hit took the debut of Metallica Kill em All to a party of at least 100 people I was always the metal dude D.J and no one could handle it after the first 2 minutes of Hit the Lights it was over and I had to put on Quiet Riot Metal Health what a bunch of Pussys and now look at it now Quiet Riot wiould play in your back yard for a Keg any way the first 2 Forbidden albums can kill any body and Russ Anderson is a great thrash singer so piss off all you non believers
4,East Bay Thrash classic!,"while not my favorite speed metal band, i have always loved the over the top syle of Forbidden. Russ Anderson's unique voice gives their tunes character and the guitarwork of Craig Locicero and Glen Alvelais is a distinct treat. i heard the opening song ""Chalice Of Blood"" so many times on the metal show that i used to listen to as a kid that it has become permanently implanted in my brain. a real thrash classic! i also love the title track on this album and the last minute or so gives me chills every time i hear it. with 8 strong tracks, Forbidden made a good decision to make this album short and sweet...allowing the impact to stay hard and not overstay their welcome. thrash on!"
4,Finally...a book that puts Nevada within reach!,This book is very insightful for those who wonder what Nevada has to offer other than tourism and casinos. A must read if you are thinking about moving to this state!
5,Great Read,"Well Joe is in trouble again. The brothers come down to New Orleans with Joe's girlfriend Vanessa for an electronics exhibition. During the exhibition and a party Vanessa is hit on by another guy and if you know Joe he takes it sooo well, not. The guy winds up dead shortly after Joe has a fight with him and surprise surprise Joe is the #1 suspect. But don't let the repeat story line fool ya. There's an old love story in the mix not to mention some great action sequences plus Frank get shot!!! I definitely recommend this Hardy Boys book to any long time fan (like me) or to anyone who is just starting to look into the series."
2,Very ordinary,"3 tracks on this CD, Rick Wright sounds terrible, David Bowie a little better and Dave Gilmour is ok, just. If you are a Gilmour fan like I am, you need it for your collection to be complete but don't expect quality music."
4,good deal,For the money you cant beat them. Got them as part of my girlfriends gift for V-day and she is still wearing them. They are great for second holes
1,"A shabby gift, so small they'll be lost in a jewelry case","I'm assuming this is the same product Amazon featured a week or so ago as a 'Gold Box' promotion. Anyway, they appear similar.These are junk. Tiny junk. The stones are miniscule. No woman older than six years, will be happy with them.Photos on the website are deceptive. The backing is actually larger than the teeny-weeny stones.I ordered these as a gift, but I'd be embarrassed to give them to anyone. Back they go to Amazon. Too bad they can't just be ground up in the Disposal, but they'd probably sift right through."
4,An important critique of modern society,"Bly sees a break down in traditional values, with the consumer society and television being major culprits.He also blames the baby boomers because of their disrespect of authority.(However, baby boomers were the first generation to be consumerized;since, the trend has much intensified.)He shows that the young can't grow up because they don't have real adults to guide them, and the commercial interests are keeping them at an adolescent stage.As he did in ""Iron John"", Bly laments the absence of fathers in the family, and the impossible burdens placed on mothers.The strength of the book is his exposition of a disturbing trend in modern society: the ""arrested development"" of the young, which is denying them a fully human life.Bly's social theory lacks rigor, but overall this is a very important tract for the times."
3,Iron John phase 2,"An analysis of the current generations or so via the analogy of literature: Jack and the Beanstalk, Ganesha, a wild girl and her sister (a Swedish story), to suggest the hierarchy of the cultural past has been lost and replaced with nothing - or we are swimming in a sea of adolescents. What have sons lost (or gained by this)? Ditto for daughters?"
2,a mess! Arrogant and self-serving slop!,"Although a fine poet and good translator, Robert Blyis way out of his league in this seemingly eruditecultural critique of modern society. He offers nothingnew in the way of critical analysis (most of his interestingideas are merely a watered-down spoon-feeding of Ortega'sRevolt of the Masses) and his partisian diatribes againstthe Republican Congress are annoying, unhelpful, and missthe mark. Although his musings about the generative birthof the human brain, the dangerous role of television inchild creativity and development, and the serious lack ofelders and the violence of youth are interesting, hisargument lacks structure, coherency, and is quite frankly,repetitive. This book is basically rhetorical masturbation!!!"
4,Love my new garlic peeler,"I had never heard of a garlic peeler until my sister-in-law told me she purchased one at a kitchen store. So I went onto your site and found one. Knowing my son uses allot of garlic also, I purcased two of the peelers. My husband is the cook in our family - lucky me - and he loves the peeler, says it works great. We especially like the included box holder that keeps the peeler clean and in good shape. For families that use allot of garlic, this product definitely is for you."
3,It works for not many garlics,"Actually I like this product, but it only works for the first few garlic cloves. You can peel 1-3 garlic cloves pretty well at first. When the garlic peel starts to stick and accumulate inside the peeler, it doesn't work well anymore. You need to clean it, wash it and dry it. It is really good for those who just need one or two garlic cloves, but not good for those who want a lot."
3,Works More or Less,"It does work if you cut off the root end of each garlic glove. Have used others that work much better but bought Oxo because we have always had good results. With this item, not so much. I fault the material from which this is manufactured; too clingy. We will next try one of the red tubes; totally different material."
4,Love the storage box,"This works great. A tip is to begin on a work area with dry hands and use dry garlic. One drawback, thus the 4 stars, is when peeling many cloves (getting into the dozen or more range), the roller begins to get sticky on the inside. It doesn't work quite as well at that point. Either you will need to wash the roller and let it completely dry before finishing the task at hand, or put up with it. When sticky, the cloves will not peel as well or as quickly.I prefer this roller, because it comes with a vented storage box. The vents keep the roller dry and the box keeps the roller from being squished in a drawer. A thoughtful addition."
5,I Love This Thing,I ordered this because it got good reviews and they were right. It does exactly what it says it will and it works really well. I am a big fan of the Oxo implements and was not disappointed.
5,What I expected,I am satisfied with this product. It works exactly as described and finally I can avoid that stron garlic smell when cooking.
3,amazing,"it was troublesome to start with but once you get the hang of it,it eases the chore of peeling.to get the best out of this peeler: 1.make sure both peeler n garlic are dry. 2. insert same size garlics n only 2 at a time. 3. don't press too hard or u'll end up squeezing the juice out n wet the peeler. 4. found out garlics left out of fridge for a week peel easier"
4,Must Have!,"This is the simplest, but one of the best kitchen must haves I have purchased in a long time. The peel is whisked of the garlic in seconds. Easy to clean, easy to store. No more garlic hands!"
2,Not for me,"I just haven't found this to be terribly efficient. I'm quicker at peeling garlic than at using this and then needing to clean it up. It hasn't been worth the effort of getting it out, so it's just taking up extra space in my kitchen."
1,"WOW, what an amazing rip-off!!","I suppose this will actually peel garlic, if you use it just right. Never, ever, ever get it wet. It will not work. Also, you must trim off both ends of the garlic, or it won't peel. And then, I still have to hand peel some of the more stubborn pieces. It's just not worth the money. If you look around, you can find much cheaper garlic peelers out there.....BUY THEM!!"
2,Will NOT play MP3s on CD,"It was misrepresented or unclear when I ordered it. I thought it would play MP3s on CD like some of the other CD players. It is solely a CD player with a digital FM/AM tuner. Not a bad product, just not the functionality I expected."
1,Worst textbook ever,"This is the worst textbook I have ever used so far.I took a course by one of the authors, and even he admitted that the textbook needed more proofreading.Some of the equations are slightly wrong, making this textbook very unreliable source. You simply have to cross check the equations because some (though not many) are wrong. Harder than what it really has to be too. The previous edition I would say is far better."
5,inflation station,Works great for the price. Other reviews say slow but takes approx3-5 min to inflate a spare auto tire. Not bad for the price. I like it.
4,"Works great, but I wish it had an A/C adapter","I've used this pump to inflate tires on my jogging stroller and my bicycle. It inflates the tires very fast and easily (MUCH better than a hand pump). The only thing I didn't realize was that the only power option is having it plugged into a car - not a huge deal, but it would be more versitle if it had both options. For the price, I can't complain!"
2,I couldn't continue reading,It is very difficult to writte about traditional shamanismus nearly 90% of writters only give some oppinions about it and some poor receipts for life to try to cash some money(above all americans).They are not real shamans.Maybe real shamans don't writte any book in their life.The book is very nice and big but the content is not powerful.It took me time to read it until I left it somewhere.This woman can be a great woman when helping people in live but when doing this through this book it doesn't reach the point to change reality which is what powerful shamanism is all about.Again this is my personal oppinion.
5,A keeper for regular reference!,"I had heard this woman on HayHouseRadio, and gave the book a shot after going to her webpage and learning more about her. It was a GREAT FIND!Written for enjoyable reading, PACKED with a great range of information. One of the best I have found for those genuinely interested in detox and cleansing - not the ""instant one pill"" route.This book will be kept in easy access range - because there was so much I found I will return to over and over again.The life and home cleaning sections got me BUSY :) !!!"
5,Jeanette's biggest fan,"Jeanette has the sweetest most angelical voice I've ever heard.The way she sings those ballads is really wonderful.Songs like: Corazon de poeta, frente a frente, el muchacho de los ojos tristes, comienzame a vivir, toda la noche oliendo a ti, soy rebelde, por que te vas, to mention some of her hits.HIGHLY recommended."
5,Have to get it!!,"Well if you're planning to buy this Album, you will be glad that i do recomend this cd. What really gets my attention is her voice. She has a lovely voice."
5,Must have !!,I loved this book. It is a definite must for those who enjoy a great plot. I can not wait until she writes more! I would recommend this book to all my friends! The characters are really engaging and the twists are unexpected.
5,It stands the test of time!,"Solti's Chicago was the first Mahler 9th I ever heard (on LP).. it was absolutely devastating then and still it today! I just listened to on CD for the first time in several years. It wrecked me again. Critics be damned! In my mind, this is a 9th for the ages!"
5,Proffesional,"James Van Praagh has written yet another very well organized and crafted book that will be a benifitt to anyone, a believer or non believer due to the blending off both psychological and real life examples and spiritual additions - not so much his average book. If you are a non - believer you can still gain a perspective on convential ways off dealing with grief, if you are a believer, you will benifit from the assurances and comfort he gives.I say decide for yourself, and not listen to the skeptics."
3,Not As Good As His Other Books,"I just finished reading ""Healing Grief"" and I must admit that I was disappointed in the book. I read both of Van Praagh's other books and enjoyed them immensely. I think the reason I didn't care for this book as much as his others was because I don't feel that feeling about ""losing a job"" or ""losing a home"" should be in the same book as losing a loved one or someone close to you. The book seemed to drag on and I was actually glad to finish it so that I could move onto something more interesting."
2,Another Grief Vampire has a hit book!,"One of America's most applauded GRIEF VAMPIRES, HAS ANOTHER HIT BOOK. A BOOK FILLED WITH SEMANTIC PAGE FILLER THAT SEEMS TO TOUCH SO MANY IN NEED. LIKE SLYVIA BROWNE, CHAR MARGOLIS,JOHN EDWARDS AND OTHER GRIEF VAMPIRES THE PROFITS ARE HIGH, FOR MIND-READING CHARLATANS.THOSE OF YOU THAT REALLY NEED HEALING GO LOOK AT SIGNALS BY JOEL ROTHSCHILD, TUESDAY'S WITH MORRIE BY MITCH ALBOM OR MANY LIVES MANY MASTERS BY BRIAN WIESS THEY ARE ALL HERE AT AMAZON AND SPEAK VOLUMES ABOUT LIFE, LOVE, DEATH, LOSS AND TRUE HEALING."
1,disappointing,"There are some excellent books to read if you are suffering from grief, but this isn't one of them. It is missing the ring of truth, but even if you do believe Van Praagh (a big hurdle for me), it's very awkwardly written in that it tries to cast him as some sort of bereavement counselor, which doesn't work, at least not for me. Instead read Closer to the Light by Melvin Morse, M.D. (which gives examples of near death experiences of children) and Hello From Heaven by Bill and Judy Guggenheim (which simply offers hundreds of after death communications people have submitted to them). These books are very convincing, even to the skeptic, and very comforting. Another book, The Afterlife Experiments by researcher Gary Schwartz, Ph.D. is an excellent introduction to several good psychics who have done well in various test situations, often delivering stunning hits."
2,"Tried to like it, but no real insights here","I am still a Van Praag fan, but this book is more like a remake of ""George Anderson's Lessons From the Light."" Even though the stories are interesting, there are no new insights--at least not enough to shell out more money on another self-help book"
3,Practical Advice with Some Interesting Stories,"All in all, I believe the book was worthwhile. The anecdotal stories sometimes aren't as practical as one would like and seem a bit like a sales pitch, but there are practical exercises and insights that are helpful."
5,Grief Relief,"Having heard James Van Praagh in person, and having lost my dear husband this year, I purchased this book. I can't describe the sense of comfort I derived from it. The author is ""right on"" as far as the stages of grief that I've gone through; I had pretty much withdrawn from life. His words were truly healing for me and gave me the desire to reclaim my life and get going again. I would highly recommend this book for those suffering loss of any kind."
5,Thrilled with the versitality,I just love these things! I have ordered several of them and use them for a variety of reasons.I keep a few on the note pad I use in meetings and use them to flag items that I need to address outside of the meeting. Unlike other flags these are duable and do not bend or easily fall off even when my pad is thrown in the bottom of my bag or when the flags are lifted off and repositioned time and time again (typically after about 8 to 10 repositions the sticky becomes less secure).I keep this in my shopping cart and watch for a price change that I am willing to pay.
5,Worth The Price If You are Building a Reference Binder or Textbook,"These are great. They are a little expensive but they are worth it if you are studying for a big exam like a PE Exam (Professional Engineering Exam) or some other type of test where you will need tabs to flip through quickly on exam day. They are also good for reference books or binders you use a lot and need to find info quickly. Solid, durable, and easy to write on with a permanent marker."
4,not for delicate pages,"i use these to mark chapters or rules in my law text book which are printed on very delicate paper so when i take them off at the end of the semester sometimes they tear the pages. however, they do stay put and are very easy to write on and do not bend."
4,Hip hop with that smooth Kapisi groove.,"As a big fan of King Kapisi's previous work, I was not disappointed when I bought Kapisi's latest album. Although it took a while to get into it, the tracks get better and better, finishing with the very stylish (and addicting) ""Screams from da old plantation"". I recommend anybody buy this album as it has something to suit most people, hip hop fans or otherwise."
4,A good night anywhere,"Not the best of Art Blakey's albums, but far from the worst, either. The title track, at 11-plus minutes, is taken a little bit too frantically and approaches recklessness, but ""Kozo's Waltz"" is a nice 24-bar blues waltz, also up tempo but more controlled. Wayne Shorter and Lee Morgan play their usual front line parts well. A good outing for the Messengers."
3,THE ONLY BLAKEY'S CASTING ERROR,"A mentionned in another review, this CD ""is not immediately accessible"". I would say that it is always deceptive. Benny Goodman once tried to book Mc Coy Tyner but they realised that how great musicians they could be, it didn't work. It is the same with Wayne SHORTER. Everytime he takes a solo, those who know the Jazz Messengers feel sorry Benny GOLSON in no longer in the group.There are tens of better Blakey's CD. Anyway this one is worth buying for the precious work of Lee MORGAN and Bobby TIMMON's, whose playing in much more subtle than some critics may have said : During his long career, Blaker never had a bad pianist in his group."
3,Two Good Tracks MAYBE,"As a diehard fan of New Order and Electronic, I am somewhat disappointed with there latest effort. I sit here waiting for new material and then comes along Twisted Tenderness, which by the way is the best track on the CD. I am used to the pulsing dance tracks that made Raise the Pressure so awesome. I hope in the future Barnie and Co. come up with some more hip tracks!It is an album that portrays some different material that they probably could not publish under the Warner contract, so for that I applaud their efforts, but give the fans what they desperately need - ""Stop if you got Love""!"
3,Bittersweet,"The band is best when combining a strong, catchy beat, Marr's layered guitars, mood-enhancing & melodic keyboards and Barney's stilted vocals. This album lacks quality in its rhythms. Marr is great - as usual. Keyboards don't take over the songs as often as they should. There aren't many hummable tunes. The vocals are the same as they are on every Barney album - not remarkable in any way."
3,Roll the bones,"I found this album, like some previous reviewers mention, to be a quite disappointing item for Electronic's usual high standard. Besides the fact that the band name isn't appropriate any longer (guitars are a dominant feature on this album), the band completely ditched the progressive elements of their debut. The result is a album with some good songs, but overall, it's an unfocused and uncohesive affair. Johnny isn't capable of pulling out memorable riffs and melodies (for once), and the guitars often sound like a bunch of uninspired noise. Also, the drums are pretty obtrusive. The bluesy ""Vivid"", ""When she's gone"", and the title cut are the standout tracks here. Not a bad album, but Electronic obviously have slipped from the cutting edge. The CD-single releases ""Vivid"" and ""Late at night"", containing some techno remixes, aren't much interesting, too."
1,One Star for one BAD book.....,"Invierte tu dinero en algo de Provecho...Este Libro es tan amarillista como el show que Maria Celeste conduce. La senora Arraras deberia de mantener su empleo del dia al 100% porque como escritora tiene Muy poco futuro, sus palabras son mal enfocadas y lo que es Peor, en este libro- EL SECRETO JAMAS ES REVELADO! Al parecer su excusa para no revelarlo es porque ni siquiera ella Lo sabe-Pero Oo El Dinero que le Pagaron debe de ser muy Bueno- ya que se atrevio a publicar algo con lo cual su credibilidad como Periodista se pone en Prueba."
1,DID NOT SATISFY ME!,"AS I WAS READING THIS BOOK I THOUGHT TO MY SELF ""COULD THIS ACTUALLY BE TRUE?"" AND WHEN I FINISHED IT I FOUND MY ANSWER ""NO"". THIS BOOK DOES NOT FIT WHAT SO MANY OTHER PEOPLE SAY. AND AM I GOING TO BELIVE A JOURNILIST WHOS OUT TO MAKE MONEY AND A PSYCHOPATHIC MURDER'S STORY OVER THAT OF A CLOSE,RELIGOUS,AND DECENT FAMILY? I THINK NOT!"
5,The correct title in Spanish: El Secreto de Selena,I translated the book from Spanish to create the English version
3,Helpful Tool,"The large triangle is a helpful tool. It allows easy layout, etc. There are some things that could be home made that could substitute for it. Owning it is a convenience. IT IS VERY PRICEY!!!! for what you get, but as said above, it is the convenience of having it."
5,An Absolute Classic,"Possibly the greatest novel of all time.Every human soul should be required to read this at least once in his/her lifetime.What blew me away is how 'modern' it is. Written in the early 1600's, Cervantes (via Don and Sancho) pontificates without end on how ""today's"" society has lost its will, its moral fiber, its work ethic, its lack of respect for things like....chivalry.The Ingenious Man of LaMancha, the Knight of the Sorrowful Figure, is a man for all times. His 'madness' is, quite truly, a 'madness' of which we could all benefit.Long? Yes. Lots of divergent/side stories? Yes. What great work doesn't answer 'yes' to both.And, yeah, it's funny too."
3,The First Sit-Com,"Caveat: I have only made it through the first 8 hours.All the good that people say is pretty much true--of every episode.For me, the succession of episodes plays like a sit-com: I like the characters, the set-up is funny, and after a certain number of episodes the invention wears thin.The reader for Audible.com is beyond praise, making the story more engaging than it would otherwise would have been for me."
2,Good songs poor recordings,"Some nice pieces but the recording leaves a lot to be desired. Loud entrances, some record loud others soft. Not much fidelity."
3,"Great casting, not so great story","I bought this series mostly because I am a fan of Toby Stephens and Rupert Penry-Jones. sadly, their skills are somehow underused in this slightly lackluster series. The thing is that there isn't really anyone I really warmed too, maybe, given the story, that's a good thing, but for a series meant also to entertain, it's a big minus. It wasn't terrible, by any means, just not very engaging."
1,99% fiction,"This program is based on public statements made by the four people. The details are filled in by the script writers. This produces a double dose of fiction.It is the consensus in the espionage community that the public statements are very inaccurate and are colored to make the four people appear to be more honorable than they were.Then the script writers use their imaginations and they are not old enough to have lived as adults 70 years ago and are not familiar with the era.One example of the colored statements is that they were fighting Adolph H. This does not match with their continuing spying activities after 1945 when Adolph did not exist.I suggest that instead you buy Tinker Tailor Soldier Spy available her on Amazon. The author, David Cornwall, served in British Intelligence during the war."
4,"For those like myself who were mystified by ""Blunt, the Fourth Man"" and ""Another Country""","For those like myself who were mystified by ""Blunt, the Fourth Man"" and ""Another Country"", this version of the story makes it all clear and understandable. These brillilant young Britons were carried away by their abhorrence of fascisim and naively embraced the originally idealistic cause of communism until they gradually became Soviet agents and were too far immersed to break free. At last the story of these men is given a plausible reperesentation from their callow youth to their fateful ends in ignominy. Toby Stephens and Samuel West are excellent, as is the rest of the cast as well. Highly recommended for those interested in the history and politics of clandestine agents and traitors."
3,Recommend another film,"I would recommend that if you are interested in the life of Johann Strauss Jr., you can look up a really well done biography movie by Walt Disney from 1963, and it is called ""The Waltz King"". In my own opinion I feel it is a much better movie. At this time it is only available on VHS, but one can only hope they will issue it on DVD someday."
1,"Very, very bad sound","On the box it states that it has a DTS sound track, but it only plays 2 channel stereo. The music is poor and there is no story line."
4,Powerful speeches,Presented here are 16 fascinating speeches by key historical figures of the 21st century. I listened to the CD to get an understanding of both the contents of the speech and the emphasis of the voice used to convey the dynamics of the situation. These are very powerful speeches and my 3 preferred ones from this selection are1. Rev. Dr. Martin Luther King (Address to the civil rights marches)2. President john F. Kennedy (The Cuban Missile crisis)3. Mr. Adlan Stevenson (Confrontation with the Russian ambassador in United Nations over missiles in Cuba).
4,inspiring and educational,"I was basically looking for Martin Luther King Jr's speech and bought this CD. Though the background music gets old pretty quickly, the sound quality and speech selection is spot on. Listening to these various great speeches, I definitely got a better sense of history while learning new insights into powerful public speaking."
2,four stars if you are a very careful person,"I'm not.While I love the idea of the nesting magnetic measuring spoons, especially in neat colors, I thought they were a bit fragile. In fact I think I broke the one with the Tablespoon trying to spoon sugar that had developed a bit of a crust out of a cannister.Somebody is making them in metal. Sounds like a good idea to me."
5,"Great smelling, lingers long","This air freshener lasts a good while, a few hours, gets rid of odors fast. Will purchase again."
2,Poorly Organized,"I used this book while taking a basic phlebotmy class in the summer of 2007. While it got the job done, I found the information to be poorly organized. The chapters are not well put together and there are too many of those little ""information"" boxes everywhere. I thought the book was confusing. I now have one called Phlebotomy Essentials by Ruth McCall (which my school went back to after only one semester of using the other one) and it is much better. It even has an optional workbook. Hope this helps."
4,good book for phelbotomy students,I think this is a pretty good book for phelbotomy students. The book goes into great depth about various blood tests and the equipment used. The language used was simple enough for laypersons to understand. This book also prepares you for the National exam.
2,Deceptive Title,"I thought this was going to have definitions of the various terms used by Shakespeare, but it only has lists and lists of insults. I admit many of the terms are somewhat straightforward, but I really was trying to find something that would ""educate"" me about how the insults came about and perhaps their meaning at that time. If you are looking for lists of insults, however, this is the book for you."
4,How to insult the weak minded and leave them wanting,Shakespeare boiled down to the greatest lines. If you ever wanted get the last word and leave someone with a blank look this is a fine way to do so.
1,SMALLFLOWER RETAILER,"Galium-HeelI THINK THAT THE LEAST THE SELLER OF THIS PRODUCT COULD DO TO LET THE CONSUMER MAKE AN INFORMED CHOICE, IS TO MAKE THE BOTTLE SIZE BIG ENOUGH TO LIST THE INGREDIANTS."
5,Amazing Anime Series,"Just going to keep it short. At first I was very skeptical thinking that this series was just some typical sci-fi post apocalyptic series that was nothing short of just a girl running around kicking butt. Don't get me wrong the action in the series is great. But what really captured and pulled me in was the story and characters. Its was hard putting in that last DVD knowing the series was about to end, but a wonderful ending it did have. If the series continues in the future I'll be buying it zero day.5 stars for Animation, Story, Characters, Action, PersonalityIf you a fan of anime in general I highly recommend this. If your looking for more of a comedy check out Desert Punk."
5,Awesome anime check it out,This series is awesome with a great story and really heartfelt moments between the characters. The CGI is done great here and the animation in general is great. It has to be pointed out that indeed some episodes seem to have been done by another studio and many anime spend too much budget at the beginning to the detriment of the latter episodes although I never found it to be disturbing enough to pull me out of the enjoyable series as a whole. If you are on the fence rent the first volume and the rest will not disappoint you.
1,Not available,"This book is not available. For a current take on legislative drafting, search Amazon for ISBN 1587330156"
3,GRASS BAG REPLACEMENTS,rECEIVED BAGS BUT HAVE NOT PUT THEM ON TO TRACTOR YET AS THE OLD BAGS ARE STILL WORKIN BUT WILL NEED REPLACING VERY SOON
1,cleaning this is a chore,"It performs well in terms of cooking, but I've never been able to get it properly clean. Even though the finish is non-stick, gunk builds up on it that's very difficult to get off. I wound up giving it away and replacing it with a Le Crueset grill pan."
4,quirky Aussie fun,I am a huge fan of Muriel's Wedding and this movie is a little bit reminiscent. I liked it. It's very quirky and fun. Something different!
4,Different poster!!,"I actually just wanted to bring attention to the poster used for Love Serenade. In Australia we had something completely and I mean absolutely completely different to this, which I assume is what was used to market it in America. I have found this to be the case for many of our Australian films - the posters are made to be more colourful and 'lighthearted' I suppose is the word I'm looking for. Other examples I've come across are posters for Love and other Catastrophes and The Castle. Now onto the film, I thought it was great!"
3,"Decent, but very little in the way of surprises","Many novels have covered this ground before, to say nothing of all too many Star Trek episodes, so I don't know why we need one more exploration of time-travel paradoxes. I went through this book twice looking for something that Chronospace adds to the idea, and the only thing that I could find was a description of how the mechanics of time-travel might work.Steele does his best to develop his characters, but the ""chrononauts"" seemed a bit stale. Don't look for any romance here. The designated ""primitive,"" Dr. Murphy, is somewhat better but a lot that is initiated has no follow up.Favorite line: ""It was only slightly less cold than Donna's voice the terrible night she demanded a divorce, ..."""
2,Inadequate Potboiler,"This is an effort to write a time travel novel with causal paradoxes as a prominent part of the story. This book is an expansion of an award winning novella and the stretch marks are obvious. The quality of writing and characterization are pedestrian. Books like this can be saved by a clever plot and application of causal paradoxes but the paradoxes are predictable and the plot is marked by the sudden appearance of super powerful aliens defending the structure of space-time. This type of Deus ex Machina device is poor. The author has also a rather poor grasp of 20th century history. In this book, a key event is the destruction of the dirigible Hindenberg with the circumstances of that event influencing the survival of the Nazi regime. This is a laughable idea and a very shaky foundation for the generation of an alternative pattern of history."
5,Hard to find books,"Just what I was looking to buy for my granddaughter. We have the New Potty book. After reading it over and over, I decided to buy more books from this author."
4,Gift,"Will be a gift in a couple of days. Great book, grandson lovess it, hope Grandpa loves it just as much!"
5,Great book,I loved reading little critter books to my sons when they were little. I just started to purchase them to read to my grandchildren. Mercer Mayer is an amazing author of children's books and after raising three son's I can tell you it is not easy to keep little boys interested for long but the little critter books hold their attention. The story lines are adorable and the pictures are great.
3,Needs Some Proofreading,"This book is a more tedious read than it needs to be because of a plethora of grammatical errors. The ill-placed comma on page 152, for example (""Finally, the communication structure or network, developed in the group impacts information flows among group members.""), is the kind of thing that makes you stop and re-read the sentence a few times to make sure you extracted the correct meaning. There seem to be a lot of similar mistakes. I was required to buy this text for a course I was required to take. Since I wasn't looking forward to the course, my attention span and patience was short enough to begin with; this book is not helping."
3,Misleading description,"I got these on a gold box deal, which is a good thing other wise they would be going back! the packs are only 50 sheets per, so really it is only the size of two normal stacks. Normally, Post-its come in stacks of 100. Nowhere on the description does it say they are any smaller than normal size, or the actual number of sheets per pack."
3,Warning: this is only the small size,"The picture and descriptions are misleading: it makes it appear that what is being sold is all the pictured Post-It sizes. In fact, this is only the small size."
1,1400 vs 700 ???,"The picture on this ad clearly states that it has 1400 pages meaning 100 per pack. So how can it be that there are only 50pgs per pack? Is it 1400 or only 700? That's a HUGE difference. And if the packs are ""half-sized"" like many ppl are saying then it is a big hairy LIE !!"
4,Perfect,I love Post-it Notes they save me from having to remember everything on my own. I was very pleased with this pack it will last a very long time as there are 12 full sized pads!
4,Good for reminders,"I use a lot of Post-it for reminders around the house. I prefer the Super Sticky Post-its, and if they were available on this site, they may not have been the price I wanted to pay.The canary color is fine. I don't like the dark blues and purples, since those colors make it harder to read what I have written on them.Since I am a big Post-it shopper, I hope Amazon will continue to sell them and in the future at bargain prices."
5,My favorite size post-it notes,"These 3"" by 3"" Post-it notes are my favorite size notes. They are big enough to wrote a short note on, but small enough to fit anywhere. I use them as bookmarks, for note writing, for reminders, and so much more.I noticed that the price on the on this product fluctuates. There is a nice online tool that I use to help catch a good price on Amazon, this tool is called ""Online Price Alert"". This tool will send you an email when the Amazon item price reaches the target price range that you specify. If you search on ""online price alert"" in Google it will be come up at the top. I find this tool to be very helpful."
5,Saved a trip,"I happenned across these Post Its on Amazon, just when I needed some. Ordered them & received them with Amazon Prime before I could've made it to a store & they probably cost less."
5,Very bright! Nice lights!,Have had this product for about 2 months. Very good quality! Nice lighting for solar. My only negative comment is that they are cheaper at Lowe's (35!)than on Amazon!
2,bag was wrong size - manufacturer slow to respond,Model type and # of lawnmower was used to order this accessory at the end of May. Product was recieved - good condition and appears very good quality however wrong size.The problem I encountered was the long time it is taking to get the issue resolved. They do NOT have a replacement bag to fit my Honda mower. So I will return the incorrect bag - but they want to charge a restocking fee which I think is not correct in this case.So be careful as you order.
2,Very disappointing,"I had problems with this book. it seemed choppy and took a long time for the parts of the story to merge into a cohesive plot. I also felt that, unless you had read the first book of the series, ""The Greenway,"" you would not have had any idea who the characters were or how they fit together. There was next to no independent character development in this book. The story does finally pull together and become quite interesting in the last third, but it took a bit of an effort to stay with it and get that far. I'm not giving up on Ms. Adams yet, as I did enjoy ""The Greenway,"" but I do hope subsequent books are far better than this."
2,Quite unlike what I had hoped,"The impression I took from the pictures of this pick was that they would be pliable, perhaps of a material similar to a hockey puck or a regular Dunlap pick. I had hoped the stubbier width would make it easier to hold. However, they are made of a more rigid plastic. I was unable to produce the rich tones my thirty-five-year-old acoustic guitar can give. At best,I could get only a harsh scratching sound, the pick's influence distracting from my Mossman's timber. Even banging out campfire songs on my giant 12-string generated a sound I didn't enjoy. Alternating up and down strokes was uncomfortable for me too. Oh well, my mistake. (I was able to modify a standard width pick by gluing a rubber disk to it; this worked. Therefore, I suggest the difficulty I had was caused by something beyond my not being used to its width.)And, I wonder, has anyone who used the stubby picks longer than I noticed a difference in the life of their strings?"
4,Helps a beginner,Am just beginning to play guitar and my teacher showed me this pick. It was much easier to control and didn't slip in my fingers.
4,Best of Dio stuff.,"Good if you want a ""best of"". I would just buy Heaven And Hell and Mob Rules and be done with it."
5,Awesome album!!!,"This is a must have for any serious metal fan. The live show is awesome too, Dio delivers like he's 21 LOLGo grab it, you won't be disappointed!!"
3,Black Sabbath - The Dio Years,Not as good as Black Sabbath with Ozzy and not as Good as Dio alone but still a good cd.
3,Over Rated,"Dio in his prime can't touch 70s Black Sabbath with Ozzy, other than the final two albums Ozzy did. For real Black Sabbath fans, stick with the Ozzy era or better yet Tony Martin. Dio had a few good solo albums- Holy Diver, Last in Line and Sacred Heart. With 3 new tracks recorded with Dio. Heaven and Hell is easily the most over rated Sabbath album."
3,More Dio than Sabbath,"As a strictly Dio-Sabbath-years fan, I had read Tony Iommi's statements that the new songs on this album took them back to the Heaven & Hell days; after hearing it I strongly disagree. I think the three new songs fall more into the Dio category of music as opposed to the Dio-Sabbath category. These songs sound like something that would have come off of Dio'd ""Lock Up the Wolves"" album and wouldn't really belong on a ""Heaven and Hell II"" album.The first tracks on the album you have all heard before, and there is really no reason to buy this album except for a live version of Children of the Sea. If you are going to spring for the album just to get the new songs, don't expect too much. ""The Devil Cried"" is probably the best of the three, a long slow Dio-esque dirge that tells a good story. Other than that, I think you can stick with what you already have in your Sabbath collection and save some money."
5,Black Sabbath - 'The Dio Years' (Rhino),"Sixteen track compilation of Sabbath's stand-out repertoire of when Ronnie James Dio fronted them. Tunes here are pulled from the lp's 'Heaven & Hell' ('80), 'Mob Rules' ('81) and 'Dehumanizer' ('92) + there are three newly recorded tunes, all three are good. I literally have chills going up and down my spine when I hear these British metal gems, like ""Neon Knights"", ""Die Young"", ""Mob Rules"", the awesome ""Voodoo"" (simply been too long), ""Children Of The Sea"" and so on. For any of you out there that may've been too young or in some case{s} not even born yet when this material first hit the streets, TAKE it from someone who was lucky enough to catch this band's 'Heaven & Hell' tour with Blue Oyster Cult as co-headliner (anyone else remember that?), it RARELY gets any better than this. Highly recommended. LONG LIVE BRITISH METAL!"
5,The best yet,Until I heard it I wouldn't have believed it. Ronnie James Dio stepped into Ozzy's boots in very big way. This is one their best.
4,Wow! So much great music I missed so long ago.,"Like one or two other reviewers I just saw Sabbath along with Megadeath (in Columbia MD) in 2007 and was thrilled and amazed. Dio's voice holds up very well live and theses songs stand out without any need to refer to Sabbath when Ozzy was there. So I ran out and bought the CD. All the songs from Heaven and Hell are terrific. Iommi and Butler perform the way that artists can only after they have spent a lifetime feeding off of each other. While my personal favorites all came from H&H.;, there are no weak links in the recording.If you are like me, and think there is no way fast/speed heavy metal can appeal to your over-40 years of age years, give this collection a listen. The lyrics are sophisticated, but not overbearing. The tunes are hammer-hard, but you might just find yourself whistling them later on."
4,Excellent release....,"Ozzy w/ Sabbath did have their place in metal history. We all know it. But Dio outperforms Ozzy in every way. RJD hits his notes, writes better music and is a true showman. Plus, Dio is class. Always has been always will be. The Dio years are the greatest by far and Sabbath is much better w/ RJD than with Ozzy. This cd is very good and a much better listen that any othe Sabbath out there. Where is Sign of the Southern Cross - WTF? Anyway, Dio will be regarded as the one of the top 3 performers of alltime and he still rocks at age 64 or something like that. Get this cd and you will here true classic metal."
4,Good but......,"Could have been great. First, ""Computer God"" & ""Time Machine"" should be on here instead of ""TV Crimes"" & ""After All."" Also, ""Sign Of The Southern Cross"" should be on here instead of ""Lady Evil.""Also, this should have been a four CD box set. All the Dio era CDs should have been remastered and released as Black Box 2."
1,Messed Up Copy with Missing Pages,"Beware. This edition came with missing and mixed up pages. The back of the book highly praises the Cornell University Library (themselves) for being so good as to make this book available to the huddled reading masses but, as I received it, it was unreadable from page 193 forward. Also, the illustration in the front of the book gives away the ending of the book. I ordered this for a hardcore Zola fan who was very disappointed."
3,'one of Zola's most disturbing novels',"There's an awful lot of anguish in this novel which focusses on a young woman who has a short-lived affair till her lover leaves her for a career abroad, telling her to move on. Madeleine subsequently meets and marries Guillaume who is damaged by his strange upbringing and years of bulling at school. Just one person had ever shown him kindness, his old friend Jacques. It only comes out after a while that Jacques was also Madeleine's one-time lover...What starts out as an interesting scenario, however, soon had me thinking 'stop over-reacting!' Brooding journeys through the night; a lugubrious Protestant servant preaching damnation; some extraordinary co-incidences and much melodrama. Not Zola at his best."
4,More brilliant simiplicity of Iranian cinema,"Majid Majidi is the master of making films about ordinary people and places, and creating something eminently complicated and watchable. This deceptively simple film tells of a boy and girl from a poor home, who each have only one pair of shoes. While the little boy is at the market, returning from the cobbler's where the little sister's shoes were being repaired, he accidentally loses the shoes. Knowing that the parents are in dire straits, the boy and girl devise a scheme to share the little boys shoes, so that the parents will not find out.This simple plot could be made into a light comedy, but here it is a tale of struggle, respect, and hard work. The children are absolutely amazing, and the direction is very absorbing."
5,spellbinding...,"I had to almost force myself to sit through the beginning of Children of Heaven since it seemed so slow, and visually dull. However, the payoff for ""enduring"" the first part was well worth it. The movie was gorgeous, meticulous, and I consider it to be the most elegantly simple, yet powerful movie I've seen in ages. I guess the story could be recapped in few sentences, but it's deceivingly complex. It's a story of poverty and sacrifice, a little like The Gift of the Maji. I believe just about any age viewer could appreciate this film. In hindsight, my initial difficulty had more to do with being dulled by big, hollywood productions, which are made to grab the viewer at every turn. This film unfolds organically, and is understated in its beauty. I hope you'll watch it. I can't imagine you would regret it."
4,its the little things in life we forget...,"i wont recap the plot to this film since its already been shown above and by other reviewers. this film shows how things so simple and that are taken for granted by us each day, are very meaningful to people, and particularly to the kids in this film. the accomodations that have to be made for these two kids to be able to attend school and in sharing one pair of worn sneakers really humbles you. to the kids shown here, school is important but important is their recognition of those less fortunate than they are, even though its hard to imagine. a fabulous movie. i think some people may find it a slow pace from the normal western plots of movies in the u.s. but its the slow pace of the film that allows you to appreciate the lives of those shown, and the things that happen throughout the film. it really simplifies life, and makes you think. i recommend this film highly"
5,"Beautiful, poignant film","My thirteen year old son and I really enjoyed this movie, and it was a great introduction to foreign films for him. You couldn't help but connect with these tender children and their daily struggles, represented by something so pedestrian as a lost pair of shoes. Highly recommended for ages 10 and up."
5,Children Of Heaven,"Even in a land where parents are ruled by duty and devotion, the simplest problems of their children can become mind-boggling. Majid Majidi creates a dizzying dramatic farce out of a tattered pair of shoes, and takes us on a great ride through a wonderful and ancient culture with characters that are fearlessly believable. Tenderness and mercy are the most precious prizes."
3,Sympathy through suffering,"It's a movie about sympathy through suffering. Happily, the suffering these beautiful children have to endure is not terrible; it is only the loss of a pair of shoes. Children should never have to suffer anything worse than this. It is, however, tragedy enough to unite them, to cause them to share in each other's suffering and selflessly seek the best for the other. They do not solve their problem, despite valiant efforts, but watching them make decisions with other people in mind is beautiful. A quiet, enjoyable film."
3,Just a bit overrated?,"Okay, I don't have a heart of ice, ""Children ofHeaven"" moved me in parts, but is it really a work of art? A lotof the posted reviews are keen to single out the absence of sex and violence and special effects in the film as a virtue, but it seems to be more a knee-jerk response than any thoughtful analysis. Are all American movies really that trashy and corrupt? And does lack of sex or violence necessarily make a film good? ""Children of Heaven"" may be an effective antidote to truly rotten American films that glorify exploitative sex and violence, but it doesn't really exceed the best examples of American filmmaking. It's been done before and perhaps, better."
5,Amazing,"I was deeply touched by this film. As a modern-day cyber 'chica', who feels proud to call the US her home, I was completely blown away by how this film brought back memories of my childhood in Mexico. I too remember the headmaster, the morning and afternoon shifts at school, boys playing soccer in the evenings, and yes, getting the most out of my shoes. I thank Mr. Majidi for his message of simplicity and love and for reminding me of the importance having the right perspective. I am recommending this film to EVERYONE I know."
4,an excellent film,"this film shows what happens when a brother and sister have to co-operate after a vitally important pair of shoes goes missing. The children have to share one pair because they have to conceal the loss from the parents.There mother is ill and there father not in regular work, the lost pair of shoes journey is shown and the kids battles with each other are written very well.It's sympathetically written and shines in a light to how difficult living in contemporary Iran maybe.Wonderfully cast and concisely shot. I couldn't recommend it more highly"
4,They're mixing bowls.,They're pretty and blue and haven't broken. The three sizes nest nicely and afford me a nice selection when choosing which one to use.
1,Missing the black handle,I received this case without a black handle installed. It is the correct case but the factory never installed the handle. Poor quality control. The case is useless without it. This gets returned.
3,Not as universal as I would expect,"Bought this case to replace the case for my craftsman circ saw. The molded supports had too small of an area for the saw plate and the saw motor. Using a knife to cut out some spots I was able to make it work, but I would think something that is made to be universal would be molded to fit a bigger saw and maybe have some wiggle room for the smaller saws. The area below the saw that was molded to hold extra blades is also too small for a standard 7 1/4"" blade, seems more like a mistake in manufacturing that the company is trying to unload."
4,Circular Saw Carrying Case,Very nice sturdy case. Bought it for my saw that didn't come with a case. Was not the same name brand as Milwaukee but it fit at an angle so that I could close the case. I wanted a case that I can protect and store the saw on a shelf.
5,Phenomenal,"This is one Teena's greatest CD's and lord knows she has had many great ones, Ivory, Lady T, Naked to the World, are some of my favorites and this CD is right up there. A fantastic production, almost every single song will blow your socks off. This CD was produced and distributed by Teena herself on her own lable, as a result it got NO AIR PLAY, like it did not happen, and now you can not buy it anywhere. It's a tragedy, one of the greatest CD's of all time, by anybody, bar none, is languishing in complete obscurity."
3,Dead Air,"Was a little slow going at first, then the pace picked up and held my interest.The actual writing left something to be desired. I'm glad I hung in and read the book. Over all I enjoyed the read."
2,truck ventshade,Tape needed to attach to vehicle was not adequate in size to properly attach the front corners.It was lacking about 2 inches where it curves around front mirror area. The most important spot to attach to vehicle and no tape. I was lucky I had some.You spend 40 dollars for 2 piece's of extruded plastic and they skimp on 2 inches of tape. How smart is that?
3,Tamron AF 28 - 80 mm f3.5-5.6,Ok well slightly dissapointed with this glass. I was hoping for something a little better but what the description was and what I got I don't think the seller was quite sure what they were selling. It works with my D5100 but no AF (auto focus) function or at least I couldn't get it to autofocus. I was able to manual focus but some pics were not tack sharp. Still good glass and cheap too would be better suited for inside work macro mostly.
5,what a great lens,"I bought this when i first got my d90 kit and wasn't sure what to expect with the crop factor of the digital sensor. I have a nikkor 18-55 vr, nikkor 15-200 vr, and several larger zooms. This lens has rarely left the camera unless i needed more range. The af is faster than my silent wave motor nikkors, the image quality is sharp with accurate colors. It does have a lot of plastic and the front lens rotates when focusing making polarizing filters more of a chore to use but overall for the price this lens takes the cake hands down. If you own a nikon camera with a screw type focusing system (glad the d90 can focus swm and screw type) this is worth adding to your camera bag or leaving on the camera for a walk around."
4,Tamron 28-80 AF Lens,"This is a great lens. I use it with a nikon SLR camera and although I am a beginner in photography, this lens makes it easy to look like a professional. What I like most about this lens is the the feel. The lens is very sturdy and has a rubber piece for easy control. Highly recommend."
3,You get what you pay for.,"This is the lens that came packaged with my Nikon N80. I've used it for over 1 year and deem it average. The autofocus is slow and noisy. Lens flare is an issue at almost every focal length. And the focus ring rotates which makes using a circular polarizer something of a pain. For [the price]it is passable. However, I recommend that you dig deeper in your pockets and buy something more robust and without the aforementioned niggling problems."
5,Great Walkaround lens!,Got this to replace my nikkor 18-55 lens as it starts to have problem taking night shots and wanted a set of lens for walkaround. I have taken over hundred pics since received it 2 days ago. Tack sharp pictures with superb accurate colours. Comparable with my old nikkor kit lens in terms sharpness and colours. Love the range and will be using it for my friend's wedding soon as backup wedding photographer. Excellent for sceneries shots esp day and night. Set ISO to 800 for night sceneries and got excellent detail pictures. This must be my next best lens after my nikkor 50mm f1.8 fast lens. Best buy for this price!
2,Do not buy this lens if you own a Nikon D40X,"Just got this lens and had to return it. For some reason the motorized auto-focus does not work with the Nikon D40x body. There is no manual switch on the lens, so the AF function is controlled by the body. Unfortunately the software in the camera will not recognize the lens. Read a couple of reviews just now, which confirmed this. Quality of the lens seemed pretty good otherwise."
2,Too small,"These are good, but really almost too small for a chip bag. Maybe a small individual chip bag, or smaller items. Otherwise they are great."
3,Above average,"I was looking for something strong and elegant. This product is a bit better than the ones you'll find in stores, but nothing to write home about."
3,strong magnets but some were flaky on the bottom,"These little magnets are strong and I like that.Three of the magnets in my package were peeling on the bottom. There is a thin piece of shiny metal on the bottom of the magnets and on 3 of the magnets, the shiny metal had peeled off and the magnetic surface underneath was powdery and flaking off. I threw the damaged magnets away and kept the ones that were not defective."
4,Very Strong,"The magnets are strong enough to hold a few pieces of paper, or a heavy print (like a wedding invitation). My only complaint is that one of the 8 broke after it fell on the kitchen floor. I don't think that's a deal-breaker, but it means you should be careful if you share my tendency to push magnets to their limits."
4,Great Bike!,"This is a great bike and great value. It was fairly easy to assemble even though it ships without any directions (just a bunch of pamplets for individual features). I purchased the 19.5 inch frame model and had to adjust the seat down from it's factory setting (I'm about 5'10"") but after that very comfortable ride. Very good quality construction. Love it."
3,Not for mountain bikes,Product was not made for mountain bikes because the strap to attach it to the bike frame is too small.
3,"Strong enough, but taugh to installed","This is a functional rack as advertised, but is not easy for installation. I think may be the accessories are not enough for some bikes, or user instruction is not clear."
3,So-so,"I didn't expect the frame to be hollow tubular steel (thought it would be solid). The reviewer beneath me said he had limited instuctions, I absolutely none (if you take a good look at the picture it's not too hard to figure out thought). Other than that it's pretty damn good for the price. It adjustments for different sized bikes and options for different attachment locations. The springy clamp hold-down thing works great as well."
2,no instructions what so ever,"speedy delivery, however the package has almost no instructions at all. Only an illustration of how it looks on the bike after the installation with the major parts labeled. That doesn't help me figuring out how to put it onto the bike. and [...] doesn't even list this product."
1,Horrible,"This was a bad buy. The C-clamps would not fit my bike and there were parts missing!!! This is not the first time I have had problems with Bell products either. I also bought the U-Lock. It was so hard to install and the clamps again were not big enough. I am never buying a Bell product again!!! I really would not even give it one star, but I had too."
1,Are there fenders?,Based on other reviews I did not expect to receive directions. The rack does not fit the bike I was trying to fit since it has a rear fender. I mistakenly calculated the rack would fit but significant modifications are required. Otherwise product meets value expectation.
2,Bell Rear Bike Rack,"The Bell rear bike rack has the shape and function I wanted but not the parts to install it in all applications. It comes with some very small ""c"" clamps that didn't fit the wider diameter of the seat post on my PT Cruiser Bike. You can find and paint ones that will work at your local home center. It does come with some parts that I have no idea what they are suppose to do or where they fit. Directions that are more specific would be a great idea."
2,Not the best,"It looks like a good rack. Although I can't actually install it on my bike, because the hardware included is too short. I think it's a 24"" bike. So I think we're going to put it on my daughter's 20"" bike. Other than the fact that it won't fit, and has horrible directions (if you can call them that) it looks like a fine rack."
4,A Good Bike Rack,"The rack definitely fills the bill for a light to medium-duty rack. The spring trap works well to secure the gear and the construction seems solid. The installation is a bit tedious, with lots of little screws and nuts to mount on various adapters (and one of the nuts was missing from the package...). However, I think the rack will do fine for my basic needs. It's a good value, all in all."
1,NO INSTRUCTIONS!!!!! Don't buy this rack if you've never installed a bike rack before,"I thought the bike rack was a good cost, but when I got it, I was very disappointed with the lack of instructions and materials it came with to install. The rack itself looks like it's good quality, but only if you can get it installed. I have attempted to put this rack on my bike 4-5 times about 1 hour each time, and I've also had my boyfriend try to help me and we still haven't figured the stupid thing out!!!! So no it's sitting in my garage and I have went to buy a bike rack elsewhere."
1,Poor Product Description & Instruction,"It does not fit any of my 3 bikes. I wish the product description could have been more clear, so I don't waste money like this. Now it is collecting dust in the garage."
2,"Nifty, and yet. . .","The product seems sturdy and seems like it would work well. However, a major problem makes itself apparent during installation. The directions given are terrible and the diagram for them displays a different product. The product received does not even match this picture on the site. It also does not seem to fit as it should. Some heavily improvised connection will be needed. I still cant get mine on. Ultimately its going most likely going to be returned. I wouldn't recommend buying this online where you cant inspect it, but rather see it in a store first, if possible."
4,Baptist study bible,At last a Bible where you can get a clear idea of how traditional but not fantical Baptist think. The bible is well laid out with outlines and vital information on each book and the footnoting is excellent with a rich variety of comments from some of the better thinkers of the Baptist way.For a Baptist the book is a plus for a non-baptist it is educational tool in comparative christian thought and theology.
5,Criswell Study Bible,The best study Bible that I have ever had. I have two but want a third so that I can give it to the grandson who has surrendered to the ministry.
5,The Best,"Of all the Digital TV stands in my house, Peerless is the best. Elegant, steady and easy to assemble. By far better than the expensive one I bought for my family room."
3,A good 80's romantic album,"Camilo entered the mid-80s with this album. Of the ten songs, I listen mostly to four or five, regularly. The rest are not of my liking.""Amor de Mujer"", ""Te Amo"", ""Acompáñame"", are some of the ones I like.The musicianship, arrangements, and orchestration are good. The songwriting, for my taste, declined a little by this time.Still, it is a good oportunity to hear one of the best voices: Camilo's!!Enjoy!!"
5,Pure Luxury!,"Lynn Harrell is a master in his craft. His rendition of the beautiful and haunting ""Kol Nidrei"" is breath taking. Soaring to the incredable last note of E, in the range of the violin, the listener is left in awe as the cello sings with perfect, sweet vibrato. Few cellists are able to carry this off so brilliantly as does Mr. Harrell. This piece alone is worth the purchase.DvorAik's Cello Concerto shows off what the instrument can do. From the deepest somber note to rapid double-stops, this is a marvelous showpiece in which the cello takes eventual control of the orchestra. Thrilling and beautiful, this recording is one of the best versions ever recorded."
5,Superb!,This book was wonderful. The story was written with a refined sensitivity. I really enjoyed it. I've never been disappointed by any of Jeri Massi's books.
2,Nonstick? Right,"I have had my analon ""professional"" since 1996, I loved it at first, in fact, I don't even own metal utensils, so I was confident it would never scratch the non-stick finish. Now, 10 years later, I can tell you that all the pans I barely used, are still fine, look good. The pans I used daily (the fry pans) are absolute messes. I cook with egg whites a lot, so I think that having something so hard to get off really had taken a toll on the pans.At $60 (the current price) I would consider how much you use cookware. I must replace my frypan now and have a ""non-coordinated"" set. Do your research on non-stick finishes before making the investment.In all fairness, my favorite pot is the stockpot and I use it many times per week for stews, spaghetti, manwhiches, and it still looks great!"
5,Very satisfied,These pans look good and are flat so are very good for smooth top stoves. Follow directions and use the lower heat... shouldnt have any problems. The lids fit well and the pans clean up very well. I first tried an anolon and cirulon pan to test a couple years ago. Now we ordered this set plus 5 other pans because amazon had a great sale price. Close to $1000. retail value for $252.31 with free shipping. They shipped from all over but was well pleased at how fast they arrived. Thes are probably the best pans we have had and would recomend them. I do hope the lady that needed the replacement is taken care of by this company as the product is nothing without the guarantee that this company will stand behind there product.
1,Beware of scratches,"i bought this set about a year ago and use only plastic utensils on it, but the non stick coating is already starting to come off. i do not recommend this set. this is analons lowest line of cookware, so that may be the reason for its poor performance. other than the peeling nonstick, the they work great."
2,good at first...,"When we first bought this stuff (about 3 years ago) we thought it was fantastic! Things cooked well, and clean up was a dream! But now we are starting to reconsider our desire to use it. Repeated use and cleaning has started to flake off the ""non-stick"" coating. Even though we have only hand washed it with a sponge, and have never used metal utensils. Now we are at the point where we are starting to worry about bits of non-stick coating coming out in our food! We'll probably switch back to stainless steel pretty soon. Its harder to clean up, but you don't have to worry about it!"
5,"Great value, great quality","I did a lot of comparisons and this Analon set came out to be the best value. You can find cheaper products from companies like Farberware, but those products will start to wear out over time. The Analon is much more durable and the quality is top notch.My shipment came with a dented lid, but I'll give them the benefit of the doubt and write it off as a rare mishap. Otherwise, I love this set."
4,Great Cookies - Awesome Company,"I bought two boxes (cases) of these cookies to give as Christmas gifts. Both boxes had a Dec. 06 expiration date. I was not pleased with that short term expiration and emailed the company. I was sent replacement ""fresher"" cookies without any questions or return of the original cookies purchased. I was very satisfied with the cookies and the company's customer service."
5,Great book!!,"This is an incredibly informative, easy to understand book about ketogenic dieting. I highly recommend it."
5,The Ketogenic Diet - Dieter & Practitioner,"This is a very indepth book which describes in great detail the process by which the ketogenic diet occurs and how this impacts different individuals. It is very technical, yet extremely informative."
2,Temporary,"""You should also read www.c-k-d.com, particularly the forums.""The people over there generally do not like Lyle, due to the fact that he is not a product of his philosophy whatsoever - google him.I tried this diet and it worked...to a point. I couldn't perform my work outs because I was so drained all the time. As soon as I resumed normal eating I gained back all the weight I had lost. Then, I just went crazy over carbohydrates for awhile and put on more weight than before, although some of it was muscle (which isn't too bad) since I continued working out. However, I'm still never as lean as I was BEFORE the Ketogenic Diet (I didn't do the CKD), and I was on Tom Venuto's Burn the Fat, Feed the Muscle (e-book)."
1,Ketogenic Diet,"This book is so amateurish it's embarrassing. Heavy on supposition, and lean on facts. So many concepts could have been presented far more easily with a few diagrams. This author is merely masquerading as a scientist.I've read many of the good reviews and they seem decidedly like the coached words of friends and relatives dropping in. The best part about this book is the cover artwork."
1,No Thankyou,"""Ketogenic diet"" is just a fancy sounding term for the recycled high protien Atkins diet which *real* health experts have been warning people about for decades.Yes you will lose weight....temporarily, but it will be extremely hard on your health.The author is a regular contributor to the usenet group misc.fitness.weights where the majority of his posts reflect an arrested adololescent's mentality and a total absence of a mature thought process.No wonder he is recycling obsolete and unhealthy nutrition advice"
2,WASTE OF TIME,"There are so many posts from people who obviously ignore the truth of fat, carbohydrate, and protein metabolism. Everyone seems to be showing all the information in this book as fact when in reality they have not even looked at REAL research on MEDLINE. I'm sure you have lost weight on a low-carbohydrate diet. Anytime you completely cut out a macronutrient you are going to be eating less and losing weight. IT'S ALL ABOUT CALORIES PEOPLE! A lot of the initial weight lost is water. I recommend going to mypyramid.gov. You can get a food plan listed in servings you need. Go to a dietition. LA weightloss is better. I rated this book a 2 because it simply lacks real information that you learn in a college nutrition class, but since people have lost weight...buy it if you like. You'll only gain it back. Lifetime weightloss can only be acheived by a LIFESTYLE CHANGE.I love the reviews that say ""excellent for low carbers"" and ""dieters"". That makes it sound like it's a hobby."
1,buyer beware,"Slow delivery because they use the post office parcel post to send it to you. When you get it there is no box, just the bottle, ours looked like it had been used. And check price, I think I overpaid for a tester. So why am I keeping it? It's a very good perfume, both my wife and I like it. We recommend it, I bought Pleasures intense from a different dealer,whom we gave 5 stars because they were fast, brand new in box, and it's very hard to tell the difference in scent. You could buy either one as long as its Eau De Parfum. Get the better price deal. And read the ad very closely."
1,Keep your lazer disc copy!,"What was MGM thinking? This DVD is TERRIBLE! About 30 minutes is cut and a very important conversation just before the end of Act One. They cut the overture, intermission, entra'ce and exit music from this beautiful film. The music in this film is what carries the story along and for some reason MGM must of had a brain freeze. Also what gives with the 2.0 for sound? I saw this in it's wonderful 70mm 6-channel stereo sound. The kind of sound that will never be brought back to any theatre screen. I say lets ""Boycott"" this film and send MGM a message not to tamper with perfection."
1,Hawaii Disappoinrment,"I have been waiting for many years for the DVD. I read a review which indicated the length was 161 vs. 189 minutes the original roadshow version. I saw the film in it's original version. It is a beautiful film. It had 6 track stereo sound and was in 70 MM. The laserdisc set released a while back contains the complete uncut film. Additionally, it contains the original stereo soundtrack which accentuates the Elmer Bernstein score, one of his best.Maybe one day MGM will get it right."
4,Hawai`i nei!!,Beautiful made film version of original novel. Finely captured the kama`aina (native) life during the begining of the Eastern influence.
3,Thanks for the warning...,"I was just about to add this to my shopping cart when I read, to my horror, that 30 minutes were cut in a spectacular display of bad judgement on the part of MGM. The ""pre-Hawaii"" scenes were, to me, the most compelling scenes in the film: Jerusha saying goodbye to her little sister (movingly recalled years later when Abner says goodbye to thier daughter); Jerusha standing up to her husband during the voyage to Hawaii; the tragic death of one of the wives during childbirth and Abner's subsequent ""You WILL LIVE, Jerusha"" speech (which happens to be my favorite moment). I guess for now I'll stick with my double-VHS copy until MGM comes to thier senses."
2,Is anybody listening?,I am so glad that everyone is talking about the edited version of Hawaii on DVD. I love this movie and remember seeing it from a balcony seat on the BIG Screen....absolutely breathtaking. No one makes movies like this anymore. Are the movie companies listening to anybody? 'Hawaii' most definately needs to be re-released without edit.....AND re-mastered for picture and sound. From all the comments posted here ~ it would be well worth the effort and probably sold out in short order!
3,Please Release Full Version on DVD,I don't like abridged novels and films that are chopped to pieces are in the same category. This shortened version lacks the depth of the original full version film. The full version film should be considered an all time classic.
2,"Hawaii, the Destruction of An Epic","The complete uncut original version of this film is one of my favorites as it was for my late mother. I feel it was one of the greatest film epics Hollywood had produced. The acting was superb. Max Von Sydow is my favorite actor. Julie Andrews was magnificent as well as a little known actress named Jocelyn Lagarde who played the Ali Nui, in fact she was nominated for an academy award. I met Manu Tupou who played Keoki and thanked him for his excellent portrayal.The marriage of film music with the movie by the late Elmer Bernstein was film scoring at its finest. The cinematography was breath taking and the screenplay was witty and engaging. The story albeit a shorter adaption of the mamoth Michener epic novel was nonetheless very poignant. I have the full VHS version. This film was not too long in my book! Why did MGM butcher the DVD version? Is there a way that Amazon can press the powers that be for a complte version of a much maligned masterpiece on DVD?"
3,"Surprise Appearance in ""Hawaii""","During the ship voyage sequence, look closely at the extras playing the passengers. One of them is a very young Bette Midler in what is probably her film debut."
4,Hawaii Video,"This was a great movie, well acted and followed the book fairly well. The movie ended WAY before the book did, but it was a really long book anyway. I enjoyed the movie very much."
3,Problem with cassette one,"Unfortunately, I did not play this movie until last week. Cassette one will not start at the beginning. Otherwise every else is fine."
2,Hawaii LOST!,"As with the other reviews I have read on this DVD version, what a disappointment seeing this film has been. Waiting for years for the DVD to come out and it has lost almost 30 minutes. Missing are the Overture, Entracte and Exit Music but a very crucial confession given by Abner to Jerusha that ends Act 1. It is very unfortunate that I will have to keep the VHS tape which contains the original Widescreen version of the film.Please write to MGM and telll them how diappointed fans of this film are and encourage them to release a Special Edition of this wonderful film. I am a little worried how they will cut the soon to be released titles-Grand Prix and Ryan's Daughter. Just keep your fingers crossed that wiser minds will prevail other than those who chose to release this poor version of a great Film."
5,VERY CLASSIC,"This is a classic that should not be missed. While the movie does not have the expanded visuals like the book, it does show the early years of the settlements of these great islands. The actors chosen for these roles could not have been more perfect. Please take time to enjoy this movie even though there is no CG effects or Blue/Green screen shots or lasers or anything like that, just enjoy."
4,Hawaii,"Item came in very good condition and fast. I bought it as a gift to a friend so don't know if it played well. The content I have seen the movie many years ago and it was a great movie, I hope my friend will like this gift as she recently went to Hawaii to visit her daughter and was interested in the early culture there. Thankyou Amazon, once again a great deal in price and fast delivery."
5,Beautiful,"Incredible scenery, wonderful depiction of Michner's historic epic. Must for your classic CD collection~"
3,Big disappointment,"Finally,MGM brings out Hawaii on dvd and fumbles big time! The sound in MONO? What the fu...? This is just as bad as universal making Jesus Christ Superstar in its lousy 2.0 DD. Both films should be in 5.1. Get with the program Movie studios!"
1,No partial movie for me.,"After reading these reviews, I will not purchase the movieunless/until it is made available in its entirety. I saw itin 1967 and had desired a copy of my own - here's hoping itwill become available."
4,Hawaii,"Max von Sydow pops up again in this story of missionaries who went to Hawaii in the 1820s. It is really the story of his wife, Jerusha, who pines away in the island paradise. Von Sydow took a similar role in The Emigrants, a film in which he again uproots his wife only to see her disintegrate. Von Sydow the missionary is unyielding and out-of-touch. Themes are typical. We watch native Hawaiians suffer as a result of contact with Europeans. I rented this film when I decided to go to Hawaii."
3,Too much gone,"I eagerly awaited the release of Hawaii on DVD - it's one of my all time favorite movies. Like several other reviewers I was dismayed to find out it was about 30 minutes shorter then the VHS version. I was hoping that they had just cut out the long music before the credits and the intermission, but I discovered that they cut out a number of scenes. Most of the deleted scenes are important for the movies flow and for character development.I'm not sure if the DVD is the original theatrical release (which I never saw) or just edited to fit on one DVD. It's sad, but the VHS version is much better then the DVD version. If you've never seen Hawaii by all means get the DVD (it's still a great movie), but if you've ever seen the VHS version you will probably be disappointed."
2,Great Movie but not in his full length,"This is such an excellent movie which I still have on Laserdisk.The Player unfortunally is somewhere in the garage and I hoped that the movie would have been released on DVD in his full length by now.As I can see, this is not the case.Very, very sad."
2,A beautiful epic but has no life in the actors,After reading the so so book i had to see the movie. i can say it's not as good as the book and it suffers some amajor scene changes(mostley becouse the dvd is edited from it's original release). The acting is the downer point all the actors dont have life in there charactors and seem lost in there acting. The movie is beautifully shot and is a grand epic but sadley it's forgetable.
4,Superior Romantic Comedy,"A small movie but a note perfect one. Terrific acting from all 4 leads and a stellar support from Kevin Corrigan as the video guy. I found the core Heche/Keener friendship utterly believable - it's a real pity Holofcener hasn't been able to work more, she showed a great eye and ear here (if I owned a movie studio, I'd offer her a long-term contract to make one of these relatively cheap sorts of movies each year for the next five years - actors crawl over broken glass to do this sort of stuff!). Soundtrack mainly by Billy Bragg is *wonderful*. Maybe Holofcener could entice him to get back to that classic Bragg late 80's guitar sound on some new project?All told, W&T; is much better than, say _Kissing Jessica Stein_ or any of Ed Burns's rom com's: I think it's one of the 3 or 4 best rom com's of the 90's."
1,Walking and Talking,"This was one of the most boring movies I've seen in some time. I couldn't even finish watching it. I guess the title says it all, especially the talking part."
4,"I love this movie, but...","I can't stand Anne Heche. I know this is an earlier film, but that woman irritates me in every single film she is in. I would give this movie 5 stars if she were not it. So, let me talk about the ones who made the movie great Catherine Keener and Liev Schreiber. Their timing together is wonderful and I was far more interested in their relationship than the one Anne Heche was in. Well, I thought Anne's fiance was very nice and well played, but she was in them and, well you get the drift. This movie is funny and very moving. I liked it a lot."
1,Get Something Else,"I just saw this on the Sundance Channel and I have to say that I'd rent another movie if I were you. The characters were all pretty whiny, self-absorbed, immature and just downright unlikeable. The nerdy guy who worked as a clerk in the video store and went to slasher movie conventions seemed like the most together one of the bunch! There was zero laugh-out-loud humor in it, and whatever humor it had was subtle. Very, VERY subtle.Apart from that, whatever tugs on the emotional heartstrings you were supposed to feel for the characters was negated by the simple fact that it's hard to care about characters who are so unattractive. Avoid it."
2,Just OK,"After reading the reviews of Nicole Holofcener's movies, I thought this would be just the type of movies I would love. I purchased 3 of them and I have to say that I somewhat enjoyed them, but not excited enough about them to suggest them to family and friends. Of the 3 I purchased, ""Walking and Talking"", Lovely and Amazing & Friends With Money"", I enjoyed the last one the most. I am looking to selling them after only one use."
1,This Should Be Icluded With The Impact Wrench,"I'm giving this only one star for one simple reason. Milwaukee doesn't include it with the tool for which it is intended. You have to buy the impact wrench and case separately. Furthermore, when you buy the impact wrench at a store, that store doesn't even carry this case. So, until you just happen to accidentally stumble upon this case here on Amazon, like I did, your tool gets dinged up in your job box."
3,Sobre Juampa,"La verdad es que la música no es una maravilla. Todas las canciones se basan en cantar obscenidades. Pero se convirtió en un fenómeno de masas ""el cantor de Cuéllar""No pasa nada por no oir el disco, pero hay que verle en directo, es un descojono.De lo mejor de la era Pre-Tamara"
4,"""The professor offered Arthur a pair of his rectangular goldfish.""","This was a reread for me. I pulled Arthur and Henrietta out of a packing box, and just had to sit down and reread the book. At 92 pages, it's a nice short reread, and still a great deal of fun.Pinkwater was a pretty influential character for me as a kid-- his books were exactly the kind of inspired nonsense that I really enjoyed. A 266 pound chicken terrorizing New Jersey is right up that alley.Recommended for kids and grownups alike."
4,"Fun, fast read!","When Arther Bobowicz is asked to bring home the Thanksgiving turkey,he is horrified to discover the shops are empty. But when he visits the apartment of an eccentric scientist,he finds himself bringing home a 266 pound chicken instead. He insists to his parents he should be able to keep the chicken and eventually,his begging succeeds.He has great fun teaching his chicken new tricks,(such as going down slides,playing on swingsets etc.)but his 266 pound chicken escapes. Mayhem ensues.This book is a fun, fast read for children of all ages to enjoy. While it can be read in one sitting,it should be read at least twice, in order to get all the jokes.RATING:B+"
2,Factually inaccurate,"If I were in Hoboken, having a Chicken Emergency, I wouldn't panic. It is hard to feel empathy for Arthur, the main character in this engaging but factually inaccurate Thanksgiving tale by Daniel Pinkwater, as he bumbles his way from one disaster to another. The premise that not a single shopkeeper in the whole of Hoboken has a turkey in their freezer is, at best, far-fetched. At worst, it is factually inaccurate and a damning incitement on Pinkwater's research whilst writing this book. This reviewer knows for a fact that Sandra D's Mini Mart, 453 5th St, had a freezer full of plump gobblers last Thanksgiving, and had Arthur visited King's Super market, 1212 Hudson St, he'd have found cranberry sauce as well. I'm all for warming, cheery tales of triumph over tragedy, but when they're this sloppy with the detail, they're hard to swallow. My nephew's first comment when he read this book was ""I done a guff"", and, quite frankly, I think that says it all. Disappointing."
5,Chickens Need Our Love!,"The Hoboken Chicken Emergency was a really good book. It is a good book for third grade and up to read on their own. It takes place in Hoboken, New Jersey around Thanksgiving. It's about a boy named Arthur who goes to look for a turkey for Thanksgiving. The problem comes when he can't find one. Instead he ends up getting a 266 pound chicken named Henrietta. Arthur tries to keep the chicken as a pet but it runs away. Henrietta (the chicken) feels unwanted and creates diasters all over town. Read the book to find out what happens next. We thought the book was hilarious, funny, and exciting. We are nine and ten years old and we liked the book alot!"
5,Emilio Estevez Could Be One of the Next Best Directors,This is the best new film that I have seen in the last couple of years. Emilio Estevez may just one of the best new directors that's out there now and I really hope he goes into full time directing. I will be watching this film over and over.
1,"A horrible, wretched film.","Overacted throughout by (first time?) director Estevez, this adaptation is painful viewing; not for any unpleasant insights into the Vietnam experience, but for Estevez screaming at his cowering family for two hours. By the end any sympathy we had for his returning vet is squandered---he deserves worse than what he gets. If only we'd seen something of his recovery, and his redemption. Instead we learn in voice over that he turned up dedication of the Vietnam Veteran's Memorial...probably still screaming at somebody. Bates and Sheen are great with what they are given, as is the radiant but perenially wasted Ms. Williams. A showpiece for Estevez, this film fatally overplays its hand and probably does more harm than good in generating sympathy for Vietnam vets. A mistake."
5,The Movie Composer when he was a Pop Singer,"I bought this album on vinyl in 1975 and on the CD in 2008. This is one of my all time favorite pop albums. It is a fun, sad, moody, uplifting variety of songs. I was a fan of Edelman and Billy Joel as new artists about the same time. Randy's voice is unique. His vocals and piano ensamble hinted at his talents that would be fulfilled by his movie albums such as Gettysburg or DragonHeart, you will love Prime Cuts. My vinyl got lost in a move in 1980, so I was delighted to find the re-release in 2008. It is a bargain at twice the price. If you want cookie cuter music buy something else, but listening to Randy Edelman, Billy Joel and Joni Mitchell got me through a number of lonely nights. Prime Cuts is a little known classic that led to a successful career composing music for film scores."
5,Great,Of course a great album by Dire Straits. Live tracks recorded from 1978 to 1981. On this album we listen to Mark Knopfler and Dire Straits on the beggining of their carrer.
3,Top Heavy,"I found the Integral Map to be interesting and informative. That we are indeed integral beings, each aspect of ourselves overlaps into other dimentions of our human existance.His bottom line of living an integrated life is essentially allthere is after taking away the layers of grids and labels.I felt there was a real lack of depth and areas were touched uponbriefly and then the next item was qued up.I came away with some new insights but in general was very disappointed."
1,More of same with ribbons & bows,"The written material in this you would read in a day and it basically sums up Wilber's ideas succinctly but it is not an enjoyable read. The videos are very poor with Wilber sitting in a chair, usually, pontificating on things. The audio CDs are poorly recorded interviews with Wilber really just being at his repetitious best.I have found some of Wilber's writing interesting. However, I think he has been sucked into Marketingitis. The packaging looks really nice though so nice I gave it to someone as a present. In the last few years Wilber has gone from Wilber 1 - Philosopher to Wilber 2 - ""The Brand"". Not really that much depth after all."
1,Well...,"I tried getting interested in this program, but I couldn't grasp it, and found I didn't want to. I am trying to live in my head less, and my body more, and I don't see this as being conducive to doing so. Now I just want to think of someone I can gift it to."
1,Insults Republicans at Beginning of Video,"I am actually returning this product. After only 5 minutes of the DVD, Wilber insults anyone who is a Republican by basically stating that they do not have the ability to grasp his concepts. What a turnoff. One would think a so called ""enlightened"" person such as Wilber woud embrace all people. But apparently not. I do not support any product that insults any group. Its very narrow minded and petty. I lost interest very quickly. Very disappointed."
4,Music/children - they go together......,"This piano is adorable. My granddaughter is not quite two yet and she plays (bangs on it) daily. I don't mind because I am a firm believer in starting to encourage a child to love music as young as possible. It can enrich their lives beyond belief. I play my big piano and she plays her small one. The color says pink, but actually it is a bit peachey, but nonetheless a great toy for any child to own."
2,good for average do it yourselfer,I am a contractor and thought that this little saw would be great for those little repair jobs and small installs. which it was until i had to cut holes in the center of tiles and found the gaurd was always in the way and a pain to remove. the blade throws water directly at you so you are gauranteed to get wet using this one. buy extra blades since it will use them all if you plan to use it more than a few jobs.wear safety glasses it will throw chips at you! keep it dry when not in use ! all of the metal screws and gaurd arm are not galvinized and will rust quickly. i also found that when you cut that the blade will leave small chips along the cut even with a new blade so try to hide all of your cuts so they dont show. i have owned it for about 4 years now and for 2 it has sat in a corner of my basement getting evil glares. if you can get away with renting one rather than buying this one i would!
3,Excellent for home improvement,"I got this as a gift from my father who also owned one. After going through the rental process a few times I was happy to have my own tile saw, and after 600 sq/ft of tile work over the last 2 years, am just as happy. Sure its messy, the plastic table can cause problems, and sometimes the tile corners break off -- but hey 95% of the cuts are fantastic and you don't have a 12/24 hour rental window to work in. Once you get used to its faults you can work around them and create a professional job. I have cut 17"" tile with this thing (admittedly difficult project) all the way down to 4"" tile. The only warning I have is to periodically loosen and retighten the nut that holds the cutting blade. I waited too long and had the nut ""freeze"" forcing me to destroy the water sealed compartment to get at the motor spindle. A little silicone and I was back in business. This thing is invaluable for the home improvement person looking to save money and get professional results."
4,Plasplugs DWW105USSP Diamond Wheel Tile Cutter,"It really is easy to use. I did not ruin one tile after tiling a 4' x 5' bath and a 10' x 10' kitchen.You do get a bath if you don't use the guard and it is messy. I lay it on a large piece of cardboard in my garage and toss the carboard when done.The one complaint is that the fence worked poorly from the start and eventially broke after moving it a few times. Chunks of tile were getting stuck under it and not allowing it to move or lock down. The plastic piece that locks the fence broke. No big deal, I just use a couple small C-clamps.See how many tiles you ruin with a scoring cutter and tile nippers. I recommend it."
2,Good for small jobs.,"It works effectively. Good for small jobs. With alittle shopping at your local Home Depot or home warehouse and a few bucks more, one could be found that is twice the quality fairly easily."
4,Good for smaller jobs.,"I tiled my whole house using only this saw to cut tile. My bathrooms are done in 12"" ceramic tile. This saw worked great for these jobs. The rest of my house is done in 18"" porcelain tile(much, much harder than ceramic) I went through 2 blades and wore out the seals on the motor saw shaft. The saw is almost dead(leaking water) and had me worried on the last room, but it held out.I recommend a more heavy duty saw for porcelain and big jobs. This saw is very slow in these areas.The positives of this saw are the price, it does work, and the blade is small enough combined with the design of the saw to make cuts out of the middle of tiles to go around walls at door entrances and obstacles. My house looks great, and we saved thousands(yes several thousands) of dollars in labor costs doing it ourselves. The video that comes with the saw is good.5 STARS for small jobs and ceramic tile.3 STARS for big jobs and porcelain tile."
3,saw guide needs some work,the saw it self is fine - the guide will not stay in place. if you purchase this product be ready to use clamps on each end of saw guide to keep in place.
4,The Diamond Wheel Tile Cutter,"This is a basic tile cutter, and it does an excellent job for the ""do-it-yourself"" people. I was favorable impressed with its toughness, even though it looks small, and fragile. It did the job, and didn't cost a fortune."
3,Didn't keep my interest,"This book was OK, but I thought it was an end times book. The first half of the book focused on one event that was not an end times issue, but a catholic one. Then it picked up some in the second half, but merely skimmed over subjects and didn't go into any depth to make you feel the story or understand the characters."
1,Couldn't Wear It.,"I always choose a size small for lingerie outfits like this, but this one runs SO small that I couldn't even pull it up all the way- and I can wear a size 2 in jeans! The fabric is also much rougher than it looks in the picture and I did not recieve the neck piece it says it includes. The gloves are allright though."
4,massage therapist uses this CD,"My husband bought me this CD to use in my practice. It is relaxing and unobtrusive, but not boring. It helps me to concentrate on my client and really enjoy the massage. I especially like the water sounds."
5,Modern Day Red Riding Hood,"Red: Werewolf Hunter is a SyFy movie. It is still a very enjoyable film! A terrific cast including Felicia Day, Kavan Smith, Greg Bryk, and Stephen McHattie each delivered terrific overall performances. The premise was a new take on the Red Riding Hood theme and is really a great idea. The special effects/ CGI were better then the other reviews may have you believe, and fun to watch."
5,GREAT MOVIE,I FIRST SAW THIS MOVIE ON THE SY-FY CHANNEL AND LIKE IT SO MUCH I BOUGHT.IT.HAD TO WAIT FOR ITS RELEASE AND GLAD IT CAME OUT ON DVD.GREAT ENTERTAINMENT...........
2,Things never fine with Fein,"Fein is the Mercedes of toolmakers, with an arrogant take-it-or-leave-it attitude towards their customers that takes the breath away. They find a, for-them, cheap fix for a design flaw of their own making and then sell it without thought at a price of their choosing. The adapter in question, which is NEEDED to prevent certain attachments from wandering around the arbor, REQUIRES a longer Allen screw to attach it than came with the original tool, but this screw is NEITHER PROVIDED with the part NOR SPECIFIED on the packaging. So be prepared for another trip to a well-stocked industrial hardware store and get ready to do some experimenting."
5,makes new star accessories usable on old-style multimasters,"Does exactly what it's supposed to do - makes new star-mount accessories usable on the old-style multimaster. No more slipping! Works great for me with cutting, sanding, and rasp."
4,Good tool for the price,"I got these calipers as a gift. I had been about to buy myself a more expensive pair and was a bit disapointed when I got these knowing it would be rude to not use them. BUT, these things perform pretty well. I've been using mine for about 5 years now. They are not as solid feeling as a set of Starrett's or Mitutoyo's, but they get the job done."
2,Kinda dissapointed,"Received the GENERAL 1436 6-inch Digital calipers for fathers day. Nice setup with the box and all. Opened the packaging and the digital readout wouldn't work so I tried the spare battery that came in the case, NOTHING!!My fiance asked Amazon for a replacement and it was here FAST.Opened the packaging and as before, no digital readout!!!I tried the spare battery in the case and FINALLY a digital readout. So basically 1 battery out of 4 worked so I guess I got screwed out of a spare battery."
4,Effective product,"This cutter is an effective solution for small jobs and repairs. I would not recommend it for a job as large as an entire countertop or floor. You will still need a large wet saw for that type of job. Before you use it, if you're making dry cuts, be ready to experience some extremely high dust volume!My first application was cutting several large granite tiles. These is a very hard material and this saw cut through it easily."
5,Reclaiming Childhood,As a family practice resident I am trained to focus on acute physical ailments. Yet so often parents approach me with concerns about their children's behavior and emotional state. Reclaiming Childhood offers a much needed reminder that scholastic achievement is not the sole indicator of healthy development.
4,Bargello patterns are hard to find!,I looked high and low in local craft and yarn stores for bargello patterns. Non-existent. So glad that I was able to find this book on-line. The patterns are beautiful and the book is in excellent condition (as advertised).
2,Bought TWO and BOTH were broken!,"I bought this clock as a Christmas gift for my husband. Our house is decorated in mid-century modern and this clock is a great/interesting color. However, I somehow ordered two instead of one, but at the time the clock itself was less then $3 dollars, although I paid over $8 for shipping so over $14 total for two clocks. Since the price was so low and the quality of the clock is inexspensive (i.e. I figured it would be good to have a back up in case it broke) I figured I'd keep the extra one. When my husband put batteries in the first one the minute hand 'fell' - it won't stay in place. I thought, good thing I have an extra - but that one has the SAME problem. I am in the process of returning/exchanging BOTH. So, great looking clock although it is inexpensive looking plastic BUT it doesn't work - TWO were broken out of the box!"
5,BEAUTIFUL CD COLLECTION!,AS MOST OF MOZART'S MUSIC THERE ARE A LOT OF JEWELS HERE.SOME WORKS WERE MADE IN MOZARTS BEGINNINGS AS COMPOSER BUT THIS MUSIC IS NOT ONLY FOR COMPLETISTS.
4,good,We live in a rural area and we were having trouble finding this product. That is why we ordered it from you.
2,I expected more from the source,"Training from the source barely scratches the potential of Freehand MX, although it does a good job at getting a user up and running. Power Tips scattered throughout the book are a nice feature, but not much use to a Power User.Since Macromedia has stopped shipping full manuals with Freehand MX, this title suffices as a manual, but not for people who are interested in the inner workings of Freehand, or even ideas on real world usage, and powerful insider tips to using Freehand effectively.The name of the title, ""Training from the source"" just raises your expectations and this book leaves you expecting more."
3,For beginners,"Macromedia Freehand MX, Training from the Source is a basic, yet, complete book for Freehand beginners. Everything you need to know to start an illustration project, either for web or print is in the book. Do not expect advanced techniques, just enough to get your imagination running. Every important tool, special effect, command or action is briefly explained. By the end of the book you WILL know how to use Macromedia Freehand!if you like colored illustrations, the book is not for you. It has basic, right-to-the-point gray scaled illustrations, there are no complicated projects to follow. The projects are simple and, as I established earlier: for beginners."
3,Maddening in places,"I am an intermediate user of Dreamweaver MX 2004 as well as Fireworks and am learning Flash (for which I highly recommend the Hands On Training series) and decided I needed to learn FreeHand MX 2004, the 4th leg of the Studio MX 2004 chair. I bought this book because it was the best rated by Amazon users and I've used Training from the Source before. I was disappointed. In places the book seemed maddening (or maybe it's FreeHand MX 2004 that's maddening) and I had to go over and over some of the bits to figure out what wasn't being said in the text so I could complete the examples. In part, it maybe that the book is based on the Macintosh version (the illustration show Mac windows) and I'm working with the PC software."
3,Freehand Manual,"Found the manual useful; there are just some things you can't figure out on your own. It was in pretty good shape, a little raggedy with, for some reason, a jillion price stickers all over it. Is there a reason you can't put the new sticker over the original for crying out loud? It arrived amazingly fast and I would absolutely go through Amazon for used books again."
3,Stainless color doesn't match appliances.,"So, it fills the gaps just fine. I did not use the adhesive pads because I like to remove the spacers for cleaning. I wish I had bought the black to blend with my granite countertops, rather than the stainless that does not match. Howeve, NO ONE else seems to notice the color difference, or even that they exist. So, I'm just a picky woman."
5,Favorite Foodie Movie even referenced by Chef David Chang!,"I bought this movie over a decade ago (not knowing anything about the DVD) when Blockbuster was selling off some of their used copies of foreign films to make way for newer titles. (This was WAY before they had started closing many of their brick & mortars.) I've considered myself SO very fortunate to have a perfect copy with the original artwork! Top NYC Chef David Chang even mentions it in the very first edition of his ""Lucky Peach"" magazine!Lucky Peach: Issue 1"
1,Overpriced bootleg,"This is an overpriced bootleg copy of the Geneon Japanese Region 2 release, which has English subtitles. If I was looking for a bootleg, I would not pay the exorbitant $18 they're asking for. At this point, one may as well download it from torrents for free and avoid this pirated dvd."
5,The importance of food,"A widow struggles to change her late husband's ramen shop from a dingy hangout for local lowlifes to a top-flight eatery that will have the customers lined up around the corner. A truck driver takes a break from his travels and assembles a posse of experts to help her. Along the way, we are treated to a number of entertaining and enlightening vignettes about the various roles that food plays in all our lives. The satire in this film is far more gentle than it is in some of director Juzo Itami's other films, but it hits its mark unerringly. Those who have not spent time in Japan may be puzzled by a few scenes."
4,Great Movie! Quirky and Fun,"I originally saw this movie in college and had to have it for my own. If found the main plot to be entertaining, funny and touching. The subplot, well, it is hard to explain - and really gives the movie a strange twist which is unrelated to the main plot.I think this is a cult classic type movie, and find it hard to convince people to watch it with me. Once they do, they enjoy it - and ask what the heck the subplot meant!The DVD is a standard presention, nothing special. I am moving over to DVDs mostly for storage right now, and do not have the needed equipment to measure the quality for review."
5,A feast of a movie!,"I first owned this on laser disk (The Beta-Max of DVD formats..)This movie is excellent. It's a comedy and a study of howpeople relate to food in so many, many different ways. I can'tthink of a single person who wouldn't love this film."
4,TAMPOPO - A subtitled foreign film you wil love and understand,"I originally saw Tampopo in an art film theater perhaps 30 years ago. It takes plaace in Japan and involves a widow, her young son, her noodle shop and the people she meets who befriend her and help her to gain self respect, happiness and success. It is also about food and what it means to different people. I have a VCR version which is far inferior to the DVD I just purchased. It is a film you wil be pleased to make a part of your library"
4,Tampopo is delightfully funny,"This film is likely what a Mel Brooks comedy about food would be--if he was Japanese. There are short single scenes or sketches throughout the film relating to food (including a sex scene where food is almost the third partner) held together by a charming main storyline about a trucker who leads the widowed owner of a failing ramen shop on a quest to learn how to make the best ramen in Japan. This main storyline was also the inspiration for the equally charming 2009 US film ""Ramen Girl."""
5,"An intoxicating wold of love,crime,and ramen","Tampopo is a wonderful film for many audiences. Not for the easily offended, nor people who despise subtitles. This film bring character to a tradation of Japanese Ramen, off color humor, and Mel Brooks like antics including the little things you miss until the third watching. Definately a must see for the humorist, and a must watch for a culturalist."
5,The Masterpiece of a late legend!,"This film, like all Juzo Itami's films is extremely well researched, funny, fast paced and explores its subject to great depths - this one being about food and the natural human desire to make, serve and eat the best dishes possible. The underlying story between the lines is food's connection to the erotic and egotistical sides of human nature.Very well made and fantastically well acted by the whole cast but this is especially true of star and real life widow, (Nobuko Miyamoto), of the late Director who at the peak of is his career commited sucide by jumping for the roof of his offices for no apparent reason.This considered, although the film world has lost a great talent, Mr. Itami's suicide is just more evidence of the draw backs and pluses associated to somone who posseses that caliber of genius mind."
4,A great comedy,"A very enjoyable movie, I would rate it a 4. Well done and the caracters are beleivable. An asset to my movie colllection."
5,The Robinson fable,"If I had to choose ONE film to take it with me to a desert island, this would be the one. Since the first time I saw it, in a little cinema in Paris, I have enjoyed as much every single time I had the occasion to see it again. The film is perfuct, funny, touching, intelligent - I would just wish that the technical quality of the picture would be better. Then I would not only see the film; I would eat it as well."
1,Tampopo,"I was looking forward to watching this movie when, to my utter surprise (and not in a good way!), it had no English sub-titles. I don't speak, or understand, Japanese. I think they should let you know, in writing, that there are no English sub-titles on foreign films. I returned it and, yes, it was open but how else do you watch a DVD without opening it - and I am expecting a full credit...unless there is a version with English sub-titles, then I will accept an exchange."
4,From the surreal to the bizarre: food in Japan.,"I bought Tampopo solely on the strength of the very positive reviews it got here. I'm not sorry I bought it. It was enjoyable watching and it's the kind of movie I'll watch a few times over time.This is a funny movie but more bizarre than I expected. It was surreal enough so that one does not come away from it feeling that an insight into Japanese culture has been gained. In fact, I'd always wanted to visit Japan one day. Now I'm not so hot the idea.I'll give Tampopo a 4 star review because it was a fun movie, a movie with some ""intellectual"" appeal, and because it was so completely different than any other movie I've ever seen. If you're considering purchasing Tampopo, go for it."
3,Eating and sleep!,It is not really funny or sexy at all. If you like cooking it gives you some hints about the Japanese kitchen. The DVD is not value for money.
1,Not for you.,"This movie is based on a silly plot about ramen which could have been written by any 13 year old boy. Lots of meaningless and boring scenes about people who never become a part of the overall storyline. Random sequences of trite and pointless food discussions abound. Only very eccentric and oddball characters truly seem to like this movie, otherwise this is probably... not for you. If you are looking for funny, humorous, light-hearted, personality-driven characters, stick to Mel Brooks and Adam Sandler. You'll definitely be happier."
5,Mmmmmmmmmm . . .,One of my favorite movies. It alway makes me want to eat noodles. This is a good DVD transfer for the price. The last one I saw was $125.00. This copy also arrived pretty quick.
5,TAMpopo!,"It's a fun and soulful look into the influence of food in Japanese society...especially their noodles. Lot's of stories weaved together, (including one in the style of a western, and one in the style of a 'Mafioso' getting his 'just deserts') for one message! I always enjoy seeing this film, and in the end, I'm always full!"
4,A sweet and sly little gem,"I give this film 4 1/2 stars, but there are no halves in the Amazon.com rating system. This is an engaging comedy that takes a simple story line and peppers it with likable, interesting characters and a fair amount of observational wit. Along the way are several side stories that don't intersect with the main plot but which collectively underscore the importance of the food culture in Japan. There's also a nice hat tip to the silent films to boot. Tsutomu Yamazaki brings a John Wayne-like confidence to his starring role and Nobuko Miyamoto plays the widow with a subtle dignity worthy of Lubitsch. My only complaint is with the DVD transfer: It doesn't have the clarity you expect; it seemed no better than watching the film on videotape. But it is in widescreen, which is a plus."
4,A REALY GOOD THRASHY PUNK ALBUM!,"Firstly, you must ignore all the one star reveiws here.I picked this lil' punk treat up at a sale having only heard the song Step Down. Once played I wasn't dissapionted. Scratch the Surface, Step Down, Insurrection, and Consume stand out as my favorites, Step Down is perhaps the best track. It's a real track to get ya riled. This is good hard (New York) style punk from the mid 90s. Listening to it ya can smell the mosh-pits, the sweat and frenzied throng. Don't look for deep meanings in the lyrics, it's a punk album to get ya real amped."
5,Great Album...,"This is incredible. Pure adrenaline with tons of heart, talent anddedication. My favourites on this album are definitely ""Goatless""and ""Cease Fire"". You can't go wrong with Sick Of It All."
5,"Great Album, for those who are stronger than the weak American Idol fans","""Scratch the Surface"" is a great album. I still like ""Blood, Sweat, and no Tears"" the best but that one is tough to beat. If you want some good rough music try this.... if you want to listen to some weak trash, than watch American Idol."
2,Disappointed,"I bought this lens for my Cannon XSI and was disappointed. Lots of blur in low light settings with no image stability (IS) capability. It has a built in autofocus (AF) which locks the lens from manual focus and does a poor job snapping to focus. This lens would work for someone who is using a DSLR for the first time and is looking for something cheap to throw on, but you will probably pick up on its limitations quickly. Easy to use, good to learn on. I would recommend putting in another $40 and going with the Cannon 18-55mm f/ 3.5 - 5.6 IS (comes with the kit) for a higher quality picture instead."
5,Joselito!,I was thrilled to know this was available on CD! I grew up listening to Joselito!I saw him perform three times! My sisters and I were in love with him!He is the best! The CD is great!
1,Won't stay in place,"This would stay ""stuck"" for the life of me...I finally threw it away after having to restick it every two minutes... it was becoming a driving hazard.Also, too large. Pen slid out all the time too so that was always on the floor and rolling under the seat.Do Not buy this product."
1,Worst I have ever used,Perhaps others don't live in hot places like Texas but all of my clips here melted in the summer rendering them useless.
3,the suction cups don't work,"nice idea, but the suction cups don't work, this now slides around on my dash board but at least I have a piace to write notes. Don't plan on it staying up!"
5,arrived as expected,"The picture is a bit misleading as the item doesn't look like the 2"" wide tape, but it arrived and was indeed 2"" wide tape. I use this for taping my mouth shut during CPAP therapy overnight. For non-CPAP people that will sound weird, but CPAP using mouth breathers will know what I'm talking about."
3,Was OK.,I bought this tape for an abdominal dressing which had to be changed daily for 3 months. Product is more reliable than what is normally available at your local drug store. If you are looking for a medical tape that is comfortable and has superior adhesive qualities try Hypafix tape. It is available on Amazon but is a bit pricier regular tape. Well worth the price though.
5,3M Micropore Paper Tape,"This size tape works really well. I like it because I can cover large areas, or cut it up into different sized strips and patches to cover various smaller areas. It's reasonably durable, and I can often use a piece several times until it no longer sticks well to the skin."
3,"boring, but okay","boring, but okay, that is how i recommend this cd to you. I cannot tell you what this music sounds like, because i do not understand."
3,The adhesiveness is not up to par,"I bought this Post It because I was drawn by the easy-on-the-eyes, pastel colors. Even though the colors are wonderful, I expected its adhesiveness to be strong. At least strong to what I'm accustomed to by the Post It brand. So far I've experienced two of my Post Its fall off from two different places in less than a week. I've had other Post Its that have remained tacked for several months. I don't particularly recommend this specific Post It."
5,Post-it Notes - a technology wonder,"Don't know how we all lived without Post-it Notes! Of course, my office experience started when we still had to use carbon paper to get copies of our typed documents."
4,Phish- IT,"Good DVD/Movie. Viewer need not know a lot about the band. Kind of short. Would have loved to see more behind-the-scenes footage. Irritating at times how the band interviews cut into songs. Overall, good DVD."
2,What the hell is this?,"Be warned...this dvd doesn't even include whole songs! Obviously the director learned nothing from the great rock concert docs of the past (Last Waltz, Gimme Shelter, The Wall Live, etc.). This is essentially various songs (heavily edited) interspersed with talking head interviews with the band. I would rather see/hear 3 or 4 songs in their entirety than just snippets of 10. And what the hell is with the slo-mo, zoom, out-of-focus, shots throughout. A great band doesn't need effects, just put the camera on 'em and record. THAT'S IT. On the plus side, the photography is breathtaking and the picture quality is A+. Overall it's worth it as a document of a HUGELY underrated band and their last great big show (before 2004 where they essentially became parodies of themselves)."
5,This is a Great DVD,"I watched this last month as it was shown on WTTW out of Chicago. This is wonderful. I wasn't at the show, but to see the Tower Jam was awesome. This is a must have for us collectors. You'll love this. Put it in the DVD player and crank up the surround sound. Top Notch Quality audio and visual.Pharewell Boys.JD"
5,Buy this DVD,"Having been at IT, it was great to relive those moments. Also, anybody who was not at the festival will surely be blown away by these boys playing at the top of their game. The only complaint that I have is that of the sound and picture on ""Seven Below"" on the second disc. Both the sound and picture are out of sinc by about 5 seconds. I know other people who have bought the dvd and their copy contained the same problem, so it's not just my copy. Aside from that, this is everything anybody could ever ask for in a Phish video."
4,diamond saw blade,"I purchased this item as a replacement. It is from the same manufacture so I know it will fit. The blade cuts good. I sawed about sixty 12"" terra-cotta tile and used only half of the blades life."
4,A complement to the manual,"I purchased this book several weeks ago after getting my new Nikon D70s and I, personally, think it's a great complement to the camera's manual. Yes, it does cover many of the same topics as the manual (in fact, as I flip through it, I usually have the manual close by), but it's a bit easier to read and uses language that us amateurs (who are new to the DSLR world) would find very useful, epecially when trying to navigate the technical specs of the camera.I probably wouldn't recommend this book to the veteran Nikon user (it may be a bit too redundant), but if the D70s is your first DSLR, I certainly think it's worth the money if you're serious about really understanding the D70s and what it can do."
4,Very good book,In spite of the several negative reviews I read here (mainly saying this book contains only that which is found in the product manual) I appreciated the subject matter being presented in a very consecutive and logical manner - so much better than the product manual. This little book IS worth buying.
2,"Thin, Thin, Thin","I had purchased a MLG for Nikon D90 and was very impressed with the detail and depth of the information. Great info on what lenses do what, what settings to try where ans all around a great addition to my camera that I eventually bought.I already had a D70s and thought ""might as well get an MLG for it too"". What a disappointment. not as good as the Nikon manual that came with the camera. A complete waste of money.I do not recommend buying this unless you can't find a Nikon manual for your D70/D70s."
1,A waste of my time and money,"I was fortunate enough to be given a Nikon 70s by a good friend who was upgrading to a higher megapixel Nikon. I bought this book hoping that it would clarify the owner's manual. What a disappointment. For a beginning amateur the book is nothing more than poorly done rehash of the owner's manual and just as difficult to understand. The type and layout of information is amateurish, jerky and abbreviated as though the author is trying to save on words and the publisher trying to save on paper. Where's the good editor? There are no clear explanations for a neophyte who is unfamiliar with photographic lingo and techniques. I put the book away at the bottom of a drawer. Save your money and and lots of frustration."
2,Owner's manual in new covers,"I was somewhat disappointed to this book as it seemed to be an expanded version of owner's manual only in new covers. Additionally, all pictures are in black-and-white! You may manage without this guide by just using the manual that came along with the camera. This guide although gives you some good hints every now and then, so it might be a practical addition to the official guide. You may findNikon D70 Digital Field Guideeven more interesting."
3,"Corny, but my dad liked it","Bought this as a present for my father who likes movies about overly large animals wreaking havoc. It was corny beyond belief, even he thought so, but really, were you expecting anything else? You get exactly what the movie advertises, and in that respect it is not a disappointment."
2,twisted,Same as Moby Dick only on land. They hardly changed the story at all. It's kind of a rip-off actually.
1,A Stupid Idea,"OK, I should have known that the idea for this movie wasn't much. But then, even I was surprised at how shallow and stupid it turned out to be. Maybe they showed how the vehicle that had traveled through the snow, but I must have missed. Rent or buy this if you must but don't expect much... actually I would expect less than that."
4,Age of the Dragons,Not the greatest movie ever made but entertaining all the same. The Cg of the dragon and flight were good. Danny Glover not to bad. 4 Stars for him. For the price not a bad movie to buy and it is entertaining. But don't expect top of the line movie making and acting.
2,Absolute crappola,"I can't believe an actor like Danny Glover would lower himself to act in this piece of tripe. Not the least exciting, scary; acting was deplorable, and found myself rooting for the dragons. Don't waste your time or money."
4,great suspensful reading,I just picked up this book a few days ago and I couldn't put it down. Very suspensful with a lot of twists!!Excellent reading!
4,Unpredictable,I wanted to read a book from an author that I've never read before. I picked this book up at the library and I'm glad that I did. This is book with lots of twists and turns. I just couldn't figure out the ending (which is a good thing!). There's also a psychological theme to the book as well. Read it and I don't think you'll be disappointed.
2,Very unusual Mary Marie,"Wow! I have seen some ""different"" movies in my life but I did not get into this movie at all. Strange enough about the two sisters falling in love but I didn't even get far enough into this film to see any thing happen between them. Bad acting makes for a bad movie in my eyes."
1,No truth in this One,Very little content on any cure of toe nail fungus.A little book with a big price tag.Author mentions a disinfectant powder and salve to be used but never says what brand or how to make it.
