2,Disappointing,"My friends read this book sayin' it was hot, so I read it. There was some good situations in it, but some were corny as hell. Throughout the book different women used the same positions, no there wasn't no new imaginative things happening."
2,disappointing and repetitive,"I think my ""title"" sums up my review.I had high hopes after reading other reviews of this book.As I read the different stories I found them to be NOT different but the same stories rehashed over and over again. The descriptions where weak and very often repetitive, a broader use of adjectives and adverbs might possible help to improve these stories. The writer's need to end her stories with a ""happily ever after"" cliche' was tired and trite. Overall I found this book to be a very disappointing read."
1,Boring and Repetative,"The settings of the stories change but actions are the same. Once you've read the first few stories there's no need to read any further. Not worth the money, in fact I'm returning my copy."
1,Badly written tripe!,"I think that the existence of this book is evidence that anyone can publish a book and that more women need to be writing erotica.I have read better erotic stories in chat rooms. I was hoping to read articulate, well-drafted, passion-evoking stories and ended up reading bad English, misused words and boring, trite stories.I challenge the publishers of Zane's books to locate female writers like me, and many others, that can actually boil readers from the inside with decent English and a colorful, broad vocabulary.Women need to write more, read more and explore more of their sexuality. This book is not the way to start. I am appalled by the number of people that find this work stimulating.Ladies, write you own passion. Be creative and honest.Anna"
1,Porn in Print???,"I'm sorry but this is was disgusting, No plot, No real dialouge, No depth, just trashy and distasteful. I'm still trying to figure out what the hype is about. I didn't even have the nerve to finish. All I have to say is, this is not satisfying literature at all. U R ABSOLUTELY HORRIBLE ZANE!!!"
1,What a dissappointment,"I've always heard of Zane and how hot her books are, so I thought I'd start with one that was supposed to be one of her best. I'm sorry to say that I don't see what all the hype is about. Her sex scenes are bland and disappointing, and every other word is a curse. I wouldn't mind the cursing if her stories weren't so stale. Her books are one of the few that I did not even bother to finish. If you want Erotica, try Lora Leigh or Jade Black, but skip this author."
3,good but not what I was anticipating,"Zane definitely has a way of turning up the heat with her words and erotic stories but not knowing about this book other than is was erotic based, I thought it was more of a novel or one story in whole.. when its actually many many short stories 3-5 pages or so each of different couples, scenarios, and after a while it became repetitive to where I could anticipate what she was going to write... i much prefer E.Lynn Harris or Carl Weber or Eric Jerome Dickey style books. This book is good for a quick read of a few pages to get you going, mentally or physically."
2,Same sexual words and actions in almost every story,"I like Zane as a writer up until I read this book. I mean she did her thang in ""Addicted"" and ""Shame on it All!"" You would expect more of her but reading Sex chronicles makes me not wanna read anymore sex scenes in any future books of hers simply because she talks about the same stuff. I thought I was in for a ride in a Bentley but unfortunately I realized I haven't left the bus yet! She uses the same words like ""suckle"" and ""baby fine hair"" I just felt like saying ""ZANE CAN YOU THINK OF SOME NEW STUFF!!"".Before I read this book I was anxious to read PartII but now I will save my energy and money for another one."
5,Say What?,"When my boyfriend first came home and handed me this book, I didn't know what to think. I remember the night clearly. I was sitting there with a bowl of cookies and cream ice cream. Well, I started reading and not only did the ice cream melt but so did I. This book is HOTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTT! I had never read any erotica but I love me some erotica now. At least, Zane's erotica. After I finished The Sex Chronicles, I went out and bought a couple of other erotica books and they were laughable compared to this one. They need to get Zane to help them make their books more interesting. For real though."
2,Repetitive,"This book is horribly explicit. It's not vulgar in the way most erotica books are. It's vulgar to the point were it becomes nasty. I read the first four stories that are in the first section and they became redundant. First of all, the stories are only about 4-5 pages long and they elaborate on the sex and then rush through all other aspects of the story.The main plots of each story are exactly the same. Instead of mixing up the sexual experiences, the characters are basically having sex in the same way but in different scenarios. Please...if you want to read this book, borrow it. DON'T BUY IT!"
1,Garbage!,"I bought this on the strength of reviews here. What a mistake! I now believe those reviews were put up here by the publisher.My wife took a look at it first and put it down right away. So I picked it up and I could see why she had dropped it. Very simply - it sucks! I have read a good deal of porn in my time and this is some of the worst I have ever read. It is concrete, clunky, prosaic, with zero style and zero sense of time and pace. In a word it is *mechanical*. There is not a whiff of the erotic anywhere. Find something else - trust me. You could buy pay close to nothing on a secondhand bookstall and do *way* better than this - in fact, if you didn't, you could consider yourself extremely unlucky!Check out the number that are available secondhand and the prices they go for - this is not a book people keep - those numbers never lie, unlike some reviewers.RegardsAdrian"
2,Where shall I begin?,"A member of our book club just kept ranting and raving over how great this author Zane is. So I went purchased the book. Silly me!It does not take a lot to wonder why this author remains anonymous.Like most readers, I enjoy a well-placed, creatively described sex scene in any book. In this book, the sex scenes were like what a child might write on the bathroom wall in an elementary school. Really! I mean this book isn't good enough to be called porn or erotica.Also, it doesn't take a lot of imagination to figure out that this author is a MALE! Yep, that's right! I just ""know"" Zane is a man. Messing with the small minds of sexually deprived, Waiting-To-Exhale sistahs! The author is smart because he (oops, I mean) she is making a fortune.This will be the last book I ever purchase or read by Zane or any other author in hiding."
1,TO MUCH!,"I COULDNT GET PAST THE SECOND STORY DUE TO ALL DA FREAKY THINGS THAT WENT ON IN THIS BOOK, HOWEVER IF U INTO SEX THIS IS THE BOOK FOR YA. I JUST WAS SHYING AWAY FROM THE BOOK AND DIDNT WANT ANYBODY TO SEE ME READING IT, THATS HOW WILD THE BOOK WAS.. ZANE BOOKS I WILL NEVER PURSHASE AGAIN."
1,Can I give this less than one star?,"I got this as a gift (White Elephant type). I reviewed it on Amazon that very day, and they wouldn't publish my review. Let me try to be more delicate this time...Gaaak. This author sucks. Terrible, brainless untalented garbage."
2,"Honestly,","I couldn't finish the book. Zane's way of writing is just not my style. I bought this book thinking that there would be a little bit more of a story to it, but I guess I shouldn't have looked into that. The title is a pure definition of what the book is - just a bunch of short erotica stories.I feel I cannot judge this book or the author on a large scale because I did not finish it. The book didn't hold my interest -- I prefer more of a story to go along with steamy scenes."
2,Not what I expected,"I have much respect for Zane but I have to admit...yikes...I wasn't at all impressed with this book. Somehow it reminded me more of amateur porn than good erotica. This is the first book I've read by Zane and I guess I expected her to be more imaginative. I returned the book...not for me. I must give her due credit though, she surely does shatter the myth."
4,This book will definitely keep your attention.,"This book is an interesting read. If you like erotica, then this is for you. I loved this book. You'll definitely want to keep reading on and on and on! But you will notice (I'm sure that I'm not the first person who reviewed this book to say this) that as the book goes on, it gets a little redundant. How many times can the taste of some YOU KNOW WHAT be delectable anyway? Basically as you move on through the book the excitment of wears off."
3,Oh well,"I really liked Zane's novel ""Addicted,"" so I decided I would give this book a try. Much to my chagrin, it was rather blah. As I read many of the short stories, I found myself guessing (correctly) the outcomes to the stories. In my opinion, that is not a good sign. So while at first I may have been into the stories, I soon grew tired of them and retired the book shortly after starting it."
3,A Let Down,"Okay, let me start off by saying that I am not a prude, but I was more than a little disappointed when I read this book. I think my disapointment might be due to the fact that I had heard so much hype about the book. Friends telling me ""Girl, read this book when your with you man because it's HOT!"" Yes some of the stories are very hot, but some of the aren't. The opening story, to me, is the best one in the book. I think every woman in the world would love for her first time with a new lover to me with a man like the one described in the story. But the story about the woman, her lover, and a turkey leg is just down right tacky. I expect to see that kind of story in Penthouse Letters right next to a letter about sex with amputees. Oh, and the whole sexual sorority thing, that was a let down too. If this book has been hyped up to you, then read it with low expectations. If this is your first time reading erotica then this is a good beginner book."
4,Too Hot To Handlel,"I just recently received this book and, the first time i started reading this book i was at the hair shop,getting my hair braided.And it was just too hot for the spot i was in.I couldn't wait to get home to my partner.This book is a must read for sure.This book is great for couples or single."
5,Sensuality at it's best!,"While not the biggest fan of erotica in the past, having read a few of the other erotica books on the market only to be left disappointed, I felt compelled to read The Sex Chronicles: Shattering the Myth because I have become a huge fan of Zane through her newsletters over the past two years. The other erotic writers out there only scratch the surface. Zane takes erotic fiction to an entirely different level. Her characters are vibrant, the situations are real and the stories are sensual. Some of the stories were so engaging that I could barely sit in my seat without squirming and others were so funny that I couldn't control my laughter. Every last one of the stories stirred something inside of me and I have never had a book do that to me before. The sister is truly talented and I would encourage anyone, no matter what your sex or race, to pick this book up with a quickness. Zane is destined for greatness and I can't wait to see what she writes next."
3,"It was ok,","I like books with good story lines and I dont think this one was all that great. If you're looking for a book thats vulgar and contains profanity, oh yeah this is the one. But for a good read and romance, stick with the library books."
1,FAR,NOT AS GOOD AS I HAVE READ IN THE PAST FROM ZANE. IT IS A WILD BOOK BUT STILL HAS UNDERTONES OFTHIS CITIZENS THAT I THOUGHT WERE NOT UP TO PAR FOR THE CIVIAL RATES AN EDUCATION LEVEL OFTHIS GREAT GROUP OF PEOPLE. I COULD BE DEAD WRONG
1,Trivial at best...ugh!!,"I am so dissapointed in this book. I've heard for years how fabulous Zane and her writing was but I must say, if I wanted straight porn, I'd rent it on tv. No real storylines. It was just awful. I couldn't even make myself finish the entire book. After about 3 stories...I'd had enough and the entire book went into the archive files. Hate I spent my money. It should have been on the $.99 shelf...definitely not worth more than that."
2,Not Addicted to Sex Chronicles,"I really like Zane - I couldn't put Addicted down to save my life!!! So based on that, I bought Sex Chronicles I and II- no questions asked. I love good erotica, and while this was definitely freaky, it didn't really do it for me. It was so repetitive, sometimes unimaginative, and I couldn't even bring myself to get even halfway through it. You don't get to know the characters - each story is like "" we met...we hit...now we're engaged"" ,or something like that, crammed into a few pages. Short isn't always sweet!"
2,Never Again,"I will never again buy a book by Zane. The writing was poor, and the stories were not creative. I was let down. Out of the 40 short stories, I enjoyed about three of them. I do commend her for writing about Black Eroticism so boldly, but she needs a new editor - at the least."
3,Not Complaining,"Ok, SO this book was good, I must admit some stories were very similar and some ridiculous but for the most part this book was alright. I wouldn't read it again some stories might worth reenacting, so I'll keep it around."
3,The Sex Chronicles : Shattering the Myth,It was ok. The stories are all vary similar in nature in the way they are written. Not much creative thought.
3,it was aiight,This is her first of two chronicles and I found it to be a bit slow. And I didn't see nothing too much hot about it except about 3 or 4 stories. Just wasn't all good to me.
4,HOTT!!!,I only have one word for this book and its the same one I said in the title LOL this book was extremely hot...Read with extreme caution and make sure your ready to go into deep detail because Zane nailed it on this one...the last book I read by her wasn't as deep as this one and this one took me on a definite whirlwind I wish I had a man....I would recommend this book to anyone but you must be ready LOL I am not trying to sound too extreme but I'm serious I loved it but but it got HOTT!!!!
3,Umph,"I thought Sex Chronicles was going to be a typical book about some friends and their sex lives, but instead I got a bunch of sex stories. I'm not mad at that, but they just didn't thrill me. I like Zane, but the stories were repetitive. She also tacked on fairytale endings that were not needed. Borrow it, if you really want to read it, because you probably won't be reading it again."
1,Not Impressed,"This is the first book by Zane that I have read and I must say that she is not as imaginative as I expected. After reading the first story ""First Night"", I almost put the book down because I was neither impressed with the writing style nor the sex descriptions. They were both so ordinary! I hoped it would get better as I continued reading, but after the fourth story, the sex descriptions became overly repetitious and the supporting imagery did not help much. I must say that my imaginations are a lot more fun & creative. I was not impressed with the book at all and I have returned it."
5,More Black Erotica Please!,"We need more publications of erotica for people of color, particulary African-Americans. Zane's erotic literature is an eye-opener to exploring the sexual side of the reader and at the same time, keeping him/her immersed. I hope to see more black authors write as candidly about sex as Zane."
4,Great...but...,"I loved this book. It had lots and lots of adventures and it was a real page turner. But, I hated seeing the same words and phrases over and over such as ""suckle"" and ""long black hair."" And, all of the men that she met seemed to have bald heads and they were dark skinned! Let's get some diversity up in this piece! After a while it got old. But other than that, it ws worth the $... that I spent on it."
3,Sexy,"These stories were hot, although some were redundant and over the top. Overall they were spicy."
5,GREAT READ,I LOVE THIS BOOK THAT'S ALL I CAN SAY. THIS BOOK IS A MUST READ FOR REAL. KEEP IT AT YOUR BED SIDE. I LOVE HOW ZANE EXPRESSES HER MIND IN THESE SHORT STORIES. I LOVE THIS BOOK TO DEATH. GREAT READ.
1,SHATTERED SAGA,"Erotica is written to entice and invite, this was obscenely vulgar. It says to read with a partner; not at all this is outrageous. I am not shy and enjoy being risque but this is trashy as hell. I was caught by Zane's Addicted, she did an okay job in that but this no.....this is horrible."
4,"No rips, tears, etc. A little pixelated","For the money it's a great buy. It's an image probably made for a smaller poster, and blown up to 24x36 as you can see by the blockiness. But it still looks great from a foot or two away. Fast shipping and well packaged."
3,Wanted Oldies!,I was expecting a better variety of songs.Disappointed in the ASL words chosen forsigning. Good points though for exposureto signing.
3,with heart and hands and voice,This is a nice little book. Had good information for signing songs. The songs were easy to sign. The pictures were easy to understand.
5,Must have CD for any jazz piano enthusiast,"I am a jazz pianist myself and think that this is some of the most superb piano playing I have ever heard. It is highly recommended - showing incredible imagination, musical sophistication, technique and most importantly beautiful emotion. A must have addition to any collection."
5,What do you think you're buying?,"HELLO! You're buying factory rejects, and you're complaining about the variety in your order? This is how the company gets rid of the imperfect candy that comes off the line...they don't care whether you're satisfied with it or not! In fact, it would be thrown away if they didn't have suckers like you to pay for it! GEESH!"
3,Product OK,The Hodgepodge is alright. I put the whole bag out for Christmas and it was gone. The candy in the bag was a little weird. I got a lot of Licorice gummy bears and cherry lips. Must be Valentines candy. It was fresh candy and quite a mix of things. I wanted some sunkiss jellys but did not get any of those. We prefer the Jelly Belly mix but the company was out of those bags.
2,Hodgepodge,I was a little disappointed with the selection included in the Hodgepodge 2.5 pound bag. There was not as great of a variety as I had expected and the product didn't really seem worth the money that I spent on it. The products were okay--just not a spectacular buy for the money.
3,Very Fresh but not much variety,I expected more choices in the bag. What was in there was fruit gems and jelly beans and the dinasour things that were just plain nasty....they tated like citronella. My 4 bags ordered were all exactly the same.
3,Okay,"Half of the fun is the anticipation of what you'll get! In my package, 80% were the cheap jelly beans, with the 20% being fruit gems, gummy hearts and a few gummy pieces. I am glad that I did this once, it was fun. The candy is delicious, but I'm not a fan of the cheap jelly beans."
5,Jelly Belly Hodgepodge,What a great product!!! If you are a fan (as I am) of Jelly Belly candy this this is for you. These are rejects but taste just as good (if not better because of the cost). Lots of variety.
4,"Ordered it one day, turns to fruit gem hodgepodge the next.","I ordered the hodgepodge one day, only to check back on the item the next day and notice that it has turned into fruit gem hodgepodge. I guess they added the disclaimer that most of your order would be fruit gems. When I got my order, it was mostly fruit gems and other ""gummy"" candies. They kind of looked like deformed swedish fish. Wasn't a big fan, but I guess it is a gamble."
2,Not what we expected,"We recieved a 2.5 pound bag 90% FULL of sunkist gems (mostly orange) and easter jelly beans tossed in the mix and that was it!! Another waste of time and money, we won't be ordering this again."
3,Who remixed this!?! Yuck!,"I got the original Jumpin' The Gunne album back when it came out. Over the years, it's remained one of my favorites. I bought this CD to replace my old LP, as I don't have the time or space to mess around with vinyl anymore (to my deep regret).Somewhere along the way, somebody remixed the album, to the point of adding in vocals that were never there before. Organ parts are now covered up by the piano. Matt Andes' guitars really suffer. I suppose whoever did it thought they were cleaning it up and updating to 2004 standards, but it's to squeeky-clean and it's lost all the funk. It's very distracting to listen to after having committed the vinyl version to memory over the span of thirty years.Anybody know where I can get a CD of the original LP?"
2,Real Biker Rock to Candy StreetCar Rock,"Why did Jo Jo Gunne tail off in popularity following their first big release with the hit Run,Run,Run? Hard rock bands really liked the sound of that hit and those type of guys were the folks that really supported it. Some of the other songs on that album rocked, but from there the band adopted more of a pop,southern california teenybopper sound rather than the tougher hard-driving sound from RunRunRun. There were exceptions but Jo Jo lost it's focus on the more serious sounds. I mean bikers dug ""Run"" but they couldn't hang with much of the rest Jo Jo Gunne put out. Sure it rocked, but it was candy rock as opposed to the real gritty stuff."
2,eh..,"These snapped pretty easily, but they did as they advertise. They are just basic clear straps. After they snapped I gave them to my cat as a toy."
1,MISSING ITEM!!!,My wife ordered TWO sets of these and only received one and can find nobody to report this to.
3,could've been EMF?,"It's funny how the music industry works. Some bands get record company backing, some don't. I guess it's the way of the world, who you know, whatever. Listening to this album, I'm instantly back in 1990. These guys are like an english BoDeans. Their sound is processed, their songs are formulatic, their lyrics are far from profound, but realistically, this isn't a bad record, all told.Nelson has a whiny voice reminicent of EMF's James Atkin, with nods to Modern English, the Cure and the Replacements(!). As you listen, think ""could these guys have been EMF?"" See if you don't find yourself wondering: ""If the rock music world worked like the country music world and performers were searching for songs that fit their ""sound"", could I hear U2 playing ""Nationality""? The Goo Goo Dolls could be playing ""Never Come Down Again""?Take a chance on this album. It's a good change of pace."
4,Class Act,"My view on this release is that it was just a great thing for Andy Powell to do. And it is done so well, a great production. The sound is excellent and the video is very well shot and edited. Andy Powell is a class act. He just keeps rolling along. I also have to commend Martin Turner, Ted Turner and Steve Upton for allowing Wishbone Ash to continue. These guys are all very cool. Some people may take issue with the fact that the band only has one original member, so this DVD is not for the purist or the uptight. It's is for the fans who love to see this music kept alive and performed live. It is great to see Laurie Wisefield again. Overall a very enjoyable DVD. Well worth the money."
5,Straight ROCK ...Straight in the face,"Classic rock though classic has not faded away. Whenever the twin guitars roar , it raises its head and punches the neorock in thier face. THIS IS ROCK ! Not Metal but ROCK. This is a great DVD , worth collecting not only for the music and workmanship but just for the mere fact that is has become so freaking rare. technically brilliant. Great stage pressence and crystal clear video and audio. 30 Years and it just begun all over again....Rock hard ride free....Free Bird - Phoenix."
3,Great live concert; less great DVD,"Watching a live physical concert is totally different from watching a DVD concert.When you are physically there, most likely you miss on few details like the stage, lighting etc. as you will be totally inspired by the sound and the music.In the DVD, the music is great and would have loved to see it physically. However as a DVD it fails to deliver a complete package.The stage is a mess, the lighting is good to watch it live, but not as good to watch it on a DVD. The sound is acceptable however far from perfect. All in all the Music is fantastic and the guys played very well.I recommend it for the history and to see Powell in action, however the show is mediocre and is not really worth watching more than once.Recommended? difficult to say. leave it up to you."
4,A Bit Disappointed,I love Wishbone... but when it first started playing and I didn't recognize most of the band members except for Andy Powell I was a bit disappointed. Overall though the musicianship was excellent. Looks like I'll have to go back a ways to find the original band.
3,"The old, old Academy","Considering how old this book is, it's interesting to me that so many copies of it (relatively) seem to be available at various antiquarian book shops. It's been some time since I read it, but I recall it as a not-too-bad adventure story, set at an Academy that's quite different from the one that exists today.That much is signaled by the subtitle's description of Academy students as ""cadets"" (the term ""midshipman"" became official in 1902). What seems almost otherworldly to anyone who knows the Yard is that this story even predates the construction of Bancroft Hall. Obviously, there's not too much in here of contemporary application. But for the reader interested in Academy fiction or the portrayal of bygone days at Annapolis, this is a story that has stood the test of time -- at least, stood it well enough not to fade into complete obscurity."
5,sweet queen style vocals rock,sweet always had incredible vocals and they usually went from bubblegum to hard rock to mainstream in one disc!!!Except perhaps 'funny how sweet how coco can be' which is more bubblegummy. This one has no bubblegum it's all metalic rock and it's great stuff with the hit 'action' on here and there isn't a bad song on it.sweet was a incredible band a few bands except queen had guys that could sing like this. This is a great band to collect by any standards and this is a gem in their catalog.
5,Where were you in '76?,"I'll tell you where I was--I was 16 and just discovering my love of hard rock music (I know, late bloomer). It's a shame that Sweet never rose to the top in the U.S. like they did in Europe. I remember dancing in a German disco in '77 with ""Fox On The Run"" blasting from the speakers. As an avid Sweet fan and collector, I have to tell you that this is THE moment in their careers. For all the reasons why, just read the comments of previous reviewers. Kudos to Capitol Records for issuing U.S. releases in the 70's (Desolation Boulevard, Give Us A Wink and Off The Record) which were far superior to the records released in Europe. I rate this the best hard rock album released in 1976. Period."
4,four and one-half stars,"To me ""Give us a Wink"" was the high watermark that the band could ever have hoped to achieve considering they started out as a glam/bubblegum/teeny booper act under the control of pop songsmiths Mike Chapman, and Nikki Chinn. This could be considered the Sweet's dark album with cut after cut being brooding, standoffish, and sleazy. ""keep it in"" and ""White mice"" drive with reckless abandon while ""Yesterday's Rain"" and ""Healer"" are mid-tempo rockers that make full use of the bands skills at creating tension and climax. Lead Singer Brian Connolly's voice is shredded at the end of most cuts and sounds incredible while yeoman guitarist Andy Scott makes the most out of every solo and riff, and there are plenty of good riffs to be found here. Production is not a bright as ""desolation Blvd."" or ""Off the Record"" but it adds the the greasiness of the whole album, which is ripe with sex and violence. One of my faves from 70's rock, I put it alongside ANYTHING made from the era."
2,The heaviest album by Sweet,"This is the most heavy album from glam rocker Sweet. No bubblegum pop at all. But the problem is that Sweet never was a heavy metal band and some of the songs seem rather un-natural. Bits and pieces are good and especially ""Action"" and ""The lies in your eyes"" makes this one worth to have, but this album is nothing in comparison to ""Off the record""."
1,Turned my finger a different color!,"I usually am a big fan of 925 sterling silver, and also a big fan of Eve's Addiction, but this piece of jewelry made my ring finger turn a green/grey color of where the band was on my finger. Terrible. But beautiful design, cheap 925 or certainly not 925 sterling silver!"
2,Nice to see T.F.F. but...,"...this is a pretty chopped up concert video. Thus, it's difficult to watch. The audio and film don't always sync up, intros are late and endings are cut off. It's sad that this film is out there and can't be better presented. I gave it 2 stars just because I was able to nab a T.F.F. concert flick as I never saw them during their ""impressionable years"".what to watch for:1.This is Curt's last tour before departing so there's a lack of chemistry between him and Roland. I recently saw them on their reunion tour and it was a great show.2.Oleta Adams. Oleta Adams. Oleta Adams."
5,Must-have daily journal for expectant mothers and fathers,"Whether you write in a journal daily or barely do any writing at all, this reflection-style book is the most perfect book for every mother and father-to-be. Its day by day, month by month format provides the opportunity for mothers and fathers to share their thoughts, feelings, fears, hopes, and dreams with the child they are expecting, throughout the pregnancy. Questions asked to both mothers and fathers about their emotions, current happenings in the world, future plans as a family, and Mom's progress throughout the pregnancy invite short, evocative reflections. The book is a special gift to mothers and fathers as they communicate with each other about the impending birth of their child, and the completed book will be a treasure for the child to keep and to read."
2,"Good reading, but how do I analyze my data?","In the theoretical sense, this book provides a very thorough overview of categorical data analysis. However, this book should not be used as a reference for the scientist needing to do the occasional number crunching of categorical data. The examples are vague and the tests are not well explained. If you want to derive the tests, this book is for you. If you're not a statistician at heart and just want the answer, I suggest looking at Conover's ""Practical Nonparametric Statistics"" for a good explanation of which tests to use and how to use them."
5,The one to have,"If you want one book on Categorical Data analysis, this is the one. But there are others that are easier to read, if your math is not great (including the same author's book with an almost identical title)"
3,Great book! Misadvertised shipping..,"Agresti's book is what every statistics professor I've had mentions when teaching categorical data analysis, and after having it for a few weeks, I agree that it's great. Very clear chapters with useful exercises. As a second year graduate student, it's perfect for me. However, I would have purchased the book from the school bookstore if not for amazon's promised ""buy it by BLANK time today and, if you choose two-day shipping, get it by BLANK"" . They didn't even ship the book until the date they advertised I would be receiving it. Disappointing. And, I assume, intentionally misleading. Definitely get this book, but maybe not from amazon if you need it soon."
5,EXCELLENT TRANSACTION,Was quite impressed at the speed with which I received the book. The book came as advertized. Will do business with this person again and will recommend others to do so.
3,Annotations reviewed,"I think the Annotations book is good for those comfortable using the Cuisenaire rods. The hands-on Cuisenaire rods are used extensively throughout the book. The Annotations book is basically a teacher's guide for using the Miquon Math workbook series. It does help with clarifying concepts introduced in the Miquon books. The down side to this book is sometimes the workbook sheets that are reproduced and reduced in size in Annotations, are not easy for the student to follow."
5,GREAT gum . . .,"Company made a mistake taking this gum off the shelf as it is delicious, whitens teeth and is sugarless with sucralose rather than aspertame, which anyone who wants to stay healthy will avoid like the Plague. What were they THINKING?"
5,"George Shearing - ""Conception"".","I have loved the Shearing sound since I first heard it and I have a number of LP's of George's groups including an old quite battered 'pirate' LP of the tracks on this CD. As these tracks are from the earlier recording sessions George did I was very excited to be able buy one of the ""classic"" recordings on CD at last.Musically this is a fabulous recording with not only some classic 'standards' but the 'originals' are also real swingers, especially the title track and the other bebop styled tunes.All this comes in an excellent package with large photos in the cover and a very informative and detailed booklet.If you like Shearing as much as I do then this is a MUST buy!!Let's Dance Big Band"
4,"not their best outing, but still really good","I fell in love with CUD on their Leggy Mambo album, and while I have listened to this CD over and over again, I do have to say that in some ways, I was a bit disappointed by this effort. Don't get me wrong -- there are some fantastic songs on here, such as 'Easy' and 'No Smoking,' but it is a less coherent effort. The album just doesn't flow as well as their other albums. I'll take the raw energy of Elvis Belt or the over-produced Showbiz over this album any day."
2,Dissatisfied,I was perturbed when my book arrived. The answers had already been filled in to blanks where the answer is provided on the opposite side of the page (making it extremely unnecessary to write them in. The CD was not included. The price was too high for the amount of markings and lack of CD.
3,The Legend Of Alfred Packer,"Got this for the Alfred Packer movie, because it's the only dvd release available. Image quality was better than expected (Still a bit dark at times) and the audio was a bit echoey. Main problem is that in the middle of the movie whatever VHS master they transfered this from messes up big time and the picture gets warped for a few seconds. haven't watched the other films in the set, but worth getting for the Alfred Packer film, if you liked movies like ""The Donner Party"" and ""Ravenous."""
2,divorce is STILL too difficult even with this book..,"even with the book, i feel like its too much of a maze for us.. we might have to get a lawyer after all."
1,WRONG COLOR,"I AM SO TICKED OFF!!! I placed an order for 2 BLUE & WHITE toy guns because NYC requires toy guns to be a safety color. I am wearing it for my Halloween costume. I ordered it specifically because it is BLUE & WHITE. I am not even ordering any caps for it. They are just for show. What I received was 1 BLUE & WHITE cap gun and 1 GREY/GREEN cap gun. I can't wear the second one because it is illegal. I am not trying to get fined or worse, shot. I am currently talking to an Amazon.com representative who is trying to correct this issue. I will update this review if I get the replacement by Friday and the right color."
3,Nice looking toy gun.,"The gun itself is a nice replica toy gun however, the caps don't give much of a pop. They smoke more than make noise."
3,Not like the good-old-days,"Bought this for my son after much reflection by him. While I am pleased that the gun's color will make it unmistakeably a toy, the caps produce more smell than smoke or sound. I am sure that the safety police (rightfully) had something to do with this. However, many toys that use sound replication methods have far louder sounds that could damage young ears."
4,Not for the beginner,"Good argument for the rights of animals, but sometimes a bit too ""deep."" Regan is a philosopher, afterall. Great book for those familiar with the topic and who want to deepen their arguments, but probably not the best read for someone just getting introduced to the philosophy of the rights of animals."
4,Haunting and Moving,This is one of the eeriest and most moving books I've ever read. The author recounts his experience on a merchant vessel that is becalmed and then wrecked. The voyage is obviously an allegory of life and Bernanos probes some of its darkest corners. The jacket notes describe the tale as a descent into madness and a voyage into hell and both of those descriptions are apt. I particularly enjoyed the friendship of the old cook with the author even as their end approached. This is one of the rare books that left me wishing I could have met the author.
3,Clever mix of hip hop & Jazz- served with bits of cheese,"I don't intend to downgrade this album. I really like parts. The instrumental parts. The musical heart of Us3, Mel Simpson and Geoff Wilkinson, snipped, looped and blended well crafted musical songs out of the golden vault of truly classic Jazz Blue Note Records still owns. The rap gets- well...annoying and too damn cheesey. The music has staying power mainly because of the source material used as musical structure. The rap sounds dated and paper thin lyrically in the year 2000. For a sound that sounds fresher check out Guru's Jazzamatazz. Its what this album wanted to be, but Us3 added too many trends to date the sound."
4,Jazz or Rap? Why not both?,"Some reviewers attack this album for the rap and some for the jazz, but they just don't get it: this album is both, a pleasing selection of classic Blue Note jazz with funky beats underneath and cool, positive, afrocentric raps on top. It's called ""Hand on the Torch"" because it pays tribute to the past as the torch is passed to the future.If you demand a category, this album isn't for you. On the other hand, if you accept that music evolves and recycles, and if you dig both kinds of music, then you will enjoy this CD. Think Digable Planets or De La Soul. This is what rap might have sounded like in 1960 - with backup from Miles Davis and Herbie Hancock and Maceo Parker."
2,rap ruin!,"i purchased this album knowing there was vocals on the album, however, i didn't realize there was excessive rap to it all. i personally enjoy the blue notes jazz, but not the rap rendition. for myself, it was the rap that ruined it all. if you're looking for a loungey jazz disc with new groove contemporary vocalist taps...try De Phazz's Death by Chocolate album."
2,US3-Hand on the Torch,"After their original recording, this one was really quite disappointing. Almost all hip-hop and hardly any jazz."
2,"Weak CD, its a one hit ""no"" wonder",Its a very weak CD and although Ive heard ppl call this a Rap album its a definite jazz album. This group got famous with one song ironically (or maybe not so ironic) thats the only song thats good on here. DOwnload the song Cantaloop and dont buy this.
3,Just OK,"I found it boring. The bar owner was funny, but why did they make the young kid such an imbecile?"
3,good but a missed opportunity,"As a video, I expected much more. The visuals are too repetitive and seem to be just thrown together. There is way too much use of the ""zoom around a single frame"" effect in order to fill time. With that said, it is still a fun experience and some tracks are good, but it could have been awesome if they spent more time on it.As an audio-dvd, the music fares better. I often listen to this DVD through my stereo while just hanging around the apartment or cleaning.This is a great idea, but somewhere it has to have been done better.."
4,A welcomed idea,"I like the idea behind this DVD. Most of the music on this DVD was Drum -n- Bass. I'm not a big fan of such music, but the visuals were very good. I normaly like digital grafix, but this had a lot of movment and will work well as avideo back drop in a club enviornment."
2,HIP HOP? OH MAN!!!!!!!!!!!!!!,"I HATE RAP AND HIP HOP. HATE THIS ALBUM. HERB AND HORRIBLE, OH I MEAN HIP HOP IS NOT GOOD! THE FIRST TRACK IS COOL THOUGH......"
5,Book: Nightmares in the Sky,This book has great photos and Stephen King's text is just the right touch. Nice additioni to my King collection.
5,Crush Groove,Yo-Do you like Chromeo?Buck 'em... Boycrusher is twice as dope.All you have to do is listen to the first song and you'll be hooked.If you don't start shakin' it...it's time to get some better speakers because it sure isn't the music's fault!- BUY IT BUY IT YOU WON'T REGRET IT
5,Another Lost Masterpiece,"""Volume Two"" gets most of the noise while ""One"" is pushed down the ladder of Sonny's massive recorded output. The Rollins/Coltrane standoff on ""Tenor Madness"" is good for a couple of listenings but drifts slighly off point. ""Volume One"" is straight Sonny at one of his best periods before leaving for Europe. This album defines Sonny Rollins for me, but there are many more LP's of his that look toward the same conclusion. This particular record is a great add to the Blue Note Jazz catalogue...there is nothing better than the round sound Rollins gets from his horn"
4,Not Just For Salespeople,The Book of Excellence has age-old and time tested advice for anyone who wants to put his or her best foot forward. Excellent gift for a recent graduate. A great reminder for all. Parris Martin
5,Well worth it,"I have been using this keyboard for several weeks now, and I simply love it. It works extremely well. It's easy to set up, easy to use, feels great, has many shortcut keys integrated, and is lightweight. If I type lightly, I can even use it on my lap, though I would imagine it's not stable enough for most users to do so.My only complaint is the backrest (which holds up the PDA) can slip if not used on a hard surface. I tend to work on the back of my backpack (the flat side) when commuting to work, though this little stand sometimes slips and wants to fall.However, I have no other complaints. It's allowed me to (almost) ditch my laptop for research papers and essays."
5,Great Wireless Keyboard,I love this wireless keyboard for my Dell Axim v50. It was easy to setup and worked without any flaws. Excellent product.
4,Stowaway IR Wireless Keyboard,"Nice little keyboard. Comes with a carrying case. In one of the pictures you see a Treo 650/700 sitting in the palm pilot cradle. I have a Treo 700p and it does not sit in that cradle, it is too thick. I have to use rubber bands to keep it securely in place. The infared wireless wand must be almost directly above the IR beam port of your palm pilot for it to work. 1/2 inch away and it won't work at all. Next time I'm spending a little extra money and getting the bluetooth wireless keyboard and save myself some hassle. Overall good product, not what I expected."
5,perfecto para una palm Tungsten E2,"Excelente producto, lo probe y funciona muy bien con una Palm modelo Tungsten E2 y modelo Zire 31, con el procesador de palabras y la hoja de calculo del programa Documents to go. La instalacion del software es super facil. Con la conexion a internet y algun cliente msn o yahoo se puede chatear perfectamente."
3,Didn't work with Verizon XV6700,I couldn't get the driver to work with my XV6700 running Windows Mobile 5. Hopefully the Bluetooth one will work. The product did look and feel OK.
5,Son of Fiat 126,"I agree with all the above reviews and can't really add much to them. Particularly the point about the track order - for me, two very important moments on this album are when ""Pile-up"" and ""Son of mustang ford"" kick in. I love this band's mixture of aggressive drumming and subtle song structuring. When I listen to Swervedriver, I keep worrying that any minute, they're going to let their standards slip and do something a bit mediocre - it's something to do with the vocals and the fact that they're British, that I can't quite explain - but on this album, the good feeling just keeps flowing."
5,amazing...,"this album is mind-numbingly monumental. there's a reason why the used copies of this album are selling for $39.95 and up.it's that friggin' good. pick up this cd at all cost!!! then put it in your cd player at night, turn out all the lights and crank up the volume...enough said!"
3,Very Small!,"The product smells pretty good ,the bottle is really cute,but very very small,not really worth the price."
3,not really the instruction I had hoped for,This book seemed to be outdated and not the instructional tool I need to draw flowers! I would not recommend this to a beginner!
4,Liked it alot,I really enjoyed this book. The two leads had great chemistry. Clare made me laugh several times with her witty remarks. Tony really seemed to love her and was patient when her insecurities seemed to take over. Some of the action was over the top especially considering she is pregnant but I still enjoyed the story.
2,Predictable........,"In this trilogy, I enjoyed the first book, the second book was so-so, but this third one was much too predictable. Some reviewers say this book can stand alone, but I didn't think so. I recommend reading the trilogy in order.But here's something that bothered me. Several people mentioned in reviews of the first two books of this trilogy that they were reminded of Janet Evanovich's Stephanie Plum series. To be honest, overall, there were so many similarities to Evanovich's Plum books that I was stunned."
5,Excellent work to introduce one to Rabbinical Literature,"The book is compact, yet very informing. It is called an ""introduction"", yet it is perhaps a little bit more than an introduction. At the same time, I would recommend this work for beginner as well as those more familiar with the topic.The book is very readable for the amount of compressed information and scholarship it includes. The many reprints make it up-to-date."
5,A superb reference work,"There are many books that claim to be an ""introduction"" to the Talmud. Most of them make that introduction without much context. Strack's volume will not teach you how to study Talmud and Midrash, but it will give you a good understanding of what they are and how they fit into the larger frame of Jewish tradition and literature.For the intermediate and more advanced reader alike, the book is a well-indexed reference work for Talmud and Midrash study, including quick and simple definitions of terms, identifications of obscure titles, and superior (if occasionally outdated) bibliographies for each chapter. This is a work that should be in the library of every serious student of rabbinics."
4,Good Intro,"This is a good introduction to the Talmud and Midrash. However, perhaps the authors should have published an ""Introduction to the Introduction of the Talmud and Midrash."" There is a lot of scholarly material here, but it is written from the viewpoint that the reader is already somewhat familiar with Rabbinic Literture. One may wish to familiarize himself/herself with such terms as Baraita, Tannaim and Amoraim before beginning this book. A great book for anyone wanting to study Rabbinic Literature."
4,A still timely writing for all pastors,"Although first published 25 years ago, Peterson addresses a matter that is still timely, the need for all pastors to commit themselves to prayer, reading scripture and spiritual direction. These, Peterson asserts, are an essential foundation for all other aspects of ministry. Peterson's premise, that many pastors have abdicated their primary calling to these three practices, is still very relavent to the current state of pastoral ministry. Its content will be useful for new and veteran pastors alike."
3,"Good, But Not Great","This title is the second one I have read by Peterson. I frankly was disappointed with lack of applicable content. He does address pastors directly, but he seems to ramble when he could be making one point after another. Most pastors will find something in his words of value. I did. For the nuggets of truth this book does contain, I give it three stars. Still, Peterson seems to be capable of doing so much better.There is no doubt that Peterson is a man of God who has a message for the people of this age. I just sensed that the ""thus saith the Lord"" was garbled somewhere between the prophet and the written proclamation. For the money, this title is a good, but not great, read for pastors and other church leaders."
5,Appropriately Unsettling,"In his sharp yet graceful way, Peterson calls pastors to a needed level of introspection. As he notes, ""It doesn't take many years in this business to realize that we can conduct a fairly respectable pastoral ministry without giving much more than ceremonial attention to God."" Increasingly, the church is using social tools to both chase our rapidly accelerating society and to guage the church's success within our society. As a relatively new pastor, I've already experienced the pressure (my own and otherwise) to minister and measure my ministry by social standards that often have nothing to do with God's direction. Yet, Peterson clearly reminds the reader that faithfulness to God's call is often counter to society's best and most up-to-date wisdom. Through reading this book, my own priorities have shifted for the better."
4,resonates with me,"Peterson challenges his readers to avoid settling for maintaining merely an image of pastoral work. Using the metaphor of a triangle, he describes the visible lines of pastoral work as preaching, teaching and administration. But the lines of these public activities cannot give any shape to a ministry without the interior angles of prayer, Scripture reading and spiritual direction to hold them together.Peterson declares, ""I don't know of any other profession in which it is quite as easy to fake it as in ours."" I'm in seminary now and I am emphatically not hoping for a ministry of ""faking it."" Working the Angles offers encouragement for the traditional, and traditionally quiet, disciplines of the interior angles. This is a book that I expect will resonate after five, ten and twenty years of pastoral experience."
1,Awful.,Arrived well packaged with a hairline crack on the bottom that was invisible to naked eye - but not to the oil that spilled EVERYWHERE. 1 star for packaging well done.
5,Alice's adventure in wonderland.,The first time I could see that the company has been the most popular and important thing to happen often. I saw that the government of money don't purchase any of their popular things.
5,Now 5=GOOD,Now 5 is a mix of songs from the moffatts to hammy the hampster. I rate it 5 stars because it has so many different types of music like rap and pop and hip-hop. It's fun to dance to too. To all thoes girls that love music mixes Now 5 is for you.
3,"Too many pieces, not enough ""real food""","My kids love the ""real food"" pieces that they can actually pretend to prepare and eat. This set has too many cans and packaged food that just create more mess to clean up without any additional fun."
1,Too many conceptual leaps,Walker often takes leaps in conceptual explanations that leave the students wondering where the heck they lost track of what he was saying. I find Cutnell&Johnson's textbook to be much more concept friendly.
3,Didn't think that much of it,"Of course, that may be because I didn't like the course all that much. I thought that the text was too wordy and did not present concepts well enough. The example problems are good to have and so are the chapter summaries. All in all, I thought the concepts could have been explained much better and with less words."
2,Beware!,"I have no particularly harsh words for Walker's text. It is a simple introduction to physics, which might suffice as secondary reading material for students in AP physics. Since I occasionally tutor AP physics, I thought this would be a good book to lend/share with students trying to use their study time constructively.As for my copy, pages were unmarked so far as I can tell upon cursory inspection. However, the cover was in poor shape, and the seller (CNMehta) apparently thought that mailing a six-pound textbook in a standard manila envelope was standard operating procedure. Perhaps I'm fortunate there was anything left of the envelope so its destination could be ascertained. You'd think that anyone smart enough to sign up for a physics course would know better, but I did mention that the pages were unmarked, eh?In conclusion, four stars for Walker, and none for CNMehta. We live and we learn."
4,It's Physics,"The book gives good examples when it gives examples, and is detailed enough when going over concepts so that you understand it. But when it doesnt give those examples you do have to do a little more searching. Overall its a good a book."
3,coulda woulda shoulda,"the book was just what i needed, but the shipping took too long, that was the only drawback. I waited too long to get a used one. Good buy."
5,Great Deal,My son was so happy when he opened his gift. He liked the way it fit. I loved that I got it at a great price and it came so quickly.
4,Always a hit with my boys,"My boys love to play with soldiers, the more they get the more of a war they can creat, the more it will keep them away from T.V.This toy is durable, and has nice gadgets with it. For my 7 year old, it is always a big hit. I will keep buying the new ones. All in all it is a great toy for my boys."
4,It's been too many years . . .,"Midnight Sun has been getting alot of airplay on my local jazz public radio station, so I decided to pick up the CD. This sure wasn't the Herb Alpert I remembered, and that's a positive comment. This CD has some of the coolest hot sounds I've heard in quite a while. It's a great combination of straight forward jazz playing with just the right amount of added texture from strings to give it a sound I've been looking for but hadn't found to date. Now I will definitely have to check out his latest offering that he and Lorber worked on."
3,Romance Jazz,"This is basically the first real jazz recording that Herb Alpert has done. He surrounds himself with some great musicians, and takes some standards and puts them in a unique arrangement with the help of Eddie Del Barrio. Among the highlights are Lionel Hampton's title tune, and a swinging version of ""A Taste Of Honey"". The most interesting part of this album is Alpert's trumpet playing. He's out there naked, and fares quite well. He conures up images of Chet Baker and an early Miles Davis. The real treat here is ""Friends"", which features Stan Getz in one of his final studio appearances. Getz and Alpert do a wonderful job on this song. Alpert's muted trumpet is a perfect fit for the mood of this album. It's not bebop to be sure, but it is definitely cool.Incidentally, this would be Herb Alpert's final album for his own A&M Records company, which he and partner Jerry Moss sold a couple of years before this recording."
5,"This Herb Alpert Is A Long Way From ""Whipped Cream""","Wow! I first heard the title song of this CD being played on our local smooth jazz FM station here in Chicago. At the time of the play I didn't catch the performer so I actually called the station to have them tell me who it was from their playlists. When they said it was Herb Alpert I couldn't believe it. This is a far cry--and more enjoyable by far--than any of his pop hits from earlier in his career. I'm sure he made a lot more money with those frothy pop recordings, but this one will be the Herb Alpert I choose to remember. I heard only the title song on the radio, but after listening to all the tracks there's not a single one that I can't rate among my favorites. I sure wish Alpert would have issued more CDs like this one. Don't let it get away!"
5,Smooth and Sexy!!!,"This is a lush, gorgeous collection of smooth and beautiful songs. Herb never sounds better, his playing is sensuous and nuanced, and each song is a journey of late night passion. Herb Alpert is probably one of the best jazz musicians of our age, and yet he is indeed underrated. I think he's right up there with the likes of Miles Davis and Herbie Hancock. This CD definitely deserves to be listened to again and again. I've owned it since 1997, and I'm still listening."
2,Belly Dance Teachers Should Respect Rhythm,"The movements here were moderately interesting, but the movement and music does not synch. This drives me crazy. The instructor gets off the beat and stays off it. I have been through the warmup and first exercise, and she got off the music entirely in the warmup, and got off the measure in the exercise. I'm not very inclined to slog through the rest of it. It is always amazing to me when dance instructors can't find the first beat of a measure, and don't seem to think that is a problem. Dancing is essentially playing an instrument -- one's body. Interpreting the music is primary, not just the ability to perform movements. What a disappointment."
2,Didn't move me.,"I think when showing the moves to belly dancing the legs should be exposed, as this is the real secret to many of the moves. I would like to see the kness and feet as the moves are deminstrated. I am a good dancer, but could not figure out how to do the Pop movement. I also found it quite boring when the moves are repeated so much at the same speed, slower working towards faster would have been more benifical. I won't be using this DVD anymore."
4,Fun!,I do a lot of Bellydance workouts and this one is very fun! I like the way the moves are taught in short segments and then repeated a lot. I also like that you can skip the learning part and just do the moves or the dance. I wish she taught every move in the dance as i do not have the patience to figure out the fill in steps -- I am an exerciser not a dancer! Also wish I could play the dance in a loop so I could just do it over and over now that I know the moves. But it is a good workout and (did I say this?) fun.
5,Another Kickin' DVD from Michelle,"What makes a good dancer? Skill, personality, and that little extra something that makes them stand out. Michelle's is her incredible flawless execution. Shimmies so small and perfect you wonder if they are a mirage,pops and locks the same. This is a great DVD that teaches all this, plus an extra extra challenging choreography at the end. If you buy this for nothing else buy it for the choreography!"
5,Great DVD,This DVD is a great Belly-dance technique from an excellent dancer and performer. It is challanging and fun.
3,JACKIE'S OPINION,"If you are looking to learn a cheorography, maybe this dvd is for you. This dvd lacks technique. it targets intermediate and advanced dancers, I found it to be average and unnecessary repetitious. If you are looking to learn new technniques, don't bother. If you just want a guided workout then you should give it a try.jackie"
5,great dvd!!,"i've done a few belly dance dvds before jillina's, neena & veena, a tribal fusion one. this one is the best workout so far, as well as teaching some new moves."
4,pleasant discovery,"The music is pleasant and definitely entertaining, not as sparkling as we might expect from Herold, but it must be said that we remember Herold mostly for single pieces who retain the freshness after long time, but brief pieces nevertheless. This is a full time effort and has some lapses but all in all it is well worth buying if you like french ballet music. Give it to ballet supremo Bonynge and you can't fail."
1,"Two deliveries, two defective toaster. Horrible","Rec. first product but when my wife plugged in and confirmed if it worked or not, found that the right side (when facing unit) did not snap and stay down. I sent it back for a replacement to see trend. Hopefully the second unit works well? Will review then.Update: Now 2nd unit does not work properly. Left side is permanently in ""bagel"" mode and only toasts one side.This is a horrible toaster."
1,don't buy it,"I purched this product dec. 3,08 received it and never worked properly. Would not toast bread even on highest setting and still pop up as if it did."
1,nazdaq level II quotes,My opinion: Very poor quality video recording. Content: very poor.recommendation: -10
4,Diagree,"I have viewed over 100 trading related VHS tapes in the past year. This tape provides a good basic introduction to Level II. A highly experienced, profitable, 2+ years experienced day trader may not find much new. For most others, this video worthwhile. Filming is better than 4 out of 5 most such tapes created at seminars by affiliate(s) of Traders' Library."
2,"Like most of OTA's stuff, this is junk","Almost as bad as the poorly-written 'level 2' manual they put out last year. This is a oversimplified video with nothing that will help you unless you don't already know what the inside bid and ask mean.The video production quality is poor, and it's just a basic video that doesn't tell you anything you can't find for free on the net, eg at phactor.com, for using level2. OTA just wants to take people's money for showing simplistic beginner information - don't waste your time or money."
5,Great For Absolute Beginners,"This is THE book to recommend to beginning music students who are completely and totally musically illiterate (as I was). The only knowledge that is assumed of the reader is the ability to count and the knowledge of the first seven letters of the alphabet. From that starting point he guides the reader step by step through key signatures, scales, intervals and chords. This is one of the most helpful books I have come across. I only wish he'd write a follow up volume taking it to the next level."
3,Only for the absolute beginner,"Only purchase this book if you know absolutely nothing about the most elementary concepts of music theory and don't mind reading something that sounds like it was written by your overenthusiastic 9 year old brother (bad jokes, capslock, EXCLAMATION POINTS!!!!!!!!!!!!!!). More ambitious students should probably skip this book and go straight for a more complete introduction.Content:- Key signatures- Major, natural/melodic/harmonic minor, and blues scales- Triads/sevenths... that's it. Don't let the page count trick you; the pages are small and the fonts are gigantic."
4,Useful; requires patience.,"I bought this to practice my media Arabic. I've studied Arabic for years and most recently as a Peace Corps Volunteer in Morocco. While my Moroccan dialect is pretty good, my MSA has floundered a bit over the years. This book is useful for study as it offers translations of the articles in the back of the book. If there were to be more editions I'd like to have recordings of someone reading the articles. I also think that ambiguous verbs, verbs with multiple common meanings and rarely used verbs should be explained a little more fully. I also wish that commonly used phrases and idioms were included in the text boxes under the articles that contain some vocabulary found in each article. In my opinion, these text boxes could be more helpful. I wish the translations were little more literal. Overall, though very useful as a self study aid and would be extremely useful in the classroom if used by a native speaker to teach."
2,Salty Breads,"Let me preface this review by saying that I am a fan of Jamie Oliver, but a disappointed one when it comes to this book. Normally, I wouldn't take away so many stars from a book based on just a single recipe, but since this recipe is the basic bread recipe that serves as the master recipe for all the breads in the book, I feel this is justified. My edition of the book lists 2 tablespoons of salt for the basic bread recipe per 2lbs of bread flower. The type of salt is not specified and those of us who bake know that there is a considerable difference between 2 tablespoons of table salt vs sea salt. Just looking at the recipe this amount of salt seems excessive. I followed my gut and made the bread with 2 teaspoons of table salt; the bread came out quite nice. However, I can only assume that had I made it with 2 tablespoons of table salt, it would have come out inedible, along with every other bread recipe in the book."
2,Don't judge a book by its title,"This cookbook is just The Return of the Naked Chef with a new title. I already owned The Return of the Naked Chef, so now I have two. I really dislike publishers who mislead us by changing titles or changing covers just to get us to buy that which we already own."
4,Nice sunglasses; Not lovin' the color,"This is my first pair of Zeal sunglasses, and sadly, I had to return them. These glasses have a slightly smaller look would look great whether in a business suit or running a marathon - very functional but still a little sporty. I have a medium size face and the fit is perfect and they stay where put, unlike many sunglasses I purchase. The polarization is an outstanding feature and if you have never had glasses with this, you are missing crisp, clear sight, which is much easier on the eyes, especially in bright sunlight. Why am I returning them? I ordered the Venetian Violet and the color is not as shown online (not just at Amazon, but on other websites as well). The true color is much lighter, more like a light mauve. I like the glasses so much I almost kept them, but just don't care for the color. Amazon's return policy is the best and the return shipping was free."
2,product not good.,"Picture is bad so is the sound,it is recorded by a single camera that moves up and down which may damage your eyes. Its not worth selling it."
5,Tora Tora Just Plain Rocks,"I got Tora Tora's first CD, Surprise Attack when I saw the video, ""Walkin' Shoes"" after I saw the video on MTV. I was blown away by the blues sound they had. I thought finally a rock band that says they play blues rather than just call it rock. I thought the band had disappeared. Then I found out that they actually made another CD, Wild America! I looked for it everywhere and finally found it. It was just as innovative as the first album and had some better songs. I especially like Amnesia, City of Kings, Cold Fever and Wild America. Wild America is one of the greatest patriotic songs of all time. City of Kings is a nice pounding song. The guitars in Cold Fever are great. Amnesia reminds me of their first album as most of it was bitching about women. If the lead singer didn't have such bad luck with women we may not have had this great album.:) Buy this and you won't be disappointed."
3,If you buy it for just one song...,"Amnesia is a killer track on this CD. While the rest of the CD does not quite capture the same intensity as this one, Amnesia is a classic ""I'm single again and the hell with my ex"" track!"
5,Solid follow-up to debut album; rising band,"Very strong follow-up to ""Surprise Attack"". This is an unbelievable rock band with a hint of blues. If you like hard rock and blues, this is the band for you."
4,Pablo y Nela: Un libro largo,"This book, about Pablo, the blind man who falls in love with his guide, Nela, embodies the frailty of appearance vs. reality. After reading this book, I am able to look at Nela and see an image of the modern woman. Despite the fact that it's over 100 yrs old, Marianela lives on today."
5,Guidance from Camelot,"One of my earliest Tarot teachers always emphasized that it's not enough to just memorize the ""definitions"" of each card ~ it's important to explore what you SEE in each card each time. This deck is fabulous for that kind of intuitive reading style.While the accompanying book is wonderful and thorough in the Tarot definitions and Arthurian legend background that are provided, the cards themselves open up into cinematic scenes that offer insight and guidance that shift with each throw. The deck shimmers with life and with wisdom. It became my favorite the first time I used it."
5,Best Tarot Deck and book ever!,This deck and book literally make every reading i do more accurate and feel right. It is easier for me to identify with the Arthurian symbolism than the traditional decks. I LOVE this deck.
3,Wrong Track List,"This is a middle-of-the-road Joan Armatrading album IMHO. At any rate, the track listing is incorrect for this album. It should read like this:1) True Love2) Crazy3) Wrapped Around Her4) Sometimes I Don't Wanna Go Home5) Square the Circle6) Weak Woman7) Can I Get Next To You8) Can't Get Over (How I Broke Your Heart)9) If Women Ruled The World10) Cradled In Your Love"
4,Gonna buy five copies for my mother!,"This is a compilation album of songs (and poems) written by Shel Silverstein. Shel is probably best known for his books of poetry for children, but he also had a bawdy side, writing songs about sex, drugs and rock & roll. This CD features some of his material performed by himself, but it also includes performances of his songs by other people. Shel never had any hits himself, but he did write hit songs for people like Dr. Hook, Bobby Bare and Johnny Cash, many of which are included here. This CD provides a good overview of Shel's songs, both comical and serious. There is an unlisted bonus track, which is Shel performing a ""26 Second Song""."
4,Shell Silverstone,"I was shocked that I could find such an old time favorite, Amazon was great. It worked out great, delivery was in about 3 days."
1,poor materials,"although the main idea of this product is good, the quality of the materials is inferior. the plastic is flimsy and does not hold its' shape when attached to a wall, and the top does not have any kind of way to snap on to the bottom so when it is in use, the pressure from the vent keeps popping the top off. if possibly i am missing something as far as my installation or use of this product please let me know because at this point i feel i have wasted my money.I have been offered to return the product but i infortunately have thrown away the original packaging and shipping papers."
4,Eclectic mix,"Overall, a good collection of songs that don't typically make it to current disco compilations. However, customers should know that the tracks (sound as if they) were taken from an LP. Jellybean Benitez is credited as mixing the songs, so it would makes sense that he used LP's instead of digital sources (as most DJ's do), but some songs have not aged well on vinyl! (For example, the version of Kelly Marie's ""Feels Like I'm In Love"" is the original US Remix with the added horn instrumentation. There is some distortion with her vocals and the omnipresent string section because it's taken from an old record.)But, this is not a ""sit down and analyze"" CD - it's for dancing! Enjoy, you'll have fun with this collection!"
4,One Track Treasure,"Teri DeSario's ""Nothing's Gonna Keep Me From You"" is worth this entire CD. This is an extended version (6+ minutes) and while the track is a classic, the mastering on this particular compilation is disappointing. Not only is there (minimal) static throughout the recording, but the levels have been engineered too high. It's as if the track was dubbed from an LP. Otherwise a great find, as DeSario's voice is pure and angelic. This is a great Barry Gibb song (non-Bee Gees)."
5,obusforme and matching pillow,"I cannot say enough about the obusforme backrest and pillow. I have had major back surgery twice in the past twenty-five years, That is how long I have been using this product. This is my third one because the covers are washable and over the years have become worn. I highly recommend this product. It is easy to take to the movies and any other place I will be sitting for a long time. It is good for anyone who sits a lot at work etc and just needs that extra lumbar support. I also like the seat cushion which may be attached with the velcro to the backrest."
3,Too far forward.,"Take into account how far forward this device will place you in your seat. This support will push you forward toward the steering wheel, too close for my comfort in the car I would've been using it in."
2,"Too narrow, too hard, too bad","I got this to help transform a set of uncomfortable truck seats into something I could use on long trips. Unfortunately it doesn't do it for me. I think that together with the seat pad this costs about $120 or more. Upon inspection I'd be surprised if anyone paid half that if they bought it in a store after checking it out.In my case it was too narrow, the frame edges are felt and padding is pretty minimal. It must work for those with strange back ailments, but for me it didn't. It also lacked a good system for attaching it to a seatback, so you'd have to reposition it every time you use it.A tiny person might get some use out of it but I can't imagine what's in it that costs so much to produce. It's a frame, foam and a cheap thin cover that looks like it'd wear through with time.Thankfully Amazon accepts returns on these items. It seems to work for many, but it felt like I was sitting with an ironing board behind me. Literally."
2,Back Rest,Back rest does not stay on seat when you lean back against it. Slides off back of seat and you have to keep readjusting it.
4,Very helpful,"Turns my driver's seat into a place I can actually sit! It was previously more of a torture device. The lumbar support takes a bit of getting used to, but once my spine relaxed around it, I came to love it."
5,It's so comfortable,"This does the trick, it's well worth the money and it does what its supposed to do. Reaaly enjoy the suppoert it gives."
3,So so,Its better than nothing but I don't feel its as good as other reviews. It moves around in the bucket seat in my car when I get in and out. Also its pretty bulky. But it is better than nothing but not worth the price. Also everything sticks to the fabric covering.
5,Terrific back support,"This cushion solved my MIL back trouble within minutes, after months of agony. She now has one in the car, upstairs and downstairs. We have one in both car seats in both cars and now other family members are starting to order multiples for themselves. Sturdy, my oldest one is still like new with all the support I could need. None of us use the little pillow that comes with it though."
5,Best spray gun for the price,"This spray gun has everything that a amateur would need. It works great I sprayed 14 pre-primed doors in about 4 hours, they took one coat, and it was a mirror finish. You can not ask for anything more from a spray gun in this price range. Be prepared to have a lot of overspray as is to be expected with any spray gun."
5,General Purpose spray gun,I did a lot of research prior to purchasing this spray gun.(has both pressure and siphon features with an easy switch knob).I previously had a Binks model 35 that was just super but now discontinued.I replaced it with a Binks Model 25 that lasted one spray session. I recently sprayed acrylic enamel with this gun and it worked flawlessly.This gun hopefully will spray latex and most liquids. The nice thing about Campbell Hausfield is that on their web page you can purchase individual parts or parts kits. I purchased a O ring gasket kit for $15.00.After using and while cleaning this gun I discovered a broken seal. I called CH and they sent a replacement part immediately. So I give a A for both Amazon and CH.
4,experienced user,"I am a self employed painter who does a lot of spraying(furniture,cabinet doors,louvered doors).This is the best versitile,durable,relatively trouble free gun I have found.It is also cheaper at amazon than it was at Home Depotwhich no longer carrys it."
3,Go backward from here...,"Well I didn't think this album was very good. I think the first couple of songs are ok but the rest have a certain pretension and the sound wasn't that good. Around this stage they were starting to add synths and got away from the raw stuff, but maybe Brian Connolly was making it tough for them - alcoholism, the same thing that eventually killed him (liver failure). Cut Above (no Connolly) is maybe a little better than this one. After that is die-hard material."
5,Clever stories of the upper class on the French Riviera,"General Besserly is a retired American officer, formerly of the Secret Service, but now elegantly living on the French Riveria. He serves as a singular problem solver and savior of last resort for an assortment of young and old who have strayed from the straight and narrow. Solving the problems of inveterate gamblers, capturing notorious criminals, or working to fulfill the wishes of a dying Baroness, he works his magic, most often for beautiful young women.The stories are short and intriguing. In particular the Butterfly in the Death Chamber is moving and elegant. Oppenheim paints a wonderful picture of life amid the upper class and royalty in France between the wars."
1,What a disappointment,"David and David is awesome, Bedtime stories is good but Triage is a total disappointment. Baerwald steps away from his flowing style and heavy lyrics to a chopped up sound with lyrics from the Dark side of life."
1,overrated...,"Though the album might appeal to people still living in their parents basement, the album seems like the drunken ramblings of the guy who staggers into the local fast food joint screaming about the evils of the political system.If you want politics mixed with your music, I can recommend the back catalogues of Bruce Cockburn or Jackson Browne (they both have similar left-leaning views that are actually tempered with humanity) but this isn't worth the entry fee. The fact that Baerwald considers Sean Penn a `good friend` should tell any right thinking person *all* that they need to know about paying attention to DB's political pronouncements.Stick to writing the schmaltzy movie ditties, Dave."
3,Good for the price,My 18 yrd old is an inspiring artist so she goes through brushes like a teenager goes through shoes. I figure she will eventually find a certain type that she will stick with...eventually.
5,Nice brushes,I was pleasantly surprised at the quality of these brushes especially for what I paid for them. Would order again or as gift.
5,Well done.,"These items were as advertised, bold and clean. They are a full service use that requires an unusual break in decency."
4,A guilty pleasure indeed,"You know a film's bad when the usually unnoticeable incidentals--lighting, hair, makeup, etc.-- are jarringly bad. Half the actors generally have trouble keeping a straight face for two hours. The script seems to have been scraped from the bottom of a garbage can of oozingly rotten cliches. The action was apparently blocked out by stoned Keebler elves. So it's hard to say why I've seen this movie, oh, some ten times by now...except that it's a delirously slutty trash wallow. It's hard to resist a film that most reviewers hated so much."
1,This body's a stiff,"The spectacularly mediocre Madonna once again wastes valuable celluloid trying to convince the moviegoing public that she can act. (For all I know, she might be sexy, but you have to be able to act to exude it on screen.) I pity the incalculably more talented Julianne Moore for having this piece of dung staining her resume."
1,This should've been the end,This should've been the end of Madonna's movie career and the fact that it wasn't proves that the folks in Hollywood are no smarter than the rest of us. Body of Evidence is one of the most unintenionally funny wastes of film I've ever seen. The sex scenes are not sexy. Madonna spends a lot of time semi naked but her body is not particularly attractive. William DaFoe looked like he was ashamed throughout the movie and the script stinks too. That's about all I can say.
1,Dumb movie!,"Let's face it! Madonna cannot act! Music is her thing. Not acting. It was a disgrace to see Madonna make such a fool of herself in this movie and others. Saying that Madonna can act is like saying that Britney spears can truly sing. When it comes to acting I do give her some credit in Dick Tracy and Desperately Seeking Susan. Save your money and buy one of her cds instead,"
5,Best movie of its kind!,"This has to be the best thriller ever made. I just love Madonna. She may be far from the naughty stage of her career, but that doesn't mean her fans can't look back and enjoy this piece of work. I recommend that you listen to the Erotica album, thumb through the Sex book, then watch this movie---Madonna could put Viagra out of business. Only prudes and those foolish (but well-meaning) Republicans could possibly dislike Madonna. A+"
5,Great Movie!,"I just don't understand why critics & those people who dislike her,always criticize on whatever movies she's done. Anyway, she's got her own style & talent in her career and that's why she's one of the GREAT LADIES OF THE CENTURY....MADONNA UR THE BEST!"
3,Not as bad as Madonna-haters would have you think,"Although, not the most brilliant movie ever made it iscertainly not the worst. Madonna was herald as the reason this moviewas so horrible, but if you notice her performance in no better or worse than any of the other actors. And,as always she bares the entire burden of our (the public's) hang-ups. You know what though? All that aside, it's a fairly decent movie. I mean, it does, at least have a plot, and there is suspense and sex (general movie fare). If you're a fan of the now ethereal girl, this is a gem and milestone from her past."
3,Worth it for a couple of scenes,"The story and acting are appalling, but this is worthwhile simply to appreciate Madonna's body. The scene where she is handcuffed and gets it in the exit hole is exceptional. Otherwise this movie is a turkey."
2,Nothing new or interesting here,"There is some nice production design and the actors do what they can with the script, but there just isn't anything original here, nor is it very interesting.An attorney takes on a difficult client, falls for her and has an affair with her for no discernible reason, the sex scenes are silly and laughable, blah blah.Move on to something else."
4,Body of Evidence,Joe Mantegna was great as always. To much sex for my taste.But I knew the rating. Great plot for movie.Good ending.
2,How many naked women make a Hollywood thriller?,"Basic Instinct had 2. This one has 3, jolly good. Get yourself a paper towel(s) and some hand cream.Body of Evidence only feeds the voyeur in you, not that i am complaining. However, it comes across as a very poor imitation of the sexy thriller genre. Madonna as always is tasty and juicy but acting is not something that she excels in. Her zest is evident in the steamy scenes but she stands exposed in places that require serious emoting.The one dimensional portrayal of all the characters is something common to the genre and is to be taken with a pinch of salt. After the first 15 minutes or so you are pretty well sure of where you're headed with this one, although i must say muff munching and canal digging (hands in the zipper)was most surprising and innovative.However, for me it was Julianne Moore who sizzled in bed rather than Madonna. So hold on to the towel and hand spray, we're going for a ride."
1,"the last film, madonna was shoot with her pistol","Madonna, has a suspact of the murder of her lover, and a man who became her lawyer have an affair with madonna and the end of film we know that madonna secretary's(lesbian's friend) is a murder of her lover and finally madonna death with her pistol"
1,ummm...Madonna cannot act.....,shes the worse actress Ive ever seen. but this movie is so bad that its entertaining. my question to her is.. why would she do a guy like williem dafoe? he's not good looking at all!!
2,"Oh, please!","Whose bright idea was it to hire Willem Dafoe to star in an erotic thriller? They should never work again. Anyway, the movie is not sexy. The sex scenes are ridiculous. The script is overwrought and the dialogue is laughable. If the movie were campy, it'd be worthwhile, but it doesn't have the conviction to be campy. It's just plain bad. Critics blame Madonna for the failure of this movie, but her performance isn't that bad. It's just not that good either. No one comes out of this movie with his/her reputatios intact. What possessed Anne Archer to take this role? Oh well. IF you want an erotic thriller with sexy simulated sex, try Cinemax after hours."
2,Not worth releasing on DVD,"When I saw it in the theatre several years back on opening night, the audience laughed because it was so bad. When I saw it later on cable, it seemed some-what better. ...Overall, it's bland and you've ""seen it before"". Madonna plays the role of a slut. ..."
1,"Madonna's acting abilty and body recall a very short, square piece of cement","Sexless and depressing. Madonna's attempts to beat Sharon Stone as big screen sex early 90's goddess are about as lethal as last week's lettuce. madonna does not seem to get that sex symbols are built like hourglasses not boys on steroids. You also have to not be self consciousness to be sexual on screen which is all she radiates. madonna, not surprisingly, makes a terrible porn star! Rent Kim Kardashian, Nadine Jansen or Danni Ashe unless you are into watching men on steroids with bleached hair fake orgasms and play with melted candles."
5,Poor film,"This is a trashy B-movie wannabe porno flick. Sure, 35-year old well-toned Madonna is nude performing sexual intercourse and practicing bondage & sadomasochism with first-class costar Willam Dafoe. Maybe it's exciting for some, but she should keep her clothes on and just suggest sex. The acting sucks <especially hers> and the director should be shot. She had nothing to gain in this type of role <her ""Sex"" book and ""Erotica"" album already assured her status>. Movie strike #5""Ms. Carlson, would you describe yourself as a dominatrix?..."""
2,Only for Hardcore Madonna Fans...,"Madonna plays woman who has been cultivating an affair with a wealthy man, with a heart condition, who has changed his will so that she inherits eight million when he dies. The find him dead in bed. The wealthy man's secretary and ex-lover are in the mix, as are Madonna's prior affairs.If you want to see Madonna naked, watch this movie; otherwise skip it. It's supposed to be a, ""Who-done-it?"" but in that regard it's so-so. I will say this, Willem Dafoe is a good screen presence as Madonna's lawyer. He looks elegant in a suit. In almost every other role I've seen him in he's dressed bummy. When I saw his interview on Bravo channel, he said that, with his face he'll never get cast as a romantic lead, but dressed up he looks pretty classy and ought to give it a try."
1,Deserves NO stars!,"What a waste of talent - Willem Defoe's. He is a fine actor who thrilled audiences in evocative movies like ""The Last Temptation Of Christ"" and ""Mississippi Burning,"" so what was he doing in this thing? (It's an insult to movies to label it as such). As for Madonna, the queen of self promotion, all it was was a chance to prove that she is one of the WORST actresses of all time and show off her body, which we have already seen enough of even without viewing this cheap, trashy, thing. Don't waste your time. I wish I hadn't."
4,The movie was great,"A lot of people hate this movie, and I don't see why. I really thought it was a pretty good movie. There were no oscar deserving performances but it was good."
3,Definitely not a movie for the kiddies!,"Although I only give this movie 3 stars, I actually thought this was a fairly decent movie. The sex scenes are as steamy or even more so than Basic Instinct (kudos to Madonna!). The plot of the movie however is actually pretty weak. Although there is some unexpected twists, most of the storyline is pretty well played. Much of the acting ranges from wishy-washy to way over the top. All in all the movie is pretty middle of the road."
1,Just pack some earth against a typical house...,"I was very disapointed with this book. First, it was only plans with no supplemental info. Second, most of the designs looked like something you'd see in any other house plan book, but with some dirt pushed around the sides and a thin layer raked across the top. That's it! They're mostly rectangular, which is boring. Even if you built one into a hill instead of just doing the dirt comb-over, they'd still be boring. And small. The few seemingly innovative designs were way too small to even consider. Imagine a bedroom that is 8x11 in cross-measurements, except that it's actually a pie shape taken out of a very small hexagonal structure!The ""underground"" house/structure books tend to be way more cool than ""earth-sheltered"" or ""earth-bermed"" house books. Keep looking. I may make a list of my favorite underground books......"
3,Basic designs......no frills.,"This book did give me some new ideas but not many. I was disappointed that were no hillside designs, most of the designs were for flat landscapes. There seems to be no rhyme or reason to the scale of the drawings, it would be nice if there was some consistency that you could easily cut and tape your own design using two or more drawings. At the very least each drawing should have a scale included. One or two sentences about the pro's and con's of each design would also be helpful. Good place to start.....no frills."
2,US Submarines 1941 - 1945,"Book is very basic....Price is way to much for the contents of the book. Would not have spent the money for it, if I had known there was very little to the book and the information."
4,Cloudy Jewel,Diana H. MYERS. I enjoyed yet another book in this series. Grace Livingston Hill has become one of my favorite authors.
1,Cloudy Jewel,It is the first book I attempted to read by this author and I found it boring. Too much detail and no substance. I found myselft skipping over pages just to try and reach the point. I could not finish it.
1,I found this book to be boring.,"The reading was slow and the plot boring.It was a real chore to finish it and the ending was a disappointment.However, I did enjoy the scriptures and the writing was clean."
4,Grace Livingstone Book,"Have not had a chance to read the book yet. But I am excited that I can get free ebooks from Amazon. Now I am just waiting for the opp, to read it."
1,Poor,I was disappointed in this book. I found it slow moving and did not look forward to going to read it.
3,Cloudy Jewel By Grace Livingston Hill,"Julia is treated cruelly by her sister all of her life and has to do all the cleaning and sewing for her and her spoiled niece.She never is allowed to do anything for herself or get nice clothes or anything pretty. Its wonderful to see her other niece and nephew come to her rescue and make her life wonderful, and treat her as a queen. Really enjoyable story with Christian themes, no swearing or graphic scenes in the book. 1900's era is quite interesting and refreshing. I wish it were on kindle, its such a wonderful story that I read it over again."
4,Cloudy Jewel,I enjoyed this book. Keeps your interest and enjoyable characters. I have read many books by the author and have not been disappointed. I will continue reading her books.
4,My first GLH book to read,"I had no previous exposure to GLH books and it took me a while to get into it. At the end, I had that good feeling that alls well that ends well. I appreciated the wholesome theme throughout, and enjoyed the time-period setting. My only drawback was that the story was a bit sappy and fanciful. Overall, a good read."
3,3515 or 3518?,3515 or 3518? There are two Advanced Solos Packages which include Harriet Wingreen as accompanist. There is no way of knowing which one is which unless the serial numbers or selections are included in the description.
4,I'm So Fonda Jane,"Jane Fonda being one of the most visible and vocal celebrities of our time gives us a play-by-play of her life in words in vivid, sometimes shocking detail. And sometimes too vivid. She isn't afraid to reveal her desires and secrets and speaks about herself in perfect time with her up-tempo personality. We expect her to be open and full-spectrum and she covers all the bases. ""My Life So Far"" is weighed down heavily in the political side of her life and made the rest of her existence seem secondary. On a side note, Jane's incessant, in-your-face need to showcase her fluent French by PRO-NUN-SEE-ATE-ING EV-E-RY FRENCH SEN-TENCE was so irritating, I just skipped the chapter and had to play it back in doses. But it was perfect. And Jane leaves you feeling like there is another fifty years to her life, the best being yet to come."
2,My llife so far,I found this book contained too much about her political life to keep me interested. I much preferred reading the parts about her acting career and personal life. For those people interested in American politics they would find it interesting I would expect.
4,My Life so Far by jane Fonda,"As a woman reader I found the book ""an interesting read"" If I were Jane I would have HELD ON TO TED."
1,Way too much...,"I am so glad I got this book from the library and didn't spend good money for it. Having heard that Jane Fonda has become a Christian I decided to read this book (otherwise I wouldn't have). I wanted to see how Christ had influenced her thinking on her life. Quite frankly, her Christian walk wouldn't have filled a complete page. All politics & faith aside, I had to force myself on general principle to finish the book. 200 pages shorter MIGHT have made it a better read. Way too much information - do we really need to know about the 3-somes? I applaude her discussion about the bulimia. Honestly? I found it a boring book and a waste of my time to read."
1,"Wow, everyone is a 'writer'","Just another example of a self-indulged, ego-maniac, who does not take personal responsiblity for her actions and stands to point the finger at everyone else for her 'misfortunes'. Boo-hoo, what a spoiled-princess...why don't you serve and then judge who is and isn't a coward?"
2,not genuine,"I was a Jane Fonda fan. Being a woman that was around in the 80's who wasn't. That said, I recently met her in a casual setting and she was beyond cold and actually rather nasty. I have met many celebrities in my life and she was by far the most rude. I feel strongly that this woman is all smoke and mirrors after that encounter. It ruined her book for me because I don't buy anything she says."
2,curiousity killed the cat,My curiousity was peaked by the TV interviews. This book really goes into a lot more details about Ms. Fonda's life than I had ever hoped to know!
2,My Life So Far ?,"I really wanted to read and enjoy this book. yes, I read My LifeSo Far but that's the most I can say about the book."
4,Must read !,"My Life So Far by Jane Fonda is a fascinating look into her family life and journey into womanhood. Very revealing look into her life as the child of Henry Fonda to ""Hanoi Jane"" and the criminal investigation waged against her by the government, to Jane the mother/wife, to the insightful woman she is today. She is her own woman. Never knowing much about her, I found this book intriguing, candid and educational."
3,Hollywood's loss is Atlanta's gain,"This memoir may not rank among the world's most enriching literature, but it is immensely readable, open and even brave. Jane Fonda is a woman of copious beauty, stamina and generosity, and Atlanta is lucky to be her chosen home."
5,Wonderful read,"After reading this book, I'm so impressed with Jane Fonda's intelligence and courage. She has written a very honest book. It's not a tell-all, it's more intimate than that. She said she has been striving for intimacy in her life and I think it shows in her writing."
2,Fonda not Fonda,"This book seems to suffer from the same self deception as do books by the junior Senator from New York, as they both seem more intent on revitalizing their career than in telling the truth. Surely, she has been on every talk show on earth, offering her late father forgiveness in absentia for his taciturn nature and seemingly blaming the ""Midwest"" for making him that way. You almost expect her to commence bombing on Omaha instead of Hanoi. You would think it would have dawned on her at 67 that her struggle against her father has made her what she is or at least what she was for most of her life. At this stage, she still seems to be searching for the public to embrace her, much as Hillary, but with that grating voice and self absorbed manner, even less likely it will happen with her. She does seem to love all of her children, adopted or not, or hers or not, so that in a Mia Farrow way, she seems happy now."
1,Yawn- banal; and who cares?,"If you just love following celebrity lives, go buy this book and read no further.For the rest of you: Come on, do you really CARE about Jane Fonda's life so far? She's JUST an actress. God grant her many years, but is it really worth your time and the cost of a hardcover to read about her ""tinge of regret"" at three failed marriages, a fading career, and youthful stupidities like the Hanoi incident?Jane, we're all delighted you have gotten presumably wiser as you got older, and that you have discovered Christ, and that you are looking forward to the future- but guess what, that's true of millions of folks your age! The fact the you are a celluloid celebrity hasn't given you any insights except maybe how to be rude to people at the Albuquerque airport when you sneak down from your new age hacienda in Santa Fe.No, we're not paying a fortune for a book written to pep up your career and help flog your new film ""Monster-in-Law."""
1,Oh Please!,"I could hardly wait to get this book. Once I received it and started reading it, I couldn't wait to get done with it. I got the impression she wrote it so she could let everyone know what an awesome person she is and how insecure she is and how she doesn't think she's pretty. Wah....Wah....Wah....At times she comes across as an echo of all the hours spent with her therapist. Poor Miss Fonda, her daddy never acknowledged her enough. Oh please. What a waste of time I spent on this book."
2,"""My Life So Far""","This was an interesting book, but a slow read. Seemed like there was a lot of repetition that really was not necessary in my view. It did not contain any information that wasn't already common knowledge about Jane Fonda or the Fonda family."
1,Better Red With Green Dollars,"Fonda proves that there can be rich white trash, too.Some people may not appreciate the irony that this highly privileged product of capitalism, who acquired more capitalist millions of her own, so eagerly promoted Communism.This is just the sort of rationalization we could expect from someone who betrayed her country to help the enemy torture American prisoners of war.If you must read this tripe, do as I did and go to a public library. Or wait until the Marxists take over and make it a college text book."
4,"Jane Fonda Honesty that I Understand and Respect, 10 stars","This book reflects Jane Fonda's admirable honesty. She has had (and I believe still has) a mesmerizing life. She made some errors, recognized them, and always been willing to grow and modify with the times and because of her own experiences.I discovered something that I did not know when I bought the book-to love and admire this woman more.I read it in one night, and I could not put it down! The most important thing about this book is that you will read a portion and then put it down and start looking at yourself.If you have any interest in overcoming problems, (as I did, and anyone should) this is important read. It is about beautiful Jane, and so much more...stars"
2,Too much kvetching,"I read this book and was disappointed. It is one of those ""poor misunderstood me"" tomes. It is hundreds of pages of kvetching (complaining) and just proves that the famous as well as the infamous can be published no matter how well or how badly they write. The most interesting part of the book is Jane's life with Ted Turner. Sorry Jane,I still think you are a wonderful actress. Stick to that."
3,Jane: acts one through three,"Jane is a pretty misunderstood woman. People make judgements about her based on stories they see in the media, and based on the rhetoric of those who oppose her. I learned a lot about the real Jane Fonda in this book. Her childhood was not that pretty. Her relationship with her father was strained at best, and this book delves into that with the insight and sensitivity of a person who has learned to accept parents who are not perfect, and who has come to understand how those early years shaped her life and the decisions she made throughout.- C.A.Wulff, author of Born Without a Tail"
5,Well I just thought this was something ...,"I can't say as I ever found Jane Fonda to be a good or successful actress ... is it acting if you play yourself? But I can say that I enjoyed this book. Through her courage and strength and honesty, we understand why she turned her back on her country and used the horrors of war for a photo-op to fulfill her ego-driven attention-intoxicated personality. We understand now, Jane and we forgive you. I mean that's really no big deal in the grand scope of things. My thing is why would she accept a role with such a poor script in Monster-in-Law? There's not a single page as to that betrayal of the world's people. I just hope she has the courage and strength ... and honesty to be able to write more self-serving books that only delusional fans will buy or find any worth in."
3,Overanalyzed,"I found this book interesting....and Jane definitely holds nothing back. However, throughout the book I kept thinking to myself that one of her main issues in life is not all the insecurites etc that she has.....but that she analayzes every second of every day and emotion. Sometimes things just are. I feel like if she passed a 'Yield' sign on a highway, she would ponder on why the sign was there and what the significance of the sign was in her life.....and if she should 'yield' to her feelings and her inner being.....when in fact.....is was just a Yield sign in the road! Lighten up."
2,My Life So Far Continues to be dictated by males,"Jane bemoans her fate over and over and over...her father was distant, she was drawn to men who were equally distant, over and over and over, and she was so taken advantage of. Her lamentations, at her age, get very old.Goodness, she's now 67 years old and still doesn't seem to have a clue. Now she's dipping her toe into the waters of Christianity-- another male dominated culture where women aren't going to receive much, unless they submit their natural intelligence and souls to yet another ""higher"" authority.I give this two stars because of her in-depth, behind the scenes look at the making of ""On Golden Pond"" and ""9 to 5"".Karen AitchisonSan Francisco"
2,Depressing,"Talk about looking for love in all the wrong places. This woman has an unerring radar for obnoxious,over wrought,nutty men. And the killer is that she was still attracting these losers in her 50's.I was exhausted just reading about it.She and Ted Turner actually sound kind of pitiful.Both had dismal childhoods and are still struggling with them 5 decades later.I found it amazing they stayed in marriage counseling 7 out of the 8 years they were married. The ""therapists"" must have made a killing off these two self absorbed neurotics."
1,"liberal malarchy, personally boycotted","I read in a book about john wayne (who patriotically made films suporting the vietnam soldiers) where he came out of a meeting and saw little janie with a bunch of ""flower children"" waving viet-kong flags. He ignored her, and i suggest you do the same for the sake of your mental health."
1,A Proxy for Poor Little Rich Girl,"I call it a proxy, since this self-expose is absent any real feeling about what was in Jane's mind, other than daddy didn't love her enough. One has to figure the drama employed was inserted by a good, real good, editor. Hat's off to him or her, or them.Admittedly, I bought the book to get the chance to look into a dark soul. What makes people like this tick? There isn't much to find there once you sift the real from the expert editor. What made Jane sit smiling on the seat of an NVA anti-aircraft gun used to shoot down US pilots? What made Jane provide several radio Hanoi broadcasts, in which she called US airmen ""criminals""? What made Jane, who met the tortured POW's, call them liars even after their release from their torturous ordeal?You won't find it in this book. Only the highly edited ramblings of a poor little rich girl, who still doesn't get it.Such a shame, I was hoping for more. After all, there is no statute of limitations on treason."
2,Not for me,"I found the book tedious, too detailed, too long and lacking in wanting to read on. That doesn't take away from the fact that I think she is a remarkable woman, but there was a lack of excitement coming from the pages. More like an historical account of her life so far which it is, but it needed some pizzazz.Dr Gunta Krumins-Caldwell author of On Silver Wings"
2,Typical Hollywood Mirror Lover,"Hollywood attracts and develops it's own unique version of hyper narcissism and this book is a poster boy of that. The detail of self analysis is overwhelming at times and reflects a lot of the professional help she obtained during her lifetime to explain and modify her behavior.But no psychologist will ever explain away her treason and extreme damage to our servicemen during her Hanoi visit not to mention some of her outrageous comments and other actions like calling our POWs liars........she knows it, we know it, and God knows it; so I hope she prays for forgiveness a lot before she has to meet him sooner than later one day...........I'd like to be the fly on the wall when she does.........."
1,Ultra portable? Try ultra unreliable.,"The VAIO arrived, looked nice and ran nice for 10 days. Then, the screen went dark. It didn't totally go black -- you could still see the outline of the objects you had on screen -- but too dark for you to be able to see anything. Turns out the inverter board blew out, which is what gives power to the backlight to make your screen bright.Now, I never dropped or mishandled the computer. And for pete's sake, it was only 10 days siince I'd bought it. Ridiculous. Someone who's worked in tech support told me VAIOs are known to have a lot of hardware malfunction and tend to be ""delicate."" I'd return it if I could, but I bought it here on Amazon. Luckily, there was the 1 year warranty.My recommendation is, if you want to try out a VAIO, buy it from a SonyStyle store, so at least you can return it if you decide you don't like it. But the best way to go is to get a different brand notebook altogether and not dealing with the hassle of an unreliable machine."
4,Interesting history,This DVD gives an in-depth look into the recording of some of Elvis' first and most popular hits. I had to wonder why certain individuals were included in the interviews but all-in-all it is a great documentary. I particularly found the DVD extras to be the most interesting.
5,Liddle Griddle,"This is a GREAT product, especially made for 2 people. I cook bacon, pancakes, eggs and anything else that you would cook on a griddle. This little mini-griddle is perfect for cooking for 2 people. This is the 3rd one of these that I've owned. Needless to say it gets a lot of use around our house."
4,small personal size is great,Got this for my mom who wanted a small griddle and I couldn't find one in the stores. Price was good and was the right size. She likes it.
2,Not that I don't it..Company was........,Not too good of service...from the company who was to ship it out..So I got this brand from a another place.....Product is great!!
1,Smells like cat pee,I am not joking..........this stuff makes your house smell like you live with a hundred cats. It smells like when you walk into someones house and they have urine soaked carpets. This smell is foul.
1,Somting else in the bottle,I got this and these don't smell like they should be....also the color of the liquid in the bottle fades after 2 days and no smell either...stay away.
1,Horrible smell,Agree with the other reviewers - this scent is horrible. And it's strong too! I have my plugin set to the lowest setting and it still manages to fill my entire 2 br 1000 sq ft apartment with a strong scent.
4,NTX Metal Polysh,"Easy to use, price is right, good product. A jar of this NXT goes a long way, a lot further than Mother's Billit Polish. Meguiars NXT Polysh works well on metals that don't need much attention. Mother's Billit Polish seams to work much better on heavy tarnished metals. NXT Metal Polysh is a very fine paste, where Mother's Bullit Polish is a paste but doesnt seam as fine as the NXT Metal Polysh. Both work very well on plastic as a cleaner."
1,FLIMSY!,NOT WHAT I THOUGHT I WAS ORDERING-THIS IS BARELY A PAPERBACK BOOK-CONSISTS OF ABOUT 5 FLIMSY PAGES AND AN EVEN FLIMSIER COVER-DISAPPOINTED!
1,BrokeBack Book,"This book came to me falling apart. The spine was not properly attached in the binding process and the pages were falling out. I did not even get the chance to read page one before the middle 5o pages were in my other hand. The publisher of this book is a jankcy crook at best. Of course amazon will take it back, however, they will not refund my overnight shipping charges. What a crock of $#!~. You get the picture."
5,One of a kind,"Having produced such wildly different acts as Prince and the Revolution and the Replacements, for a while in the late 80's and early 90's, the Minneapolis music scene was the next big thing. Among the best bands to come out of that was the eccentric pop quartet Trip Shakespeare. The bands music was strongly influenced by the more experimental pop and rock of the 60's and 70's--the Beatles of Revolver and later albums; The Beach Boys circa Pet Sounds; with perhaps a little Todd Rundgren and Queen thrown in. But the band's sound is always its own, and based solidly on the band's vocal talents, which include brothers Matt and Dan Wilson, and bassist John Munson, all three capable lead vocalists. Lulu is chocked full of pop gems. Check out the title track, along with ""Bachelorette,"" ""Down My Block,"" ""Jill Can Drive,"" and ""Look at the Moon,"" as well as the lyrically incoherent but brilliant ""Your Mouth."""
5,Amazing,I have to tell you...You won't be disapointed. It's Great!!!I listen to it over and over and I never get sick of it. It has a nice mixture of praise and worship and Ricardo's voice is amazing. I say Buy. Enjoy
4,"One of The Most Chilling, and Powerful Records Ever","Onetime Riker's Island prisoner (served 20 months on Riker's Island for robbery in 1988) Intelligent Hoodlum flows with 18-carat insight about inner city agony, holy mess, and the theology of the Nation of Islam. Hoodlum's second album is rather chilling; unapologetic chronicle of ferocious, ugly, gruesome experiences (tearing, intense, terrifying, and funereal type stories!) relayed by someone neither joyous nor regretting what he's seen and heard. The album shows that their was no attempt to charm, overawe, or amuse in his vicious flowing and rhymes; this was just the straight dope."
2,Could use some improvement.,"Works well enough but spacing and orientation of the letters and numbers is difficult. It would work better if the end you hold onto was square, the letters / numbers could only be inserted in 1 orientation, and there was a clamp on guide to increase accuracy. The spring driver is inaccurate."
2,No workie with a Mac.,"Looks like a nice device if you have a PC. Way too many hoops to jump through if you are trying to get it to function with a Mac. The included software was totally useless for a Mac. The Mac can find the device, but the video that came to the computer was unstable, flickered, rolled, or froze with a part frame showing. A color camera was feeding the device and what came out the other end was rather noisy b/w. By no stretch of your imagination is this a plug and play device. I guess I wasn't smart enough.I really wanted this thing to work on a Mac. Be prepared to get royally screwed with returning, shipping, restocking, administrative fees. Read the fine print first."
2,Died after 4 months,"This device worked for about 4 months, then died. It seemed to get very hot. The construction quality is rather poor and there is no venting in the case to permit any kind of airflow. As a result the electronic components seem to have a very short lifespan."
1,"""Worked"" 1 day only","Every half hour it got very hot and image was frozen, then I turned the device off untill the normal temperature was recovered and it began working again. This product worked this way one day only, then died. I don't recommend this product."
3,Pretty Cool Device---Really Needs Firmware Update,"The device works great at digitizing four analog camera inputs and makes it available over the web. You must use Internet Explorer to get the best value out of the device because it requires Active-X. In Firefox (on Linux) the interface is rudimentary at best. I have resorted to using wget to grab images from the device.I planned to hook this up with ZoneMinder, but I need to update the firmware with the Yoics version which was mentioned by other reviewers. Unfortunaely, the first unit came in DOA, and had to be replaced (no problems, just took time), and then when I went to download the Yoics firmware, they have changed the site and I can't get to the firmware. Many requests for help have fallen on deaf ears. Yoics won't even provide an Email address!!I would give it five stars if they had the Yoics firmware already installed!Don't buy this unless you want to use windows and Internet Exploder.Rick"
5,Long Live Irakere,"Although many of my friends hail Afrocubanismo as Irakere's best live album... I refuse to be convinced that it could even hold a candle to Live at Ronnie Scott's. If you don't believe me, just listen to ""Flute Notes""-- a fast-paced adrenaline-rush of a song that switches from a classic Afro-Cuban six-eigths beat, to a powerful son rhythm, to a long flute solo by the one-and-only Orlando ""Maraca"" Valle. It's one of the best Latin Jazz tracks ever made, in my opinion. Irakere itself is a legendary band, so if you haven't yet heard of them, check out some of their studio albums like Yemaya, Misa Negra, or Exuerancia. And when you're ready to find out how they can possibly pull off that kind of excellence on a live stage, Ronnie Scott's is the best place to start."
4,Great collection of recipes with insights on regional styles,"Fun read, with great recipes, a thorough but interesting review of the art of barbecue, and a light-hearted reverence for the cuisine. Plan to pig out before you return this one to the cookbook shelf--it's inspirational, too!"
3,A Good BBQ Sauce Cookbook,"This collection of 128 mops, sops, sauces, and rubs is very good, but not great.It divides itself into sections of sweet, savory (what I would call tangy), ""flamethrower"" (although they all can be tamed by simply reducing the chile pepper amounts), championship, and rub/paste recipes. The listing of individual recipes in the table of contents is a particularly nice feature.The most important part of this book is the 17 championship recipes he teased out of the pros. This must have been a difficult task, since most barbecue aficionados are notoriously secretive. I am most appreciative of this, since these recipes are worth their weight in gold.Although I question some of the recipes, many are worth trying. The chance is very good that you will find something that you will like and keep with you each summer."
2,not the best,they are not the slickest thing to use when you pull the spring you pull the end of the tool away from your work piece making it hard to be precise when you need to be. when i opened the case the center punch and prick punch were dull. buy a normal center punch and hammer
4,Destroying that which came before them,"Ambassador Fereydoun Hoveyda addresses the core of the problems facing Iran, both advertently, and inadvertently.For a more detailed review of this book and a point for point critic of some of the false premises that exist in this book, please visit amiran dot com (forward-slash)/ sphinxUsing this book and its predecessor published a couple of years ago, I try and show the reader, using the authors very own words, their motives, their mistaken assumptions, and it's inevitable consequences.We, the young generation of Iranian's, had to learn the hard way."
5,I would recomend this book to all blacks to read,"I really enjoyed the book, it opened my eyes to a lot of things, that I have heard people talk about for years. every since l was a young girl. it explains and answed alot of questions I had wonder about."
1,"Very disappointing. No new ideas; projects looked ""tacky""","This book was very disappointing. None of the ideas were terribly creative or unique. Many of the suggestions and finished projects looked unprofessional and ""tacky"". Also, there were many typing and editing errors in the copy I received."
2,Started Out Good and then Fizzled,"This book kept my attention for the first two chapters (15 pages). After that, it went downhill fast. There just didn't seem to be any new and exciting ideas that sprung out of this book. In fact, everything this book suggested I had either already tried without success or were so tacky that I wouldn't try them. Bottom line, don't waste your time."
5,Great start to a new life!!,Amazing results if you put the work in! I have tried several other fat burners but this is the first that really helped. It is not a miracle drug but if you excercise you will triple the results. Weigh your self on a monday and start taking pills that day. Weigh yourself again in a week and I will garuntee if you excercised and ate healthy you will be down 5 to 10 Pounds! Very happy with this product.
3,do not do cardio on this,"This may work if you are not doing exercise, but it is dangerous if you are.Normally I do 1 hour of resistance intervals a day, at the end my HR is 163.With this, I can only do 30 minutes and my HR is at 172 !!!!now if you are doing nothing this might curb your appetite as you are basically on herbal speed, but beware exercise. I will say the Xtest formula they make is good though."
5,Truly Inspiring,"This collection truly lifts up the Christian's spirit. It is a masterful blend of inspirational lyrics and artful instrumentality. To me, this album is an evergreen (Nwankama Nwankama). Lest I forget: I recommend it 100%."
3,Mazda 626 Repair Manual,This is the only manual out there for the 626. It's definitely not written for the lay person. It assumes a certain level of knowledge about car repair. So I only use it for the exploded views. Disappointed.
1,Next to useless for a Mazda 626 - not written for this car!,"I wasted a good deal of time following the instructions to remove and replace the starter motor on my 2000 Mazda 626 4-cylinder. What the authors chose not to mention was that the starter in the Mazda 626 is not in the same place as in the example car (Ford Probe), so the Mazda starter cannot be removed and replaced by following the instructions. I removed the entire air intake housing, as instructed, before I figured out that there's no way in hell you can get to the starter from that direction. Ingenious!Maybe this manual is useful for the Ford Probe or MX-6, but it is useless if you want to fix your Mazda 626. I really want to find the publishing executive responsible for this nonsense and throw my old starter through his windshield. Until then, I'll just try to find a manual that is specifically written for my Mazda."
2,What I have come to expect - POOR,Like most car repair manuals this one is not very helpful. This manual is for two very different cars that have the same engine....Talk about cheap. The steps are not always well documented and the few pictures are never of the part you need to see to finish the job and most of the pictures are not even for my car. I hope that someone will make an online or CD-rom version of car repairs that is actual usefully.
2,A Simple Warning about the Font,"I'm giving this book two stars for three reasons. Number one, the font is terrible in this paperback printing. In fact, it may be the worst print I have ever seen in a book. Two, readers who are well read in the subjects of politics and religion will more than likely have read books that provided a much more thorough understanding of worldviews from a biblical perspective. I possibly could recommend the book for beginning students if it were easier to read. Three, I enjoy purchasing good books, but sometimes I'm disappointed. I certainly was in this case."
5,A classic read about families,A well written and interesting perspective on the parent child relationship. I think it is very helpful and would recommend it!
3,book received,Book received well wrapped as promised however pages quite yellowed which was not mentioned. This is a must read book that I often give to others.
4,Great Blues Set,"This is a wonderful mostly blues set with masterful solo work presented by Smith, Turrentine, and guitarist Quentin Warren. Highly recommended listening."
5,"The crossroads of jazz, blues and soul.","If they only has Jimmy Smith playing the organ at my local skating rink when I was a kid, I'd be a much better skater. Jimmy Smith's organ playing is truly sublime and the trio of he, Stanley Turrentine and Quentin Warren is fantastic. This one is a true gem."
1,Not the complete book - only the intro!,"I believe Quality Classics made an error with this book. This version contains only the introduction, and not the whole book.Note that the file size is only 29kb. There are other Kindle versions - check for the the number of printed pages in the book description before you buy."
2,Why did I buy this? For one song or none?,Can't recall why the hype is there for this group as the live sound does not carry over into anything that I would want to hear on the radio or in concert.
4,Early Heavy Metal,"The Who, Led Zeppelin and Humble Pie were, in my opinion, the original heavy metal bands in the late 60's/early 70's. What distinguished these bands from their descendants is that these bands were actually talented. Rockin' The Fillmore is a great example of the original Humble Pie lineup before Peter Frampton left and went pop. For the most part, from ""Four Day Creep"" to ""I Don't Need No Doctor"" it rocks, and begs to be played as loud as possible. Although it is a little too extended, the gem is clearly ""I Walk On Gilded Splinters"" and ""I Don't No Doctor"" suffers from being a little too over jammed, as well. If for no other reason, as an example of early metal, this belongs in every collection, along with The Who Live at Leeds, and the first two Led Zeppelin efforts."
5,Humble Pie at their best!,"This is one of the best albums that ""HUMBLE PIE"" every put out. It is also one of the best ""Live"" albums I have ever heard and I have hearda bunch. I had this on ""8 Track"" when I was in High School and wore it out. IT'S THAT GOOD!!!! A must have for ""HUMBLE PIE"" fans. If you werenever fortunate enough to see them in concert (I saw them in 71') check this out!!!!!!!!!! ROCK ON!!!!!!!!!!"
5,ROCK ON STEVE!!,"It was almost 40 years ago and this album still stands. 1971 was a magical year for so much good music. I must admit, I became a Pie fan when I bought Thunderbox (OK, maybe it WAS for the cover,) but ever since I am coninually amazed by these guys energy and ability. Sad that Frampton was only there for a couple of years but Marriot is a gem not only as a songwriter but his unique voice and guitar slinging carry the day. This is a MUST for any hard rock or music historian for that matter. This live album really captures the energy of the group and the 9 minute I Dont Need No Doctor makes my skin crawl. Marriot once said he would never play Itchycoo Park live (he was with small faces you know), and to my knowlege he never did. Never mind Steve, you became a MONSTER with this amazing performance that night. Thanks for the memories."
4,rockin the fillmore,"what true british rockin blues is all about . steve marriott was at the top of his game, his vocal chops,excellent, kind of grunge before grunge ever existed. laying down the foundation for all the yet unborn seatle posers.its up there with J.Geils ""Full House"" live recording.super high energy that comes right thru the speakers!!!"
5,Nothing Like It These Days,"I bought this album at Sears in 9th grade 30 years ago, and nothing can send chills up the spine like I Don't Need No Doctor. You hear the sound pushing through the microphones. Intense a live performance as it can get. Marriott is pure Pie, RAW, RAMPANT, REAL. Music just isn't made this way anymore. Buy it."
5,humble pies very best,humble pie is one of my favorite bands.they were undoubtedly better live and this record proves it. the best song on there is four day creep the only problem is that its way too short.all the songs are awsome on here esspesialy walk on gilded splinters it takes you through many muscal jams and is worth getting
3,not bad for live,although i am not crazy about some live albums this one gets the big sound and feel across.i think hp was going for there own the who live at leeds sound.they suceed possibly even better with the huge guitar sounds.the only problem is the length of some of the songs with guitar jams.i am not knockin long songs and guitar jams but sometimes if it is not done right it gets old!but for the most part this is a pretty rockin recording.you can hear how this band must have directly influenced everyone from ufo and kiss to the black crows.
5,One of the best albums of all time!,"Especially ""Hallelujah, I love you"" is incomparable for guitar, lyrics and sentiment. WOW!"
2,Don't Be Fooled!,"There is only one version of this gem that is truly worth the listen. And that version is the the 2007 24-bit Japan Mini-Sleeve Remaster. The U.S. release sound quality sucks and the 2006 Japan release is no better. However, the 2007 Japan remaster is greatly improved - a lot more dynamic range - sounds fresh for a 30+ year old live recording. Spend the extra money for this Rock classic, the quality speaks for its self. The 2007 version is out of print, but the search for a used copy is worth the effort!! Two stars for the US and 2006 Japan release - 5 STARS for the 2007 24-bit Japan Mini-Sleeve Remaster! Yes It's that GOOD!!"
3,Oh Simon!,"Oh Simon, you have done it again! Just another Rave Book filled with blah info and very uninteresting. The (Rave) scene is such a fantastic drama, yet few, if any books have yet to capture the essence of what is ""RAVE""Molly"
5,Required reading for the electronic music enthusiast (raver),"Reynolds explores the roots of modern techno culture from first hand experiece. He reflects the point of view from both sides of the Atlantic not as an elated, hallucinigenic, always happy-go-lucky raver but as a music enthusiast (you'll read alot of comparisions to the punk uprising of the late 70's). While you will find alot of positive comments and anectodes in the book, it also explores the other ""not-so-bright"" side of electronic music. If you have been involved with the dance music scene for awhile, you will appreciate the unbiased and insightful tone of the writing, if you are new to the dance music scene or are just curious about what ""the rave"" is about, this is a must read."
3,about rave culture,"The first thing I noticed about this book was its inconsistency. At times Reynolds writes interestingly, but often his style borders on dull. There are some great passages in here. This book covers electronic music, ecstasy, and rave culture. He covers the history as well. I wouldn't say that this is the definitive book on the subject, but well worth a glance through."
2,Boring. Reynolds sucks the life out of an interesting topic.,"Filled with annoying postmodern pseudo-english, Generation Ecstasy seems to be written by someone who desperately wants to be thought of as intelligent. It is a common failing among young professional critics. The formula is simple - merely add a sprinkling of words which refer to anything which has nothing to do with the subject at hand, then throw in some meaningless but intellectual-sounding phrases like, ""translates into a whole new dialectic,"" and voila! Instant tripe! Unless you enjoy watching writers contemplate the contemplation of their navel, forget buying this book. Thinkers should avoid it, but people who think that they are thinkers will probably love it."
4,The first really great book about rave culture I've read,"This is a really lively and provacative book about dance music that goes from its beginnings in the 80s right up to now. Although it has lots of interesting analysis of how drugs affected the music and the scene, it's more focused on the music than anything else. No one else has written about this world as passionately or as clearly as Reynolds has in this book. A few scenes get dealt with too briefly. But I'd definitely recommend it, even if you're just curious about dance music and don't know much about it first hand."
5,Purchased for Art Class,"I teach elementary art and bought this book after seeing another art teacher use it. It's a great book to use for K-1 when discussing pattern, color, or texture. It's also really short, so I scanned the pages to put into a powerpoint so all the students could easily see the pictures. Very cute story, and it's an easy one to let the students read round-robin style."
5,Interesting change of pace for Hillerman.,"I've been reading a lot of novels lately. 600-pagers. So when I found this collections of short stories, I gave it a try. I love the West; I love short stories; why not a change of pace. Hillerman has collected stories set in the West, not western stories. At first I bridled: Hillerman without Navajos? But once I got into the first story, I was hooked. This is the only collection I have ever read whose stories are ALL good, and there are a lot of stories in the book. I liked the characters, the locations, the stories, and the surprise that most of the stories were by women. I hadn't expected that. A favorite? That would be tough. How about three: ""Nooses Give"" by Dana Stabenow--ridding the Tundra of bootleggers; ""A Woman's Place"" by D. R. Meredith--Highwater, Texas never saw no lady judge before!; and ""With Flowers in Her Hair"" by M. D. Lake--you CAN go back, but it may not be very nice there. What did I hate about the book? Closing the back cover."
3,The Mysterious West - book evaluated by Tony Hillerman and has several short stories written by western writers.,The book arrived in the alloted time. It is in good shape and seems to be as stated. I have read just the first 3 stories and have been disappointed in all three. I hope the next ones are better.;
3,The Mysterious West,"Instead of throwing this item in with Hillerman's works, Amazon should have clearly highlighted that this was not WRITTEN by Hillerman, but is an anthology EDITED by him."
1,good bad and ugly,"The book is in excellent condition and arrived earlier than expected but the reader reviews were misleading. Some of the short stories are full of bad language and unnecessary violence. An excellent writer, Hillerman, has put his name on a book of garbage."
2,The Mysterious West - Tony Hillerman and others....,"Book written by other people, and is not as good as his usual.Guess we are hooked on the Chee books!"
5,Re-Release! Re-lease! Also the DVD!,"The best ever panorama of the alternative (then) music scene in the early 80's. The Police in top (then) form. Devo when Devo WAS Devo. The Cramps in a completely obscene performance. Lost gems like Au Pairs, Athletic Spizz, Alley Cats and others lost in the battle to limelight. Can't recommend it enough. I do have the double-vinyl (not for sale) AND the VHS but we really need the CD (extra, previously unreleased tracks???) and DVD."
5,A Classic Live Forever,"Please Please Please, this cd is a classic for new wave and punk lovers. Re-issued please"
5,Worked as described. :),"I wasn't counting, but I think I pulled about 20,000 pages off this drum before it died. But with all drum units, reman'd or not, the number of pagers you get from it depend on the types of jobs you're doing. It doesn't last as long if you print one page at a time -- i.e., the drum heats up and cools down per page. I print about 500 pages per job most of the time, which is probably why I managed 20,000 pages. But please don't rate this thing poorly just because you *thought* it was a genuine Brother product. It's not, and it doesn't claim to be, but it does the job quite adequately.Remember that there are a LOT of manufacturers out there that make non-OEM parts/accessories for everything from printers to cellphones. ALWAYS read the description carefully before ordering, and never rate a product poorly because you didn't read thye entire description."
5,Good buy................. ............... .... ....... ........ .......... ......... ......... ......... ......... ..... .....,Good buy................. ............... .... ....... ........ .......... ......... ......... ......... ......... ..... ..... ccc cccc .... . .. . . .
4,One Strike then a hit,The first drum i was sent did not work at all. They replaced it and the second one worked fine.
5,awesome,This add on is serious thing for serious flight sim gamer! Must have!! I have used one and it made a huge difference!!!
2,Maybe I'm just old and cranky....,"...but it just seems to me that $$$$ is the driving force behind baby boomer, but particularly Beatles, reissues. This has never been released on video, to my knowledge, so it is an event. And it's nice to get the bonus stuff. But I think the pricetag is out of line, priced too high just because they know they can get it.It just seems a shameless ripoff (kinda like gas prices). I mean, these guys all donated their time, played for no pay, to benefit a country in need. This kind of greedy, self-serving pricing seems at horrible odds with the original intent of the concert itself. People say this was the Live Aid template. The Live Aid DVD came out last March, a 4 DVD set that is priced at half of what this set is.Something's terribly wrong here."
2,Stick with the CD,"The Concert for Bangladesh presents what must have been an incredible event to witness in person, but the film is weighed down by static photography and an overall sense of disinterest on the part of the DP. It's fine for insomniacs, but those of us who are not battling sleeplessness will do better by spending less for the spectacular-sounding CD"
1,Terrible,"This dvd was just awful. I thought I would purchase this dvd for my father. Well big mistake that was!!! This was back in his era and a few big names. It was the biggest waste of money. They are all on lsd, high as kites and could not get a note out if it killed them.All the reviews said great but now I know not to take notice. Please spend your money on something else worth while."
4,george does what it does best help other's,"george harrison and a whole host of friends do a ""concert for the poor people of bangladesh"" when i got this for christmas i couldn't wait to see harrison and his host of friends play with the energy of ten thousand men's as i've got the vinyl box set i know what the musical quality was like, i know that was gonna be fantastic and harrison clapton starr, and the rest play beautifully...the highlight of the DVD for me anyway was ravi shankar indian set at the beggining wonderful and magical playing[I LOVE indian music] so peacful and relaxingand the other highlight was bob dylan's set playing classicsetc blowin' in the wind, a hard rain's gonna fall, it takes alot tolaugh it takes a train to cry, blowin' in the wind, just like a women,george harrison doing what he does best..do things for others"
4,I'll tell you where you can still get this great video...,"First of all, to make this a good review, I'll give a few of myimpressions. Bob Dylan and most of the performers here all do a great job, all at their peak. George Harrison is included in that, but Clapton has been better. This concert occurred shortly after the breakup of ""Derek and the Dominos"" (perhaps the best short-lived group of all-time), and Clapton was just reaching the depths of his dibilitating heroin addiction. He had stopped playing music and spent the bulk of his time at his home, and only came because his friend George Harrison was putting the whole thing together. This was Eric's last public performance until Pete Townshend dragged him back onstage for the famous Rainbow Theater concerts in December of 1973 (which effectively sent him back into the studio and onto a great solo career as well). Still, a great video, and a definite must-have..."
3,Needs to be on DVD,"I also saw this in '72 at the theater and cannot understand why it's not available either. The cd was recently re-issued and after George died I read somewhere that this would out on DVD after this first of the year(this year), it ain't happened. Been waiting for this DVD for years."
5,"IF YOU'RE A GEORGE HARRISON FAN, YOU GOTTA HAVE IT!!!",This is a great memoir about George Harrison. This was the greatest thing he's ever done. I wish it would come out on dvd. I miss George Harrison very much and also John Lennon.
5,Some performances you need to really watch to appreciate.,"I remember when the original ""Concert For Bangladesh came out on 3 LP discs (Vynal record albums for the young uns). I played them over & over again...except side 1. I just couldn't appreciate the music of Ravi Shankar (It just sounded like a lot of noise to me back then). I don't know if it had to do with the aging process, or watching the performance, but the Shankar part is one of the most fascinating parts of the concert. At one point, it almost looks like a duel between Shankar (on sitar), and the sarod player. And the Tabla player is excellent. Had I not SEEN it, I never would have appreciated it. (I think I'll take a second look at my Monterey Pop film).The sound & picture are clean. The performance (a real piece of history) should be in anyones collection."
3,Don't sprout so easily,"I don't know if it's the variety or a problem with the batch I got, but sprouting is only sporadic- I have a freshlife automatic sprouter and generally I get great results, but not with these."
4,"Holly would, if she could...","This is my first time reading a Capote work and I was just dying to see if the book was anything at all like the movie--it was. But I like the movies ending better! Very imaginative storyline-Holly is larger than life and that is truly the way I like my fiction characters. Overall a good read. The short stories that followed were quite good, too."
2,The point??,"I was really looking forward to reading this book because of the hysteria surrounding the movie, although I haven't seen it. I was sorely disappointed with what I was presented with. While the writing in itself is very good, I fail to see the point?? Sorry"
3,Boring,Boring from the first go and quite unreadable as you go along few pages - and that's an effort to say the least. Leon Uris would have done a much better job with the same subject matter. I am giving it 3 stars because Vidal exposed the nexus between business and Government in subjugating downtrodden people.
3,My ears are bleeding.,"Ok, I like this kind of music - avant garde, free jazz. And this music is a great example of quality jazz. However, these Rudy Van Gelder recordings are highly overrated. The first track on this CD sounds like they stripped the bass out the mix and jacked up the treble. Your first response is to bolt out of the listening chair to turn down the volumn. How does a recording that is supposedly ""remastered"" end up this way?"
1,Massive difference between music and mere pointless noodling,My review's title says it all. Extremely disappointing.
5,A MASTERPIECE!,"This is not just simply one of the best jazz CDs,but one of the greatest music statements in the 20th century.It's timeless.You can listen to it many times and each time it sounds fresh and gives you deep esthetic satisfaction of something fully and deeply accomplished.Don't be fooled after the first listening!The music will open itself after several listenings.Take your time and you will be rewarded.A true MASTERPIECE!!!"
1,Dull and Pretentious,"The author's style of writing is difficult to follow. The story seemed convoluted, oft times making no sense. The character developement suffered at the expense of the author's desire to show her ""knowlege"" of the era. Author's review promised a book that ""yields spiritual wisdom and promises to stay long in the mind."" There was no spiritual wisdom, and the only thing that stayed in my mind was the fact that I had wasted money on this book."
1,Knock Off,"A cheap imitation of the original. The front cover broke off my phone within a day, and off my wife's in two. A waste of money. The original snap-on cover is thicker and clicks into place snugly."
1,Brittle Plastic,I have tried two cases and both have brittle plastic. The case part that fits on the top of the RazorV3 will crack in a couple of days! It will fall off the flip top.
2,Nice product but breaks very easy,This case was cracked when I received it and broke completely within a week. I love the case but it just needs to be little more sturdy.I would and will buy another hopefully the next one will not be cracked when I receive.
1,It sucks..,"I purchase this to protect my Razor phone, and I have only had it a month and the piece that covers the screen, the clips have broken off and the case has cracked. I have NEVER EVER dropped my phone or abused it - but the case is so cheaply made that it looks like it's been dropped and kicked! I would not reccommend this product to ANYONE."
3,sexy but too small,"when i bought this item i know i got at least a medium cuz i know im not a small, but they sent me a small anyway. i think i might have been able to sqeeze myself into it but i would have looked ridiculous so if your planning on getting this get one size bigger- you can tie it tighter in the back. it looks very sexy and although he didnt get to see it on me, my husband loved the way it looked."
3,just a suggestion...,"i NEED new rotors but i may not buy this one/these ones....? get it? is this for the front? the back? why not sell them as a pair if they are for the front? may have to pass this one up, there for you lost a sale because of bad description."
4,The legend of Arthur lives on!,"This 250 page book is the companion for the Arthurian Tarot Deck. For those who own the deck I am sure this is a long-awaited book. The charm of the legend is undeniable as it retells the history of the goddess in a romantic fashion. Ms. Ferguson relates the legends of Arthur as she details the meanings of each card which is why this book is so detailed. Incredibly she does this with the entire deck. It represents allot of hard work and thought on her part as she extends to the reader her visions of the legend taking them well beyond the ordinary meaning of the tarot cards, into the realm of fantasy and mythos. Ms. Ferguson is an incredible storyteller!"
3,A Keeper of Words,"This book is not what I thought it would be. I'm very into connecting intuitively with Tarot or any other oracle cards and I've had a great deal of success with that. I thought this was an actual accompanying book of the Authors journey; it is basically a ""how to read the meaning of the cards"" book. It may be good for someone who is a beginner, but I wouldn't suggest it to someone who is a seasoned reader. It does however have some snippets of information that some may find interesting but its important to draw the truth out of the information and leave the rest behind. I do appreciate the work and energy the Author has put into the book."
4,Loving it.,Great game. Love how it plays. Highly recommend it to all my friends and anyone who happens to be a NASCAR fan.
4,Great,"I'm not a huge Nascar fan, at least I wasn't before meeting my father&brother-to-be. However, I love video games, and racing ones. Christmas was coming up, and I had a pretty good flow of money, so I decided to splurge a little and make it a good holiday (as it had been canceled due to my family's money-issues and such). I bought this for my father, and he's already played it a bunch of times, and he's not much of a gamer, at all. He loves the action, and the real-life-like effects. I'm glad I bought it. It's a good series overall, actually. I've got 07 and 09 as well. Love 'em all."
2,"ok, but not great!","I bought this product because I have liked all the nascar games, but this would be the first nascar game that i have purchased for the playstation 2. all my other games were for the xbox. well i realy liked the graphics and choice of the car of tommorow, but the ps2 controler for the game sucks. I gues i will have to purchase a game wheel and try it out, but to everyone who is thinking about purchasing this for the ps2 and using the regular controler, purchase a wheel first. see on my xbox controler you have rt triger finger controlls the gas and you can press down on it half way and get half throtle, on the ps2 its either throtle or nothing."
2,Not So Beyond Anything,"The plot is very thinly developed. It plays out as if someone stole a copy of the first stage of brainstorming for a Final Fantasy game--i.e. very weak and underdeveloped. It might have had some merit if the developers had simply scratched below the surface of the storyline and given it some depth. Although it does feature some hidden optional characters, the time between save points can be frustrating."
1,Try something else,"I own this game, and it is not worth the time and effort. the story leaves a lot to be desired. there were better games for the genesis, super nintendo than this game. After playing it for 30 minutes, i packed it up and walked away. you will be truly dissappointed by this"
1,"The Slow side of Marduk,Really slow",I hate to say it but La Grande is a real disappointment. From the weak into to the slow breakdowns played alll the time on this disc. I would suggest picking up a good Marduk CD like Panzer Division Marduk.
2,Er.....,"Really a let down from panzer..which is my one of my favorite metal album that uses war for its theme...Marduk can write some good songs, but i agree with that person about the poserness of them,they seem to attract morons. What really pissed me off was a review in metal maniacs telling us not being able to call yourself a black metal fan if you dont love marduk! drats!i better go buy all their albums! but i already have a fridge full of CHEESE. I think swedish black metal is some of the cheesiest ever. They should stick to death metal,but Thats what i get for reading metal maniacs though. Anyway, like i said , they can put out good songs but this one isnt good at all."
4,""" Wuthering Heights "" was a depiction of Bronte's life.","I have recently done a research project on Emily Bronte; the time period, and her life in conjunction with the novel Wuthering Heights. I view Wuthering Heights as a wonderful publication, though not conforming to the Victorian literature of the time. Emily Bronte's characters, Heathcliff, and Catherine Earnshaw were both cold-shouldered to the rest of the world. The selfish nature of the both, made it impossible for love and true happiness to be found."
3,Catherine has two different love affairs,"After reading Wuthering Heights it is obvious that Catherine Earnshaw loved both men equally although in different ways. Heathcliff is her childhood lover, a love based upon pain and hurt and the denial of a mother's love. They comfort each other and they are soul mates. However, as Catherine matures, she realizes that she is not the wild child of the moors but instead she is a part of society and she must adapt to society's values. Edgar is her adult lover, and his love is necessary to help her discover her identity as a woman and as a member of society. Catherine loves both men, although she loves them in different ways."
3,"Catherine is in love with Heathcliff, but can't marry him","Catherine is in love with Heathcliff, but she knows that the best person for her would be Edgar. When Heatcliff comes back, she knows that she has made a big mistake. Heathcliff is disturbed after Catherine dies."
1,"A Dreary Tale of Love, with moments of insight","As a work of entertainment literature, this book is dry, boring, slow, and not worth reading. All of the characters are hateful, and unrealistic. Now, I'm not going to lie to you, it has many interesting philisophical concepts. Some of which are love, the supernatural, and human nature, however, the book was so uninteresting, and depressing, I would have rather read it out of a textbook. Bottom line - Hopefully I'm just a shallow uncultured reader, and you will find much more enjoyment in it than me."
3,There's a better Joe Henderson during this era...,"Although there's a reluctance to go against the grain of the reviews listed above for this session...understand, it's a sterling recording, great muscianship, and typically studly Joe Henderson as leader material, but it is respectfully submitted that the album tends to be somewhat bland. The Leader does his best work in a quintet, sextet or more instrument setting, and this recording seems to support the supposition. Of course, there is and will probably not be a quartet of the likes of John Coltrane's classic set, so any comparison is inherently unfair. As great as Mr Henderson is, this recording does not demand one's attention throughout. Perhaps it's the compositions. However, I'd still listen to it over just about any other tenor leader work of the mid 60s. Hey, genius calls for tough critique."
2,History Of Talk Radio,"Too much New York bias (and I'm an ex-New Yorker who listened to the profiled personalities in my youth) hurt this effort. Tom Leykis and the late great Jean Shepherd were conspiciously missing. The Chicago School (Studs Terkel) wasn't on this video tape at all. In short, this film was a flawed effort, a disappointment."
1,Very poor packaging,My one star rating is Because I received the product and a horrible packaging! The box look like it when Thripp shredder was all taped up and half the box was missing and the other Half tape
5,Tackling a Difficult Question,"Although Father Hauser does not give a simple definitive answer to the question of why God allows evil, pain, and suffering,he does work through his own experiences in dealing with a tragic accident which happened to students on the campus where he is teaching. He analyzes varous responses from his students to this kind of personal loss and suggests ways of dealing with the question. I personally found his careful treatment of our understanding of and reacton to suffering very helpful if not completely satisfying. I certainly recommend this book highly for anyone struggling to reconcile God's love and goodness with evil in the world."
4,A fun read,"when I read The sherbrooke Bride I didn't know that It was a scries. As usual Ms.C has mixed love and confict, with alittle humor mixed in to keep you turning the pages. Once again If you are a fan, or if you have never read Ms. C.'s books this is a must read. Once you have you will start looking for others. I just finished not loge ago The Scottish bride and found it just as good and the first."
1,Coulter's Worst,"Even though I am a huge fan of Coulter's, this book has to be her worst! While I agree with the other reviewers about the horrible ""hero"", I would be remiss if I didn't say anything about the ""heroine."" Katharine was a mouse. I understand her pain, but eventually you just have to move on. In fact, Coulter should never have even written about this. It is not romantic for the heroine to be ""wacky"" every time the hero touches her. Don't waste your time on this one. It is neither romantic nor sexy. It is psychology 101."
1,A really horrible book,"Don't buy this book, I did and I really regret it. It's about a heroine who was sexually abused as a child, but who doesn't remeber it until her (loving ! ) husband rapes her, because he can't wait for her to come to him on her own good time (she has reasons to draw back, even if she doesn't remember them at first). He abducts, blindfolds and rapes her while pretending to be a Swiss robber, which creates in plus the problem, that, since she becomes pregnant because of this, she sinks in utter misery and loses the child, nearly dying in the whole process. This is when the hero admits that he was the rapist (he knows she is pregnant and crying her heart out, but no, he won't tell her before). After all this, she thinks she loves him ! (She must be a masochist). In all: avoid this book, I had nightmares after reading it and the deep felt wish to string up the hero."
2,Very disappointing,"Catherine Coulter is a great writer and one of my favorite. This book however disappointed me greatly. I have to agree with the other reveiwer who thought it was horrible the way her loving? husband raped her while pretending to be someone else. Blindfolding her, just imagine what she must of went through after being abused as a child. All of this would have been acceptable since this is only a book, but he was portrayed as a good guy when he actually was a scoundrel. Catherine has written much better books. I am not sorry I read it, because I want to read all her books, just disappointed. I must add she is still one of my favorites, you can't like them all."
1,Very Disappointing!,"I usually love all the fighting that goes between the hero & heroine, but I for once have to say that in this book I hated it, it was just too much.I also have to agree with other reviews the rape part was awful!I didn't like this book at all!"
2,Not A True Romance (Contains Spoilers),"I thought this book was all right until suddenly the main male character, Julien, abducts and rapes his wife. I was rather shocked that this would be in what's supposed to be a ROMANCE novel! Rape isn't romantic. And talk about helping to keep the erroneous view going that when a woman's being raped, she'll come around and start enjoying it. I would definitely not recommend this book, when there are so many more options out there. Definitely don't waste your time/money!"
1,What can I say?,What can I say about this book that's good? I pondered this question after I got through half of it and knew that I couldn't finish it. It's full of cliches and the dialogue at times made me laugh out loud. I know this book was a revamp of a work the author had published years ago. That in itself makes me wonder how bad it was to start.
2,Not her best work,"Catherine Coulter has proven to be an iffy read. You are pretty safe with her modern mysteries, but her historical romances often dissolve into trite, wooden and unbelievable dialogue. In my opinion, her Bride trilogy was her best work in the historical romance genre. The family was interesting, and she did a good job of involving all of the family members in each of the books. This one probably isn't worth it unless you get it at the library or buy it used."
1,"""Hero"" is a nasty MCP egotistical jerk; I'm thowing this book in the trash","this book deserves less than a single ""star"" for an egotistical ""hero"" with a really nasty streak. He's a jerk, who thinks it will arouse his unwilling wife if he rapes her in ""disguise"". This book is not a ""romance"" by anyone's definition. I usually trade my used books in, but this one is going in the trash where it belongs."
1,CD Fan,"I have recently baught this item and at first i thought of it as a very good cd player but it [isn't]!! the volume is not even loud enough the so called tuner doesn't even get my stations and it skips all the time, also the remote broke the first time i used it . At first i thought panasonic was a good brand but not anymore they just lost a customer and please do not buy this product!!."
3,This thing rocks!,"I completely dig this thing. I like to use it while I exercise and it is perfect. It lets me enjoy my favorite music no matter what I'm doing: jogging, biking, mowing the lawn, or just sitting on the beach. The anti-skip feature is great for jogging. My last player used to driv me crazy because it was constantly skipping while I jogged."
4,"Good Live Concert, But Not Great","I've been a fan of the Foo Fighters since the beginning and I still find the first three albums to be the best. So when I saw a live performance of them from the legendary wembley stadium I knew it had to be great. Well while the performance was good I fell Dave is trying a little hard with his expansions in terms of the new sounds he's added. I myself prefer the songs without the addition of violin, pianos, and keyboards. However seeing the legendary Jimmy Page and John Paul Jones perform two of Led Zeppelins best songs with the Foo Fighters made up for this/ Overall a good concert, that for met at least falls just short of being great."
4,Foo Fighters - Live at Wembley Stadium,"This is a GREAT show. The performance content on this disc lives up to the standard that I've come to expect from all things Foo Fighters. My rating for it would've been a full 5 stars if there had been more background / special features / interviews with the band, about this show. The Foo's rock-umentary ""Back And Forth"", which I highly recommend, covered a good bit of background on the 2 performances at Wembley."
4,Great Concert DVD,"This is a ""must have"" for any Foo Fan! The sound, camera angles, lighting, and set list are very well done. It was a great night for the band. It's worth it just to see Dave cry!"
3,"Good Concert,But...","I would like to give this disc a solid 4 stars but can only bring myself to give it 3. Why, you may ask? Well, sadly it's Grohl's foul mouth. I've spent my working life in garages,mills & factories so I'm well accustomed to swearing, & I can swear with the best of them when I'm really excited or angry, but that doesn't mean I like to hear it from entertainers who have no real reason to be cursing. I easily forgive the odd curse or two from anybody, but Grohl is one of these guys that can't complete a full sentence without dropping a f-bomb or two. Sad really, in an adult(he's not alone , we have an old acquaintance who's no better). I now know that the explicit advisory on the cover is well earned. 30 or so fewer f-bombs would have made this a much more enjoyable concert to watch. I suppose I'm in a minority with Foo Fighter fans but thought I should throw my 2 cents worth in there. I'll certainly watch this again but my finger won't be far from the ff button."
4,Cheaper than tickets and worth it,"Let me just say I purchased this right after going to their concert. This concert at Wembley Stadium is considered by the Foo Fighters as when they knew they had made the big time. You could tell that they were basking in the moment. The performance is great. They played a long set and you will hear your favorite song as they played it all. I disagree with the review that the sound was not good. We watch this in surround sound and it is just like being there. Probably better because you can hear the words. At the concert, the music drowns out the lyrics."
5,Great Stuff,"Yes, this is a must-have for Foo Fighter fans. Granted, it doesn't sound as well as the studio recordings, but it's not bad. Also, it's entertaining to hear a couple of the songs in a semi-unplugged state.The appearance of John Paul Jones (Led Zeppelin) and Jimmy Page (Led Zeppelin, The Yardbirds) for two songs is great. The concert is something that Dave Grohl says we'll be talking about for 20 years. He also says it's the best day of his whole life. That says a lot about how much it means to him/them. Check it out."
4,Foo Away,Wembly has always been on of my favorite stages and the Blue Ray does full justice to not being there in person.Foo Fighters as a group is uber cool
2,read Skid Road instead,"Last summer I read the excellent history of Seattle ""Skid Road,"" by Murray Morgan, and I thought that I'd try William Spiedel's book for some pleasure reading this summer, and I'm so far extremely disappointed. It is nearly unreadable, and pales in comparison to Morgan's acclaimed history. Spiedel is not a gifted writer, and the book is chopped up into two and three sentence paragraphs that do not blend together smoothly. His attempt to write a humorous and somewhat subversive history of Seattle intrigued me, but he tries much too hard to amuse, and the book is marred by disorganization, flippant appraisals of such luminaries as Doc Maynard and Chief Sealth, and hints of racism. I doubt I will finish it."
5,PLEASURE FOR THE SOUL,"AGAIN ROLAND CLARK HAS DAZZLED ME WITH HIS LOVELY HARMONY. I FEEL UPLIFTED EVERYTIME I HEAR HIS VOICE WEITHER IT'S FALSETTO OR ALTO, EVEN BETTER HIS LYRICS ALLWAYS HAVE DEEP PURPOSE AND ALWAYS PUT ME INTO A TRANCE. HE ALSO PROVES HIMSELF TO BE A POETIC WRITER. I'M SURE ANYONE WHO ENJOYS MEANINGFUL SONGS WILL ENJOY THE WORKS OF MR.CLARK"
5,This is a great documentary,"It tells the story of what some of his most noticed songs were about. It gives you insight on what was happening in Nick Drakes career. They discuss songs like River man, Fruit tree, Parasite, pink moon, when the day is done, and many more. The DVD is focused on Nick Drakes influences and the three first albums along with his last four songs he was working on before he died. The DVD is worth the purchase. All nick Drake fans should buy this DVD."
3,"""Not authorized by the Estate of Nick Drake...","...nor by Island Records."" It should be noted that while this is an interesting piece with some insight, the above words, taken directly from the back cover, might give some people pause before purchasing it, as this goes against the wishes of the keepers of the Drake flame, his sister Gabrielle, Joy Boyd, and Cally, the guy behind the official remasterings and other ""official"" projects. A very interesting interview with Cally that touches on some of these issues can be found at: [...]"
5,Very Funny For The Price,"Ludvik Vaculik is perhaps one of the funniest Czech writers to come out of Prague Spring. Writing under the censor, Vaculik manages to merge a thoroughly disturbing tale of animal cruelty with a physical rendition of the chaotic Czech currency system of the time. But one doesn't have to know anything of the history of Czechoslovakia or communist censorship to enjoy this story. It's very funny and unsettling all the same. Highly recommended."
4,Great intro for the future,This book was a great way to understand where fibre channel isnow and where it is going. As an integrator. . . of fibre channel and SANs it helped me gain perspective on how my designs today will be applicable tomorrow.
2,Steinhausen Quad Pretty Box disguises substandard mechnics,"I purchased this product in November of last year. The wood finish is very striking, and at first the four, individual watch winders performed as advertised. However, about 8-9 mos after purchase the winders started to fail one by one. Now, at month 14 only one of the four watch winding mechanisms still works. I've treated the box exceptionally well, and it has not been moved or damaged since it arrived. I'd strongly recommend against purchasing this product, and suggest seeking a different brand of watch winder, one with mechanics as sound as the watches you are seeking to preserve."
1,Junk,"I purchased this brand of watch winder couple years ago. Needless to say, it lasted a few months and I ended up giving it to Goodwill because it stopped working. I needed a watch winder and Not a watch case! Don't waste your money on this brand."
1,Steinhausen Burl Wood Quad Watch Winder,"I bought this to keep my Invicta 9937, my Invicta Ocean Ghost, as well as my Son's Seiko Orange Monster. It was incapable of keeping those Watches wound, even when it was NEW! Over the course of around 12-14 Months - one by one, 3 of the Winder Modules ceased working. I am now down to 1 Working Module. I was able to contact the Company and they quoted repairs @ $50.00/Module but, I would have to ship it to them for repair. I can't in good conscience recommend this product."
2,Not too groundbreaking,"Although it covers an interesting topic, the text is neither groundbreaking or full of new ideas. It brings together facts in a relatively mundane way that does not do it's subject justice. I envisioned a much more informative and entertaining book. I would pass unless you want a dry depiction of some of the most exciting happenings in world history."
1,NOT RECOMMENDED Groundbreaking Scientific Experiments 18th C,"Having bought other books in this series, I was extremely disappointed in this vague attempt. It is ashame one author did not do the entire series. It seems everything is lacking in this 18th century book, including the index and contents. It is unfortunate I cannot recommend this particular book of an otherwise superb series."
5,Great Read!,"I really appreciated the meal planning sections of this book. Although you know you're supposed to be eating this many servings of this or that, it can be really hard to figure out how to put those into your day. This book does a lot of the planning for you. It even gives helpful tips for eating on the go or out and about. The recipes are pretty yummy, although not all of them were my favorite."
5,Staple Reading,"In shopping on-line for a shower gift, I was delighted to find this new and revised edition of the same book I used with my own pregnancy six years ago. When it arrived, I took the time to read through it and was delighted to find many new features, info and recipes--all in the calm, expert and experienced voice of the authors. Needless to say, in fear of dog-earring the gift copy too much(!), I reluctantly wrapped it up for my friend. Well, she and her spouse, who loves to cook and eat well, are raving about it and promise to lend it to me for the recipes--esp. the vegetarian/vegan ones. Both of our families are making the transition to an all-plant diet. Regardless of dietary preferences, this book should be a staple in any pregnant or ""thinking-about-becoming-pregnant"" woman's (and her partner's) reading list."
5,Tasty and nutritious!,"This is a great cookbook. I especially love their breakfast recipes - the whole wheat pecan waffles are to die for. The recipes are honestly family friendly, and many of them use ingredients that most people have on hand. I think the only thing I had to buy specifically for the first 4 recipes I tried was plain yogurt. I had everything else on hand already. That never happens!The book lists some nutrition info for each recipe, but not a whole lot. It tells you which vitamins the prepared food provides for your baby and why they're important, but you really don't have to be pregnant to enjoy the food presented. The only thing I wish it had was a better table of contents. Recipes can be difficult to find within the book."
3,Just Another Cookbook,"Not what I was looking for. I wanted something that would give example menus for a day of healthful pregnancy eating. This is a collection of recipes much as would be found in any other cookbook with a healthy bent. The recipes are fine. The nutritional information section is fine. But nothing I couldn't have accomplished with the pregnancy books I already have plus a half-way decent cookbook. If you have, for example, What to Expect When You're Expecting and The Joy of Cooking, this will bring nothing new to your arsenal."
3,Good,"Buy it for the shopping lists and healthy recipe ideas. The general nutrition information is much the same that you can pick up on the various internet sites (APA, bump, etc)"
2,"Just a cookbook, really.","This is a nice cookbook, but not much more. It does include some nutritional information in the introduction, but the information is VERY basic and not so up-to-date. If you are looking for a decent cookbook, then this book maybe right for you. If you are looking for more of a nutritional guide to pregnancy, then look elsewhere."
2,Adequate information,"Wasn't just what I expected. Did not find the book very useful. Then again, I'm a very picky eater."
5,Easy and Informative!,"Eating for Pregnancy: The Essential Nutrition Guide and Cookbook for Today's Mothers-to-BeThis book is easy to read, and full of good information. It reminds me to eat a more healthy and balanced diet. The recipes and menus come complete with caloric and nutritional information. I especially like the vegetarian menu ideas!"
3,ILOK needed with MAC Leopard OS,"I bought the Synthogy ivory pianos. The description didn't say I need the ILok. I got the software, tried to install it and nothing. Looked through the manual and nothing about the ilok was under ""requirements"" which is where I would assume the ""requirements"" for running the program would be. I called support and they told me I need to buy the ILok. Mac osx wouldn't run without it.I understand the need for security and fighting piracy, but it is frustrating. At the very least they should include in the software if you HAVE to have it to run the program. At the very least, make sure it's listed clearly so people know before they buy it.Besides the added expense of the software, the ILok takes up a USB port that usually contains my back up drive.If I had known this ahead of time, I probably would have gone with the acoustik pianos."
3,Wont help you pass the A+ core exam,"i just recently took the A+ exam and passed with no thanks to this book --its not detailed to fit the exam, i wouldnt recommend this as a study guide. i studied from the examnotes.com which was really helpfull i just purchase A+ for dummies to study for the dos/win half. Its seems helpful so far"
3,Some errors that should not have happened,"In the 1st chapter of this book we are told that single-sided disks are the 320/360K disks and the double sided are the 1.2 meg disks. This is incorrect. The single-sided disks, of ancient history, are the 160/180K disks, the double-sided are 320/360K and the double-density disks introduced the 1.2 meg disks. Also, on the Interactive Study portion of the CD-ROM it is not possible to choose an incorrect answer and go to the text. The only active links are to the correct answers which makes this feature quite useless for the user wanting to truly test him/her self."
4,Johnny Cash Fan,"Just bought this CD. I have one other Cash CD. This is a CD of his years at Sun Recording Studios. One can hear his love for gospel music in Belshazzar. That classic boom-chick-a-boom Cash sound as very pervilant in this cd. His man was a great story teller. My favorite songs are Cry, Cry, Cry & Folsum Prison Blues. ""I Love You Because"" features Jerry Lee Lewis on piano. That's cool."
3,A book in two parts,"This was a strange book as the first half of it was excellent and the author spun some interesting tales about a pair of old-time boxers and the rise of his own boxer.Then at about the half-way mark, the lustre of the book seems to fade and it becomes fairly mundane. It is almost as if the author lost the energy to write as well as he had for the second half as he did for the first half.Disappointing."
4,then don't drink it so quickly!!,"Funny book, great perspective on boxing, I just wish he'd put a bit more about some of the incidents he witnessed and people he met. The talk about the trip to Cuba was pretty saddening. Quite different from standard boxing books, but very enjoyable!"
3,A vivid description from inside boxing's unique subculture,The underside of the boxing world from seedy gyms in London and NY to the Vegas fight scene is examined in this book. It is interesting for even a casual boxing fan because it describes how boxing chews people up and spits them out. Very few recieve the lasting notoriety of an Ali or a Foreman. The death this week of Jerry Quarry who suffered terribly from brain damage sustained during his boxing career and the sad stories in this book have convinced me that boxing should be banned.
3,Good,I got this in no time at all but the box was really badly torn and it had been taped up I hate when I have broke DVD boxes.
1,Defective,Item was defective. Some episoldes would not play at all or just stopped in the middle. I contacted vendor and was told to return for refund. I mailed the item back and have not yet received a refund.
2,Crappiest transfer ever,"My wife loves the show and that's why I bought this for her. Picture quality is terrible. It's like watching an analog transfer of a very old movie tape. Images are grainy. You can actually see small black dots seeding the entire screen. And believe me, this is not my TV, it's HBO!"
2,it's all pixelated,"I can't return this item cause i'm in south america and i supposed it would be expensive but this dvd looks dark, all pixelated and doesn't have spanish subtitles"
4,Super speedy arrival!,"Came exactly as described and on time. I'm very satisfied with this purchase. The discs are in very good condition and the case is as well, for the most part. Thanks!"
5,Amazing!,"This item I had gotten used, and I opened it and loved it! I checked the case and DVD and nothing wrong......There is 2 disc's. Aprox. 240 min of Pure Sex and the city! It is a amazing story from beggining to end."
4,sex and the city #1,I was really shocked when I received this IwAS PERFECT ALMOST NEW. i WAS VERY HAPPY WITH WASY THAT IT LOOK AND VIEW JUST LIKE NEW
2,Issue with Sex and the City - Season 1 on DVD,"My issue was that when I opened the DVD, the inner circle that actually holds the DVD in place was cracked so the discs were sliding about. If they had been scratched, I would have returend the product."
5,A MUST HAVE FOR ALL-NOT JUST FOR WOMEN!,These are wonderful shows that are very cleverly written. The actors are all great and it is not just for women! Evey man that I have shown it to loved it! GET IT!!
5,What you you say about this?,"Sex and the City needs no introduction. It's one of those few shows that's funny enough, and the episodes are short enough that you could watch it over and over again. It's nice to see the 30 minute episodes put one after another, as there were some I'd missed, or maybe even some scenes I missed. There really isn't any special extra footage or anything. Just lots and lots of Sex in the City. I do find the price to be a bit much, though."
5,A must have for any Sex in the City fan!,"I thought that I had viewed at least every episode twice, but I bought this collection just in case (and for a girls night). What a surprise to find three shows that I had never seen before. The DVD doesn't offer a lot of extra material--just the original commercials and the original HBO Behind-the-Scenes show. Great fun to watch either by yourself or with friends."
5,Great stuff - why not sending to Japan??,"I am a huge ""Sex and the City"" fan. I first ordered the second season DVD because the first season DVD was ""restricted"" for Japan shipment. I was wondering why. I couldn't get clear answer from Amazon.com, so I purchased from different internet seller. I received the product with no hustle and I find no trace of what OUR government would not approve.Anyhow, I enjoyed the first season very much although personally, I like the second season better while the dialogue and acting are so well matched and much more sophisticated.Cannot wait to have the third season."
4,Fun. Seinfeld without the males.,"Looking for some mindless fun? ""Sex"" is hard to beat. Just as ""Seinfeld"" captured the lives of four characters with no apparent sources of income, more time and friends than most people could expect, and an extended childhood lifestyle, ""Sex and the city"" offers four attractive women, little evidence of fully engaging employment, and full access to the excesses of New York. The four female leads are very attractive, each in her own partially peculiar way. Their tastes differ yet converge on men, clothes and sex, but not necessarily in that order. Are they sexy? You bet? Are they looking for husbands? It would appear so. Are they good marital prospects? I doubt it.For any woman who dreamed of living his or her post-college days in Manhattan, this -- I can only imagine -- is the fantasy on screen. Eighteen thirty-minute episodes. Watch them all an pass on the tapes to your married friends who can't follow the schedule on HBO."
4,A good way to get started,"The reason I got the first season was because I started watching the third season on HBO and I was completely hooked. All the clothes and the fashion drove me insane. So here you can see where it all began. The first episode is very rough looking Carrie does not dress the way she does now but I really recommend it if you want to see where it all began and continue all in one sitting, thats what I did. Like the say around my way ""it is truly of the hook"""
5,you just gotta love it,"Last year, I bought the first season and immediately invited a friend over to watch it. She was doubtful at first, becasue I'm always forcing my friends to watch chick stuff that they don't really like. By episode 2, we were junkies.I'm not single, in my mid-thirties, and I've never been to New York. Yet this is a show that truly transcends all that. Chronic batchelors and male egotists are described hilariously, and the war between singletons and smug-marrieds is constructed in such a way that would make the Bridget gang blush. See this and season two, and then find that friend who has HBO and make her dinner every Sunday just to keep watching."
5,Does anyone not like this show?,"I wasn't expecting it, but I didn't even pause before buying it when this gem hit the shelves. This is one of the smartest and funniest shows on television. Even better - it's affordable! It's far too typical for TV shows to come out 1 or 2 episodes to a tape, all priced at $19.95 or more. At this price, I'll buy the whole series - soon? I hope? I'm waiting for season two..."
3,Image quality is poor,"I really enjoyed this movie, although it is not aired in Japan yet. However I found one flaw in this DVD. As I watched this DVD on my 32-inch TV monitor, I noticed the image quality is so poor that I thought I was watching VHS tape recordings. I think this needs improvement."
4,One of the greatest shows on TV,"'Sex and the City' started its first season introducing us to the four gals, Carrie, Charlotte, Miranda, and Samantha. This season, Carrie meets Mr. Big, who will be her on-again, off-again love interest for seasons to come. Miranda dates Skipper for a while and Samantha dates everybody. Charlotte, the more traditional of the group, will not sleep with anyone on the first date, unless it's a certain Jewish art collecter. Hmm... It's amazing how frank the subject matter is. There isn't a sexual topic that this show has looked over. My friends and I started renting the series and having 'Sex and the City'-a-thons. This is a great series and started off really well in its first season. It only gets better..."
2,Great content but poor video quality,"Sex and the City is a great series and it is great to have the whole first season in one dvd collection. So, on content, I give it 5 stars. HOWEVER, the video quality is so poor (no stars) that I could not recommend this set unless you are a hard-core fan. The pictures are incredibly grainy and unclear. In fact, the video quality of this dvd series is so bad, it is not only worse than any dvd I own, it is worse than any vhs tape I have including some that I have recorded from TV shows."
3,The beginning.,"The first season was just ok, it had more of an unfocused feel to it. The show also had more of a grainier texture to it. The first season really doesn't deal with relationships that much, it focuses mostly on random dating, which makes it hard to get a reading on these women aside from their generic label (the sexually adventurous one, the cynic, the uptight one). Only SJ Parkers character is explored deeper, even though her character is mostly negative, self-absorbed, neurotic and prone to relationship sabotage. As for people who critize SJP looks, she isn't supposed to be a model she's supposed to be a normal woman who is comfortable with her looks, a woman normal women can relate to. Overall an ok season. EP"
3,Huh?,I don't get it -- what was all the fuss about? I plan to view the second season just to give this show the benefit of the doubt. I guess I am just getting old!
1,"Good show, horrible picture quality",While it may be a good show the picture quality on this dvd is terribal. the picture is very ruff and grainy. Watching the show on HBO from my satilite is clearer than the DVD.
3,Sex and the City,I did not like the way the discs are packaged. The cover is very weak and it does not keep the discs in the allotted holes. Overall the season itself was fine but I would prefer a sturdier cover.
1,Sex in The City? Not With THESE Folks,"Allegedly comic adventures of fluff-brained magazine writer and her ghastly friends on the search for a trophy husband in the ritzier neighborhoods of New York. The cast includes such likeable people as Sarah Jessica Parker, Kim Cattrall, and Chris Noth, but they are playing the sort of yuppie scum who should be sterilized at birth, lest they reproduce. I'm not even sure that this film could speak to real-life yuppie scum--even they have a greater capacity for love than this crew . . ."
2,Well produced soft-core porn,"We've seen this before, a bunch of guys sittin' around talkin' about how they ""scored"" last night. Each guy's diatribe leads into a scene displaying the described mattress mambo. Except it's not guys this time. That's really the only difference. Sure there is more whining and talk about ""relationships"" but its the same old hoochie-koochie in a different dress.So I say rent some porn instead. Porn is cheaper, the acting is sometimes better than in this show, it's more honest and the ""payoff"" is greater."
2,Toe Lint,I would rather collect toe lint and put it into a small purple box than ever watch another episode of Sex and the City. The ladies are pretty though. This is NOT for us... Males in their 20's. It's for lonely chicks.
1,Everything you don't want your children exposed to,"This sitcom is proof positive that we live in an anything goes society. ""Sex and the City"" could very easily be titled ""The Sodam and Gomorrah"". Too bad we allow any and everything on tv as long as it generates money for a few. We can not continue to turn our backs on God because one of these days God is going to leave us and not even say goodbye. If you like promiscuity sodomy, nudity, unsafe sex, etc, then this is the one for you. I would have rated it zero but that wasn't one of the choices."
2,Disappointed,I was disappointed I. The condition the DVD case came in. Severely cracked and damaged. I called Amazon and they refunded all my money. DVD seems to work fine. Thank God. You would think this seller would have packed it a little better than just an envelope. Broken plastic from the case was all at the bottom of the packaging. Bummer:(
5,LOVED IT,I received the DVD on time. I really enjoyed it. I just wish there were comments from the director. I enjoy hearing the background information and tidbits about the scenes and the actors.
3,Sex & the City-The Complete 1st Season,"The movie was purchased as a gift. The outer covers were falling apart and looked terrible. However, the dvd itself looked fine."
3,Real and funny at times,Hearing about this show for a long time I thought I better watch it to see what everyoe was talking about and it's actually pretty good. I cans ee why women love it and some men like it alos. I found the charactors really funny and wella cted. The stories where good but at times I wasent interested and found myself board with the topiocs the women where talking about. Overall the show is very real and that's great it's time they start to show real stuff on tv.
3,DVD Video Transfer Awful,"I have only watched the first episode so far. While I do enjoy the show, I must point out that the DVD version was done very poorly. I realize it was only a ""TV"" show, but on my HDTV the color is lousy and heavily pixelated. Perhaps the worst DVD video quality I've seen so far. You may just want to buy the VHS for this one. Don't waste time or money on this DVD."
5,They Become Your Friends,Such a great show. Most women can connect with at least one of the ladies. This show is a great and entertaining diversion from our own lives. Love it!
1,Fun show - crap quality DVD,"The quality of this transfer is really pathetic compared to what can be done on DVD. Has a bad case of what looks like overcompression or simply poor transfer. Had really high hopes for this coming from HBO, but their weekly broadcast (especially on HBOHD) puts this DVD to shame. Image is just a shade worse than standard cable, worse than sat, and well below good DVD."
1,Very Poor Packaging,The packaging for all 6 seasons is very poor. The DVD cases are tri-fold and made out of very poor quality plastic. I purchased all 6 seasons and have had trouble with the cases breaking apart at the folds. Poor quality product!
1,Three uglies and a pretty,"the title of this review should say it all. the show basically concerns over-the-hill hag (Samantha), brittle wallflower (Miranda), hatched-face (Carrie), and pretty-sweet one (Charlotte) as they date. Its no wonder the three ugly, attempting-to-sell-them-selves-to-thebest-looking-preppie ones can't find anyone who'd love them, while the pretty one manages to snag 2 husbands by the end of the show.Women try to pretend this is about feminism. Its not. Its about how being slut and going for outside appearances in men leave them, well, jilted (witness how much of a plaything Carrie turns into for Mr. Big- he's a jerk, but a handsome jerk, so she'll do anything for him).The more you watch this show, the emptier they become. sort of like the political rhetoric feminists use to defend it."
3,Happy Customer,"The efficiency of doing business with Amazon leaves nothing to be desired. The Product was satisfactory.Thank you,Lorenzo"
1,Who needs a parody when you can watch the original?,"It's called ""the world's greatest fashion show"" by people who don't want to admit that they're waiting for the actors to undress.Some say it's about human relations. No, it isn't. It's about sex.Still others have dubbed it ""feminist"". Come on, you don't really think feminist activists are watching this trash, are you?Even from a sexist angle, the show is a failure. I mean, the women in the show are ugly. Especially Carrie. Curiously, some of the men are more good-looking! Not to mention the trannies.The only positive thing one could say about ""Sex and the City"" is that with this original, you really don't need the parodies."
4,"Hilarious, provcative and seductively funny","Sex and the City, on DVD, is wonderful. The enhanced features show a lot of time and effort put into the compilation of the series' first season. My only quibble is that some of the images/shots seem grainy, but for the most part is reasonably great quality. The sound is excellent. I also wish that each episode could have chapters to them, but c'est la vie on that one. Overall, a great buy!"
1,DVD is for quality! SKIP THIS DVD,"We all buy DVD for one reason: crisp clear pictures. I own about 20 DVD movies. I have a 27 inch Sony TV with S-video. My other DVDs look WONDERFULLY CLEAR. This DVD collection from HBO is unacceptable! I cant even bear to watch it all. I love the Sex... series alot.. But , I find myself staring at the grainy picture..... I cant even stand to finish the first episode. I have old VHS that looks better than this... even recording at EP mode on a VHS looks more clear than this. One word= GRAINY. They ought to be ashamed to have released this garbage transfer. I am curious to know if the VHS of this is clear. Really, listen to us all.... SKIP THIS! you will be sorry!"
5,There should be more shows this good!,"An absolutely charming and witty show about the travails of 4 30-something New Yorker single gals, all quite different but smart, sexy, successful and with a lot of personality. The show takes a humorous and original look at the perils of relationships in the space age. These are women and men who want it all -- but are having some trouble figuring out what the 'all' is.Although the primary viewpoint is female, the show's not anti-male. Rather men are looked upon like strange, wondrous and often infuriating creatures -- much like they in turn think of women.None of this tells you how GOOD the episodes are. My wife and I watch one a night, sipping them like fine wine. All four co-stars are extremely natural and convincing in their parts, and the supporting male actors are generally excellent as well. If you like witty, thoughtful and original comedy, you need look no further."
3,"Off on the Wrong Foot, but Necessary","A fan of the actual book these were based on, I thought they did a good job of bringing the characters and sketches to life. But the series hits it's stride later when it moves Bushnell's girls into their own. Necessary for the rest of the show. But this is not the best season."
5,"Sex and The City, First Season","I really enjoyed this DVD set. I am an avid Sex and the City Watcher. I didn't start watching it until their 3rd Season, so I missed out on the beginning episodes. I like seeing the characters in the beginning. Seeing how they have changed from then to now. I bought the 2nd Season also."
2,Lackluster series,"Sex and the City is Darren Star's attempt at a raunchier, more sexually explicit Melrose Place--and he fails miserably. The most interesting character is Carrie (Sarah Jessica Parker) and that's not saying much. She gives us a look into the convoluted relationship problems of herself and her three friends. These supposed liberated women for the late '90s have nothing better to do than talk about how they can't find a man and how all men are the same. Mr. Big (Chris Noth)and his realtonship with Carrie is an interesting focus of the show, but unfortunately it's not enough. This ""sexy adult comedy"" leaves much to be desired."
4,Sarah Jessica Parker looks absolutely like a drag queen!,"She always looks like a guy to me. I mean it! I don't know how can anyone find her attractive. Is it just because she is the one who tells the story? Anyway, the other three girls are cute and lovely. This might be the best season to buy."
3,Great DVD but Quality sucks,"I really liked this DVD. It was good to see how Mr. Big first met Carrey and view all the episodes that I missed. It also has a nice text screen that allows you to read about the episode before watching, that way you can tell which episode your going to see. However, I must say that the video quality of some of the episodes (especially the first one) is very grainy and basically sucks. The colors are bland and I was very disappointed. That being said, I still think this DVD is a must have...Just dont expect much in the ""video-quality"" department."
3,Great Series-- Horrible DVD transfer,"While I agree with the other reviews that the content is superb, I could only give the set 3 stars because of its terrible transfer to DVD. The quality was so bad (for DVD) as to be distracting. This is unforgivable for a well known, well financed outfit like HBO. This isn't Goodtimes video!"
3,"Great product, cheaper at the store",I found it a few dollars cheaper at target but it is a great product
5,it gets you the basics and more,"I used this book to learn the basics of Catia V5. It does the job in a nice fashion.It covers also some more advanced topics, giving enough information to move to more complete and detailed manuals. It's a no frills book, getting you the right information and hands on exercises.I recommend it to every beginner who wants to move to an intermediate level."
1,extremely self centered,"Every song on this song is about her! I mean, give me a break! Almost every song has the word I or Me in it. Try Me out, I want Your Love, I gotta Keep Dancing-even if the song title doesn't have the personal pronoun in it, they are all about her! And her voice is just annoying! She is NOT a good performer-and she made a SECOND album? I don't believe it!"
5,This one es the bes.,I think this is one of the best dance cd's ever created and I recommend everyone that is interested in getting good dance collections without spending too much... Please go ahead and support this Italian girl. She rocks.And the world has danced to her songs since then.Enzo Barbatova.
5,Best tool I have found so far for stuck studs and bolts,"Well, title pretty much says it all, this is the best tool I have found so far for stuck studs and bolts, works if the bolt head is rounded off too, just put the correct sized tool over the bolt/stud and hammer it one, it creates little groves in the metal that the metal 'teeth' on these things use to grip and remove the bolt/stud, I haven't had it fail on me yet, although haven't had to deal with anything that was heavily corroded."
2,Not for Exhaust Studs...,"I purchased this to loosen the exhaust studs on my Harley. I followed the instructions, but all it did was turn making the studs completely stripped and worthless...A little heat and visegrips is what worked for me."
3,Good background needs more Photos,This book gives you a good background on these teams before they left town.I found out some neat stuff about the history of baseball's vagabonds but was really disappointed there weren't more photos especially of the old ballparks.Nice try but it comes up short because of that.
2,Dissapointed,"I thought that this was a great idea for a book, however it turns out to be essentially a game by game summary of each team's last season. The history of the team and reasons for the moves are covered very briefly. I wanted to read more about why the teams moved. I found myself just skimming through the game by game recaps until I got to a part that actually discussed something about the team moving. I also agree that the book needs more pictures. Each chapter contains only a team photo and a photo of the team's stadium"
4,Great Product!,"This was a great buy! It works well in the car, with a kit of course! I love jogging and riding bikes, so it's perfect!"
4,Decisive Battles of the Wesyern World Vol. 3 by JFC Fuller,"This book has been marginalized to the point of censorship because it gives a different perspective of WW2. Communists and capitalists joined forces to destroy Germany for financial, not ideological, reasons as Churchill, a main proponent of the war, admitted. Most Americans were ""educated"" by the government and Hollywood newsreels into believing that Hitler wanted to rule the world. If you want to know the truth don't depend on the self-serving histories of Winston Churchill or the fanatically biased William Shirer. In addition to Fuller, read A.P. Taylor, David Hoggan, Liddell Hart, J.V. Peale and Charles Callan Tansell. Or continue clinging to the history you've been conditioned to believe."
4,book readers,"i gave it a 4 due to the fact I really havn't had a chance to read it , but.... it's the ""bible"" story, hey you can't go wrong with the ""bible"" :-)"
1,Hideous use of paper,"I live in the same small community as the author, so I was looking forward to reading Shades of Justice. Unfortunately I came away from the experience with chills, though not the ones that I assume the author had hoped for from his readers. Inane dialogue, see through plot, ...character development are the more subtle descriptions of this book. It is hard for me to believe that a book such as this -- inept in every way imaginable -- can actually get published."
2,Not quite as expected...,"This case is similar to the others out for the Zen V, except that it fits a little looser, and the clip on the back has got to be the ugliest thing I've ever seen. I'm sorry I bought it."
2,Not a quality product,The silicon cover fits right and does protect the player well but it is made of cheap materials compared to other silicon covers I've seen. The white belt clip is really clumsy and to remove it you have to pull the player out of the skin. I'd buy a different cover if I was to make this purchase again...
2,Not a great choice,Seller way over charges at $4.95 for postage when actual postage is .77 cents! Product has cheezy akward plastic clip. Not easy to use volume function as it is completly covered up.
5,A Moving Tribute to a Brilliant Writer/Wit,"Shivers went up my spine as celebrities kissed, bowed, and/or gave heartfelt happy birthday wishes to this Dublin wit. It is easily seen that each line is read with tone and emotion of true effort, evincing all participants definitely wanted to be a part of this and were in some way affected by his genius, making the DVD even more special. Incredibly wonderful DVD."
4,Advanced Egyptian Bellydance,"I really enjoyed this video. The different rhythms are described. Hilary does give some instruction while she is dancing, although not all the moves are explained. The performance is great and the music is very good as well. The vintage dance postcard collection is awesome."
2,koverRoos Outdoor Furniture Covers,"I am very unhappy with the Tyvek covers. They leak and collect condensation. I have bought several and they have already ripped in less than 2 months. They are very expensive and not worth the money. The Koverroos iii material seems to withstand the elements better than the Tyvek. I do not recommend these unless you want to throw your money away. I have had to put a tarp under these and buy beachballs so the water will roll off. For the price, they are definitely NOT WORTH IT!"
1,What kind of phony nonsense is this?!,"Take a close look at this - no Toslink connections, just crappy old DB 25's! This is a picture of an old computer X-Y crossover switch.Amazon, You need to be way more carefull on what you let vendors post.This is the second time in 2 days I've come across phony sellers. The other is an anti-dog barking device which had 3 phony reviews posted- I found the exact same phony reviews, word for word, all across the web when searching for that same product.Stuff like this brings the good vendors down with it."
4,Wonderful score,For Whom the Bells Tolls (Paramount 1943) is one of the highlights in screen legends Gary Cooper and Ingrid Bergman filmography.....The musical score by one of the most underrated composers in the history of cinema -Victor Young- reflects perfectly the nature of the film...It is a score to listen carefully and enjoy for a lifetime....
3,"Medium-rare, not Well-done","The other reviews on this site are essentially correct. On Artillery is readable and interesting and has some good perspectives on historical developments. It is also overly focused on French and German (especially the latter) matters. Gunderson is primarily interested in exploring organization and tactics of field artillery, and displays little interest in technology, institutional analysis, and strategic planning. In particular, the lack of interest in the impact of technology upon tactics is disappointing. I find his omissions more interesting than what he included, such as that he could write upon the subject without discussing logistics beyond a cursory mention of the switch from horse to vehicle traction and in regards to technology to go without mentioning the introduction of the mechanical time fuze."
3,Black- nitendo wii skin cover for classic controller,This is a good product. Helps to keep controller from getting scratched up. It also gives the controller an appealing look.
1,Restaurant Promotion Only,"This book is more publicity for the restaurnants than a useful guide. There is very little critical analysis of the food and a lot of pretty pictures. If you want to see a photo of a restaurant or get the phone number it may be helpful, but you can find the same information at the best restaurant web site."
1,Inaccuries on every page,"Every page had historical inaccuracies. The goal of the book was to put the sins of Nazis and the CIA on Russia and Israel. Cognative dissonance on every page. A mix of historical facts with the authors agenda. Praises George Bush Sr as a noble person, need any more be said.The author has no credibility, he writes as a spokesman for the Central Intelligence Agency, which is what i view him as after reading this book"
1,Painfully overbearing,"Bland, cliche' attempt to burden Caucasians the world over with yet another heaping-helping of liberal guilt. One puts this book down with the impression that not only is Martin Lee virulently, obsessively anti-German, he is also a staunch opponent of anything even remotely resembling traditional Eurocentric culture. The West is the enemy, and fascist boogie-men, usually Germans (who are inherently evil and Fascist, no matter what generation), lurk around every corner!If your idea of objective literature is whatever the rest of the collective masses are willing to have shoved down their throats, no questions asked, this book is for you."
3,Authors Bias taints Potential For Interesting Study,"I was quite thrilled to get my copy and dig in as I had just completed Frederick Taylor's book on denazification.It didn't take long to sense a bias toward the Germans, Russians, CIA, Israel .....hell just about everybody.This then caused me to constantly go back and forth to the footnotes and all my other reference books to source and verify statements of ""fact"" made by the author.Although there were lots of great ancedotes, and historical facts they had to be painfully weeded out from the overbearing opinion of the author.What a shame he should have been more dispassionate or pursued his subject with an open mind."
2,Drivein Cult Classics?,"Drive-In Cult Classics, Vol. 4Pretty much what you would expect from ""B"" movies from the 60s made for drive-in theaters. Some are actually OK, but all are fun and nostalgic. At least now I can see the movie I missed while I was making out with my girlfriend. LOL"
4,a minor chapter of the WW2 experiences,"The Mennonites were a group of ethnic Germans, who had been living in the Soviet Union for decades, prior to World War 2. Distinguished by their religious beliefs, as a minor Christian church. Epp explains their experiences during and after the war. Focusing on the women. Some welcomed the German army as liberators, and indeed, some could only be described as willing collaborators with the Nazis.The Mennonite experiences here are an often overlooked part of the war. With the ambiguities of collaboration, and then having to flee a resurgent Soviet army. The later part of the book goes into the resettlement of the refugees, mostly in Canada. Often with the problems of the women being separated from spouses, or perhaps being widowed, or simply not knowing if a husband was still alive."
3,SLIGHT PROBLEM WITH DESIGN.,This doesn't work under the counter. The sensor to open goes off and keeps opening. So now I'm just using it as normal garbage can. I
1,Packaging,"Unbelievable that I ordered this product in December, so the company might think......Christmas gift? It arrived yesterday in its box with the product displayed all over it for the neighborhood to see along with my fiance (whom requested an electronic garbage can for Christmas). Luckily I caught the UPS driver before she could actually see it but if it were there earlier as I expected there would have been one gift ruined for a suprise. These companies should think about this especially during the Christmas holiday. Thanks for almost screwing up a gift."
5,NST Nine Stars DZT-24-1 Infrared Touchless Automatic Trash Can - 6.3 Gal,"Bought this garbage can for my RV. Love it ! Although I had to set it back a bit from where I stand doing dishes, because it kept opening and closing as I moved. Creates a conversation piece with guests. Great little unit - the 6.3 Gallon is a perfect size for my RV.[...]"
4,Nice Product ... Battery latches are flimsy.,"After about a year the plate that holds the batteries in place would wiggle loose every week or two and the batteries and cover would end up in the garbage. After the batteries and cover inadvertently were tossed out with the garbage, I replaced the unit. Now I keep the battery compartment secured with duct tape, except for periodic battery changing."
2,Lid sensor malfunctions,"I have had this for approx 7 months now, and the lid sensor stopped working a few months ago. It does open and close, but that is the problem. It won't STOP opening and closing. Open, close, open, close, it will do it a hundred times in a row unless I turn it off. Even if the room is dark and there is nobody near it, it just keeps opening and closing. I've had it turned off for months. Luckily I can open it and it remains open if I want it to.I am finally contacting customer service today. The 1-year warranty SHOULD cover this according to their website. You have to have proof of purchase and it has to be under 1 year old. Customer has to pay return shipping though, which stinks. We'll see what happens."
3,Has Its Moments,"I got the garbage can for Christmas and its ok. Overall, it does its job so far but it has some things that drive me crazy. If you get too close to it, it will open on its own even if you dont swing over the sensor. Another thing that irks me is taking the garbage out because the plastic piece that make this garbage bag bag-less is a pain in the butt to take out. Would I get it again? probably not."
2,"When worked, it was great. But Lid is open even after Push CLOSE!","When it worked, it was great! But after just less than 2 months of usage, I got similar problem as the other customer. It stays open, even after I pushed the close button, and it will reopen again!"
4,VERY GOOD FOR THE PRICE,THE PRODUCT WAS SHIPPED VERY QUICKLY AND WELL PACKED.IN ITS PRICE RANGE IT WOULD BE HARD TO BEAT AND I AM HOPPING THAT WITH THE SENSOR LID IT WILL OUTLIVE MY PREVIOUS TWO TRASH CANS FROM COSTCO IN TEN YEARS.
4,Good performance after the first day! Watch out with the small component inside!,"Hi,After one terrible day where the trash can open and close without any sense, and been disconected for 2 days, it started working perfectly and me and my girlfriend we are happy with the item.Watch out with the small plastic ring holding the trash bag...you have to introduce inside the bags and you might forget inside when you throw you trash away resulting in a big problem, because those rings can't be bought easily.2 weeks so far and we happy with the purchase and price."
5,Great purchase!,"We ordered this garbage can a year ago, it works great and i love it. Have never had any problems."
2,Loved it...Now replacing it,"Loved it when I got it. It worked great for about 5 months. Then is kind of worked when it wants to. Now, when it actually does open (and that's only after I push the button - so much for touchless) it simply stays open (until I push the CLOSE button)!"
1,I hate it!,"The bag ring to hide the bag its holding in broke right away. The sensor is not reliable at all. The stainless gets smeared fast and since its a trash can, has lost its ""luster"" from being washed often. The control panel on the front of the lid looks awful after having to use it and then wipe it often due to unreliability of the sensing system. I would not purchase this again. Id prefer to have the foot pedal."
2,Perhaps what you pay is what you get,"The trash can came in quickly, Amazon sent it out in no time. However, the trash can will some times work and some times it seems as if its logic is stuck between opening and closing when the motion sensor is kicked off. I have to turn off the device and then turn it back on."
5,it is perfect,This is the second one we have purchased. the fist one lasted us about 4 years. We love the automatic lid and it sure helps in not transferring the germs by not touching the lid.
3,Looks identical to the iTouchless but it doesn't work as well,"It stops sensing temporarily. Verified it wasn't the batteries. It just wont sense and open the lid, neither will it respond to the buttons. This lasts for a short period of time and then it goes back to being normal. It's not bothersome enough for me to pack it up and return it though."
2,bulky and not smart,I have this bin for over one year. it's broken now. but this is not a point - my main grudge is that top is heavy and unstable. I have seen much more elegant solution for automatic can opener. pay more money and get better quality.
1,GARBAGE,"I received this product as a gift. I was thrilled it was exactly what I wanted and it worked perfectly for a few months. But then it stopped working. I followed all of the troubleshooting tips on the company's website with no results, so I began my attempt to contact them for a warranty replacement. No dice. You contact Nine Stars Products who tell you it's not their problem you need to contact Nine Stars Group USA, and the latter company is completely unreachable. Bottom line: if you buy this product it will work for a short time and then stop working and you will need to buy a replacement - the company will not honor any warranty they advertise."
3,batteries,"If it did not need batteries it would be great,If only they would invent one that maybe could be opened by a pedal you operate by stepping on it with your foot. Less likely to break, less expensive, no batteries to replace and better for the environment. Oh, wait, it's already been invented so I don't see the point of having a motion sensor."
3,Great for 6 months...,"Got this as a birthdhay gift from my parents who boughht one for thhemselves too. theirs lasted 5-6 months ours maybe 1 year at most. After that it would never open when you wanted it to, but then would on its own and not close. We would have to use the buton to open and sometimes wouldnt even work. Then it broke alltogether - doesnt open at all. We were going to look for replacement lid, but probably not worth the money. Pplus the ring always gets thrown away by accident!"
3,Great when it works,"This is my third purchase of the same product in 3 years. The price is half of the first one I purchased in 2007. The mechanism is delicate and subject to failure- I THINK from exposure to water or spray cleaners. But .. It is a perfect fit in the space I have and my 3 year old grandson thinks it is the greatest, so I am giving it one more try."
2,"Good for a few years, but then quit","If 3 years is good, then spend the $$$. Our model stopped opening in the 3rd year. Now, the only ""hands free"" way is to hold the lid open for 15 seconds so that it will stay open all the time."
2,"Great at first, now motor too weak to open lid","I really love the idea of this trash can, and loved how it worked for the first 6 months or so. The first thing to go wrong was that the batteries kept falling out and into the trash. The battery compartment door broke. We taped it up, but that means it's a hassle to change batteries. Then, the lid started opening slower and not opening completely, like it lost it's zeal for life. Whether the lid motor is depressed or defective, I'm unwilling to pay $50 for a replacement lid. So, it's almost a year old, and has only worked as expected for roughly half that time. I think my next trash can will be a traditional step-open."
5,Great Buy,"I am surprised to hear that so many people have had problems. I have had mine for at least 4 years and only one issue - the inside ring has split but we glued it and it is fine. I really think that was our fault - the bag was too heavy and we pulled on it to get it out and the ring got stuck. As far as the lid not opening - if you press the open or close button instead of just waving your hand accross it will not work (motion) until you turn it off and back on and it ""re-sets"" it. I learned that after I had company that pressed the button because they did not know it was a motion sensor. I have only replaced my batteries twice in 4 years. I was on here looking at them for a friend that loved mine when she came to visit me. They are much cheaper now, I paid almost $100 when I got mine."
5,wonderful product,"This is our second purchase of the NST Nine Stars DZT -42-1 Infrared Touchless Automatic Motion Sensor Lid Open Trash Can, 11.1 Gallon. Our first can lasted us 4 years; plus my very capable husband was able to fix the broken part, so it has been resurected and will have continued use. So, based on the above statement, we obviously like these cans and will continue to use them. We do not have a location in our kitchen to store our trash out of sight. This serves us very well as it meets all our requirements: A cover on our trash container, nice looking and convenient. I would also like to point out that Amazon had the best price and free shipping for this product. For us, there really are no negatives."
2,Worked for 4 months.. and then...,"Bought this from amazon a few months back and really worked well for about 3 months, then the lid started acting funny. It opens sometimes and other times just opens a bit and shuts down. It got very annoying.If you have a choice, buy something like this from Costtco, when it breaks atleast you can send it right back to the manufacturer."
1,Need to send it back...,The motion sensor lid only worked for about a day. We had one like this before that worked great until my son dropped the lid on the garage floor. We'll probably try an exchange.
3,GOOD BUT SOMEWHAT SIMPLE,"I just would like to point out that this book's intended audience is really only 7 to 10 years old at the most. Any kid older than that might find the book too simple. The main characters, however, are 12 and 14.All I am saying is that the kids are smarter than we sometimes give them credit for.Otherwise, it's a very decent book, with a good, positive message. I liked the puzzles the heroes have to solve - they are a nice addition to an adventure side of the story."
3,Read like a 1st grade lecture.,"The book description sounded interesting, but I didn't realize it was for VERY early readers. I have occasionally enjoyed young adult books purchased by accident, so now I believe YA and adult are in my suggested readings from Amazon. This is geared more for early elementary students, not young adults even. That being said, I have no problems with the premise. I will not be purchasing the other books in this series."
4,Good Science Fiction for Grammar Age,"We needed a science fiction book for a 5th grade project. This one fit the bill. I think both boys and girls would enjoy it. My son hasn't finished it yet, but seems to like it."
2,Not for adults,I expected a lot more of this book based on the reviews. Unfortunately this book did not do it for me. It is a book for young adults/ teenagers at best.
2,This Book/Story Reads Like a Childrens Story.,"I have just finished reading ""Wired"" by the same author which was a great read but this was either written by someone else or deliberately written for children. (The author has written for children according to his profile"
2,did not finish it,I kept waiting for it to get better-oh well it was just a shot- its hit or miss with books
1,Elementary School Level Writing,This might be a good kids book. It is written in a rudimentary and lecturing style which is terribly irritating.
5,Great Fun -- Highly Recommended!,"As a former elementary and middle school teacher, I heard about this book and thought I would check it out. It is very easy to read, and once you start you can't stop. Although totally different than Harry Potter, it is similar in that adults will enjoy it as much as kids. The plot is very clever and there are a lot of fun twists and turns along the way. I also agree with the review by the Grandmother who wrote about the high quality of the book itself. It is a beautifully done edition that really stands out. Parents who get this book for their children will not be disappointed."
3,didn't know it was for kids,I would not have bought it had I known it was aimed at teenagers. I find this review process an invasion of my time and privacy however I am trying this once.
3,prometheus,a different style of novel full of quirks and mysteries.i would rate it a bit above three and worth a read.
4,fast read,"This was a good book, it took me a few hours to read. I think kids and adults alike would enjoy this book."
3,Promethius Project trapped,"Promethius project Trapped. more for a teenage read, although very interesting. not my cup of tea. will reread later on"
3,So much untapped potential,This story started good and then just sort of faded away by the end of it I had no desire to read the next two which will probably take up unread space on my kindle from now until it gets recycled.
2,Book for children,"May be it is my mistake, but this is children book and I bought it thinking that it is a sci-fi one. Even as a children book I can rate it high, because there are books and authors like Jules Verne that are an universe apart of Prometheus Project."
2,Check carefully which version you're buying,"Not all the reviews on this page are for the same version of Keaton's The General. The Allied Artists Entertainment edition has no soundtrack whatsoever, even though the back cover of the product features the 'Dolby Stereo' trademark. Silent films were not silent in theaters; musical accompaniment with a score carefully designed to match was an integral part of the presentation. We returned our AAE purchase and got the Kino edition instead."
2,Disappointed,"I was so disappointed! My husband and I had watched ""The General"" on TV a week before and loved it, and so I decided to order it. When it came, it didn't have the wonderful, expressive organ music we heard in the version on TV. I assumed that was what it would be. The orchestra music with it is heavy and totally unrelated to what's happening in the film. All the reviews I have read since receiving this DVD are the same for every DVD Amazon offers; some say there are choices to have organ music, but which ones are they??? Certainly not this one. I guess I can turn the sound off, but I really would like to find one with the organ background."
3,Entertainment from 1927?,"While Chaplin was in a league of his own, Buster Keaton is impressive in his own inimitable way. The only other actor I seemed to like in the same genre and from the same era was Norman Lewis. Though Charlie is a legend you cannot afford to ignore this one from Buster Keaton. Like me if you like trains you'll love this one. Made in the silent era it is funny, exciting, with plenty of good action and adventure, and with a touch of romance. The only painful thing was the repetitive music tunes unlike the better compositions of Charlie Chaplin's films. 3.5 stars."
4,Amazing But Marred,"This movie made by Buster Keaton is an amazing epic that assuredly has a special place in Hollywood film-making. The only thing about it that actually saddens me is that - like other films I have seen - it treats the North as the ""enemy,"" & the finale shows a Union officer surrendering to a Confederate. The Confederates did win individual victories, but was there any war more pathethic than this war? And for a film to take the view that the Confederacy was somehow ""righteous"" in its cause & the North was an ""enemy"" & shown defeated is idiocy like unto much of the Hollywood view on politics we see today. I love & respect Buster Keaton & admire the technical aspects of this film (4 stars!) - but a definite ""thumbs down"" on its view concerning the Civil War!"
2,A Classic nonetheless,"Terribly overrated, but a classic of some sort nonetheless. One would expect a fairer amount of comedy and slapstick from a Buster Keaton movie, but this is really a melodrama of the mildly outdated kind. Only one sequence delivers the goods: Keaton trying to aim a big cannon on the train he's chasing."
5,Excellent silent movie,"This is one of the greatest movies ever made. Although it has no sound, except for background music, it holds the attention of everyone, from little kids to Grandmas. Full of action, comedy, and history. And at the time it was made, there were no stuntmen, no trick photography. Everything you see is real. The presentation runs smoothly. The original black and white adds to its charm."
5,The Keaton Classic.,"The debate concerning who was the better comedian; Keaton or Chaplin, will always go on. However, I would say Keaton was because Keaton was the better overall actor of the two. Chaplin was funny because he tried to be funny, but Keaton was funny because he never really looked like he was trying to be funny. No where is this more apparent than in THE GENERAL. It is one of, if not the, best Keaton movies ever made. Not much needs to be said about the plot because that's talked to death elsewhere. However, it should be noted that even today film makers borrow scenes from this movie and it has one of the best train chase sequences in movie history. This is a great movie for any Keaton or silent movie fan to own and is a good way to introduce newcomers to good silent pictures."
1,Avoid this General,"There are other versions of ""The General"" available on DVD and any would be preferable to this one. It's picture quality is muddy and the score is simply a washover of everything from ""Pomp and Circumstance"" to Borodin to Bizet, none of it selected with the slightest appropriateness to what is going on on the screen. True, you can watch it without the sound, but why? Even at this low price, to be avoided."
3,The 2 shorts are missing!,"The General is a great film, of course, and highly recommended.But if what you are interested in is the 2 advertised shorts, you should know that they don't exist on this DVD.The description says ""Contains [...The General...] as well as two Keaton shorts: The Playhouse (1921, B&W, 23 min., Mono) and Cops (1922, B&W, 18 min., Mono)"". The DVD jacket also features them, but they ARE NOT on the DVD itself, which has ""only"" The General and it's chapter selection menu."
3,"Buster Keaton's ""The General!""","This 1926 comedy classic, directed by Buster Keaton, has some very funny moments throughout. However, I was turned off by the film because of the choice of music for this DVD release. Seeing Keaton's character pushing items out of the back of a train to distract the Yankees chasing them set to ""The Blue Danube?"" ""Pomp and Circumstance"" at the beginning makes you feel like your going to watch a graduation comedy instead of a comedy set during the Civil War. I'm told that other DVD releases have different music to accompany the film. I highly recommend checking those versions out, instead of this DVD.Movie Grade/DVD Grade: C-"
2,"Good movie, bad music","Funny movie with great facial expressions. The orchestral music ruined the mood in numerous ocasions. There is a version of this movie with piano music that is much better, get that one instead."
3,I should have listened to the reviews,"While the product itself has nothing to do with the review, the packaging does. I sent this to my daughter as a gift and when it arrived the bag was ripped and the seeds were everywhere, leaking out of the box. A total waste of money. I asked if she could salvage any and she said she will try."
2,Heyer mystery,Standard Georgette Heyer mystery. Not as entertaining as some of the latermysteries and not nearly as good as the regency novels.
3,Why Shoot a Butler,"Structured on the old Sherlock Holmes format, this is an easy read except for some of the British nouns that I did not recognize. Her repeated use of ""ejaculated"" instead of ""shouted"" was designed to renew my attention and remind me that this was a British novel. The romance element was not plausible and neither of them was loveable."
3,My Least Favorite Heyer to Date,"I can usually depend on Heyer for a good read that makes me forget everything while I travel back in time, a fun and perfect romp, but this one felt to me like it needed one more draft; it wasn't quite tight and solid, and I found myself almost irritated at times while reading. If this is your first shot at Heyer, try a different book of hers first."
2,Old Mystery Just Doesn't Hold Up,"This is a re-visit after 30 years to a novel written about 70 years ago. The overly-complicated plotting, the paper-doll characters, and the staging of the eompletely undecipherable ending just make this a mess. Thank goodness Heyer's later mysteries improved greatly and are witty, puzzling, and great fun for those who enjoy cozy, country-house type whodunnits."
3,State Fair the movie and remakes were much better,"Here is one example of where I felt that the movie(s), that were based on this book, were better than the book itself. I loved the Pat Boone remake but wished that it contained more of the fair goings on. I had hoped that the book would contain more on that, but sadly it did not. The family does not even get to the fair until almost halfway into the book. I found the author's writting style tedious, and I also did not appreciate the ""low"" morals displayed by the (post) teens, as depicted in this book. It was obviously written from the male point of view."
5,good value,gave this to my grandson for his birthday (13). He loved it. Kept opening the box and looking closely and playing with all the various tools. good value
1,Anti-Rasta christian propoganda,"I thought this would be a study in the overstanding of Selassie as Christ returned in His Kingly character. (The Messiah was prohesied as both a sacrificial lamb and and a righteous king, Iasu was the sacrificial lamb and Selassie the conquering lion).Instead I was subjected to an underhanded subversion of Rasta theology. The book appears at first to be sympathetic to Rastafari but seeks in a round-about way to discredit InI. Check ""Rastafarian Mysticism: An Introduction to the Mysteries of Nyahbinghi"" for a more Rasta presentaion of Rasta theology."
2,It is not what I expected,"I was very disappointed with the Knowledge of Water. There are too many unnecessary characters, too many story lines that do not seem to come together at the end. Even main characters were not well developed. The story is too factual. Do read the Vanished Child! It is wonderful! Don't bother with the Knowledge of Water."
3,Not as Good as the First,"After reading The Vanished Child, I just had to get my hands on The Knowledge of Water. I eagerly awaited its arrival after ordering it on Amazon... and I was disapointed.This one is slow, and needlessly melancholy. I know it is exploring themes of repression and martyrdom, but the main characters really could have lightened up a little. In the first book, there is a good reason behind their attitudes, but here they seem forced. There are numerous subplots which unfold slowly and the main plot point is a little dull.Don't get me wrong. This is an alright novel, but Smith ought to have stopped at the first and let us imagine the rest, because this does not stack up well. I don't think I'll read the third one."
2,This book should NOT have been written.,"The Vanished Child was beautiful, engrossing, and extremely well written. It is definitely one of my favorite books. The Knowledge of Water however, is neither interesting nor well-written. It is a mess of words with very little plot to hold it all together. I don't understand why Ms. Smith didn't simply leave The Vanished Child alone instead of trying to write a nearly incoherent sequel. Ms. Smith not only completely disappointed me with this book but also managed to lower my opinion of The Vanished Child in the process. If Susan Smith writes anything else I will read it. But I don't recommend this book to anyone. DO read The Vanished Child however--it was magnificent."
4,Excellent Leather Conditioner,"I used to buy a conditioning lotion back in the early 90's under the brand name ""Justin"".It was really good stuff -- it made my boots supple and shiny.At some point (can't remember exactly when) I couldn't get it anymore. I went to severaldifferent stores with no luck. I tried other conditioners, and wasn't completely satisfied.The Justin conditioner was the best -- not too thick and no too thin. It worked into theleather better than anything else I tried.Well Lo and Behold!! This conditioner IS the Justin product ... just under another name!!In my experience, its the best leather conditioner on the market.Get some today!!"
4,My Life In The South,"A very interesting book written by a slave as a boy and young man. It gives a historical perspective on their lives, hardships, family live and their dreams of emancipation as. I found it shocking at times but worth the read."
4,A Different Perspective,"This book provides an insight into this time in our history from one who experienced it. About mid-way through the book, I felt it was becoming repetitive but was able to be drawn back when I considered it was written as a Lenten reflection or teaching."
1,This Movie is Terminally BAD!,"Boring, slow, Dull, one of the WORSE movies I have ever viewed. Save Yourself some precious time and watch a good movie, i wish i did. how the heck could a studio allow such rubbish to be released. it makes you wonder."
3,"good product, but unable to use.","I have used the DONA tablets, and found them helpful. Recommended them to patients. Thought I would try the packets, but unfortunately have aspartame in them, something I did not find in the description. As I do not tolerate aspartame, I gave them to people who do."
3,Hurt knee,"I have a friend that injured her knee and her GP recommended she use it. She swears her recovery is due to it. I injured my knee about 6 weeks ago and purchased this to help with my recovery. I really haven't noticed it speeding my recovery, or making my knee feel any better. Rehab and anti-inflammatories seemed to have helped more."
4,Nice case and feel,"Great case, but it crinkled the corner of the screen protector when I slid the iPod into the case."
3,Hoopla Schmoopla,"I saw morningwood open for Kasabian who in turn opened for the Music, and I'll say that it wasnt too Yeah Yeah Yeah'ish. The show was fun, cause that lady is crazy, but I wouldn't ever have thought they would get to what kind of semi-stardom they have now. Fun band, not to much to write home about."
3,Good But Thin,"First, I'd say overall this is a good album. The songs are catchy and solid, but for some reason that I can't quite put my finger on, it's lacking something. I like the fun oversexed lyrics and themes. I like her voice, at times reminding me of Veruca Salt meets Le Tigre. Guitar riffs and tones are good. ... Check it out, but don't expect it to blow your mind or be an album you'll be savoring for years to come."
3,Good enough to wake-up with.,"This is a band that I would simply call fun. It's a little bit pop, a little bit punk, and a little bit sleaze. I've heard them compared to The Pixies, but I have no idea what those people are talking about. Closer comparisons would be Divinyls, Elastica, but mostly Yeah Yeah Yeahs to my ears. They have that kind of energy and sound anyway. I suspect a future album of theirs might be better, but this debut will still make all the blood rush to the right places. I saw them recently, and the crowd was bouncing around just as much as the singers boobs were. She fronted the band really well, and fun was had by all."
4,Morningwood DOES rock!,"One of the best bands to come on the scene this year. I've been waiting on the album release for what seems like forever. It totally rocks and will no doubt end up in my top 10 for the year. But, the censored ""Jetsetter"" track totally kills the listening experience of that song. Hence the 4 stars instead of the 5 it could have received."
3,Garbage,"Not trash, Garbage the band. But darn, if you'd have played this for me without a label I might have thought it was a new Garbage album with the lead singer mic'd a little funny. But hey, that's not bad, the songs are good, the guitars are properly thick and the girl can belt it out. But it's all the same old thing I'm afraid, so much a copy of other chick lead singer bands that have come this direction that I'm not sure I see the point, even if I like it. There's some talent here, maybe it will end up showing."
1,Beware - Censored,"I just bought this album and was really digging it, but right in the middle of the cool song ""Jetsetter"", for some reason they censor the F-word with a horrible, irritating beep. I bought the CD at a normal record store, not Wal-Mart, and this is the only version I think is available. I just found an uncensored version of the song online, but why is this version edited? Unexcuseable."
2,"sherri , reader with back and neck pain","I got this book as a gift and i think after reading it"" only if it was that easy to forget about your pain!"" I think the book tells us the strong link between the mind and pain but doesn't offer anything new when it comes to solving the problem of pain through exercises which 99% of todays experts say is the best solution to back or neck pain. Invest in an updated book that tells you how to exercise anywhere."
5,It works!,"Great investment for those with back pain. Just from bits and pieces of what I have read and practiced so far, I've been able to recover from a recent back injury in a very short period of time and will hopefully lead to a pain-free back for life."
5,Big help with back pain,"After a bad experience with a chiropractor which left me so light headed I couldn't stand up, I decided to give this book a go instead. Within a week I saw a big difference in my ability to move. My pain has been more upper back/neck pain, leading to issues with sight and lightheadedness, and while the book is based more on lower back pain the stretching routine has become part of my daily routine and helps so much. I highly recommend this book and only wish I had heard about it before going to the chiropractor and having so much damage done. I think it could have solved the shoulder pain I started with and saved so much time, money and angst of what I ended up with instead."
5,Helpful and inspiring,"I've suffered with painful muscle spasms for over 2 years. This is by far the most helpful book I've read. By following the excercises and stretches in this book, and by embracing the mind-body relationship to learn to deal head-on with chronic back pain, I have decreased my back pain in just 6 short weeks. Dr. Brownstein writes in a conversational and sympathetic way, having suffered chronic back problems himself. Don't give up on your pain until you read this book!"
4,Bet Series,"Long bow hunters is a fun read, you get a bit of everything ( cation, hunting, great scenes, a second archer!). A must for Green Arrow fans."
4,A good begining,The story is recomend for any one who wants to learn more about where Green Arrow begain. You can not read Quiver with out this book.
3,Dark but convoluted GA tale!!,"This classic Green Arrow book by Mike Grell is really dark. Much darker than I expected especially considering its a DC superhero book and from the '80s. That being said I thought it was pretty good. The story was a little too convoluted and was all over the place. The art, also by Mike Grell mostly was phenomenal. I was blown always at how detailed and modern the art looks. Overall, this book isn't going to be for everyone but its a decent read."
2,Run of the mill . . .,"The story here is soo tired. One of the industry's many failed attempts to be gritty and dark and postmodern on the heels of the resounding sucsesses of ""The Dark Knight Returns"" and ""Watchmen"". Mike Grell does a lot better with old-school fantasy stories. This book is just standard formulaic old superhero-favorite-wrestles-with-inner-demons while managing to overcome old-age, defeat the bad-guy, and save the city. Nothing original, clever, or exciting about it. The art is interesting, but ultimately it doesn't do much for me - it's too sketchy and stiff and the colors are awfull (which i suppose isn't Grell's fault). Neal Adams did a lot better with this character."
3,A provocative perspective on why we build skyscrapers,"According to van Leeuwen, it's a myth that the skyscraper was a response to high land values. Instead, he argues that they are essentially the cathedrals of our era - monuments to individual men, or to organizations, or simply monuments to civilization itself. The prose is turgid and constitutes a test of the reader's powers of concentration, but this is balanced by the numerous b&w drawings of building exteriors, averaging more than one per page. The renderings of artist Hugh Ferriss receive particular attention."
4,Faith for high school and college students,This would be good for those who are this age or woring with kids of this age. I did however find it too much filler.
2,an expensive cd player isn't supposed to break,"I purchased this CD player a little more than a year ago hoping that i would never have to buy another. The metal encasement seemed to be both durable and sturdy....in other words I didn't expect it to break. About a week ago I was walking around listening to my music and all of a sudden the music stops. I open the CD player to find that the little thing used to hold the CD onto the player broke off rendering it unable to hold a CD. You would think that the last thing to break would be that. The warrenty was only a year so i called tech support hoping that they would be able to send me a new one; boy was I wrong, they ended up transfering me to a local area repair shop who wanted to charge me a rediculous 100 bucks to fix the simple part. Now I am stuck with a working CD player unable to hold a CD."
2,A different view,I like Simple Minds and I usually perfer live music over stale studio albums.This is one of the worst concert albums I have ever heard. The songs are all muddled and the music is indistinguishable. The group never sounds in sync. I think this is one case of a group that is much better in the studio than live.
5,Once in the Life,"During a brief jail stay, two half-brothers, who have rarely seen each other while growing up, connect. One of them, called 20/20 Mike because he can sense people nearby, concocts a scheme in which the two of them will steal some dope from young couriers. The heist goes awry when Billy, the junkie brother, shoots the victims of the theft. The brothers hole up in an abandoned building, and 20/20 Mike seeks help from an old cell mate, Tony, whom he thinks is out of the life. It turns out that they have stolen Tony's dope, and Tony's boss wants the two thieves dead. Perfect dialogue without the typical clichés. This movie relied on the actor's talent and it was pulled off. Laurence Fishburne was superb at playing a career petty criminal. Titus Welliver is fabulous as Fishburne's junky half-brother. I think the best acting in this movie came from Gregory Hines and Michael Paul Chan, they paired perfectly as two of Calderon's henchmen. Great crime drama with very good acting."
1,Better To See On Cable,Not worth the money to but or rent. Laurence Fishburne an impeccable actor but crappy movie. This is why it was returned
2,Not so Hot!,"Perhaps that's why there were only 2 reviews until I decided to write this one. I suggest that Laurence Fishburne keep his day job. You may grow weary of listening to ""Fish"" trying to effect a hispanic accent. The story seems weak although Fishburne's acting is not. There are 3 things you may notice in this film. You might notice Tiger Chen who was cast in The Matrix Reloaded and was the last person to be killed by Neo in the Merovingian's mansion. Then if your memory is good enough you may remember a piece of poetry recited here that Fishburne also used in Deep Cover. Then if your memory is really, really good you might recognize Titus Welliver as Torch, who played a gun toting motorcycle club member in Biker Boyz. Other than those items I'm afraid this film is not very interesting. You've been warned!"
2,A So-So Read,"After reading Amazon.com readers' reviews for ""Best Actress,"" I bought it as it sounded like a fun read. Murder, movies, divas, Oscars...rich fodder for Hollywood Hilarity, right? Wrong...or, at least, not in this fluffy novel. It's not bad; it's merely so-so, mildly amusing. I do not recommend it."
3,Doesn't Live Up To Its Potential,"The cover and synopsis of this book made me think I was in for one giant treat! I expected the story to give me the seedy, albeit humorous, side of Hollywood. (Is there another side?) However, early on I realized that while this was an entertaining read, there wasn't much substance to it. The story was a bit trite and artificially put together. I enjoyed the characters and definitely found myself laughing at times, but overall, I didn't buy it."
2,The book was as trashy as Tinseltown itself,"When I bought this book, I was expecting big fun and seedy but sohisticated humor. I recieved neither. It was a trashy account filled with sex in almost every chapter (I felt like I was reading Penthouse's stars edition) No real substance or care for the characters, which is important. I really dont recomend it, your better off watching E! and renting a porno."
4,Here's that break you've been waiting for,I've been forcing myself to read some classics and needed a break. The size betrays the fact that it's your typical beach-read but I spent most of the time trying to match up the characters with the folks I used to read about in People (referred to as PERSONALITY here). Now I want someone to write the expose on how true this book is!
5,"Sex, Murder, Shoplifting..Best Actress is laugh out loud fun",Five actesses and one Oscar. This lighthearted romp through the lives of five nominees is a real page turner. I couldn't put it down. These five womem make the fued between Bette Davis and Joan Crawford look like a Sesame Street playgroud fight. Highly recommended.
5,organized...,"Arrived in a timely manner, easily put together and enough shelves.....really looks nice in our room...a neat and clean look,,,,in fact had to purchase another one....puts DVD and VHS movies up and able to catalog them with ease....."
1,not as pictured,"This item, as pictured here, is not the Atlantic 38435065, but a cheaper, less stable version that Atlantic has started producing instead of the 38435065. The item pictured is actually the Atlantic 38435623. The Atlantic Oskar 38435623 has shorter shelf depths than the previous version. The lesser depth causes DVD's to stick out over the edge about an inch. This causes DVD's to fall off with the slightest bump or simply brushing by them. The shelves are also thinner than the previous model, and with a little time, they bow down in the center from the weight of the DVDs on them. This has caused shelves to actually detach from off the end pegs and crash into shelves below, thereby spilling all the DVDs on the floor. Unfortunately, the 38435065 is no longer being produced, as of 2010, by Atlantic- They have instead, decided to go with this cheaper, lighter weight product, that completely sucks."
5,CD cabinet,"For the money, it is just fine. With the Amazon free shipping, it is definitely worth it. It needed a bit of tweaking in the assembly process, for example, the screws on the bottom were not countersunk and if we did not change this, the floors would have been badly scratched. It was good enough that I went back and bought a second."
4,Great choice for a growing collection,"Clear instructions & easy set-up. I bought this product just to store DVDs so the shelves dont all line up to hold 'just' DVDs since they are adjustable, but it's nice to be able to put decorative things on the shelfs as well. Durable & looks nice =)"
1,Trust me,"Trust me. This product is the original source of the term 'Chinese junk'. I own about 5,000 CDs collected since the day they began to replace vinyl. I have been through about 30 CD racks of various configurations. Some have been excellent, some horrid. The Oskar 756 CD/DVD Maple Cabinet claims the dubious honor as the worst piece of s*** to ever be sent though the mail by Amazon. If you're reading this review Amazon folks, take this thing off your roster of goods immediately. Customers be aware. I have had more experience with media storage than the cross-eyed people who gave this abomination a high rating. I threw mine in the trash three hours after it arrived at my door. It wasn't even worth my time returning. I only wish I had handed the $88 I paid for this flimsy piece of crap to a homeless person."
1,JUNK JUNK JUNK JUNK JUNK,This shelf is total JUNK! JUNKY JUNKY JUNK. JUNKY JUNKY JUNKY JUNK! Flimsy no good JUNK. A huge waste of time and money. The worst thing about it is its Junkiness.
3,You get what you pay for...,I got what I expected - a cheap DVD case. It was easy to assemble and is a little flimsy when fully loaded. Use of the anchor brackets to fix to a wall is recommended as its base is not really sufficiently large to prevent toppling should a child try to rock the case.
1,Oh Boy! Will Water Spot your vehicle!,"Water spots everywhere! I totally agree with others who have used this product. Oodles of long lasting suds ... yes ... but ... Oodles of work removing water spots! I read reviews before I started and figured I'd eliminate the spotting issue by immediately rinsing and wiping off sections as I progressed. You almost can't get the water off quick enough before spots on finish appear. Also, they are almost etched into the finish. There must be an ingredient in this wash soap that causes this since I have never had a problem like this with other wash soaps. I will certainly not use it again and delegate the remainder of the bottle to the dump."
2,"I had hard water spots, too","I used it today on my new Fit and was not pleased. Nice suds, but I feel like it left a weird film/water spots all over the car. I ended up washing it again with something else (Armorall wash and wax stuff) and was much happier."
1,spots spots hard spots!,"Nice scent, lots of suds! But try to get them off later!I washed truck in shade and rinsed every 3 feet-over & over. Apparently the key is to dry as soon as you wash a small area.I have to wax 3 times now to get ""fun bubbles"" off, and need to use special glass wax on windows because streaks are so bad!I love Meguiar's Cleaner-Wax.Have used it for years! But even that won't clear away the soap streaks!Today I had to polish with Meguires, then with Simoniz Super Blue, then Mequiars again--and I still have spots!I'm 57 yrs old & have detailed many a car/truck!I'm going to pour this product on the weeds in my driveway now!I'll never use it on my truck again!I'm looking at two more days of triple waxing just to remove the streaks!"
2,A Big Technicolor Letdown - No Restoration,"I was expecting rich, vibrant Fox Technicolor, on a par with ""Drums Along the Mohawk"", and I could have dealt with some flicker and with modest print damage, but right from the opening scene, it was clear that this film had not been restored, that the Technicolor strips were damaged, and that the colors were off (and almost non-existent at times). As a result, I found it difficult to concentrate on the film; I kept thinking of how bad it looked and how much better it might have looked had the money been put into some sort of restoration. I've grown to have so much confidence in these Fox classics, and this is my first major letdown, so I'm hoping ""The Return of Frank James"" will turn out alright (though I was so disappointed with ""Jesse"" that I've toyed with the idea of returning ""Frank"").Anyhow, sadly, I have to advise against getting this unless you don't care about the picture quality --- if PQ matters to you, you are bound to be disappointed."
3,Poor color dvd transfer,"I really like this film and it's sequel ""The Return Of Frank James"". I decided to upgrade from vhs to dvd for both titles. I was very disappointed to find that the dvd edition has very poor color. There's an overall dark tone and bluish cast to ""Jesse James"". On the other hand, ""The Return Of Frank James"" has great color. I tried these dvd's on 3 players just to be sure that my player or tv weren't out-of-balance. If you love the wonderful Technicolor films of this period, stick to the vhs edition of ""Jesse James"" or be prepared to turn your color button up as high as it will go to enjoy the dvd version. One would expect more from a major studio like Fox."
1,"Awful, just awful","Whatever significance this film has, it derives from the stellar cast. Tyrone Power and Henry Fonda do a credible job portraying Jesse and Frank James despite a screenplay that takes criminal liberties with the historical record. You may find it entertaining, but don't come away from it thinking you've learned anything useful about the James boys. The distortions become all the more shocking when you realize that there were still people alive in western Missouri who remembered the original people and events when this silly thing was released."
5,"an absolutely wonderful, nuanced story","Given that this was made in 1939, I was expecting a simple shoot-em-up with bad guys in black, etc. Happily, I found this is a subtle story about Jesse James, when he starts out as a wronged farmer and ends up a hardened criminal who has betrayed just about everyone and shown a self-destructive streak. He woos a lovely local girl, but essentially loses her as his transformation and the difficulties of life on the run make life together too difficult. It is sad, believable in spite of the heavy doses of melodrama, and a superbly constructed story. I loved cowboy films when growing up, but long ago lost interest in them, particularly after the advent of films like Little Big Man or Apache. This film is so good I must now consider whether to start collecting westerns!Warmly recommended."
4,Jesse revisited,"Jesse James was both outlaw and idol. He reacted in a way many would have liked to when wronged. Many have played the role of Jesse James, this classic remains one of the best. It is a must for any historical/western collector. With Tyrone Power, Henry Fonda and Randolph Scott playing the key characters you are in for a real treat in a movie you will watch over and over."
5,You will feel as if you were there,"I simply could not put this book down. The feelings it conveyed were amazingly real and profound. I thought that I would learn about the life of Mary Magdalene, and I absolutely did. However, the most astounding thing I learned from this book was what it felt like to be in the presence of Jesus. This book will exceed your expectations and expand your spiritual understanding."
5,Inspirational - Heart Warming,"I thought this book was wonderful - so many times I could hardly read through the tears in my eyes. Probably not a book for someone who believes everything in the Bible is the only truth however for someone searching for more answers than the Bible can provide this certainly gives another area to focus on from a woman's aspect. The back of the book states that this is Robert Grant's first novel and that he used ""inspirational writing"""
5,Timeless and Incredible !,"I have never in my life been a Chuck Mangione fan...until now. This music is very compelling,especially for someone like me who lives in the Southwest and is close to Mexico. Everytime I play this soundtrack Mangione's brilliant artistry paints the desert landscape in my mind perfectly each time. The vocals,instrumentation, melodies are quite breathtaking and memorable. Bella Via is simply just that;Beautiful. Lullabye,Consuelo's Love Theme are all about mood,feeling, and passion for life ! The most astounding feat of this soundtrack is how Mangione avoided using the stereotypical Mexican ""Hollywood"" soundtrack cliched Mariachi or the typical ""aye, aye , ya aye"" sound.At times there's almost a sort of New Age/Ambient approach to some tracks (even before New Age was recognized as a type of music back in the 70's). This is a very mystical and magical recording that will never lose it's spark !..."
5,I Will Always Hear the Children of Sanchez!,"This is definitely not Mangione's most accessible music, and some complain that some of the music are just re-recordings, but that's the beauty of this album. From the fanfare of ""Children of Sanchez (Overture)"" to the soft tones of ""Lullabye"" to the emotional ballad ""Consuelo's Love Theme"", this album brings out some of the best in Mangione. It was written in just three weeks, and perfectly captures the spirit of Mangione. It's a classic, and it goes without saying that Mangione himself still has plenty of excellent flugelhorn and trumpet solos. If you haven't bought this album, do so. You won't regret it."
5,Clearly this is Chuck's most superb masterpiece to date,"Twenty years ago I bought this album and played it until there were more scratches on it than music. The words and rythyms have played in my mind off and on since then. The music and lyrics are as beautifully emotional now as they were in the 70's. This CD was a ""must have"" for my collection and I'm delighted I finally have it."
4,Children Of Sanchez Movie Soundtrack,"Songs Include :""Children Of Sanchez Overture""""Lullabye""""Fanfare""""Pilgramage Part 1""""Pilgramage Part 2""""Consuelo's Love Theme""""Hot Consuelo""""Death Scene""""Market Place""""Echano""""Bellavia""""Lullabye""""Medley""""B'Bye""""Children Of Sanchez Finale"""
5,Chuck Mangione Children Of Sanchez,"This album has so much energy. It tells a great story. Fantastic Album, one of my favorites ever. I love it!"
5,Masterful,I purchased this on vinyl in the late 70's and loved it. of course I had lost it and forgotten why I was so enamoured of it. I remember the liner notes though I never saw the movie. This is one of the singularly best pieces of music I have ever heard. Passion explodes with every burst of Chuck's Trumpet. He explores the limits of his instrument with unapologetic enthusiasm. The message is all the more powerful for it's lack of polish. Chuck Mangione was a Master!
3,"Yeah,Yeah It'll WRITE itself,LOL !!!","Written and Directed by : Robbie Ribspreader.Dang,Imagine you have to do that term paper for the morning,Send the final draft of the Great Novel,Oh...script `Desperate Housewives' sequel with Nicole Sheridan ...It's not easy to be writer.Scribe Jack Jones is delivered a magical bottle of blood to inspire a muse of deathly proportions to him write his next novel, Try to outwit that plot Bucko.This film is actually pretty entertaining in a most macabre fashion, With dead hookers to boot.Writer Jack has a ` Lost Weekend ` or two trying to write at a typewriter,That notion alone needs explaining,My friend Ford Austin probably writes whole screenplays on his Droid phone."
2,Big disappointment,"This is Freddie and the often awful James Spaulding going over the edge. It's painful most of the time, especially in the opening title cut. I bought this because of the rave review on Amazon.com. Woe is me."
2,Ferrero Duplo Wafers,"They are fair. An acquired taste but at $7 for ten small pieces if you have not acquired the taste, I would stick to Kit Kats--smile.I must say did get the product on time as advertised but from the photo and the price I expected larger portions."
4,Ethereal Males,"A colleague just came by as this album was playing and asked ""What is that stuff - Clannad or something?"" When I showed him the cover he looked it over for a minute, and told me, ""you got some weird problems, man."" This is a very chanty, ethereal album, reminiscent of some old Dead Can Dance but a little lighter. The vocals are very hard to follow, and I usually play it just as background music when I'm writing or reading. The last two songs, apparently some unfinished bonus tracks, strangely start to speed up and become more like regular songs in an old-fashioned darkwave style."
3,So - So,"A well-done version for having be filmed in 1926. However, if one wants something easy to follow, this is not the version - too long, and the ending was unclear. (Fuast was restored to old age, but what about his soul?) The special effects, however, were remarkable for the time.In this movie Faust is an old scholar frustrated at his inability to help the local plague-stricken population. He summons Mephisto (the Devil) who offers a one day pact with no obligation. At the end of that day, at his request Faust has been restored to youth and helped to steal a lovely woman away from her groom and wedding feast. Faust agrees to extend the pact for eternity, become bored, returns home and falls in love with the innocent Gretchen. Mephisto's treacherousness, however, ruins Gretchen (her newborn child dies, she's burned at the stake for murdering it)."
5,"Visually stunning, but...","... the performance of the musical score is dreadful! The actuall composition is ok, but listen to the unbarable sound of the strings! Ghastly! Can't anybody tell Kino (and Eureka) to find an orchestra that know how to tune their instruments and keep the tone while playing them?The music actually destroyed the whole experience for me. Spectacular film otherwise, but I think Murnau is turning in his grave knowing a bunch of amateurs making sound to his pictures.The five stars are all for Murnau!Sincerely/Daniel (from Sweden)"
3,Faust DVD,I thought the effects were great. I enjoyed the movie but understanding the time in which it was made. I was a little disappointed they left out so much from the book.There are scenes from the story that just needed to be there. great book (play)by the way.
5,Nicely remastered version of F.W. Murnau's classic silent film,This is the second copy of Faust that I have purchased. I bought mine from the reseller because it was cheaper and because the last version I bought was a bargain bin version that was sub-standard to say the least. This version is well worth the 12 bucks I paid for it. Picture and sound quality are good with alot of the popping sounds gone.
5,Sick...,"IF YOU LIKE REGGAE/DUB/DANCEHALL...GET IT! NEED MORE HELP - IT'S RYAN MOORE WITH RANKING JOE, BIG YOUTH, ETC... IF NONE OF THIS CONVINCES YOU TO BUY IT THEN PLEASE DON'T. YOU KNOW NOTHING ABOUT GOOD REGGAE. IF YOU WANT TO BUY GOOD REGGAE THEN BUY IT."
3,Melodic pop not without charms!,"This unpretentiously melodic and sexy pop album somehow fell through the cracks of the early 90's (post)grunge Angst: undeservedly so! It's a lovely, smart and spunky pop vocally at times even reminiscent of Kate Bush (geez, I hope she changed her last name by now?) and yet the album somehow sizzles towards the end. The first few numbers are great (When I Do Wrong I Do It So Right, Girl Noise, Can I Call You Daddy?) and then by the time you'll get to the ""Adam's Got An Attitude"" you'll be hoping for a change in pace. More variety.Even if the album wears eventually down after more concentrated listening, it's still something I might come back to as one of the brighter tiny spots of the 90's musical Wastelands.I also liked her teasing and ambigous lyrics. Really not too bad."
5,"Spellbound ""Plus"" - Movie Soundtrack","Songs Include :""Main Theme""""The Dressing Gown""""Scherzo""""Love Theme""""The Burned Hand""""Spellbound""""The Dream""""Ski Run""""Finale""""Peter's Theme - I'll Catch The Sun""""I'm Only Me - 2 Girls Bathing""""Joanna In Paris - Run To Me Fly To Me""""Get On The Great Adventure""""Roadshow Overture To Around The World In 80 Days"""
2,Motor sounds,"I ordered 2 of these for our bedrooms. On the low speed the motor just whines and sounds like it wants to get started but just can't get up enough steam, if you get my drift. Too annoying to use in a bedroom for sure !!! I notice this model is now discontinued. No wonder....Other Hunter models do not seem to suffer this particular problem altho I can assure you they are all LOUD on anything but the lowest speed. And Hunter calls them ""whisper quiet""....NOT !!!"
2,Not impressive,"The first purifier I had to return because it started smelling like something was smoldering. The replacement is working ok as of now,but I don't see any difference in the air. Everything seems the same as far as my breathing is concerned. Just a waste of money in my opinion.Replacement filters are too expensive."
2,"Say ""Squeeze!""","First of all, there was nothing wrong with the quality of the product. However, the sizing is anyone's guess! I will say that I ordered a small because that's what I am and have been for years. There was NO POSSIBLE hope of squeezing into this VERY TIGHT slip without a trip to the emergency room. I returned it. I'm a size 2 dress/pant, XS/Small blouse type girl and I'm worried even the medium might be too small! ORDER AT LEAST A SIZE UP."
2,Very Uncomfortable,"I understand this is shapewear, but does it have to be so uncomfortable? This is the first time I tried shapewear so I am not sure if they are all like this, or if it is just this particular brand. And I did buy the right size."
5,Hard hitting and challanging,I was so impressed by this book that I tracked down the author to tell him so. It is a book that assists people in focusing on problem solving in relationships. The authors use of stories and metaphors is very relevant to the reader. The book is one that you will want to read and re-read. I am now buying copies for my closest friends who I know will benefit from the book. 20/20 is a winner!
1,Horrible - not worth the paper it's printed on,"Don't waste your time on this book and don't waste any more of your time considering purchasing this book. I've never read a book which is so confusing and pointless. 20/20 Insight is the wrong title - they should call it ""Read this book and you won't be able to see a thing"" or ""Turn off the lights and begin to not understand anything about business."" This guy must be blind when it comes to the world of consulting. I've never been so confused after reading a book. I kept reading hoping things would get better, but I just become more and more confused. His examples are silly and don't really apply. Again, don't read this book!!!!!"
5,20/20 Insight,"I found this book to be excellent!! Anyone that wants to transform their life, finances and business should read this book. Randy Gibbs puts everything into perspective and very manageable so that anyone can make the proper changes. I highly recommend this book to anyone!!"
4,ANY outdoor bench MUST be maintained,"In response to the negative reviews on this bench stating they only last 5-6 years, I would like to say that a bench that lasts only that long would be expected if the wood is not maintained. I have owned several wooden benches, including this Iris Bench, and every couple of years I simply re-coat with a water-seal product and they typically last for many years....BUT, if you don't, then I would believe that @ 5 years would seem a fair use expectancy, also depending on what kind of weather they are exposed to.For the price, this bench was a good buy. Mine is still in good shape...and...I've had it more than 5 years."
1,Not Durable,Had a garden bench similar to this from Berkeley Forge & Foundry. It only lasted 5 years and totally fell to pieces. I wouldn't buy anything from them again.
5,Works Like a Charm,"We bought the pink waistband for out daughter who has gas and stomach cramps and cries whenever she is bloated. As soon as we warm it up and put it on (fairly tight, but not too tight) she calms down. She sleeps much better with it on even though it's no longer emitting heat.The only thing we might complain about is that my husband does not like the chamomile smell of the heating pad. But neither I nor our baby mind.BTW, we got it when she was a couple weeks old and she is four months now and we still use it.We would definitely recommend this to babies who have gas pain or are colicky."
5,Perfect Gift from this Great Uncle,"I now have three VERY happy (happi?) great-nieces and nephew who have each benefitted from this great uncle's gift of a Happi Tummi. Their parents have been very appreciative and tell me their kids even want their Happi Tummi on for their naps, now, too. I highly recommend this simple and effective product."
4,Great idea!,"This works great for my 5 month old baby when he is gassy and fussy. My only complaints are that since it velcros in the back it is hard to secure it on tight when I am getting it on him myself, also it is really long and big for him so the velcro barely meets, and he is not a small boy. I can't imagine it fitting a newborn well."
2,Just ok.,"I thought this would be perfect, as our daughter was having lots of tummy aches and was obviously uncomfortable. I couldn't get it to stay on her. She's very active, so this might not be a problem for less active babies. Overall, it didn't do what we hoped."
1,I don't think this helps at all ....,"We've tried this a number of times and we just don't think it works (for our baby). Of course, it's hard to know what's *really* causing a baby to cry frequently, so I was skeptical that it would work to begin with. But one *should* buy this with a healthy dose of skepticism. Of course, if you've got a baby that cries a lot, it's probably worth trying anything and everything."
2,We were so desperate!,This product is ok. The herbs smell good but I didn't see a difference in behavior. I was able to use the outside as an ice pack for me later.
4,Well worth the money,This wrap doesn't cure gas but it always makes the baby more comfortable. Seeing my baby in pain is terrible so anything I can do to lessen that is worth it. I will be buying this as a gift for baby showers in the future.
1,Not worth it,I didn't see this work for my son. He had a lot of gas pains when he was first born and nothing really seemed to help him. I didn't really see any change in him when he wore it. In fact it often times made him pretty angry.It did have a funky smell but it wasn't terribly offensive. The minky material is soft and it was well made. I just wish that it would have worked.
4,Works ok,I like the concept - like an herbal heating pad. I'm not sure it helped but I know that I will use it again even if just for the heat.
1,Not worth it,"Good in theory, but it did absolutely nothing for my son and the velcro does not stick very well, so it had to be held on. A waste of my $20!! Would not recommend unless you simply want a heating pad for other reasons."
2,mom of a colicky 2 month old,"I was really excited whne I received this product. I wanted not only to help my infant but myself as well. I was dissapointed in it's performance for a number of reasons. My baby still cried for hours on end. She hated the belt being around her tummy and would stiffen up. The product needs a warning label for certain microwave temps. It does tell you to check the product before putting it on baby, however the ""seeds"" in the scented pouch get warmer the longer you hold them against your skin, by then you've already attached it to your child. My infant had little red marks on her tummy for a few hours after I'd tried it! I think this is dangerous especially for new mom's like myself. Do your self a favor, spend the fifty buck and buy a lullaband, or some collic tablets or gripe water!"
3,Okay,"The Happi Tummi was not the miracle I hoped it would be. It is soft and smells really good. I warmed it up 10 - 15 seconds in the microwave and had no trouble with burning the baby. I put it on her tummy and wrapped a blanket around her. These together would warm her up and I think that helped to calm her down. She did not have colic, but fussy, gassy evenings."
3,Not too sure,"I'm not too sure if this actually helped her gas and colic, however I am still using it as a general heating pad for my daughter."
3,Doesn't fit a toddler,"Our daughter didn't have issues until she got older, and I was willing to try anything to help her sleep. I had to return this because it didn't fit her (she's 14 months and thin). Its probably only meant for an infant. The product itself was very soft and nice quality. We used it once, and she was too aware of the warm thing on her tummy - she wanted it off. You really have to make sure its not too hot. Smelled very soothing though."
1,WARNING!!,This waistband caused a second degree burn on my 4 month old.With a blister larger than a quarter. We followed direections precisely and had used it successfully 4 previous times. This product is extremely dangerous and needs to be pulled from the market and that will be my goal!! PLEASE do not buy this product or give as a gift. I am also a very experienced mother of 4 and NICU nurse. I repeat this product is very dangerous!!!!!
4,Helpful for us!,"I ordered this out of desperation. I think that it has been helpful for our now 1 month old. I enjoy the scent, my husband says that it's a bit strong for him. I microwave for 15 seconds, then wrap it on over her clothes, then swaddle her arms, and snuggle with her when she's screaming with gas pains, and usually within 1-2 minutes (sometimes shorter) she is much calmer (and quiet). I don't use it a whole lot, only when everything else hasn't worked, so to reserve it for when we really need it. I like it and would buy it again."
2,Didn't work for us - returned it,My infant daughter was a little gassy so we tried this. She didn't like sleeping with it around her waist so I returned it. I tried gripe water after that and it helped.
3,Disappointed that it does nothing for my baby....,"Service and delivery product was great - came in the mail in a short period of time. I'm just disappointed that my fussy and borderline colicky baby showed no improvement when I put this on her tummy....still wailing and screaming at the top of her lungs (after trying it out on her more than once).Seems a bit gimmicky to me but I had to give this a try, too bad this did nothing for my little one!"
2,Cute... but not very effective.,It's very soft. The lavender smell is very nice. It did not provide relief for my baby though.
2,Very large,"This was too big for our baby, would fit a toddler better or a chunky 9+ month old. Not sure if it works as it was just too big when we needed it."
3,Of interest to Japanophiles,"Been working on this 19th century travelogue off and on for a few months now. Mostly because the description is largely as tedious as a quarterly meeting. If you can wade through the endless descriptions of ""jungle"" and ""savages"", there are some interesting insights into life in a Japan just on the cusp of modernization (Isabella Bird traveled there in 1878). But onlyif you've got a vested interest in Japan and the Japanese countryside in particular, like myself. You can buy it if you want to, but I wouldn't.Of interest to a certain streak of Japanophile only."
2,"Overpriced for a ""so-so"" filter.",My wife picked up a set of Hunter air purifiers on QVC. The price of replacement filters is outrageous. Nothing special about them and I don't really notice an improvement in air quality.
4,positive review,"I have to replace my filter from time to time, I'm happy with the company, the price is a little high."
3,"See the movie, maybe get the CD","Five stars should imply perfect in every way. Though this CD is good, it's not among my top 500 CDs, and the claim by one review that these versions are better than the originals is totally over-the-top. Another reason that I deducted stars was that my favorite performance from the movie, ""You Really Got Me"", is not on this CD Soundtrack. The creativity and Eddie Van Halen techniques that 12 year old CJ Tywoniak employed on this song were jaw-dropping, and there is simply no excuse for not including it. I would rate the movie 4 stars and I gave the CD 3 stars.I recommend you see the movie first and buy the CD if you must. The music is much better with the visuals of kids playing very difficult rock songs."
3,Great--if you are a really accomplished baker,"I am a somewhat intermediate baker and have had a LOT of difficulty with these recipes. The chocolate genoise, for example, despite two attempts failed. I consulted another source as to the method some important steps were left out. I have found that unless you can ""read between the lines"" and automatically know how to do the more difficult things, then you are going to have little success with this book. It is, however, beautifu and inspiring and I've enjoyed reading it and getting ideas--the chocolate topping for the genoise is DIVINE, as is the caramel/chocolate tart/shortbread."
3,More of a documentary than a novel,"World war II submarines could stay under water for a limited amount of time. When in enemy waters, they submerged most of the day and surfaced at night to recharge their batteries. This novel is set in the waters of occupied Norway during the arctic summer when there is no night !! As a consequence, the protagonists are in constant danger of detection. The events are fairly predictable, but there are many details regarding life aboard the submarine that make this book worth reading."
3,Excellent condition; ponderous book,"The book is beautifully printed though there are typos, which shocks me from Harvard University Press. The reverential tone makes it tough going for me, and I read many biographies of theatrical and literary personages. Miller is important in theatre history and in the canon, but he isn't God – as his later life (in particular, the institutionalization of his high-functioning Down Syndrome son) – attests."
5,very good read,"I thought this was a very interesting and informative book. It gave me a lot of information about different jobs.As for the upset people who rated this book low, i'm sure Les rated firemen higher than nurses in stress level because some nurses work in a low stress environment in some kind of pediatric aera, giving shots to little kids, while firemen have to be ready all the time when they are on call. And as for librarians, well, reccomending a book or showing someone to a copy of Moneyball doesn't really compare in stress to making international relations decisions or having to make a precise cut with a scalpel."
1,questionable information,"This book (while the idea may be to expose you to various fields) is not a good resource for a person to rely to heavily on. When one tries to rank jobs based on stress, one will fail. The same jobs in different parts of the country or different companies will have VERY different stress levels. This can be very misleading to someone thinking a Medical Record Tech (schooled and credentialed) has the least stressful job. Tell that to the tech who gets the rath of a physcian for asking them to comply with the rules the Medical Staff of a hospital determines. Or try telling it to the tech down in the trenches who as the finance people demaning more with less. I think he treads on dangerous territory to assume that some jobs have better enviroments than others. Let's just say if you are looking for jobs, this may be a start, but you really need to talk to people and see just what their day is like.....not read about it from someone else...."
1,No Clue!!!,"The author of this book has no clue the work of librarians. I have been a public librarian for almost 8 years, at a reference desk. The stress level is high at many times. Whereas the author thinks librarians have low stress levels. Librarians, especially public ones, deal every day with all types of people. Also librarians deal with many different tasks at one time. Librarians do not sit around reading books. This book is pretty much worthless. Anyone who buys it is wasting their money"
5,salonsip aqua-patch,I first used salonsip gel patches whilst on a walking holiday in north vietnam in 2011.after a fall and spraining my ankle the guide gave me a aqua-patch to put on.after putting these patches on for a few days they reduced the swelling and bruising had a great cooling effect with the smell of menthol.a great piece of kit to keep in your first aid kit for those emergencies.i bought these through amazon but was disappointed with postage charges which turned out to be more than the patches.however the patches are worth the money.
1,Idiotic,I cannot believe the reviews on this book. I am black and have never heard the slang terms used this book and the sex scenes are mediocre for a woman supposedly addicted to sex. This is the first book I have read by Zane and will give her one more chance to write a book with a somewhat believable story line and without an ending that comes out of nowhere. Read at your own risk.
3,I was disappointed...,"Not to say that you would be but I was. This book and author came HIGHLY recommended to me by a friend, so it was already hyped up in my mind I guess.The story was interesting enough and I enjoyed Zane's writing style, but Zoe was getting on my nerves! She had this perfect husband and I just didn't feel like she was really sorry about her addiction.Fortunately, I decided to give Zane another shot and read the sequel Nervous. That, in my opinion, was much better."
1,UNREALISTIC,"This book was sooo predictable it's funny. I was really disappointed, because I thought it's going to be a lot better. It wasn't suspenseful, it was nothing just boringggg and so unrealistic."
5,Best Book Ever!,"Ashley A. 4BThough most adults may think teenagers are too young for ""relationship"" books, I think this book proves them wrong. This book starts from when they were young and continues to adult hood and that's why I really enjoyed it so much. So, If you love to read relationship books then, this is the one for you."
2,Just Okay,"This was long read for me. Took me 6 days to read it..It start out really slow. The last half of the book was the best. Instead of 300 plus pages it could have been condense into 200 pages. For all the crab Zoe did it ended unrealistic Jason deserved better than than the trifling ""Bitch"""
3,"Good, not great",This book was good but it did seem to get a bit unrealistic at times.....how can so many jacked up things happen to one person? All in all it was a good read though.
5,Addictive read!!!,Absolutely great read! What a page turner! I enjoyed reading every page. It had a lot of twists and turns and wasn't easy to predict as I read along. Zane does it again! Wow!
5,Whoa,"""This book has you wondering from the beginning until the end..a great story. I'm waiting for the movie :-)"
1,The zero star option was not available....,"maybe if i had a g.e.d. and read one or two books a year, i might think this is special, but this is just ludicrous. the only reason why zane is successful is because there is a market for black erotica. i have seen 4 black anthologies in the past year alone, so, naturally, a major publisher, is going to pick up her book based on her rep and sales...but a rep and sales doesnt make her a great writer. her style is elementary. graphic to the point of clinical and is beyond hyperbole.but then most people who read black books don't really care about the story or how well it's written so long the guy and the girl get together in the end. it's a shame more talented writers are being slighted, while delusional hacks like her become famous..."
2,Nor Addicted or Hooked to Zane,After hearing my sis talking about this author I had to read one of her book and was I disappointed. There is no realism in her novels...and its nothing but SEX SEX SEX...thats how the reader gets HOOKED into her books....I agree with one of the reviewer who called this PORN ON PAPER...this is crazy...what happened to classics like Jane Eyre....Frankenstine....Beloved....Macbeth...have we as society stooped so low that all we can do is talk about sex and leave out other important issues....okay...so she got over her sex addiction that was related to her childhood sexual abuse...but how does that add up in the end...so she is an sex addict and her husband is a whore's son....WOW...way to go ZANE...I wonder if this book has some autobiographical pieces in it....hmmmm....I WONDER....well if you can't entertain brilliant brains than dont write at all....I rest my case
4,It was okay...........................,"I heard all the hype about this book and decided to order it. The only thing that caught my eye were the sex scenes! They had me running to get water I was so HOT, but the story overall was not as good as I thought it would be. Like someone else mentioned the writing is for someone in their teens not really for adults. I did not like the way this book ended at all and when I found out why she was addicted to sex I was like what meaning I thought it was something deeper.Overall this book gets a 4 more like a 3.9."
4,Fun book kept me entertained for hours,I really enjoyed this book so much in fact I finished it in 3 days. I found myself not being able to walk away from it. I think for all the people who are giving such negative feedback what I want to say to you is this is fiction some parts are supposed to be unbelievable. Its not Time Life Books or National Geographic. So stop analizying every chapter and enjoy it.
3,O.k. and spicy,"This book is o.k. worth the money , but do not think you are going to get a best seller, but you do get a book with a good plot the ending kind of [stinks] but the book overall was o.k"
3,Teen reading at best,"I expected so much more from all the hype surrounding this novel. The writing was solid in the voice of the children and teenage years which leads me to believe the author may well be suited to write for that age bracket. When it came to the adult portions, I was disappointed."
2,What?,Check back. I will have a real review written in a few days. I am just giving star ratings on all the books I read this year.
1,How many cliche can one sentance have?,"I had the misfortune of reading as much of this book as I could stomach. Not only is the story line weak, but even worse is Zane's writing style - cliche after cliche passing for prose. Our book-club has UNANIMOUSLY agreed to trash it. Do yourself a favor and purchase something else."
1,THIS BOOK WAS SO BAD IT WAS GOOD,"I read this book in one sitting. Not because I thought it was the ""literary"" masterpiece some of the other reviewers called it but because it was absolutely RIDICULOUS! I couldn't put it down because when I was not laughing I was shaking my head. The editing (was there any?) was terrible. The story was not believable. I found it hard to accept that a woman like Zoe, an alledged intelligent business woman, could be hopping in and out of bed with met she hardly knew and NOT ONCE MENTION SAFE SEX! What intelligent woman in her right mind would do all that? Would she really do all that without using a condom?! The encounter with Diamond was mentioned as an afterthought with very little details. I will not read any more books by this author until she learns to write like a professional!"
4,Changed lives,"I wondered into the Africian American section of the local Borders when this book caught my eye. Glad I purchased it. I throughly enjoyed the book ""Addicted"" by Zane. I found it provocative, stimulating and educational. Zoe's opening scene in this book characterized the fears of many Africian American who need, but won't seek counseling.As her story unfolds, her detailed description of her childhood helped to make the end of the story even more profound. Excellent reading. I did find, however, the use of profanity by Zoe in her general conversation, rather offensive and over used. I found a hint of Christianity in the counselor which gave a glimmer of hope that Zoe's life would change.This book could be used as a counseling tool for those suffering from sexual addiction. Thanks Zane for your contribution. At least one more life will be changed because of your writing."
1,Not For The Savvy Reader!,If you enjoy a thoughtful read -- Addicted is not for you. It is a juvenile attempt at discussing meaningful concepts. I found the book very shallow and somewhat interesting.
1,Nasty!!!!!,"A friend of my 15-year-old daughter recommended this book to her. I was just about to order it when I decided to read the excerpts. I thank the Lord God that I did. What I read was disgusting!!! Just flat out NASTY!!! Ironically, the girl that suggested this book to my daughter is her 17-year-old, 7-month-pregnant, eleventh-grade friend. Hmmm...!!!"
3,very sexual book,This book is very sexual it is an o.k. book the story line is good but the way the author went around to wrinting the book is wrong in my opinion. But all in all and o.k. book
4,It was a page turner,"I read addicted yesterday It took me a day to read it. It was a real page turner. Some weaknesses in the book I didnt like, Like how at the end she leave us in suspense about the 3rd lover and she wind up sleeping with quinton neighbor. I didnt like that part. How the end It was starting to get good when they made up thats when it should of stopped after brina killer died. But they went through all of that to make it somewhat a thriller at the end. I wasnt feeling the end at all. but it was a great book to say the least."
5,Sheer Enjoyment,"This is one of the best books that I have ever read. I read this book within 2 days because I simply couldn't put it down. My intentions were to read the last 100 pages the following day, but instead I ended up staying up until 4:30 in morning finishing it."
5,Don't End!,"Don't end is what you will be screaming when you see this book is about to end. Really, it was that good. This is the first time I picked up a book by Zane and I'm not disappointed one bit. The title grabbed you and the plot reeled you. It was very fast paced and interesting. You will be on the end of your seat wanting to know what happened next. One word describes the regret that plague the main characters and it's ""If"". If... Jason had only listened to Zoe. If...Jason had only talked to Zoe about his premature exposure to sex. Zoe may not have engaged in her crazy azz behaviors. Not saying she's innocent, but she was a victim of circumstances beyond her control on all ends. I will say no more. Just this, run don't walk to get your copy of ""Addicted"" Its fabulous."
5,I was ADDICTED to finishing this book,"What can I say? It took me one day to read this book and I had refused to go to sleep or do anything else until it was finished. HOT HOT HOT. Zane really delievered with this book. I mean you hear about men addicted to sex, but never women. Zoe went through so much pain and many emotions. Even though she was cheating on her husband, I still felt that she loved Jason more than anything. This book shows what happens when you cheat and all you can lose in the process. An excellent read."
5,finished and was left semi-satisfied,"as i read addicted, it dragged me in deeper and deeper into the world of zoe. i could somehow relate to her, as i got nearer and nearer to the end i was disappointed that the book was ending. i wanted it to keep going on and on for ever. but as i got to the understanding of who the third lover was, i was shocked, well not really, i sort of guessed from the get go. it reminded me of my life, running around with various people chasing me for the ""good stuff"". i'm currently awaiting more books to be delivered to my mail box since i live overseas to read. thanks zane"
3,Too much of a good thing,"This guy in the parking lot talked me half to death when he found out I was reading a book by Zane, the library has a horrible time trying to keep Zane's book in stock because they always disappear, and word of mouth is like a beauty salon. So curiosity sent me to the bookstore to buy her book. I thought the opening was magnetic, the main plot was funny (a lady who believes she's a nymphomaniac and goes to a doctor to be cured) and entertaining, and I liked the character. But the lesbian story seemed more like an afterthought (unnecessary), the story should've ended at the hypnotizing because that was creative and explained the underlying secret, and Jason's secret was wack. I also thought the word p*ssy was used too much for my taste, especially for a young girl."
3,"Good book, but somewhat misleading","Yes, this book was a page-turner, but it was somewhat unrealistic. Mainly that there was no discussion of possible STD or AIDs testing after she realized she was an addict. For that reason alone, I could not conceive of giving any more than 3 stars. I think authors should write responsibly. I could identify with the main character, but, the author should have stressed or at least mentioned annual exams, pap smears, stds, etc. This omission marred what was otherwise a stellar book."
5,I Was Addicted!!!,"This book had me turnin pages like you wouldn't believe. I couldn't put it down, and finished it in two days flat. This is a must read for those looking for a book that will keep them hooked from beginning to end."
5,"This was my first read by Zane, and now i'm ""Addicted""","This is a must read. This book offered everything that I wasnt used to getting in 1 package. Sex, Mystery, Suspense, it had it all and was sooo good. It also had a good story line. I am definitely a Zane fan Now and will not stop until I read all of her books. Harris and Dickey are my boys, but this female has definitely put a new spin on African American fiction and im loving it."
5,One of Zane's Best!,"One of the best books I've read, this book held my interest from start to finish! I couldn't put it down. After reading this book you can't help but become a fan of Zane's. I loved it, and all my friends loved it too!"
5,GOOD READ,THIS WAS ONE OF THE FIRST BOOK THAT I READ. IT KEPT ME WANTING TO READ MORE AND MORE. I COULD NOT PUT THIS BOOK DOWN.
4,"Let's get hot, emotional, and tragic","Addicted is one of Zane's deepest novel. This book is really good. It's about a lady who feels she can't trust or fully get commited to any men because of what happened to her in the past. Then she meets up with this guy she thought was nothing good for her, until he started doing everything she loves and never knew a man could do. So it gets sexual and with the great detail of the love making, I mean it seems as if your the one who's being pleased. I would definitely recommend this book to people who love drama, sex, and tragic escapades. Also read her other novels."
5,Addictive,"A page turner. I couldn't put it down. If you want to read about true love with some twists and turns,you must read Addicted. Thanks Zane for the journey into your imagination."
4,Caught My Attention From Page ONE!,"Addicted is a story that grabbed me from the beginning and just never let go of me until the end. If you're looking for a little erotica mixed with an exciting story, this is definitely the book for you! I thought a few things in the book were a little ""over the top"" but I don't want to give examples because it would probably ruin the book. I thought that some of her lovers should have just MOVED ON and not gotten so ""addicted"" to Zoe but I'm sure there probably are some CRAZY people out there so I can't hold that against the author too much. I also personally thought that Jason was just a little too quick to forgive her for all she'd done but that's just MY opinion! :-) Overall, though, I found this book very fun and exciting to read and I must admit that I was SHOCKED at the ending!"
2,I was totally disapointed.,I read her previous book and it was pretty cool but this one I am not too happy with. I was totally disapointed in the beginning and the ending. The middle was pretty decent but all else was horrible.
5,What a book!!!.,"From the first page until the last page I was ADDICTED!!! Friends and a close cousin of mine told me about this book. I'm glad I read it and will be discussing this book at an upcoming book club meeting.When Zoe started her spiral into cheating, all I wanted to do was go through the book and slap her!! Slap her for being so stupid and obsessed with sex she was willing to lose everything. Then you could not help but feel sorry for her a little. Then I could not understand why Jason was the way he was regarding sex with his wife. When all the answers came out, everything made sense.I also wanted to grab Briana and shake some sense into her. Zane touched on a sesitive topic that many women do not want to face. Loving yourself enough that you would let no man abuse you.This book was not only [wonderful], but full of mystery. I'm looking forward toreading more of Zane's work. A great read!!!"
3,addicted or just plain unhappy?,"""shame on it all"" was the book of the month for my book club and although i didn't feel it was the BEST book, i bought and read ""sex chronicles"" even after hearing mixed reviews. although ""sex chronicles"" was offffff the hook it did become a bit redundant but i liked it, so i felt that ""addicted"" would be a good read also...... well, it was ok. it was a definite page turner however towards the end it became a bit far fetched with all the mystery and drama ... and truth be told i was a bit disappointed at the end .. but i did recommend it to tmy friends because it was (if nothing else) an interesting read."
4,Very Entertaining,"This is good entertainment, the pages seem to fly by. It isn't something that is going to move you emotionally but, it probably isn't supposed to."
4,a good book,I really liked this book a lot. It is so good to where you are not going to be able to put the book down. I read this book in one day that is how much I liked it. The end of the book is very odd you would never think that that would ever happen in that book because it doesn't seem like that type of book for that ending.
1,Horrific,"This is by far, the most ridiculous attempt at a book I have ever encountered. It staggers the mind to consider that the author made any effort to write it, and on top of that, that it was actually published.The book is composed like a 5th grade book report; shallow to the point that you wonder if the author spent as much time writing it as you did reading it, immature in both content and style, and generally pointless. The concept of sexual addiction is far more profound than either Zane's unlikeable character, Zoe, or her exploration of it which never manages to rise above the sea of vulgarity and graphic descriptions of the act itself.This is the sort of book for people who believe that anyone who can read can write."
4,too good for words,"WOW this is like a black, 2004 version of Basic Instinct mixed with Fatal Attraction. this book is very good because A LOT of women can relate to Zoe. sexually repressed, successful black mother. now this had some twists and turns, but it ended kinda too perfect. nothing in these situations turns out that good. however this book kinda changed my views on infidelity. some people really cheat for other reasons besides being selfesh, low-minded and dumb. Zoe has some DEEP dark secrets from her past and present that was needed to come out. and when it rains....it POURS!!! it's an exciting read. have fun and enjoy it. it definitley needs to made into a movie."
2,Waste of Money,"This book dragged. I did not care to read about how they met. That could have been summed up a couple of pages.The story was about a women that was addicted to sex. She was always more than willing to expeience something new and she wanted to do it with her ""two-minute"" husband.The downfall came with the ""reasoning"" for this addiction. I don't understand why she couldn't be red blooded women that loved sex. Why did Zane have to bring the story down with undeveloped story of a younger Zoe (main character) seeing a sex act. Give me a break!I have had it with Zane. I have read three of her books and that was three too many."
3,"It was okay, but......","....I was expecting more. The story seemed cut very short and extremely predictable at the end. Just once I'd like for a book to end leaving you wondering ""what if?"". She has an affair with a woman and I definitely thought this should have been explored a little bit more. Also her husband Jason has some issues as well, and I thought they could have talked about that more too. Also one of the men she has an affair with has some serious mental problems and I don't really know why that was thrown into the book, I didn't see the point. I'm glad that another reviewer touched on the fact that safe sex wasn't even mentioned AT ALL, yet she's running around with men she doesn't even know their last names and doesn't even mention condoms or anything, even when she sees one of the men she's having an affair with having sex with another woman. It was a cool book, but nothing I would consider Black erotica. Just a good romp in the hay. Nothing erotic about it at all."
3,ok,It was ok. It has been over a month since I have read this book. I still remember the characters well. I guess that says something. However they seemed a bit more on the trashy side vs the classy. This made the sex in the book more vulgar than erotic.
3,Expected a bit more,"This book was okay for entertainment. To me, the story was a bit unrealistic in the end and the sex scenes didn't grab me. It wasn't the worst book that I'd read, but the storytelling just wasn't the best to me. It was just okay."
2,Mixed Bag,The plot of Addicted is fantastic. The cover is gorgeous. The blurb is intriguing. The writing alas reminded me of a child's easy reader book.
3,Good Book....,"Addicted is very well written and easy to read. However, I expected a little bit more from it. Sure, it was enteraining, but I didn't think that it depicted anything ""real"". Unless someone was born with exceptional bad luck, I don't see how they can meet so many disturbing and disfunctional people in the span of just a of couple months. I took the book for what it was: pure fiction and nothing more (maybe sci-fi). I do however recommend this book to all who are seeking to escape from reality. It will definitly do the trick! But if you are trying to relate to the characters, it may be kind of difficult. Anyway, enjoy!"
3,Not As Good As Everyone Says,This book was just okay. The beginning was extremely slow and it starts to move a little bit faster after Chapter 11. I couldn't really get into this book and wouldn't recommend it.
2,A very sad addiction,"I was hoping for a more titillating book of fun and sexual escapes, but somehow I read into more of a real-life human story of someone's real pain of her sad sexual addiction. I wouldn't recommend this book or even pass it on to a friend."
1,I'm not addicted,"I feel that Zane is too over rated, people who read her books just blow her up to the point where your actually expecting some good reading, but then you are let down, well at least I was.So, Zoe was addicted to sex, I'm sorry, but I do not buy the bull crap, can we at least refer to someone who's addicted to sex prominsciuos or a flat out dog.................the book was very dull and the begginning was very slow, it took me a couple of days just to read the first chapter. I didnt even get a chance to finish reading the book because it was so terrible, I got about a hundred pages from the end where at Zoe was at it with her multiple lovers, then I just put it down, because the whole ""I'm addicted to sex"" attitude is so tired, would I refer this book to anyone, NO!"
3,No Profound Ideologies but a Racy Summer Read!!!,"... yes, it's not exactly a Pulitzer Prize Winning Great Work of Literature. The plot is a little predictable at times and sometimes you want to curse out the protagonist. But yet, it is impossible to stop reading! Its like one of those songs you can't stand but know all of the words to. Its suspenseful, erotic and fast-paced. Everyone I know who's read it could not put it down. A fabulous read for a day at the beach or a lazy afternoon indoors. Addicted is a truly addictive book."
4,A Little Bit of Everything,"This was the first book I read by Zane. After reading Addicted in a day and a half, I'm planning on reading all of her books. This book was impossible to put down. I laughed and I cried. Zane makes her characters very memorable and easy to relate to. This book has a little bit of everything in it: Comedy, romance,eroticism, and major drama. I can't wait to read ""Sex Chronicles"""
1,A book that deserves a sequel,When I read this book I could not put it down. The way Zoe met Jason was so adorable and how they started dating. It was like a ghetto version of cinderella. Even though she had a problem her husband sticked by her side. I recommend this book for everyone. I think that Zane should write this as a sequel cuz I really want to know what's going on with zoey and Jason
1,Very Disappointed...,"I went to the local bookstore and purchased this book recently. I had just got done reading a great book by Terry McMillan and wanted another one to read. I was so disappointed with this book. I thought the writing was bad and the book never really had any high points, just lows. I wouldn't recomend this book to anyone."
4,Dirty mouthed child,"I would have to say ..the adult version of the character Zoe has less of a dirty mouth then her as a child..She swore and used terminology that a child in elementary school would never use.EVEN in front of her parents...AS IF THAT WOULD EVER HAPPEN in a REAL MIDDLE CLASSED FAMILY??.The slang was not even on point with the atmosphere of the story.They were in the suburbs ..not the ghetto..IT WAS OVERBOARD.The actual ending of the adult Zoe was more interesting then the whole drawn out beginning of her childhood..The ""tragic"" news about her husband/childhood b/f was quite exstreme...And unbelievable..Especially that he would never tell for all those years....This is trully a FICTION...the erotica was the only believable part of the story.."
3,If you want the truth... this book wan FAR from amazing,"The book started out with potential, at mid point it became a bit too Cinderella and then I don't know what happened, but the ending turned into Murder he/she/everybody wrote! This book gets a 3 because it does qualify as a page turner, but the author seems to get lost in the end and feeds its readers with a bunch of impossible story twisting nonsense."
1,Awful Just Plain Awful,This book was awful just plain awful. This is probably why Oprah quit picking books for her book club. It was poorly written and executed. It was just ridiculous at the end. Every other page there was one ridiculous scenario after another. I am starting to think that Zane is a man. The erotica if you can call it that was callous and not even sexy. AWFUL - Avoid at all costs
4,A True Love Addiction,"In reading this book I was not surprised by it's content a lot of us choose more provocative ways to get our points across. I was urged to read this book by a friend who heard about it from someone she concluded that the character was simply insatiable, I read it and I enjoyed it. Zane's book was about a woman who loved her husband but needed more than he was willing to offer at that time. Her addiction was more about her love for her husband than her lust with infidelity I think it wasn't as clear and cut as it should have been."
1,A Hot Mess!!! Why is this book a bestseller????,"I thought this was 1 of the worst books I have ever read........ I am still trying to figure out why this book is so popular, the writing is so amatuerish & annoying. Who is this book supposed to appeal to? I truly believe the graphic sex in this book is the only reason people are drawn to it and are recommending it to others.What a waste of money. I am considering writing a book now, Hell, if people are digging this mess, I know I can write a book.I gave this book away, I didn't even want it in my bookcase. ..."
1,Not ADDICTED to Zane,"The only reason why I finished this book was because I have a creed to finish all books that I start. This book had to be in the top three worst books that I've read in all my life. I skimmed through some pages just to finish. The characters were severely underdeveloped and the story line was despairingly shallow. The concept would have worked with a different flavor but Zane failed miserably. If erotica is going to be the dominant thread throughout a piece, then it should be presented with taste and proper form. Two thumbs down on this one."
1,Proves that Anything can get Published,"Oh. My. God. This has to be one of the worst books I have ever read. Unrealistic, one-dimensional characters that fling slang back and forth in meaningless dialogue. No depth of conversation.I've read better erotic stories online in Google Groups -- for free!What a waste of my library's funds."
2,Don't Believe the Hype,"After hearing a great deal of fanfare about Zane, I picked up Addicted while waiting in the airport during a 2 hour layover. I will say that the book was a page turner, but not because it was unpredictable. There was simply a lot of drama, and well, who doesn't enjoy drama in a novel? Aside from that, the characters lacked development, and there was zero imagination in the dialogue and plot development. As other reviewers have noted, the sex scenes left much to be desired; they were lackluster and again, lacked in imagination. I was also disturbed by the lack of mention of condom usage and that Zoe seemed to have no reprecussions for the many unprotected sex seesions she had. Overall, this book was a waste of money and time. There are so many more good texts by Black writers."
2,If you have NOTHING better to do...,"then you may enjoy this book. I, however, thought it was pretty poorly written. I actually finished the whole book, which is really quite amazing given the vocabulary alone. I cannot believe the great reviews this book has gotten here, which is why I decided to try this book in the first place. I was pretty excited to read it, and then very quickly disappointed. The best parts of the book, in my opinion, were the very mediocre sex scenes. I'm in no way looking for soft core porn here, but at least those parts were interesting.If you're looking for a good book try something else..."
1,There are way too many typo's,I couldn't get through the first chapter due to the interruptions of words that are connected. I stopped reading the book.I wish I could get a REFUND.....
1,Awful writing.,"I'm no writer but I thought this was terribly written. Too much unnecessary description in some parts, silly slang usage, poor story. I was so happy to be done with it."
1,Addicted,"It took too long to develop the story and once the main character began her sexcapades it was disappointing (definitely not addicted). No orgies, threesomes, and very little homoerotica."
4,ADDICTED TO PROBLEMS,"In ADICTED, we're confronted with rarely discussed female sexual addition and adultery. What a different subject and a fresh point of view!This is the story of one woman with a serious addiction problem, spilling it all out to her psychiatrist. She delves into her past, her relationship with her husband, and just how she came to be ADDICTED. This book also looks at some of the possible negative outcomes for one involved in adulterous behavior.As I neared the end of ADDICTED, the reading became more intense and I found it harder to put down. Zane writes erotica well, but she may be an even better mystery and suspense writer.Overall, this was a good book. I found some of the dialogue juvenile. The reason for addiction did not seem realistic. Also, while there may have been some times when use of profanity made a point, there were too many times when it was overused."
3,Alright,This book was ok. It had it's good moments but the amount of time spent on describing her childhood was a little drawn out. All in all it was a quick read that wasn't half bad.
3,Addicted -- at first,"I'm a writer by profession, and I'll admit that I was one of those who was ""addicted"" to this novel. I thought the twists and turns were a lot of fun and was willing to overlook the less-than-spectacular writing ability. Ok, some of the stuff was outlandish and unbelievable--but it did keep the pages turning.That said, I tried to read another Zane novel (Sex Chronicles, I believe), then flipped through another and was extremely disappointed. She recycles the same words, phrases and ideas in all of her novels! Even the sex scenes showed zero imagination, and the writing got even worse. Unfortunately, Addicted was her best work. I'd probably recommend it--but I'd also recommend that you go no further than that with Zane."
5,You will truly be Addicted to this!!!!!,"Zane has done it again! This book has everything from drama to romance to erotica. Zane is nothing short of amazing with this book. From the moment I started reading the book, I could not put it down. It is truly a page turner. The end will totally surprise you. If you are looking for something with drama and suspense, you will absolutely love this book!!!!!! :)"
4,What does love have to do with it?,"Addictive delivers the true meaning of undying love, family, friendship, heartache and most of all lessons in being true to thy self. Once opening the book, I could not stop reading. Each page leaves you wanting more. The main character, Zoe, expresses fantasies and fears that many women can relate to in one form or another. The ending leaves one question unanswered, ""What's love got to do with it?"""
5,The best book yat!!!!!!,"I love this book, it was sexy, real, intense, and just off the hook. I recommend that all women, black or white read this book, because Zoe was just out of controll for a minute. I felt everything that she was going through. i not only give 5 stars. i give 15 stars!!!!!!!"
5,Red Lights Please....,"I know this will sound crazy but...This book was so ADDICTING that I prayed for RED TRAFFIC LIGHTS while driving to work, yes, you read correctly.Once I got to work, I sat in the parking lot for ten minutes to finish the book.AWESOME ADDICTION!!"
5,I didn't want it to end :-(,"This was a very good novel, I loved it! There were lots of twists and turns that I wish I could describe (but I don't want to spoil it for any of y'all). My only issue is that for some reason, with my downloaded copy, a lot of the words were typed without spaces in between. For example:""I opened ___thedoor____ myself.""That was the only con of this wonderful book by Zane! =)"
3,an ok book but....,"i wish the book had more to it but it was still a good read, when you get to the middle of the book. all in all i think zane could have done better. i mean, zoe was not addicted to sex, it seemed she was addicted to the adventures of infidelity. at least a happy end came out of all the drama"
5,Addicted to Zane's books..and it will not stop here!lol,Loved this book!It has some twists to it.Believe me it's definitely worth the read..
2,Leave Good Enough Alone!,"I read Addicted in one day, and if I'm on track to reading something in one day that means it was good. And it was up until the end. The story was near perfect until the last couple of chapters. I was so upset. It had enough drama, and twists, and murders without adding more. It just took away from the book big time. I couldn't believe that after having revealed that Zoe almost got raped twice as a child on two seperate occassions that the author would turn around and Actuallyl let her get raped as an adult, and in front of her husband no less. I also found it hard to believe that she was attacked by all those people. There is a such thing as TOO MUCH drama. Some things could have just been left out is all I'm saying. To bad she had to mess with a good thing. Zane, sometimes, you should just leave well enough alone."
4,Incredible book. Loved it.,"After reading the book, I realized that bad reviews ..WAY OFF!!! I found the book to be interesting, exciting, and humourous at times. It defintely had its erotic appeal. It also had a gripping revelation and ending. I liked this book very much. If you are weak in mind and heart, then this book isn't for you to read. If you don't like erotic and somewhat violent material, then I wouldn't recommend it. But, if you like a little excitement in your reading to remind you that you're not reading a text book, then I strongly recommend this book."
5,COULD NOT PUT IT DOWN,"I found myself reading this book inside elevators, at traffic lights, everywhere. Great interesting read!"
5,Awesome,"I am not a reader and this book just blew me away. For those that don't read on a regular basis or read at all, this book will make you want to read and read more. It had my attention from the very beginning. It had me laughing and cying at the same time. I didn't want to put the book down. I can't wait for the next book."
1,Do some research!,"I am kind of shocked that publishers put a book out that the writer has obviously not researched. This is a completely inaccurate portrayal of a sex addict. I agree with another reviewer; it's about a woman whose husband isn't meeting her needs, so she seeks satisfaction elsewhere.Sex addiction is a whole other ballgame.Also, where does Zane get her ideas about therapy?? Therapists don't: give you limitless hours in a session (it's 50 minutes), offer you beverages, act shocked when you tell them your issues, let you wear their gym clothes, give you 24 hours access to their ear, basically act like your girlfriend.Little grammar lesson for both Zane and her slack publisher: it's ""between you and me"" not ""between you and I"". It actually hurts my poor English teacher ears!Yet I read all these rave reader reviews, which kind of freaks me out."
2,Didn't like it,"About 15 years ago I would have really enjoyed this book, but not now. This is my first Zane book and it will probably be my last. I am sure she has a following but I am totally lost at why. I also understand now why men do not bother to date women now especially if they are reading this stuff."
2,An improvement,"I never understood the hype around Zane and her books, she is entertaining at best. Although this book was not nearly as bad as the others, I could see her plot unfolding a mile away. Her charecters have no depth, the story line is shallow and imcomplete, she could have went so many other places with the ending. My friends and family have also read her book, with mixed responses. A good read for people who don't read much more then trashy novels. She is getting better but not what I would consider to be worthy of all the praise she receives."
2,Disappointed,"This book is not worth the hype. I don't know why the author called the book addicted.It doesn't seem like she's addicted to sex she just wants satisfaction.The first part of the book talks about how Zoe met her corny husband, and is extra boring. There is nothing appealing about Zoe to make the reader believe that someone could become obsessed with her.I wanted Zoe and her punk husband to get killed in the end but the author choose a happier ending."
2,How Come Everyone Loves This Book So Much?????,"This is the first novel I've read by Zane. I chose it because I've heard nothing but positive feedback from so many other readers. I must say that I was very disappointed. It starts out pretty good and even midway through, it maintains my level of interest. However towards the latter part of the book, it takes a turn for the worse and becomes incredibly unrealistic. Especially the part about Zoe seeing a psychiatrist on a regular basis, and the psychiatrist divulging information of her sessions with Zoe to Zoe's husband. Whatever happened to Doctor-Patient Confidentiality. Towards the end of the book, it strives to become a murder mystery novel. GIVE ME A BREAK!!!!! As I mentioned this book was a definite dissapointing read for me. Before the ending you'll lose total interest in the characters and the storyline. When I first picked this up, I was anxious in reading other works by Zane. Now I probably won't even waste my time."
1,RIDICULOUS!!!!,"This is the first and LAST book I will ever read by this author. I read it because I've heard so many people talk about this and other books by Zane (never really knowing what they were about). The book was not interesting at all because you already knew that if this woman met someone she was going to sleep with them. It was entirely too predictable, which is not an attention-getter to me. I consider this book to be ""porn on paper""."
2,GIMME A BREAK!!!,"I give this book 2 stars, because I was in it for the ride halfway through until physical violence started to dominate the rest of the book. Seriously, how many times can one woman get beat by the four different male characters in this book? I honestly wished I hadn't finished the book, because I can't buy into the fact that Jason and Zoe's relationship was still going to be intact without one of them being put on antidepressants! Very unrealistic book! Gimme a break!!"
3,Overdramatic,"Although Zane has a way of writing that kept me engulfed with the storyline, the book's ending is a disappointment. I left it with the feeling that all the reading had been in vain. It was at times overdramatic, and the characters very synthetic and forced. I give the book three stars for keeping the pages turning, but must say that the ending was not believable and overly romantic."
1,DISGUSTED!! Those with intelligence stay away!,"This was absolute garbage. I read page after page of the same thing. I thought it would never end. The final thirty pages are in a word... bizarre. The author has a complete lack of intelligent imagination. I would venture to say this is the worst thing I have ever read. The plot,the story...EVERYTHING was done poorly. Unless you enjoy nonsensical trash, do not waste your time."
2,Reads Like A Soap Opera,"After reading the reviews of this book, I am so disappointed in the work itself. Of course, my cue was that the titles of the reviews were ""Da Bomb, Da Bomb Diggity, Off Da Hook"" etc., and that was an indication of the age and intellectual capacity of the audience.Zoe Reynard, the main character was so unbelievable and so unlikable that I found myself reading to find out what ridiculous thing the author would have her do next. ...I read this book because it is for my bookclub. We voted to have a sexy book, but the sex in this book reminds me of highschool. I can't wait to tell the hostess what I think of it."
2,"Trashy, Not Classy or Erotic","I agree with the other readers that this book had just too much going on. Every plot cliche you can think of was in this book. There was no real motivation behind the characters actions, and I can't believe the husband didn't want to have oral sex. There were a lot of sub-plots that did seem like after-thoughts, the affair with Diamond, the friend getting murdered, it was all just too much, and the writing never rose above a junior high level."
2,WHAT????????????????????????????????,"What man out there, would refuse to allow his wife to perform oral sex on him? I don't know of any! I bought this book because of all of the great reviews but was disappointed with Zane's writing style and the overall story.At the end of the book, everything was so conviently rushed into one neat package. Very unrealistic! I finished the book feeling like there was something missing. As far as sexual addiction, what type of research did the author do in preparation for the book? What made Zoe a sex addict? She was more of an adultress than an addict...."
5,That's what it was - Addicted,"I love this book. I read Addicted by candlelight during Hurricane Isabel. This book tells how a woman can become addicted to something without thinking about the consequences until it is too late. Zoe learned that the hard way. She has relations with 3 people outside her marriage that almost distroyed her happy home.When I thought the book was going one way, it did a u-turn and took you any way. It also make you do a double take and say, ""Did I just miss something?"". That's the type of books I like.Zane keep up the good work. I'm addicted to your writing."
2,Where is the talent?,"I can only describe the writing as a cross between a 6-year old being naughty and a male trucker hooked on pornography.Sex scenes are great in a book -- that is, when they are well described. Zane must have some sort of mental problem that she disguises as a talent for writing. Yes, book profits are important but so is integrity.Skip this junk and go with Playboy's Hugh Hefner or ANY male sex/violence fiction writer."
1,1 Star is being generous!,This book is not recommended. Read the reviews before you buy the book. A 1 star is being generous. Where was the addiction? Erotica? Zoe was an adulteress and the so called erotic descriptions was something out of a porn magazine. Leaves nothing to the imagination. Raw!! Her husband not wanting oral sex --- get real. What man would turn that down? ... Don't waste your money. I'm ashamed to give the book away.
4,Addicted by Zane,I really enjoyed this bbok. Zane kept the storyline going and get kept wanting to read more. The story just flowed together. It was as if you were right there with the characters in the book. It seemed so real. You just felt like you knew the characters personally. It is wonderful to be able to find a book that makes you want to know more. At some moments in the book it gets a bit much but I realize that it had to be written that way to get the point across. Great book and I cannot wait for her next one.
2,Unbelievable Characters,"I've heard that Zane has written better books, so I guess I picked the wrong one to read first. This book was amateurish. It was as if Zane thought to herself, ""what drama can I throw in next?"" She needed to decide what kind of book she was going to write. It started as a sex story and turned into a crime story at the last minute. The first half of the book is boring, so I guess she threw in some action to try to save the story. The problem is she didn't develop the criminal characters enough to make their actions believable."
3,Addicted...hm...more like DRAMATIC!,"I thought that this book was okay. It is the first book by Zane that I have ever read. I got into it at first, but then the end was so RIDICULOUSLY dramatic that it just messed up the whole book. Over all it was worth the read i guess, but when you find out the ""true"" natures of the characters at the end, it's just like, ""what the heck happened here?"""
2,Disappointed...,"I read 'Addicted' awaiting to be impressed and stimulated but failed to be given thoses emotions. It was a big let-down for me. The content was all there, however, the manner in which it was expressed was unintelligible. I was expecting something that proved the highlighted credits on the cover and the back of the book to be true. It wasn't a page-turner for me (maybe because of her style of writing) and I was hoping for something more even when I finished the book. I felt the story abandoned adequate information to make this novel as spectacular as the cover emphasized.I will always uplift Black literture but I wouldn't recommend this book for a friend to read because I would feel too ashamed after they finished reading it."
3,Ok dash mat,"Item arrived as scheduled and I would purchase from seller again. This is the second dash mat I have purchased and I do not like this as well as the one I purchased locally at AutoZone, unfortunately they did not have one for the car I now own."
2,Not 4 the Car,"I bought this with the primary intention of in car use. I was worried when I read the car kit instructions and it was noted that a ""rotating sound"" was ""normal"" with use of the car adapter. I have listened to other people's car adapted CD players and never heard such a thing; but as soon as I set mine up in the car I heard the rotating NOISE! Worse yet, the music volume was about a 1 or 2 on a ten scale. Had cleaned the cassette heads on the car and followed the instructions and still it sounded SO BAD that I was so frustrated I really wanted to through it out the window while doing 55. The only reason I can give it 2 stars is that I then tried it with batteries and the headphones and it worked. It didn't sound spectacular but it sounded good enough that I would use it if I wanted to walk around and listen to CD's."
1,bad,When I first bought this product it was great. But after 6months i dropped it from about 1 foot up on a hardwood floor and it shattered. So besides the fact that it is unreliable and cheaply made it it a mediocre player. I then bought a different player ( Sony walkman w/ AM-Fm radio 70$ at amazon) and was amazed that it costed 10$ less.I am dissapointed with Panasonic
5,You Cant Beat a Monitor at this Price,"I just received my monitor today and am pleased with the quality. This monitor is sleak and professional looking. It does not have a lot of gadgets, but what it has is sufficient for the common user. No dead pixels was a very large plus and the DVI-input is a serious bonus for the money. This monitor has to be a top contender for the price range and possibly above. With deals Amazon is having, you would be crazy to pass on this monitor."
1,"Great Screen, but DVI may not work on your Mac","This is an updated review. The first one wasn't so good, as I could not get the monitor to work with an ADC to DVI adapter on my Power Mac. But, I feel that this is a limitation of the video card, not the monitor. The screen works beautifully via VGA, and when I upgrade the video card to DVI, I'm sure it will work even better. (...) Keep in mind, if you are going to use it on a Mac with an ADC port, it may not work with the ADC to DVI adapter. I would upgrade the rating to 4 stars, but don't see how to change that aspect of the review."
3,Slow Delivery,"Im sure this LCD is a great buy, I cant say for certain because i havent gotten mine yet. I ordered mine on Januart 11th and it has not even been shiped yet. Shipping estimate is still 4 days away and the earliest delivery estimate is next month. This is for a 5-9 bussiness day shipping. I dont see how gettin my LCD on feb 2nd (hopefully) after ordering on Jan 11th comes to 5-9 bussiness days. So if you want to be looking at your 200+ dollar purchase in the same month. You should select a faster delivery, but then it wount be such a great buy since you'll have to pay a arm and a leg for shipping."
1,Buyers beware!,"After reading the good reviews here and the cheap price, I decided to buy this monitor. I plugged in the monitor with the DVI cable and turned it on and the picture looked great except when I pressed the menu button a scrambled box came up, all of the menus are scrambled colored boxes!I tried the regular analog cables and its the same. Also when I booted the computer up the next day, half of the screen had my Windows desktop and the other half was black. It took another 20-30 seconds before the full Windows screen loaded, this has never happened before with my old monitor."
3,Great copy of a flawed film,"Horror Express has always suffered from the fact that most available prints were dark and grainy--almost painful to watch!This blu-Ray, however, is crisp and clean--a pleasure to watch.Christopher Lee and Peter Cushing are, as usual, quite good. The story is interesting and internally coherent if a bit confused.The big problem here is Telly Savalas. He seems to be in another film and his entrance and over-the-top performance really hurt the film.Still, it's an entertaining piece of film history--and one I would recommend to any horror fan with a bit of patience and the ability to ignore a high-ham content."
4,What an improvement!,"Just received my copy today. I won't go into the story; you can read the product description for that. I just want to comment on the terrific improvement of the picture quality over past releases.I've owned at least a couple of public domain versions that were washed out, blurred, and grainy. This verion is crisp and clear, with vibrant color and a lot of clean up done. I won't say it's pervect. I saw a couple of spots of imperfection, but they were few and far between. This looked as good as any of the Hammer releases to me.Very happy how this release turned out, especially given what had to be dated materials. Now if someone can just do something with Dr. Terror's House of Horrors."
1,"An exact copy of Magnus, without warning","Brouwer was one of my favorite authors, and I encouraged my daughter to buy this book with her own money. She was disappointed. It was an exact copy of Magnus. At first, I didn't believe it. But, I went to the library and checked. Sadly, it was. No warning. My daughter is not one to waste money. I don't know if I would buy another Brouwer book after this experience."
4,"well,","tonight, I am so tired, and still Thu. then I listen to disk 2, from track 6 to 11. that makes me feel relax and like to try one more day to the weekend."
5,Cant live without it,"My hairdresser raved about the ICON cure and used it on my hair when he was cutting it. I bought it that day and absolutely love it. I have slightly curly hair that can tend to frizz. This conditioner does not weigh it down so it can still curl but it also controls the frizz. The formula is even liquid enough to be poured into travel size spray bottles so I can have it with me when I am traveling. I was so upset when the salon stopped carrying it for some reason. Thankfully it is available online and through Amazon, whom I trust."
5,Excellent Book,"If you want to learn or teach about Logical Paradoxes, this is the book you must raed. I have read many books on this topic, and to my opinion, this book is the best. The paradoxes and their solution (or dissolutions) are presented very clearly."
5,Of Interest to Any Serious Philosopher,"While the topic of the book is paradoxes, this book can easily be used for a 20th century analytic metaphysics course. Sainsbury is easy to understand and lays out the various issues clearly and concisely. My only problem with the book is his last chapter on dialetheism. His exposition is clear, but it is not as accurate as it could be. Anyone reading this chapter would be advised to read some of Priest's original works, and Priest's response to Sainsbury given to the Aristotelian Society."
3,Not Interesting,This book is certainly not worth the price. I have never seen such an interesting topic turned into something so dull. Certainly not what I had expected. Look at a preview online before buying.
3,"It is entertaining; however, it is not Jet Li's best movie.","Jet Li is again Huang Fei Hong in this sequal to the Once Upon a Time in China 1 and 2. Compare to his movies like The Fist of Legend, there are less action. However, it is very entertaining in a way that plot has some funny confusion with Chinese culture and Western Culture. However, I wouldn't say it is better than 1 and 2 or some other movies he made like Saolin Temple series. However, you definately should watch it if you love Jet Li."
3,So-so movie,"I was anxious to watch a trilogy starring Jet Li but was very disappointed in the films. There seemed to be an effort at comedy that just fell flat most of the time and made the characters appear ridiculous at best. The action scenes appeared contrived and nowhere as dramatic as other films like this, such as ""The Rebel"" or ""Onk"". It is a waste of over six hours of time."
5,me love movie,"it a very good movies, especially if u have the new dvd you can acutally see two different movies, everything is the same but some on the dub version are really not on the original one, have fun if you have this movies, i have seen it 10 times since i got is and i still like it."
2,The Lions get in the way,"I have never found a Jet Li movie I haven't truly enjoyed until this one. Like a lot of his movies, there are a lot of martial art sequences and some are terrific. But later on the lion dance competion is hectic. There are lion costumers everywhere and it's hard to tell what is going on. However, it is probably something you won't see in another movie so if you want to see a different kind of martial arts competition, try this but it may not be for everyone."
2,Enough with the Lions!,"I completely understand and genuinely enjoy the Chinese tradition of the lion dance. It is a visually stunning and moving thing to see when done by a capable dancer. But this movie, while building to the climactic end scene, has about 500 lions dancing at the end. All of the lions are trying to defeat all the other lions, and all the while the viewer is left to be confused. Clubfoot was a great addition, but enough with the lions! ..."
3,"Story O,K.--Video Quality Poor.","This film was enjoyable and fun to watch. However, OUTIC2 still remains the best effort in the series for me. I was bitterly disappointed in the video quality. It was poor and some parts looked almost pixelized. They could have done a better job. Audio was okay and the subs were typical."
3,Not as good as 1 and 2,"The action in this installment is choppy; however, Jet Li is a brilliant martial artist and always, always, always, amazing to watch. Part 2 is the superior installment, with Part 1 close behind. By the way, if anyone knows of a VIDEO copy of Part 2, I'd appreciate knowing about it!"
3,"It is entertaining; however, could be his better movie.","It is funny with all the implications between Chinese people and Western custom(Chinese culture and Western culture). There are many action scenes although compared to Jet Li's other movies like Fist of Legend, there are not that much. The last scene is kind of cool. It is funny and entertaning in a way, however, I think it could have been better like the first and second parts of Once upon a time in China."
3,"Good information, or coffee table book.","I picked this book up when I was in a dating drought, and some of the info in here does help. Yes each person is different and all people men or women who read this little book will take something from it. No it is not great liteary art but is something fun to read or a good coffee table book for a single fellow. I have been lucky enough to have this book autographed by 4 of the women who have submitted material. It makes a great keep sake."
5,Wonderful Book!,"I have just discovered Patricia Potter within the last year, and I'm enjoying finding her older books at Book Exchange stores. I was so excited to see Soldier and Rebel on the shelf this month, then I discovered this was reprint of two former published books. The Rebel was a delightful ""feel good"" story. In fact, it would make a marvelous Christmas TV movie. The characters in The Solder were so real. I could hardly put the book down. Thank you, Patricia Potter, for adding so much to my reading enjoyment this year."
2,Dissatisfaction,"I ratec this product as such because while I received it in a timely fashion and the fist hal of the film was enjoyable the remainder was so deteriorated I could not finiish the film. I contacted the seller and they apologized and promised a full refund as they had no other in stock to replace it with.I was disheartend and angry that they did not do as they said they would do,which was to issue a credit on my credit card.."
2,Avoid This Incomplete Edition,The Bloomsbury edition illustrated by Ralph Steadman is ABRIDGED. Do not purchase unless you are buying it for the drawings.
3,review of the Devil's Dictionary,"Sharp-wittewd and pointed ""defitions"" of common day words from the 1800's that still hold humor and truth."
1,Forgetable,"A very forgetable albulm. Non of the energy or inventiveness of 'Cleopatra Grip.' Listened to it several times to see if i was missing something, but just don't think there is much to miss."
4,what I was looking for,"This suit is really nice from the standpoint of it is exactly what it looks like online. The leg openings have elastic around the openings that helps keep deter ""creep up"" the legs. The zipper is in the back, so extra care must be taken while zipping. The material is very smooth and will ""pick"" when in contact with a rough surface like the pool edge. The fabric is very thin so if show-through ""headlights"" bother you, a sports bra underneath will help that and the fact that there is not a lot of bra support. The purple is a really pretty color."
5,This player is AWESOME!,"This player is sooooooo cool. Right when I got it I started testing it. I would run around with it and I would shake it. It never skipped a beat. The one thing that is misleading is that it doesn't have a built in battery pack. You have to buy that separately. Other than that the player is awesome. After I got it and showed all my friends what functions it had, they all wanted one too. Now they're raving to all their parents that it is the best and since they are in sports and stuff it's good for them. I do sports so this player is good for me because it doesn't skip. I would totally recommend it to anyone."
5,Simply Mindblowing,"Ok, All I Have To Say Is Two Words, Simply Mindblowing! I Bought A Panasonic Shockwave SL-SW870 Two Years Ago, And This CD Player Is My Favorite One I Ever Had. I Am Now Shopping Around For A New One Because The Only Problem With This CD Player Is That The Latches On The Sides For Keeping The Lid Closed.. Are Easily Breakable. But, Besides These Things Being Easily Breakable, This CD Player Is Top Of The Line. It Wont Skip With Antishock On, And The VMSS Is Simply Amazing! People Claim The Headphones Are Uncomfortable, But I Dont Have A Problem With Them, And With The VMSS, I Wouldnt Care If They WERE Uncomfortable! Once I Used The VMSS, All Headphones I Tried On Were Nothing Compared To This! This CD Player Is Quite Costly, But It Doesnt Get Any Better."
1,Disappointed,After 4 months of faithful usage of the product my wife has had no tangible results. She continues to use the product with hope.Arnold Sobrian
1,Bad headaches,"Within a few weeks of using this product, I began having headaches. I was not sure this was the issue so I stopped using and within a couple days the headaches ceased. I haven't had anymore headaches since I discontinued using."
3,help with your hair,I purchased this for someone else. I know they tried it but it did not work as expected I'm sorry to say.
1,TOXIC TO CATS,"When Googling this product as a favor to a friend, articles sprung up that Minoxidil is extremely toxic to cats. Even one drop or a cat laying on a pillow where someone who is using Rogaine has been can be fatal. So, though this may be an excellent product for results, buyer beware!"
1,Rip off,"I recently ordered an initial 4-month supply which I received last week. Upon receipt, I opened the box, read the entire insert and decided the product is not for me. Note: I did not open the actual product. There were two boxes in this shipment: one box with a 3-month supply and one box with a 1-month supply. I opened the 1-month supply box.I called Rogaine Customer Care today and was told I am not eligible for a product return, not even a partial return since one of the boxes was opened. Again - the product was not used - I merely read the insert.Turned off by this return policy which is actually pointless."
1,Item expired 7 mos prior to date of sale to me!,"If I could rate it negative stars, I would.Order placed 5/31/08. Advised seller on 6/22/08, that nowhere in listing did it indicate product was expired as of 10/07. No response. Selling expired products is improper and not disclosing this, and then not responding to customer contact, even more improper..."
4,Great guide to spiritual healing,"This is a wonderful guide for the Witch who wants to extend further into the realms of psychic healing. Though in decidedly separtist language, I recommend it to all who wish to bring healing into their lives"
5,excellent for joint health,"recommended by my husband's rheumatologist, and seems to be making it much easier for him to remain active."
3,Wanted the ones that come in a bottle,"I wanted the ones that were in a bottle, but ended up with the ones that are individually packed in blister packs. Very hard for someone with arthritis to open. Product description was not adequate to choose the correct one because none of them say how they are packaged. I have succeeded in getting the ones in the bottle only once in 4 tries."
3,didn't help me,"I tried this product for a few month, and I didn't notice any difference from before or after using it, so I stopped."
3,joint relief?,"The product was recommended to me by my orthopedic surgeon for my swollen and painful finger joints. I took it regularly over a period of several months. I cannot say that I notice a big difference, perhaps the bouts of stinging pain are a little shorter now, but they are still there. All in all, no big difference."
3,ratings,"it didn't really do what i thought it would, this one is not made for me. so i won't use it again."
5,I'm a believer!,"I've tried multiple different brands of glucosamine over the years, and with this one, both my husband and I really noticed a difference! My knees had started aching after horseback riding, and now that has gone away. My husband has chronic back pain, and this has improved that somewhat for him as well. Highly recommend giving this brand a try."
2,DONA Crystalline Glucosamine Sulfate Caplets,"Was disappointed with my most recent purchase. The caplets are all individually wrapped. Previously, it was a bottle with 60 caplets in the bottle. Much easier for dispensing."
3,Meh,I didn't realize this was the powdered version. I'm not a fan. The fake sweetener is unpleasant. I won't make that mistake again.
5,Great product,"According to my rheumatolagist this is the only tested glucosamine that helps. I have been taking it for a while, maybe a year. Seems to keep joints from getting worse."
5,Dona - helpful product!,I bought Dona at amazon.com a month ago. After one week of taking it I felt that my hip joint pain became noticeably less. Now I feel myself much beter.
4,Helped a lot with my aching joints and stiffness,"Dona Crystalline Glucosamine Sulfate Caplets - 60 eaThese have sure made a difference to my aching joints. I didn't have any specific problem, just aches and stiffness. Since I started using these pills, my joints are less stiff after sitting at the computer for an hour and I sleep better because my joints don't start aching at night.Be sure to check with your doctor before using these to make sure you don't have anything that would mean they were a bad idea."
1,Useless,"I have nerve damage. This is supposed to be good for joints. I took a whole bottle as prescribed, and although I do have one very stiff joint, the stuff did nothing for me. Very expensive, no value."
2,It trys hard but never makes it,The cover of the dvd is the best part...but it is not that good...no plot but there are lesbians...that's about it...go rent this one
1,Worse than Death,"This had to be one of the worse films i've ever seen. I couldn't follow the sotry, the lighting was bad, the plot was cofussing...i couldn't even watch the whole thing that's how bad it was...I wouldn't recommend this movie to anyone."
2,The Girl - Not Quite What I Expected,"""The Girl"", unrated and alleged to be ""the sexiest lesbian film of the year"", was at best a major disappointment. Perhaps my expectations were a bit high, but I was looking forward to a film on the same level as ""Bound"". Instead, I got a disjointed artsy film that rambles and bounces around. The plot is very ambivalent and the acting is more just wandering through the scene as opposed to real acting. This is an ""art"" film. Those of you who enjoy this type of film will not be disappointed. Those of us who were expecting a movie with plot, acting, etc. were let down. I viewed this with friends and they all agreed with me."
4,Product image is not accurate,The power adapter is a good price and works fine. My only problem with it is the product image shows that it comes with the AC cord (the cord that is detached on the right side in the photo) but it does not. I saw another customer reported the same issue but I had already ordered it. Luckily I had the original one so I was able to use the adapter but the image should really be changed to accurately represent the product being sold.
3,Good but ...,"Good, but package did not include cable. The package just included adapter.Price was so good. I got this (around $20 including shipping fee)."
4,"A Great Book for a bit History and Art ""sort-of-interested-person""","This is a great book for.......as it said on the book ""Europe History and Art 101."" Nothing too heavy but very informative. It's really nice easy reading....some of the jokes were funny at the beginning but not so much at the end because it's bit boring.... but, if you just like to have a easy read then I strongly recommend it. Enjoy~"
5,Excellent resource,"If you plan to travel Europe this book is a must have, especially if you are interested in history and the museums. It gives tips on how to get tickets without standing in long lines and other tidbits a tourist would not know. I found it to be very time saving and helpful. It definitely will increase my enjoyment while I'm on vacation."
5,Great fun for a quick intro or brush-up,"Let's not even pretend this is a comprehensive book on European history, because I'm sure that wasn't its intention. It IS wonderfully entertaining reading to take along on a trip to Europe. Its light, humorous and informative style was exactly what my teenage daughters needed to enjoy and appreciate the museums and historical places in Europe. I tore out sections and read it to them on the train before arriving at destinations. By putting historic thought and events into a context they could relate to, it got them interested in art and history and made them curious to learn more. I highly recommend this as a travel aid for families or anyone needing an enjoyable brush-up on historic styles and periods."
5,art and travel,"It was a delight as well informative book to read.Very pleasnt, with humor many times and enough historical information to not feel in a classroom but to have the big picture of times and changes of Europe along the years."
5,Rick is the man!,"If you are going to Europe and you want to get the most of your experience on a budget, Rick will help. The owners of hostels and other businesses, that he mentions, actually know him and speak very highly of him! All of his suggestions were realistic, fun, and extremely economical. LADIES listen to his packing advice:)"
4,Great book,"A must have whether or not your travel to Europe. If you do indeed go, read it before and during your trip. Other books are available; however, this one works really well and covers a wide swath or history - and thus interests."
2,Not for the price listed,"This would be a great little frame if it were not for the price listed. I have the one that holds 9 pictures and it's great, but it's also priced much better than this one. For the quality of the frame (plastic, not glass) it really isn't worth this much. But, for a lower price, it'd be a good buy."
3,Lacks depth,"As a fan of mysteries in general, I was dissapointed in the book....The author milked some very known facts, and stretched them into a boring book with little new information. It kind of comes to a stop at the end, without even a splash of Amelia's plane near Howland....Maybe we just don't have enough information to even guess what happened to her....At least the UFO's didn't get into the possible causes of her disappearance.."
2,Amelia Earhart on Fantasy Island?,"I have followed Mr. Gillespie's search for years, and it is, sadly, largely based on wishful thinking instead of facts, such as the fuel capacity of Amelia's Lockheed 10E Electra. Simply put, there is NO WAY it could have reached where he claims it is. The book is an interesting read, and reasonably well done, and there are some opposing viewpoints presented. Factually, though, it is an illusion (one that has paid Mr. Gillespie quite well for a long time). An entertaining read, but not historical research-just a flight of fancy--"
5,Finding Amelia:The true story of the Earhart dissapearance.,"Reading is not my strongest interest,and it goes slow.But I have seen many documentries about Amelia Earhart,and I love them.But I like to keep the book to read it some day!Elisabeth Christine Finne"
4,Finding Amelia,"Ric conducts a very thorough investigation of the radio transmissions during and following Amelia's disappearance as well as the Navy's search for Amelia and Fred.I liked the book, although it was a little dry at times. 'Betty's notebook' is amazing yet heartbreaking evidence. I loved the included CD which contained loads of additional information! I was hoping the book would include a discussion of the latest evidence found on Gardner Island. I found ""Amelia Earhart's shoes"" written by a TIGHAR cohort, Dr. Thomas King, to be another excellent book."
5,a page turner,"I read this literally in one night.....I couldn't put it down...you're right there as ithasca tries to guide the electra to howland. I kept hoping shed make it but of course we all know the ending.The book was well thought out...I even thought the chapters on weather and planning were interesting. It showed how hard communication over a long distance was back then, and also how a variety of factors might have doomed amelia and Fred.Especially fascinating is the chapter 'bettys notebook.'. It'll send chills up your spine! I'm shocked as everyone else that no one up until now would investigate bettys claims.I read the kindle version, so no dvd but many photos.Another good companion piece to this is 'last flight' which her husband published after her death from letters and journals she sent through her flight."
2,Are You Sure!,"Are you sure this is a hands free kit? Hands free kit leads you to believe that it comes with a speaker - it doesn't. For the price I would have thought that it would. It contains a car charger, the ear bud you already have and holder. I give it 2 stars because it is a OEM car charger and ear bud. Don't waste your money. :-{"
5,"Informative, Comprehensive but not drilled-down","This book (2n Edition) is informative in the context of offering a comprehensive overview of various design concept involved in each tier of the J2EE application. If you are trying to envision what a J2EE platform can do for you, this is a good book to grab. While it provides some insight on design consideration, however, it defers the readers to seek for J2EE vendor implementation rather than offering a solution. Nevertheless, it does point out some advantage/disadvantage or the trade-off associated with choosing different implementation. It also provides some coverage on design patterns, framework (struts), security, transaction and state management ...or stateful EJB session bean. If you are involved in a J2EE project, this book will serve as a good reference for high-level design concept which puts together all J2EE related knowledge that you might have learned from elsewhere."

3,"Not bad, but very simplistic","I actually enjoyed reading the book, but I should say that in my opinion, the views were very simplistic. It is a relatively short book with many messages, which the author often illustrates by example. I personally thought some deserved a more in depth discussion. However, one could argue that was the point - to stay in line with his baseball metaphors. In any case, I don't know if I would recommend this book, but it's not a bad read. I've certainly read worse parenting books..."
5,Lessons that last all season,"Jack Petrash hit a home run with this book. I run a national fathering nonprofit, and this is one of my 3 favorite books on fathering -- real, simple, clear, short and to the most essential of points about being a good dad. That is, be intentional. Pay attention to what you do and say, and open yourself up to the passion of the best job a man can ever have -- father."
3,Good bargen for the money.,I have had my Hisense TA42P40M for about 4 years now. Considering it is a 480p the picture quality is great. The coloring on the TV is fine. Never had any problems with it. The sound is great too.I would have to say my only complaint with this TV is that the remote for my cable box controls the TV volume and that there is no HDMI connection on it. Other then that this has been a great TV.
5,RECORDED IN THE 60's THIS ALBUM PROVED WHY JIMMY SMITH WOULD GO ON TO BIGGER AND BETTER THINGS,"The album kicks off with a funky version of ""When Johnny Comes Marching Home"", other stand outs cuts include: ""Sonnymoon For Two"", ""Mack The Knife"". The collection features Two (2) Bonus Tracks: ""If I Should Lose You"" & ""When Lights Are Low"", which gives you even more reasons to get rid of your old 'Dead Wax'."
5,Tools for accessing 'the all that is of us',"Getting in touch with ourselves can be difficult and I believe for many of us, the hardest form of communication. Amanda's very special book gives us the tools to get help from 'the all that is of us', to link back up with our higher aspects. Here is a way of accessing and communicating with that part of us in the time light continuum, the higher dimensional worlds. The tools help us to connect with those Beings of Love who surround us and are here to be of service to us, for our spiritual evolvement as well as theirs. I have found it easy to take these new tools and personalize them to suit my unique and special needs without, I feel, losing the power and intent of what Amanda and the Masters have gifted me. I can feel my ""drop of water' is joining the 'Ocean' a lot clearer since picking up this book."
3,The Lightworkers Companion,"Not a 'light"" read. If you are into exploring higher levels of spirituality, then you would probably find this of interest. There are some practical meditations and other bits of advice that spiritual people might find of interest, but I would not describe it as ""unputdownable""."
4,"Captures the band in time, allows us to visit as we please !","Having had the opportunity to check out this remarkable band during several stages of it's unending metamorphosis, I am well aware of what a Nazareth show sounds like. I am equally aware of what a Nazareth show feels like. This outstanding collection has somehow managed to capture both ! The sound quality is in a word ... impeccable ! The interaction between band and crowd is as it should be. The reason for my rating being four stars out of five is.. This live disc is so utterly fantastic, that it should have been a double or triple disc release. I've left one star open for ""Snaz 2""."
3,I wasn't too impressed,"I bought this book thinking it had a lot of great craft ideas, but I was wrong. A lot of the crafts and ideas are too eccentric and too nouveau for my tastes. For example, I wouldn't consider making tassels as gifts or even to sell and I thought this craft was a bit eccentric. Then again I realize there are some who are into this type of craft, but realistically I don't think many of the crafts would sell well in an average bazaar or craft sale. Maybe for a gallery, but not for the normal craft sale afficianado.There are some good ideas, like painting glassware, but there just too many gallery-type crafts in this book. I was sorely disappointed and I returned this book.Just be ready for gallery-type crafts."
5,Crafts to make and sell,"This is the BEST craft book I have found. It really has nice things to make that are fast and cheap to make, and that really bring in the PROFIT!"
3,What I Saw at the Revolution: A Political Life in the Reagan,Very interesting about the inside track of the administration. I felt that the author was very unhappy and didn't portray her time well at the White House.
2,"Well written and engaging, but other than that...","...other than that, this book is absolute drivel. From the moment we are assured that our part in the Vietnam War was 'basically good' right through to the end, Noonan seems to prefer disregarding history or any serious examination of the left. This book is a good portrait of how a conservative's mind works (if you're interested in such a thing, which you probably shouldn't be)"
5,lightness of being conservative,"Peggy identifies the conservative that I am, the one who is drawn into an hour-long conversation with a building custodian and finds himself richer for it, who sees something alive in a bag in the gutter and would never think to kick it, whose impulse is to write a personal letter encouraging a high school valedictorian who has been restrained from sharing her faith at her commencement ceremony, who apologizes to the Secret Service agent for sneaking in to watch the President give a speech that she wrote, who daydreams about her moment with Gorbachev as a chance to say, ""So when are you going to stop throwing innocent people into the gulags?"", who doesn't mind drawing a picture of herself nose pointing at the ceiling and snoring during a van ride on a Presidential campaign. I wish she were my cousin so we would have a natural reason to visit every so often and share the joy and lightness of our conservatism."
5,A delightful account of the Reagan era,"Peggy Noonan's autobiography of her years in the Reagan White House is simply a wonderful book. She has an engaging style, penetrating insight, and charming humor. Admittedly conservative, she defends her point-of-view with eloquence and logic. But this must be expected. She was a gifted speech writer. Reagan and Bush senior were fortunate to have the use of her talents. And now we have her account as a valuable historical record. Read it! You will enjoy this book. Highly recommended."
4,No Body49,Style Monsters is not as good as Farewell Street but still it's a great album. A must buy if you like a cool mellow sound.
4,A Pleasant Collection.,"This post-humous collection of Gram Parsons recordings was originally released in 1976 - 3 years after his death. 9 tracks are Flying Burrito Brothers recordings from early 1970 and 3 tracks were recorded during the ""Grievous Angel"" sessions. The 3 later tracks are duets with Emmylou Harris.There are no Parsons originals included. The Burritos were planning to record a whole album of ""pure and honest"" country music. Most tracks are pleasant, but nothing extraordinary.Parsons had a good voice for country music, but this collection does not give the answer to how he could become a legend in country-rock. There are some fine vocal harmonies with Chris Hilmann and with Emmylou Harris things rarely go completely wrong.Of the Burrito songs ""Sing Me Back Home"", ""Your Angel Steps Out of Heaven"" and ""Dim Lights"" are really good, and ""The Angels Rejoiced Last Night"" with Harris is the highlight of the album."
2,Moderate appetizer,"2 1/2Slightly intriguing mistake of a first album to grab when becoming acquainted with the pioneering country-rockers, this compilation only hints at mellow innovations made more obvious on bigger releases."
4,Collectable Gram,"This comprises stand-out tracks of country standards Gram Parsons made with the Burritos shortly before he left the band, and three fantastic previously unreleased duets with Emmylou Harris which were inexplicably left off his wonderful second solo album, Grievous Angel, including the definitive version of Sleepless Nights. You need to have these"
4,Outstanding,"Don't understand why this collection has been overlooked to such an extent through the years. Because GP wasn't around to approve? The time-space between the 9 Burritos recordings and 3 GP/E.Harris recordings was only a couple of years. The result is that the tracks fuse with no difficulty. One aspect of this album is the perfect sequencing. Somebody put thought into that--for which we should be grateful. Otherwise, as others have said, the three GP-EH are breathtaking. (Opening, closing, and smack in the middle of the album) The Burritos tracks are solid, with better bass parts than the two previous Burritos albums. Serious country. Perhaps one reason that folks don't get more excited by this collection is the absence of a GP original song. No matter...it is what it is...top-shelf country with Gram's genius for singing."
3,Tinny Speakers,"Don't buy this CD player thinking you'll like listening to your music on it's built-in speakers. You won't! They are incredibly tinny. However, the headphones that come with it have a nice sound, altho they are somewhat awkward to wear since they want to slip forward if you try to wear them with the headset at the top of your head. You'll need to slide the headset toward the back of your head to fix this problem, but they fit comfortably positioned like that. Except for the built-in speakers, this is a very nice portable CD player. It's lightweight and easy to use."
4,FUN CD PLAYER,"Now, I can listen to my CDs anywhere I want without having to use earphones! Obviously, I can't compare the sound to my stereo system or a Bose. But why would I? The speakers are small. What else should I expect? The price is high compared to other compact CD players or big boom boxes (I think because this model is made in Japan). So, basically, I'm paying for convenience. Ok, that's it..."
5,REALLY GOOD PLAYER!,"When i relized i needed i new discman, i new i needed a good one. i had 160 dollars to use and i only spent 100, and it was worth it. This discman is small and has REALLY good sound."
1,Don't buy it - too fragile,My daughter purchased a Panasonic SL-SX289V. Withina couple of weeks it was busted. It fell onto alinoleum floor from a height of 2.5 ft and was ruined.The hinge/latch mechanism was shattered.A few bumps are inherent in the life of a portableelectronics gadget of any kind. Clearly Panasonicdidn't do their homework in designing their CD players.
4,I have a question about this pro. not ans. on review,I walk and like to play my cd's. Can you play this while walking. I have made a shoulder keeper for the purpose of placing a cd player in it when I walk. Will the motion of walking interfer w/this player? Please reply. Ann Carter-Combee
3,"Another good mystery, with a tragic ending..","Harold Adams's ""The man who met the Train"" is a bit of a step back from ""Barbed Wire Noose"", but is still a good book. Carl Wilcox comes across a car wreck in Tocqueville and helps to rescue a little girl named Alma. The accident claimed the life of the mother, whose husband was mysteriously run over by a train only a few years before. Soon, Wilcox is hired by two bitter rivals in order to find the truth behind both deaths, and he finds that the accident wasn't an accident at all, and greed and envy are motives for murder. The story climaxes with bloodshed and tragedy."
5,Salute the General,F*%#ing Awsome album as usual Mike Patton dosn't fail to impress with this releas some realy great songs and some great sampling and scratching from the Xecutioner gang. A lot of good break beat stuff the only complaint is that the tracks are not long enough!!! we could use some extended remixes from this album. would have to rate highly for Pattons side project stuff
3,Take away Patton,"This album is take away Patton:Fast with just a little bit of taste...PittyTry ""Lovage, music ..."" instead"
5,"haven't heard this yet, but...","...x-ecutioners are not from oakland(i can see how the mistake could be made, being that there is a very big turntablism scence out there). they hail from nyc."
3,"Very good sonics, but the performance is maybe overrated.","The sonics are very good. Still, to my ears, at least, the ensemble playing sounds pretty weak, and the balances & phrasing seem out of kilter, too. Honestly, it sounds under-rehearsed to me. If your interest here, like mine, is mainly in the Holst suites, I would suggest ""Evolution"" by Lowell Graham & The USAF Band.Evolution / United States Air Force Band / Holst Mennin Hanson Nelhybel Mays WelcherTheir playing of the Holst pieces blows the Cleveland players out of the water. The sound quality is great, too."
5,Amazing overview of the experiences of women psychiatric survivors.,"This book really helped me when I was struggling to figure out what psychiatric institutionalization had done to me, and how to adjust to the outside world afterwards. It put my experiences into a broader perspective so that I understood that even experiences I had previously thought private were commonplace in the psychiatric system. The writing ranges from poetry to prose, from first-person accounts of the psychiatric system to analyses of how the system itself operates in a broader sense, and everything in between. There is an interesting account of how the ideas, language, and power structures of psychotherapy invaded and weakened the women's liberation movement, alongside poetry that starkly illuminates the experiences of people who still remain, forgotten, possibly by now dead, in the system. This book covers a lot of ground and does it well."
2,Not really my thing,"Interesting, but just something I had to read for a class. Some of the recollections are superb, while other went straight over my head."
3,Sizing Incorrect,"The poster itself is alright for under $3. Shipping was fast, the tube was sturdy and no damage occurred. The paper is a little on the thin side, but it went into a poster frame so it's not a big deal.The color of the image is not as shown above. The colors in the actual poster are a lot more muddied and not nearly as vibrant as shown in the example, but it will be going in a brightly (fluorescent) lit office so they might pop a little more there.What irritates me the most about this, and why I'm not giving it 4 stars: their dimensions are way off. I own a nice metal frame with one of those motivational posters in it and I was searching for a poster in the 24""x30"" size. The size was main reason for buying this, the content was far less important. Unfortunately I got it home and this is definitely a 24""x36"" poster. NOT 24""x30"" as listed. Luckily I had a cheap poster frame with a poster that was more easily trimmed down (no border) otherwise I would have had to buy that as well."
3,Keyborad works well.. The mouse replacement sucks..,"I like the keyboard, but the little joystick mouse replacement is really difficult to use. You need to push down on it, but only the perfect amount, too much and it doesn't work."
4,good option for home theater use,"i wanted a keyboard to use w/ my media center pc, which is hooked up to my tv in my living room. like others mentioned, the mouse pointer device does not work that well. but if you change the mouse setting in the control panel to the slowest or second slowest setting you will find it is easier to navigate.for just sitting on your couch and mostly using media center or doing light computing this is fine. the mce remote functions on the keyboard are very handy, the keyboard works great, and the mouse is pasable. but if you are trying to do any kind of activity that requires extensive use of the mouse then this will definitely drive you crazy."
1,Horrible keyboard,"This kb/mouse combo is horrible and underdeveloped. The mouse button gets stuck, the IR connection is very weak and the mouse knob is extremely sluggish and unusable. I do not recommend this keyboard as you will be disappointed."
2,Not so much,"The product is advertised for Windows XP Media Center Edition, but works fine for Vista Home.Despite any advantages this wireless keyboard has over wired versions, it fails when it comes to the mouse functions. Remember when you used the touch button on the center of you laptop keyboard the first time and thought, ""That's awkward"" but soon enough you got used to it?Well, this one you won't get used to. Please, Microsoft, make one with a touchpad."
3,Needs More Lit Keys,"Agree with previous comments regarding pointer being difficult to use and getting better with more use/experience. Other than that, I'd recommend an option to have ALL keys lit instead of just the keys to either side of the normal keyboard. Would be a drain on battery life, but would make it much easier to find certain keys in the dark (e.g. Backspace, Delete, etc.)."
2,Not Recommended,"I wound up returning this. There are better Media Center options out there (See Gyration stuff). Here are my gripes:- Requires Media Center IR receiver - not included- Pointing nub is very difficult to use - not useless, but really not good- Line of sight needed - this is obvious, but there are options that don't require line of sightOverall, the difficulty using the nub was the deal breaker for me."
3,It doesn't come with a receiver!,"The keyboard is nice, but unfortunately I didn't see anything in the online information regarding it not coming with a receiver. I now have to either return it or purchase the receiver to connect to the PC"
5,Microsoft MCE IR keyboard,"- Easy to get it working- Package from Amazon was new and perfect- Great functionality (sleep, dvd menu, MCE menu), volume, channel changeIt is of course directional being IR. I'm using it with Vista Home Premium edition and both this and my IR remote seems to get stuck every once in a while - for instance if you are doing down menu it keeps going down and does not stop. Only reboot fixes that."
3,OK,I was a little disappointed. Mouse is weak. It's convenient. Feels pretty good in your hands. At worst it's a nice keyboard. I'll probably get my money's worth. I don't expect it's the best of its kind.
4,"Good Keyboard, OK Mouse, Works with more than Windows MCE","I was looking for a wireless keyboard with built in mouse for my HTPC. There were a ton of brands I hadn't heard of with mixed reviews and most were more than double the price of this keyboard. My HTPC has Windows XP Pro with a Hauppauge WinTV-HVR-2250 Media Center Kit so I wasn't even sure the keyboard would be compatible but thought it would be worth a shot. The keyboard worked perfectly right out of the box with the existing IR receiver that came with the Hauppauge kit.The mouse replacement isn't a strong point but if you slow down the cursor speed, it isn't that hard to get used to. If you have your cursor speed at its max, you're not going to have a good time. If the mouse was a trackball, this product would get 5 stars from me."
2,"Nice Keyboard, But...","buyer beware, as other's have mentioned already, this keyboard does not ship with the IR receiver, the IR receiver only comes with the MS Media Center remote control. And this is an IR based setup, meaning you have to be able to point the Keyboard at the receiver or it doesn't work.At the time of my initial purchase, I did not have the MC remote; so I had to buy that as well (extra $34.00+shipping).At the time of my purchase, I had read the reviews about the joystick/mouse button being ""stiff"" and it would loosen up after a while, but on the board I purchased this never happened, as such this was unuseable for me and I had to find a wireless keyboard that had a trackball instead.My next purchase was for this keyboard:""https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000JJM7S0/ref=oss_T15_product""its radio based and has a trackball, this has been a dream since I installed it. Granted it doesn't have the nifty Media Center buttons, but that's fine; this is a simple wireless board that works."
3,"Keyboard good, Mouse bad","The keyboard portion works great, but the mouse leaves a lot to be desired. The keyboard has a good feel and operates quite far from the receiver. The mouse is a pressure sensitive button that goes from no motion to jumping a significant distance making it hard to select things on the screen. Even with practice it is almost unusable."
3,Missing critical componant,"Something I missed from the description (although not others comments - wish I'd read them) is that this keyboard DOES NOT INCLUDE AN IR RECEIVER! As a result, it only works with computers that shipped with windows XP media center edition and included a specific IR receiver. Only consider this keyboard if that description fits your computer.Pity, as it is well built, looks nice. Something that critical should really be in the product description though."
2,Only half right...,"Cheers to the the keyboard, Boooo to the pointer (mouse). I had a very old LiteOn wireless keyboard w/ integrated pointer and it worked great until someone broke it a few weeks ago. I saw Microsoft's new iteration of the same except with the great MCE funtionality. I wondered what more could anyone want for a home entertainment center with an integrated MCE computer? The new MCE keyboard/pointer would be perfect! Boy, was I WRONG. The pointer on this thing is horrid. I have never seen any pointing device worse than this thing. Not only is it hard to control but mine will only engage for about 1 second before stopping. I have to release pressure and try again to make it move some more. It takes about 3 attempts to get it across the screen. There may be some other hardware conflict or something, but it still fails miserably in ease of use."
1,MISSING IR RECIEVER,"While I'm sure this MCE Keyboard is awesome, Its a damn paperweight if you do not already own an IR Reciever as it does not come with one. Essentially I bought a cool looking showpiece because Amazon neglects to even mention this fact. It is still my fault for not checking reviews.Buyer Beware."
1,ignores most of your keystrokes,"I bought one of these a few years ago -- it was close to useless, as if you type faster than about 1 keystroke per second, it drops keystrokes. If you type ""amazon"", it's likely to come out as ""an"" or maybe ""aao"" if you're really lucky.Since it failed in the modest task that was its charge -- I mean, come on, how do you use a keyboard on which you can't type? -- I rate this as the worst keyboard I've ever used."
1,Support Nightmare; advertised as Vista compatible.,"I have a new HP HTPC; loaded and runs flawlessly. I purchased the keyboard as the icing on the cake; but it didn't work. The seller stated it would work with Vista 32--as did Microsoft; but after days of searching the web I cannot find a driver update that enables this functionality. Windows Update shows there are no available updates; but it just will not work. A real shame; as the keyboard has a great advertised range and is aesthetically, very pleasing.I am very disappointed!"
2,"Great product design/layout, horrible functionality","As mentioned, the layout of the keyboard is great... It's comfortable, has most the shortcut's I'd want, however it's designed for Media Center, and Media Center only. No IE/Internet shortcuts are present, which in my opinion is a bad design. Everyone that has a Media Center PC, also has Windows XP ""professional"", which could use those short-cuts.My largest gripe about this product is the mouse. Why Microsoft makes you press downward, in addition to the direction of the mouse is beyond me. We've had it about a month now, and despite other users saying it gets better with time, ours has not. I was expecting a laptop-like fingermouse, and that's not what this keyboard has."
2,Nice but I found it hard to type,"I like the keyboard but find I am always hitting the wrong keys when typing. I am using my old keyboard now and am much happier. If anyone wants to buy this one, $15 plus shipping."
2,Haven't Even used it YET!,"Simply put, I thought the keyboard was backlit. I should have read closely...only the media keys are. WHATS THE POINT? Backlit = dark room...duh! Then as it shows up with this minimal disappointment, I find that there is no IR receiver with it... what a rip off! I will probably return it even though people say the keyboard is great, I'd rather go bluetooth. DIRTY POOL."
2,Not worth it,The first week I thought I was the problem and continued to work with it but it hasn't gotten any easier to use or any more reliable. Very rarely does it pickup all of what I'm typing whether it's a web address or an email. Half thte time the arrow buttons work to navigate through the Windows Media menus and the other half it's the specific buttons you're supposed to use. Don't waste your money.
2,Not Quite Right,"Keyboard works just fine, it's durable and easy to type. I had no problems with this part. The ""moue"" however is horrible. Like another reviewer stated, you have to push down on the button to get it to move, and mine was extremely stiff and eventually hurt my thumb after just a short while of casual usage. It is finicky, does not respond well, is not even remotely accurate and is just plain bad design. I would recommend a bluetooth mouse to go with this keyboard and skip its mouse entirely. Everything else worked great and was configured very quickly."
1,No Consistency of Use,I don't like this product. The keyboard function did not work consistency. The pointer did not work.
1,Didn't Work with Standard Media Center IR Reciever,"I had bought a third party IR Media Center remote, and thought that this keyboard would work with its USB IR receiver. It didn't. Nowhere does the manual I got state that it needs a specific type of receiver, nor does the seller state this in the description.Unit was also supposed to come with batteries. It did not.Assuming I can't find a usable receiver on eBay, I'm gonna RMA this.Its too bad. It would be really nice if I could get a compatible IR receiver. It seems be have decent construction, except for the mouse. It does work, and I can use it to turn my TV on and off. So I can at least give it good marks for consistency - it consistently works to turn my TV on and off, and consistently does not work with my computer.If you don't already have an IR receiver that you know is compatible with this keyboard, stay away."
2,Erratic and disappointing,"I have used this for about 8 months on my Windows Media PC in my home theater. It constantly drops the first letter when I start typing, as well as erratically missing other letters while typing, the mouse is difficult to use. I am only 7 feet from the IR sensor in clear line of sight. I've tried different batteries, shading the room, but this keyboard continues to frustrate. Maybe I got a bad one but I suspect the ancient IR interface is the problem.I decided having a Green Button on the keyboard isn't necessary as I can map the button on another keyboard. So I just bought a 2.4ghz HP Elite wireless keyboard and Microsoft wireless 4000 mouse to replace it. The difference is astonishing...not sure why I struggled with this old keyboard for so long."
1,Buy it only if you already have microsoft IR receiver,"BEWARE..This product ships with no IR receiver. I have had this remote keyboard for almost 2-3 weeks and unable to find a compatible IR receiver in local stores. No one carries them anymore. Btw, it does not work with IR receivers that come bundled with other name-brand MCE remotes. The only compatible IR6 receiver(A9O-00007) I could find was on ebay for >$20. If you are buying this for keyboard, you are better off buying wireless(2.4Ghz) keyboard. If you are looking for remote + keyboard, tough luck in finding a IR receiver that works. In this day and age, It believe it should ONLY be shipped with a Receiver. Amazon should clearly note this on their product description. For me, it is nice product but useless. I am returning it."
1,not complete!!!,DOES NOT COME WITH IR RECEIVER. its a paperweight without it. why no one else mentioned this in reviews before I have no idea. weak sauce.
3,Does not come with the receiver!,"Buyer beware, this is the keyboard only. I bought this thinking that I could have the best of all worlds for my home built MCE machine: a wireless keyboard, mouse and remote control all in one.However, you must have a Media Center machine with the IR Receiver. It doesn't come in the box, although this is not listed anywhere on the Amazon site (it is on the side panel of the box). Seemes pretty nice other wise, however I can't tell for sure since I don't have the IR on my machine. Looks like I have to return it or buy the remote control too. Also note, that according to some of the reviews on other computer sites that this keyboard won't work outside of Windows MCE, eg. you can't enter the bios, it won't work on regular Windows XP, etc."
3,"Decent addition to HTPC, but flaws spoil the fun","The good: The keyboard is comfortable, the layout is really smart for right-handers, the IR is strong so I've found transmission to be reliable.The bad: Mouse control is very weird and hard to master. Also, there's a keylock switch which disables the keys (good for houses with kids). But the first manufacturing runs have a flaw which loses the ""learned"" commands for TV power and volume control when the keylock is enabled for too long (about an hour on mine). I've exchanged it already, but the new system Amazon sent has the same problem as the first. If I can't get Amazon or Microsoft to supply a newer model without the flaw, I'll return it and go to a brick-n-mortar so I can verify the part number before I purchase it. Part numbers ending in -001 are flawed, and part numbers ending in -002 are fixed, according to online discussion posts."
4,Business Owner,"The arrived in working order, installed easily as a replacement. Only thing that could be better is the spray pattern was not evenly formed. It is an adequate replacement for old broken hose."
5,"Finally, you get days that are more than 24 hours long!","This book was great for me. The method described to reduce the amount of sleep you need may not work for everyone, but I definitely had great results with it. For three years (until I got into my hectic college schedule) I slept exactly 5-and-a-half hours per night, by the book's method, and I had more energy and was more productive than ever. When I get back to having a normal schedule, I am going to start using this book's method again.Be aware however, that the change doesn't happen over night. It took me almost a year to get down from 8.5 hours of sleep to 5.5 per night. You also need to practice a pretty rigidly defined lifestyle (with a set bed-time and no snoozing the alarm clock) to have any success."
4,Fun read for fans,I am a Stephen King fan and I heard about this book a couple of weeks ago even though it was published some years back. I ordered it from Amazon and got it quickly. I sat down and read the whole thing in one afternoon. It was very funny and entertaining - sort of like a tame rock & roll biography where the band members are geezers instead of twenty-somethings. It consists of short chapters by each band member describing how they were recruited into the band and the adventures they had on the mini-tour. I like the book.
3,Poor sound,This music has always held it's own and stood the test of time.The problem is the very poor sound makes it very hard to listen to.
4,Web of Thrills,"Four stars, but only because of the spiders; I HATE spiders. Nevertheless, I managed to finish WEB OF LIES because I had to. I couldn't quit reading the well-crafted thriller/whodunit. For this piece of verbal virtuosity to so grip me is remarkable, considering my maleness. Women typically write for women, right? With a central spiritual theme, and Collins applying romantic and relational colors with a palette knife, my Y chromosome might well have put me to sleep. On the contrary, WEB OF LIES kept me reading late at night, and I challenge any male to read it and honestly report being bored. Ain't gonna happen!"
4,Hidden Faces Series by Brandilyn Collins,"I liked the books very much. They were suspenseful and kept you guessing until the end. However, the series tended to get a little preachy toward the end."
5,Lovely!,"This is the best foundation I have ever tried. I have a tendency to get red skin, which Youngblood eliminates completely without looking unnatural. The first time I applied it I thought it made my pores show, but I realised it was just a matter of working it into the skin correctly with the right Youngblood brush. Doing so, my skin appears flawless. Highly recommended!"
2,not enough coverage,"When I put this makeup on it covered nothing, and made my pores look larger. The pressed power foundation is much better"
4,Advertising incomplete,"I ordered this because I thought it was the same thing I saw in a store. Since Amazon didn't publish a picture I was taking a gamble. It turned out NOT to be the same thing, which was disappointing. The item that did show up is very nice, but not what I had hoped it would be."
5,Mangione's BEST,If I could give this CD a higher rating I would! This album has been through my whole life with me -- first on LP (I have Papa Mangione's Autograph on it when Chuck appeared in Pocatello Idaho) I can't tell you how happy I was when I knew it was re-released on CD!Can we give this one a 10 Star Rating!
5,Mangione's best music live with an orchestra.,"Like many of the other reviewers, I bought the album in the early 1980's, played it day and night, and have been waiting ever since for its release on CD. Not only is the music great, but the orchestral arrangements (especially the horns and strings) add a lot, especially on ""Land of Make Believe"", ""Chase the Clouds Away"", and ""Bellavia.""The performances are top notch, and when you close your eyes you can feel the musical energy from the artists and the audience on that magical evening right in your living room.A friend of my brother-in-law found this recording in Germany and brought several sets back to Hawaii. I borrowed the CD and found that it brings back the magic that the album had for me.Amazon.com, you can add me to the wait list for this CD!"
5,amazon.com,I'm looking for someone who had in his collection any Cd of Chuck Mangione Alive especially Chuck Mangione at Hollywood Bowl or Evening Of Magic. I'm a great fan of Chuck Mangione for 25 years. Or where can I get anyone? Thanks.
5,it is my comfort in sad times and my pall in good times,"When I play this album, I dont have the cd (yet), I feel as if i have been there. That beautifull sound of chuck's hornet and that great band makes this my all time favourite album."
5,Mangione is one of the true greats!,"I have been a Mangione fan as long as I can remember! Being a Trumpet player for 20 years, I have never hard such a rich,dark and beautiful tone from a flugelhorn. Live at Hollywood Bowl has to be one of his best recordings. His quartet is one of the best ever put together! I think the live version of Hill Where The Lord Hides is one of the best I have heard. Not to mention Land of Make Believe and Children of Sanchez. It is a recording I will always have in my collection and one I'll always have next to any system I can listen to music on!!!!"
5,finally it's available on cd,"I got the vinyl version in from the '80 's and I love the music. I did all I can to get the vinyl copied to cd, but it was almost impossible without spending a lot of money. Now this concert is available on CD and I am verry happy. I played Children of Sanchez myself in a Big Band and it is one of the greatest tunes I have ever heard, but everyone should listen a couple of times to the solos in Main Squeeze, Feels So Good or Love The Feelin'. Enjoy it....."
5,The Egyptian mind uncovered,"If you only read one book about ancient Egypt this is it. The morals, the thoughts, the heart of the ancients are here on display. It is a book published long ago but the content is as fresh as if it were published today. If you are interested in Egyptian thought and the incredible civilization and culture they produced, this is a book that must be read."
5,TOPNOTCH PLAYER WITH THE WORKS!,"Wow! This Panasonic CD player is superb in every way. The sound quality is excellent,and with three sound equalizers,you can customize the right tones for each specific disc you play. The anti-skip technology is solid, in fact you'd probably have to jump up and down on it to make it skip! Even the headphones are up to the quality of the player. The styling is sleek and thin, and the controls are nicely placed, making it easy to operate.The remote control is a great bonus to this set, allowing you to operate the main controls while jogging or walking without having to fumble for the player itself. This is one grand CD player. Every need of a personal CD player has been addressed. Panasonic really knows how to make great audio products!"
1,disagree with other reviewers,"I am returning this unit. The volume was not very loud, it skipped even with the a-shock on, the hand remote bounces around your chest when you run, and it comes with too many attachments and buttons that add complexity but little value. I went to Best Buy to buy another headset but after listening to several units ended up buying a sony sport model that u can hold in your hand. Same price, much better skip protection, much louder, more sturdy and water-resistant. If your going to be jogging I would not buy the Panasonic as it is fragile in comparison."
1,Choppy and difficult to read,I found Satisfaction choppy and difficult to read. The jumping back and forth from 1994 and 2004 was distracting. I finally read all of the 2004 segments just to get them out of the way so I could concentrate on the story line which in itself was vague.
3,confusing,"This book was alright, except I don't know why the author chose to keep going back and forth between 1994 and 2004. It got confusing after a while because it was done so abruptly.By the end of the book, I felt it was basically about 3 guys and 3 (sleazy) sisters that end up sleeping and swapping boyfriends around, before settling down. Eeww."
2,disappointing,I love Gail Davies voice and many of her songs but was very disappointed in this DVD. Not much fun.
5,"Gail Davies, one of the great country vocalist","Gail Davies has one of the greatest voices of all the female vocalist.A great talent, we need to hear more from her."
2,Each Album Gets Worse!,"There are only three decent cuts on the Fancy Dancer album:3. You Make Me Feel So Good;5. Mestizo Eyes; and6. Sweeter Than Sugar.Though the cuts are decent, they are little more than urban elevator music. The rest is garbage/filler. Save your money and download the very few decent cuts."
4,Fixing dissatisfaction by finding personal meaning.,This is a buoyant self-help book which seeks to help the over-stressed individual lost in a consumer culture. The goal is finding meaning and setting priorities in order to gain personal happiness. Includes lots of quotes from real people and many thoughtful questions about honesty and feelings.
5,A great Player,"I got this CD player for christmas and it is exactly what I could want! The radio is excellent quality and you can program many shortcut buttons for your fav. radio stations. The anti-skip is top of the line, it's not quite as good as the Sony G-protection but you won't notice the difference unless you beat the heck out of the player.( The only time realisticly that it would skip with the anti-shock on is if you fell down 50 stories of stairs. Putting the batteries in really isn't a problem and they're quite easy to get out. I recommend buying some rechargable batteries to save you some money and it comes with an adapter which is nice if your close to and outlet and your going to be there a while so it'll save your batteries.The head phones are nice they hurt my ears for about a day but your ears get used to it and then it's fine.I recommend this player over the sony sport or groove it is just more rugged and will last you much longer."
1,sending it back,"in the past 6 - 7 years I have only bought two panasonics. i've loved them since they've lasted all sorts of abuse and the vmss headphones rock. so i figured i'd go for another panasonic but this one is a flop. i don't care how good the rest of the cd player is and what it does. if i don't get good sound, it's useless to me. and the headphones that come with this unit are U S E L E S S. i'm sending it back and really bummed to see that panasonic thinks that this style of headphones, the ones that slip into your ear, work for anyone. i have yet to see a review of these headphones where the user thinks the sound quality is great. so if I can't get a decent pair of headphones, i may as well get a portable cd player that will play MP3s!"
4,Break in your boots.,"These are pretty good boots for the price. I recieved them very fast from the supplier. When I wore them for the first time they were a little uncomfortable which is to be expected from a new boot. I read some reviews on different ways to break in new boots. I went with the hot water method and let me tell you, it absolutley works! Just soak your boots in hot hot water for about 15-20 min. and wear them until dry. They slowly mold to your foot and become very comfortable. I went ahead and did this a second and third time and now it feels like I have had these boots for years. I bought them to wear while paintballing so I needed to break them in well before going out on the field. Waiting til that day to break them in would ruin your day. These boots are rad, just make sure you order a size smaller than what you normally wear because they do run big. For example, I wear a mens 10 and went with a Mens 9 and they fit beautifuly. Hope this helps."
2,Good while it lasts,"I was excited for these boots. They fit relatively well (which is hard for me to find) and they were reasonably priced. However, after about 3 weeks of use, there is already a large crack in the soles of each boot. They split across the ball of the foot, which is rather disappointing."
2,Do not hold up like my old pair,"While in the Army, I used to wear jungle boots all the time. I was in the infantry and put them through the lots hard use. That pair lasted me 2 years in the Army and 4 years afterwards. I recently had to let them go - so bought a new pair (These) and they seemed about the same so I had high expectations. Within 2 weeks the sole in the toe area on the right boot let loose. I had them glued by a cobbler (yep we still have one around). Since then, I've noticed the rest of that boot and the other starting to get loose around the sole and there appears to be some cracking in the leather around the bottom also.So basically - I don't give these boots a very high review."
4,"Inexpensive, sturdy, and comfortable.","If you need a sturdy, combat ready pair of speed-lace boots, these boots are an unbeatable value. (Tip: Soak em' in HOT water for 15-20 minutes then wear them as you go about your business. After two hours they will feel like you spent a year breaking them in.)They take a pretty good shine too."
2,"Comfy, but Not Sturdy","I bought these for my husband who needed sturdy and rugged everyday footwear for chasing our kids and playing outside. He wanted combat boots because I'd told him stories of the pair I bought my Sophmore year in high school and wore until they broke apart nearly ten years later. He hates to shop, so not having to buy new boots was a huge selling point for him, as was the cordura uppers, for hot weather. Anyway, he wore these daily for 6 months, at which point the leather across the toes had broken open where his foot bends as he walks, and the side of the boot over the toes had ripped out of the sole completely. It was very, very disappointing and was not the kind of longevity we'd hoped for when we bought these. Our next pair will come from the local surplus store and be all leather."
5,"5 STAR Combat Boots, most definately worth it.","I normally wear the Tan ACU boots for my ARMY JROTC Battalion for Mondays and PT, and let me say, very good for running, hiking, anything physical, and they are SUPER COMFORTABLE. They hold up great and overall excellent performance 10/5 for these boots. And for all of those people who are a little overweight let me say, I weigh 350 pounds and beat my mile run by 10 minutes simply from having comfortable boots, 20-23 minutes last year in work boots, 10-13 minutes in these very good, excellent way to help loose weight fast if you like the outdoors like me- ;)P.S- they are the same as ACU (Tan combat boots) boots only black."
4,Great shipping time,Boots came sooner than estimated date. Had to reorder a size up though. They were extremely helpful in reorder process. Would order again from them!
1,Poor Quality,5090 G.I. TYPE BLACK CORDURA NYLON SPEEDLACE JUNGLE BOOTWhen these boots arrived I was disappointed. I read the reviews telling how good of a boot they were and I made the mistake of assuming they were USA made. They are not. These are Chinese Made Jungle boots and I can attest from experience they are of poor quality and the sole will detach from the boot in a short period of time. While Supply Sergeant did issue a quick refund it still cost be $10 to ship the product back to the supplier. I would suggest that you not purchase these boots and that if you're looking for a quality boot that you stick to American made products.
4,good boot so far,"these boots arived before the delivery time. some people have posted that they get cracks on the end of the boots but so far i dont see any cracks, the 4 star rating is because the lases need to be a little longer but i figure i can get bigger lases at walmart."
4,A very useful learning tool,"This is a brilliant idea. I did not give five stars because the first one I received was on a faulty disc and had to be returned, but Amazon made it really easy and the second disc I received is fine. I hope this company makes more of these DVDs in the future."
5,Fantastic!,"This is my vote for the best jazz album of all time. Blakey does things with drums that are impossible for anyone else on a typical day, but this album finds him in rare form--the title track is phenomenal, the Hubbard tune ""The Core"" is outstanding. A rare combination of first-rate material and an ensemble that reads each other's minds--and a particularly powerful performance by the great Art Blakey! If you love jazz, this is an absolute ""must have,"" a truly fantastic record by one of jazz's ""baddest"" groups."
2,Boring,Eldon Taylor drones on and on without getting to his point. I am certain there is great information in this selection yet it isn't easy to stay focused on it long enough to find it.
3,Nice introduction,"Nice introduction to the interlationships between a person's emotions and their effect on a person's physical condition. Book has good use of citing and summation of source material, as well and showing his train of thought in reaching his conclusions."
5,Outstanding,"I was eager to purchase this new release, as I have cherished my copies of Nicolas Matar's Tropicalism, Journeys, and Sun Dance. As with the others, I wasn't disappointed. Disk 1, arranged by Matar, is pure gold. I listen to it daily and absolutely love it. Disk 2, by Graff, is equal to the first in quality. I've had several dinner parties with this duo playing, and without fail, everyone asks who it is. Several friends went out and purchased the album the next day. Whether casual listening at home, in the car, or for a party or dinner, this album is perfect!"
3,"Heartfelt, but lacking","As the songwriter for Big Tent Revival, Steve Wiggins was a songwriter extraordinaire. His shift from popular Christian music with depth to a more personal, ""praise"" centered sound has left me dissapointed.Track six ""Living for the Lord"" is as solid as anything he ever wrote for Big Tent. Unfortunately, this CD lacks the cleverness and double entendre so prevalent in his earlier writing.My guess is that Steve abandoned skillful, adroit songwriting because he felt it focused more attention on the songwriter instead of the Lord. His heart is in the right place.If Wiggins next CD returns to his God-given songwriting talents, it is a guaranteed 5 stars. Until then, 3 stars is all I can give his post-Big Tent effort."
2,Extremely disappointed...,I am a Linda Howard fan and have read her books again and again.The last 3 books were extremely disappointing.This one was not at all interesting.There is no depth in this book.I should have checked it out from the library instead of wasting my money.Next time I will wait and read the reviews first.Its time to try new authors and not wait anxiously for a Linda Howard book.
4,Much better than the last two,"I will read (and reread) anything that Linda Howard writes. I love her style and the people who populate her books, but was very disappointed in her last two books--I hate to read first person and did not especially enjoy reading about a female assassin. This book is much better. The characters were interesting and well developed, and the pace of the book was fast enough to keep me reading. I always enjoy reading an author's vision of the future. Howard's take was intriquing and not unbelievable. I liked her view of a society that keeps what works. Her introduction of cloning and the problems that could result was thoughtful and balanced.""Son of the Morning"" is still my all time favorite. This book is not at that level, but it's much closer than her last two. Thank heavens."
2,"Bad, bad, really, really bad","Ms. Howard is being pushed too hard to write something if this book is the result. Thin, implausible to the extreme, insulting to Kentuckians everywhere and just plain stupid. I rarely put a book down but this effort was so embarassing, I scooted to the trash shoot lest anyone think I actually purchased it."
1,Did she really write this?,"I normally love Linda Howard's novels. I think she is an excellent storyteller and I had never come across one of her books that I didn't like. However, from the beginning of Killing Time, I wondered whether Howard actually wrote this book. It lacks pretty much all of the hallmarks I have come to expect of Howard's writing, including character development, development of chemistry between the leads, a plot that captured the imagination; I could go on. I forced myself to finish it thinking that it would get better by the end. It didn't, and I was left with the impression that someone edited the goodness out of a Howard creation, or switched the manuscript for another author's. In any case, I would not recommend Killing Time, or if you must read it, at least don't expect it to be up to Howard's usual great standards."
1,Just couldn't finish it....,"If this were the first novel I read by Linda Howard I would never pick up another one. The story was just flat, I tried and tried but I could never finish it. Finally decided life was too short and I must move on. If you are looking for a good read by this author, try: Dream Man, Mr. Perfect, Midnight Rainbow (personal favorite), or just about any other she has written."
2,What happened Linda?,"I really anticipated reading this book. Because I knew I wouldn't have time, I bought the unabridged audio CD since I had to make an 8 hour drive. BIG mistake! On top of the book not being so great, the person chosen to read was absolutely awful. Her reading got so annoying at times that I had to turn the CD player off. The book was nothing compared to earlier novels. And that evil lady that read for her should never ever be hired by an audiobook production company again!"
1,Boring....,"I own almost every book that Linda Howard has written and am a huge fan, but this book(in my case CD version)was totally boring. It started out good with the mysterious disapearance of a time capsule, but the more the story continued, I found myself losing attention. This one is not worthy of others Linda Howard has written."
1,Not so good,This was one of the worst books I have read. It is more like a SIC-FIC book not a Linda Howard book. Just read about half of it and did not even finish it then took it to the used book store to sell. Her older books are much better than this.
4,Mystery with a sci-fi twist is light fun...,"This is my second Linda Howard book, and I enjoyed both of them. She seems to either enthrall or disappoint her fans, with not many reviews inbetween the raves and the pans. I liked the characters, found the plot good enough, and was satisfied with the ending. Of course, my copy came from the library, so I wasn't out any cash. If you enjoy detective novels, time-travel trouble tales, and light romances featuring men and women who develop lust and love for each other while they are in danger, give this a try."
1,"UNLESS YOU ARE IN TO SCIENCE FICTION,",don't buy this book. I prefer Linda Howard over any other author but this book was a disappointment to me. I hope she stays away from sci fi in the future.
1,This can't be Linda Howard,"I could not get into this book. I tried, really tried, but I gave up.Frankly, I have not truly enjoyed her books, since Mr. Perfect, and Open Season. The humor is gone. I loved the humor mixed in with the suspence. I will not be buying her new book either.Darn.Karen"
2,Don't Bother,"It used to be I'd buy anything sight unseen by this author. I'll have to re-think this in the future. This story is a rip-off of her previous Son of Morning, but with much less flair. The story is choppy, and senseless, not a good read at all. I think Ms. Howard may be tapped out as far as good story lines go, too bad because I really used to enjoy her books."
1,"THERE OUGHT TO BE A ""ZERO"" FOR STARS!","I forgot to be careful when I got this LH novel. I only like her when she takes herself and her stories less seriously (i.e. Open Season and Now You See Her, which had some pretty funny stuff in them). But, unfortunately, Linda Howard takes herself way too seriously, way too much of the time. In her world, the men are dominating and competent, and the women are impotent and useless. Blech!"
3,OK for supernatural buffs,"I am a big Linda Howard fan and this book was not a total disappoitment, however, if you do not like huge supernatural twists, then this is not the book for you. It still has the romance we all love in Linda Howard novels, but the suspense was a little boring to me because of the supernatural twists. I prefer Howard's more ""realistic's"" much more; such as Cry No More and Kiss me While I Sleep. Those two were 5 plus stars!!!"
1,First a beach bunny and now this?,"I'm a fan of SciFi and time travel, but this is not Linda Howard's forte. After the beach bunny book and now this one, I'm afraid Linda Howard has dropped off my ""must-read"" list. Someone let me know when she writes another Duncan's Bride or MacKenzie saga.This one's going straight to Bookcrossing and not to my bookshelf to be cherished and read over and over again."
1,Duped!,"I couldn't wait till Linda Howard produced her new novel and typically, I devour her books. But Killing Time was disappointing. Neither the characters nor their romantic relationship evolved. The plot was weak and completely inane. This book was as much a struggle to read as I'm sure it was to write. I was left with the uncomfortable feeling that this book was rushed to meet a publishing deadline and I feel duped."
3,What has happened to good old romance novels,"Good lord this one's a mess, I gave 3 stars because linda howard wrote it. Would not have bought it by any other author. What has happened to a good old romance book,it was so far out 2 thirds through the book, lasers, transporting from one time to the next, kinda like childrens fiction, Star Track or Lost in Space comes to mind, when I want to read this I go buy Dean Koontz or Stephen King not a romance author. Please let us have a book based on nothing but romance, DO NOT RECOMMEND YOU BUY THIS ONE"
2,what was she thinking?,this book was by far one of the worst books by Howard. usually i can't put down one of her books until i'm finished. i almost didn't finish this one. do not bother to buy this book.
2,not up to her usual standard,"I liked a couple of recent Linda Howard books, but I'm sorry I bought this one. The characters are boring and the plot is just stupid - lots of coincidences and everything works out easily. It's more like a new author's first novel, with all the plot holes and one-D characters. Plus it just isn't as intense as her other books."
2,bad time travel,"I generally love Linda Howard, so I was gravely disappointed when I couldn't even slog my way through the whole thing. I'm all for killing time with a book, but this one couldn't do it, even with the title...the time travel paradoxes are just sillythe bleak picture of the future? Come on.The characters were drab and did not capture my interest at all.Over all, simply disappointing."
2,Loyal readers?,"I have spent hours reading and rereading Linda Howard's earlier books. This one had only a few whiffs of classic Howard. For new readers, go for Kill and Tell, Mr. Perfect, Now You See Her, Son of the Morning, Dying to Please, etc.For loyal readers, I have gotten so much pleasure from Howard's novels over the years that I don't begrudge the bucks I paid for the the HB of this one. Give her a break. She has earned it.For Linda. You're too good for this. Get a new editor."
1,I used to be a fan,"This is exactly the kind of novel I normally enjoy: a bit of science fiction, romance and a novelist I've enjoyed in the past. I was disappointed. The character development was shallow. The main characters were likeable but at the end of the book I felt that I had absolutely no emotional connection with the characters or what happened in the book. I felt the plot had a lot of inconsistencies in it (which can be a problem when dealing with time travel). The story read as a preface to a later novel because a portion of the plot was left unresolved. I hope there is no ""follow-up"" novel because I think this was the weakest LInda Howard novel I've read. Save your money and don't buy this one. If you like romance and mystery with a bit of science fiction check out J.D. Robb's series."
1,Major disappointment.,"It seems as if Ms. Howard wrote down random ideas and put them into this book. She introduced too many storylines, without following through. And the ending was very weak. I agree with another reader ""when she's good, she's very, very good"" This is not an example of good, however. Hopefully the next one will be better."
1,What happened here?,"I'm a huge fan and I have read every book Linda Howard has written. Mr. Perfect was her absolute best in my opinion and, even though I'm not a fan of first person novels, I read To Die For and loved it! When I heard that she was putting out another ""paranormal"" novel I couldn't wait! I thought it would be like Dream Man or Now You See Her. I really could have waited an eternity for this one. It was the worst book she's ever put out and I was extremely dissapointed. I couldn't get past the first chapter, but I forced myself, thinking it had to get better....sorry.....it didn't. The story line was totally unbelivable and I hope Ms. Howard continues to write the great suspence romance she's well known for and not sci-fi."
2,Ok as a mystery story.,"The characters did not interest me as much as I would have liked. There was not much in the way of romantic or emotional development. I much prefer Ms. Howard's other books. Story brief: Bad guys from around 2200 time travel back to 2005 to get something of value. Nikita is an FBI agent from 2200 who travels to 2005 to stop them, but doesn't know what they are looking for. She and the police chief Knox work together and fall for each other. Some people are murdered. The author toys with Nikita's lack of understanding of slang. For example, instead of calling someone a ""big baby"" she calls him a ""large baby."" Knox says she might ""split"". She doesn't know that means ""leave."" It wasn't that interesting for me. Sexual language: moderate. Number of sex scenes: two. Setting: 1985 and 2005 small town in Kentucky. Copyright: 2005. Genre: time travel mystery story with a little suspense and a little romance."
2,Wasting Time,"The characters have an annoying OCD - they shower and wash clothes and shower again. I suspect Linda has some germ phobia that's getting worse all the time. I swear to christ I counted SEVEN showers and at least TWO episodes of washing clothes. WTH? Beyond this, her male character reads like a sketch of a man from a drunk woman's point of view. Cliche and boring. Beyond THAT she just misses the story potential. It's about TIME TRAVEL, but the concept is never exploited smartly. Linda should have spent MORE TIME thinking about the implications of time travel and LESS TIME thinking about her main character's next fat erection. Yeah, I finished this book only because I have my own OCD that makes me read until the bitter end. I won't ever read anything else she's written - my time on this Earth is too short."
1,Linda Howard's 2nd Time-Travel story,"In Killing Time, Linda Howard orchestrated elements that she knows how to create and manipulate so well --a small southern town with its customary residents, a mystery, police procedures, family dynamics, personal and universal conflicts, a strong, compassionate hero, a feisty, vulnerable heroine-- to produce a result that satisfies fans and that should attract new aficionados to her work. The glimpses of the future add intriguing touches that accentuate, but do not detract from the story in the present. I especially liked the idea that information and art stored on compact discs will deteriorate and that paper will be one of that future's most valuable commodities."
5,Great Fun,"I read this one in one sitting -- didn't want to put it down. I enjoy both SciFi and Romantic Suspense, so it doesn't bother me at all to have them combined. Yes, there were plot points that needed a clearer explanation, but I survived them. Linda Howard is probably my favorite writer, and I enjoyed this one immensely. I do recommend it."
1,Sucks,"Definitely not one of her better books. No humor. Very little plot. Dull characters. Seems like she just had to rush it out, which is unfortunate since I'm a big fan.Oh well, hopefully, the next one will be better. The last handful have been touch and go, however."
1,It didn't seem like this was written by Linda Howard,"I have ALL of Linda Howard's books. She has been one of my two favorite authors, so I grabbed this when I saw it. The more I read, the more I began to question whether Linda Howard actually wrote this book. It lacks the depth of her other time travel novel, ""Son of the Morning."" In fact, it seems to lack the depth of character, depth of plot, depth of detail, and depth of research of ALL of her other works. It's pale compared to her really great contemporary work, ""Mr. Perfect."" I have heard that when authors get really, really famous and in demand, they sometimes subcontract part or all of a novel to other writers. That was the feeling I got from ""Killing Time."" It was an ""okay read"" but did not seem authentic to Linda Howard's other work and was disappointing from that perspective."
3,Not Bad,I have to say I enjoyed the book. I have a few of Linda Howard's books and I wasn't sure if I wanted to read this one because a few people didn't like it. I did. I thought Nikita was cute and her & Knox fit together. They had spunk. It is a bit Sci-fi but Linda makes it fun. It's not scary and there's not a lot of suspense but I still have to give it 3 stars.
2,Not so great,"I have read just about every one of Linda Howard's books (""Son of the Morning""--wow!!!!!!!!!!). This book was a big disappointment. There was so much potential for interesting description (a flight of fancy) by bringing in the future aspect--but in this book, the future is not so different from now (and that's depressing)."
3,What a disappointment.,"I love Linda Howard, but was terribly disappointed with her latest effort ""Killing Time."" The idea behind the story line is clever but the characters are flat and do not engage the reader. It's a short, thin story dressed up to appear like a major novel. It's not. Mabye my expectations were too high but ""Killing Time"" doesn't even come close to one of her major novels like ""Dream Man"" or one of her shorter works like ""White Lies."""
1,"When she is good, she is very very good, but","When she is bad she is horrid. I am resigned to Linda Howard's fitting this phrase. This is one of the ""horrid"" ones. I share books among a group and this will not be passed outside of our group. Our but is that we'll never give up on her cause we know, when she is good..."
1,Waste of Time,"I have every book that Linda Howard has written. However, this book was just plain awful. I kept checking the cover to make sure that the book was written by Linda. The story was dull, there was no chemistry between the main characters. If you are a first time reader of Linda's please check out Mr. Perfect, To Die For, Son of the Morning, Dream Man, and Now You See Her. These are some of her best books. The lead character from Mr. Perfect has several brothers and I wish she'd write about them. I would recommend that you get this book from the library instead of purchasing it."
3,"A good try, but disappointing","It's great that the author is trying a new genre, but it would seem as if the novel was hastily cobbled together without much thought for plot or character development. Also, I couldn't quite shake off the images of the Terminator that popped into my mind throughout the book. It's a pleasant read, but the effort of trying to decipher all the time travel logistics is too hard work. And the ending was trite and unconvincing. The attempt to inject some mystery into the background of Nikita fell flat and both she and Knox were unexciting characters. The book doesn't offer anything new in either romance or sci-fi."
3,if you have nothing better to do,"Generally, I have enjoyed Linda Howards books. This one unfortunately, is a far cry from her best. It's more like a story line she wanted to explore but just doesn't have the time. Pity..because more thought and depth and this could have been a great read.."
1,I would give this a ZERO if I could,I am much more of a hard core mystery reader than a romantic suspense fan but I have read other Linda Howard books and found them to be an enjoyable way to spend a Sunday afternoon. This one was poorly written in that it seems as though everyone converses only in BOLD TYPE or exclamation points. The hero is too easily convinced by future girl to believe her outlandish story and the secondary plot line between the hero's should have been mother in law and the bad guy from the future was downright laughable. I guess the next book will be all about future girl's parents selling the reams of paper she hid for them to find (in the to be demolished years in the future) building and using the money to find their now older than they are grandkids from the past?
1,"No thanks, Linda!","I normally love Linda Howard, but this book and her last one have been disappointing. This is probably my least favorite Linda Howard book. I am not a sci-fi fan, and would not have purchased this book if I had realized it was that genre. The characters were uninteresting and had no spark, and there were too many unresolved questions at the end of the book. Try again, Linda; I know you still have it!"
1,Slow and Ugly...,"As a huge Linda Howard fan, I bought Killing Time the day it came out in stores. I should have waited until I read some of these reviews. Then I could have avoided the experience of reading this book. I've never had trouble finishing a Howard novel, until I picked up Killing Time. Knox Davis is just an okay guy. The time-traveling Nikita is cold, and as synthetic as her clothing. Forget the murder and mayhem; how their romantic relationship could have developed is the true mystery in this book."
4,A HUGE DEPARTURE,"I GENERALLY ENJOY LINDA HOWARD'S WRITING. THIS NOVEL WAS NO EXCEPTION. SHE DOES SHOW A DISTINCT DEPARTURE FROM HER NORMAL STYLE. THE PLOT IS INTRIGUING. THE STORY IS FAST PACED AND INTERESTING. HOPEFULLY,THIS WILL BE PART OF A SERIES. I WOULD HAVE LOVED TO SEE WHAT HER VISION OF THE FUTURE IS."
3,so-so storyline,"It was definitely interesting to read about the future but other than that it was just okay. I would save my money and wait for the paperback or buy it ""used""."
1,Save your time and money!,"What a disappointment! This book can hardly be described as a romance novel. The main characters had absolutely no chemistry. I was not interested in them at all. It's a strech calling this a suspense or action. Fortunately, I borrowed it from the library. I only wish I saved my time!"
1,please stop!,"please, ms. howard! STOP! please go back to writing paperback books, because the hard back books truely suck! this writer use to be wonderful and now she needs to really think about going back to her daytime job or retirement."
2,It's a streeeeetch!,"Quite a chore to combine elements of mystery, time travel, and romance. As someone else wrote ""the romance seems to come out of nowhere,"" but I will say the sex scenes are fairly hot. The book works, sort of, as escape from reality literature. The ending is of the ""feel good"" variety."
4,Loved the sci-fi twist,"This was my first Linda Howard book and I loved it. I read a lot of the other reviews which slammed this book for the sci-fi undertones, but I love them! I would love more books exactly like this!!"
2,"This wasn't REALLY Linda Howard, was it?","What has happened to the Linda Howard I love to read? I saved this book for two weekends so I would have the perfect quiet time to read it and I could hardly make it through. That has never happened to me with her books before. I find time-travel stories tiresome anyway because so much of the dialogue is wasted on defining vocabulary to the person ""out of time."" The idea was kind of cool but I couldn't feel strongly about either of the main characters and was just ready for the book to end. Sorry. Am hoping for more sizzle in the next book from Ms. Howard."
1,Disappointed,"I have been a Linda Howard fan for years but really did NOT like this book- not even as a fun beach read. I'm typically not a fan of time travel stories, but could have stuck with it if the story was better. The plot made no sense and was completely boring. The characters were bland and there was no reason why they should have fallen for each other. Trust me- skip this one and wait for her next book."
3,Not As Good As Her Other Time Travel Book,"I love LH books. She is an automatic buy for me. I was really looking forward to her second time travel book after Son of the Morning (SOTM) and thought perhaps this book would be as good as that. But I was rather disappointed. Killing Time is nowhere close to SOTM. I got bored halfway and switched to another book. But since I had already bought the book, I forced myself to finish it quickly.I liked the permise of the book - time travel and like Knox was curious about the future. But there was just something missing in the overall book, that something extra that always made LH books automatic reads and repeat reads."
3,time travel tale,"I like most Linda Howard novels,but despite the intriguing premise, I just couldn't get into this one. It took ages to get going despite some good plotting, and for some reason I did not care enough about the main characters. Perhaps it was down to them both being 'careful, guarded' types.I will not be reading this again(my criteria for any 4-star book)but it was worth reading once, and I think most Linda Howard fans will enjoy it."
1,HUGE DISAPPOINTMENT!,"Linda Howard is one of my favorite authors and I couldn't wait to get her newest. Talk about a let down! The story line was boring and the suspense--what suspense? I really wouldn't call this paranormal--more like science fiction and if I would have known it was more science fiction, I would have passed. Bring back the Linda Howard we love from stories like Mr. Perfect and Dying to Please--I miss her!"
2,Killing Time,"The plotline is interesting, but what happened to the editor? There are repeats everywhere. In one short paragraph, ""this morning"" appears three times. Due to poor editing, it was a bit of work to get through what could have been a good story."
1,"Adios, Linda!!","I liked the suspense she has been writing lately but her last three novels suck. So, like Nora Roberts, Janet Dailey, Julie Garwood, Tami Hoag it's adios to you. I love Science Fiction and Time Travel but I can get that online from authors who do it much better than Linda. Linda, your earlier stuff I treasure and always will but I will not fork out $17.00 for this again. I can get GREAT Science Fiction online that I can download to my ebook reader for $6.00 or less. God, I wish I would have read the jacket or reviews before I paid for this book."
4,Suspense With A Different Twist,"In Killing Time, author Linda Howards has branches out and combines suspense, romance, and a bit of science fiction. I commend her for taking a chance and not sticking to the tried and true formula that has made her famous.The contents of a time capsule buried twenty years earlier are missing. There's a murder and no suspects. Out of the clear blue, FBI agent Nikita Stover enters the picture. But there's no record of her existence. Oh, that's easily explained, she's from the future and has come to assist the lead investigator, Knox Davis. Knox is smitten, but what far can he go with a woman who is apt to evaporate in a puff of smoke?This was an exciting read filled with edge-of-your seat terror and I look forward to more of Howard's work in this unique genre."
4,The thrill of a singer discovering herself,"An old girlfriend of mine, upon hearing this album, said it sounded like a woman singing to herself in her kitchen. I haven't come up with a better description since. There's an intimacy, an innocence to Sheila's singing here that is enthralling. Sheila went on to record some masterful albums -- 1977's Sheila and 1989's Lost & Found being among the best -- but it is with Portrait of Sheila that we discover a singer discovering herself. Her mirth is contagious in ""Falling in Love with Love,"" her wistful remembrances in ""When the World Was Young"" enter the listener's heart like a sigh, and her sorrows are laid out in all their blue beauty in ""I'm a Fool to Want You,"" the loveliest version of this song I have ever heard. This is an essential album for any jazz collection."
5,Awesome gift!,"I got this for a friend of mine, and I wasn't expecting too much. The book got to my house in new condition, with a CD. It was very unexpected, but it was awesome! Made me feel very confident about giving it away and buying it. Really helpful teaching tool!"
5,Thorough and Entertaining Reference Book,"Based on the reviews, the first book I bought on this subject was Edly's Music Theory for Practical People. Don't waste your money on that book, or you may very well feel like an idiot due to the incomplete and confusing presentation of music theory. Instead, be intelligent and become well informed on this subject by buying The Complete Idiot's Guide to Music Theory. The subject is presented thoroughly and in a logical manner. Michael Miller is a skilled author and a skilled musician who not only is very knowledgeable about music theory, but knows how to teach it."
2,"NUMEROUS ERRORS, MISLEADING EXPLANATIONS & MISSING CRITICAL DETAILS","Don't buy this book. It contains far too many fundamental errors. It obviously has not been proof read dispite the fact that this is a 2nd edition. Why read something that you can't trust. Two far SUPERIOR books are ""Edly's Music Theory for Practical People"" by Ed Roseman and/or ""Hearing and Writing Music: Professional Training for Today's Musician"" by Ron Gorow. Both of these books are available thru Amazon. Your best bet is to take a look at copies of these books at your local library before purchasing as I always do."
1,"I still feel like an idiot, for having bought this book","I have struggled with this book. For a person with no prior knowledge of notes, intervals, etc., Chapter 2 on Intervals is more confusing than clarifying. I have come to rely on Internet searches to gain an understanding of Intervals.The end-of-chapter exercises are useful because they confirm that one does not know the subject matter intended to be explained in the chapter.Weak, really weak."
1,Professional music theory is very complex,"If you major in music in college, you will take several semesters of music theory courses. It is a very deep and complex topic. It is essential for masterful composition, and analysis, of ""classical"" music. Music lovers and hobbyists need only a superficial but carefully chosen introduction to music theory. This book fails to provide that."
5,Now it all makes sense,"When I was a kid I took lessons for electric bass. I just could not get into reading music and gave up. When I got older I gave it a second shot and it still made no more sense to me. I could play bass well enough and had been in a few local punk bands. With each instructor it was usually ""this is what an E looks like, now memorize it"" I saw this book and decided to order it. When I started reading this book it was a great feeling to actually start understanding why music is written the way it is. This book helped me tremendously."
5,amazing book,"if you have no idea what your doing but want to start writing music or even just want a little knowhow, this is a great place to begin"
4,I can't get it back!,"I bought it for my hubby and he won't let me use it! Lots of good information, even for someone with a music background."
1,a heads-up,"This book is ONLY for pianists/keyboardists. If you're a guitarist or play any other instrument, this book is rather useless. The author himself advises you to buy a piano/keyboard.(Ha!Ha!Ha!) To quote him, ""You can use this book without having a keyboard, but then you'll have to envision some of the examples in your head."" Enough said.It would have been more honest on his part to have added ""....for pianists."" to the title."
2,Not for begginers,"I bought this book to refresh some concepts that I studied 10 years ago. But what is seemed like a simple and basic book turned out to be a confusing and frustated explanation of music theory. The book repeats too much things that are not very well explained and it assumed that you know already music theory. I do not recommend this book to someone with no previous music knowledge period, but to the experience musician that wants to refresh his stuff."
2,Can't stand on its own,"You need a teacher, or someone who knows what they're doing, to help you along with this book. When you hit an exercise you don't understand, all you have to fall back on are the answers at the back of the book. If those don't answer your question, you've hit a brick wall. This book and others seem to advertise themselves as ""teach yourself music theory,"" which is like saying you can teach yourself math solely with a math textbook. Caveat emptor."
3,Too Much of a Beginner,"The book is probably very good for someone who has some background in music. I purchased it for my husband as he has absolutely no musical knowledge, and it was just way too advanced for him. I really wouldn't call it an ""idiots"" guide.just to advance for him."
5,Where has this book been all my life?,"I recently have begun to get back into music and I was really disappointed in the music theory books out there -- I don't remember it being this hard. But then I found The Complete Idiot's Guide to Music Theory! Mike Miller breaks it down and makes it easy to keep up. Thanks, Mr. Miller for this much needed book!"
5,Music Theory A-Z | (This books got it all),"When it comes to Music Theory, even if we pratice it everyday, it is very difficult to teach it to someone else.But lucky for us that's what teachers are for, So lets go sign up for a Music theory class at our local college right? no way!Forget classes, Just run down to your local barns & noble or click a few buttons on your mouse after reading this review, wait a couple of days for your book to arrive, and then find a nice quiet place to read.Starting off with the very basics (tones and pitches) this book will teach you everything you've ever heard aboutMusic Theory and more. Each chapter, which is talently explained and illistrated, builds your budding Music Theory skills untell you're at a point of being able not only compose your own music, but play and understand any sheet music you incounter.Without any doubt this would be the first book I would recomend to anyone wanting to learn Music Theory."
5,I'm learning already,I understand more now than I have over the past two decades excellant service and product price
2,This game was a real disappointment,"I follow NASCAR and look forward to the release of the NASCAR game every year. In previous years I have enjoyed the career mode where you start in the Whelan series and work your way up to the Nextel series. I thought with the PS3 version, there would be lots of extras and career modes. However, the career options are very limited and have not held my attention. Also, in trying to allow you to set up the cars for racing, they have made it impossible to control the cars even in easy modes. It is impossible to get through a race without causing a yellow flag (the yellow flag is thrown so quick, sometimes you don't even see the wreck). I think this game will be a trade-in at Gamestop for Dirt which has a great demo on the PS3."
2,I would not bother yet.....,"I purchased this game and I have to admit that the graphics are pretty amazing. The worst part of this game is the lack of split screen racing. In previous versions, you can race in split screen mode which is the fun part of being with friends. The PS2 and XBOX 360 versions are 1-2 players locally, so why not the PS3 version?Bad move in my opinion by EA. For this reason, unless you just want to have some fun without being able to race friends sitting next to you and talking trash, I would not bother buying this game."
1,to hard,"to hard for the average gamer , boring if you don't even like NASCAR, could've made it easier , no multiplayer if not online"
1,"""DISAPPOINTED""","A (PS3)VIDEO GAME SHOULD BE DESIGNED AS/FOR ""FUN"" ENTERTAINMENT. PS3, EA'S ""NASCAR 08"" IS ""FRUSTRATING"" ENTERTAINMENT.I REALLY ENJOYED THE ""PS2"" VERSIONS OF ""NASCAR"", AND THOUGHT THIS PS3 ""08 NASCAR"" WOULD BE EVEN BETTER, NOT SO, ""DISAPPOINTED""! FOR EXAMPLE, TO MANY THINGS TO DO JUST TO GET TO THE STARTING LINE IN ""CHASE"" MODE, NOT ""FUN""!!"
2,Graphics are good!,Graphics are good and i liked the game. But now many new games have come with much better graphice and better sound quality!
4,paradox of oscar wilde,"The paradox of Oscar Wilde is exactly the same book which is called Oscar Wilde: The Double Image. I bought them both and got disappointed..Anyway the book is fundamental to see the figure of Ocar Wilde as integral part of the Victorian environment where to be ""double"" was a rule. It is then your task to demonstrate that Wilde somehow went beyond this duplicity, and was thus greater than his age.A detailed book, even if it does not contain much information on Wilde's Irish background."
4,916 Sacramento South 2 Da North,"Greedy is one of the unknown Sac Town rappers thats about to blow up the music scene. Raps with Lynch, C-Bo, Mr. Doctor, and Killa Tay. He can also be found on Dubb Saks Cd Bad to The Bone doing a song with Dubb Sak & Killa Tay."
3,verdict still out,"made me shaky, not sure if it was this or not yet, trying to add back one suppliment at a time to find the culprit,"
4,"How do you say ""over-engineered""?","Yes it's handy to have such a small recorder, with such long recording length and no tape to worry about. That's why I squeezed out four stars instead of three. But the manual -- and the learning curve instructions it purports to explain -- is irritatingly unclear and tricky. I'm glad to have it now ... and I look forward to one with greater ease of use and finesse one day. For example, if Macintosh ever makes one ...."
4,Great for notes; less great for longer text,"LOVE the portability and size, love not having to worry about tapes. Great for quick notes. But if you try to record long conversations (I'm a speechwriter and record input from my clients), the controls are so sensitive that you can end up wasting time through failed attempts to scroll back to earlier dialogue (ending up in a different file, instead, and having to re-start.) A terrific invention, but it truly seems better for fast ""to do"" notes than for long text files you later wish to process."
1,Keeps on breaking,I have a Panasonic RR-QR240 and a RR-QR80. The QR240 was purchased in Oct 2000 and the QR80 was purchased in August 2001. The QR240's speaker went out. I had to put a headset on it to hear messages. I purchased the QR80 to fill in while the QR240 was being repaired. It was promptly returned to me by a service center out of Georgia. Their repair lasted about three days. So I put it in the drawer and continued to use the QR-80. Today the microphone when out on it. So now I have two of them that broke. In just over a year I have spent about $200 on units that do not work. Try a Sony.
4,A lot of bang for the buck!,"Panasonic does it again. I experimented with many brands, but it seems that I can always count on Panasonic to give me some of the best features, sound, and quality for a reasonable price. The look and feel of the display and controls seemed as if they belonged on a set that cost ... more. One exception - no batteries included with the remote control?! Sound is very good, operation is smart, and a lot of features for the price. For a boombox, I was also amazed at how loud I could go before distortion. Again, for the price its hard to beat. It's not the quality of a mini-component system but the price isn't as high either. This will accompany my 1982 Panasonic boombox that still sounds & works great, but does not have a CD player."
1,"Sorry, but the one I got was a lemon!","I had to return this one because (1) it didn't work on batteries and (2) the cassette door opened and the heads spun and clicked every time the power button was turned on. I replaced it with a Sony CFD-S47, which works great, and, as a bonus, takes up much less space on my desk."
1,Returning this one,"Even if it worked...The engine loses the signal from the remote sporadically, no matter how close you are to it. Plus, for a three year old, it is very difficult to tell which way the remote should be held; up is down, down is up. In order to back the engine up to connect to the cars, the connectors (magnets)must be perfectly aligned. I was never able to do it without manually pushing the connector into place; I can't imagine a three year old being able to do it. Any time you go in reverse, the train goes into a sequence of catching & releasing the cars; my nephew couldn't understand why every time he backed up, the cars fell off! Boo!"
4,In general a good book,"In general this is a good text book for teaching undergraduate level Chinese politics. I did find that some of the points in the book are bit biased, but it is less misleading as some of the other text books published in this field."
4,So Bad It's Good,"I'm Bout It is a rare black film, that's so bad it's good. The acting is horrible, camera angles and cinematography are all done with a home camera and the script doesn't flow. I mean you can't help but laugh when a man is tied up and sweaty, replies to his captors by saying f**k you, like he's gonna do something."
1,YA'LL DOWN SOUTH #IGGAZ CAN'T ACT NY BABY!!!!!!!!,THE ONLY GOOD PART OF THE MOVIE WAS THE PART WHERE P LOOKED LIKE A GIRL!!!!!!!
3,OK. KINDA FUNNY . NOT ABOUT NOTHING,THE MOVE WAS OK. DOPE FEEN WILLIE MADE IT FUNNY. IT DIDNT HAVING ANY MEANING. YOU COULD TELL THAT IT WAS A GHETTO FILM. ALL THAT MONEY THAT P HAS HE COULD HAVE MADE A BETTER MOVIE. WHERE DID THEY GET THOSE ACTING SKILLS? THEY NEED TO STICK TO MAKING CD'S THAT TOP THE CHART. ONE LOVE MISS LAZY OKC-OK
5,M-Dawg :Who doesn't love down south #iggas ?@Waz Up P!,Yo P your movie was the $hit! All your movies are though! Ya'll BUSTIN @ss #oes can't phase NO LIMIT! NO LIMIT FOR LIFE! PEACE!
1,"Don't waste your time, UNHHHHHHH!","If you like poor acting, glorification of ""ghettoes and gangsters and guns"" (oh, my), outrageously dated dialougue, crude sexuality, and needless violence (as well as hard core gagster-rap), then throw your money away on this mess. ... As Master P (Percy Miller) himself would say, UNHHHHHHHH!"
3,"A must for local history buffs...but not for anyone else, really.","This book is invaluable to me as someone obsessively interested in the history of the ghost towns of central New Mexico. Even to me though, it's not the most gripping read.The chapter on the wrongfully condemned town of Tejon, New Mexico is outstanding, and the book contains a lot of great, hard-to-find information. It's structure, however, its lack of an index, and its inability to find and tell the fascinating stories buried within the information it contains makes it not exactly something to read for fun. But if you live in central New Mexico, if the words ""La Madera Road"" turn you on, if you care about what was here before your parents were, then buy this, buy this for sure."
2,I miss my Sony,"The sound quality is not nearly as good as my old Sony walkman. If you haven't tried this out in a store, don't buy it. If you are used to superior sound quality this isn't the walkman for you."
3,"Good Sound but,",the earphhones hurt your ears. If your going to buy this product buy a different set of headphones. These heasphones aren't adjustable they don't fit right on your head and the piece that goes in your ear has no cushion so they are uncomfortable.
5,The best portable tape player i had,I got this Panasonic player back in April of 2000. Up to today I hadn't have any problems. I dropped more than 100 times already and still work perfectly. One of the beauty of this player is the battery life with one AA it can play up to 28 hours. INCREIBLE BUT TRUE. If u want a player to last u a few years I recommend u to buy this one.
4,good but not great,"Its a good piece but with some reservations. First it doesnt have belt clip. Second the head phone is not comfortable. If you plan to keep your headphone on for longer time, either get another headphone with the piece or look for another walkman. Sound quality is good. Metal body is advantage in terms of sturdiness. compact design and silver colour make it great in appearance. Runs on single bettery, another appealing feature. But I really doubt the utility of VMSS(you feel vibration in your ears and head according to music you are listening). Its not the feature for which you should be buying the unit. Otherwise great listning."
3,"good bass&sound quality, but..................","this product has a good bass and sound quality , but the only problm that i encounter was the size of the headphones is too small, it can fit to your ears but it hurts a little bit , the ear phones has a sharp round shape so if u move alot it can hurt your ears. THE good of this product is the sound quality and the kick of the bass is cool , u can feel it through your back bones, and the features is also good , plus remote control inside the headphones is also an excellent features. oh by the way , if the Panasonic can fix the headphones problem , u can say that this product is worth enough for 70 dollars u pay"
5,Great,"great product does fall over time if not stable, if your connecting cage to cage its perfect but if its going to something else thats being supported by the tubing then it will fall, its happened to me. so make sure that it is stable!!"
