2,"Picture, description are misleading and wrong!!!","Description and picture misrepresent SC-D303 (I think it's for model SC-D305/307 which isn't sold yet).SC-D303 DOES NOT have accessory shoe NOR video light.""Standard light"" is not a part of package.There's no remote either.It's a good camera, but not what's being described here in editorial or on most sites including Samsung which shows wrong picture too!!!My purchase is going back!"
3,the scd107,"i looked around sears at the scd107 samsung camcorder and it is actually better than the scd303 and cheaper (...) , the scd107 may be a little bit bigger than the scd303, but it had features that the scd303 doesnt have for a cheaper price, like a video camera light, a massive 3.5 lcd screen, the picture quality is better and there is a bigger zoom of 20x optical and 900x digital zoom too. i have changed my mind about the scd303 and am buying the scd107. just in case you dont know im am the one who writ the title ""you forgot"" too."
3,Blade Sharpener,It works Ok for the price.At least it gives you the correct angle.Good for touching up a blade. Do not recommend for heavy grinding. Balancer is nice. beats the old nail in the wall way.
2,It's all Plastic!!!,"It appears from the color to be made of metal but it is cheap plastic, if I would have known this I would not have bought it! I have a Kubota ZD326 mower and the blades are very thick. This balancer does not work well with commercial blades"
4,could be more quality,It has done its job in filing but I can see that the plastic bottom piece will probably wear down really soon. Also the cone in the picture doesn't do a great job in balancing the blade. A nail on the wall would do a better job.
2,Mower Blade sharpener,This Sharpener is Kinda bogus. The stone isn't coarse enough to grind the blade without going over it at least 20-30 time then it is questionable. I ended up using my file & bench grinder to finish the sharpening job. The Balancer works great.
5,Salvation Issue,"It would have taken me decades to finally start surrendering to God's providence of my life if it wasn't for this book, but God has used Gordon to help us understand one of the big three topics in the Bible. faith (surrender), love and hope. If you actually put into practice the suggestions given by this book, it works and I am here to testify it is working for me."
1,Let's send this DVD to another world.,"One of the worst movies I can ever recall watching. Choppy editing; long, drawn out scenes that lead nowhere; poorly written characters and dialogue; ugly cinematography. Combine that with an awkward looking DVD cover; poor audio quality on the DVD (you have to turn the TV volume way up, only to have the next thing you put on blow your speakers off the TV); and no choice of English subtitles; and content and presentation wise, this one is truly at the bottom of the barrel."
1,Wake Me When It's Over,"This has got to be one of the most boring not to mention WORST movies I've ever seen. The only saving grace is that Julianne Moore is in it and I feel embarrased for her. What a terrible waste of talent and her time. Typically, I love road movies but do yourself a favor and pass on this one. The main character is so selfish and loathsome that it makes it impossible to immense yourself in the movie which doesn't matter anyway because the movie itself goes nowhere."
1,"A meandering, self-indulgent piece of sh*t.",The title of the review pretty much says it all. View at your own risk.
3,LOOKING FOR TROUBLE,"More than sex, food or survival, we are creatures driven to find meaning in our lives (or so it's said by those who claim to know such things). A recent film that taps into that mindset, with varying degrees of success, is now available in a fine digital edition.Handsome Cal (Billy Crudup) is driving aimlessly across the country in WORLD TRAVELER. He's left his wife and kid and is looking for something else. Something better. Something he can't quite define. Trouble is, he spends so much time drinking and in bars that trouble is his constant companion. This sly film that never explains itself reminds me of Jack Nicholson's rootless wanderings across open landscapes in The Passenger and Five Easy Pieces. Directed by Bart Freundlich (The Myth of Fingerprints) and with affecting performances by Crudup, Julianne Moore, Karen Allen and others, World Traveller is irritating, provocative and open to interpretation."
1,A beautiful title for a poorly written book,"I was very hopeful when I purchased this book that it would be something I could recommend to other parents. Sadly, I have to strongly not recommend it to anyone. This book is entirely too biased, categorizes entire professional bodies of thought to empty stereotypes, and while I respect the author's pain and struggle, it does no good to read how she rejected just about everyone who tried to help her. (As a strong Christian, if I'd gotten an appointment with a good diagnostic team, I would have kept one.) This entire book was a disappointment and gives no help or encouragement at all to anyone walking this path."
5,Be sure you're ordering the new edition!,"My friend ordered this book several weeks ago, and finally just got notice from Amazon that they are unable to get this title in the old edtiion (2000)---it is out of print except for the copies on the Marketplace feature. If you want to order this book, click on ""other editions"" above. This will take you to the Amazon site of the newly released second edition (2005) of this title. That one ships to you within 24 hours.There are many new copies of this new edition available and it is well worth reading. It is updated with Drew's progress and more information. It is recommended by Joni Erickson Tada and has a forward written by Ted Tripp. Be sure to order the new 2005 edition!"
5,definately christian,"After reading numerous wonderful books on autism and having searched for a christian book about a family with an autistic child I was wrapped at finally having found it in this book. I have not quite finished the book yet but couldn't wait to extend my recommendations to other christian parents, families, special support workers etc, on this book. I was wrapped to read about their church life, friends etc. Its definately a christian book. Easy read and well worth the money i paid for it. Thanks so much for having this book available."
5,Why the Controversy?,"Looking at the reviews it's obvious that this book is a ""love it or a hate it.""If you are not a Christian you will probably hate this book.Many profess Christianity, but still have a humanistic world-view rather than a Scriptural one and those readers will certainly be offended as well. Humanists are blind to what the Bible has to say about the nature of man.""For the time is coming when people will not endure sound teaching, but having itching ears they will accumulate for themselves teachers to suit their own passions,"" 2 Timothy 4:3If your aim is to please God and not man and to do what is best for your children then you will find this book to be a great help and encouragement. You will love it!"
5,Quality and Durability!,"This is pretty impressive system! Being an ASE Master Technician I can definitely appreciate it's function over the first Thermo Actuators and even the replacement AC Delco kit. Why hack into your wiring harness as with the Delco Kit (which retails for several hundreds) when the Posi-lok system is so cut and dry? In all reality you do not have to even raise the vehicle, nor drop the axle tube or drain the differential fluid as the directions call for. It's that easy. The cable is very solid (much larger diameter than I expected) and the kit is excellent. Perfect for anyone who definitely wants to be sure that their vehicles' 4WD system is going to work when snow clouds are on the horizon or the road ends. A+"
1,4X4 Posi-Lok DO NOT BUY,"I bought a 4X4 Posi Lok for my low mileage Suburban. The stock actuator failed at the worst time possible. The OEM components were a little more expensive, so a reliable mechanical setup seemed like a good idea. Wrong. I recieved the correct kit that was missing parts. I called the manufacturer, whose rep was friendly the first time, but after not recieving anything for two weeks, I called again and he became surly and informed me he'd probably sent the parts, but that may have been the other guy that needed components to complete his kit! My vehicle was out of service over a month, whereas OEM components could have been installed in a few hours.Do not waste your time and money on 4X4 Posi Lok, go to the dealer and get the right parts the first time."
5,A Must Buy,"This is one of the best books I have come across to help children, parents, teachers and friends understand the ADHD girl. I raised a son with ADHD and it was totally different than helping raise a granddaughter with ADHD. I am buying copies for my granddaughter, her mom, her LD teacher at school, and her teacher this year."
3,Better Than Many,"The product was received in a timely fashion and was well-constructed. The first 4-5 nights were a dream; then the pillow started to break down a bit and is not as supportive as previously. I would have wanted to know more about the density and quality of the foam in the pillow.If you are OK with intermediate support, this one might work for you. It settles down to a 3-4"" loft with use. Since purchasing this pillow, I have ordered another from a producer of these rolls for physical and massage therapists, which is made from upholstery grade foam. Hopefully this will perform better for me."
3,Size matters,"I received exactly what I ordered, unfortunately after one night I realized I ordered the wrong size. It would probably help if some type of guide for sizing were included in the description."
3,Not sold as advertised,"I most anticipated both LIVE! DVDs as pictured above. I was disappointed to discover that ""Soul of Strength"" is replaced with a Level 1 ""The Initial Challenge"" DVD. Not what I wanted! I decided to contact the seller and discovered that, to their credit, it is mentioned in the sellers description, but it was something I never would have noticed. So advanced Yogee's beware. If you want the LIVE DVDs, buy them separately."
5,Action filled but slow to the point,"I really enjoyed this movie, the suspense was great. Samuel L. Jackson's role really made me look at him in a whole new light ha. But the hanging question throughout the movie was why John? It wasn't until almost at the end of the movie when you find out why this was happening. And when that revelation was brought up it made perfect sense (don't want to spoil the movie)."
3,Worth A Watch...,"Not the best ending I've seen, but the rest of the movie was good. Pretty gruesome. I have never seen Samuel Jackson play a character this dark and evil. Worth a watch..."
2,Boring boring boring,"I bought the movie because of the A class actors but was soo disappointed at the quality of the movie. the suspense missed the mark big time! The only good thing was after reading the reviews, i decided to buy a used copy, so not so much of a loss. But i would love to sell the dvd.lol"
5,Great movie,"The perfect cast to pull off this movie. It keeps you on,the edge of your seat. Samuel L. Jackson is a great acter and does an amazing job with this character."
3,"INTERESTING IDEA, JUST NOT WELL EXECUTED...","I was expecteing this movie to have a little more efffort given to the story line, but was left somewhat disappointed. I felt like there were a lot of open ends at the climax of the film.I probabaly will not watch this movie again."
3,Interesting suspense thriller,"Well acted thriller, but It's hard to gather any kind of real plot from the story. Perhaps that's the idea...Samuel L. Jackson's character is pure evil.Strong movie throughout up until the end. Just a little bit lacking in my opinion."
1,worth half the price,I watched this as a Prime customer for free. It was worth about half of that. Very similar to stepping in dogcrap. Now I have to go bathe.
3,An interesting premise....,"The devil wants you, you can't get away? You may find yourself in circles of evil that you cannot escape from? I don't do full plot analysis in these reviews...I address what did and did not work for me. Samuel L. Jackson gave a typically strong performance, but it really wasn't his best role. The supporting cast is OK. However, I don't buy, believe or even care for these helpless, hopeless victim of evil scenario's...although the modern interpretation of the devil, tempting an ordinary man, was temporarily interesting. This movie is mildly entertaining."
3,"I like Luke Wilson, but movie was just o.k.",I got worn out after worrying about what Sam Jackson was going to pull next. Maybe I just wasn't in the mood for this kind of film.Still like Luke.
1,Senseless,It is hard to put into words how stupid this movie is. It makes little sense...predictable in one way and doesn't make any sense in another way. I almost just turned it off but kept watching hoping it would get better. It did not. About an hour and a half if my life I will never get back.
1,Meeting Evil,This movie is TERRIBLE. Don't waste your time. You'd swear you were watching a home movie shot with a Sony Handicam.. actually more like an SVP Ebay special. The lighting sucks. The videography is TERRIBLE. The plot is poor- at best. The acting is mediocre. I really don't understand why it's gotten such a good rating on Amazon. If I could give it a -4 stars I would.
3,Meeting Evil,Not a movie I would see again but did keep a little suspense but a bit unrealistic in several areas.
4,Well done,"As always, Samuel Jackson delivers, but Luke Wilson is outstanding in his own right. The story was well thought out and the Director knew how to communicate the story clearly and cleanly. Although not the 'greatest' of stories, it tells a tremendous amount about our society and how we react to the world around us. It was nice to see some calm, calculating evil take over instead of psychopathic death and destruction of everything just to solve the problem. I highly recommend this for those to ponder on such situations as occurs in this story. Very well done."
2,boring,"bought this for 3 1/2 year old son who really wanted it. for $75 at a toy store. doesn't come with a person. or tools. and doesn't do much. he was bored with it after an hour. also, its pretty flimsy plastic. you'd think a german made product that costs that much would be better made. I'm going to do playmobil and legos next time. more durable. get more stuff with it."
3,Huge toy,"Good thing it is sturdy because my grandson is rough on toys and and he was digging and scooping the carpet, his other toys and everything else in sight."
4,Great toy for boys,"My 3 year old loves this exavator. Very easy mechanical function for younger kids, only one handle/level controls entire scooping action. The only negative is that if used in sand it will no longer allow the kid to turn in circles due to sand getting caught in the groovves"
2,MUCH SMALLER THAN I THOUGHT IT WOULD BE,The ad for this toy showed the child sitting on it and digging in a dirt pile. I was quite disappointed when I first saw this toy as there is no way my 2 year old god son could sit on this toy. I decided to give it to him anyway. He seemed to still enjoy it.
1,"Looks great, work well - DELICATE",Do not plan to use this or any Bruder toy in dirt or sand - Tonka trucks of my youth they are not.
3,3 year old enjoys his own excavator,"My 3 year old son is so happy to have this excavator as his own. He loves pushing it around and using the bucket to help pick up things especially during clean up time. The one track has come off if he applies to much force in pushing it around, but it can snap back on with a little effort. We had purchased it for use outside but it didn't seem sturdy enough for that so we convinced him it will be in inside toy."
2,Won't last long,Nice looking excavator but very expensive and not durable enough for young children. My friends two year old loved it out of the box but I knew it wouldn't be long before it was broken. I think it took less than 24 hours before the arm was broken. Cool design but just not nearly durable enough. At least he can still run around with the arm and turn lights on and off!
2,Flimsy,"Bought this toy for my 4 year old son. I was hoping for a very high quality toy that can last longer for the price. But, this is somewhat flimsy plastic toy. He just had for a month and already broke the bucket control lever. Unless kids playing with this toy is very gentle in handling the controls, it will not last longer."
5,"A boys, boy toy","My 7 year old loves construction equipment. Tracked Excavators are his favorite. I bought this and he plays for hours, sometimes just studying how it moves the dirt. Love it."
4,more fun,"Just had to have the excavator to go with the truck for real play like his Poppys!! Tracks do come off and need to keep putting them back on, and little black clips that hold the tracks on, fall off - found them everywhere on the carpets! Loves taking the bucket on and off."
4,Grandson & grandfather love it!,"We purchased this product along with the truck/trailer/backhoe for our 5 year old grandson after he had such a wonderful time playing with them at his cousin's house. Although they are plastic, they are a heavy duty plastic & seem to hold up to little boys playing quite well. He really enjoys this excavator and his Pepaw enjoys them as well!"
3,ami,"I bought the excavator for my grandson for his birthday. I am worried it will not hold up to playing in the sand, and that is exactly what he will do as soon as he opens it up. I thought it was plastic and metal.. but got in the mail it was all plastic and does not look very sturdy.. Why can't you find the metal construction heavy equipment anymore? I also ordered 2 more with this one and they will be late for his birthday.. Hopefully they are stronger than the first one is......."
3,"nice, but mis-categorized","We bought this for our grandson with shipment directly to him. It came up in an Amazon search for ""ride on shovel"", which is what he requested. We later learned from his parents that he likes the toy but it is nowhere near a ""ride on"" in size or construction. Your kid may love it, but be warned- it is NOY a ride-on, just a large metal toy."
2,"Cool Toy, won't last.","My 4 year-old son got this last year for Christmas. He really loves equipment. This toy is not meant to be played with. It would be a fine shelf resident. He really enjoyed playing it, but it just wasn't durable. The tracks broke and fell off, and the bottom separated from the bottom. My son is not particularly hard on toys."
5,good toy,my son just loves this toy. I wish it was made of metal but the plastic holds up vary good. He is 4.
2,"Caterpillar Excavator, neat toy - does not work well in dirt","I bought this for our 3yo son who loves heavy equipment and digging in the dirt. This is a cool toy as far as being a pretty good replica of a real one but it does not work well in dirt or sand. Fine sediment gets caught in tracks and after a short amount of time, the tracks quit turning. Then the handles on the arm do not move the bucket well. My son has since ripped off the tracks and does not do any digging with it but still enjoys pushing it around. Don't buy this if you want your kid to actually dig dirt, it would be good inside toy or outside but away from dirt or sand. But, I think it was intended for playing in these areas, so the rig is not that well designed."
4,Detailed,"This is a well made detialed model/toy I bought for my 3 year old son's brithday. He likes it very much. He does understand that it is plastic and he must be ""gentle"" or it will break. It is fine for indoor use but I do not think it would hold up outside in a sandbox very well.The hydrulic ram on the boom comes loose or out with aggressive use. I think if the child is not to rough on there toys and doesn't take it in the sandbox it will last a long time, my son is very much taken with it."
1,Broken after 3 days,"My son is obssesed with excavators and if ever there was one made out of durable material it would be great fun for the kids. But I cannot find one that will actually dig up dirt. I like that this one didn't have batteries or sounds, but unfortunately it also didn't have any durability either. The little hinge that makes the arm work broke within three days of use. Bummer."
3,A thrilled 4 yr old,"I apparently didn't check the measurements when ordering, so I was slightly disappointed when it arrived. I thought it was going to be a little bigger. My son thought it was great though which is the most important thing I guess!! He loves any and all construction equipment. My only real problem with this toy is that a piece on the arm has already broken off. My husband is pretty handy so hopefully he can fix it. For the price, this was also a little disappointing."
3,Great Bruder detail but not durable enough for sandbox duty,"Like the other Bruder constructtion toys such as the Mack Dump Truck the detail is amazing. The hydrualics actually move like the real Caterpillar, the tracks make a satisfying rattle as they rumble across my work bench. And the rubber pads for the tracks to work on a slick surface are a nice touch, but it isn't likely this all plastic toy with its attention to detail would hold up well in actual play. As a carpet toy it would probably be fine, and as an adult collectible it is superb, but for actual knock around action an all steel toy takes in stride it would not fair well"
3,Not very durable,"My almost 3 year old is obsessed with all things construction trucks. We have a few Bruders, which we love due to the realistic design and movement. However, this truck did not hold up very good. My son had it a day and he scooped and filled the bucket (blocks, goldfish crackers, quarters), dumped it out, repeat etc many times. He slept with it in his room last night and took it with in the car today all b/c excavator is his favorite. During his play, he was able to detach two of the rods from the arm, they just hook on one end. Somehow in the detachment the arm stopped being able to stay up by itself. It now falls flat when lifted. While it's an otherwise good truck, we were unhappy with the flimsiness of this particular model. It sadly went back to the store."
3,Good Inside Toy,"This is a great toy if you just want to make believe your digging. Not durable enough for the outdoors. 100% plastic. Good design, if it had some metal parts I think it could be a great toy that can actually dig in dirt."
4,Great toy!,"The size alone is impressive and our 4.5 year old loves it. Easy to manipulate, runs well over hardwoods and carpet. Have not taken it outside yet but it seems pretty substantial and so far has provied hours of boy entertainment."
5,Santa brought it,"One of the things my son wanted Santa to bring. It was late in the season when he got to see Santa. This is what he told him he wanted. Looked all over town and could not find one. So, once again Amazon to the rescue ordered it late and was worried it would not make it in time. Came in early, with time to spare. It is well built and pretty tough."
4,k,All the little and big fellows think this one is great. It moves out and can pick things up easily
3,Son loves it parents not so much,My son absolutly loved this gift when he got it on his birthday...However as previous reviews stated I am SICK of putting on tracks!! I am thinking about throwing them away!! Other than that great toy!
3,Graphic SF Reader,"Complicated time cop conflict lacks guns.You are dumped right in the middle of a complicated hunt for technology that is a key to a satellitle that can prevent a war. Maybe. Multiple different people with likely multiple agendas here, so unlikely anything is what it seems, not that much is explained.Lots of martial arts and swords. Must have used up all the gun parts to make the time machines.Pretty decent artwork too, a somewhat more adult style."
1,Don't Bother With this Book,This CRIMINALLY mistitled mess contains next to nothing on the operation of the software. The software's PDF manual is SIX Million times more informative. If you are looking for a book to take you deeper into the workings of Cubase SX (or even trying to access some feature in more depth than the PDF covers) LOOK ELSEWHERE!!!
1,Disappointing,"I don't believe the author has a grasp on what Cubase SX is capable of. If you are after a book that teaches you how to use any version of Cubase SX, you're better off RTFM. (google that if you're not sure)I would be surprised if Steinberg would actually allow such an ineffective guide to one of their flagship products - in fact the book actually makes Cubase seem quite weak and amateurish. Hardly official if you ask me.Finally, the book is incomplete, and not easy to read, opinionated and simplistic."
3,nice album,"while this is a good cd and worth getting,there is no question that The House Of Love masterpiece is BABE RAINBOW from 1992."
1,Good for watering lawns?,"My brother bought this item elsewhere. I knew he was running it when I heard a steam explosion. Came upstairs just in time to witness water spreading out towards his electronics. Water was spraying out of a tube from inside the device out the bottom. An hour later it's still leaking water. I hope most pump driven machines are not like this. Hopefully it was a lemon, but given my luck with warranties of late (or lack thereof.) I'd recommend him return it for another brand fast."
2,Great Machine Until it Breaks,"I had this machine for about eight months. I drink espresso nearly every day (yes I know...I have a problem). The Farberware machine was great until most recently the handle separated from the metal dish that holds the coffee beans. I called technical support and the lady whom I spoke with informed me that the part was discontinued and that I could not get a replacement part, even if I wanted to purchase it. The only solution offered was that if I had a receipt, she could provide me with a comparable machine. This thing was a gift from my mother... Where o where could that receipt be?Humorously, I can still use the machine by twisting the metal container into the housing without the wand. It does still work, but talk about shoddy. Great machine...poor ingenuity on the wand."
2,Poor quality,"Light usage over the course of a year. The handle puled a part from the metal cup that holds the espresso beans. I would not recommend this for anyone that wants to get more than say 40 espressos out of their machine. Up until this point, I was relatively happy with it's performance and design."
3,espresso,The machine is very easy to clean and use. The espresso made with this machine taste good but not fantastic.
1,not even worth the money,"i thought this was a fantastic machine when i got it for christmas... until 2 months after i got it. the handle broke off the thing that you put the coffee in... and if the handle breaks so does the part that the coffee comes out of... and the pressure is messed up so it leaks everywhere now. and there is no way to geat a replacement. this is not even made by the manufacture anymore, so they cant replace the part. If anyone can help me find a replacement please let me know, because i searched 4 months with no luck.now i have to go buy another coffee machine because this one had such a short life."
2,Don't be fooled...,"We have had our machine for 8 months and the handle has broken. If you don't want to use it often, but for a FEW occasional festivities then this is for you. If you regularly drink or even make them twice a month... forget it. The steam wand is also hard to use because of the positioning. Not impressed overall..."
1,"When Amazon's own description begins ""durable plastic""...","... Look out! There is no such thing as ""durable plastic"" (an oxymoron if ever there was one). I bought this lemon from another vendor. There's a reason its only about $90 ... It won't last longer than a month or two of steady use. Like another reviewer also experienced, the handle on the porta filter broke. I returned the first machine and customer service replaced the whole unit at no charge. Machine #2 started leaking after about six weeks, and then the pump quit working. Took it back to the store from whence it came and got a refund."
1,Looks can be deceiving...,"This espresso maker has been an overall disappointment. When it works, the espresso is pretty good - it produces nice crema, warms up fast and the water tank is easy to clean. Unfortunately the water tank is fitted with a spring driven intake valve which is easily clogged or not seated properly. When this happens, the water does not flow through the espresso - instead the pump just runs and runs and nothing happens. Once this cycle starts, you might as well give up - you aren't going to get any espresso until the whole apparatus dries out. Nothing is more frustrating than anticipating your morning espresso and finding out that this machine is not going to work for you that day. I don't have time for this little surprise in my rush to get off to work. So, after a couple of months it is going in the dumpster."
5,Farberware espresso machine is a good deal,"This machine works great! I am an espresso addict who uses my Farberware espresso machine at least once a day. I have had it about a month now, and I can tell you the espresso is consistently good! Also, the machine is very easy to use and clean. You can't beat it for the price."
2,My fault,I purchased the wrong DVD. But if was my fault. I didn't really want this DVD and I didn't like it too much.
3,Good Practice for the Advanced Speaker,"Definately for the advanced speaker, this program is best when the book is used along with the tapes. The accents are easy to understand and a good variety of topics (shopping, travel, computers, wine, architecture) is covered, although there is a strong emphasis on business and technology. The 2nd set of tapes has portions of the conversations on the 1st set, with language review in English and Italian interspersed. My biggest problem with this series is the length and spacing of pauses -- some really long sentences are rattled off all at once with only a short time to respond (really inconvenient while driving) and are then followed by a one word phrase. My Italian has improved since buying these, though, so all in all I would recommend it as a thorough review and practice for the advanced speaker."
5,Wonderful tool for advanced students!,"I am constantly searching for new materials to advance my Italian and I was not disappointed with this set. After just three weeks of listening and reviewing the materials I feel that I have improved my comprehension, vocabuary and pronunciation. I listen to the CDs repeatedly when I work out. As a result, idioms, word order and ways of expressing ideas in Italian area seeming more natural to me. As a result, I feel confident carrying on conversations with my Italian friends. I am not tired of the set yet, and continue to get more and more out of it everytime I listen. Very meaty and helpful material. Great job!"
2,Too advanced,"I considered myself an intermediate to advanced speaker. Maybe I am only an intermediate speaker. The audio CD's phrases are too long, and the time provided to repeat is too short. The CD cover topics too quickly. There aren't enough examples in Italian to cover all the variations in any topic. There are two sets of CD's, one to use with the book at home, and the other to use on the go."
1,Give me a break,"I agree with the other guy... don't waste your money. Video (poor quality) contains information everyone knows (actually they are wrong on some things). A bunch of over educated nobodys psycho analyzing everything... And I mean everything. It's more about the ""nobodys"" opinions than anything else, and... who cares what they think? And, who the hell are these people? No new or clear footage. Bits and pieces briefly shown of old material. Worst video I've ever seen... If you're going to make a living off of other people's lives, at least do it with quality (lol)...How's that?"
4,great result but way to pricey for me.,"Really did like the product. Made my skin feel smooth and exfoliated. Problem is the cost. If used according to directions, it lasts only a weeks. If money is no object, go for it. It does work."
1,For people with extra money,Many cream available in Walmart or target for 5-10 bucks does the same job like this one.For mental satisfaction you can buy if you have extra money. Bye the way I used this whole bottle and going to go with Walmart stuff .
5,Great for budding musicians,"My 3 yo has been doing Little Musicians for 2 years & recently started learning the violin, she LOVES this book & asks for it over & over. Not only does it teach her the instrument names, but numbers too. I had never heard the term ""nonet"" before, but my little one now knows that means 9! Rhyming makes it entertaining & easy for her to remember, & she can recite much of the book. Vibrant, dynamic artwork with little animals to find on every page add further interest. Educational & lots of fun. A great introduction to the orchestra."
5,A keeper for the home library!,"When a friend enthusiastically recommended this book, I was intrigued by the title alone. Her fine literary taste was the second motivator for my search. We played it safe, and borrowed it from the library- now going on our third library loan. I decided that this was too good to keep borrowing, it belongs on my son's shelf permanently! If you want to share your love for words, music and class with your child, this book is worth having for keeps."
5,A great introduction,"I'll admit, I was not crazy about this one at first but my child loved it from the beginning. This is a great way to expose your kids to music and a number of different instruments beyond drums, guitar and piano. I highly recommend it."
4,Another fun book,"The story is great, and my son loves pointing out the different instruments. I would give it five stars but I hate the illustration style. It's downright ugly. I wish they would have went a completely different route with the style."
3,warning: PROG,"first of all, let me say that i apprehensively rate this album so low. there is a lot of good music here. just don't expect a lot of good psychadelia. this is a prog rock album, pure and simple. and that's not to say that i don't like prog. i do. it's just that this is very standard stuff, elevated only in moments--moments propelled mostly by arthur's great vocal style. but (and this is big) expect A LOT of hammond noodly bits. if you like elp, this album is ten times better. if you like rick wakeman, these guys are better. all of them are fine musicians; i was just expecting more psych and got progged instead. oh well. not worth buying if you don't like prog (but i do, so i'm ok, it's just i don't love prog--probably a five star must have if you need a hammond fix and have all the elp boots, gentle giant remasters and probably even checked out quartermass)."
1,Not a KISS,Paul Stanley has said many times this video has not been released by them. Why would you buy it if they do not authorize.
4,The title track carries the day,"I agree with other reviewers about the weakness of the shorter tracks here, but I must point out that the title track accounts for more than half the album's total running time ... and that track is fantastic. For pure, somber atmospherics, it's at the top of my Tangerine Dream list of songs. ""Green Desert,"" indeed; you sink into it like soft sand, then find that there is, after all, life in this landscape. The keyboard, percussion and guitar parts are all first rate, but what separates it from the rest of the album is that those individual parts add up to a fully realized musical composition. Sorry to say that's not true of the shorter pieces, which sound almost jarring after nearly 20 minutes of ""Green Desert"" itself. But it still rates four stars, easily."
3,Lackluster TD,"This release was shelved for a number of years before being released, and there is good reason. It is a fairly uninteresting disc of early 'classic' era TD, not bad, but certainly not up to the other releases of the era. Hard core fans will want to pick it up, but newcomers should pick up Phaedra, Rubycon, Encore or the Sorcerer soundtrack first."
3,Halfway Worthwhile,"The title track is an appealing landscape, albeit one traveled by early 70's Pink Floyd. Slow beat, fat drums under synthesizers, eventually a guitar solo. But it works. The other three tracks are rather weak silly cheery keyboard music."
2,Weak,"The title track is ""Floydesque"" and fairly compelling, but there's none of the classic, signature sounds TD was recognized for in ""Green Dessert"". It just sounds like a ... clone with little vision. ""White Cloud"" is pretty, but easily forgettable and ""Astral Voyage"" is just sequenced monotony to the Nth degree. Overall, it feels like a project slapped together out of indifference, then abandoned. ""Zeit"", ""Alpha Centuri"", ""Atem"" and ""Pheadra"" are far more interesting recording from the Tangerine Dream of that era. ANY one but this. Honest"
4,It's revelador,It is a magnific album. The album isn't representative of 70's works but is a glance of theirs creativity.
5,"Predesesser to Fanny Farmer's cook book- the ""real"" orignal","Mary Lincoln founded the Boston Cooking School. Her book contained the lessons and recipies. There are lessons on how to build a fire in a wood stove and explainations of proper diet for the ""sick room"" as well as a complete discussion on wheat, yeast and bread making. Learn ""how a new housewife without near neighbors"" can make her own yeast for her breadmaking. This was the first cookbook to use standardized measurements. In addition, the advertisments put an interesting historical perspective on many of our familiar brands. Mary Lincoln hired Fanny Farmer to be the school's principal. Fanny put out a second edition under her own name without any credit to Mary Lincoln...."
5,Great Book for a Coin Collector,I stumbled across this book while hunting for another one on Amazon and my son who has been an avid coin collector for a long time didn't have it. It made a great birthday gift!
3,Bearpaw rabbit fur boots,"These boots look great at first glance, however as you wear them a lot of problems arise. The fur sheds constantly on everything and the boots are very narrow where the fur joins the leather. Difficult to put on and take off. Would not recommend these."
1,CHEAP BOOTS.,"CHEAP!DO NOT BUY! Strings in front broke apart when I tried them on for the FIRST time. After only 10 wears, the Backseam ripped down the whole back of the right boot, I had to trash them after only having them for 1 MONTH! This is the WORST product I have EVER purchased! Due to the one month return limit, I could not return them. Hows that for Planned obsolescence!!!"
5,Great quality boots!,"These boots are adorable! My calves are about 13 in. around and when I get the boots on, I can also tuck in my jeans, although it takes a little effort, but it's worth it! I also like the fact that the fleece inside at the bottom of the shoe can come out, since I have some foot problems I like to put some special insoles in that are more comfortable for me when walking for longer periods of time. Comfortable to walk in, good traction on ice!"
3,go to the mukluk site and read about the fur they use,go to mukluk site and read about the fur they use and the no fur they use (and why)
1,NO FUR!!!!,"Anyone who buys these boots, should be ashamed. Go to [...] to see what really goes on when rabbits and other animals are stripped from their coats! alive!"
2,"Good fights and scenery, but nothing else to speak of","This is one of the cheapest movies I have seen in awhile. The costumes look good, and so does the scenery, but everything else feels so artificial. And it doesn't get anymore artificial than the storyline. From beginning to end there is not a single second where you would say to yourself ""hmm, this is interesting"". The only good thing about this movie is seeing all the cool locations where fights take place. In the final battle they are on a huge rock just next to the ocean. The fights are far from great, but not bad for 1971.2/5I got this in theKung Fu Crusade 10-packand the picture quality is good."
3,Case broken,"The spindle inside the case was broken, so the DVD was rattling around loose in shipment. It looks to have a slight scratch, but mostly it is ok. I haven't used the entire DVD yet with clients, but so far, so good, on the segments I have shown."
5,NUPE 1911,There needs to be a bit more explanation as to lining up the checks for printing. If you have the patience to work through the process it is quite easy to operate. I now make quick work of check printing.
4,check writer,The machine is easy to use. It has the feel of using a calculator. The machine is a little noisy in the printing process but otherwise it works fine.
3,This album is decent.He sounds as a mix of Scarface/Fat Pat,Mags voice is pretty tight but too simple. He should put a little more variety of vocab to make the album interesting. The song with Gangsta Boo along with the beat was the tightest.
2,Pretty weak movie...,"This is actually a Korean movie from 1969 called ""A Fierce Animal."" It stars Sa Mi-Ja as a blind swordswoman who is searching for her mother and uncle while being persued by a brothel owner. It has a decidedly cheap feel with poor fights and mediocre acting. This movie does not star Sonny Chiba, as has he been falsely credited on many sites."
4,Very good introduction to Darwin's works,"Ridley selected some of Darwin's most important passages from his various works- from ""Voyage of the Beagle"" to his well-known ""Origin of Species"". Although some of Darwin's original passages are a bit hard to read, Ridley does a great job in summarizing beforehand the aspects of each selection in the introductions to the passages. Ridley also points out some of the truths and misinterpretations made by Darwin without bias.If you want a compilation of Darwin's important passages in one book, or just a solid introduction to Darwin, his theories and works, this book will be sufficient for everyone."
3,Meh.,"The lighter takes a while to actually absorb the fluid to the point of use, and sometimes is still trouble to light afterward."
4,A great mix of soft and strong,"This is a quite original album,with a nice mix of death metal and goth influences. Tough,powerful chords with Raymond's doomsday growls and Liv Kristine's etheric voice combining to create a sound unlike any I've heard before. If you like Therion or Nordic death metal you should definately try this out."
5,Ireland Tour,"While trying to help a friend select an itinerary for a trip to Ireland, I stumbled upon this DVD and it is BRILLIANT! All of my favourite places that I'd recommend to someone visiting for the first time. Absolutely a brilliant armchair grand tour of my favorite place. Well worth the time and money, a DVD you'll come back to time and time again. Once you visit Ireland, you leave a part of yourself and keep coming back for more!"
3,Nice,As a person who's mother suffers from severe Alzheimer's disease I jumped to buy this book once I heard about it on NPR. The book offered me hope though in my case my mother was also a diabetic and couldn't handle the necessary dosages of coconut oil. Hopefully most other people will enjoy the full benefit of this information.
5,Love this book,This book was recommend to me in as much as I have several serious health issues. I would also recommend it to any and every one with health issues that do not have allergy to tree nuts. It is chocked full of great information.I haven't been on a routine long enough to have blood test results to back up any claims. I can say that it has increased my energy level and lowered my appetite and craving for sweets as well as carbs. So far I have great hopes following practices in the book and look forward to results. The book is easy to understand as well as follow and seems to be a common sense approach to holistic healing. Give it a try.
5,Terrific!,Learned a lot of what coconut oil can do and its many health benefits. Very good resource. Expanded my knowledge.
4,good book,"I just started reading this book, but so far it seems to be very thorough, not too clinical, and an easy read. The author goes into technical information about coconut oil properties, but is clear to say that you can skip over those areas if you don't understand or aren't interested. Can't wait to get further into the book. Seems really interesting."
5,Fantastic Book!,"Unbelievable! The lies we've been told for 20 years about saturated fats, how unhealthy it was for us, and how vegetable and soybean oils were the best option for overall health. After reading this book, I know why Americans, especially our kids, are so overweight! This book will open your eyes to what we've been missing out on all these years. Buy one for yourself and one for someone you care about."
3,Interesting Book,"Inspiring and offers coconut oil as a natural, affordable and good-tasting possible cure for many ailments and diseases. A very quick read with quite a few pages used up for recipes (some so simple they're unnecessary). My one disappointment in this book is it does not caution you that taking in the recommended amount can also result in diarrhea and vomiting. I speak from experience. Before I read the book, I had been taking in a lesser daily amount and was fine. After reading the book, I upped my intake and had two bouts of this ""cleansing"" experience. I told my husband ""I think it's the coconut oil."" Then he said he read that the ancient Hawaiians used coconut oil as a remedy for constipation. Well, folks, let me tell you it works!"
4,THe Miracle of Coconut Oil,"Was very impressed with this book. It does not contain the usual opinions of a person, the author has backed up his theories with extensive research. I did skim over a lot of the scientific stuff as the depth was a bit much for me. By the time I was a quarter of the way through the book I was convinced of the message. I like the recipes that are included and made coconut biscuits that were scrumptious. I have been using coconut in my cooking everyday now and it is easy to make the change. Having the difference explained between animal saturated fat and coconut fat was of interest to me. I do think that many health professionals just go with what is being said instead of properly checking the research themselves and thus we have a commercially born aversion to coconut oil. Easily written and a joy to read."
3,This review pertains to Kindle Edition Only,"This book was recommended by my healthcare provider, so I bought the Kindle edition to be able to read it immediately. The book itself is excellent, but the formatting for the Kindle edition is terrible:l. The tables are unreadable due to tiny font that does not enlarge when the typeface is increased.2. The indented first person accounts are not in same format as the main portion and have erratic spacing which makes them very difficult to read.The high cost of this Kindle edition is set by the publisher, not Amazon, but as a consumer I feel I have paid full cost for a defective product."
4,A great purchase!!!,"I bought the book out of curiosity and I am so glad I did. Not only it is amusing reading, it offers valuable information that may change one's life. I am now a coconut oil user and I am definitely experiencing positive changes in my health. I have substituted most (not all yet) of my cooking oils with coconut oil and feel great in all aspects. I also use it on my skin and hair and WOW!!! what a change. I would recommend the book because it may open a new set of options available to improve your health and well being. the recipes in the book are also good and simple.The Coconut Oil Miracle (Previously published as The Healing Miracle of Coconut Oil)"
5,The coconut Oil Miracle,I have learned so much about how Coconut oil can cure so many ailments. I've been able to let family and friends know of it's benefits and hopefully they pass along the information. Sometimes pills don't have to be the answer to our aches and pains try something natural!
3,Everything in moderation.........,"I liked the book. It's a little far fetched for me though. I will incorporate coconut oil into my diet but I am not going to down spoonfuls of the stuff every day, as the author suggests. Coconut oil is a natural God given substance but with all good things they should be used in moderation so they don't become bad.I have also been using it as a moisterizer for my feet and legs. I can't say that it is any better than any other product I have used."
3,Adkins? Really!,"I very much appreciate all the good work that Dr. Fife has done about coconut oil but he must be aware of the works of T Colin Campbell, Joel Fuhrman and John McDougall. How can he possibly suggest Adkins for advice on diet?! He has, I think, substantially discredited himself."
4,Coconut Oil Miracle,"Haven't had a chance to read the book yet, though I use the oil..So I know I'll like the book."
2,Many claims but some are pure hype,Book reads like a commercial and is not especially an interesting read (but then I've only managed to slog through less than half of it so far). Snake oil drummers made similar claims about miracle cures. Coconut oil is a misnomer since it is more like lard than oil.
5,Coconut Oil Miracle,Well written. Great information about the virtues of coconut oil. Once touted as being unhealthy coconut oil has many uses and benefits.
5,Coconut Oil - Great Book,This is a great book for anyone who wants to improve their health. It is well written and easy to read. I have switched my family over to using coconut oil in cooking. There are some recipes in the back to help you on your way. I highly recommend this book.
5,Coconut oil,I recommended this book to several of my friends and family. Several are now using coconut oilto cook with and on their skin.The book covers the history of coconut oil and how widely it was used in the 50's and 60's.If you want to eat healthy then read this book.
3,do I have this book?,I do not know that I have this book.I cannot rate it but I am a believer in the great goodness of coconut
1,HYPE !,"After reading this book, I am convinced coconut oil is no miracle and there is a lot of hype about it.Many of the authors recipes are full of sugar .Not exactly healthy!And to not even mention in the recipe for mayonaise for a person to know there source is safe when using raw egss is reckless.It wasn't that long ago here in the USA than many eggs were being recalled because people had gotten sick after eating them."
3,Repetitive,"I was excited to get this book, as I had hoped that it would provide me with a bit more information on the benefits of coconut oil use, than I had been able to find online. While it is written in a way that is easily understood, once you've read the first 1/3 of the book, you've pretty much read all there is to read. The rest of the book tends to repeat itself, as if it's a hard sell on coconut oil. Sadly, I did not find any new information in this book either."
5,Excellent book,"This book contains a lot of information that is mostly unknown to the public, due largely to the politics involving powerful agribusiness interests in this country. (I'd really like to give it only 4-1/2 stars, however, due to the poor editing.) Learn about what is probably one of the healthiest oils you can consume, and yet has become difficult to find in grocery stores. And it's sad to learn that we've been pushing less-healthful oils (corn, soy, etc.) on developing countries as a replacement for their coconut oil, with the result that the people there are suffering more degenerative disease. The author has also written a book called Eat Fat Look Thin, which details a low-carbohydrate coconut diet to help with weight loss."
4,Very thorough,"I am slowly reading ths densely packed information full history of Thailand. It gives all sorts of clues asto how the Thai people have become the nation they are.strong rec for those who have time to plough through little known to most westerns, Asian history"
3,Unbalanced but still worth reading,"I, too, wish that the author had devoted more time to the 20th. century. 200-year-old palace intrigues just don;t have the same zing as the more contemporary-and equally scandalous-intrigues from our own time. Still, there's material here that you'll find nowhere else and, if you can pick up a copy you'll find it an enjoyable read.Godfree Roberts, [...]"
2,Until a Better History Comes Along--This Is It,"I bought this book in preparation for my first trip to Thailand. I was hoping for a readable overview of Thailand's history to enhance my stay. Unfortunately, I came away less than satisfied with Wyatt's book. It was long and tedious. His writing style is pedantic and dull. The author clearly knows his subject well, but his treatment of Thai history was long on details, presented chronologically, but short on interpretation. Surprisingly, there was little in the book about how Buddhism affected the course of historical events. After finishing the book as the plane touched down in Bangkok, I had assimilated a number of important facts about Thailand, but I didn't feel that the book gave me the chance to understand the sweep of Thai history. Yet, my research did not find any other book in English which covers the subject. Until one comes along, hopefully a better one, I guess this is it."
4,Aptly titled,"The title says it all, ""A short history."" Overall not a bad read, though one walks away feeling somewhat less than satisfied. Particularly interesting is the history of palace intrigues during the 18th and 19th centuries. One wishes the author had devoted as much effort to the chapters concerning 20th century Thailand as he did to these era, particularly World War II era Thailand, and Thailand struggles with democracy (and the many coups) in the latter half of the century. Still, this is one of the better books of a limited number devoted to the fascinating history of the realm."
2,"Very dull reading, not up-to-date","Undoubtedly, the author knew Thailand and its history extremely well! This unfortunately is only necessary but not sufficient to write a readable book.The author faithfully recounts which king invaded what place when, he tells us the outcome of that battle.....The book does not tell us at all, how the people lived, what their social behaviour was, etc. In other words, the reader does not get a feel for how life was.The period fron the 80's onward is poorly covered. The fist edition was published in 1980 or so, and the overhaul it got in 2002 by the author was insufficient in my view.This is not a book, I recommend."
3,Just OK,"The trim on my recessed lights needed some updating. These fit fine, and were easy to install. The issue I had with them is that the glass they use dims the light output when compared to the older Halo trim that was there. To remedy, I had to buy some of those super bright CFL daylight bulbs. With a regular bulb, the glass defuses too much of the light. It is what it is, I guess."
5,Perfect fit,I had to replace the rather old and worn recess light trim in my condo. Unfortunately the recessed lights were square so finding a good replacement was a bit of a challenge. This product was a perfect solution else I would have had to replace the entire canister with a modern one.
4,"Amusing, thin, mostly right, but fails with many stereotypes","Amusing, if thin, book on France and the French. It is about 60% accurate, but is limited by its editorial raison d'etre of placing everyone in a Frog box. Many French are very much like those described in this book, but let's face it, all French aren't. France is a complex society with a complex history on an amazing piece of soil and with a multi-tribal origins. Basques like me are not like the long-boned Normans or the Celtic Bretagnes, and we all have funny accents to each other. Told from a British perspective, so unless you are tuned into Briticisms some of this will be lost on an American audience. But again, much of the content doesn't get past the intellectual level of ""The Simpsons"" in depth, but still every other page has something that makes you chuckle.Note: this is not a guide book...it is a long editorial about points of French behaviour and culture."
3,No joie de vivre,The Xenophope's Guide to the French is a review of French attitudes towards different aspects of life. It'sdiscussion is rather abstract. It appears to be describing the attitudes of upper middle class people from Paris. From this book it is difficult to figure out how you should behave or what you should say in typical tourist or business situations to be on good terms with the French people you deal with. Perhaps these behaviours are not decribed because it is almost impossible for foreigners to be on good terms with Parisians; I found the Parisians to be actively hostile to me even though I was speaking French. But this book does not have a lot of helpful information on good interactions with French people.
5,best tartar sauce ever,"I cook a lot of fish as I live at the beach. This is one of the rare bottled sauces I use and everyone loves it! Therefore, I buy it by the case. Just add: capers, parsley and lemon juice and you won't believe the flavor!"
3,color way off,"i got the mocha color, but it is way off from the pic online. it is so much darker, does not look as nice as the picture at all!"
1,sad looking jacket,this cheap sad looking jacket was supposed to be a gift for my bro...i hated it the very sight..worse i had no time to return it as i was making a trip...and had to keep it.
5,Item discountinued in department stores,"I was very happy to find I could get my favorite perfume still at Amazon. When I recently tried to purchase Ralph Rocks in the department store, they told me it was discontinued but to check online, so I did. Amazon had it!"
5,this is the ultimate!!!,awesome value for this wonderful smelling fragrance...all ages would love to wear it...I am still wondering how it can last for so long-I get compliments every day!!!!
1,Swaped,I ordered Ralph Rocks which has been my favorite for many years. When I got it I opened it up and right away I noticed a different cap on it. When I sprayed the perfume I know right away that it was not Ralph Rocks. They put a different perfume in the Rocks bottle. I am very upset. DO NOT ORDER from this company!!!!!
1,defective,I received this product and it had leaked and was only 3/4 full. I sent an e mail but have heard no reply :(
4,I wish they shipped to Hawaii :(,"I LOVE this perfume and I get compliments on it all the time.. I was so sad when I found out they discontinued it in retail stores, however I found that perfume outlets like perfumania and etc., still sell the smaller 1.7oz size. I love the way the smell changes overtime, but it still has a really beachey/summery kick to it. I've been wearing this perfume ever since it came out in 2007.. I am so sad that amazon can't ship it to Hawaii, since the stores here only sell the 1.7 oz, and its almost as much as the 3.4 oz on amazon!...p.s I've tried ""Ed Hardy by Christian Audigier"" (the one in the pink bottle w/ skulls and hearts that say ""LOVE KILLS SLOWLY"") and it's my current replacement while I look for another ralph rocks... if you like Ralph rocks, you might like that Ed Hardy perfume... just a tip.. :)"
1,It's tricky.,It does not work with anything higher than windows XP. And is tricky to install. I did not understand the instructions. There were to many typos to count.
1,No good,"Never got it to work with any video capture software.You can oly get one video plug to work, and no way to switch between cameras."
3,Three inputs - Only one works,"Card is recognized but there is no selector in the app or driver for switching between RCA jacks. I had hoped to put two video cameras on this and share the converter at least. Cannot get the others to work. Win XP SP3 and a dual Intel Core 2, 1TB HD, 2 GB dual channel Ram."
4,Complicated,"This book has too many characters. You have the assassin, the girl, the girl's boyfriend, the girl's father, the girl's grandmother, the FBI paid man, the cop, the cop'd FBI friend...it goes on for a while. If you can keep the characters straight I believe you will like this book. It intertwines several story lines into a twisting thriller concerning the North Korean government, life in Japan and pachinko gambling halls. The chapters are short and interest catching. It's easy to get into and, I've found, easy to put down and pick up again while still being aware of what is going on."
4,Prety Darn Amazing,"I am a big fan of Joe Satriani and loved what Stu did on his Live in San Francisco DVD (not just the solo, the entire performance) so I thought I had to give this album a shot.Going from some of Jo's newest stuff to this 1980's solo album was a big jump but all up I was quite blown away. I have heard Stu do a lot of amazing tap work but both his tapping and slapping on 'Sexually Active' and the entire album is just incredible - highly inspiring.I admit that I don't have many bass solo albums but I was truly inspired with what Stu does on this one. Highly recomended for bassists. Would be good to see how he does it all actually, can't wait for a Stu Hamm DVD!PS - it was interesting to see that the bass solo on the Joe Satriani Live in San Francisco album was mostly based around 'Moonlight Sonata' and 'Country Music' off this album!"
1,scam,this book is a scam. Written by someone who was very good with using the 'copy' and 'paste' functions. A 5 year-old child could attain all this info by googling the most basic and obvious terms; the search terms are still even bolded in the text- evidence of the author's inability to even correct the font type. Written likely by some Russian nationals in the DC area who hung up on me when i called them. There are absolutely no citings or references of the stolen-texts that make up this abomination. THIS BOOK SERIOUSLY SUCKS!!! AVOID AT ALL COSTS!!!
3,"""some "" assembly required!",These items are VERY tricky to assemble. The instructions are cryptic and not helpful.Be ready for a frustrating experience!
5,Outdoor with class,"I bought a complete eight peace sectional seating for my patio. This furniture is everything I was wanting, low cost, good quality and good style. The cushions are very nice and comfortable. The parts are some what time consuming to assemble, but it's not bad. I would recommend a ratchet alien wrench not the provided alien wrench; it will kill your fingers. I would recommend this sectional seating to anyone. I just now need to get some nice pillows for it and it will be complete. 100 % HAPPY"
5,Wonderful and great price!,"I purchased this about two weeks ago and love it - the construction is super solid, I had no issues with the delivery of the item, and setup was relatively easy for two adults. Hint: make sure you put in the bolts for the front pieces first though - hard to see, but there is a hard to see bolt!My only wish is that there was an option other than white - but the cushions are super comfy."
3,Material on cushions are hard to clean,"I purchased 6 pieces of this set and within a year, the cushions got dirty from feet and normal use that we had to try toi clean them. They did not clean up. We tried dyeing them but in then end it did not look the way we want. This set is at my home in forida and stays undercover all of the time and does not get wet. I needed new cushions and could not find a replacement other then ordering them fom the same company in a different color. When I went to order i noticed that the price of the cusions are 75% of the cost of the entire chair/cushion combo. It bugged ,e to think that that they are selling chairs for $249.00apx with cushions, but to replace the cusion its $150-$240 for just the cushion. Are they selling the chairs cheaper knowing that peopl will have to replace cushions and the only ones that fit are sold by them.The furniture itself is sturdy and looks great, just be concerned about the cushions."
4,Great Value,"We had looked at similar patio sectional systems and this on was by far the best value. The furniture is sturdy and looks great. I wish we had other options for the cushions, as these dirty quickly, but all in all, we atre very pleased."
2,Cushions quickly rot in damp weather,"After assembling, the furniture looked great. Unfortunately, within days after first use the cushions were dirty and difficult to clean (unlike other cushions I have had outside). Then within another week or so, the cushions got extremely bad mildew and needed to be tossed. Now I need to decide whether or not to buy cushions every year and worry about moving them to storage whenever they are not in use. I would not recommend you buy this furniture unless you live somewhere extremely dry. Very disappointed."
1,Corner seat fail to assemble,"The armless and ottoman assemble quite easily and the shipping box stamped ""certified frustration free""The corner chair however does not have the ""certified frustration free"" stamp and it failed to assemble. The sitting board does not fit into the L shape frame. It was off by 3mm - hardslamming will not work with that discrepancyAlso the packing is poor, the corner of the side boardThe arc of the backboard also doesn't match with the armless chairThe worst about buying furniture online is the return process, but I had to return it instead of taking the discount option. I think I am going to replace it with another armless to make sure that I don't have to return the second time"
5,great presenation box,"I bought the box to use for my portfolio case. Had matboard cut to size and then used photo corners to mount my presentation pieces. It's nice size, and fits perfectly in my carryon luggage. My only problem with this order was that the shipping was late and it took a few phone calls to Calumet before they resolved this problem. I'd still order from them again, though, the product is that good."
1,hate it,"since I have arthritis and it's difficult for me to hook a bra in the back, thought I would give this one a try. It does not fit well ... cups are loose and the band is tight ... it actually cuts into the flesh. I bought it a size bigger than I normally wear because I had been told by a friend that Glamorize is cut small. I hate this bra and it is going into the donation bin at our local thrift shop in the hopes that someone will like it and get some good out of it."
1,glamorise bra,"Have other Glamorise bras that I love. This one was thrown in the trash the 1st day. It was a poor fit and actually pressed my breast like I was having a Mammogram. Wasn't worth the effort to send back. Sorry Glamorise, hope you can do better than this."
1,Terrible for larger sizes,"This bra runs incredibly small. I am between an F and G, so I ordered size G cup and it was as small as DDD. The band size was okay and it does technically fit. The support is average at best for my size. Somehow, it manages to give the pointed torpedo shape and uniboob at the same time. The band rolls up and there is only about 1/3 inch of adjustment in the band. I'm incredibly disappointed and will never wear it again, let alone buy another one."
2,Wonderful engineering is not enough to make up for shoddy materials,"I bought two Glamorise bras, they fit well and at first I was delighted. I treated them extremely gently, washing in gentle cycle and with cold water only. Within just a few months, the hooks on the bra literally began to disintegrate. You couldn't get them to go through the eyes.Another drawback is that the fabric is cheap and scratchy and becomes more so with repeated washing. Despite the stiffness and scratchiness, the fabric does not hold it's shape--the great fit deteriorates along with everything else.The bras were great at first but became progressively less so with each washing and became completely unwearable when the fasteners disintegrated.Sorry, I really wanted to like these bras. I wish somebody would take the basic design and use good materials--that ought to make a great bra."
3,Robo soul search,"For fans of early experimental ambient, all TD's first phase work would probably keep interest, but music fans looking for the group's prime organic output would hold out for their next, often considered greatest release- the reason being of course this idea-heavy, fragmented work merely hints at production cohesion which was to follow."
2,Worst Classic Dream,"I liked the first 5-or-so minutes of the opener which evokes some Egyptian pyramid. Then it transitions into mediocre fare, and the next two songs continue the mediocrity. The last song, with the horrendous vocals, was thankfully a one-time experiment! ""Alpha Centauri"", ""Green Desert"", and ""Zeit"" are much better early TD. On the other hand, maybe the new remastered version will reveal the songs in a better way."
2,Atmospheric but Empty,"Early 70's Pink Floyd is evoked and outright copied here on the first two tracks. ""Circulation of Events"" is a worthwhile piece of dissonent electronic music, foreboding and pulsing. ""Wahn"" is strange manipulation of vocals straight out of Pink Floyd's ""Several Species of Small Furry Animals ..."" off ""Ummagumma"". Highly derivative."
3,cobblers,"I really wish there were more shoemakers that worked with manmade materials in the world. I can always find cheap shoes that are manmade, but I worry about glue and such - cruelty free is essential to me. I think there are more designers out there with alternatives might be worth checking out. It would be neato if we could buy cruelty-free anywhere. Pain for beauty - not really worth it. I'd like a book that celebrates cruelty-free shoes, though this one looks interesting enough."
3,ok,"I thought it was very interesting, I would like to find out more about other books. Please send me more books about this subject."
2,A quick overview of the shoe,"A quick overwiew of the shoe's history and lore, but it is not nearly as insightful as some of the other books that are available on shoes. I love shoes and collect them as fervently as the other readers of the book, but I didn't find it as fabulous as say, the book by Colin McDowell, which offers information that is more intriguing. I think what everyone loves about this book is the small size. But the really cool info about shoes is to be found elsewhere."
3,"Ehhh, for the price, you might as well get it","First off, I hate the size of this book. It's not enjoyable to look through.Yes, this book is full of many many shoes. However, a lot of them are ugly ugly ugly. You will find inspiration though. I hoped to see more modern designs in here, like Nichloas Kirkwood or Pierre Hardy, but I neglected to see that it was published 15 years ago."
3,Good basic info...,"As a soon-to-be puppy parent I enjoyed reading this book, it had a lot of good information about the breed, but it shouldn't be the only one you read if you plan to get a Weim. In addition to other dog books, I would strongly recommend the one called ""How to Speak Dog"" to anyone who plans to get a dog or already has one."
5,If you like Tangerine Dream...,"If you like this album by Tangerine Dream (one of thier best works) - try also their CD of same period - ""Underwater Sunlight"" (1986)."
5,If..,"Finally an album from the prog-rap scene gets some decent attention. If you can try to find both of the Greenthink albums from a couple of years ago, they're nice teasers for this one. Amazing album..also get The Fog, Mush Comp, Aesoprock, Sonic Sum and Shapeshifter LP's."
4,Music To Do Whip-its By,"I really enjoyed this record. I actually didn't get hip to the Clouddead till after Ten but I found this on vinyl recently and decided to check it out. I like this much more than Ten. Althought the production is a lot more low-fi it makes for a much more interesting palate of sounds. In a lot of ways this is the signiture Clouddead sound, the muddled beats, the harmonized rhymes, and the psycadelic avante guard excursions (which I realize are off putting to most). However, these singles are excellent rainy-day-sitting-around-the-crib-rolling- trees type music. I usually end my reviews by recommending the record to people who may also be into similar bands but, I cannot think of any band that sounds too much like these guys. So I'll end it simply by saying that I recommend this record if your looking for a hip-hop record that sounds like nothing else."
1,An insult to his art,"I wish I had read the customer reviews before buying this record in which case I would have learned what I know now without the expense. I listened to a few bars of the first few songs and they are so terrible (toneless, wobbling, flat in pitch and feeling etc) that I stopped listening and have consigned the album to the dustbin. Endrigo at his heighth was Jacques Brel with italian guts, a fabulous performer and writer. This album does him no good and I am sorry it was published. Buyers: Read these reviews and hope that the original albums will be reissued. And about this album, we can borrow one of Endrigo's titles: Basta Cosi'."
2,Deceptive,I just purchased this board on sale for 44.99. not at all worth the purchase. board looks aged and faded. would not recommend.
3,Solid but damaged,"I have not complaints about the dartboard itself, but it came damaged (the side and back were crushed in). I don't know if that is the fault of the carrier or the supplier. It was not damaged enough for me to return it."
2,Very Disappointed.,"We've purchased at least a dozen sets of Woodstock Chimes over the years, (from Amazon and elsewhere...) And have always been delighted by them.They are a quality product and some of the best sounding wind chimes available on the market.But, this particular model was a disappointment. Two of the strings that held up the individual chimes have broken, sending the chimes crashing to the ground.And while we had them hanging outside,(of course) they were not directly exposed to the elements. This particular set was kept under the screened in overhang by our front door, protecting them from rain and squirrels and such... And yet still, the stings have broken.What a shame.They produced a delightful sound with even the most gentle of breezes, and now two of the ""notes"" are gone.This will make me think twice before ordering another set of Woodstock chimes."
4,Lovely chimes,"I bought these because I heard a clip of them on the Woodstock Chimes website. I liked the deep tone and thought they would be nice in the yard. Now that I have them, I am considering buying a second pair. They do require a somewhat stiff breeze to be activated, but they have a lovely sound."
1,DO NOT BUY!!!,I have two DeWalt 36v batteries and after two years of mild use they will no longer take a charge. DeWalt advertises that you should be able to get 2000 charges out of these batteries. I got at the most 50. This is flawed technology. I'm now stuck with 800 dollars worth of useless tools.
1,Dead right from the start - Defective with NO SUPPORT!,"Bought the large combo kit. The first battery lasted about 10 minutes, and then nothing. The second battery never worked at all. Now both give me the ""3 rapid blinking lights"" indicating dead batteries. No help from Amazon, and none from Dewalt. I own so much Dewalt equipment, I don't want to begin to count them. But when something like this happens, it tarnishes their reputation to me so badly that I have serious doubts I would ever buy one of their products again. Now I have a $1000 investment that, just like these batteries...is TRASH."
1,36 Volt Dewalt Batteries,"These, are the worse Batteries I have ever seen in Battery Electric Drills etc. I have one of the very first 18 volt kit drills with 2-18 volt batteries 10 years old or more, and they still work. I bought 2- batteries in 36 volt about a year ago and one of them is already giving the rapid 3- blinking lights in charger and completely dead. I have used them very little, it looks mint. So quit doing your crooked advertising stating how good these batteries are, they sure do not last longer. Too damn expensive in the first place and terrible realiability. Complaints all over the internet, so don't say have never heard of this problem. I have friends in carpentry and electrical business that have had Makita and Milwaukee tools that have had batteries that have also lasted 10 plus years...."
4,DeWalt warranties these batteries,I'm not sure why other people had problems with DeWalt customer service. A representative from DeWalt was kind enough to replace my batteries. I hope they last longer this time.
1,pawning off expired batteries,"This isn't the first 36 volt battery I've bought from Amazon that didn't work. Every one I've bought hasn't worked. At first I thought it was my charger, but after talking to DeWalt, they said to check the date code stamped into the plastic. They were all 2006! These batteries are no good after 4 years, so they sold me expired batteries. Amazon hit me with email which I couldn't ignore and asked me to review my purchases, so here you are. If I knew how to return it (which I suppose I could find out) I would, but I have little to no time. Any quick route to a return?"
4,Fine battery,"Not much to say, I got a 36v tool set and decided to get an extra battery. It is quite expensive, but does the job. I hope it lasts for years. I got a Dewalt 18v lithium battery awhile ago that was DOA - unfortunately, I didn't open that one until after the warranty had expired - lesson learned and now I make sure that any spare battery I buy works."
5,One of the most remembered TV shows,"I got this DVD for Christmas, in Davy Crocket King of the wild frontier has Davy Crocket Indian Fighter, Davy Crocket goes to Congress, and Davy Crocket at the alamo together in one movie. In Davy Crocket and the River Pirates has both Davy Crocket and the kelboat race, and Davy Crocket and the River Pirates together in one movie. This is good for all families. Buy this DVD."
5,Heroes,Fess Parker played two of this countries greatest men in two different centuries. These two movies were great to watch.
2,Movies worse than I remembered,Would have preferred to rent these. Will probably be a donation to charity before the year is out. Wish I had my $10 back...
2,Davy Crockett,I can see why only two episodes were made. Terrible acting. Daniel Boone was with fess Parker was a much better series..
3,Davy Crockett,"My Grandson loves the movie, but I thought when it was a two movie set it would be two different movies I got two of the same movies. I'm not sure why? But that's OK I will put one in the car and one at home."
5,Disney Classic. FUN,"Other reviewers have reviewed the plots and the history of this movie many times over so there is no need for me to tell you more about where this movie came from and about it's plot.This is not a historically acurate movie. It wasn't when it was made and it is even less so know with the dated ideals it shares about some of the events back in Davey Crocket's time. It is, at times, politically uncorrect. Despite that, or maybe because of that, this movie is pure Disney adventure fun.After watching this my son did what many young boys have done, got himself a coonskin cap and a fake rifle and went around exploring the world.This is a fun movie with lots of laughs, a little bit of drama, a little bit of history and a lot of adventure.Enjoy."
4,Davey Crockett 2 Movie DVD Set,A great step back in time to the late 50s watching Disneyland on a Sunday evening. Not sure why the Alamo is the first disc! Fade outs were a bit annoying but hey this is pushing 60 years of age.
1,"BUYER BEWARE. This product is NOT ""Tear Free""!! It irritated my toddler's eyes","Upon using this product as a shampoo, my toddler rubbed his eyes quite a lot during and after the bath. He became upset and wanted to get out of the bath, which he normally enjoys. Later, trying the product myself as a test-- it irritated my eyes!! This product is not ""Tear Free,"" and will likey irritate your child's eyes. It's unconscionable that Burt's Bees are marketing this as a baby product."
2,A Christmas bust,"I had seen this film several years ago at the theater, thus my desire to obtain it. I should have known with an older DVD there would be problems. While attempting to watch the movie with two friends whom had never seen it. The picture often jumped and blurred in spots, etc. It was a very disappointing viewing :("
4,"Sad movie, very moving. (Mix up with kids animation with the same title)","I saw this movie on TV in the mid-seventies. It was dubbed in English from the original French. I must have been about ten or eleven at the time. It moved me a lot and made a big impact on me. Now, many years later, I remembered it and Googled cancer, radiation, christmas and wolves and good old Google found it for me in about two seconds. So now I'm here on Amazon trying to buy it. Problem is, there's some animated kids movie called ""The Christmas Tree"" as well, and it's getting totally mixed up in the sales and availability with the William Holden movie that I want. I'm afraid to buy it and have them send me the wrong thing. Also, it appears the movie I want is only available on VHS. I haven't dusted off the old VHS player for probably 8 or 9 years. (It's on a shelf in the closet next to an 8-track tape player and a Colecovision. LOL)"
1,Wrong movie,"I have ordered many items through the Amazon.com website and always been satisfied with my purchases, but during the Christmas holidays I ordered an old movie called ""The Christmas Tree"" with William Hollman and received a movie called ""Classic Christmas Tales."" Unfortunately, I ordered this movie from my sister's home and did not save a copy or my order. So I am unable to return this movie to the seller. When I received the envelope, it had a P.O.B number and I was unable to return the wrong movie to a P.O.B.. So I am stuck with the wrong movie...any suggestions to return this movie? Please let me know. cjc"
4,Be aware! SOLD IN PAIRS,These are great replacements. I would like to alert all potential buyers that these are SOLD IN PAIRS. I did not know this and now have an extra set.
3,hoped it would be better.,"seems like a bad re-mix of 'mixed up'. after just a few songs, the vocals sound like the same person. i suppose if you love techno, this might do it for you. song selection is hit n miss, but that's what you get with any tribute cd. buy it used/cheap if you're buying"
3,Have a Heart!,"I purchased this clock for my husband for strictly sentimental reasons. I would have liked it to be a little larger, but the quality is ok and it keeps accurate time. He is very happy with it and keeps it on his bedside table so he can see it every day."
5,A lot of fun to watch,"This is one for the English teachers out there. The film takes a Shakespeare play [Richard III] and adapts it to a contemporary setting. Anyone who loves Shakespeare will enjoy watching how the plot line is used here. The actors all seem to be relishing their over the top perfomances...but isn't that one of the charms of the original character? I think yes. Buy this one, show it to your students, and discuss how Shakespeare borrowed from other sources."
2,JUST A GANGSTA FLICK THAT HAPPENS TO HAVE A SHAKESPEARE PLOT,"A YOUNG LATINO THUG [JON SEDA] BETRAYS HIS OWN BROTHERS ONE BY ONE SO THAT HE CAN CONTROL THE STREETS OF LA. THE ACTING IS OK, BUT, THE PLOT IS MEDIOCRE AND THE MOVIE'S JUST NOT ALWAYS ON TARGET. I THINK THIS MOVIE IS BETTER THAN MOST OF THE GANGSTA MOVIES THAT'RE CURRENTLY AT THE VIDEO STORES RIGHT NOW, BUT, THIS MOVIE NEEDS SOME SERIOUS WORK. THAT'S RIGHT, THIS MOVIE ACTUALLY IS AN URBAN REWORKING OF ''RICHARD III'', THE CLAASIC SHAKESPEARE STORY. IF YOU'RE INTERESTED, RENT IT. BUT DON'T BUY IT."
2,Worth it for the hotties!,"I thank the last reviewer for mentioning the Shakespearean influence. I kept wondering why the protagonist kept making such unrealistic soliloquies. Anyway, this movie had a terrible plot. The way in which a brother was killing his own brothers was very disheartening. It shifted the border from US-Mexico to Northern Cal-Southern Cal for some unexplained reason. Still, this movie was worth it for one reason: THE GUYS IN IT ARE KILLER HOT!!!! Que guapos! Almost every male character wears sleeveless undershirts to displaying their perfect torsos and sculptured arms. Simply beautiful!"
5,"If You're Looking for Facts, Check the Britannica","This slim, beautiful little volume is very satisfying if you are looking to enjoy the beauty of mermaids. It does not have a lot of ""facts"" but why would you be searching for facts about mermaids when they inhabit the nebulous realm of magic? This book contains 49 full color illustrations of mermaids, some of the more famous ones like Waterhouse's and Pyle's are included, but so are many that you probably will not have seen before. Ratisseau is a brilliant compiler and she has outdone herself here with super research and a flair for the subject. The text consists of many wonderful quotes, again, some famous and some obscure. The page lay-outs are tasty and most of the illustrations have a luminous sea-blue border around them, all printed on quality paper and perfect for gift-giving or for treating yourself."
3,"Ahhh,this is definitly a 3 star book!","This book is not that great in information, but the pictures and drawings are great! The detailing and description on this short and simple book, is incredible. I wouldn't recommend this to people who are looking for facts on mermaids or anything remotely like so, but it makes a great book to sit in front of a fire and look through while listening to calm music."
5,For Mermaid Lovers,If you love Mermaids you must own a copy of this book! This book is so sweetly put together. The images were carefully chosen; so beautiful and elegant. Ratisseau did an exquisite job. Her Fairies book is just as lovely too. One will also like Lori Eisenkraft-Palazzola's books too if they like this one.
3,Nice coffee table book,"I bought this book to help me with my M.F.A. thesis about femme fatale, mermaids and beauty.I thought it was a lovely book for what it is, simple with little stories and poems, but it is not really scholarly. There is not much information, but a lot of legends and texts. Obviously the research to make that book was really good. The images are BEAUTIFUL. Don't expect information though, cause there is none."
4,mermaids,"beautiful book, it had great pictures and nice poetry (though not heavy on the info it was very well composed) I strongly recomend it to those looking for a coffie house style book with good pics"
2,small book,"This book was a disapointment. Very small with 36 pages of art work mostly from the turn of the century. Most of the mermaids were very anemic looking with overly sexual poses. Good quality paper in book, but pictures just too small. I bought this for inspiration for my art, it was not. I was looking for a book of gorgeous art work with mythical creatures from the sea."
2,Little Eyes Beware,"Very good historical information of mermaids....but did not give the book to my young child because of the nudity featured in the artwork. The artwork is indeed classical, beautiful, and very sensual."
5,"Sexy, Superb & Sublime..............","I absolutely love chill/lounge music and this has GOT to be one of the most groovy, diverse ones out there. I am not sure how I actually came by it but I am surprised more people have not reviewed and/or snatched it up. This CD gets constant rotation in my car and everyone who hears it likes it!The genre's which are touched up are soul, jazz, blues, reggae, R&B; all with a very sensual, sexy chill vibe which can't be beat!"
4,Very nice story,"I really liked it-it's such a nice fantasy movie.You have to watch it!Also,I've got a question for you guys-does someone know anything about the song in the movie?It's fantastic.I know it's called ""The two of us will always be one"",but I'm wondering about the performer.If someone knows,please write back!"
5,the snow queen,"the snow queen spins a tail of the intensitiy of innocent love the the lenght some would go to for that love. it tells the story of a father , his daughter. how they deal with loss of the love of power, the lenghts one goes to to achieve what they desire the most- the daughter, the queen, the bear....a inspirational moving tale."
4,Good Family Move,This is a good family move. One of the TV stations in our area split it into a 2 day move. Our DVR did not get the 2nd part. We just had to get our hand on this move to see how it ended.
2,More Like....Drag....Queen of the Snow,"The lavish budget did provide many beautiful costumes, sets, and location scenery, but the simplicity and innocence of Hans Christian Andersen's fairy tale got lost in three hours of paper-thin acting, a very poor screen play, dreadful dialog, bad film editing and lousy direction from David Wu."
1,Indescribably boring and pathetic.,"This film deserves an award for one of the worst ever made. It is about two and a half hours too long and simply lacks a plot - it is an insult to the memory of Hans Christian Andersen. The acting was pretty awful as well. I did wonder whether the entire cast and crew were suffering from the effects of several illegal substances - perhaps driven to using them by the sheer banality of the plot (I use the term loosely). If you have not seen it my advice is to avoid it altogether. It is not one of those films that is ""so bad that it is good"", it is just bad."
2,Not What I Expected,"I was disappointed in this film. It was too long. The entire middle section of this movie was too drawn-out and slow-paced. The beginning was great and the ending got me a little excited, but overall I wouldn't recommend this film."
2,THE SCARY QUEEN!,"I agree with a previous review that this movie was too long. The story was too drawn out. As far as the Snow Queen was concerned, she needed a valium to calm her down and possibly help with her quicksilver mood swings. The polar bear was a creative idea, but why was he there? and why did he turn into a human in the end? I did enjoy the love story, but the young man didn't seem to get a grasp on who he wanted. Add the heroine with her journey to get her love back, and this three hour production became very frustrating for the characters and the audience. The love story seemed rushed, if it could be rushed in three hours, and a bit unbelievable. I felt they should have developed that more and maybe edited the Fall Queen's story, or even the long drawn out scenes with the Snow Queen. Ultimately, this movie was a disappointment to me. I was looking for something with more emotional substance. If you agree, try watching Snow White. It is a wonderful story."
1,A pathetic attempt,"I saw this movie when it debuted on Hallmark. I wouldn't spend a half penny to buy it. While the wintry scenery is enjoyable, the plot fails quickly and the film is buried up to its eyebrows in poor acting. The spirit of winter comes out looking like a sadistic, homocidal sociopath with possible nymphomanical tendencies (ex. kidnapping Kai and constantly attempting to seduce him). The heroine is weakly portrayed and her supposed love for Kai is never demonstrated to any level higher than infatuation. The film is far too long; with the commercials, it ran for four hours. I stayed up till midnight only out of morbid curiosity to see how it might just possibly end. It's also intriguing how the writer tries to make Satan appear to be the cause of seasonal change. All in all, this movie is pathetic. It only deserves one star, and that only because of the efforts put in by the set designers."
5,A Love Story Within,"I thought that this movie was awesome! A total must see for anyone who believe's in true love. I thought that at the beginning when Kai and Gerda first fell in love was the best part of the movie. And as she is going through all this trouble to find him, you can tell that she is determined and that she really loves him. ... It's a great plot, and the snow queen is excellent!! She brings the character to life. ... I Love this Movie!"
1,"Single, white, female...",but's she's no Snow Queen. What a disgrace to Hans Christian Andersen! A horrible attempt at a beautiful classic. One star is too generous.
5,Buying Videos,I was very pleased with this purchase. It was a Christmas gift for mydaughter.I recieved it in excellant condition and very quickly.
4,Snow Queen...,"Hallmark is good at these. I got this at Music Recyclery awhile back hoping it was a take on Marvel's/Alpha Flight's ""Snow Bird"", it's not. But I liked it anyway. It can be a little slow at first, but stay with it, it gets better. Good Bridget Fonda/ Hallmark movie."
2,a wee bit boring,"It's been months since I saw this so it's not that fresh, but I can say for sure that it's not a very memorable movie and pretty slow. I did make it to the end, unfortunately, and figured I pretty much just wasted time. Go get Arabian Nights."
3,History is important,"A good book for those who relish history. A bit dull at times, but all in all, a good read."
4,Pezcore 10th Anniversity Edition,"18 Track Pezcore album reissued. Accompanying live DVD filmed on February 10, 2007 in Ft Lauderdale recreating all 18 tracks in order from Pezcore."
2,Not the clamp in the picture,"The photo at the time of my purchase showed a nice O-Clamp design. I ordered 4 of these, and was upset to discover that they were actually C-Clamps with a screw in wing-nut which is likely to damage my aluminum truss. If you are looking for a C-Clamp style device to hang your lights, there is nothing wrong with this one, it just won't work for me.This is what I actually received: <...>Hopefully Amazon will match the product with the picture in the future."
3,Good movie - - - LOUSY copy,"I like this movie.. but the copy is horrible.It is truly like someone copied from an OLD VHS -- that was taken off of channel 5 and was eaten by their dog.....besides that it is fine :)I am not making fun, I doubt there is a master copy of this flick so this may be the only way to see it.. Believe it or not this is one of my fave movies so I have been searching for this.I am happy to see it on DVD and I DID like the movie itself, but lets say you have a version on VHS.. you will not get much of a better quality version here, except no commercials.I give it 4 * for the movie and 1* for the copy.Jim"
1,This is TERRIBLE,I am a Gordon Lui fan.I am a Kung Fu fan.Please avoid this movie.Not even the 18 Bronzemen could save it.For good Gordon Lui Kung Fu movies get:Shaolin Master KillerWuTang & ShaolinFist of the White Lotus
3,An open question...,"Why do the Relativity and Castle reissues of this album sound so muddy? With an album like ""Zeit"" it matters. I've got a single-disc version from Jive Electro (80s) that sounds cleaner than any R/C version I've found. This set sounds like it was mastered from second or third generation tapes.5 stars for the album, 1 star for this version = 3."
5,Tangerine Dream's Most Daring and Greatest Work,"Never before in the history of rock has an album achieved such a feeling of darkness and beautiful melancholy as this brilliant CD. ""Ziet"" is four 20 minute-long compositions of ethereal synthesizers, gritty and dissonant string quartets, and raw organs. It is a profoundly moody and dismal album, and helps you get in touch with that dark side of the human spirit that people these days don't often embrace. It is an absolute must for fans of ambient/electronic music, and demostrates how early tape loops and electronics can create sounds of unparelleled beauty and atmosphere. I simply can't reccommend this work enough for anyone who has an ear that is open to new experiences. It's a masterpiece."
2,Lost in Space,"I'll try to be brief. This album opens with a very promising string quartet (cellos I think), with intense dense harmony. Then the band switches on the organ and puts a few weights on the keys, and leaves the studio for almost an hour and a half. You sit there (or lie there) and listen, waiting for something to happen, but it never does...then you finally hear a little bit of a click or something, and think something's happening, but after 15 minutes of that you realize it was one of the old electric instruments making some sort of recurring buzzing noise. This album is so boring you won't even be able to fall asleep to it. The background hiss coming through from the original tapes is more interesting than the music. I love TD especially all the 70's stuff, but this was a bit disappointing. I guess they wanted to see how little sound they could put on album, but the experiment failed, in my opinion. For hardcore fans of their early period only."
3,Dull compared to most Tangerine Dream CD's,I was disappointed with this CD - found it dull and boring. Not up to the usual Tangerine Dream standards. A bit mechanical and repetitive. Skip this one and buy some of their other CD's.
1,Early weird phase,"This is from their early phase, not my cup of tea at all. Mostly electronic noise as far as I am concerned, not music. I love their later stuff starting with the period of Force Majeur, Rubycon etc."
2,No,"Not this one. If you are about to slit your wrists, then yes. Major downer. I saw TD live btw in Mpls in 86 or so, quite the scene, and I'm a huge fan in general. But this CD bites."
4,"Serious, hard-core introspection","This is the one TD Cd to get (if you can) when wordless and complex moods are what you seek. Beyond the space rock of Pink Floyd or 2001 Soundtrack enthusiasts, this is an aural soundscape of something so subjective that even writing this favorable review seems trite. I have read that many TD fans hate this era of their music and that this album is the equivalant of a gigantic comma...a pause of statement rather than a concrete creation. I disagree. This is my favorite. This is the recorded journey of TD. Only they could know what inspired and moved the sounds they chose. We as listeners can bring our own minds to their 50 yard-line and create a true interactive experience of our own. Just get it."
5,electronic book,"Some people can not read electronic books, I like them. This way you have a big library with you anyware"
4,bomr,"This was quite entertaining. I loved the language! Easy and silly, fun escape! How I chose this--just looking through the Kindle Store. It was my first selection to read from my new Kindle Touch. It worked just fine!!!"
3,Humorous?,"This was an OK book, not as funny as I had hoped, but it was readable in that it didn't get too boged down, the action moved along well enough."
4,Let it Snow,"I thought this was a formula movie that worked....I thought the characters were likable. I thought they were quirky,( but extremely likable. I though the characters had some great lines. This is a nice sweet movie to watch with your significant other on a Saturday night. The movie doesn't try to be anything other than entertainment."
4,Formula mistiming between potential mates,"Yep, this is a formula movie. So we will not compare it for originality of which it has none. The actors go through the motions and make faces that could work for silent movies. The title is unique. I guess as the only time they can get together is on a snow day. This makes for a frosty relationship at best.The story is about two people played by Kipp Marcus and Alice Dylan with different agendas and never seen to get together an opportune time. Never a happy moment movie."
3,"closing song title, please?","this movie was a pleasant surprise. i especially enjoyed the song in the end, the one with lines referring to romeo and juliet. can anyone tell me the title of the song, though?thanks:)"
4,very fun,movie was very good and also funny blind instructor was hillarous and bad guys alsofunnyi enjoyed it greatly very inventiveChinese Connectionbruce li very good
2,"Starts off slow, but it gets better","Bruce Li stars as a man who learns kung fu from 2 imcompetent teachers. They teach him a bunch of fake animal styles and he finally figures out that they are fakes. With goons taking over the town Li has to find a good teacher to learn kung fu quick. Enter Simon Yuen.The first hour has some decent comedy, but the action is not good at all. Bruce Tong has a nice cameo at the start, but then there are a bunch of weak fights. But then out of nowhere Bruce Li has an awesome fight with Kong Do and 2 other guys. Then Tiger Yang shows up. Yang's first fight is good, but the final fight is a disappointment.2/5"
5,Love it!,"Great coconut oil, I love this product a lot. It leaves my hair soft, moisturized and manageable. It's good for a pre-shampoo treatment. I highly recommend this product!"
3,Good Hair Oil,"Let me start by saying that the product and the service are very good. I liked the oil and the slightly exotic scent.My problem with this oil is that it solidifies (except during a summer heat wave) and in this state is extremely difficult to squeeze out of the tiny opening of the bottle, and often ends up making a mess, if it finally squirts out and lands on your shower curtain In a greasy blob! It should be packaged in a jar, and the it would be a 5 star product.Being environmentally conscious, I do not like that I need to run hot water over the bottle to get the product out..."
1,Not what I had expected,"I was really excited about trying out this product, but it was not what I had expected. The texture was rather surprising. Instead of a thick liquid, it was more solid and lumpy like grits. This made it difficult to get out of the bottle and apply evenly to the hair."
3,Very Oily,I bought this product to get healthier and longer hair. Honesty the smell was repulsive to the point that I almost couldn't use it. However I did use it for a couple of months and notice only a nominal amount of hair growth. For the most part it left my hair oily and stinky. Not worth it for the results.
5,Excellent,A month ago I did the bc to my hair and went natural no more relaxers! Well I was in search for products that would grow my hair fast and that would keep my hair healthy and strong!Several girls on Youtube recommended the product so I did order Dabur Vatika hair oil from Amazon.com! This is one of my favorite hair products!!!!!
3,Great Humectant.,"This is wonderful but for me, it's best used on occasion versus daily or weekly. Works great when deep conditioning, after hennaing to restore moisture, or as a humectant when blow drying."
3,great in the summer,"I usd this product on my hair all summer with good results... but when the temps got cooler (we live in Phoenix, AZ) the contents in the bottle got waxy and sluggish like ... so I tried warming it up with warm water... When it was warmed up, it was easier to apply to my hair, but still made my hair feel clumpy and sticky :( Not good.My experience is that this product is best used during the hot summer months."
5,Just what I needed,"Needed a DC plug for my laptop power supply. This piece arrived on time, and it works as advertised. Nice job."
4,29 minute workout video,I had this tape way back in the day and it was one of the only workout videos I could do the whole way thru. I loved that video and I lost mine. Thanks to Amazon I have found an oldie but a goodie.Thanks alot.
5,great workout for 30 minutes,"I have had this workout since it first came on the market. The 80's I think. I still do this today. It is a great workout every time. The clothes they are wearing are a little dated. I struggle every time to get through the arm workout, wow it kills me. My sister who is a tri-athelte loves the video. This is labeled for beginners and beginners can do most of it but it's good once you are advanced too."
2,Cheap plastic not worth the price,"Soft plastic/rubber keychain, adequate if you don't want to scratch the finish of your lawn mower, but not a high quality product."
4,as an argument of theory...,"this book is extremely condensed into a multitude of thumbnails or panoramas and text that never fails to reiterate its point. i mean, these two architects really understand the idea of symbols, suggestions, and sheds but after a dozen pages on one idea, you already get the point.the images are really helpful in exemplifying the amount of criticism for or against the city (""idea"") of las vegas."
3,Read this book to learn what you shouldn't do as an architec,"Read this book to learn what you shouldn't do as an architect!This book follows Venturi's ""Complexity and Contradiction"", where you can learn how cynically to use casement windows in housing for the elderly where the elderly will happily put their plastic flowers in the windows, but *you* secretly know these are not really hormal casement windows, since they are out of scale (like fascist architecture's lack of scale?).This book will tell you about ducks and decorated sheds, but it will tell you nothing about building spaces which nourish creative human community. Try Louis Kahn (e.g., John Lobell's lovely little book ""Between Silence and Light""). My postmodernist teachers at Harvard said Kahn's writings were incomprehensible, which says more about them than about him.Read Lobell's book and learn why, e.g., a city might deserve to exist. Remember: Only *you* can get beyond postmodernism!"
5,Excellent Law Dictionary,"This is a ""must have"" book for any law student or lawyer. The only suggestion for improvement would be to have tabs or some other means of easily turning to sections. Other dictionaries have had these aids for eons."
5,Great Reference,"I am a 1L in my second semester and bought this a week into my first semester. Sure you can see all the defintions online these days at Westlaw, but there is a reason that textbooks aren't digital. Sometimes you just have to read it for real to understand it. This book contains every term you could possibly ever need to know. It also has relevant hypotheticals to explain terms, more than likely in a relevant situation to what you are trying to learn. I know that I use it everyday, and more likely than not you will too.My only problem with the book is that it does not contain the ""tabs"" that a normal dictionary would, seperating each letter. I am sure that the editors assume that as law students we should be able to predict where each first letter will appear in realtion to the size of the text, but still, it would be much nicer than flipping through when the only thing you want to know is what ""parol"" means."
5,Black's Law Dictionary-8th Edition,"This edition has over 40T entries for legal research scholars.The volume is written in simple English. It is well organized.A number of fairly complex definitions are listed. Sample entries are:o obiter- by the wayo particularity- detailed statement of particularso manifestly against the weight of evidenceThe book is an excellent value for the price charged. It willassist lawyers, legal students, scholars and the judiciary."
5,black's Law Dictionary,This is the best book to use when you need to get an answer to a leal question? I use it as my bible for law.
2,Good effort,"I just finished reading ""Black's Law Dictionary,"" and I must say I disagree with many of the reviews on this board. I thought the story was fairly uninteresting and the characters one-dimensional. It started strong (the ""animus capiendi"" scene comes to mind) but it dragged in the middle and ended flat (too much time spent on the ""year-and-a-day rule""). I will admit I thoroughly enjoyed the list of British Regnal Years in Appendix G. Good effort by the author, the up-and-coming Black, but just two stars from this reviewer."
2,Dissapointed,"It's been a long while since I bought my last Blacks almost 30 yrs. ago. I wanted my daughter to have the primary tool every law student should have. When it arrived I was immediately struck by the deteriorated quality of the cover, followed by the deteriorated quality of the printing, paper and binding. For a research tool which will hopefully endure constant usage I don't believe it will survive the task."
4,A need for law students,"This is something the you will need if you are a law student. It is crucial to the sudying of law because there are many terms that are used in law that are not used anywhere else. If you do not understand a word or phrase and it has to do with law, chances are this dictionary will be able to tell you the meaning."
4,A truely great book,"This book is one of the best holocaust books I have read. It shows the powerful bonds between parent and child in times of crises. A wonderful first hand acount, but it is not for younger readers, because it is very grphic at times."
5,Couldn't put this down.,"I love, love loved this book! It's heartwarming and inspirational, which is new for a holocaust book. I was heartbroken over the story and the circumstances, but warmed by her mother's efforts."
1,Clash of Civilzations,"I was repulsed by the tone and demeanor of this author in this book.He travels through one of the historically most significant part of the World, where there is so much history and culture, so much that has been kept for millions of World travelers to see and enjoy but all he can focus on is the little people of a developing country. His disdain of the Third World and Turks and Muslims in general made this a very unpleasant read.He avoids contact with educated professionals and limits his interactions to the simple folk who make him feel so much more superior.True, the time of his travel was a politically and economically chaotic period of the country but he should have been able seperate this from the larger historical perspective this travel book supposedly aimed for."
3,What a let down. Nice to see Davy back again.,"Jumper was truly a gem. This follow up didn't have the knock out power I expected. With so much possibilities, author took a nother revenge route to this book. It was done with the Jumper. Why do it again?Author leaves lots of details and unfinished business(?) in this book that I can safely assume that a third book is on its way soon. As much as I like Steven Gould, he could have done better.Not worth hardback but paperback is worth the money."
1,Jumper 5 - Reflex 1,"Everything I liked about Jumper was missing here. The few things I disliked about Jumper were spotlighted here. The book may have been well-written but it was too painful to read. I felt myself cringe every time I picked it up. After 150 pages, I could no longer even pick it up. I am fan of Wildside, Helm and Blind Waves, so I haven't looked forward to a book this much in a while. I expected more of the discovery and amazement, but instead read something about torture and despair. I realize it probably got better as the hero overcame the odds, but I just couldn't get there."
3,Entertaining but Forgettable,"REFLEX, the sequel to JUMPER, is set over ten years after the first book and finds Davy the teleport married to Millie, the girlfriend from Oklahoma, and doing free-lance jobs for the NSA he used to hate. After Davy is kidnapped and held by super-bad guys, Millie discovers she can teleport, too. So, the rest of the book is jumping around all over the planet, too much like a video game for my taste. I feel as I did with JUMPER, that this book would have been a real gem if there had been more character development. As it was, the characters could all be summed up with one stereotypical sentence, such as ""Pretty psychologist"", ""Crazy black lady"", ""Kid from abused home"", etc."
1,Totally boring. Just get on with the action!!!!,"Way too slow!!! Nothing exciting here at all. It took forever to get going if it actually got going at all.If this was a movie, it would be over in 5 to 10 minutes. Rubbish story, rubbish writing and rubbish overall concept.Waste of time as this sequal goes nowhere.Very dissappointing."
5,An author showing 10 more years of experience,"Like many, I read the original Jumper because I felt the movie just couldn't be the whole story, and I was pleased when I found a very strong story without the mention of Paladins in the original book. The book felt like it was told through the eyes of a teenager, which felt good, worked well and lifted the first book up a bit out of a few errors here and there that slipped passed the editor and typesetter.This book feels like it was written by an adult, solid research, same character, but grown up, with strong and interesting problems. The authors polish shines through and his focus is on long term development.Simply excellent."
4,Great addition to a great series,"Jumper was a far better book then the film that was made from it, and here we finally have a follow up. Set 10 years after Jumper, Davy and Millie are an established couple and very much grown up. As payback for being left alone, Davy undertakes occasional Government missions using his teleporting skills but is captured by someone with an agenda to brainwash and use him and his skills. In the meantime Millie searches for him and makes an important discovery that may change everything.This is thoughtful well written stuff. Good plotting and characterisation with an intriguing premise. Very enjoyable and recommended."
5,Excellent sequel,"AWESOME thriller for a great master piece like Jumper.Keeps you to the edge of the chair wanting for more and more, you can't get yourself away from this book."
3,Response to your request for input on Reflex (Jumper),"It was an interesting story and an easy read. However, the author asks the reader to accept a great deal at face value. The ""jumps"" are never given any real sense of credibility, and when it was necessary, out of convenience, the so-called protagonist's wife, accidentally discovers she is capable of the same phenomenon. To me, her transition from a clinician to investigator to heroine were highly incompatible and inconsistent."
4,"Great Book, Real Page turner","I haven't read 'Jumper', so had no expectations for this one--and found it wonderful. Waiting for the next one and planning to go back and get 'Jumper'."
5,Excellent sequel to _Jumper_,"This is a great sequel to _Jumper_. It was a very fun read.Good action, interesting plot twists, bad guys more evil than the NSA, and many interesting new characters."
4,very good,"I saw the movie Jumper and while it was a good show for the special effects, reading the books and the sequel really brought it to life"
4,A good sequel for Jumper,"I didn't enjoy this quite as much as Jumper, but don't get me wrong - Gould has written a worthy sequel to that book. It builds off the first story well, explores the world the characters live in a bit more, etc. I was looking forward to the third one, until finding out that it is written to conform to the story as modified for the film adaptation. Do yourself a favor and skip Griffin's Story.I'm mentioning that now so hopefully you won't buy it after this one, expecting a third book that makes any sense."
2,A Slow-moving bore that had some terrible acting.,"There's some pretty pathetic acting going on in this movie. Cuba Gooding was ""under the radar"" (i.e. over-acting). I can't even start to tell you how bad this movie is. The ""Organization,"" ""Mafia"" actors or whatever you call to choose them, were stereotypical of lousy mob movies.Mathhew Modine wasn't very convincing, James Caan played his usual type character (i.e. nothing new) and Caan's daughter 'Clarissa' (Joey Lauren Adams) posessed this really squeaky-type annoying voice. Almost sounding like a parody of Lisa Simpson.The plot was far-fetched (A mob hitman suddenly trains overnight to become a stuntman. Yeah, right) and badly directed. I don't know what people see/saw in this movie as ""action"" - it wasn't. Good thing this movie wasn't widely released; it would have been mercilessly panned by the critics. All the actors must have been really ""off their game"" in this one."
2,"""Show me the money!""","Cuba Gooding Jr&James; Caan give the only good performances in this movie,though they look like they're in agony on account of the awful screenplay.Strangely,I've sat through this movie TWICE.It's so bad it's engrossing.Matthew Modine,who was once a rising star in the '90s,is now on this straight-to-video dud.He plays a hitman trying to reform his life--and it's as melodramatic&unconvincing; as church musicals about people giving their lives to God.The gangsters are campy enough to have John Waters as their padrone.The premise-a stuntman?-whose death must be avenged is ridiculous,as is the unconvincing romance between Modine&his; squeaky-voiced ladylove (she sounds like Disney's Snow White)The ending is ENDLESSLY drawn out,so like the hero you want to cry out,""Just shoot me!"""
2,"Great Start, disapointed with ending.","The whole movie up the end was great, but just when I think this hit man is finally gonna get his chance to a normal life style, he dies. His death was a big blow for me as I waited up late to watch it and then the ending was like a real bad disapointment for me. He fought so well and then went out like nothing. Bad ending, I was mad!"
2,All or None Spinning,"Purchased this Gyro towable new. Only has a 200 lb limit so fuller-sized people can't ride it without possible damage. We found it either an ""all or none"" spinner. It pulls straight without spinning. Around corners, it is hard to get it to start spinning, but once it does, it spins very fast and somewhat out of control. Scared my younger child (age 6) so she won't ride it anymore. Also around 4.5 foot long, so taller people like myself have difficult time staying inside tube."
5,Long lasting belts,"I am very satisfied with the Magnate 1 x 42 sanding belts. They last a long time, were priced right, and delivered on time. They load up when dry and used on soft metal, but work well when wet. This seller is a very good merchant, from whom I've purchased abrasives before. I order from Amazon stores when I can because of their security and I've never had a problem with an Amazon order."
5,marvelous,"unbelievable for the price. had occasion to call support for minor questions and got a quick and helpful response, unlike was happening with dell. blistering speeds. recommended without qualification."
2,Not happy with HP in general,"I purchased 2 a1630n desktops. The first one had to be sent back to HP after having it for 4 days. They had to put in a new power supply, after it just stopped turning on. Now the second one just started actingup. First the mouse stpooed working, then the keyboard and now it turns on, but it won't do anything."
4,Bug Bites...,"Dr. Cahill (Thomas Calabro) is a recovering alcoholic. After being unable to perform a surgery, he is told to take a ""vacation"" by his superior. This leads him to a small island, where he hopes to settle in and relax. Instead, the locals, led by two brothers (one played by John Savage), cause nothing but problems for Cahill. Meanwhile, a growing legion of biting, killer cockroaches have arrived on the island, ready to destroy all in their path! Dr. Cahill, with the help of the sheriff (Dean Stockwell!) and the gal from the general store (Kristen Dalton), must find out what's been killing the townsfolk before it's too late. CC is a solid little grabber w/ enough twists and jolts to keep things running on all six legs. There's even some gory goo that's surprising for a PG-13 movie! Loved it..."
4,creepy crawlers - very good movie,"think i saw this a year ago and remember how good of a movie it was. had to buy the DVD right away. definitely better than the movie THE NEST. highly entertaining movie with plenty of cochroaches for everyone. swarms of roaches try to take people out one at a time and take over the island. fairly suspenseful, definitely worth checking out!"
2,A paradise of clichés,"Although principally an exercise in wish-fulfilment for prurient and paradise-starved Europeans it is hard to deny the captivating beauty of Sylvain's photos. That said, colour is the essence of Tahiti and black and white studies do more for the drizzle-drenched backstreets of Leeds and Liverpool than for the lush forests and lagoons of the tropical South Pacific. A book that has prolonged the myths and contributed to the transformation of Tahiti into a tacky theme park."
5,A Must Read,"Dennis McCallum has done a great job explaining why nothing in our society seems to make sense any longer. The book is, mildly stated, a masterpiece, though it does demand a better than average I.Q. and an academic background. It is not for feather brains and airheads. The first few chapters are heavy slogging, but well worth the trouble. Near the end, McCallum fits the puzzle together, and the book makes a great deal of sense. I recommend this book not only to Christians, but especially to secular thinkers,who are now beginning to ask themselves what has gone wrong in our Western world view ."
3,Intelligent Perspective,"The Death of Truth gives a good overview on the dangers posed by postmodernism from the well-intended racism of multiculturalism to academia's pandemic rejection of the concept of absolute truth. Although some specifics are provided in every chapter, the book seems to occasionally become bogged down by abstract theories. I found other recent works like ""the Diversity Hoax"" and ""the Death of Common Sense"" to be better caveats of these same pernicious trends.One other complaint is the authors'repeated use of the term ""humankind;"" a book that rightly warns of the dangers of political correctness should not stoop to employing even such innocuous PC terms.It is definitely worth a read but should been sign more as the tip than the hidden ice burg."
3,good Supplemental Text for Nutrition,"This book is a compilation of current articles on nutrition topics. Each article is a few pages long, and written well for the lay person or non-major nutrition class. The topics covered are up to date with current nutrition issues in science and the community. Would give it a good rating as a supplemental text to a basic science/nutrition text to cover up to date issues."
5,Dartboard,"This was a gift for my grandson and he loves this dartboard. He researched and it's exactly what he wanted, especially the self-healing part. It seems to be top of the line."
3,it was nice,it was nice but it was a gift and the numbers that are wire that make up 1 to 20 i can't read what some of the numbers were like anything that has a 3 in it. But the board it self was very nice. thank you.
5,Good choice,I am no expert but this board is nicer than anything I've seen in a bar. I love the way it heals itself--I've had it a couple years and it still looks brand new.
5,Great,"Real high quality, I'm no pro but apparently this is a great one, and its definitely much nicer than any other ones I've seen or my friends have had. Would definitely buy again."
4,"Nice, no matter who sings it...","Love the songs of this musical! I have the 25th anniversary DVD, and really wanted it on CD since Alfie sings on it; but apparently it is not available. But, this is very nice. Because it is older, the acoustics are not quite up to par with current digital recordings, but it's not bad. I tend to forget all that when I get swept away in the music.As for which version is best, guess it depends on how you were introduced to Les Miserables. I was introduced during the 25th anniversary at the O2, so for me,no one can compare to Alfie Boe for the lead. Some of the other characters sing better on this 10th anniversary version. But they are all great talents, so It's all beautiful."
3,Not as good as the Original London Cast,"I debated which recording of Les Miserables to buy -- London, Broadway, or 10th Anniversary -- and from listening to samples on the internet and reading reviews, I settled on the Anniversay edition. However, I regret that decision. Having now listened to the CD, I find the sound ""flat."" I don't know if that's due to the musical arrangements or if it's the sound of the orchestra or the voices or if it's in the recording process. I just listened to a tape of the original London cast and like that one much, much better. It has a richness and a fullness to it that sounds a world apart from the 10th Anniversary CD recording. I would recommend the London cast to anyone."
5,BEST!,"I really adore Mr. Colm Wilkinson (I have his STAGE HEROES, he is spectacular), but the dream cast should have Mr. ROBERT MARIEN (The French Valjean in the end of the show, the second one to sing after Mr. Colm) as Jean Valjean (The latest Valjean on Broadway). At the end of the show all Valjeans of the world sing together, this is the spirit of the show. A very good recording. Judy Kuhn and Ruthie Henshall, no words..."
3,A Concert Recording,"The sound of this musical is like a live concert, which it was. So when listening to it at home, you can't help but hear the ""outdoor""/concert sound of the recording. I bought it coz it's an ALL-STAR cast. I'm just not very happy w/ the ""concert"" sound of it. I prefer the clearer sound of original London and Broadway recordings. But don't get me wrong. It's a good cd. An All-Star cast indeed :)"
5,Simply the best!,"For those who want every bit of the musical, get the Complete Sumphonic Recording. For those who want the most riveting performances, this is THE recording to get. It has the best actors (Colm Wilkinson, Michael Ball, the amazing Lea Salonga, and many more), the exciting atmosphere of a live concert, and the memorable, added musical number from the different Valjeans from productions from different countries. Worth every $!"
4,Superb but for Colm Wilkinson,"I came to see this show very late, having only recently witnessed its latest Broadway incarnation. I heard a lot about the legendary Colm Wilkinson performance and eagerly awaited it. Somewhat to my dismay, Wilkinson never even really sings. He just sort of acts like a cantor, blurting out a few notes between sort of spoken words. I could tell even from this disc how well his acting must have gone over. BUT the lack of singing was a great disappointment.On the other hand, it was relief to have the parts of Eponine and Fantine actually sung by actresses who could hit the high notes rather than just screech them, as with the current Broadway production.One thing that does not change: the moving, monumental score.I think this is the disc to have, esp since Colm is on the Broadway and London discs, too."
4,Excellent,"This is the best recording as it has the best people in it. I prefer Colm Wilkinson to Gary Morris as he seems more natural but he was not brilliant as Jean Valjean. Philip Quast was stunning as Javert and by far the best one in it. Ruthie Henshall was very good as Fantine, Judy Kuhn was okay but was not brilliant. I really like Michael Maguire and Michael Ball but Lea Salonga is not as good as she was in Miss Saigon. The Thenardier's are very good. This is the best recording of Les Miserables."
3,Good,"I rather watch the video. The recording is good, but gets rather tiresome upon repeat listenings. Colm Wilkinson isn't at his best, but still very good. Ruthie Henshall is excellent. So are Philip Quast, Michal Ball, and Judy Kuhn. Lea Salonga is also excellent, but he problem I have with her is that she concentrates too much on making her singing sound perfect rather than sinning her heart out. I have heard her sing ""On My Own"" better. Michael Maguire is pretty good., so is Allun Armstrong (though his Thénardier is somewhat annoying!). The only one who isn't too good is Jenny Galloway. Her Mme. Thénardier is ineffective, flat and a two-dimensional cartoon character. Overall good, but buy the video first!"
5,SIMPLY THE BEST RECORDING OF THE BEST MUSICAL!!!,"What else can one say about this MAGNIFICENT concert/recording? I loved every second of it. Every song is worth 5 stars itself. The performances are superb, of course. Well, what else could you expect when you have Colm Wilkinson (THE Valjean), Philip Quast and Lea Salonga? The only ""flaw"" was Judy Kuhn's performance, which I found dreadful. I espessially loved the end when International Valjeans sing ""Do You Hear The People Sing?"" The sounds the audience makes (applauding etc.) are not disturbing at all (except this point in ""Castle On A Cloud"" when a ballon pops. I swear, if I knew the kid who did this I would strangle it). Don't wait! GO BUY IT NOOOOOOW!!!!"
3,Les Mis is a good show when you watch it.,"Actually, it's a great show. It has a story with so many plot twists and complex characters to make your head spin. And the music, at first, is also amazing. But, after watching some more shows, the music can also get annoying. Not the really great songs, like ""On My Own"", ""Stars"" and ""Who am I"", but the endless droning of things like ""The Work Song"", ""A Heart Full of Love"" (the cheesiest song ever), ""Lovely Ladies"", and ""At the End of the Day"". Frankly, songs like these just turn me off (and the CD) completely. If you only see this show, however, you'll probably keep on liking it. It's just one of those shows."
5,LES MIS RULES!!!!!,"Les Miserables is a masterpiece and has to be one of the greatest, most epic musicals of all time. If you want to experience Broadway , people, this is definitely the CD to get!"
5,The Best Les Mis Recording ever!!!,"What a voices!!!A taylor-made roles for Michael Ball, Ruthie Henshall and Lea Salonga.Lea Salonga's ""On My Own"" is the most unforgettable version of all time. Francese Ruffelle and Kaho Shimada can't get close to her voice.Michael and Lea's version of ""A little fall of rain"" was breathtaking and very remarkable. There's just nobody in this generation can surpass such wonderful rendition.And, Ruthie Henshall's version of ""I dreamed a dream"" was fabulous. Her rendition is far more better than Patti Luppone. She sang it with vocal strength coupled with emotion.This album is simply awesome!!!! If you're looking for real singers get this CD and video too."
5,Powerful,"This CD was my introduction to Les Mis. PBS showed this performance in 95 I believe, and I at 16 and my sister at 14, were entranced. Have been ever since. The particular concert is powerful and emotional... brings me to tears at times. I don't know alot of the history of the singers that participated, but I do know that this is my favorite recording to date and Wilkinson and Salonga are completely bewitching. I've shared this CD with many others and although they lack the knowledge of the storyline they are pulled in by the music.Can't recommend this highly enough. Just wonderful all around."
5,You MUST buy this CD!,"This CD is by far the best of all the Les Mis recordings. The cast is wonderful, Ruthie Henshall, Philip Quast, and Lea Salonga especially, though all of them have gorgeous voices. While a CD that was recorded in a studio may have better sound quality, it is missing the emotion and excitement. The TAC has practically no faults. There is only one small flub during Castle on a cloud. While Hannah Chick is singing the word 'allowed', a balloon pops in the backround. But this CD is so wonderful, you'll hardly notice it."
5,Fantastic music,"I bought this after seeing the new movie and learning the music from it was not the full score..SO, if you want the most popular song....the one with do you hear the people sing on it..BUY THIS ONE!!!!!!!"
5,Les Mis,"Of all the performances of this great work, this one is my favorite musically. The recent movie version contains the best acting, but this recording is the BEST musically."
4,Les Mis does not disappoint,"I followed the recommendation of other reviewers, and was not disappointed...this is a very satisfying C/D of the musical....after repeated playing, it still thrills."
1,Ugh!,"This is the worst redording of Les Miserable I (and my friends) have ever heard. Lea Salonga performance of Eponine is horrible. It's as though she didn't really understand Eponine or feel her. Her songs doesn't have the emotion of Frances Ruffelle. Eponine is supposed to sound like Ruffelle, even Victor Hugo himself described her as having that kind of a voice (I can't remember the exact words). I was also digusted with Gavroche. He is an adorable little street urchin (that means he is skinny as well)not the fat, tall kid who sounds horrid, they have portraying him in this cd. Well, those are my only problems. They may not seem like much, but Eponine and Gavroche are my favorite characters and I hate to see them ruined. *Don't get angry Lea Salonga fans, but you must not identify with Eponine that much either. I wouldn't talk, but I go through the same things Eponine does. Forgive me..."
5,"The perfect version, the perfect performers","I love it. Had to replace my old one and wanted exactly the same CD. As much as I loved the movie, I wanted the performers on this version, especially the strength of Javert plus Colm."
5,Best of the best!,"It's the finest group of Les Mis actors playing the roles in this once-in-a-lifetime event (special mention goes to Ms. Lea Salonga, the perfect Eponine). If your money allows you to buy only one Les Mis recording, get this one. This is the best!"
5,Outstanding!,The cast doesn't get any better than this. Cameron should have asked this whole cast to close the show on Broadway. The Eponine there (a Diana-something with a very squeaky voice) was just horrible!
5,Brilliant Cast,"Amazing cast. I much prefer this to the more recent anniversary edition. There are far more brilliant vocal moments here! You can't be sorry purchasing this. After seeing the Broadway production live several times, I still never tire of listening to this over and over again on my long drives. Dream cast for sure!"
5,Great!,"I got this for my wife for Christmas! She loved it! I even like it, and I'm not the biggest fan of musicals."
5,THE EVEREST OF MUSICALS,"I think that I am really the no 1 Les Mis fan in the world after all I have seen it 7 times including 3 times starring Philip Quast (awsome).This recording is live,it's there,it's real and tactile and envelops you and makes you soar to the highest peak...the Everest of musicals!!"
3,Suspicious.....pirate copy??,Not sure if this is the original CD the cover looks suspicious. I bought it for a gift so did not open it.
3,If this is a gift you might want to check if it's complete,"To be fair, I didn't make this purchase from Amazon or I probably would have gotten it taken care of by now. I bought a new set because I was under the impression the old set was damaged. Since finding out it wasn't I had hung on to it to give as a gift at some point. I decided that since I now have a car with a cd player I would use it in the car, opened the case and found I only have disc one, the other side is empty. I doubt this is something that happens often, but apparently it isn't completely out of the question. To make matters worse, I bought it from Borders so getting this taken care of might be a challenge ):"
3,Pretty good,"I like the orchestral work behind this recording. As a violist and composer, im particularly attentive to background accompaniments to these kinds of things. But honestly, Marious is absolutely hideous. Every time Marious sings, it sounds like he's sitting in a vibrating massage chair. His vibrato is so wide and fast the entire time you cant focus on what you're hearing, all you know is you're getting motion sickness. Its completely distasteful. I can understand that in certian places, you might intend to sound nervous or upset, but I mean this guy has no control over his voice at all. feel free to email me if you want a sample MP3 of what im talking about."
3,Lea Solonga Is the weakest Link,"Suprisingly, Lea Solonga is the weakest link of this recording. I do not like her interpretation of Eponine at all, which was very surprising to me because I love her in Miss Saigon.Colm Wilkinson is the most over-rated singer/actor in theater. He was terrilbe as Jekyll/Hyde and even worse as the Phantom. His Valjean is okay, but Gary Morris is much much better.This is a great recording to have...the Thenadiers are great. Michael Ball is WONDERFUL, as usual.I guess I'd prefer the CSR to this, definitely."
5,this was a great concert and the CD brings me back to it. BRAVO,this was a good buy. now I have the concert all to myself. this was a concert everyone who loves breadway should see!
5,Great recording,A passionate and lively performance. Best of all that recordings of Les Mis that I could find. Would highly recommend this.
5,Love this album,"I have been a fan of Les Miserables since watching a clip of it on YouTube. After completely watching the show (a local theatre group was doing it here). I feel in love with Les Mis. The cast is wonderful. Philip Quast, Michael Ball, and Colm Wilkinson are by far my fav. Broadway stars, ever. Philip's voice is just perfect for Javert and honestly I prefer him over the original Javert. I have always been a Michael Ball fan and so he was the reason for originally listening to this. So that was a plus and even while watching this I had couldn't help but fall in love with Michael Maguire's voice as well. And you may not realize it but Judy Kuhn (Cosette) is also the singing voice in Disney's Pocahontas and Lea Salonga (Eponine) is the singing voice in Disney's Mulan and also of Jasmine in Aladdin. So that's also a plus. All in all a great cd and one of my favorite Broadway soundtracks ever."
3,Openings are NOT 4-inch by 6-inch,"I was excited to find a frame to display 5 4x6"" pictures horizontally, as most of the other frames I found display the pictures vertically. However, when I received the product I was very disappointed to find that the mat openings only measure 3.5 x 5.5 inches. Very misleading! Also, the frame does not seem to be worth the cost. I initially thought it was plastic! Okay product, but now I'll need to figure out what to do about the smaller openings."
1,Editor went boom!,"Much has already been said about the poor editing in this novel. Regardless of the possibility that there was a screw up at the printers, there is no excuse for the poor quality of the manuscript. This book is not even ready to turn over to an editor, there are so many errors. There may be a good story under there with a few rewrites, but the typographical errors and inconsistencies in the writing keep jarring my attention from the story. Overall, this is a train wreck and the author deserved better from Palladium."
3,Sonic Boom almost a Sonic Puff,Only my love for Kevin Siembieda's Rifts saved this novel. Yes as you've seen in other revies the editing is truly awful but doesn't entirely detract from the book. The first book of a serious of three strikes as more of a hack and slash adventure idea put together by a basement game master but descripitions of equipment and settings is well done for reference purposes.
4,Excellent Seat With One Safety Flaw,"We bought this seat after weeks of comparison shopping and have used it for our son for 8 months; he is now in the Britax Boulevard. The base attached VERY securely in the car thanks to the rebound bar ... this was the decision maker for us ... this seat wasn't wiggling anywhere! The seat truly is perfection except the chest clip. The chest clip does not snap together like most others. This clip has a shoulder strap that is permanently in place and the other shoulder strap slides into the other side of the clip. At 6 months my son was able to pull on the clip and the shoulder strap would slip right out. Just recently he was able to pull the shoulder strap loose and wiggle his shoulder out from under the strap! And no, the shoulder straps were not lose ... he was snug in his seat. The only reason we moved him into the Boulevard at 8 months was because of this ... otherwise he still fit nicely in this seat still. Otherwise ... this seat would be perfect!"
5,Safety First,"I am grateful to say I don't know how it would hold up in a car cash. Our son is 4 months old and loves this car seat, seems very comfortable. It is ok to pack around, probably no different then any other one, maybe a little heavier, but thats what makes it so safe. We bought 2 bases so we would have one in each vehichle, works well. I want to know my son is in one of the best made car seats. I like the color black also."
1,Thought I was buying the safest seat for my little one - I was disappointed,I thought I was buying the safest car seat for my family but I was disappointed. I was disappointed the minute I took the car seat out of the box. I knew I wanted a seat with a chest clip NOT a sliding clip. I had studied the picture and description on the website and that is what I thought I was getting. Our little one is now able to slip the strap off even if I have the straps tight. It is time for her to move to another seat but we were hoping to use this seat again if we have another little one. I will need to contact the company to receive a replacement part. Not what I expected from a company with such a good reputation. We went with a Safety First seat convertible seat for our daughter's next car seat.
3,"Safety first, but the little things are annoying.","I like knowing that my baby is safer in this car seat, and I really appreciate the head pillow that it comes with, because all three of my children have been born under 6 pounds. However, I find myself frustrated in the day-to-day use by the difficulties I have getting it out of its base and by how hard it is to engage the buttons simultaneously to move the handle. The handle thing is the most annoying. If you're not positioned straight on, trying to engage the buttons for moving the handle, it's nearly impossible. Because of this, I hardly ever move it, which makes it less safe than it would otherwise be. I would probably tell a friend to look for another car seat with the same safety ratings."
4,highest safety rating! loved this seat!,"there may be easier seats to use, but i wouldn't know any better. we used this one for both our babies. but i wanted to point out, unlike the pictures added in, you CANNOT REMOVE THE PADDING AROUND THE HEAD! that is a serious safety hazard, the baby is left with nothing to prevent extreme movement in the event of an accident. i called britax about that when our baby's big head outgrew it and that was there response. they are right, just look at how many inches are between the little guy's head and the side of the car seat! anyway, we love this car seat and how much they test their seats. it had the highest safety rating when we bought ours. however, the strollers from britax leave much to be desired."
4,High quality car seat,"Robust and well constructed, this carseat is top quality. We did have an issue with the head support during the first few weeks of use. It proved to be quite big for my son when he was a newborn. We had to pad the sides so that his head won't tilt sideways. This didn't last too long though since my boy grew big quickly and the head support now fits snugly.We got the onyx color which on hindsight was probably not a great idea for our baby who gets hot easily. There are many times when we'd pull him out after a car ride sweaty at the back and behind his head. If you have a hot baby, we suggest getting a lighter color.Other than these 2 issues, we have been VERY happy with this product."
1,"Too big, too heavy, too hot. Do not buy this seat!","I have hated this seat since day one. First, it is heavier than most seats. So, once your baby really starts growing (which happens quickly) it is just too darn heavy to carry. Second, the black is just way too hot, it's like putting your baby in a cooker (at least in the south) Third, the seat with base takes up waaaayyyy too much room in the back of the car (and I have a mid size suv) Forth, the cords are constantly getting tangled and it does not snap easily. Fifth, mine is very touchy to get in and out of the base and stroller--sometimes gets stuck. Add all this up with a baby who hates being in his car seat and it is not fun whatsoever.On a positive note, one thing that is great about it is the canopy. Definitely get a car seat with a canopy- this has been invaluable to have.I wish I had shopped around. But, being a first time Mom it's really hard to know what you'll need in a car seat. I would definitely NOT recommend this seat."
2,Too Big for most cars,This car seat has a bounce rod on the back which makes it too big to fit in most of the cars. I was advised by the Plano Police Car Seat Inspections to return it
4,Works great. Can't collapse though.,"This works exactly as advertised. One note, however: it ships in two pieces to save space (I assume) and the first step is to insert the handle/back part into the base. Once you insert it, it's there forever (at least in our case.) We were bringing this to the airport and tried to break it down to save space, but the thing wouldn't budge. Not a huge deal, just though I'd mention it."
4,Convenient system,"The latches were stiff until they broke in a bit, but overall a very safe and reliable system."
2,Instrument has flaws,"I found that the head joint has some damage in that the metal is chipped where the head joint and body connect. Also I find it extremely difficult if not impossible to hit notes in the lower register that I had no problem hitting on my previous flute. I do not know if this is due to the damage at the head joint, my embrasure, the different make of the flute or a combination of these things. However, since I am only a casual player I can make the best of it, but it was dissapointing to find it damaged on my first time using it."
3,Bolo before Bolo,"I grew up watching Asian movies and this is oneI actually remember seeing on the big screen.'Big screen' would've been a good idea for theDVD, as the full screen cropping here rendersmuch of the already incomprehensible action inthis film even more so. It's a kind of a shamereally, as this is one of the few benchmarks inthe early Hong Kong career of martial arts starBolo Yeung, who started out as Yang Sze for theShaw Bros. and who here makes what I believe ishis only venture behind the camera as co-author,producer, fight choreographer, and director - aswell as playing one of the two leads. The plot isakin to a western, as two shiftless no-accountsare taken out of jail and forced to become the'law and order' of a small corrupt town, withcomic results - and some decent fight scenes.Yang Sze adopted the 'Bolo' name after his mostfamous character, the back-breaking bodyguard heplayed in Bruce Lee's 'Enter the Dragon'."
1,Forget it,"Sorry, but I only like Bruce Lee and Jackie Chen. Who is gonna even try to look for some third actor movies? Jet Li is the third star, but Bruce is the best, he is my brother and all..."
2,"No classico Ruben, y en mala forma.","Si eres un fanatico de las liricas fuertes y ritmos poderosos que hicieron famoso a Ruben Blades, te advierto que probablemente no te va a gustar. Si quieres comprar salsa que sale fuera del area geografica normal compra ""Salsa Around the World"" o ""Mandali"" del grupo Africando.Lo que tenemos aqui es un animal completamente differente. Suena como algo sacado para peliculas de Disney World. Mi punto es que el cambio de instrumentos y estilos toman el mando poniendo a las raices de la salsa en una posicion de menor importancia. Es musica de verla tocada en una universidad en vez de las discos salseras de Miami.Obviamente le gusto a mucha gente, pero no creo que casi ningunos sean aficionados salseros."
5,Superb,"Ruben Blades hit one out of the ballpark whit this new cd, the mixture of the music is superb and oustanding one of his best work yet, I rank it up there whit Buscando America one of my personal favorites, born and rise in Panama my self,I love the cut ""Como Nosotros"" It brings back some old good memories from back home. It is amazing how Ruben Blades can compose and sing songs whit other musicians from around the world, and that is the reason I recomend this cd, if you love music, then you will love this superb cd. Asi se lo recomiendo a todos, no se arepentiran."
2,Nothing special,"Tight, but boring. Could be better with a different singer. Overall they're not bad but after a couple songs I got bored. Even after hearing the whole CD, I didn't find one track that [I really liked} ."
2,Bad mic,"The headphones seem to be OK, but the mic creates nasty echo. When I talk to one person, it's bearable. When I am on a conference call, I have to mute myself or no one can hear anyone. Maybe it's a feature :)"
2,"Fine for music, TERRIBLE for calls","I ordered three of these from SF Planet for my Blackberry 8700, knowing from previous experience with Blackberry headsets that they tend to break down after a few months (i.e. one side stops working, starts to echo, etc.)Well I've tested them and ALL THREE produce an unmistakable echo. While this headset is in use, the person you are talking to will hear an echo of their own voice on their end, and when it is unplugged, the echo goes away. I have tried this with a number of different people and none of them can talk to me while I use the headset because of the annoying echo.Sound quality for listening to music was fine, with no echo, but since this is a headset with a mic, being able to talk with it is pretty important.I don't know if everyone will have this same experience, or if any of the stereo headset alternatives are any better, but this one definitely did not work for me when it came to making calls."
2,Wrong Title,"This is nowhere near as robust as the title would lead one to believe. It implies that the contents of this book would be more detailed regarding the risque lives of Elizabethan times. I have read many historical novels over the years which were much more enlightening regarding what went on behind closed doors. In short, this is a disappointment, being quite dry in long descriptions of court life, who pulled which strings to promote their own agenda, etc. Any author worth their salt who writes historical novels includes such details."
4,Women's Friendship,"A good read..... Woman are so resilient..and especially those out west. For any woman who's been alone, new to a community especially out west...pick it up...very, very encouraging."
4,A scathing deconstruction of Western society,"In ""The Place of Dead Roads,"" the second volume of the ""Cities of the Red Night"" trilogy, Burroughs continues his scathing deconstruction of Western society, making a murderously funny mockery of hypocrisy and hum-drum normality. Written with a practiced mix of anger and nostalgia, ""The Place of Dead Roads"" is like a prison confession written in some other dimension, a rollicking synthesis of Burroughs tropes old and new. Join Kim Carsons on his nightmare quest to rid the planet of its addictions: it's a surreal and haunting literary journey, the last 100 pages of which witness Burroughs at his visionary best."
2,Heads up...this version is not the complete story,"Just to let folks know--this version has passages that have been altered, shortened, or entirely removed from the original, and the ending is considerably changed. If you want Crane's work as it was originally published--and the ending that is both heartbreakingly bleak and visually evocative of her descent into the depths, definately buy another version. I recommend the Penguin Classics edition."
2,Iam curious yellow/blue,"watching these 2 movies is like throwing away 4 hours of your life. Very tedious to watch, jumps all over the place, this girl gets naked at the drop of a hat, its a hodgepodge of nothing. The only good thing is seeing the late 60's isms and the interviews with Dr.M.L.King."
2,Disappointing? Enlightening?,"Like other posters here, I'd heard of this movie for decades, so I finally decided to watch it so that I could have an opinion of it. It achieves the appearance of a documentary within a documentary, and I could see clearly thatg it was as much for the politics as the sexthat it was banned; yet what I was left with was a sadness from realizing that the USA has made patherically little progress socially, politically, sexually."
1,buny-in-the-headlights,"couldn't possibly recommend this movie to anyone. it is a self-indulgent exercise at very best from a man who wants to advertise to the world that he is having an affair with a young girl, and is ""modern"" enough to share her with others while filming her in the process --- absolute rubbish!"
2,I've wanted to see this movie forever...,"I've wanted to see I Am Curious - Yellow for what, 35 years now? It made headlines back in the 1960's when it was banned for having too much sex. Now I wonder what all the fuss was about. There was a little bit of sex, a little bit of nudity - but only slightly more than Janet Jackson at the Super Bowl. Only the government could get worked up over this movie.The other 98% of the movie had to do with commentary on excessive militarism (this movie was made during the Vietnam era - the 1960's version of Iraq), Western support for Spanish dictator Franco, and social justice in Sweden. It might have been relevant at the time - and a small portion of it still is - but many of the ideas shown then seem quaint today.The movie (as well as the Blue version) might be good for historical purposes, but it just doesn't seem entertaining these days. I would have enjoyed it more in 1968."
2,"Another one of those ""60's movies"" that doesn't pass the test of time","I remember hearing people talking about this movie and I could only imagine what kind of lurid and terrible acts were shown in the movie. I was surprised by what a boring story it turned out to be. There really is no point in watching this beyond a time capsule of the 60's sociopolitical scene. The first hour is a rather dry docudrama in a faux-cinema verite style about the class system that exist(ed) in Sweden. The second half is mostly about Women's Rights and the point of controversy sex scenes are there to show case the gender based power struggles in society rather than as porn. Overall a rather silly and rambling movie, the Pacifist Army Training bit is pure Monty Python - I kept expecting to see John Cleese pop up with his ""and now for something completely different"" line."
5,Great fun to read,"I read this book outloud to my 9 1/2 year old daughter who hung on every word. It was an unusual plot, and of course, it was fun to see that the kids can outsmart the adults at almost every turn. All of the characters were interesting and quirky but believable also. This is a really good book to read together but kids would enjoy it on their own too."
5,Best book ever,"This is the best book Ive ever read! If you r 9-12 read it! youre smaller? get your parents to read it, both of u will injoy it!!! You will soon be transported on a fabulous boat full of nannies towards a billion adventures."
2,Ultimate ripoff,"Don't be fooled by the title, or the fact that this is a two-disk set; anyone who just wants to watch Pamela Anderson do what she does best will be sorely disappointed.The first disk consists of nothing more than interviews with various people, such as Mr. Hefner, talking about Pam's career. I had to ask myself whether they really think anybody cares about any of this. My conclusion, of course, is that they don't; Playboy merely padded this to two disks with a load of tripe.Even worse, the second disk is only a compilation of previously released material, most of it shortened considerably (many are shorter than a minute!) from its original length.I would strongly advise fans of Pamela Anderson to look elsewhere to get their fill of gazing longingly at her beauty."
3,Desultory - 'Into Eternity' (Metal Blade),"'Into Eternity' was the Swedish black metal band's first album,out of the three total they've released.Even though this CD doesn't sound much different than countless other death,black or thrash metal discs out there,the playing is okay.Just nothing special.However,I also noticed one can actually make out most of the band's lyrics here.Sort of a rarity in the black/death metal field.As for the tunes,I thought ""The Chill Within"",the title cut ""Into Eternity"",""Tears"" and ""Passed Away"" were decent.Might appeal to those who support and follow Enthroned,Carcass and Suffocation."
3,Sherry Vinegar Bust,I love sherry vinegar but this product was very harsh and rough tasting. Not at all what I want in a sherry vinegar.
4,feels like hexen,"A top scroll shooter that wants to set your max colors to 256 each time it plays. It takes time to get used to the controls. I was able to play on my xp machine fine though, with it crashing only near the end (I just simply restarted, and it only crashed in that last location 50% of the time). I only had to use cheat codes while defeating the spider boss, and the last boss.I guess if you took hexen, dumbed it down a little, and made it a top scroll shooter, you'd get this. Other than being dated, nothing else wrong with this game, as I found it to be fun."
1,This is NOT the original Australian cast,"This recording is labeled as the original Australian cast recording which has been out of print since the 70's. This recording is the 90's revival version NOT the original starring Jon English and Trevor White. The 90's revival was very good, I just object to this being promoted as something it is not."
5,THE BEST JC EVER!!,"Do yourself a favor and order this CD!! I did and will probably order more for friends. John Fornham's Jesus is incredible! This man belts these tunes with ease,and as if the parts weren't written high enough he jumps to a belting soprano range and leaves you speechless and then has you reaching for the rewind button! The updated music is rocking and the supporting cast is dynamic!"
4,"Linguini Incident, quirky and weird.","It's quite a bizarre caper, and you have to wonder who came up with the idea of this movie. . . I saw it during a ""quirky"" film marathon with a bunch of friends, and I laughed so hard watching it. It's true, that the people who have seen it have mixed feelings about the film. You definitely have to be in the mood to enjoy its unusual sense of humor. One thing to keep in mind, don't take it seriously. . . I know that film critics have, and that is why they can't understand how good this film can be."
1,Crap movie,"This movie is not good. I bought it because my ex raved about it. It is bad, I want the time I wasted watching this movie back, but it is gone forever. Dont make the same mistake I did."
1,I was confused...,"I thought I would use this as a part of a course - buy it used only if you absolutely must. I bought this as a 'requirement' for attending a school for a Masters program, didn't even crack the cover until class work was finished. Did not have time - I don't cheat, so this was a waste of money. If you do not know if you are being appropriately original, check this book out. If you are confident in you work, don't waste your money."
3,IT LEAKS. NOT MUCH THOUGH,"At first there was no problem. After about 1000 miles a red drop appeared at the end of the drain plug. I wiped it off and did'nt drive it and checked again the next day, The red drop was back. No spot on the driveway though. There was ATF around the hex head of the drain, so it's not the plug that screws into it. I'll try a sealant next time I change the ATF."
3,"Make sure to use RTV, cheaper at Advance too.","When I tightened the nut the plastic washer just warped outward. I instead used high temperature oil resistant RTV to seal the bolts from leaking.After I purchased this my brother wanted one too and we actually found it at Advance Auto Parts for $2.99 made by Dorman. Just search on their site for ""65241"" it will bring up ""Dorman - Autograde Engine Oil Drain Plug"". Wish i would have seen that first. I like the Dorman one better too since it has rubber O ring for the drain bolt too.Either way it's installed and I'm happy with it. With the RTV applied it hasn't shown any signs of leaking so I guess that's good."
1,Disappointing,"I read this because the author was highly regarded by one of my favorite writers, Joseph Chilton Pearce. It was a huge disappointment. Layer upon layer of metaphor, classical references, even references to contemporary hipster artists. Needless layers of fluff obscuring what may be a powerful message."
1,A Misleading Listing of Content.,"Amazon listed this title as a 2011 release and did not say anything about the content titles.The content is ""100 Years of Strauss"" -- 2003, ""The Flying Dutchman"" - 2005, and ""In Wonderland"" -- 2008.Amazon needs to describe the content better. I have all three which I have played several times and have enjoyed them each time. I would like to return ""An Unforgettable Evening"" and exchange it for a couple of newer Andre Rieu titles."
5,I love it,I like the music that he played all the time it was real great and nobody can do something like him he is the best Villon Player
3,Andre Rieu,"The music, envrionment and presetation is excellent. Thr video is not so great. We see faces of people and their emotions. This distract us from enjoying music."
4,Brutal. Intense. Amazing. (INSERT WORD HERE________________),"Now the tendancy in the death metal genre is to have an album that never takes a break. An album that is just constant noise with no thought or subtlety put into it. Along with the first two Entombed albums (which are just as good, in fact Clandestine by Entombed is even better) this album doesn't constantly sing about devil worship, murders, rape and necrophilia. There are a few exceptions (hey, its death metal, like it or loathe it). Also, there are short little piano and acoustic pieces (yeah, you did read that right!) that show that this band aren't just kids making noise.Many death metal albums are unintentional examples of why thrash metal, melodic death, power metal and 90s metal tower above death metal as genres. Because they're more thought out and take more talent. However, this album is an exception to that rule. Seriously cool and highly recommended."
5,One of the best,"Morbid Angel are truly a band worthy of praise. They deseve to be commended for bringing a high degree of technicality to death metal. True, they aren't as brutal as Deeds of Flesh, nor are they as melodic as Arch Enemy, or as avant garde as (newer) Gorguts, but they are ten times as influential. This album is one of their best, with a variety of tempos to keep the whole affair from stagnating. Trey lays down some of his best solos, very atonal and Slayer-esque. Pete Sandoval provides some of the best double bass I have ever heard. David's vocals have a surprising amount of variety and suit the music very well. My personal favorite songs would be ""Abominations,"" ""Brainstorm,"" and ""Thy Kingdom Come."" Overall, fans of solid, well-executed death metal will be very pleased with this release."
1,Sorry to Burst your bubble...,"...but this album aint all that. its the production that killz it. the drums sound phony and terrible. clicky bass drum and the fills sound fake. the vokillz are way too high. look im a metal fan, but this type of production is the epitome of what metal shouldn't be. metals meant to be ugly, raw and nasty. this stuff is too clean. in all honesty if this record was produced to sound like altars of madness, i'd have given 4 stars. too flat, too fake. in my opinion this was morbid angels downfall. always this fake sounding production."
4,BEST OF MORBID ANGEL,"THIS ALBUM IS THE PEAK OF WHAT MORBID ANGEL CAN DO. IT IS SO MUCH MORE THAN YOUR STEREOTYPICAL DEATH METAL ALBUM. THIS RECORD HAS DEPTH AND ORIGNIALTY AND TREY. ONE OF THE TOP TEN DEATH METAL ALBUMS - DEFINITELY. THE SONGS AND RIFFS ON THIS ALBUM ARE GREAT, THE SINGING IS BEARABLE, AND THE SOLOS ARE SUPERB. ONCE YOU FEEL LIKE IT IS OUT OF CONTROL, THEY SLOW IT DOWN INTO GREAT ACCOUSTICALS. DEFINITELY A KEEPER."
2,try before you buy,"Is this ""special edition"" the one where they actually add GOOD SONGS? Sadly no. While some people find Morbid Angel intriguing, I find them boring. They are fast, yes, they are techinical, yes, but their songs just aren't that compelling.Bottomline - If Death's ""Leprosy"" is a 5 star death metal record then this is nowhere close. To avoid disappointment I would seriously consider listening to this record somehow before you buy."
5,Hell yes \m/,Amazing metal relesese from the death metal masters. I wore this cd out and had to buy it again \m/
1,Not the best book on the subject perhaps.,"I'm seeing a teacher of Alexander Technique, who recommended a few books, including this one. I'm now reading one of the other books. I gave up on this one after 76 pages. I think it's badly written - if a good book conveys information clearly, this one isn't it, I'd say. Judge for yourself by borrowing it from a library, as I did."
3,average,The book is pretty average. Not anything to write home about and difficult to know if you're doing the positions correctly. It would probably be better to a) find a personal teacher or b) take a class in the technique.
1,Terrible,"The idea is not a bad one: a New Jersey boy decides not to go to law school after college and instead heads to New York to fulfill his dream of being an actor. In the process, he disappoints his working-class father, loses his beloved girlfriend, and meets humiliation and failure.The execution, unfortunately, is awful. Except for a very young Kelly Ripa, who plays the role of the girlfriend quite charmingly, the actors are just awful. You'd think Robbie Bryan would be believable in the part of the struggling actor, since he wrote the movie, which is based on his own life story, but I'm afraid Mr. Bryan has absolutely no talent whatsoever. The rest of the cast is not much better and the directing manages to be clichéd and slightly ridiculous.Unless you want to be an actor, and need to be reminded that the path is hard and the odds of success are minimal, there's no reason to see this movie."
2,Check it out from the library,"This is the story of a young man who heads to New York to follow his dream of being an actor. It shows how hard it truly is to break into the business, even if a star recommends you for a job.If you are getting this because you are a Kelly Ripa fan, she does play her part well. But she is not a main character in the movie. I would have rated this movie only one star, but as others have said, the sub-plot with Lou Myers. He plays a former Negro League baseball player who is bitter and becomes friends with the main character played by Robbie Bryan. And the fact this independent film actually placed their parents home on the line to get it made. I would watch it to follow the sub-plot with Lou Myers."
1,THAT'S ALL HE WILL EVER BE!!,"Actually, I give this HOME MOVIE at big fat ZERO! I bought it at a dollar store for 5 bucks. Not worth it! It's just one of those cheapy jobs. The girl only shows up a few times, which is good since this Robbie guy looks like Jerry Lewis. He wrote the script: just as bad as his acting! I think the director won an award. I hate to see the films that lost. In one scene, the camera is behind the open door, and we don't see the girl until she enters the room. Any scenes that may be a little interesting were not filmed because of cost, like at the baseball game. Some of these films are ok, but not many."
4,"Finally, a good practical primer on how to prepare for possibilities of a new age.",Concise and easy to read information about Native American prophesies of soon to come changes to the earth and a practical guide on how to prepare for these changes.
1,Profiteering from Prophesy...,"If you are looking for a real discussion about these important prophesies...one with a researched and clear understanding of the prophesies and their *traditional* meanings, then you should avoid this book. If you want to read an uninformed stream of consciousness that is a cross between babble and rant with a lot of airy opinions and unsubstantiated woo-woo thrown in, then this is your book. These two ""writers"" are profiteering off of sacred teachings and people's fears. They come across as underqualified and overly self-impressed. They should be embarrassed..."
3,Not as easy as it looks!,"Great shoe, a little hard to handle though. Practise makes perfect they say, so will keep trying! Excellent value! Lovely style."
4,x-mas box,"The DVD arrived in perfect condition. What I have experienced is that there is a descrepency between when Amazon.com says an item has been shipped and the actual day the seller ships the item. Also, even though an item may have been sent Priority mail, independant contractors do the delivering. When I traced my item it said the DVD was at the Post Office, calling the Post Office, I was told after checking their electronic data, that there was no record of the item ever being shipped or received. We received the item the next day. The item was received within the expected timeline but perhaps Amazon.com should have a more accurate knowledge of when the item was (actually) shipped. This would reduce the buyer's anxiety of if and when the item would be received. This being a quality issue, Amazon.com still provides a great and valueable service to the consumer."
4,"Great movie, but no sub-titles","I have this movie (""Timepiece"") on VHS and love it, at least the amount of dialogue I can understand. Would like to have it on DVD, but it offers no sub-titles.This is a movie I will watch more than once a year. Interesting story, good acting, and teaches a great lesson: When you suffer a loss, doing something for someone else eases the pain and makes you feel SO much better when you see the happiness you've brought them!"
5,Great Holiday Surprise!,A friend of mine recommended this movie to me and I was so delighted! It was a great movie and I received it so fast I had it in time to view with family for Christmas!! I enjoyed Time Piece even more than Christmas Box! Both are great movies and I am so happy that people who don't have cable can see such amazing family orientated movies like these!
3,Okay,"The movie was okay,I think the price was a little too high for my price range,but other than that it was how it described."
5,Best Hallmark Movies Ever,"I can see why these two movies are now in collectible status. They are two of the best ever shown on Hallmark Channel. I was elated to be able to find them. The seller was great, too. Very prompt and the movies arrived in perfect shape. Thank you so much for making these collectibles available."
5,Wonderful DVD,"This is a great DVD, Watched in on Hallmark and looked all over for both stories. Finally found it. Great"
1,the hands are gold!,"The watch is described as steel, but for some strange reason the hands and numerals are gold. It's a very strange combination."
4,Loved this book!,I must have read this book 10 or more years ago. I can't find it anymore (probably lost in my house somewhere) but I have to buy it again. It's a fun book that's entertaining to read. I recommend it for anyone looking for a fun and quick book to read that also has some interest in technical stuff. The book isn't technical but I think it's my interest in all things tech that made it such a fun book to read.
2,somewhat entertaining but not worth the effort,Parts of the story were interesting but it completely failed to grab my interest. Some good ideas but they weren't fleshed out in.
5,It sets a high standard for reality-based computer fiction.,"New, top quality science-based fiction is getting scarce. It is refreshing to read a story that could really be happening. The premis was excellent as well as scarey for those of us who rely on PCs and the internet. It was easy to imagine myself in the story, not merely observing. Characters were a little two dimensional and innocent (or guilty) but that was a minor deterant from the overall enjoyment of the book. If there is any real criticism it is the fact that by time I read the book some of the technology was obsolete (although speech recognition is still in its infancy.) All-in-all a very enjoyable read and I pray Mr. Pogue will write more in the same vein."
4,I don't understand the sex scenes that bookend the story.,"I've read this book three times, most recently four or five years ago. It's entertaining and enjoyable, and an easy read.The copy I read, from the Durham County Public Library (of Durham, N.C.) was apparently a bit of a misprint, in that it contained the first and last chapters of what appears to be another novel dealing with geriatric sex before and after the book's actual prologue plus nineteen chapters."
5,Great investment,Bought a couple packs of these my students to make smore's at a bonfire. They are beyond perfect - nice length and very sturdy. They also clean easily. I'll probably use them this summer for kabobs. They seem like they should last for years to come
5,Great set of Skewers,I was very pleased with this product. The skewers are durable and easy to clean. Overall a great buy.
3,skewers,These items are nicely made and perfect for small backyard firepits. But keep in mind the length of the skewers...my young children have a hard time standing close enough to the fire to roast marshmellows without first roasting their cheeks!
1,real gar-baaage,The plastic handles immediately detached with the first use. Think about it. Plastic handles for a barbecue implement. Who is dumber: me for buying it and using it or amazon for selling it? They got the money and I got the weenie.
3,"Good gripability, but mediocre quality.","These skewers do a good job of providing an inner grip on your grillables, especially beef, which tends to slide around on flat skewers. However, after just a few uses, two of the handles have already fallen off."
5,Changed the way to grill vegetables,These skewers with the triangular edge hold food in position exactly as advertized. Turn the skewer and the food stays position on it not like on other skewers where the food merely spins around them. I have two sets for large gatherings.
5,Best Product for thick hair!,"This product works wonders for my thick, unruly hair. I know this line is designed for women of color, which I'm not, but this product was recommended to me. Now I always use it! I would highly recommend this product to anyone who has hair that is thick, difficult to manage, or dry. This product cured me of all those problems and now I can flat iron my hair without damage!"
5,"No, I didn't get a relaxer","I've been natural for 1 1/2 years now and it hasn't been easy finding products that help me achieve optimum straight results. My stylist used this on my wet hair, blew it dry with a hair dryer, then flat ironed it. The results are so good people think I relaxed my hair. This product has left my hair feeling silky and full of body. I'm posting this for the natural/kinky/curly ladies who sometimes seek straight hair days. Try this product. For those who are into hair typing, I don't know my exact hair type, but it is of varying degrees in the level 4 range."
2,Mona,"My stylist uses this sometimes, so I bought it. The smell was nice, but a little strong for me. Like someone else said, it's very perfume like, but not my taste.It didn't leave my hair shiny, but it did leave an unpleasant feel to it.I prefer Mizani's Thermasmooth Smooth Guard Serum; it's much lighter, in smell & texture."
3,Smells good...,"I've seen the stylist use this in salons, but I really am not impressed. It smells nice, but if it is just a protectant from CHI styling heat, that is fine. To me it doesn't add any special luster to the hair, so as long as it doesn't conflict with other styling products, its good by me. Quite pricey for little bottle, but it is a professional grade product, so anty up...."
4,Fiery Fingers revu,"Erle Stanley Gardner was a great author. This book is from the early 1950s and is ""typical"" of ESG's genius."
4,Finally the return of classic metal!,"This album and this band is classic metal,and this album will bring out the headbanger in all of us."
4,"So far, so good","I ordered these specifically to juggle with.They are big enough and heavy enough to give your arms and hands a good workout. However, the balls are tacky enough to make gripping them relatively easy.I recommend these balls for exercise, even though they're not really designed for the way I use them."
2,Sloppy industrial sludge.,"Soulstorm play a sludgey form of industrial metal. The riffs are very minimalistic and repetitive and the drum machine sounds like it came from the 80s. Think of early Prong slowed down to half speed with distorted vocals. I've read more favorable reviews for this album, so if you go for that sort of thing, disregard my rating and give this a try. Otherwise don't bother with it."
1,Truly Awful,"From the constant interruption of clumsy and intrusive exposition, commentary, lectures, and ramblings that bring the pacing of this story to a crawl, to the large and forgettable cast of cookie-cutter characters, this book is a great example of some of the most common mistakes in bad fiction. The one I found most irrating was the authors' refusal to consistently refer to characters using the same name.""Blah blah,"" said the Cree.""Blah blah,"" said Chandler.""Blah blah,"" said Mad Dog.""Blah blah,"" said Ed.""Blah blah,"" said Zinc.""Blah blah,"" said the sergeant.""Blah blah,"" said Ghost Rider.""Blah blah,"" said Rabidowski.Three different characters referred to in eight different ways on the same page. That's just bad writing."
2,Good First Chapter...Not Much Else,"I've rarely ever been so disappointed by novel I purchased as I was by Michael Slade's (Father and Daughter team) Death's Door.Before leaving the book store I had read the first chapter of the novel and was intrigued by the theft of the Mummy. And I when I read the back of the book I thought it held the possibility of maybe being a real page turner. However, as I've already said I was gravely disappointed by it.This book seemed to be more like a cheesey action film in print, with parts of a term paper on Egyptology thrown in for good measure inbetween. True, I have never read any other Slade works, and I know that Death's door is just a part in a series of novels dealing with the same character(s), so maybe I am lacking some necessary insight, but this is definitely a novel that sadly disappointed me."
3,"It's Michael Slade, you know what's coming.","Michael Slade, Death's Door (Cemetery Dance, 2003)Since Headhunter, the team pseudonymously known as Michael Slade have been cranking out thrillers that sit about as far out on the bleeding edge as thrillers get (you can find a bit more gore in the horror genre if you know where to look, but not by much). Death's Door continues the tradition. In this one, Special X (Special External Operations, a branch of the Mounties well-known to readers of Slade's novels) get sucked into investigating the discoveries of horribly mutilated bodies turning up on Canada's western shore. If you've read any of the series' recent novels, you've probably got a good idea of what's coming.Slade writes fast-moving novels that work like quick punches to the gut; the thriller reader with a taste for the perverse will find much between the covers to satisfy. ***"
2,miserably bruised book,"What a miserably bruised book. In place of intelligence we get hijacked history, forensic-behavioral extracts, cartoon character development and the adolescent clutter of the authors' sexualities. The rotten-souled villains all speak in the authors' bleak one-note calligraphy (a father daughter team no less). No de sade here. Only duh-sad."
3,Wonderful,This is wonderful for little ones but to be honest this things just kills my nerves but my daughter was hooked at the time she has now moved onto elmo.
1,Teletubbies- Silly Songs and Funny Dances,"This DVD may catch your childs attention, but I do not recommend this one. Content makes no sense. Sure it has bright colors- so does the sun. Instead buy Baby Einstein- we are collecting the series as we get money. At least with Baby Einstein you get Mozart, Bach, and something to learn. I see nothing to gain with Teletubbies except a blank stare from your child where there was no input other than watching guys in suits run around and play. Even Barney blows this away."
1,Caveat Emptor - Buyer Beware,"The title of the book is extremely misleading. The actual title should be, ""A Limited Glossary of Orthodox Terms, History, Theology, and Facts.""This volume is not a ""Comprehensive Encyclopedia"" in any manner. Don't make the mistake I made and buy this book, go to Wikipedia and find much more detailed content, or purchase an actual Encyclopedia of Christian thought.The book itself has some useful information, the content is just not what was advertised in the title."
2,Too many gaps,"Not a good reference work. The entries are to short, and the author did not manage to utilize the hundreds of pages well enough. 2 stars for the good concept, which is much needed, but this book is only half-way there.Get the Oxford Christian Dictionary instead!"
5,brand new book,This is a brand new book well packaged with CD in it. The book is well written in an understandable and systematic way.
4,A Creative Approach to Music Fundamentals (with CD-ROM),It is a very good book to introduce the basic knowledge for you to learn music.
5,"human, play FAST!!!",has been in automobile since purchase from relapse. only hope that sound system loud enough to inflict its malevolence onto the unsuspecting. eloquent articulation fails. only coursing need to destroy remains.
5,Pure Grind Fury,"If you have even a casual interest in grindcore or death metal, you need this album. Its truly amazing to hear David and Pete (of Morbid Angel fame) playing this crusty, nasty stuff. The production is flawless for the time period, sounding far more brutal and heavier than anything thats getting put out today. Just buy it and get your face shredded!"
3,Alfalfa cubes,I was disappointed in this product. The rabbits would not eat so I tried it for my desert tortoise! He wouldn't eat it either. Maybe the cubes were too hard - should they be soaked?I would not buy again.
2,nerdatheart,"They r ok: soft, flaky, fall apart very easily, my 3 guinea pigs r not crazy for them. They took a few nips off of one and have not went back. will not buy again. I gave it a 2, because it was a good price, but the alfalfa sticks r much harder and they like them, so I am going back to them."
3,Book Purchase,"Unfortunately, this product was never delivered so I cannot rate the product. However the seller was prompt with communication and a refund was issued."
2,Pretty Dreary Stuff,"To give credit where credit is due, there are some good action scenes, and the plot does more swiftly along the predictable course. But this is really rough going.To begin with, they have jazzed up the actions of the Navajo codetalker. Instead of showing what they mainly did -- sending coded messages about important logistics, intelligence, and operations functions -- we are shown them as code-talking basic artillery fire missions at small-unit level. I guess it is more exciting to have them screaming the Navajo code for, ""We need fire support, now!!!"" than reciting, ""We need 3000 howitzer shells within three days.""For the most part this is unojbectionable pulp -- barely edited (Marines wear ""boondoggers""?)."
4,A decent book,"Max Allan Collins gets a lot of work adapting screenplays into books and after reading Windtalkers I can understand why. Windtalkers isn't high art but it works on the level it is supposed to. Anything that keeps Americans READING is a good thing, as far as I'm concerned."
3,Grigo's Guide,"This book has excellent information on a Mexican kitchen and on dried and fresh chiles. It gives good clear definitions. That was my main reason for ordering it to add to my collection. The ingredient listings could have been in a little larger type-the same as the instructions to make them easier to read. Living in New Mexico all my life, where Mexican food is a staple, some of these recipes leave a little to be desired. These are not recipes I will probably use often. But I am pleased overall with my purchase."
1,Wrong Handle,"Be sure to read the product description before purchasing this. You will probably need to purchase new tips to fit the handle that comes with the hose. I would purchase them from Goodman's- not from another picture listed with this item. They may not necessarily be the right ones. While I had an issue with Goodman's on this initially, they made it right and I applaud their concern for their customers!"
1,Do not buy this!,I should have paid more attention to the previous reviews. This replacement part is not the same as the one on the original WaterPik. None of the tips will fit. I was not satisfied with what they sent me so I returned it in their box with the return label. Boy was I surprised when they did not accept the return and sent it back to me. I made lots of waves with Amazon who did finally refund my account.Do yourself a favor and spend $30 more and buy a new WaterPik
1,"Won't work, waste of money.....","You are wasting your money on this repair kit. The hose breaks because it is brittle. It will eventually break at a point where you no longer can attach replacement hose at the unit or wand end. Thus - your WaterPik is ready for the trash can.Hmmm, is this by design. Has a ""consumable"" been built in to this great product? I think so.For this reason, I will buy no more WaterPiks. Surely, better design can come up with a hose formulation that does not become brittle."
3,Suggestion For Replacing Assembly,"My review is strictly meant to help others who are having difficulty attempting to replace the handle assembly including the hose. I purchased the identical kit directly from the Waterpik-Store for $8.99 plus P&H; total $12.94. However, the item shown is the same thing. Very easy installation/replacement. This chore was completed in approximately 10 minutes. My unit is WP-100When reading other reviews I noted another member who suggested using the Waterpik Store as well. Good Luck"
1,Don't waste your money,"Do not waste your money !!! Did not work - leaked like a sieve. Cost me $13 with shipping. I could have applied that to the purchase of a new water-pik. I would not order this product again, and I would not recommend it."
1,Kit does not work,"I purchased the WaterPik repair kit (then subsequently had to order new ""piks"" as the old ones did not fit in the new handle). After one week the new hose blew out of the old hose where it was connected as the old hose had developed a tear at the connection site. This was a complete and total waste of time and money. Why WaterPik doesn't make a kit to replace the part that you can unscrew underneath the unit that has the hose connection and the assembly then connects directly to the pump...but I quess we all know THAT answer; they want you to have to purchase an entire new unit! Do not waste your money on this useless kit."
1,a waste on money and energy,"Following the instructions, it's very difficult to attach the new hose to the old. After managing doing so, it leaked at the connection. I redid it three times. Questioned, Waterpik suggested me to buy a new machine!"
5,exactly what I needed,"I was not able to splice it into the old tube. The old tube inside diameter was too small so the splicing connector would split the tube. I was however able to remove the old tube completely and attach the new tube to the pump. Works fine. This is not recommended if you have no ""DIY fix it"" skills..."
1,Don't Waste Your Money,"Do not buy this kit. The reason your hose broke to begin with is it has become brittle with age. Thus, the plastic connector that attaches the new hose line to the old hose will continue to break through the old hose side. As well, the new hose will not stay lodged into the tip connector. I have even tried the heating method, to try to 'shrink wrap' the hose safely onto the connector. And, waterpik (thoughtfully) allows no access to attach the new hose directly to the motor (which would alleviate one of these problems). So we are all stuck replacing our waterpiks every 18 - 24 months, as I have done for about 15 years now."
2,Waterpik Hose Repair Kit,"I had no problem splicing the hose according to the instructions. I was surprised to find out, however, that the new handle did not accept the jet tips that came with my Waterpik. I had to order new ones -- ""BRJ"" tips. Amazon should advise customers ordering this hose repair kit about the need for the different tips, so that they can order them at the same time. The delay and extra shipping cost were irritating."
3,water pik repair,"I'm not really cheap, more like frugal. My waterpik is 16 months old and the hose broke at the handle. It would kill me to buy a new one over a broken hose. I got a small screwdriver and pryed the bushing out that holds the hose in. got a needle nose pliers and pulled out the small piece of old hose,slide the bushing back on the hose, Push the hose back into the handle and push the bushing back in. And wala, cheap Joe is back in business for freeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeee."
1,Do not buy,I agree with the other reviewer. The old hose is too brittle. Save your money and buy a new irrigator. My Waterpik lasted about 7 years.
4,Water pik hose repair kit,"comes with an insert tip so you can just cut the existing hose and insert the new one without taking the waterpick apart. I chose to take apart and go directly to the pump inside. Product worked well, need to use hairdryer to soften end and glue if you attach it directly to the pump, worked well none the less.Glad I paid no attention to the negative write ups have a 10 yr old pik that's now like new. Bought a brand new pick for another bathroom since I think water pik products could outlast your teeth"
2,Waterpik hose repair kit,I have had this product for over two weeks and still cannot connect the hoses. I have had others with more strength than me try and they cannot do it either. I am still not able to use the appliance. Very disappointed. And the extra piece of hose--what is that for??
5,Yea - it's worth it,"I have hundreds of books and manuals on various techie subjects and Ellen's AutoCAD 2004 Bible ranks high on my list for books worth the purchase. I have used AutoCAD for years but after moving up to Acad 2005 from Acad 2000 I thought I could use some tutoring. The book didn't disappoint. For nearly every topic there is a step by step, hands-on, example that the reader can perform. There are around 160 drawing files on the accompanying CD; one for each example in the book. You can open that file in Acad and follow the steps in the book and experiment to your heart's content.All in all, this book won't disappont you like some I could mention."
1,Blah,I liked this album a lot better when it was called Brother by Cry of Love.see also;I liked this album a lot better when it was called Shake Your Money Maker by The Black Crowes.
2,Who owns a CD player anymore?,The guys who encoded this so that it installs malware on your PC should be beaten with sticks. I refuse to listen to this CD in its current state because I don't care to go through the hassle of actually listening to it on CD player.
1,Couldn't Play,"I tried for an hour to get the CD to play and couldn't. It skipped and sounded garbled. There is a BMG support website that offers advice, but even after I did everthing they said I could not get this CD to play. I think it would be great if I could hear it, I have heard their music before, but I cannot recommend this particular issue because the copy protection on it prevents honest purchasers from using the disk."
2,Stop Comparisons,"For the love of God, this does not sound like GNR. GNR were street rats covered in flies, with bad attitudes and heroin addictions. They were angry, pissed off and self imploded within 5years. This sounds like garage kids playing black crowes covers. It aint that good. Foxhole Jesus is an ok cut same with S.F.C. But anywho, if you like a bad version of the black crowes, this will be your bag."
1,The worst band in the world...ever!,For those who think leather pants look good. They don't they look sad and so is this cd. Why do the record companies release this rubbish. Don't waste your money.
5,This band is AWESOME!,"Released in September, 2004, this is one cd you will want to listen to over and over again! Silvertide consists of Walt Lafty (vocals), Nick Perri (lead guitar), Brian Weaver (bass guitar), Mark Melchiorre Jr. (rhythm guitar), and Kevin Frank (drums). From Mary Jayne to Heartstrong, Show & Tell will rock your socks off. Lafty shows that he can take a fast beat (Ain't Comin' Home)...then turn it around to a more mellow sound (Nothing Stays). Lead guitarist Perri really cranks it up and hits the top on songs like Devil's Daughter and Mary Jayne. The entire band works as one entity with a sound like no other band currently out there. This band is relatively new but definitely up and coming! With a sound like theirs you will only crave more....You'll ""Want it All""! Highly recommended!!"
5,rock n balls out roll are back,well not before time back to basics crunching guitars rasping vocals excellent song writing rock and roll is still alive and kicking all you people out there get this album you really missing the point
4,Can You Say Southern Fried Rock!!,"Yup, these guys are indeed a very southern sounding band. It reminds me a lot of the Black Crowes, but it's meaner and heavier. From the first spin I really got into the overall picture this cd puts forth. It's good southern rock & roll that's for sure and I'm recommending it for those who like that style of music.I saw these guys open up for Van Halen a few years back and they were awesome. Nuff Said!!"
5,YES,"This album is excellent. It does nothing but rock. And that, my friend, is all you can ever ask for."
5,ABSOLUTELY INCREDIBLE !!!!,I have been playing music for almost 15 years and have long missed true rock. That is exactly what this band does... ROCK !I won't even attempt to compare them to bands of the past but there is certainly a little of all the great bands of the past tied into each song. THIS ALBUM IS AN ABSOLUTE MUST HAVE !! I am confident that it won't be long before they top the charts. My only hope is that they will stay there and other bands will follow suit. I love the new grunge rock and punk rock but this album has reminded me what rock REALLY is.
5,Silvertide must see live,"I got to see Silvertide in concert a few days before the cd was released. The show was so great, I was really ticked I'd have to wait the 4 days till the cd came out. The band opened for another band, but I could have happily just listened to them continue... The band was also very gracious and stayed outside their bus to take pictures and sign autographs. I got them to sign the promotional post card they were giving out advertising the cd, and I've placed it inside my cd cover. Definitely a great cd, and an even better live if you get the chance. :)"
5,A rock revival,"Im from the UK and heard of silvertide through magazine's and thought i ought to get the album, to try them out. I can honestly say i was blown away, i thought the glory days of classic rock were long gone but this album really does lead me to believe different. silvertide will be huge soon and this album is a perfect start. They are the complete rock package and show and tell is a mix of led zeppelin/ac/dc etc with a modern rock edge. All the songs contain catchy riffs and vocal passages. Standout tracks have to be devils daughter aint coming home and california rain which are all hard rock tracks but also i love the ballad heartstrong."
3,Uncertain literary goal,"My initial response to the book was very negative for reasons expressed by other reviewers. Limited character development particularly of the supporting characters, somewhat plodding and disjointed, insufficient context either both in the present and historically. I wonder though if that is exactly what the author was aiming to do. Cady has insulated herself from her past, her very self and her personal and professional circle. Written from her vantage point, it is no wonder that there was little revealed about these people; she has no real relationship with any of them and sees them strictly through her own fears and expectations.Nor do they know anything significant about her....nothing to develop. This thought did not lead me to like the book any more, but did cast in in a somewhat more positive light."
3,Somewhat bewildered,"I found the premise of this book to be extraordinarily interesting; however, unlike some other reviewers, I did not find that it fulfilled its early promise. It seemed to plod along without any particular insights into Cady. Her husband was an enigma to me - and his relationship to his mother was vaguely disturbing. I think it is an average book. It didn't leave me with any lingering thoughts - on the contrary, I felt disappointed that there wasn't more to this book."
3,Nastalia's Review,"This book was a wonderful book that kept my attention the whole time. Being that I took AP Biology this year, I connected alot of Biology terms in the book. I thought the story line was good, and it really showed a mother who cared for her son, maybe a little too much. The only thing i would change about this book would be the ending. I would have given the book a 4, but the ending kinda made me upset. To be frank, I hated the ending, but the whole book was really good and I would recomend it to anyone who reads. Cai Emmons is a great writter and I hope to read more of her books. She shows a lot of potential for becoming the next big writter. I hope, personally, she writes a book that follows this one up, becuase it kinda leaves you hanging at the end. All in all, i loved it!"
3,Not quite as advertised,"The Amazon review is wrong. It sounds like Metal Blade just took selected tunes from ""Behold the Beginning,"" added the track ""Lightning to the Nations"" and came up with some new packaging. Whether it's worth the freight for the one ""new"" track is debatable. Still, Diamond Head is Diamond Head and it's good listening if you can stomach the cheesy electronic drums."
2,This is a bad remix of the awesome original.,"Metal Blade decided to commemorate Diamond Head by re-releasing this incredible album. Unfortunately, they decided to remix the sound, and it was a HUGE mistake. Now some of the songs actually have a disco-like drum sound, the vocal tracks they used are not all the originals, and in general they really screwed up a great album. Stick with the vinyl if you can find it, but if you can't then this will have to suffice. It is still Diamond Head which is why it got two stars; Metal Blade should get no stars for this abortion."
5,I think b(if)tek's totally dishy,"b(if)tek isn't ambient. b(if)tek isn't progressive. And it definitely isn't house - even though one half of this duo is from Sydney, a very house-loving city.b(if)tek is just totally dishy.The duo of Nicole Skeltys and Kate Crawford have come up with some deliciously infectious grooves. Their sound is multi-layered. And you just don't want the title track to end, the hook in it is so good.Also check out their new release 'Wired for Sound'."
4,USUAL SMITH BEAUTIFUL PEOPLE GREAT STORY,A LIFE OF EVERYDAY PEOPLE THROUGH THE BLURRED EYES OF MR SMITH. HE SEES LIFE FROM A SMALL TIME ZAMBIAN POINT OF VIEW COUPLED WITH THE SENSE OF HUMOUR OF A TYPICAL NATALIAN.
4,"I needed this book for class, but I am enjoying it .",I purchased the book because it was assigned for my world history class. I expected it to be dry and straightforward. However that is has not been the case so far. I have read about five chapters and the book postulates interesting and fun theories about human development.
1,Poorly Written Book with a Lacking Main Idea,"I found that this book's central idea of the various webs that have connected mankind through the course of history is supported with many details that are too specific. For example, the book talks about how the camel connected Western and Eastern Africa, namely the Ghanaian Empire and the Wangara tribe. Nevertheless, this book presented that material which could have easily been summarized in a paragraph in one chapter. This makes the writing very boring to read. Also, there are multiple chapters in this book that are devoted to the camel. It touches various details of each culture that are completely unnecessary and doesn't go into depth with any of these details. It brushes every culture but none of its details would make any sense to anyone with prior background knowledge. This is book can be understood properly but I believe it needs some complementary education. For this reason I am giving the book one star."
5,Ocean liners,"Any thing by William Miller regarding nautical subjects is excellent. This and it's companion volume ""The Great Luxry liners"" are essential reading for anyone interested in this important era. I only wish someone with his talents would do a series on freighters and tankers of the 20th century."
3,nice!,"This is very helpful,I like it!The only thing I dont like it is that you can not choose the color."
3,OK spaghetti measure,The tool is a little difficult to use because you have to hold onto the spaghetti and insert in the measure. It was just a little awkward...but I like it and will continue use. It's a good value.
3,S[aghetti Measurer,"I wasn't to crazy about this project. It was hard to hold the spaghetti,and try to put it through the hole. Maybe it was the way I was doing it."
2,No serving sizes!,"It's not helpful to receive a tool that only notes ""1 serving"", ""2 serving"", etc. without noting how much that is! What are we talking about here? A cup? A half cup? Very important to know!"
2,How much do you eat?,"Overall the product does work, just be careful. I use the smallest circle for 2 servings, not 1. I found this out the hard way. At least now I know and can consistently make the same amount of spaghetti each time."
5,Spagetti Measure,"Very useful - glad we found this. We used to have one, but misplaced it. Works great (but the servings are a big large, so we adjust downward)."
3,correction....!,with all due respect to arthur brown...i think the first band to experiment with eletronica...by 3 years was a band (2 guys who's names escape me..) called tontos expanding headband...great stuf...
5,Fast shipping,It only took a couple days to receive the switchplates. I love them. Great for any Lucy fan.
1,carlin lover,"I enjoy George Carlin and have purchased many of his DVD's and books. This DVD might have been very funny in 1986 however it does not transfer well into todays world of 2005. It's almost like the difference between jokes an 8 year old tells and the jokes you hear later on in adulthood(This being the 8 year olds jokes). I feel like I was mislead by the 4 and a half star rating. If you are looking for something that is not very funny this is for you! Otherwise don't get ripped off like I did, this is definately NOT worth the price. I was left wondering ""Where is the funny?"" Save your money or buy one of his more recent DVD's that are truely great and full of laughs."
3,A soulful and gifted voice,"Excellent concert, however, the quality of the video is challenging. The sound quality is adequate however, DVD was a good purchase."
5,She's so lovely!,Dionne Warwick provides an exceptional artistic rendition of various hits from the 60s and 70s in this DVD. She's such a classy lady and the silken-voiced chanteuse does not disappoint her fans. No one can do it quite like Ms. Warwick and she proves it time and time again with her timeless musical essence.
1,"unspeakable, all right","Husbancds [sic] are to love their wivesThis is not something you learnThen wives will submit to the Godly love in youIt is more than enough in returnAs your wife sees you give yourself for herAt all times and not just a fewShe will know you are submitted to GodSo for her there is nothng you won't do...No kidding, this is the kind of stuff you'll read in the book. There's some confusion about the author, though. ""Harold"" is apparently the daddy, no doubt the personage whose autodidact goodness is portrayed in the lines above. Yet press reports (available at the book's website) claim that this business is actually written by his daughters, one of whom has a name beginning with ""E"", and one of whom has a name beginning with ""C"", yielding the ""pen name"" ""E.C.Miller"". Now who is it? Did daddy or his dutiful daughters pen this pensive pap? Which? Is this an example of what old-fangled family-valued Anglo American Christianity can do to youngsters' minds, or to an adult's?"
4,"The epitome of the word ""Old School""...","""From Beyond"" is the very definition of Old School Death Metal, and as such, it it virtually the benchmark against which all other ""Old School"" releases should be judged... Kam Lee's voice is still unmatched as far as depth goes... This is the remastered edition with the ""Inhuman Condition"" EP included."
3,most songs are generic death metal,"Most of this is generic and dull. But one track (which by the way doesn't sound very 'Death Metal') is awesome - Defeat Remains. It has a very ""pantera-ish"" riff that sounds like the riff from pantera's 'Domination'. Also, the main riff sounds kind of prong-like. It is a very good tune, and unlike anything else Massacre has penned. Maybe they should have gone in that direction."
4,No lil wayne but its still hot,The truth is sqad up is better with weezy but they can hold there own and this album is still fire despite the best member being absence from the crew
3,Sqad was better with Wayne,"I used to love listening to the Underground SQAD albums, but when SQ left Lil Wayne they lost a lot of talent. Sure the SQAD has talent, but without a leader they aren't much."
5,Audio/visual delight,"Had a foot massage at a spa and was seated in a darkened room with this video playing on a large flatscreen. Both my feet and my eyes were treated to 60 minutes of total relaxation. When I'm rushing to an evening meeting or on a tight schedule, I play on my home TV and its so calming, it's almost hypnotic!"
1,not impressed,"Took a full day and two people to build, metal was bent (not damaged beyond use or I'd go to the effort to ship it back), some shelves don't fit properly without hammering them in.Instructions were terrible - lacking and unclear.The colored bins are all gray despite the photo (go by the description) and the bottom bins are shown as larger in the picture, but are all the same size. Never judge a book by it's cover I suppose."
3,No beltclip and wrong charger.,"Although the product arrived quickly (4 days) I was disappointed when I realized that there was no belt clip with the order, and no means of attaching the Silicon skin to a belt. Also, rather than receiving a 12v car charger, I received a wall outlet charger. There is no information on the invoice regarding how to rectify this either. The skin and armband seem to work well enough, but I could have got that for 1/2 the price that I paid for this."
3,Lots of shorty short sexy stories,"The 10 stories in this book are hot and mostly good: two I really liked (those by Angela Knight and Kate Douglas) and the others are enjoyable. There is only one story that was so bad - bad story, bad writing - I did not even finish it. Every story presents a paranormal caracter and a holiday (Christmas + Vampire, St.Valentine's + St.Valentine, 4th of July + Troll, St.Patrick's + Pooka, etc.) Also, as the stories are so short, they go quickly to the point (which is, hum... sex. With a happy end, of course).All in all, the buy is worth it."
4,Quite a good book.,"Like all anthologies there are some really good authors and some that are unknown to you. This knew was no different. Many of the stories were enjoyable, a few not quite. Overall a good read."
1,Such a disappointment!,I bought this book because I like Angela Knight and like anthologies to find new authors - what a disappointment. The whole series of novellas is very average -- I don't recommend this one.
4,You must remember that this is Playboy and not Hustler!,"Playboy is known for the ""art"" it uses when showing off women. This DVD is no exception. The ""locker room"" is one on the set of a gym (one that you would use to lift weights). I would say that the best scene is seeing the girl on a treadmill nude. Of course, there are other scenes that are good as well. Of all the Playboy DVD's I own, this is my favorite (thus why I am reviewing it for you). I also own Playboy's Truth or Dare Exposed DVD. That is a lame game of Truth or Dare. Don't get it. It's embarrassing. Trust me, I am trying real hard to see what a girl looks like naked. I hope Playboy can help me. So, if you wish to see some boucing boobies or some watery pussies, this is for you. There you go."
3,Good but not great,"I needed this book for a paper I was writing. It was an informative read but it was not organized in a way that flowed. It was hard to find exactly what I needed for my research, therefore for those who are writing a paper and only have a month to do it (along with papers for three other classes) and need to use at least ten resources, I recommend not using this book because you really need the time to read everything."
5,Good exposure for children to lots of adjectives!,Lots of use of adjectives in this story about a monkey's efforts to find his mother with the help of a butterfly who keeps leading the monkey to wrong species mothers.As recommended on my children's book recommendation site Books for Children (www.books-for-children.com)
3,Left a Bad Taste in my Mouth,"I thought this would be like the other Smoothie Concepts. Which are suppoesd to have a neutral flavor and specially blended for smoothies. This one may be, but there is always a metallic taste left over. I am going to experiment with using less, which means it's not a full days supply. Otherwise this would be a perfect thing, but it messes up the taste and it is noticable."
3,Nice....just nice,"I'm not sure if the manga came before or after the anime, but the manga feels weak when compared to the anime. Maybe because the humor seems to fall flat in the book? Maybe the action in the anime seems to move faster? The setting and rules of the fantasy world seem to bounce all over. What's the history of the world? Can everybody do magic or just a few people? Slapstick works better on the television than on the printed page. Get it used if you wish to get it at all."
2,"Good TV Series, Not Good Manga","Unfourtanetly American publishers chose the wrong manga to publish. This stand alone Slayers manga is not as good as the actual series the TV show is based upon, and is not really worth buying. Look for some better Slayers manga in the future, but leave this one, unless you are truly suffering from Slayers withdrawal."
4,Grammar workbooks,"These grammar workbooks are great for reviewing grammar with plenty of exercises to do. My one complaint is they don't have examples for the kids to see. For example, what part of a sentence is a simple predicate? They give the definition and instructions to underline the simple predicate, but even the definition can be difficult to understand without a visual example. Thankfully they have the answers in the back, so I can help my children understand and give them the example they need."
5,IT REALLY WORKS!,"ENOUGH MONEY really works! Mr. Vodra has developed a sensible and practical approach to managing one's personal financial life. His ""Seven Rules of Prosperous Living"" are easy to understand and follow. After reading his book and completing a ""Lifetime Balance Sheet"", I have managed to begin a savings plan and almost eliminate my credit card debt in a few short months. I highly recommend Mr. Vodra's approach to gaining financial freedom."
4,Particularly Good RE: Legal Corruption of Jury System,"Bertsch, a lawyer himself, should be commended for speakingout on serious problems in our legal system today. I foundthe book particularly good regarding the jury system andhow it has been corrupted by lawyers and judges. Bertschalso covers other problems such as the lawsuit mess inAmerica and advertising by lawyers.His writing jumps around and does not seem well organized,but the anecdotes are great and the reading is still good.(unless perhaps you're a lawyer or judge).Bertsch offers remedies to the problems he enumerates. Ifind the problem with many of his remedies is that they aretoo complex and involved - rather like one would suspect alawyer to think, I suppose.Overall, Bertsch has done a service by bucking the tide,and I consider it recommend reading."
5,An excellent quick reference,"I bought this slim little book when I was first taking Calculus in High School. It helped me immensely with learning and studying Calculus, and provided a great refresher come test time. Since then, I have sometimes needed a formula, and this manual has again been very useful. Calculus is one of those things you forget if you don't use it, and I was in danger of forgetting it when I took a Physics class which required a basic knowledge of Calculus. Thanks in part to this little book, I was able to brush up on the subject and be prepared for my class, though it has been several years since I first learned Calculus in High School and I have had little occasion to use it since.This quick review will provide an excellent study guide for anyone, like myself, who doesn't use Calculus in everyday life but still doesn't want to forget it. It has definitely proved to be worth its weight in gold for me!"
5,Great Supplement to Your Thick Calc Textbook,"I would not of survived Calculus I without this handy little book. For a quick review and as a study guide, you cannot beat this little book when compared to your 900 page textbook."
2,A sip of Calculus,"This book is barely a review, all it does is state the core concepts. You will neither understand nor be able to use much of what you learn to do in this book, except perhaps the limits section. I'd rather use this as a reference guide than as an outline. For a better outline which presents you with a better background before you delve deep into the topic of Calculus and explains topics and gives you an insight on the theorems, get Schaum's outline of Calculus. Otherwise, get this as a last resort."
4,Helpful.,"I took Calculus II in college as a first semester freshman and it helped me a bunch when figuring out the derivatives and integrals of some functions (the trigs especially).It has a really helpful table as its first page which I used the most.I frankly did not read the book so I don't know what else is in there.Oh and it had integral of cosine wrong.But I wouldn't really buy this since you can find all the information online, although it is helpful to have it all in one sheet."
2,"Useful only if you are reviewing for an examination of ""plug and chug"" differentiation and integration problems","Unless you are preparing to take a calculus exam consisting of a series of basic differentiation and integration problems, then I really don't see any use for this book. The reviews of what differentiation and integration really are have no depth to them, so those sections are of limited use in bringing you back up to speed in calculus.This makes the book almost totally a collection of sections of the form:Here is a type of mathematical expression and this is how we differentiate (integrate) it, with some examples.One of my college math professors referred to these problems as ""plug and chug"", where you simply execute the rules without having any real understanding of the concept. Therefore, if you are trying to refresh your understanding of calculus, then this book will be of little value."
4,Pretty Good,"I did not give this book five stars because I felt Chriss didn't talk about Gouldner's ""Darkside of the Dialectic"" trilogy enough, and most Gouldner scholars agree that those three books are by far Gouldner's most insightful and significant. In particular, I was disappointed that Chriss didn't talk about the role intellectuals play in revolutionary activity. Chriss is clearly one of those men who believe that intellectuals are intrinsically good-hearted and are not capitable of being evil or cunning or power-hungry (how David Riesman can you get!). They must just have their nose in books all day and have zero interest in personal ambition or political matters. Keep dreaming! The best insight Gouldner ever had was one shared by Nietzsche and Ayn Rand: Watch out for the intellectuals, they are the most dangerous people on the planet."
5,Great book!,Thank you for quick and reliable service. The item arrived as scheduled in the condition it was described on amazon.
1,Not My Type,"I love V.C. Andrews books, but Ruby and Melody were the ones that I hated the most. I hope that Giselle girl doesn't come after me, but if you do it's just my opinion. I thought that Ruby was a nice girl, but she kept on letting Giselle get her into trouble instead of fighting back like she should've. That showed that she was weak. I admired her for leaving from Paul after finding out that they were related, but I didn't even read the second book when I found out that they would get married. Bless V.C. Andrews's soul, but once she passed the ones writing her books have been ruining her name."
2,Not one of the best,"I first began reading V.C. Andrews because of the flowers in the attic Dollanganger series. I have also read the casteel series and enjoyed that. However, this was one of my least liked V.C. Andrews BOOKS. The main character is too gullible, is too much the victim and comes off as unintelligent. Did not enjoy the ending and do not think I will buy the rest of the series books. Unfortunate."
5,A Awesome book,My moms friend introduce me to V.C. Andrews last year I've read all the series and this series is so sad and great at the same time I recomend any V.C. Adrews books to anyone. Ruby is one of my favorite books ever.
4,First love and first betrayal are in this book.,"You get to experience the innocence of Ruby fading away as she steps into life. No longer shadowed by the Bayou she longs for a larger more unshielded life. As she go on, lots of her past which was unbeknownst to her is unveiled."
4,"Straight forward, very interesting.","""Ruby"" was the 9th book of V.C. Andrews that I had read. I thought it was very interesting and when I started it, i stayed up all night to finshed. I can't wait to start ""Pearls in the Mist"" and finsh the series. This book is much more straight forward than some of the other series, I could easily explain this book to someone, but i'm sure it would take a lot longer to explain the Logan or Cutler. Overall, I recommend this book to read strongly."
5,Great book!,"The whole Landry series is great. It's the best one V.C. Andrews wrote so far. Even though Ruby is the main character in the book, her twin sister , Gisselle, steals the show. Her character's back-stabbing and manipulations bring out the series. Her stepmother, Daphne, does so also.Ruby is too goody-goody. That's the reason the character Giselle outshines her with her sterotypical stuck-up rich girl act. You'll love this book. Even though Gisselle is manipulative, you'll love her, too."
5,Ruby,"After reading The Flowers in the Attic series I began the Ruby series. I am drawn into V.C. Andrews writing style because she incorporates twist and turns in fate with little detection, leaving the reader shocked and astonished when they learn the truth. I also enjoy how she weaves deceitful people into her plots. In the story of Ruby the deceit of numerous people led to the sequence of obstacles a young girl must overcome after her grand-mere passes on and she learns the scandalous circumstances of her conception and birth. Upon discovery, Ruby sets out on an adventure to discover a whole new world, with a whole new family. I admire her for her courage and heart to do as she promised her grand-mere on her death bed because the challenges she faced would have made many crumble to nothing but dirt on the bottom of ones' shoe. I cannot wait to continue reading the series to see where the path lain for Ruby will take her. Will she succeed in the ""rich world"" or will she retreat back to the bayou?"
2,A CAJUN SOAP OPERA--,Some interesting characters but the story drags at times and I'm not in to depressing sagas.
5,Totally cool book!,I first read the Ruby Landry series when I was 11. I fell in love with the series. I've read it 15 times since I read it the first time. V.C. Andrews was a great writer. I want to be a writer like her one day.
4,A review from Holland,"Dear Readers of Virginia Andrews, I have enjoyed this book very much, and can't wait to read the next. I have read the Dutch version of this book. This one is one of my favourites. I can assure you that this is the most pleasurable time spending there is, reading this book. I hope you will enjoy this as much as I did."
5,Ruby is simply BRILLIANT!!,As soon as you open the cover you are transformed into a different world. A world of a young girl that is trapped because of her family's past action. This is a book of entrancement which will not let you put it down!
3,"Not one of Andrews' best, but. . . .","she didn't technically write it; it was one of those ""post-humously"" released titles. VC Andrews' formula is more apparent in this series than anywhere else I've seen. It's no ""Flowers in the Attic"", but I'll keep buying these books. Who knows, maybe they'll hire a more talented ghost writer with my money"
4,good book,"it took me quite a few months to get through this book b/c the beginning was so boring, and didn't get good,unfortunately, until about more than half way through. i didn't appreciate everyone's spoiling reviews on here, either, when I was first reading the reviews, esp. the one who tells you what HAPPENS in the following 2 books... my favorite series is still the Cutler series,though."
3,Good starter guitar.,Good guitar. The pattern doesn't show up as much as this picture on the site does - which is good.
3,"Nice Graphics, Lacking in Some Substance","There are three qualities I rate in a documentary:A. Quality of the Host/interviewees....3 starsB. Quality of Graphics...4 starsC. Quality of Information...2 starsSome of the material seemed dumbed down, not terribly probing or well delivered. Some of the topics that I had some knowledge about, I felt like somebody was telling me a joke, but leaving off the punchline, like the whole discussion about the presence of Helium-3 on the moon, which constitutes a future fuel source...but why? They could have spent 5 minutes explaining the future of nuclear fusion (if there really is one)...not just saying Helium-3 is a future energy source. Overall, the documentary was somewhat broad, but quite shallow, sort of Mars for Star Trek fans. I did like it, but might buy something else if I had a do-over."
5,Evgueni Khaldei - Photographer Under Stalin [VHS] by Evguei eni Khald,"a fabulous documentary about one of the greatest yet not generally known photo journalists. fascinating and very moving life story, superb images."
3,Stick with the computer versions,"Having owned and loved the entire series in computer format, I was excited when I heard Sims2-Pets for the Wii was alot like them. The gameplay and storyline ARE very similar. However, the controls are difficult to figure out, and even harder to master. You have to concentrate so much on hitting different combinations of buttons to preform even simple functions that your interest in the story is pretty much lost. I really wanted to love this game, but the poor controls make playing feel like work."
2,Doesn't work after one play.,"There are no visible scratches or scuffs but every time I try to load it it reverts back to the Wii home screen. Kinda bummed. I loved this game. My toddler destroyed my first one and now this one doesn't work. But! I did wait too long to return or review it, so it's my bad on the money lost."
3,help,How do I make the sims people speak english? it is very annoying and frustrating because you cant understand it.
2,Horrible!,"This is the worst game I have ever played. I never tried any of the SIMS games before, and after someone recommended this one to my husband, he bought it for me. It was on sale for 14.99. I was never interested in this game so If it hadnt been on sale I would have returned it to the store. So...I tried playing this game and the SIMS dont even speak English?? I dont know what they are saying! There are no instructions other then how to make your characters and what your SIMS need. I found it very difficult to understand what to do. I went into the town and got stuck there for 1 hour, literaly! The character went into the bathroom every minute. This game is extemely boring and very annoying. Dont buy this unless you speak Russian and have a very boring life!"
2,NEW BUT USED!,"I BOUGHT THE ""KEYS OF JESHUA"" SECOND HAND FROM AMAZON, THE WRITE UP SAID USED BUT NEW. WHEN THE BOOK ARRIVED I OPENED IT TO START READING AND FOUND THAT JUST ABOUT EVERY PAGE IN THE BOOK HAS DIFFERENT COLOURED PEN MARKS UNDER CERTAIN PASSAGES ON THE PAGES. THE PREVIOUS OWNER OBVIOUSLY USED THIS BOOK EXTENSIVELY AND WANTED TO REMEMBER THESE PASSAGES. I WOULD HAVE LIKED TO HAVE CHOSEN MY OWN PASSAGES TO REMEMBER.THANK YOUMRS. C.Y. THOMPSONPORT ELIZABETHSOUTH AFRICA"
4,not as good as the ones in Mexico,These are good but not nearly as good as the ones we would buy in Mexico. These are especially crunchy and much more batter than the ones you find in other countries. They are still a great snack though and really nice for parties
5,Crunchy good,"Excellent crunch. Very fresh. Big size bags. These are not exactly what you enjoy in Mexico, but they are very close. Great flavor. For anyone that has never had these or the ones in Mexico, they are in for a real treat. Just add to your super saver freight order and the price is well worth it."
4,"Good product, but...","The product is fine, but it is not similar to Brazilian Japanese style peanuts neither in taste nor in the type of peanut. This product tastes sweet and very crunchy and uses Viriginia (large) peanuts. Brazilian Japanese style peanuts are salty (due to the use of soy sauce) and use ""Spanish"" (small) peanuts."
2,Just ok,"This Japanese peanut is not even close to be as good as the Brazilian Japanese style. It is a little sweet for my taste and a bit hard, too."
3,I don't know man,"Don't get me wrong from the star rating, I'm sure that this is a very good album, but I just couldn't handle it. I like the albums that AF made before this one, and the ones that they made after. Cause For Alarm is a classic, as is Something's Gotta Give, but this in-betweener is just not for me and it may or may not be for you. If Agnostic front appeals to you for their Street-hard metal characteristics, then you'll probably like this but if you're more into it for the hard-core punk then this album has a bit of that too but it is mostly laced in menacing metal. And I must explain myself again- by metal I don't mean Metallica-type garbage, it's still hardcore in the end. There are lots of wild guitar solos (courtesy of Matt Henderson, now in Madball with Roger Miret's little bro) which I don't really like. I don't find that they compliment the songs. But you may want to check it out anyways because it may be for you."
3,Hardcore,"This release sets the pace for the future Agnostic Front releases and pretty much coins the term ""Hardcore"" for music. A staple for any fan of this style!"
5,Interesting design for Jerusalem cross,"I APPRECIATED THE FAST SERVICE AND THE OUTSTANDING QUALITY OF THE ORDERED CROSS, and THAT IT HAD A CHAIN INCLUDED FOR THE PRICE. I WOULD ORDER AGAIN FROM THIS COMPANY."
5,a magnetic book,"i couldn't put this book down for 2 days. the story of taliesin is a new one and the male point of view for kennealy is also new. this is much better than even ""the hawk's gray feather"" ""the oak above the kings"".you'll love it. don't try to start one without having both of the others with you."
2,Tries hard but can't go full steam ahead,"I have a few positive statements regarding this novel. The book is an easy read over a weekend or while waiting at airports. It will not scholastically exhaust you nor keep you awake at night pondering some esoteric message. Unfortunately it will not excite, enthuse, or tantalize you. It's plot was trite, its ""twists"" predictable, and its characters one dimensional. The story line is detracted by the author's seeming adolescent obsession with physical appearance (""with looks that got her chosen college homecoming queen""). There are too many other great mysteries to read. Don't waste your time here."
3,It sure beats Higgins,"Well, this is a fairly interesting novel, with a twist reminding of A.Christie, despite having a number of unnecessary subplots and flat characters including rather benign ""bad guys"". Nevertheless, it compares favorably to some works by her Higgins namesake, despite the latter being a celebrity."
3,good story few flaws,"Well written story line characters a bit thin but was schocked to see St Martin's Press let a MAJOR flaw in story. Any Catholic that commits suicide it 'NOT allowed to be buried in consecrated gound much less have service with attending bishops, Shame Shame St Martins didn't you think Catholics would read it. Bad Taste, bad groundwork. sloppy editing. Maybe author ought to go with different publisher next time. She is to good for them."
2,Leave the writing to Mary Higgins Clark,This is probably one of the worst written books I have read...it started out going nowhere and ended up going nowhere...Not sure why I even bought it as I have read a couple of others by this author and basically felt the same way. Don't waste your money.
4,DID I MISS SOMETHING?,"The author writes well, but rarely have I read a book that left so many ""untied"" loose ends. There were many hints throughout the book as to who the bad guy/gal was, but most of these hints were never resolved one way or another. Unless I missed something? For example, what was the deal with ""the mole""? They mentioned it several times and then . . . nothing! And what about Pete Carlson? Did he spill the beans about Joy and Bill at the convention? Did he remain as anchor or did Yelena finally get rid of him? And what about the homeless guy stealing the animal doorknockers?? Can someone please tell me how that fit in with the rest of the book? Or did it? Were all of these simply ""red herrings,"" or did the whole plot just go right over my head? (I sincerely would like someone to explain this book to me - I'm not kidding.)"
1,Somewhat Disappointed,"Although there was software attached there was no Table of Content or no basic outline to follow in terms of putting the Business Plan together. I had problems with pulling it all together and found the book as well as the software not to be of assistance in that area whatsoever.I thought that the software would give you a laid out format to follow much easier than what I found that would assist me in the actual writing of this Business Plan and what I got was allot of sections with questions that I needed to cut and paste with no rime or reason that I needed to put together with no Table of Content on how it needed to be put together, in my opinion. Kind of like a gig saw puzzle. I wasn't counting on that! This book and software did not give me what I needed!"
3,Lord Grafton's Promise,"Yes, Lucinda is a fortune hunter, but not from greed, but as a simple survival method. However, her marriage to Sir Alaric may make survival a bit more difficult, even if she does die rich. From the first day of their wedded life, someone begins trying to kill Lucinda. In fact, they succeed in as much as they do manage to kill Alaric in a seeming carriage accident. Lord Grafton finds the wreckage soon afterward and realizes foul play has occurred, but suspects the bride, and so offers her protection, in the hope of keeping her close enough to trip Lucinda up and learn the truth. However, as it becomes plain someone wants her dead, Grafton begins to fall in love with this woman who is stronger than she herself ever imagined.If you enjoy a bit of mystery with your romance, then this will fulfill your needs. I'd go as far as to say that historical fans who normally shun Regency novels as light in substance might enjoy this as well.Amanda Killgore"
5,Great Ganster Flick,This is a great ganster movie that never seemed to get the credits in deserved. Most of the film takes place in a resturant owned by a quuiet Italian gentleman. His son is the chef. There seems to be a question about weather or not the owner should turn over his interests to some young upstarts moving into his territory. The final few minutes of the film leaves you with no questions.
4,Don't bother to relax !,"If you enjoy enjoy gangland and the world of food you will be well rewarded. A most, most enjoyable film!"
5,Excellent,This is one of my favorite movies. It was shipped fast and at a good price and in the original packaging.
5,Husband's Favorite,"This is one of my husband's favorite movies. It's a great ""tough guy"" story wirh great characters, and a cool surprise ending! Highly recommended."
1,Not Godfather,"It is surely notWaiting...orThe Godfather, it is a mix of drama, murdering(vendetta), sex-between-meal-making (so unhygienic) and so much characters that, as understood, even reviewers on this page did not get who-is-who similarly.Gomorrahdoes a business in NYC as nothing changed since the thirties of the last century.Why is it so boring, anyway?"
2,Three gangster families in one restaurant.,"This Italian family is really tough. After an old man, Enrico (Frank Bongiorno) takes a child to school, he is shot to death. It only brings Louis Cropa (Danny Aiello) up the godfather ranks. He owns a swanky Italian restaurant, but the head cook, Udo Cropa (Edoardo Ballerini), who is Cropa's son fires a young chef just because the knife he used on the chives wasn't sharp. Duncan (Kirk Acevedo) also works as a chef there. He tries to help Louis Cropa. One Italian gangster family comes into the restaurant. They are after Duncan and to buy the restaurant for bookmaking operations. In fact, every Italian gangster family is there tonight. Fitzgerald (Mark Margolis) and family is also there and boy are they pushy. It's a Tuesday night dinner rush and the pressure is on. it's kaos in the kitchen, but out front, things are about to boil.Ajay Naidu is the host, ""Ademir"". Sandra Bernhard is ""Jennifer."
2,Blade unit keeps breaking,The motor is powerful enough to make nut butter but the blade unit keeps breaking (the blades split off from the top release mechanism). The first time was under warrenty and the blade was replaced very quickly to my satisfaction but now the new one has broken and I have only had this unit about a year.
2,Fiction,"Most sons will only remember what a good man his father was. It is a pity any man has to go through life knowing that his father had no morals at all, and had so many people tortured and murdered. As sad as it is, this is one case where no amount of cleaning up behind his father can remove the blood. The author has no reason to even attempt this clean up, but he does. Would we want to read a book by a son of Hitler's that tells us that ""Dad was just misunderstood?"" Beria made Hitler look like an amateur. This son is not guilty of anything, other than writing this book. He should go through life with his head held up just as any other man. However, the book should never have been written. The only purpose of remembering Beria at all is to remember what pure evil, the devil and Hell is, and how the Russian people got there. At best, the book is fiction, and it made me angry at Sergo for writing it."
3,Super Hero Fan,This tape brings back memories. It's ok but the special effects and story lines are corny. As a kid growing up in the 1970's I didn't notice it. This is truly a poor female version of the 1960's Batman series. You have to be a true super hero fan to enjoy this one.
4,"Give us more power, Crimescope",Well - what can be said - we know its a silly show - but you have to admit they had guts filming it - of course I'm sure poor Dirdre is cringing when she's going to the video store now! LOL - but you definately knew that CSO was in - COlor Seperation Overlay - for those Electra-WOW special effects!Anyway - I think its still a little pricey for what it is - but it's a good run down memory lane regardless!
4,Just for Memories,The main reason I am got this VHS is for nostalgic reasons. I remember seeing it as a child way back then and it brings back memories of Saturday mornings. Electrawoman and Dyangirl are campy and cheesy but still fun. Also there was the added attraction of seeing two pretty girls running around in tights. So just looking back at that time and those feelings are reason enough to get this tape. I just hope it comes out on DVD with all the episodes. That will be a real trip down memory lane!
5,fantastic,"I have gotten everyone of my friends and family hooked on VnV and should hope that more people discover this amazing band. Thoughtfull and insitefull lyrics, addicitve synth programming, and an overall outstanding musical ability. IF empires and praise the fall weren't enough, we are treated to a 1st rate remix cd of empires. VnV doesn't just change around a few synth beats here and a few base lines there..they completely change the set moods of the songs and the result if wonderfull. From the energetic Legion(janus), to the trancy Radius, vnv shows their full musical abilities..and makes the fans hunger for more. Victory not Vengance!"
4,Grandious genius,"A very impressive release from VNV. I think the feeling they were going for on this album might be described as glorious. It seems to be a continuation of the religious themes hinted at with the Dark Angel EP. There's a feel of powerful Catholic symbolism in the songs, from the beautiful and powerful tones of ""lastlight"", through the hollow emptiness of ""legion"". I have yet to hear Empires, but Burning Empires stands on it's own as a beautiful and emotive peace of work. But this may not be for everyone. It's not as dance floor friendly as Praise the Fallen. Beautiful throughout, even during the desperation of ""further"" and the violence of ""kingdom (restoration), it's worth having."
3,Meh,This shoe is fine. The leather and interior is really soft but I am a little nervous that the bottom is going to wear down and end up getting holes in it. The leather is also so soft that I worry it will get really loose over time. Right now I love them but in the long run I do not know how happy I will be. Great price though!
2,Don't waste your money,"I own these shoes in red and am very disappointed. The leather is nice and soft, however it is so soft that the shoes give no support on the side and it looks like my feet are double their normal width. The sole does not cover the toe portion (as many other moccasins do) and now my bright red shoes have a huge white wear mark across the toe portion (imagine you were in ballet slippers up on toepoint-- that portion is completely worn). I must say- I own several pairs of mocassins but none were such terrible quality. I loved the way these looked that I ordered 5 pairs in various sides and colors and EVERYTHING went back."
3,Loved it as a kid...,"I saw this movie SEVERAL times (lost count) when it played at the local theater by my home when it came out.I was then, as I am now, a HUGE WWII buff, and the involvement of the B-29 alone made me excited for this film.The ranking Japanese officer's explaination of where he learned English (""Creve-rand"" aka ""Cleveland"") had me in stitches then as it does now.NOT out of disrespect for the Japanese, but out of understanding that ""some people in this world are different than we (Americans) are""!Hey, cheesy and ""family-friendly"" are what Disney does, with the exception of ""The Black Hole""; thankfully I was young enough to NOT know how dark THAT movie really was at the time of its release! Loved it all the same, had the action figure of Maximillian the robot..."
3,"Good, but not great","The Last Flight of Noah's Ark is about two strangers, two young children,and animals on a plane that crashes. They all end up on a remote island. The movie is good for family fun, but is a little unrealistic and is very predictable. It is unrealistic in the shark scene because the shark was moving too slowly and the water was too shallow. Also, the storm scene did not show the damage that it should have shown. Noah's Ark was predictable by the ""boy - meets - girl - falls - in - love - and - marries"" scene. In addition, nothing really bad happens. The movie is good to show how families come together and work together. Great for a Saturday afternoon, or a classroom."
3,A change of pace for the 8th Doctor,"While not as dense and complicated as lots of the other Doctor Who books, this is an interesting mystery set in the late 19th century which begins with Compassion pulling off something that is quite strange and would not be something you'd expect a TARDIS to be able to do! Then she, along with the Doctor and Fitz, are forced to take refuge at Banquo Manor, posing as guests who are scheduled to arrive to witness a scientific demonstration. As the drama at Banquo Manor unfolds, things go from dark to horrific. The most interesting aspect of this story is that it is told from the viewpoints of two of the guests at Banquo, alternating between them from chapter to chapter. We see some events described twice, from two different points of view, and both are ultimately befuddled by the Doctor's involvement."
4,Praise the Lord!,This is not my forte in music but I can appreciate the praise and worshipvibe coming off of it. It's very devotional and inspiration. The thing Ireally don't like it how long it take for each song to get going.
5,One of Hillsong's best!,I can't say enough about this project. The songs are the best. The fast ones inspire great excitement in worship. The slow songs will inspire great reflection on how awesome our God is! This is a must for worship!
5,The young John McCormack.,"Selected for inclusion in this second John McCormack CD issued by Naxos are Irish songs he recorded between the years 1910 and 1921. Don't expect the John McCormack aged 25 in 1910 to have the interpretative skills evident in his later years, but the voice was already compelling in its unique nasal tenor quality, and recording processes of the time captured it well.The songs themselves are less distinguished. They met the demand for ditties that recalled a long lost homeland for a large population of USA immigrants. McCormack made a fortune by meeting this need, so that performing and recording them enabled him to give up the career in opera that he disliked.These Naxos transfers and remasterings make these very old recordings sound better than in any other incarnation I have ever heard while magically eliminating most of the surface hiss that formerly was so intrusive."
2,This product is no longer valid!,"Don't be misled - this circa 1993 product is a worthwhile review of science reasoning, but it doesn't cover the latest exams. Instead, see the 2004 version."
4,Great Practical Read,"I think this book has what many other relationship self-help books miss, the practical ""how-to"" of the advice. It is succinct, easy to read, and very practical. I have applied the advice already, and I am happy with the results!"
5,Checked me!,"I bought this book YEARS ago and Amazon just asked for a review. Well, I have to say this booked opened my eyes to things that I was looking at all incorrectly. I saw that I needed to work on myself before I could give of myself to anyone. I created a REASONABLE list as suggested in the book and out of the entire list I married a man that had all but ONE thing I wrote down (and that was that he spoke Spanish). I have been married to this wonderful man for over 9 yrs and we are super happy and our relationship is solid."
4,Beautiful and easy to use,"My old bathroom scale could change its answer by 5-10 pounds in a matter of seconds. The Taylor 7506 has no such issue. Once I step on, one of two things happens. Either I get an Err message or I get an accurate and consistent weight. The Err messages simply mean that it needs to be re-calibrated. As soon as I step off and back on, the accurate number will the appear. Once I have the accurate number, I can step on and off the scale and will always get the same number back. The reason the scale needs to be re-calibrated is because I store it on its side, not because of any design flaw."
5,Way Better at Half the Price,"I bought this in October 2010 and have used it daily since. It continues to register accurately without having to replace the single battery. Previously I owned a Frontgate at twice the price requiring 2 batteries that seemed to need changing monthly. It's lightweight but very sturdy, very stable when getting on and off. The just-right sized glass platform ""disappears"" on the bathroom floor, can hug the wall and doesn't detract from the bathroom's decor."
3,"Don't get mad, get even","I had read many of the negative reviews for this product, but since it was recommended by Consumer Reports, I ignored them and focused on the positive reviews. I was very happy with the product until it stopped working a few days over a year from purchase. Now the negative reviews made more sense.While researching for the purchase of another scale, I came across an article that said the Taylor scale had a life time warranty. I put the scale in a box, addressed it to the address on the bottom of the scale and sent if off with little hope. About three weeks later, (I had already forgotten about it) a package arrived from Taylor with a new (or maybe reconditioned) scale. While I wouldn't recommend this product, I would recommend the company for customer service --- thus the middle of the road rating.I now have 2 digital scales and like to choose the one with the lowest weight (they are about 4 tenth of a pound different)."
5,big step up,"When my old bathroom scale died, I decided to go modern...and got this stylish digital model. I like that it turns on automatically, no fumbling for an on/off switch. It really is doctor-office accurate (I compared what my new scale said to what the doc's showed) and easy to read. Plus, with my old scale, replacing the battery was a real pain. I'm hoping the Taylor product info is true, and that its included lithium battery will last a long, long time."
1,Inconsistent and Unreliable,"Whenever we weigh ourselves on this, my wife and I can fall anywhere in a 20 lb range. That is unacceptable. Unfortunately I waited a bit too long to finally return it and now I am stuck with it."
1,Glass Shattered,I had this scale for 10 days. I picked it up to move it to the center of the floor to weigh myself and the glass shattered. Be careful! If it shattered when I stood on it I would have required stitches.
4,easy-read scale,"This scale certainly seems to be very accurate. It is easily read, and the digital readout stays long enough to be noted. We like it."
2,Not accurate... varied results,"I had plenty of chances to use this scale from the last vacation since I was in an all-inclusive. And I wanted to see how much the heck do I eat when in a secured location w/o good walking opportunities. Initially, it seemed good. But I noticed throughout the week that the weights varied even when the variables didn't. I.e. I didn't eat or drink, or pooped or peed. :) Well, at least it got our luggage thru the airline with the silly 50lbs limit and 1 suitcase per person (how?? for a 2 week vacation??). But even when I weighed myself on the scale with the luggage held, it varied w/in 2 lbs with no changes to me or the luggage. I did multiple attempts to get a good average, which one wouldn't need to if the scale was somewhat precise. the floors were tiled so it's even or as even as it can be. Even switched between different tiles to be safe.Like others said, I'm really surprised this was consumer report's top scale. I wouldn't buy it after my experience."
2,so slow to calculate and not that acurate,It looks so pretty but the scale always shows number so slow and it is like 3-5 pounds heavier than the other one in the clinic and the one I had before.
1,Scale went on the fritz soon after purchase,"We had ordered this scale from another retailer last summer and it was stylish and to the best of our knowledge accurate. When my daughter went to college in September, I ordered what I believe is the same scale from Amazon and had it shipped directly to her. Last week I visited and learned that the weight the scale displays fluctuates wildly and my daughter had given up on it. Very disappointing!! This one may just have been a lemon - can't tell."
3,Worked fine until . . .,"The scale worked fine until it went haywire (wouldn't settle on a weight but bounced around). Tried to reset but that didn't work.Contacted Taylor and they sent out a new unit, free and no shipping.If it fails again, I will post and change review to no stars."
2,I don't like it,"I had an old scale that would correctly work on the carpet and tile: turn it on (battery operated), step on it and it weighed. this one has to be on tile, has to be reset to 00 before using."
4,cold at 1st,this scale works great. very accurate and compact to fit in my small bathroom.but its cold to step on 1st thing in the morning!wish there was a fix for that
2,Horrible scale!! + Horrid customer service,Taylor scales are the worst!!! I purchased this scale at first all was great except the fact the platform is tiny... within a few months the scale was reading me 10 pounds lower in weight then what i was!! Doctor confirmed this. I called customer service and they tried to help me reset it but it didn't work. I was then told i can send it in and they would send a replacement 6-8 weeks.. are you fricken serious?? Not only that but the shipping cost was on me to send it back... was gonna cost almost $20 to ship it back NOT worth it!! Taylor won't be getting my business ever again.
5,Edit - Replaced,Used around 1.5 years (monthly 3-4 times) - Scale gives wrong reading now!If I step on (after 0) it it shows ----## EDIT ## Contacted customer service & very happy with replacement.
2,Worked great - for only 6 months!,"Gave this a 2 because, although at first it worked great, it quit working after 6 months. Changed the battery, tried resetting, you name it. Worse, the exact same model is available at Walmart, cheaper of course and no shipping charges. Would also be easier to return. While it worked, it worked great for the most part. Important not to move it around a lot or it resets but otherwise fine. There are just too many other products out there that are more reliable. And the ""lifetime warranty"" - again you have to pay for postage to mail it to them for either repair/replace. Think twice on this one."
1,lousy scale,today in less than 5 minutes I was able to get this scale to give me readings in a 3.6 pound range. Don't buy it it is a piece of junk. The only reason I gave it one star is amazon won't let me give none.
1,inaccurate weighing and then an error message- all in first day!,"I wanted to like this scale so much. Nice design, mainly very good reviews, and despite the negative reviews of the fluctuating inaccurate weigh-ins, I took the chance and bought it. Unfortunately, I am one of the unlucky ones stuck with a scale that doesn't weigh accurately.Not only did it not correspond to my weight as it appeared on my current non-digital scale, but one minute I would weigh a certain # of lbs. and literally 3 minutes later weigh 8 lbs more! Then another few minutes later, 4 lbs less! The scale wildly fluctuates. Then I got the ""Err"" message on the screen, and immediately stepped off as the instructions say. However,the manual says only to get off the scale if it says ERR. But it doesn't say how to fix this or deal with this.So now I'm returning it and am really annoyed because I have to pay $6 for return shipping and the scale only cost $22! Trust your instincts and listen to the negative reviews- Don't risk it!"
3,"Gorgeous, but Not Very Accurate","I adore the look of this scale in my bathroom! It is beautiful. I don't mind leaving out for anyone to see. However...it is not extremely accurate. I have been very careful about standing in the exact same location on the scale each time I step on. Most days it will give me the same reading again and again. Other times I have tried weighing myself 3 times in a row, five minutes apart after letting it reset and it varied by several pounds each time. I have no idea why this is! After reading other reivews I have also been very careful about not moving the scale at all, and yet it still varies by several pounds.Normally I would not think the varying pounds would be a huge deal, however, I am currently pregnant and am attempting to monitor my weekly weight gain. With this scale, it's pretty much impossible! What a bummer."
1,Trash,"Simply doesn't work. There is some writing on the back of the scale body (get out your magnifying glass...) that indicates the scale needs to be made ready by stepping on it, ignoring the reading, and then stepping off if the scale has been moved. Otherwise, if it has remained on a hard surface without being moved, that step isn't necessary. In other words, it will give a bad reading unless it is ""reset"" under certain circumstances. Well, mine seems to be stuck in the bad reading mode. I'm going searching for a mechanical scale, you can have all of these digital ""improvements"". A great deal of it is is garbage, including my Taylor 7506."
1,Do not purchase this scale!!,"I purchased this scale after looking at the reviews from Consumer Reports. By the way Consumer Reports gave my old scale by Health-O-Meter a horrible rating, but I never had any problems with it. The only reason I purchased a new scale was because my daughter took my old scale with her when she left for college. The Taylor 7506 would never give my an accurate reading. I would step off the scale and wait about five minutes before weighing myself again, and I would get a different weight. I have never gotten the same weight twice. Needless to say, I threw the scale in the garbage, and purchased another Health-O-Meter.What a waste of money!!"
2,Inconsistent Readings,I had a similar Taylor scale for several years and was very happy with it. I replaced it because it wouldn't work even after trying a new battery but it had what I considered a reliable and useful life up until then. I bought this Taylor scale in September and it has been very sporadic with its readings. I always take two readings to double check my weight. Sometimes I can stand on this scale three times and get three different readings. Some days the same reading will show twice as it should. This time I got a lemon.
2,Bad battery,"When the Taylor scale arrived, the battery was already not not working :( Very disappointing. However, it did arrive quickly."
4,"It's ""arthritic""","The first time I weigh myself in the morning it is 1 lb less than accurate. I know this because the next few times I weigh myself - within 30 seconds of the first time - my weight is the same but 1 lb more than the first time. But it does this consistently - every day- so I decided to keep it - after all, I have my idiosyncrasies too. LOL"
5,Does what it is meant to do,"Very cheap, looks modern, and fits well in my bathroom.I had to stand on it once when I first set it down to get it synchronized, and now all I have to do is just step on it.It feels very solid and durable, then numbers read very clear and large.I am very satisfied that I bought this."
2,"looks great, BUT WAS DEFECTIVE!","This product looked great and appeared sturdy with a wide base. I liked the clear glass in that it didn't make my small bathroom look even smaller. However, upon opening the package and following the instructions I was sad to realize that it didn't work. I knew the battery wasn't the problem. It just didn't give any weight readings. Screen was blank! Beware. When I contacted the manufacturer through their website, I got no reply."
5,Great scale,"We really like this scale--it looks nice and works well. The only drawback is that the feet are set in from the edges and every so often we accidentally step on the edge of the glass, which then in turn launches the other edge of the scale up in the air and the whole thing bangs down on the bathroom floor. We recommend it though. I think we have replaced the battery in it once in the 1 year and 10 months we've owned it."
5,My Bathroom Scales,The scales were received promptly. The Taylor scales are accurate and consistent when I weigh myself. Also the scales are attractive decor for any bathroom.
5,Nice Scale!,Easy to use and great accuracy! Super deal! i already shared this with several friends and I paln to recommend.
4,pretty good scale,i liked it because of the price and also it sleek design. the only thing i do not like about this is the battery compartment and the kind of battery it uses.
3,Disappointed,"Weight is not dependable. At first I thought, OK from one day to the other weight can fluctuate - I want to see the trend. Today, I weight 5 pounds more than yesterday and that seems a bit much, especially considering what I was (or was not eating). Some small variation I can take, but really 5 pounds.The scale is left against a wall and I pull it out about 6 inches to weight myself. It's not perfectly in the same spot, but it is within a few inches every day. It seems to have a memory so if you weigh yourself again soon it jumps to the same weight. I have weighed again maybe a half hour or so later and seen differences, but 5 pounds. I'm wondering if it's too late to return and will check.Good luck.Tom"
1,Piece of JUNK!,"I purchased this scale after reading numerous reviews via Amazon and Consumer Reports. Little did I know, this scale turned out to be a piece of JUNK. I purchased this scale in August (it is now currently January). For the time that it did work, it worked perfectly fine. As with all electrical items, the scale needed a new battery. After replacing the old battery with a new one, it still does not function. The digital display blinks all sorts of crazy numbers from weight being 0 to 854, etc. Needless to say, this is now useless. After browsing other negative reviews, I've decided not to waste any more time on this piece of junk (as futher action gained no results for others.) My bottom line? Do not buy."
1,Not Useful,"A scale needs to do just one thing, right?This often gives wildly exaggerated results at first, then you have to step off and let it re-set like a computer. Results can vary within a very few minutes.Display gave out after 2 years."
1,WHAT do I weigh???,"I purchased this scale after checking Consumer Reports and Amazon reviews. I must have ended up with a real lemon! I can weight myself 6 times in a row, and every time the scale gives me a different weight, varying up to 4 pounds. I'm on an aggressive weight loss program, and it's important to have a reliable home scale; this isn't it. I never know where I stand on any given day. It's going back."
5,Great scale!,This is a fabulous scale! It gives accurate weight down to a tenth of a pound. We almost bought a Weight Watchers scale but the reviews on Amazon were so bad we decided to check Consumer Reports. They rated the Taylor 7506 as excellent (#1) and it was half the price of Weight Watchers. We are so happy we did. We love it!!
4,Works great,"The scale works great: reliable, accurate, attractive. It does need a stable surface to work. Our older digital scale would work on carpet but this one doesn't."
1,Attractive time waster,"I don't know how Taylor performs quality control, but what was delivered to me was an attractive, but unreliable piece of junk. I weight less than 240 lbs, but this scale variously reported my weight as in excess of 1100 lbs, or simple reported ""ERR,"" a situation the instruction sheet says is due to weighing someone above the scale's 400-lb limit. I am returning it and will not accept a replacement."
1,Very disappointed,"Scale usually read about 3.5 pounds too high and once it read about 4.5 pounds too high. To confirm the high readings, I placed a 10-pound weight on it a number of times and each time it read 13.5 pounds. I returned the scale for a refund."
1,Not accurate,"I don't recommend this product and would send it back if I could. This scale shows my weight four pounds higher than my doctor's scale. I didn't think much about that but then I signed up with Jenny Craig and found the reading on their scale exactly matched my doctor's scale. Several weeks of Jenny's food and long, long walks went by, I lost four pounds according to the Jenny Craig scale, but the change did not register on the Taylor. Kind of a bummer because I bought the Taylor to replace another digital scale, a Tinita which turns out to be dead accurate after all. It's the first time a Consumer's Reports recommend ""buy"" has lead me astray"
1,JUNK!,"This scale looks great, but in less than two years, with use only once a day, it began to give wildly erratic readings seconds apart. By wildly erratic I mean fluctuating from in the 140's to the 170's. Now I must buy a new one."
1,Scale Broke After 3 Days,"I purchased this scale and it worked well for 3 days. After that, it gave me errors or drastically incorrect weights. Very disappointed with the product. Customer service did offer to send me a new scale if I send the old one back, but its not worth the hassle."
1,Not accurate,"I can weigh myself on this scale in the morning and go back 20 minutes later, not having eaten anything or changed clothes, and I'll be a half a pound heavier. I bought a digital scale with the ounces so I could track my weight day to day but this scale simply isn't accurate enough for that."
3,7506 Variant,"We bought the 7506 from a local store before, but this one is a variant design.The side silver frame are not straight compare to this image and can hold up to 400 lbs.I personnel like original one better with straight silver frame and seems to have better scale accuracy."
3,Taylor 7506 is OK..could have been better if,"We bought this scale to replace the one we've been using (health-o-meter) for at least 10 years. First, we got another health-o-meter scale but we have to return it.We like the look and the weight measurements that show upto 3 decimal points on this scale. We found that we weigh at least 3 lbs extra on this scale compared to the one we replaced. We believe that our present weight reading is more accurate.Since we keep the scale in our bedroom, i have one thing I don't like with the scale..it's the color black ink for weight display. I have to turn on the light to be able to read my weight. The first thing i like to do after i get up in the morning is weigh myself. I don't do it if my husband is still asleep and/or when the blinds were down.Next time, we buy another scale, the display of the weight will be in RED."
5,Great scale for an excellent price,"I've had my scale for a little over a month. The price was great, it arrived promptly, and I didn't have to pay shipping. It looks great, with a solid slab of glass and stainless weighing unit. It works even better and has none of the inconsistency my last scales had. I'm very satisfied with this purchase."
4,Keep it level,"This scale is attractive and accurate as long as it is on a level surface. The bathroom floor in my old downtown apartment is not exactly level, so finding the right spot to place the scale took a few tries. The large display is easy to read and turns off automatically, saving on battery life. Overall, I am pleased with my purchase."
5,More than I expected,step on once is all it takes to get an accurate read. Works well and every time used. I would recommend this to anyone and everyone.
2,Good while it lasted,"This is nice looking scale, but after about 5 months it just stopped working. It would only give an error message. I changed the batteries, but still got the same error message."
2,Stopped working at 15 months,"I maybe used this twice a week, had it for 15 weeks and it stopped working, replaced the battery and still nothing"
4,Taylor digital scale,Looks nice and seems to work well but I'm disappointed that they recommend you not store it propped up against the wall. You don't get that information until you've purchased it.
1,Horrible Product & Company,"I bought this scale from Target & paid about $40 for it, it was inconsistent from day one but I rolled with it basically figuring out my weight between the amounts it would give me each time I would weigh. I haven't had this scale but a few months & it broke. I am the only one in my house so I know no one has abused it to cause it's faulty-ness. When you touch it to turn it on it will zero then start jumping up & down with weight while no one or nothing is on it. Then it will give you either 3 little lines --- or give you an Err. It does this all the time. Tried replacing the batteries thinking that maybe it didn't have enough juice to work properly but that didn't help any. This scale is JUNK! Really angry I waisted my money & didn't read all the reviews."
3,Weighs about a half pound heavier,"I have three scales and the Taylor is very attractive but consistently weighs about a half pound higher then my other two scales. So either it is right and the other two wrong, or it just weighs heavy. My vote is the latter as I weigh at home and at the gym and Taylor, while very consistent, appears to be a little on the heavy side."
1,Dont waste your money,"Purchased this because i liked the look and when I received it was very happy. Very modern design. However if you are buying a scale to monitor weight loss/gain dont waste your time or money.....one day your 182, next day 194 next day 180....and these fluctuations can even happen in the same day, you step on the scae it will read one number, you step off and step back on again in an hour and there is a huge fluctutation from 182 to 192..10 lbs....never had a scale do this and it happens constantly, VERY unreliable and not worth the aggrevation"
1,Defective Item..,"After reading about 90% BAD reviews and 10% good ones, I STILL decided to buy this scale. Stupid me.The only thing that was fantastic about this purchase is that it arrived here in two days! Super fast. However as for the item itself... first of all the package seal was broken. So that was a good way to start.. Then this scale is crazy! It's all over the place. I literally stepped on it 5 separate times and each time it would give me something COMPLETELY different! I know I weigh around 145-150. So when I stepped on it for the first time and it gave me 120.5 I knew something was wrong. Stepped on it again, 152 (more believable). Stepped on it again, 135. Stepped on it again, 148.I'm returning this item as I'm writing this review. If I was you, I would chose a little bit more expensive scale so it can actually WORK."
1,Very frustrated with this product,"My mom and I both had a bad experience with this product. I received this product in the mail and it was working fine for about 5 months. In the 6th month, it stopped working all of a sudden. It was very random. I'm not sure what the problem was because I was using this product normally. There was no excess wear or tear. I was very frustrated with this product. My mom had a similar experience too."
1,Meh!,I purchased this Taylor scale because of the modern style. Its a nice looking scale but its not a good scale.This scale goes through batteries so fast. Doesn't accurately calculate weight.
1,Taylor Scale,"I don't know if I got a defective one , but this scale broke down after the 30th use. I never use it and its just stored. Now it doesnt work. Bought it in August 2011 and now its December 2011 and it doesnt work anymore. Not even 4 months for it to give out. Oh well. Time for another one. Definitely not a Taylor."
2,Taylor scale,I bought this because it was highly rated. The numbers are not consistent (varied by 3#lbs.)and it's hard to keep clean.
5,Great Scale,This is a good-looking sleek scale. It works really well. It is accurate and consistent. I bought it based on a Consumer Reports review. It's a great buy for the $
4,A Weighty Review,Received product promptly as described. Scale works nicely and accurately. Footprints do shoe on the glass....only a minor inconvenience. Easy to read.
3,It's okay.,"It's attractive, but I have a feeling that the scale is lying to me. On some days, it tells me that it hates me, I stink, and that I weigh a ton. Then five minutes later, it'd apologize, cry a bit, and tell me that I weigh as light as a feather.Seriously though, this thing is giving me whiplash with how much it fluctuates. I've tried the tips I've seen some commenters posted about and they don't work very well.At the same time, I don't want to give it a bad rating because it gives me a nice little number that I want to see...but I'm certainly certain that it's just lying to me. =/"
5,Very Accurate,"This scale is very accurate and if i stand on it then step off and step back on it shows the same weight both times. I use this everyday. it comes with batteries so you don't have to buy any. although this product works really well, do not use on carpet or the weight will be completely wrong( as goes for all scales). I think you should get this scale because it works very well and is an extremely good price. :)"
4,Excellent Scale,For most electronics and appliances I use Consumer Reports for advice.This item was highly recommended for a number of reasons and it was a no brainer to order it.
5,Great Accurate Scale for the Price,"It's a good looking, accurate and consistent scale at a great price.I personally don't care if it's a pound or two off from some other scale - who knows if the others are correct? Just because a scale is in a doctor's office or a gym does not mean they are accurate. Actually with the consistent heavy use, they are probably not as accurate as the Taylor.I would recommend this this scale. It's $30 - if you are really unhappy, throw it out and waste your money on something more expensive. Your pants not being tight is probably a better thing to keep an eye on than the scale anyway.06/08/11 - UpdateThis scale is still working great 1.5 years later with no issues and the same batteries!"
2,scale that needs pampering,"This scale doesn't give readings when it's cold. I have to warm it up with a spaceheater for it to work in the winter because I keep it in the laundry room. Is anyone else having this problem? Also, I find that it tells me I'm 3 pounds or so lighter than I am, which is very flattering, but it's just not true."
4,Taylor,"I feel that this scale is 3 pounds more than the actual weight, but at least the weight doesn't show 3 times differently if you step on it. So, if your weight shows 105lbs, you weight is actually 102lbs. Overall, the scale looks very nice and elegant."
5,Taylor 7506 Glass and Chrome Digital Scale,I purchased this scale for my 90 year old father. He is unstable and he was having trouble standing on his 50-year-old scale. I purchased the Taylor 7506 scale because it was a Consumer Reports Best Buy. The added plus is that it doesn't stand very high off of the floor and it has a nice wide footprint. Consumer Reports reported the accuracy as excellent. On multiple occasions I have weighed my dad at his house and minutes later at his doctors office with identical results. I strongly recommend the Taylor 7506 scale.
1,So inaccurate!,"After reading consumer reports I choose this model for its accuracy, according to there testing. I don't know who tested it but I either got a dud or they were ""blind"". It was 7-8 lbs. off in comparison to gym, physician, & another home scales. Nice looking but I returned it. I followed the directions for setting it up explicitly, leveling, stablizing, etc. I'll keep looking!"
1,Pretty but Useless,"I bought this scale based on all the great reviews it was getting. I failed to read the bad ones, and here I am writing one now. At first, I thought I was going nuts because it was showing that I had gained 5 lbs over one weekend. Everyone cheats in their diet- but not to cause a 5lb weight gain, especially when you are active. So I decided to check my weight daily - and again, it was a 2-5lb difference every day. This morning, I decided to get on and off several times and see if there's a difference. I went from losing 2 lbs, to gaining 5 lbs, to losing 4 lbs all in the matter of 5 minutes. The readings aren't accurate from one minute to the next, and I should trust it weekly? I will be finding a way to return this product, becuase it's useless."
1,Died after about 6 Months,"The scale worked for about 6 months and now it only generates jibberish on the digital read-out. Checked the battery with a meter and it is fine. It will be in the trash for the next garbage pickup. If I could, I would have rated it zero stars."
1,Scale can't make up it's mind,"The scale looks nice, but it's impossible to calibrate. I went to the dr and got weighed, used my roommate's scale and it said basically the same thing (within .5 lb), and then this scale said I was 10 lb more! Not to mention, if I place my feet differently, it can vary up to 8 or 9 lbs in the read out."
1,A scale needs to be accurate,"I bought this scale a couple of years ago and it has never worked as it is supposed to. Within six months the weight started to flucuate within one to five pounds. And this happens completely randomly. Sometimes I'll weigh myself, then step off the scale and back on and a completely different number will pop up! Isn't the whole point of having a scale that you can track your weight gain and loss confidently? Also the fat percentage thing never worked right from the start so don't fall for that at all."
2,Inconsistent,"Bought this scale based on Consumer Report reviews. Found scale to be inaccurate. Gives a different weight each time, varying by 2 or 3 pounds"
2,Robo scale,"It looks great, had great CR reviews.Every time I step on it I get a different weight.I could understand different weights morning to night, but i am talking minute to minute."
3,Taylor 7506 Scale,"Scale occasionally reads incorrect weight.Tippy. Often tips down as I get off the scale, so glass touches the floor"
3,Weigh varies daily,"While I love the look of this scale, it doesn't work perfectly. I know it is normal to fluctuate a little during the day, but three pounds or more is a little ridiculous (and just wrong)."
2,It does not work,This product did not work. Even when I got it to zero it was still two pounds off. I recommend the weight watcher scale. Two of my family members have it and they have lasted for years. I will be getting that one.
1,Close your eyes and point to a number,"So, I followed the instructions, weighed myself the first few times on this scale in the course of....5 minutes. My weight miraculously changed from 137 lbs to 152 lbs and all readings in between- on as flat, stable surface you can find. Accuracy to 0.2 lbs this scale says? I don't think so. Tried it on a different, flat, stable surface. 137 lbs to 148 lbs. Seriously?"
1,Stopped working,"These scales worked fine for a short while, now all I get is 0-Ld. I will try to get the manufacturer to assist."
5,Works Perfectly!,"We use this the day after she makes meatballs with the food processor, the all-clad pan, and meat thermometer. Works great!"
2,Taking 9 days from date of order to ship,"Hope it is worth the wait for it to ship. If not, I have wasted time trying to get another scale."
1,Hate it.,"I spent a lot of money on this and it COULD have at least been at least 10lbs off... but, no, it was more than 80lbs off.... CONSISTENTLY. One star, ONLY because it turned on without using any of MY batteries. NEVER EVER AGAIN!!"
3,Not as precise as it pretends to be,"There's a decimal place there, and the readings are in units of tenths of pounds (or kilograms), but that last digit is faked. The first time you step on it it thinks for a moment and gives you a reading. Step off and step on again and it will immediately give you the same reading. Step off and wait a few minutes before stepping on again and it will think for a moment and give you a different number that can be the better part of a pound away.If you pretend that tenths digit isn't there it's a perfectly decent scale, and I certainly don't imagine there are any better ones in this price range. I just object to giving them programming tricks to make people think the precision is greater than it really is."
1,This scale is crrrap and only worked about 3 times before dying,"I bought this scale only a week ago at Target and it worked about 3 times in a row right after I got it home. Then the next weekend I tried to use it again, and it just wheels through all kinds of values (none close to reality) and stops with dashes across it. I thought perhaps it was the battery had been on the shelf too long, so I bought some new batteries for it today (got some extras) but it worked exactly the same way with a new battery!Just like others, I got led to this scale from the glowing rating by Consumer Reports but they must make them in the cheapest factory in China, and I'm not impressed.I will likely return it for a full refund, and will look at other brands now. Good thing I kept my receipt and it failed in 1 week after purchase.Buyer beware!"
1,Pleased with my Taylor 7506 electronic scale,"It looks nice and is pretty accurate. I went for my annual physical and weighed on their balance scale; when I returned home I weighed on my new Taylor 7506 scale, which was 1.7 lighter. Close enough for me. I would recommend it to others."
5,#1 Rated Scale by Consumer Reports,"This scale has proven to be exceptional. It is easy to read, easy to clean, and comfortable to stand on. The readings are very accurate and consistent. It is a very good buy for a base digital scale."
4,Well worth the purchase so far,"I bought this scale based on reviews by Consumer Reports. I have not been disappointed. The unit is very accurate, reproduces the same results, and is ""stylish."" I'm glad I bought it."
4,Scales rating,"My wife and I really have enjoyed our new Taylor 7506 scales. They were rated as the most accurate (even over our previous high end model), and it appears that they are very accurate. They are easy to read (to the tenth of a pound even). They arevery nice looking and give the appears of taking up less floor space due to the see thru design."
3,Not that good,"Bought this scale because my family had joined weight watcher on line and needed to weigh in each week. It's very hard to get the scale to give you a reading. You must stand perfectly still, don't move a muscle or it will read error. Or get on it more than once with in a few minutes and it will give you a different number each time. Very frustrating. Would not buy again."
2,Not quite so precise,"After reading the reviews posted for this scale, I thought I should chime in and confirm what appears to be a defect:I just purchased this scale to upgrade from my current analog scale, also made by Taylor. I was immediately disappointed to find out that the readings I got from it were approximately 3 pounds heavier than the readings on my older scale. In addition, the readings I received fluctuated by as much as 2 pounds within minutes of each reading.I asked my wife to do a side-by-side comparison with the professional balance scale at the ER where she works as a nurse. She confirmed that this model also registered about 3 pounds heavier. I will be taking this one back for a refund.I gave it 2 stars because it really does look nice, unfortunately the performance just doesn't measure up."
1,junk,"I agree that the scale looks nice, but a pretty scale and $.41 will buy you a stamp. This piece of junk didn't last a month before it went blank. Replacement batteries didn't work. The reviews confirm that there's enough problems with this product to warrant spending your money elsewhere. Otherwise, you'll end up like me trying (but not succeeding) to salvage some self respect by writing a ""bad scale"" review."
3,Good for a home scale that is under $30,"I wanted a nice, economical scale to use in the bathroom as a general guide. For the price point, it does a good job. I am 2 pounds heaver on this scale than the professional quality at the gym. The good news is, it seems like it is a consistent 2 pounds. It's nice, pretty, and the numbers are readable."
2,"Inaccurate, Inconsistent, Disappointing","I bought this scale (my first electronic) for the purpose of more accurately monitoring my daily weight than with the dial scale I've been using. As a test, over the last few days I have stepped on the scale each morning three times in a 60 second period. The digital reading fluctuates one to two pounds within that 60 seconds. It also weighs 2 pounds heavier than the dial and other digital scales I've tested it against (calibration problem?). I bought two of these to give one as a gift. Now I'm sorry I did."
5,Taylor 7506 Glass and Chrome Digital Scale. from Amazon,A good looking scale and fit right in to our bathroom. Only problem found was the scale must be left flat on floor. I got some erroneous readings at first but after checking with the manufacturer I found out that moving it is not recommended. Other than that it works just great.
5,Scale tells the tale,"The Taylor 7506 scale looks good and sadly, is quite accurate. The glass deck makes it blend in quietly with the decor but doesn't disappear enough to be a tripping hazard. Inexpensive too."
3,Good enough for the price,"When i first stood up on the scale, it showed me a reading. Next time i stood on it, it showed another reading. It was a terrible disappointment at first. After a couple of misreadings, it showed a consistent weight. The most notable thing about this scale was it always had to be kept in a flat and hard surface to come to a consistent weight. If the surface was even a bit tilted the reading would get faltered. But altogether it is pretty good for the price, provided all the conditions are satisfied. These conditions are not hard to provide, so I would suggest you to go for this."
1,received used product,"just recently received the Taylor 7506 scale. The scale was apparently sold to someone else and was returned, the packaged was damaged and the scotch tape on the box had been removed and the plastic wrap around the scale had holes in it. I ordered this scale thinking I had purchased a new scale but received less. I blame Amazon for this practice of supplying used products to sold as new. I considered returning the scale but do not want to go through the trouble. my review will probably not be accepted."
3,out of stock,"When we ordered this item, it was out of stock and a different item was shipped in its place. We returned that item and asked for a refund."
2,Only fair,"The main reason I don't complete these reviews is because most do not require more than a few words, so, I just copy and paste this each time. Stars is enough."
1,Heavy weight LEMON,"Ordered this scale came super quick. Turned it on GREAT. Stepped on scale gave my weight. Next morn stepped on scale????? Its dead. Sent message to Amazon they said sending new one. Don't ever wory about return of bad one. Great Waiting on second one to arrive got email to retund bad one???? Had already tossed it as directed in email (save your emails) long time on phone got it cleared up.Got second one in three days opened turned it on Great. That eve stepped back on scale. DEAD!!! Put new battary in it worked fine . Next morn DEAD. message to Amazon, they said return. Returned . Days later ordered different brand 5 days shipping but dog gone it its worked for 4 days (straight) Now."
1,The product that does not work,"The scale looks great but, unfortunately it only worked one time. I replaced the battery but still does not work. Will come up with 0.0 lbs but then nothing."
3,Consumer Reports might need to test this one again,"Bought this make and model based on the very high CR rating. The scale worked for the first few weighings, and then went on the fritz. My husband, nephew and I experienced wild changes in our body weight readings -- from 100 lbs over, to many pounds under. When I called Taylor for customer support, they talked me through a seemingly voodoo-esque series of steps involving taking batteries out, resting the scale, putting them back in, resting, standing, turning off, etc. etc. We returned our first one and now have a second one in the hopes that we just got a lemon. We've had it for about a week and it's readings have been consistently accurate -- so that's encouraging. Only time will tell."
1,A scale that can't measure weight?!,"I'm finally getting rid of this piece of junk - it's been months of the display flashing up a wild range of numbers, running up and down across a 12-pound spread, before just giving up and going blank. There's never an actual weight measurement that settles out! I tried taking an average of the numbers that flashed up, but that's a ridiculous waste of time. The final straw? Setting it on flat ground, starting it up, and watching it weigh the empty air as anything between 0.0 - 6.8 pounds. Look elsewhere!"
1,Worked for 3 months,"It worked great for 3 months and then went completely bonkers. Showing gibberish and outlandishly incorrect weight readings. This change happened suddenly and has been irreversible, even with a new battery. I want a replacement but am not sure how to get one.Unless the company offers a money back guarantee or replacement guarantee, do not buy this item!"
3,inconsistent weight,"I was surprised after reading other reviews to find that this scale is just not consistent-- my weight magically can fluctuate within 5 lbs a day and I am nowhere near the weight limit for this scale. It has been frustrating... are decent, consistent scales just much more expensive? It does look good and is sturdy, just not reliable."
3,"Nice look, unreliable weighing",This arrived very quickly and looks as good as you think it might. But I can't get it to accurately weigh me. It changes 3-4 pounds either way every day. So I'm back to using how my pants fit to judge my weight. Maybe there is an adjustment that I can make?
1,Use a fortune cookie instead,"If you are looking for a scale to play guessing games with this is for you. If you need or want a scale that has any degree of accuracy or consistency you should skip this piece of junk. The reading I get are up to three pounds different within a one hour time span with nothing going in or out of my body in the mean time. This hasn't happened just once but enough to totally reduce the readings to a guessing game. I checked the scale against a 10 lb. barbell and it was 1/2 lb off... That's a 20% error(Yes, I checked the barbell against two other scales and it was 1 oz. over 10 lbs.So what's the use in even having it take up space. I've decided to start consulting Tarot cards, fortune cookies and mystics to tell me what my weight is. Those guesses will be just as reliable as this scale. It will make a very attractive base for artwork or a potted plant but as a scale??? Forget it!!!"
1,Crap,"Did not work out of the box. Yes, I removed the plastic strip beneath the lithium battery. I also installed a fresh lithium battery. Nothing. To be honest, I did not take the scale out of the box until just over a year after I received it. There was no sign of corrosion in the battery compartment. I am disappointed, but if there is a next time, I'll be sure to set it up right away."
5,Most useful scale.,This has been a helpful product. It has been easy to read. I like the fact that it is accurate and dependable.
5,Good product at a good price,"The scale is easy to read with large numerals, and is easy to operate. Automatically turns off. Pleasing to look at."
4,a nice scale but,the scale looks very nice and works very well. The only drawback I find is that in a darkened room there is no backlight on the numbers. You must turn on the room lights or use a flashlight to read how much you weigh. Even with the shortcoming I would purchase this scale again.
4,3rd time is the charm,"I bought this as a Christmas gift for my mother because I had bought one for myself earlier last year and love it. Her first one was dead on arrival. Amazon graciously sent a second one which was dead on arrival. Finally, I got through to Taylor and they sent a 3rd replacement. Mom is thrilled. It works and works beautifully. The numbers are very visible. It does not take up much space. It is very sleek."
4,looks good. does its job.,read the directions before stepping on to it....very modern and clean style.seems sensitive to any movement.arrived very quickly.
4,They don't get it: it's existential,"The other reviewers don't seem to realize that this book is an existential tale. It concerns a person's powerlessness to stop what is happening around them. See also ""The Incredible Shrinking Man"" for another existential story. The existential movement has pretty well died out (thank God!).As to the style of writing, I dare anyone to slam this book and praise Hemingway. They are very much alike.A good book, and similar to the movie (which used most of the dialog). Except for the movie making Carl ""the makeout king"", it ends the same way."
5,amazing,"I was glued to the page. This is an amazing and profound book. I think it is about how people can become desperate for love when they find that life is meaningless and have not yet found a purpose. Benjamin throws everything away--every convention, norm, close realtionship he has--for a chance at love. Ultimately this dude might be better off trying different rewarding activities and trying to make friends, rather than running away with a girl he hardly knows. Amazing characters--so real they seem to be fully alive. Pitch perfect dialogue. Very funny book full of honesty and true feelings. This is the way it really is people--take it from a recent graduate!"
2,The Movie is Better,"I read this book before watching the movie and its a little surprising that they made a classic movie out of this.Dont get me wrong,its not that terrible but its not good either.Charles Webb should have gotten the credit for the screenplay because it seems like the screenwriters just copied the book.And its hard to imagine not seeing the great sceneries and hearing the songs by Simon and Garfunkel and Dustin Hoffman's dilemma about what his surroundings is expecting him to be.The movie focused on how upper class existence can drive you insane,even though everything seems beneficial to you,you tend to look for more meaning (like in Five Easy Pieces).But you cant really get that feeling while reading the book.The characters in the book are more annoying and almost every conversations in this book doesnt go anywhere."
3,The book without the soundtrack?,"In most cases, the book shines, the movie is ok, and the soundtrack is forgettable. This title seems to defy gravity. The Simon & Garfunkle music is so powerful and haunting, it is seered into the collective memory of two generations. imagine the movie without the soundtrack, it's ok, but hardly iconic. Perhaps that the problem with the book."
3,Easy to read and entertaining,"This book isn't very long and very easy to read. The writing is clear and there are no deep symbolic storylines, just that of a college graduate trying to get some sense in his life. He's lucky, but also naive and has a very straightforward way of doing things. Really funny book, follows the movie mostly."
2,Pretty poor story with littel social criticisme,"Highly intelligent boy arrives at home after graduating perfectly at school, starts an affair with his father's partner's wife and later falls in love with their daughter. The daughter herself doesn't mind too much about being treated very badly as well as sexist and also excuses the affair the boy had with her mother rather quickly. Happy end after a crazy story.Little social criticism about the American way of live. This is a story about ""intelligent"" people who are unable to communicate on a normal basis with each other.An other step towards acceptation of affairs that can make life so painful. At least, this story shouldn't have a happy end!"
2,"""An Easy Reader""","We had to read the lessons in our English lessons. The teacher decided that we should read The Graduate"" by Charles Webb. The book The Graduate"" is easy to read and to understand. We didn't have a lot of difficultes while we were reading the text because the language used in this novel isn't too hard. The vocabulary is limited. That's what we were enjoying""! Our opinion is that the content isn't specially good. But there are books which are worse than The Graduate""."
1,A STUPID BOOK!,"fölsadkfkfökfk Did you understand that? Neither we did! As little as we understood the sense of this book! Who makes what with whom? Who loves who? What happens with Elaine? Who is going to marry who? How much Ben dies run away? Is that the solution? You see, question after question, no answer and no sense! Is that a book for intelligent readers? We don't think so. But it was a nice experience to read a book like this, it's something different. We don't recommend the book to you except you like reading books like this. It isn't a bad book but it isn't a book we'd like to read. again So we wish you much fun by reading this book!"
2,The Graduate - fails,"I'm not a fan of this book. Even knowing it was written by an individual who had recently graduate from college and it was supposed to be something fighting against the establishment does little to increase its standing in opinion. Reviewers of the time called it heartbreaking and hilarious. I would lean towards calling it hilarious - hilarious that a novel which is absolutely chauvinistic, misanthropic, lacks plot, character development or witty dialog, could have received this much recognition."
2,What the heck happened?,"Two stars, two stars... mulling it now, and looking at the song titles on the disc -- almost none of which brings up a memorable tune -- one star feels more appropriate.This is a very disappointing release. Sadly, it would be disappointing even if it hadn't followed the incredible Marbles. There's just nothing here. Last time I tried to listen to it, I don't think I got even halfway through. It was just stupefyingly dull. Even ""Faith,"" which we've enjoyed as a live acoustic piece for years, gets heavy sedation here and ends a low-note album on the band's lowest note yet.I'm very worried that the next album will be produced by Michael Hunter, too, whose own stuff is ambient and softly pretty but also so uninteresting as to be nearly unlistenable for me.Sad to say it, but for me this is the low point of Marillion's career. Wake up, guys!"
1,Horrible,"As a big Marillion fan it is sad to say that this is the most horrible record they've made so far. The first two songs are good to listen to but after those it just fades out.I don't know why the band is still labeled as a progressive rock band. This was once the case in the Fish era, but after H. took over the singing the band redused to a regular pop band.H. started prommising with ""season's end"" and the ""Brave"" album is still a great album. But lately they just seem to have lost the track and have been taken over by new prommising bands like ""Porcupine Tree"", ""Riverside"" and ""Opeth""."
1,Long time Marillion fan,Marillion enthusist usually come in two breathes. Before Fish and after fish....Personally the first 4 Marillion albums plodded along in the same 4/4 sequence in rhythm section and muscial interplay. I felt Marillions fan gave them a cold shoulder starting with Seasons End and their best album to date is Brave.....Unfortunatley Somewhere Else is a step down for this tying band. The group members seemed to write music to write music with out putting a lot of thought into creating music in a foward direction to build on. Sorry if I upset you.
2,"i agree, subpar",it's all been said above. how did this album get such a good average score when so many people are slamming it? heh.basic statements i totally agree with -- lame album from a band w/so much talent- they are still good live (smoke was a great album!)- tracks are too poppy and lack individuality. are these guys retiring?
2,Enough of the Hogarth whinning,"Their previous release, Marbles was great because Hogarth limited his whinning and the band express itself musically. Somewhere Else is a return to Hogarth's crying taking over the album. The music is flat and the sound is un-inspired. Get Marbles, it's a much better album"
2,Instantly Forgettable,"As usual, great performances from great musicians. I really do enjoy the Hogarth stuff though I very much prefer the Fish years. This is fine music like Marillion can always pump out in their sleep. The problem for me is that unlike good Marillion albums, this one simply has nothing special to offer. There is nothing to hold on to and relate back to this album. It is simply forgettable. Mind you, this is worlds better than 95% of the drivel that is being defecated into the music world by so-called musicians. Nevertheless, as far as Marillion goes, I would simply skip this one and put Misplaced Childhood back into your player."
2,A Bit Weak,"If you're reading this, that, most likely, makes you a Marillion fan. This band has always represented my iconoclast take on popular music. It's always (especially with this band) a personal choice. While, for me, every prior CD (with the possible exception of Season's End and Brave) had a few tracks worth skipping, I could rely on a clever lyric or tasteful twist to captivate me. Weak lyrically, too much of the material seems anxious to sell out in a desperate attempt to become relevant. Still a talented and largely ignored band, this disc will give the critics (who I love to hate) legitimate reasons to continue ignoring Marillion."
4,Kept ice for hours,"We left ice sitting in this bucket on the counter for six hours. We still had ice cubes! Well worth the price. I wish it came with tongs, however."
3,Water Sprout from Heaven,"This Polish water bucket isn't all that its cracked up to be considering each time I fill it up, I arrive at home with less than a 1/3 of the original water and I can't figure out why. I use this then mostly to cook a chicken inside a boiling pot of water and it works really well. It can also be used as a hat for mildly windy days in the Serbian countryside or as a loud drum to scare away dead birds."
1,Rusty scratches on a stainless steel!!!,"It could be an excellent bucket if not a rusty scratches all around the top edge of bucket. Yes, yes, rusty scratches the on a stainless steel!!!I'll take a photo and attach to this product shortly."
1,Not dishwasher safe & Rusts,"Original Post: Despite what is stated in the product description this item is not dishwasher safe. After the first wash water got inside the insulation wall that could not be removed.Sep 2 2011 Update: After receiving a replacement I decided to hand wash it. I dried it completely, however it still got rusty. Terrible product!"
5,Lenox Tuscany Classisc Stainless Steel Ice Bucket,Excellent product. Arrived super fast. Beautiful and elegant without the fuss. Can fit alot of ice. Perfect for any occasion and easy to store. Great value. Thanks!
5,Excellent Ice Bucket,"This is a beautiful ice bucket, which is priced reasonably. I've used it several times now, and can recommend it without hesitation."
3,"Decent Receiver, as long as you put it on the dash","I found that this radio is a decent buy, but it doesnt have a strong enough receiver to really do what you want it to do unless you mount it on the dash or even closer to the antenna. I have a subaru and a mazda, and the ""antenna-less"" cars like the new subarus are not x-act friendly. Personally, I suggest the Sirius One radio over this unit, as it packs more power and simplicity - for $25!Additionally, the remote on the xact receiver is all wacked out - makes it hard to juggle stations if you want to change while driving."
3,Not good for in-home use.,"For the most part, I agree with the other reviews; this is a nice little unit, it's solid and well built. It works well for the car, but be aware it has serious drawbacks for in-home use.There is no FM receiver in the device. Sirius retransmits their signal over standard terrestrial FM frequency in the larger cities so you can still listen indoors and under bridges and underpasses and such. This device cannot pick it up.There is no antenna-aiming screen. Most Sirius radios have the ability to show you graphically where the best signal is so you know where to place the antenna and at what angle. This device does not.None of this is mentioned on the box or in the documentation unfortunately. Unlike XM, the Sirius sattellites MOVE, which makes it tough to keep a good signal indoors without mounting the antenna the roof."
4,"Very helpful book, from the little of it I have read!","I cannot fairly rate this book, since I have read very little of it (have not had the time yet). From what I have read of it, I believe it will very helpful to us - to help our autistic son."
3,"Certainly a ""must-have""...","...If you like the genre. I agree that the vocalist does occasionally sound like Ozzy, but you could say that any heavy band whose singer has a high, nasal voice, resembles Sabbath. I personally don't like Ozzy's voice, but I enjoyed this album very much. I think these guys have plenty of potential, and this album is quite good. It will be interesting to hear some of their other stuff.Cheers!"
4,Real Catchy Song,Ben Harper is a Really Talented Guitarist who has a Really Catchy Groove here.this Song is Different from What Harper has put out in the Past.it's Real Catchy but good.check it out this Guy has paid his Dues.
4,"Great Beat, Great Melody","I always hear this song on the radio. I love the beat and melody, but the repetition of words could probably make you want to turn it off. The lyrics could have been worked on a bit more to make it an unbeatable song. But if you're a fan of just listening to the tunes, this is a great song for you."
1,No Lyrical Imagination,"This song is centered around a chorus that consists of one line repeated 4 times. At one point, he even sings it a capella for additional emphasis, as if having sung it 8 or 12 times before wasn't enough to drive the point home.The pseudo-jazz drum solo and scatting at the end do nothing to save the song from being unimaginative, mediocre and annoying. It was playing in a clothing store where I was shopping today and it almost made me walk out of the store.What annoys me is the thought of so many talented artists out there struggling, while an amateurish song like this gets airplay."
2,Uncomfortably dramatic,"I had considered reading this book after finding on this site an odd mix of older, mostly negative reviews, immediately followed by a cluster of positive comments. I have to say, despite my best intentions, I wasn't particularly moved by the end. I'm uncomfortable with the overly sentimental style Swallow throws out, particularly in relation to her personal problems. This is not material that lends to melodrama if children of divorce are meant to read and apply to their own lives. I fear all they will come away with is more than they needed to know about not divorce, but the author."
2,A Horrible marriage memoir is more like it....,"I can't believe I had 25 pages to go before her 4 year separation was finally over! I finished it just so I knew she did get divorced. I wish I had put it down after the first chapter like I wanted to do. She went into 200 pages of detail on her marriage before she talked about what this was supposed to describe.I was hoping to read a memoir about what someone goes through while separated/almost divorced, and all I read was a poor me story on what her marriage was like. I can read that in a magazine and don't have to waste as much time.If you want a good book on what you could go through, don't read this, but if you want to hear a story on what a bad marrige can be like, perfect!"
1,DON'T READ WHILE EATING!,"I only got through half of this book before the overwhelming desire to escape from the rampant self-pity consumed me. Believe it or not, Ms. Swallow is quick to point out how she had been mistreated and how she suffered, and it appears she had little to no fault in the ""breaking apart"" of her marriage. Why do I think her ex-husband and the poor children who will one day read this self-important nonsense might disagree? If Ms. Swallow is indeed such an acclaimed journalist, she should know the art of being objective by now. Maybe her ex-husband will use it if he decides to defend himself and come out with his own version of the truth, maybe one that will be a little easier to digest."
1,Please validate my feelings,"While I could see this book becoming a respectable late night Lifetime movie, I would hardly call it a must read. The book chronicles (in agonizing detail) the authors separation and subsequent divorce. The thinly veiled attempt at helping others through this difficult process is frequently overshadowed by seemingly unending pleas for sympathy and desperate attempts for the validation of her feelings.If you are going through a similar situation, I would avoid this book at all costs. Upon finishing this book, you may, as the author did, have a completely distorted perception of your life and the rest of the world. On the other hand, if you would like to wallow in the misery of a failed relationship and convince yourself that a worse fate cannot befall you, order this book immediately."
2,I have a moral problem with this book,"John Irving wrote a short story called ""Almost in Iowa"", which appears in the ""Trying to Save Piggy Sneed"" compilation. On his notes about this story, Irving says: ""I feel most strongly that writers who have children, and who have been divorced, should not write about their divorces; to do so is a form of child abuse"".My feelings entirely.Wendy Swallow rehashes painful moments of her marriage for the world (and her children) to commiserate with her. This book is slightly exhibitionistic and downright exculpatory, but more than anything, it is personal, and she is robbing her children from something very precious."
4,Honesty and Clarity,"The honesty in Wendy Swallow's memior of divorce is what defines this book. Told by a 37 year old professional and mother, in the clinches of divorce, by personal choice, the memior puts into words the pain, guilt and freedom inherent in redefining oneself after leaving a marriage. It is not a journey through a custody battle, but a journey through the psyche of a women and the emotional obstacles she faces as she searches for the person she wants to be."
1,"boring, slow, vapid - glad i got it from the library","i read a review of this book on amazon.com that was very favorable - did we read the same book? i almost wonder if i should rate this book at all, considering that i only got through about 75 pages. usually i'll force myself to finish any book, but this was such a waste of time that i returned it immediately. good for my pocketbook, since it's the first book i've actually returned on time to the library in years! thanks wendy. better luck next time."
3,mas o menos,Todo llego bien. El equipo funciona bien. No trae detalles es nuevo. Pero vino con el cargador dañado. Y pense q el equipo traía mas accesorios. No trajo cable usb ni cd. Pero por el precio esta bien.
2,Dead on Arrival,"I'd read all the reviews which were, for the most part, positive. The phone arrived on time from the shipper. I loaded the SIM, but then every time I opened the slider and pressed with any pressure at all, the phone would short out and turn off. Don't know if this problem is specific to my phone, but the slider concept appears inherently risky given the moving parts. Too bad, I wanted a quad-band phone to use internationally, but this won't be the one - I've gone ahead and ordered a Samsung 'candy bar' phone."
3,not new,Only now looking at the images did I see that this phone was used and owned by someone with t-mobile. I thought it was new. Maybe i missed that information when I first ordered the phone. Having some difficulty getting rid of the t-mobile icons and ring.
2,Front buttons are not secured.,"Myself and two co-workers had this device, back in 2007. For all three of us, the middle button fell off through normal use. For my co-worker who used the device more than me, the ring of buttons around the centre button also fell off. The buttons being glued on is not cool.Other than that, it functioned fine. Nothing spectacular about it, but it was good for what it was."
1,Garbage,"This was branded as a T-mobile, and although it worked with an AT&T SIM card, it created this problem where it thought I was a T-mobile customer and would send a text every two minutes. Returned. Total crap, do not buy. The phone itself sucks too. The keyboard is awkward and the screen sucks. I'd rate it a 0 if I could."
3,experience with DB Roth/Motorola product,"DB roth is good at response. When they found out the charger come with Moto Z3 has defect they sent me a partial refund on that charger real soon. The product were actually made in China, both phone set and charger, even they are Motorola. The quality is not that good any more. I'm very disappointed."
2,Unoriginal mumbler,"People don't even know how bad this is because they have not seen GOOD magic.The real magic at work here is the hype and the publicity machine. Really, if David Blaine can be considered a great magician, then anyone can... He mumbles in a dead pan droll manner thru all his performances like a first year magic student that has no character or script.The success of David Blaine just goes to show how magic is a great art that is rarely seen."
1,David Blaine - is bad for magic,"I am a upcoming magican and I feel David lets down the whole team. His street magic he approaches people full on and most of the time frightens them. Yes his card tricks are very good, but the rest is nothing new. Now people like Darren Brown, engligh guy, are whats making magic more open to new people. Also the whole bit about not using camera tricks and then using them for the levelatation bit I felt let himself down greatly. It was a simple parlour trick any ten year old could do, I been doing it for almost a year now. I look forward to the guy doing some new stuff and making magic open to the general public agian...."
1,OH look mummy there a man flying,"Being a new and upcoming magican I am really disappointed with the DVD, anyone can do magic with the use of cameras, I wonder if David Blaine will ever do a large scale stage act. Yes I like his card tricks and there are some original tricks there. But when it came to the guy leveltating, I laughed myself silly it is so obvious how it is done. .........I am sorry Charles to share this with you, but it was terrible. That one act made me question the restof his work and how much trick camera work he used there. I am sorry but I will not be buying/watching anything to do with Blaine from now on, I suggest people save there money and buy another magic DVD"
5,GREAT ENTERTAINMENT!!!,"David Blaine - ""Fearless"" is a must have for anyone who has the slightest interest in Magic. His magic is up close and this DVD clearly shows himself as one of the worlds greatest magicians. There is plenty of footage and nonstop action. Each trick will leave you shaking your head in amazement. His tricks will never get old and this DVD will make an outstanding addition to anybody's DVD collection to watch over and over again.For the true David Blaine fans I recommend purchasing his book ""Mysterious Stranger"" along with this video. In the book he reveals how hid did a couple, not all, of the tricks on this DVD. It also reveals how he got into magic and how he begame the man he is today."
4,Very entertaining...,I have to admit that I had never heard of David Blaine before. My husband wanted this for a birthday present so I bought it for him. I watched this show with him and was surprised that I liked it as much as I did being the sceptic that I am. David did some pretty awesome tricks and we are still trying to figure out how some of them could have been done. Some tricks seemed a little hokey but it was still very entertaining. I think this show would be suitable for the whole family as well. I am looking forward to another show to be released soon on DVD so I can buy it. Enjoy!
5,THE GREATEST MAGIC TRICKS EVER!!!!!,"When I first seen heard about this movie I thought, oh okay another one of those cheap magic movies again. But when I seen it I couldn't get my jaw off the floor! I was all in awww! Nothing but amazement in this movie. I've seen it over 20 times! You gotta watch it! Now, I'm just in LOVE with DAVID BLAINE!!!"
5,Do you believe in magic?,"David Blaine is extremely watchable and will completely blow your mind with the magic he performs. Despite doing a lot of card tricks (probably some of the best you will ever see mind you) the variety of tricks he performs will truely amaze you.I'm sure he could start religions after some of his performances - the people are so engaged. It's interesting to note that some people believe that he is spiritually gifted, or some kind of guru. Although he will leave you doubting the laws of science, he is still mortal and just an illusionist, albeit also one of the best in the world. Due to his street performances he can't use any fancy props, which makes you wonder even more how he is able to achieve such amazing effects. If you knew however, it wouldn't be hardly as entertainin.If you love magic (and let's face it, who doesn't?) you certainly won't be disappointed if you buy this DVD and I guarantee you will want to show all your friends."
4,Great close-up magic,"A great DVD, David Blaine is a great close-up magician,do not believe the people who tell you that Blaine is fake, because he isn't, offcourse he doesn't work alone, just simply because if he would, some things he does (card through window) would be impossible.to rectify a kid's review earlier,David Copperfield isn't a magician, he is an illusionist, completely different thing, also, Copperfield is a worlwide know phenomenon, way more famous then Blaine, and lastly, it's foolish to even think Copperfield creates his own magic, he has a team of well-paid people who create illusions FOR him.great DVD, but i justed wanted to rectify."
1,Absolutely Tedious!,"David Blaine's overrated presentation is not only tedious and frustrating to look at but it's trite. David Blaine absolutely does nothing original, exciting, or entertaining. The majority of his dull presentations are filmed in the low-income Ghetto of an inner city. He shows various racial and ethnic minorities a multitude of trite card tricks for most of the DVD. Even at the end of the presentation when he traps himself into a giant ice-cube left me bored and irritated. There was absolutely nothing interesting, entertaining, or unique in this film.I've watched David Copperfield's DVD entitled Illusion which was profoundly impressive. David Copperfield does exciting and professional illusions and magic that feature elaborate presentations inside lavish theaters and outdoors, too. David Copperfield sets the standard and unfortunately David Blaine falls flat. David Blaine can't even compete with the pretentious Criss Angel.I give this DVD an F-."
1,It is called a writing class and the author missed it.,"I was very excited to read this book and I was highly disappointed. The content was great but the editor and author needs to be slapped. The layout was ridiculously confusing, the chapters had no flow, pictures didn't correspond with the stories, some of the interviews bordered on the foolish, etc.... The was a two paragraph mention about black male models. what about children models? What about the effects of we are portrayed in advertisements through history? Where is the history? A chronological timeline? I've read articles in white mags about black models that gave more information that this book. Don't buy it."
5,Ridiculous and Wonderful,"The production on this album is ridiculous, and it's wonderful. It may be the best cheezy album ever--the songwriting is great, and in a day before digital recording, it was made (or overmade) with an incredible amount of care. Stephen Chrumbacher's voice is unusual but fits his writing perfectly. The rest of the playing and singing is simply perfect--maybe too perfect? The first time I ever heard this on tape (a kid in my youth group had left it lying around), I knew I shouldn't like it but I just couldn't help myself. I was as happy to have this album make the jump to mp3 a few years ago as any other. Bottom line, you won't want your friends to know you listen to it, but you'll love it. And then you'll find yourself looking at World's Away--and you'll make sure nobody's looking when you buy it, too. Bubble gum rock n' roll at its absolute finest."
1,You can't call it Ceramic when the coating comes off.,"I was so psyched to buy this straightener, and I loved it for like 2 weeks. Then I noticed that the ceramic coating on was starting to come off. Less than two months later, my straightener has huge exposed sections of metal. Worse yet, the manufacturer (Helen of Troy) will only exchange it for a new one-- which will take at least 3 weeks and simply give me yet another faulty product. I have a smaller product from the same manufacturer and it's also doing the same thing -- I'd highly recommend against this product."
1,Dont buy,with in the first 4 days and only 3 uses my bottom plate was already flaking ...it catches your hair and the only to get it out is to pull which does hurt ....it works ok the first couple of times but i find i am scared to put it on a high temp cuz i dont want it to flake so if you have 30$ and you want this product keep saving and get a better one ....this product is not worth your time
3,ok,well overall this was an ok product but it didnt keep my hair straight for a long time. also it recently broke(the top iron stopped heating up)i would say it is worth the money if u have ruly hair
2,FRIZZ!!! FRIZZ and more FRIZZ,This product hurts and ripps out your hair when you use it. It also leaves ur hair smelling burn't and smokey. When you go out and it is humid ur hair will go back to its normal self and get very frizzy. The only good thing is that it does not break easily.
5,Four Years and Still Kickin'-Amazing!,"I have had this straightener for about 4 years and honestly, it is the best straightener I have ever used. I have tried various other types that leave my hair frizzy (Conair.. cough, cough) and well this an has been great to me, I have to say. At the nice price of $29.99, I definitely got my money's worth. Now, 4 years later, I am finally considering purchasing a new one, just because after 4 years of daily use, it is finally getting alittle old.. though it is still running like a champ. I would HIGHLY recommend this product."
1,Terrible,"I am a macromedia developer of 4 years as well as a Java developer of 2 years. I read the book cover to cover and went back to through it again before taking the Macromedia Certified Developer Test. I also went through all of the questions in the book and scored myself, making a 92% the first time and a 100% on the second 2 days later.I went and took the exam to find that the book covered around 15 - 20% of what was actually on the test. While the book does a good job at providing an overview of Flash MX it is hardly a study guide...only a few concepts helped me with the test."
2,"Good training, however inappropriate study guide.","I recently took my Developer test and failed. :( I have been designing and programming in Flash for close to 2 years now, and while I found this book to be a great source for overall A.S. training, it really didn't prep me for the exam. There was very little in the book that actually reflected the level or detail the exam demanded. Understanding Macromedia has since changed the exam after this book was published, I still wish there was a way the publishers of this book could offer provide its owners some materials on the updated exam and its new expectations."
3,"Good, but not good enough!","Although I did learn some new terminology and have a more thorough understanding of ActionScript (1.0), this book did not adequately prepare me for the Certification exam. I do recommend that someone buy this book, in addition to some ActionScripting ""How To"" book that gets you submerged in programming AS and using the debugger tool A LOT MORE!"
2,Could have been better,"First of all, this book was created because Macromedia Flash certification is getting more respect and the desire to obtain certification is growing. Because of the lack of example exams and general knowledge on what to expect people are hungry for a good study guide.This is not a good study guide. It covers the easy topics with great detail. It talks about things that don't show up on the exam (i.e. good coding style). It skips over more difficult topics and suggests that the reader find a good reference.I recommend that you read Colin Moock's reference, then if you want a good study guide download the test outline from Macromedia and buy the condensed pocket reference to Mr. Moock's book.Study, and practice and you're sure to pass. Just don't expect much from this book."
3,"Good, but not enough",Buyer beware: this book is a good overview of the topics you need to know. But your time would be well spent with Colin Moock's book as well. In addition the practice test on the books related web site is nowhere near as difficult as the real thing.There are some very good code samples in this book that will benefit even the most seasoned Flash MX developer. They are woth the purchase alone.
5,Concise and complete,This is a valuable book for all. The the review of sections I am familiar with it was well written and distilled the concepts and key points to just what I needed. I give it a rave review because it helped me to finally get concepts that was previously struggling with. It is not an encyclopedic reference nor does it pretend to be. It covers just what I needed without distractions or extraneous fluff.Well worth every page!
5,Great looking counter stool,"I purchased 2 for my kitchen island, and they look great. One of the stools that I have received at first had a crooked screw hole, but Amazon replaced it immediately after I submitted the request, and the replacement item didn't have this problem. The stools are easy to put together, very sturdy, and look great, especially for the price."
1,You spelled PittsburgH wrong.....,It's not Pittsburg..... There is an H on the end of the city name. It's PittsburgH.
3,One of Goldsmith's weakest.....,"I have read all of Olivia Goldsmith's books, and I found this one to be among the worst. It seems like she wrote it in a matter of days- if she wrote it at all! It's silly, predictable, and the characters aren't much fun at all. They lack the depth and lovable flaws that attract us to her characters in most of her books. And while novels aren't supposed to be realistic, this one is so far-fetched it is irritating. ""Bad Boy"" was unlike many of her books because it did not have a large ensemble cast like ""Billy,"" but at least that was funny and a decent read. This seems like it was written to appeal to teen girls.Missing from this book are Goldsmith's sharp wit, great character development and fun plot twists. It's a good thing that this author will be remembered for her works like ""The First Wives' Club"" and ""Flavor of the Month"" and not for poor efforts such as this. If you're new to Olivia, leave this one on the shelf and pick up ANY of the others she wrote."
4,Like but not love....,"I can't say I LOVED this book, but it wasn't as bad as some reviewers claimed it to be. All of the Brooklyn girls worked on my nerves a bit, but i did enjoy Kate and Billy and Elliot and Brice."
1,What a waste of time and money :(,"I COULD NOT finish this book...Kate, the heroine, is a terrible stuck up snooty cow, who doesn't deserve friends, and started irritating me almost right away. The story is weak, the hero is also not very likeable and basically, I had to put the book down unfinished and just face the fact, that this is complete rubbish and a waste of my money... My advice to you? DO NOT buy this book!"
2,Dull,This book is certainly not one of Ms. Goldsmith's best. I found it to be very predictable and unimaginative. There weren't even any good love scenes to add spice. I found the characters to be annoying and under developed. The ending also came too quickly. Not enough relationship development between any of the characters. Pass this one up or at the very least borrow it from the library like I did instead of paying for it.
1,"Even with 1-star, this is an overrating","This must be the worst trimmer I have ever owned in my life.Besides being a good item to release some steam by slamming this piece of junk against my sidewalk, everything about this trimmer is bad:1) almost next to impossible to start the engine2) next to impossible to keep in going for longer than few minutes3) next to impossible to control the throttle4) shaft not long enough for any comfortable hand positioningSave your money, stay away from this, and probably any other Homelite product. It will make your wallet light but not the work."
1,A poor version of a great movie,"As an earlier reviewer has observed this film needs to be seen letterboxed. Despite saying 'letterboxed' on the DVD box, this version (from Patherfinder Home Entertainment) could not be viewed by my standard DVD player in letterbox form."
4,Louise Brooks -- a retrospective look,"Basic information on the life of a fascinating personality. But what should have been intriguing was cookie cutter sterile: birth-life-death-rediscovered. However, the interviews with an old Louise Brooks were riveting but way too short and the anecdotes from her niece were an interesting look at her personality from the perspective of her family."
3,Really good,This is a grate movie. I dont really know what alse to say exept that this is a must see.
4,"If you want to buy this, wait!!!","four and a half stars, actually.Don't buy this DVD seperate--this documentary comes as an extra in the recent Criterion issue of ""Pandora's Box""--an incredible issue of an incredible film.I loved this documentary when I first saw it but then I read Barry Paris' biography--who also wrote this documentary. That book is an incredible and deeply moving experience; I don't recall being so moved by a biography before. That book shows how this film is way too brief--and just begins to get to the heart--and mind--of its subject. Still, for what it is--an introduction--its pretty damned good!Buy ""Pandora's Box"" which includes this documentary, plus the complete ""Lulu in Berlin"": Richard Leacock's filmed interview with Louise from the mid-seventies; with Barry Paris's biography, you'll have everything!!"
3,Nice Scale But ...,It did seem quite accurate and I liked the style. The readout on mine was fine. But I had to return it because I found that if someone stepped onto it close to the sides the scale could tip toward that side and possibly cause the person to fall. Seems like they should mount the supports closer to the corners to prevent this.
3,Unimpressed,This scale for some reason has some type of material glued to the top here you stand and it arrived curled up. Looked awful I have re-glued it with Gorilla glue. It you like to fix things this scale is for you. Also it is about 4 pounds off.
3,death angel lives on,"most of you metal fans out there must have heard of death angel,one of the classic thrash bands during the late 80's and early 90's.well,the organization is another incarnation of that fabled band, the only difference is that vocal duties are handled by the guitar player.musically,it's a world of change,still metal,but much more diverse, going into alternative regions once in a while,the band has defintly grown through the years,thier control of thier instruments is honed to prefection,with the drummer standing out as a truly exeptional skin beater.all in all,a mixed bag,not for all tastes,but worth a listen anyway."
5,Great stools for the $!!,"We've been using these for the past 24 months, and I'm extremely pleased with them. They look very classy on my breakfast bar, they're very durable, and pretty easy to assemble. The frame finish, cushions, swivel mechanism and wood insert on the back still look/work like brand new after 2 years of daily use. The cushions are comfortable, and have not compressed or broken down like some cheaper stools I've used.The only issue I've had was that a couple of the screws worked loose after a few months. I just used Loctite on 'em - problem solved.I highly recommend these - for the $, I couldn't find nicer-looking stools."
1,Save Yourself The Time,"The book should have been called sleep inducing. Blah, basically what we have here is a 350 page boring article about who this guy met in his life - the bigger the name the more pages. I came away after reading half of the book wondering how this thing ever got the green light. You will not learn much here. Save your time and money."
4,MicroMiracles Provides Qualitative Insight into Enzyme Supplementation,"In this work, Dr. Ellen Cutler provides the reader with a qualitative perspective into enzyme supplementation. A nice overall view, written in an easy to understand format, with case studies and supplement formulations Dr. Cutler has found useful in her treatment of many chronic health conditions.An excellent tool for a health professional, or health conscious consumer, to gain an overview of enzyme therapy and determine if it may indeed prove useful in obtaining better overall health or in treating a specific condition."
4,Great information,"I appreciated the information in ""Discover the Healing Power of Enzymes"" by Ellen Culter. I've been using Jigsaw Health's systemic and digestive enzymes and have found them to make a huge difference in how I feel."
1,Poor,"This book was not in good shape because of wrinkles, torn edges and a thick dark line of dirt on the back cover. I would say the book was in poor shape. (Perennial Psychology of the Bhagavad-Gita by Swami Rama)"
1,the naked city(1948),The biggest problem with this dvd is that it is only playable on region 2 European eguipment. This was not mentioned in any of the advertizing for the product. It made the rest of the advertizing for the product irrelevant since I do not have region 2 playback equipment.
5,A genuine classic,"The Naked City is one of the finest crime movies ever made -- a genuine classic from the Golden Age of Hollywood. Everything about this movie is outstanding -- the plot, the script, the acting, and even the photography. If you are a movie fan and haven't yet seen The Naked City, please do yourself a favor and acquire this DVD. If you are a young movie fan, this film will show you how good the best movies from the legendary Golden Age of Hollywood actually were."
3,Maggot Brain Theory,"Okay everybody out of 4 EPs this one sounds the best. He had a decent producer on this one. The best songs on here are ""Traces of my blood type"" and ""I know you hate me""."
1,Shaker Leaks,"The shaker looks nice, but if you plan to use it for actually making drinks you will be disappointed. Like the first reviewer says, no matter how you hold the shaker, it will leak and create a mess in your kitchen/bar area. Pass."
4,Solid Watch,"This watch blends function, ruggedness, and style very well. The titanium cuts down on weight and I love that the watch isn't too flashy or chunky/bulky like so many out there. The alarm works great and is loud, and the face is designed to be very easily read. It seems very durable. The luminescence does last for a lot of the night. I have the kevlar band which looks great and has a very abrasion resistant feel to it. My one complaint so far with the watch is that the band seems to have stretched out. I'm not positive about this, but now, with the band secured on the last hole, the watch doesn't stay in one place on my wrist. I'm thin, but not thaaat thin. I wish the band could be tighter. Overall though, I feel like I've finally found the perfect watch for me. Rugged but stylish, understated but techy."
2,Maybe for professors but I'm not sure even for them,"For me to recommend a book, it has to be right, applicable, and fun to read. This book falls short on all three. Mostly on applicability: it speaks against the dangers of mind-numbing bureaucracy and close-mindedness, claiming American university physics PhD programs as the example. I had hoped for something that talked about the salaried professional once s/he's at work, not the university experience preceding it. If you want to review the worst of academic bureaucracy in order to know how to recognize and deal with it, then read this book. Otherwise skip it and just stay alert for those times when ""the system"" tries to put one over on you."
1,Undelivered DVD Concert of Roger Whittaker,"I am very disappointed with the merchandiser from U.K. Improper packaging caused damage to my ordered item. Sad to say, they have no ability to replace or notify me. Keeping me waiting for months to know the bad news. I will never deal with this store again."
4,Bernese Mountain Dog: An Owners Guide to a Happy Healthy Pet,"This book is a general guide for all breeds and does have some photos of bernese mountain dogs and it covers all types of health problems, training, and puppy info and other important issues in owning dogs, however it is in general covering all dog breeds and I would recommend ""Bernese Mountain Dogs by ""Amy Christiansen"". However, these are two of the top books that I would give to anyone who has an interest in the Bernese Mountain Dog. I presently own both books.Garret DeGraffNewton, NJ USA"
1,The internet will give you more info about bernese than this book.,"The book uses pictures of other dog breeds in the training section. Not very helpful. Large print, short book with lots of pictures. You can find more info on the breed on the internet."
3,books about berners...,This book provides a good overview for raising a puppy. Mostly generic information... I live with a berner... looking for something more specific to the breed...
2,"Maybe fine for scriptwriters, but not for the general public","Sure, the book has lots of stories, but he writes like an insider more obsessed with the process than the craft -- and he's not even that insightful about the process. In fact, Taylor never seems to have any point at all, rarely rising above a hack journalist's dialogue-splicing. Read William Goldman -- or other actual scriptwriter -- before tackling this one."
2,"Good idea, not so good material.","I have no objection to the actual design, I think it will work quite well. I am very hesitant to use it because even after several washings in hot soapy water, whenever it is exposed to hot water or any heat, you can smell a very ""plastic"" smell, and if you leave the utensil in any hot liquid, the soup or whatever actually absorbs the flavor of the plastic. I have been trying to find out if the material is food grade plastic but have not had much luck in my research."
4,I love this iron!,"I bought this iron after deciding there was no way I could justify paying $120 for a Chi. I was not disappointed with my purchase! This iron is great. It's the perfect width (I feel 1 inch is too small, 2 inches too big), and it's pretty affordable. I have tried other irons in the past, but this is by far my favorite."
3,not bad,"doesn't straighten in one pass, but it does straighten really well after a few. gets quite hot, i use the hottest setting. i live in texas, humid as crazy so, getting my curly hair straight is quite a feat."
4,good straightner,Works really nicely but the heat guard red things on the sides sometimes catch my hair - so be careful!! Its wonderful that you don't mistakenly burn your hand but if you have fine/thin hair like me the guards might pull a hair strand or two.
4,One of the best live Burrito cd's,"Originally issued by Regency in June of 1979 titled ""Live In Tokyo"", this outstanding concert cd is pivotal in the history of The Flying Burrito Brothers. The lineup is, as always, top notch: Sneeky on steel, Gib Guilbeau on fiddle and vocals, Skip Battin on bass and vocals and Ed Ponder on drums. They are obviously having a great time, and they perform flawlessly several Burrito staples and hardcore country standards with ease. The album is most notable, however, for it spawning the single 'White Line Fever' which was the first-ever Burrito recording to have chart impact. (This version of 'White Line Fever' is the best one released so far). Essential? No, only one live Burrito cd is absolutely essential, 1990's ""Encore- Live In Europe"". But it is a great cd and more than worthy of being added to your collection."
2,Lackluster,"This live set from Tokyo features Gib Guilbeau and Sneaky Pete leading a technically proficient but undistinguished group through a hodgepodge of country standards, with a few Burritos tunes sprinkled throughout. The highlight of the album is Guilbeau's ""Big Bayou"" with excellent steel guitar work by Sneaky Pete. This album is a cut below the live set ""From Another Time"", recorded in 1976 with a better lineup. OK for diehard fans, but not essential."
5,Another great book,"This is the second book of the series and they are both GREAT!, I do recomend start with the first one, full of technique and design ideas!"
5,My favorite scrapbooking idea book!,"I love this book, it has become the corner stone of my collection. Cathy Zielske has taken her basic principles and spiked them with creative wit and humor. I appreciate that she has come out of her personal comfort zone and explored new ideas that may not entirely fit into the ""clean&simple"" method. She does not take herself to seriously and has learned to apply that to her scrapbook technique. No matter how many idea books and magazines I get I always return to Clean&Simple and now the Sequel."
2,Not what I was looking for,"I didn't like this book because although it was supposed to help me figure out why I scrapbook and reasoning why I wanted to scrapbook, I was looking more for ideas, not someone elses reasonings on scrapbooking."
3,Cathy Zielske Loses Her Edge,"Some books shouldn't have sequels. Cathy Zielske's first book CLEAN AND SIMPLE SCRAPBOOKING: IDEAS FOR. . . is, to me, the Bible for scrappers. But something went terribly wrong in her followup book. Her layouts are not as crisp and clean. Her journaling tends toward the kitschy and I hate her handwritten journaling. She has left behind what she's famous for and it doesn't work to her or the reader's advantage.Buy the first book. Ignore the second. And follow her first set of ideas. You'll be glad you did."
3,Easy but a little boring...,"I am 15 and I have to read this version of ""Around The World in 80 Days."" The plot is a good idea but the book is a little boring. It is easy reading but it doesn't have too many climatic moments so far (I'm on chapter 13). I would reccomend this book only to people who have a lot of patience and like to read classics."
4,Pretty good map!!,"I am a travel agent who sells luxury travel, mostly for Americans goingto foreign countries. I give the Insight Fleximaps to my clients as gifts before they depart the US. If you have a good, old-fashioned ballpoint pen around, you can circle the hotel location on the map as""home"". My only wish is that the map could be folded a bit smaller or more square. The other nice thing is that some of my clients go to Italy over and over, so they can save this map for future vacations or business trips."
4,A good book for Beginners,"This is a great book, it is an easy read and isn't too complicated for a new Wiccan. It has great things that every new Wiccan needs to know. Loved it!!"
5,excellent watch,"When I started medical school, I started washing my hands many times daily. I decided to get a dive watch after, well, drowning two watches. I have now had this watch for 9 years and it is amazing. I have sent it to the factory twice for a new battery and whatever other regular maintenance that they do, for which they charged me $40 each time. Service has been excellent. If I outlive this watch, I'll get another one. Very high quality and accurate time. Still looks great, too. Highly recommended."
2,A chore,"Too bad the blurb on the DVD cover doesn't warn you that there will be a wailing ""pansori"" narrator (a traditional singer of stories accompanied by a single drummer) taking the place of much of the dialog. And, when it ends, the story seems so flimsy that it didn't seem to me worth 2 hours (which, incredibly, is pared down from the 8-hour traditional pansori performance).Even with its gorgeous visuals and smooth editing, even cinéastes might find this film a chore to sit thru.Definitely -- rent this one first. Or try seeingSOPYONJEfirst -- a film about some itinerant pansori singers which might get you used to that performance style."
5,Masterpiece,"One of the best-loved legends of Korea is retold in the singing tradition of Korea known as ""pansori."" Directed by one of Asia's most demanding and feared perfectionist directors, the cinematography is breathtakingly beautiful and, despite the lead characters being played by teenage, first time actors, the acting is flawless. The pansori singing is performed by a man officially designated by the Korean government as a living national treasure. The breathtaking beauty of Korean nature, a powerful story of innocent, true, and undying love, and the haunting vocal tradition of pansori combine to present an experience that I can unreservedly say is far and away the best Asian movie I have seen (rivaled only by ""Ran"") and is high on my list of the best films ever. I have yet to meet someone who was disappointed with this movie."
2,Like listening to fingernails scratch a blackboard,"This is the only foreign movie I've ever watched where I was compelled to put the TV on ""mute"" or slice off my ears with a samurai sword.That didnt help either, because through the subtitles I then realized how bad the screenplay was. ""He climbed up the ladder; he climbed down the ladder.""Cutting all this unnecesssary narration may have saved the movie; but then again, the movie may have been half as long."
2,Avoid,"If you're looking for a good Asian movie, spare yourself of this one. The story isn't bad, and it's beautiful to look at, but the traditional Korean singing throughout will have you PRAYING FOR DEATH."
5,Masked Destiney,"As usual I give Mark A. Roeder, high marks for this well written teenage coming of age novel. The two main characters Skye and Oliver are telling their seperate stories. They are not romatically involved with each other, but they work together, they go to the same school and do some socializing together. The story is fast paced, and keeps you wondering until the last word is spoken oops written. There are a lot of old friends in this story. Which is nice, as we get to see these old friends' characters develop. We come to love them even more. I am waiting for Mark's next novel with great anticipation."
5,"Love all of mark roeder's book, try them youll like them!!!",After reading just one of Mark Roeder's books on Gay Life I have now read about 10+ and enjoyed them all! Highly reccomended. Once I start reading they are hard to put down! As a fellow gay teen athlete I love to read his stories.
5,The Monster Cutting Board!,"This 16"" square extra thick cutting board lives up to my expectations. It is a nice end grain to keep your knives sharp. The only maintenance you have to be concerned about, (which will extend the life of your board), is oiling it once per month. You can use commercially available mineral spirits or olive oil."
4,A book for my aunt,Purchased Amazon gift card for aunt. She wanted to some help with her purchase as she had never purchased from Amazon before. She chose this book and was very happy when it was delivered. A happy aunt is a happy nephew and a perfect gift.
3,The last lecture,My son had to read for school and it the title of the book already gave him a terrible idea from the actual book. It was an ok book if you need an extra advice in life.
3,guala's thoughts....,"Lovely, heart warming read.... but almost everything is expected.... what i'm saying is that I've read, seen(movies), heard- almost all of this before.... but it's nice, easy and heart warming too....."
4,An inspirational touch,First I read about him and his fight against the cancer. I watched him speak on the web and then I decided that it must reside in my library.
5,Pure Magic,Everyone should watch this video! It's a user's manual for the heart. We should teach our children the essence of this lesson before we worry about all of the trappings of our present day society.
4,Adorable..,"Picture didn't match the title, but it was still adorable...my mom loved it. It's much better than actual fruitcake."
1,A calendar I've not yet seen,"This calendar looks wonderful from the picture on this site. I am an avid fan of anything that has to do with Lord of the Rings. So I bought this calendar without a second thought. When I purchsed it the website said it would be 2-3 weeks to ship. No problem. Now I've been e-mailed a notice saying 1-3 months. So this is a warning for other eager buyers. This calendar may be wonderful, if you ever get it in 2002."
4,"Nice looking, comfortable shoe","Got these in black nubuck and they wear very well. I would recommend you go up a size only if you have a wide foot as they tend to run a little big. Comfortable, though not as comfy as the Rockport."
4,Great Bass source book,"Great source book for the bass player/Kiss fan!Bass transcriptions with tab for 26 Kiss classics:Black Diamond C'mon And Love Me Calling Dr. Love Christine Sixteen Cold Gin Creatures Of The Night Detroit Rock City Deuce Firehouse God Of Thunder Hard Luck Woman Heaven's On Fire Hotter Than Hell I Love It Loud I Stole Your LoveI Was Made For Lovin' YouLick It Up Love Gun Parasite Rip It Out Rock And Roll All Nite She Shock Me Shout It Out Loud Strutter Tears Are Falling.I personally would have liked to see a few more older songs--Let me go rock and roll, two timer, rock bottom to name a few. That is the only reason I gave it a 4 instead of 5 stars because I prefer the 70 Era stuff. That's just me. Great book"
3,"Same old story, but plenty of erotic energy!","Lorissa McComas is the only reason to see this film. The story line is re-hashed and the acting is average at best, BUT... Ms McComas displays two splendid reasons to enjoy this film. Her body is enough to keep you entertained for the night. And face it, the only time guys watch these movies is when the wife or girlfriend is away for the evening. A perfect companion on a lonely Saturday night."
3,Great names not great action,"Lorissa McComas, Tane McClure, and Kim Dawson some good names of mid 90's softcore video. This video is bad because Lorissa can't act at all. All three actress get naked and provide full frontal on occasion. The sex scenes start ok with Lorissa but each one after the first gets weaker. The ladies are lovely but this video should have been much better."
4,Low-rissa,"Where has this woman been all my life? This is a very good b-movie. All the leads can act (that's a switch). The story was just average, but the dancing, soundtrack, erotic heat were top notch. Don't miss this movie!"
4,Sexy dance scenes,"The acting in this one is not that great and I wished the dance scenes had been filmed or edited better, but for me, it's the dance scenes and the eroticism that makes this a cute, light ""date movie!"" It'll get you hot with the opening shots alone!"
1,Another Forgettable Sexploitationer,"After watching ""Lap Dancing,"" I was filled with questions, like, was Lorissa McComas simply untalented or was she the best actress for the part? What was the difference between her two separate on-screen auditions at the offices of CineTel, other than the fact that she writhed all over the director? Was that an actual strip club, or was the writer confusing his neighborhood experimental/dinner theater for an adult venue? Was that Tane McClure's actual singing voice? And will I ever find the soundtrack in the cut-out bin of my local Sam Goody? Is a poorly-handled domestic violence subplot really a good idea in this kind of movie, or did the producers think that the audience likes voyeuristic sex mixed with implied wife-beating? And perhaps most importantly, is Mike Sedan merely an incompetent filmmaker or does he just hate the average viewer? All good questions, all to be left unanswered."
2,Big zero for Leighanne Wallace,"I found Tyk,Brian Littrell and Aj Mlcean to be the only reason to watch this sorry ... movie.It's very lame.Leighanne wallace is the worst up and coming actress I have seen in a long time.She needs to take some leasons.It's sad the promo team behind this ""movie"" have to have ""AJ MCLEAN AND BRIAN LITTRELL"" in big letters on the cover of the movie to get people to see it.What a waste of time and money for AJ and Brian.Two thumbs down.However Aj and Brian did great in the 10 seconds they are in the flim."
2,good intentions just aren't enough,"I think olive juice was a flim with lots of heart but not alot of talent. the script seemed poorly written, the editing was even worse and the actors...well there's a reason they aren't making 20 million a movie. with exception to dj dan and the obsessed cat woman, they fell short of what it took to make this movie believable. but i think somewhere behind it all was a good idea that just went bad."
1,lame,"This movie was slow, predictable and quite frankly stupid. It had good intentions, but didn't pull them off very well. It totally trades on lead actress Leighann Littrell's famous Backstreet Boy husband, Brian and fellow Backstreet Boy, A.J. McClean (both of whom appear in the movie). I can see why it never made it to the theaters."
4,Awesome,This movie is just a nice funny romantic comedy and a great surprise if you love the backstreet boys. I love this movie because it makes you think Enjoy!
5,It won me over,I've seen Ansel prints in the stores and in peoples homes but I never cared too much about the guy. One quiet evening the documentary was on tv. So I decided to give it a try. I was blown away by this man's life and body of work. I rarely have seen a documentary that has moved me so deeply. By panning and zooming a corner of a photo was a great peice unto itself. There will never be another artist like it. Everything after is merely an imitation of something great. I just decided to buy a copy for myself to show my friends and family. Thanks PBS!!!!
4,Larger than life,"Ansel was an obsessive compulsive who had emotional and financial peaks and valleys that mirrored the contrasts within his photographic subject matter.Many of the photos are breathtaking but cannot be adequately portrayed on screen; they are panned and zoomed to depict entire image but you lose the totality of the entire composition. Nevertheless, the documentary is a good introduction to a larger than life image on both ends of a camera lens."
4,Thank goodness for pictures like these.,"Ansel Adams is a great video. After seeing a showing of his pictures at a Tucson Museum we got excited about learning more about him. He was truly a blessing to our country both in his photographs and his work in protection of our beautiful environment. This is a very educational film and very enjoyable. If you see it, try to find a place to view his photography."
1,Disappointing Camera Work,"We are not allowed to see the photographs as Adams shot them. What we see instead are moving fragments as we are constantly subjected to panning, tilting and zooming in and out. We never see the photographs in total and get to watch them as Adams cropped them. It is like going through a photographic exhibition on a roller coaster."
1,A horrible requiem,"Stay away from this DVD. This DVD is a long somber story with constant dramatic violins humming in the background. It is the perfect tone for a warmovie but not for a documentary on Ansel Adams. Adams himself isn't really present in this film (he has about three lines of text), although there is enough footage available. Adams was a still photographer but don't expect any still photo's. Al his images are zoomed in and out and panned up and down and left and right.If you want to see a artist at work and the work he made you better buy the DVD Art Wright made with a simpel 16mm camera about Brett Weston."
2,Students Beware,"This is a well-designed book, but is marred by an incredible number of mistakes. It's truly unbelievable. I realize that these exercises can be tricky, but the publishers ought to be ashamed that, after four editions, they have allowed mistakes to remain in nearly every assignment.Why is it that the majority of first-semester music students can find so many mistakes, yet the professionals who put the material together can not see glaring errors that jump right off the page? This is the most unreliable text I have ever used. It's not unusual to find a mistake here and there in technical books, but I identified literally dozens in just the first half we covered in Theory 1 class.If you are required to use this book for a class, then you don't have any choice--just be very careful. If you are studying on you own, without the benefit of others to help catch all the errors, then you will want another book."
1,the most horrible theory book in the world,"this was the text book that was used in my college intro to harmony and tonal counterpoint. it was full of mistakes and was very difficult to follow. my professor even expressed his hatred of this horrible, horrible book, but yet my university feels inclined to continue using it. if you really want to learn voice leading and harmony, find another book."
2,"Used in college, but too many errors for the price","I use this to teach 1st year music theory at the college level. This book, I do not like. There are so many errors. Not only in the text, but also in the back of the book where they provide answers. Even those are error-filled. Really, publisher, how can you justify a textbook (soft back) pock-marked with technical errors, for almost $100? yikes. Clearly publisher should be issuing either partial refunds or get the 6th edition out already. This book is now 13 years old, that's 13 years of students fumbling through your errors. Some of my fav'rit errors are the font errors, where the wrong symbol is printed. Clearly, time to change texts."
4,Cool Sci-Fi,This movie is pretty good taking into account how old it is and the idea is well thought out. It does take the show a while to get interesting and going on the theme but that wait is worth the time. I know alot of people today would not like to this show cause of the low budget effects but as far as an interesting sci-fi film I enjoyed it alot.
2,Not very good,"And wow, David Hartman is truly a terrible actor, yikes! I like the airship, and the airship captain. The rich dude is okay too, the rest of the acting and writing is not very good though. The dog is cute."
4,Lesser known classic,"This movie is a childhood favorite of mine. What kid doesn't daydream about building a bright orange, chrome and gold studded zeppelin, flying to a place that no one else can get to(the top of the world) (go figure), and discovering a hidden oasis populated by a lost faction of Vikings?! Fun movie that compared to flicks nowadays will make you sit back and laugh. You'll enjoy this blast from the past movie!"
4,good family fun,"I happened on this film at a local video store and remembered on a hollow earth conspiracy list that this film was based upon the Eskimo legend that the lost viking colony of Greenland actually did not die out, but went north where there was more game and food.In any event I did enjoy the film and reminded me of the caliber of films that made movies like ""The sound of music"" such enjoyable family fun. Yes, there are plot holes, and the acting is not perfect - but this is not the point since kids really aren't that picky when it comes to these kinds of things. And I as an adult still liked this film as well. It is a good story, with good set design. Perfect for elementary school level kids and up."
2,Sizing waaaay off,"I got these pants along with the matching hoodie a few days ago. I ordered a size large because according to their size chart for these items, that was my size. The sizing runs very big I feel. I think for these to look fitted and sleek like Juicy Couture suits and the way the photo represents them here on amazon, I'd need a SMALL. These are huge, not nice and lowrise like the photo and just REALLY ill fitting. I'll pay a little more next time and get Juicy."
3,Nice looking - hard to set up.,I got the case in good shape. It looked nice and looks good on the wall. The hard thing was that it did not come with good hanging hardware and it was hard to attach the dart board to the case and then onto the wall. It would be perfect if it had pre-connected hardware to hang on the wall and dartboard.
4,Great Quality,"Solid, heavy, nicely stained, heavy duty hinges, with nice magnet catches, doors close evenly, great whiteboards, storage for 2 sets darts inside, tray for pens....well worth the money.Single drawback? Mounting it to the wall can be challenging and requires some expertise greater than turning a screwdriver. Included screws don't really do the job (used much stronger ones). Since you are trying to get the exact required height for the dartboard AND keep it squared and centered, some kind of template for hole drilling would have been nice (had to make my own). This is the only reason it doesn't get 5 stars.Otherwise, great dart cab."
2,construction problems,"ProsStain job was good. Joint construction looked good (although I'm no expert). Felt lining inside is a nice feature.ConsThe right door's natural closed position was still open an inch. The hinges did not appear adjustable in order to fix this. Then I noticed the other door was a bit loose and tried to tighten the hinge screws, but they just spun in place. Minor, but even when I forced the right door closed, the mid-line didn't match up and looked sloppy. I realize these are defects/damages which may not be present in a replacement cabinet, but there were enough problems on this unit that I was convinced to spend a bit more for something of hopefully better quality.One more thing, they don't show it in the picture, but there is a pretty large ""Accudart"" logo glued onto the front of the left door near the bottom."
4,The best of hungarian Gypsies,"This CD contains well known songs and compositions (some appear more than once, but by different artists) played by the best gypsy bands and players in Hungary. You can find pieces played by Sandor Deki Lakatos or by Budapest gypsy orchestra (of 100 members) conducted by Laszlo Berki. I like especcialy the song A small house on the hill, played by L. Berki and his (small) band. Very nice and fast variation. Worth are also the cimbalom solos in other pieces and well known (and often imitated) Laszlo Gulyas' song Szeki muzika. You can hear variety of violinists and their different ways of playing the same song.To mention some bad sides of the album, the names of the artists and of the songs contain mistakes. Sometimes one artist is mentioned on two places with differend name. It can confuse people who don't know the artists well.But I hardly recommend this album to all who are interested in hungarian gypsy music. This is a very good start."
1,Why Not Widescreen?,"Film distributors are either incompetent idiots or lazy slobs, because they release a film in its original theatrical aspect ratio to cable TV, but they release the same movie only in the fullscreen (pan & scan) format on DVD?WTF?Thanks a lot, LionsGate."
4,Not Bad,"This movie was pretty good. It takes a little while to really get going, but I like the plot and ending."
1,Ricochet Misfire,The fine book by Robin Cody was turned into a pathetic cartoon by this poorly executed disaster. It was simply a shame to behold. Get the book and treasure it. Burn the film.
5,A Must Have!!,"I love Leap Frog for my two children, but these videos are by far the best thing they have come up with! I have an 18 month old son who knows the sounds of every letter in the alphabet because of this video. My 3 1/2 year old daughter is starting to read because of these videos. They love to watch them and the learning has been amazing. I can't say enough good things about them. If you are trying to decide if you should spend the money on them, do it. You will not regret it."
5,Leap Frog has done it again,I absolutely love these dvd's. Both my children (23 months and 3 years)love them. A perfect addition to the Leap Frog products. A MUST!!!!!!!!
2,Leap Frog Gift Set Letter Factory Talking Word Factory w/plush,"This item I am sure would have been great. But, after about 2 or 3 weeks of waiting with this item on back order I never got the product. So, it is hard to actually reaview it. I did end up just purchasing the DVD by itself and my twins liked it ok. They really don't watch it that often though. It is ok but a little expensive on the price if you ask me."
5,Awesome! Best gift ever!,My son really loves these videos and when we first got them he wanted to watch them every day. I think they definitely helped him learn his letters and words. He loves books and anything with the alphabet. I would totally recommend these for any parent who's child is ready to learn letters.
1,Stereotypical and Generalized!,I read this book for a college course on classroom management and diversity and was sorely disappointed. Payne's advice and comments are based on only her findings (her private publishing company does not have to justify research) and perpetuated the stereotypes she was trying to fight even more. It didn't make me feel more prepared for dealing with impoverished students but made me angry with her. I would look to other books for advice!
5,Perfect Book for Understanding my Students!,"I wish I had read this book 9 years ago, when I first started working in an impoverished school. I have had to discover a lot of what's in this book on my own, with mixed success. Payne has finally given me a way to teach my students how to write. I won't feel like I'm bashing my head against a wall now. She's also given me insight into how my ""middle class"" values don't automatically transfer over to my students. My job is not easy. But this book gives me a framework from which I've gained more understanding."
1,Generalizations,"I think anybody who reads this with a critical eye will see that things are over simplified. I'm a white middle class teacher, and I was offended by several of its inplications. Not worth time or money."
4,Understanding Poverty,This is a well thought out book about poverty and conceptions/misconceptions. I is by now a classic.
4,Framework for Understanding Poverty,I have had many discussions about this book in the past. It seems to have found disfavor among the newer ideas concerning the current rush of immigrants into the country. Ms. Payne's ideas were once credible. I think she needs to take a new look at poverty in America. Some of the parameters have changed. It's still an interesting read.
2,disappointing 80% and fantastic 20%,"I borrowed Payne's Framework for Understanding Poverty from our local library. I don't know that she's THE leading US expert on mindsets of poverty, middle class and wealth. Sort of pretentious. She separated out behaviors, values, characteristics of the three socio-economic classes. I was appalled at what she claimed to be economic factors - all so often they are matters of diagnosis of LD that is most commonly exposed in poverty and least often exposed among the wealthy. I liked the holistic approach - that many factors affect folks beyond just money! This book is poorly researched, most of the time interestingly presented book. For parents and teachers, not a bad read some of the time - but, don't believe all that you read in this book. For employers, policymakers and service providers, skip it. It's not a bad read from the public library. I wouldn't buy the $22 4th edition over the $2 used 3rd edition."
1,WARNING - stay away from Ruby Payne!,"If you ever hear that your school is considering using Ruby Payne's methods as a way to ""fix"" poor people, I caution you strongly to reconsider. Not only has she not used any real research to back up her claims, but her writing is absolutely FILLED with classist, racist, and terminology that only belittles those whom she supposedly is trying to help. This does absolutely nothing to help further the cause of helping those who are poor and/or working class. One thing that is important to note: her books are all self-published. This means that unlike with academic works, there are not a multitude of editors making sure that what is written can be validated through research."
3,Common Sense & a Touch of Important Info,"I had to read this book for a college course. The author's main point is common sense. To successfully interact with, lead and educate a student or employee...it is highly beneficial for one to become familiar with the mores of the student/employee's culture and / or socio-economic level. Teaching students/employees to behave in the manner of the dominant ""class"" will help them succeed as well. That's what this book will teach you."
3,Interesting ideas,"I have read the negative reviews and the positives...the book is not all five stars. It is not poverty that elicits certain behaviors, but the values & education level the family holds. I don't believe poverty equates to all the things Ms. Payne suggests, but values and level of education do. That is why we have so many ""wealthy"" people in America who behave like those Ms. Payne has characterized as the poverty class--their values and education are lacking. I work with immigrants, many of them display the characteristics of the ""wealthy"" set, though they are quite poor. The book is a generalization, and there are truths and like any generalization, there are dangerous falsehoods. It is illuminating for me to read it though and see that the behavior I see in my classroom is more universal than I thought. So for me it helps in some abstracted way, but nothing to herald as fact."
1,Biased stereotyping,"I simply cannot understand the rave reviews that this book has received. The 'research' is outdated and based on 3rd party anecdotes. I found it to be extremely biased and obviously written by someone who has not known poverty. It is not a peer reviewed publication, but rather self-published, which casts further doubt on its validity. I read it as it was used for professional development in my school district, but I was very disappointed. I work in a school with much diversity (23 language backgrounds) and high poverty, and while reading with my demographics in mind, I found myself thinking over and over again that the author has a very narrow world view of the culture of privilege and how to achieve it - dress like her, talk like her, think like her is all it takes... What this book does accomplish is to make those of us who are privileged smile and find affirmation that we have done it right and those poor things who are not so privileged just need to try to be like us."
5,Excellant,"I have worked for the Texas Department of Human Services for the past ten years, and wish I had read this book before I started. Understanding the culture of poverty is needed in order to facilitate the growth of those in poverty on the economic social and educational ladder. While this book addresses the overall aspects of the poverty culture, it fails to properly document the other aspects that affect the learning process, such as child abuse and cultural differences. In all, this is a book worth reading for not only teachers but anyone who works with those in lower income levels. The book is a treasure."
1,Racist and ignorant understanding of poverty,"Dr. Ruby Payne uses anecdotes to support her racist and ignorant ""framework for understanding poverty"". All this book does is continue to perpetuate stereotypes."
2,Sterotypical,"...There are two pages in the book that discuss hidden rules among the three prominent socio-economic classes (wealthy, middle class, poverty) and resources. Otherwise the book is extremely offensive and absent of relevant content relating to poverty and children in poverty..."
3,Quick informational read,"I purchased the book based on a recommendation in one of my education classes. I am a middle class teacher who teaches in a very poor neighborhood. While the book did give many insights about the generalizations of the different classes, I was hoping for more direction as far as implications for instruction, which the book completly lacked. There were a few case studies which were informative and gave a little perspective from a child's or parent's point of view, but not many solutions or suggestions were provided. Additionally, I was dissappointed to see that almost half of the book was simply references."
1,It doesn't even deserve one star,"I think everyone should notice that Ruby Payne is a rich white Texan who self-published this book. I suspect that is because no publisher would want to be associated with her racist, stereotypical ideology. She makes claims about the three socio-economic levels of our society that will do nothing other than further stratify the classes of ""wealthy"" i.e. white and the ""poor"" i.e. blacks. It is horrifying, as an educator to know other teachers are buying her books and attending her seminars to learn how to teach urban youth, yet they are being taught nothing but insulting generalizations about minorities in our country. Payne is nothing short of a white supremacist."
4,"priceless information, less than stellar organization","Ruby Payne combines anecdotal observations culled from a lifetime spent as an educator with solid data sources to provide a wealth of insight and understanding about poverty and its many layers. This book taught me many things about the dynamics of poverty and the complexities associated with rising from it. Everyone, regardless of income level, should read her descriptions of the ""hidden rules"" of each economic layer of society. My only complaint about this book is the way it is structured. It is written primarily for other educators and is set up as a quasi-workbook. It would be great to also offer a version which is a regular narrative aimed at a general audience."
4,Very Interesting,"I thought I understood poverty..it means your poor or have little money. I was wrong, it turns out there was a lot I didn't know about poverty. I work as an educator and in our school people are not divided by race, but by social/economic differences. I found this book very helpful. Payne does a great job high lighting and explaining the different social norms in each class (poverty, middle class, wealth) and why people in these classes think the way they do, say what they say and what needs ,however basic, drive them.The quizes (ex: Could You Survive in Poverty..etc) are great and interesting. I found some of the scenarios to be shocking, perhasp because to some people they are similar to their own lives, and very eye opening. This book has given me a better understanding of some of the students I encounter everyday."
5,Great insights for reasons why some kids fail in schools,"There are so many things that we don't think about when we look at children from different social classes. I had never thought of my upbringing as middle-class, but I did bring middle-class values to my education and that made all the difference in the world. This book showed me why some children have so many problems adapting to the expectations schools have of them and how, as a teacher, I can adapt to reach these children. Children may have to learn the social norms of school before they can even begin to learn how to read and write. This book gives educators a start to learning how to integrate these children into the school system without expecting them to turn their backs on their home cultures."
5,An insightful and needed book,"In this book, Ruby Payne successfully argues that poverty is not just a material situation but an entire subculture. People who know no other way of life do not adapt well to middle class norms, which in many parts of society, especially education, are normative. She presents a fascinating and challenging way to look at families and students in poverty, why they behave the way they do in school and often don't succeed, and what works to help it. She present something that seems very true but is going to be very hard for some people to swallow - those who think that middle class culture is normative and simply want to see people pull themselves up by their own bootstraps (hence what you can read on some of the negative reviews)."
2,poor,"This book does not provide any 'understanding' of poverty. It gives a very superficial and stereotype picture of poverty children and families. In fact, these stereotypes are part of the social problem of poverty itsef!"
1,Beware Ruby Payne,"This book perpetuates the institutionalized racism and classism that creates students who are unsuccessful in schools. Payne, whose ""research"" is anecdotal at best, completely unverified at worst, suggests that teachers teach to poverty, instead of fighting the social injustices that cause it. She works from the deficit theory of poverty, which has been widely discredited since the 60s, and her anecdotal examples are racist stereotypes.This book makes white, middle-class teachers think they understand poverty, when in reality, the advice she gives teachers perpetuates poverty and does nothing to address the complex causes of it. Ruby Payne is laughing all the way to the bank."
5,"A ""Must Read"" for Anyone Working With Children or Adults Who Live at the Poverty Income Level","This book is a ""must read"" for anyone working with adults or children who live at or below the poverty income level. It's very difficult for middle and upper income people to understand why those at the poverty level seem to act in self-defeating ways. This book gives an understanding of this behavior and details effective teaching methods to use when working with low income students or workers. The ideas in this book will be valuable to school teachers and/or supervisors in a work environment."
1,Seller should be banned,This seller never shipped the book and never returned my emails as to why. I ordered it for a course I had to teach on poverty and did not receive my book on time for the class. This seller should not be allowed to sell on the site.
2,who knows?,"I have been told this is a great book for teachers in poverty-stricken areas. I ordered this book based on those recommendations. However, the ship date kept being pushed back later and later repeatedly by Amazon. I eventually cancelled the order and will seek this book elsewhere."
2,Disappontment,"I bought this video thinking that it was going to be a documentary showing the war as viewed by the North Vietnamese government, what it actually turned out to be is a photographers autobiography.It would be more accurately titled ""Tim Page - The War Years""."
5,Vietnam's Unseen War,I was surprised by the images from the Communist POV. Tim Page was a bonus as the man meeting his Vietnamese counterparts. The extra with the young woman visiting her parent's homeland and travelling by kayak was also eye-opening. Vietnam is a country that needs better media representation.
2,waste of money,"Looks nice, sound poor, comparable to the sound of record players in the 60s. Unable to add additional speakers. Any CD burned from albums or tape cassette's only play on the Crosley unit. CD's are useless on any other source, really unhappy with being unable to listen to CD's while on the road, reason for purchasing in the first place. Did my homework before purchasing the unit, initialy liked the unit and could live with the OK sound. Should never have dicarded the box, would return otherwise. Spend a little more money and buy a stereo system unless of course you like the retro look."
1,Sadly I got sick and couldn't return it,"I read other reviews on Crosley products and felt comfortable buying this audio system. However, I wasted my money. The CD player does not work at all. I wanted 3-disc CD player, but this one just doesn't work. It just won't play. Period. Also, I'm no stereophile, but the overall sound quality is very poor. I listen to the radio, but the CD won't play and the cassette and record player sound awful.The one positive is it's really very beautiful. But, I can't recommend this product to anyone."
1,piece of junk. thought i had winner.,"worked for a coupla months, now cds wont play and the dealer ,crosley and amazon not working with me. trying to return to dealer getting no response waitng waiting. i lked to purchase another system but very hesitant dont want to get burned again. i have records and cds have to listen to the radio ok sometimes but not always."
3,Not The Version I Was Looking For,"When I bought this CD, I was hoping one of the remixes on it was the dance version of the song I kept hearing on the top 40 radio stations. Instead, these are slow versions of the song. Although these songs are okay, I was hoping for something with a little more pep."
5,not a country person,"I totally dislike country, and still do. I heard ""Amazed"" on the radio and my heart melted! It's the perfect love song! I definately want this to be played at my wedding when I'm older!"
5,Very nice,"this is a good quality,nice product.Im happily shocked-thought for the price I may get a bit of a lower manufactured item.I would pay full price for this item-is a great gift-I had mine monagrammed for a friend as a gift.Money well spent all around!"
3,Could Have Been Better,"Not bad for a B-movie. The idea of a disturbed kid locked up in his room all of his life with a drive in that plays nothing but hack em up movies all the time in perfect view from his window,and escaping to the drive in to perform the only thing he knows is a good idea for a horror flic.But i was dissapointed when i couldnt see most of the kills because the kept flashing over to the drive in screen as the kid (Billy) was going for his own kill.Whenever they did show him kill there was hardly any blood.I mean,come on.B-movies are supposed to have too much blood.Also gonna have to complain about the picture quality.Wasnt very good at all in some parts. I would rent before you buy it.This is a movie i watched 1 time and will probably never watch again.On a scale of 1 - 10, i will give it a 6"
1,A TROMATIC EXPERIENCE,"DRIVE IN has all the ingredients of your standard slasher flick:*THE OLDEST LOOKING TEENAGERS IN RECENT CINEMA*INCREDIBLY BAD ACTING*STUPID KIDS DOING STUPID THINGS*HORRENDOUS EDITING AND LIGHTING*A KILLER WHO IS ABOUT AS FRIGHTENING AS BARNEY THE DINOSAUR*AN OUT OF PLACE, IF FUN, MUSICAL SCORE*CLIPS FROM FIVE TROMA STUDIO MOVIES WITH GORE, GORE AND MORE*THE LESSON THAT HAVING SEX OR SMOKING POT WILL LEAD TO SLAUGHTERThe director obviously intended to give us a moral lesson in the effect of horror movies on the our psyches.Well trust me folks. This movie should have no effect. It offers further ammunition to the fact that slasher movies may have seen their day. When's the last time you saw a really good and imaginative one???"
1,B movie at it's best?,"I cannot believe that this film got good reviews. I usually depend on this site to be a reliable source for films and music, but come on! A retarded boy wandering around in a drive-in killing people? Well, for some reason I thought the plot sounded compelling, but after watching this film I felt the only retarded thing was myself for wanting to see a film like this. Do NOT even waste your time on this tripe."
1,"terrible, terrible movie","I have myself see over hundreds of horror movies, and this ranks in the top 5 worst i have ever seen.Trust me, no deaths on camera, ridiculous plot, boring, slow, and awful acting.Stay far away, I wouldnt even rent it!!"
3,Scared!! To Install or Not To Install.........,"I have given this 3 stars as I haven't installed it yet.I recently ordered this product as I had a problem with my Norton updates (they work now) searched the web and found that this product is highly recommended.I am now slightly aprehensive, possibly even scared as the title suggests, because after reading the reviews on this site I have noticed a lot of 5 star and many 1 or 2 star reviews. The problem is a large proportion of the 5 star reviews are by 'A Software User'. I suspect that 'A Software User' eats his or her lunch in the Trend Micro canteen. If this is correct then the overall legitimate rating of this software looks pretty bad.I don't know how fast I'll be loading this software now, will I experience 5 star results or disasterous 1 star results?"
1,"Product is MAYBE average, the support stinks","I'm really not sure what all the hoopala is about this product. Under it's ""protection"" I ended up with an ""infection"" that ultimately caused my PC to stop functioning altogether (and yes, I religiously downloaded the updates). Luckily, I managed to save my data. While this was happening I was trying to get some help from the Trend Micro support organization. I had escalated the problem and went through many push-ups to provide the information they requested. In the end, they stonewalled my case while I watched my PC die on the vine. Had I known they didn't care I wouldn't have bothered. I had naively thought they might care to find out what was infecting my PC so that they could apply the knowledge gained to other customers. After all, that IS their BUSINESS. I'll take Norton back thank you very much."
2,Promising but FLAWED,"Norton's 2004 was seriously flawed and allowed the Netsky to get on my computer. So I tried PC-Cilllin. It works fine in Real-Scan mode. But on both of my computers it froze while executing manual scans. I called tech support which was very polite. But when I mentioned the tendency of the program to freeze on manual scan mode, the very polite tech support person told me the Real-Time scan mode was taking care of things. He pretty much ignored my complaints about the fact it freezes in manual mode even after I repeated the complaint several times. If it happened on only one computer, I could chalk it up to some idiosychrasy. But the fact it happens on both, means that the program needs some work.I finally switched to McAfee Virus Scan 2004 which so far seems faster and more stable. Right now it looks like McAfee is the one to get."
2,Beware!,"I ordered this product because of all the praising reviews I read on the Amazon site. After installing it I only got problems (program could not update; I could not send emails; various error messages). I spent hours on the phone with tech support, only to be frustrated more for it was a waste of time with no resolution yet. Very disappointing...!!I give it 2 stars instead of 1 for I am still hoping that at some time it may work and I may then experience what all those glorious reviews are all about."
1,False Sense of Security,"This product was advertised as providing anti-virus and firewall functionality. It did provide Trend Anti-Virus functionality, which I respect and have previously recommended to friends. It does not, however, provide competent firewall functionality. After installing the product, my other computer (running Norton AV and ZoneAlarm firewall) started immediately complaining about receiving network traffic from the PC-Cillin machine. I have not had this problem before using PC-Cillin and having since uninstalled PC-Cillin, am no longer experiencing this problem. I've experimented with a lot of firewall software over the past several years (ZoneAlarm, Tiny, Tiny Professional, Sygate) and never seen similar behavior. This product may be a good price and may be easy to install, but I'm taking my money elsewhere."
5,Works Great!,I installed PC-cillin a couple of weeks ago and it's working great. Installation was a snap. It also has both anti-virus and firewall capabilities.
2,INFERIOR WHEN COMPARED,i bought pc-cillin based on amazon reviews and was happy until by chance i compared it to zone alarm pro on a 15 day free trialzone alarm pro makes me feel more secure it let me know in detail of security violations attempts in small unobstrusive windows you can really see that the program is protecting your computer A LOT MORE than pc-cillin. Since i installed zone alarmi notice there is less work for lavasoft a program designed to scan your computer for files and cookies that may dig into your personal info. in sum it is my assesment that zone alarm is better than pc-cillin perhaps much better specially the firewall
1,Don`t waste your time.,This program is not good.Caused my system to crash.Trend Micro tech support is no good.
3,Big Mistake I Think?,I purchased the product and download it. It actually was very easy to install and use for the most part. The only problems I had was my e-mails kept timing out when sending and the other issue was I couldn't do updates. I kept getting an error (An error occured while connecting to the internet. Please make sure your internet connection is properly functioning & try again.)and this prevents me from updating. At this point I have had to un-install it on my computer. Technical Support could not figure out my problem. Until I send them info from my computer they can't help. Beware of this product!!!
1,Dont waste your money ..,I bought it and its awful...I have Cable and it slows it down...had to delete it from my system and go back to the other software I was using....now everything is running great again
1,Dont waste your money ..,Its awful...it slows down your PC and has conflits with other programs...I bought it and i sure am sorry I did... Its awful..dont waste your money on it.....
4,The best!!!,"Good: Less of a system hog than Norton; caught 2 viruses Norton didn't; comes with firewall, etc.; scan a computer on a network; downloadable; scan on their website before you buy - I filled out a survey and saved 20%!Bad: Had to uninstall Zone Alarm Pro 4 (a firewall, also the best, but the PC-cillin firewall is probably fine) to install PC-cillin Internet Security 2004 - was able to reinstall ZAP4 afterwards though - otherwise I would have given it 5 stars.Bottom line: PLEASE Don't waste time or money on anything else - I did, and I regret it!"
5,really helped my lawn,"this really works. I have a 100+lbs dog & his urine kills the grass. Now after using this product there are less patches in my grass. Just rake up the dead grass & re-seed or there will be a patch of weeds. I also started him slowly on the treats because I did not want to upset his stomach & I wanted his body to get used to them. So I did one a day for a week, then two a day and so on. Also, keep using this product through the winter or the urine will go through to snow & defeat the purpose. I cut down his dosage in the winter because of the snow & rain. His urine will be diluted a bit.Also these smell really bad but my dog loves them."
2,Don't know yet how it protects the grass,"Our Great Dane spits these out as often as not, although he can usually be coaxed into eating them. I don't know whether or not it helps the grass yet."
5,Essential to Understanding Rural School Sociology,"Do not go into rural school systems without reading this book first. The four systems studied offer an unexpected richness and diversity of history, development, experience and current conditions. It is unlikely that ""outsiders"" could anticipate the broad possibilities represented by the systems described in this book. The book does an exellent job of placing their current conditions in the context of their history, both sociological and political. It should be required reading for anyone contemplating ""reforming"" rural schools."
4,ANTHEM of DIAMONDS,"So you think all Scientologists are BAD? So do I; Tom is an exception who plays piano with a clarity & brilliance (tone-wise) that is rather sparkling & gem-like. It took awhile to really appreciate the bare bones production approach. In the years I've owned this disc, I've grown to enjoy the music with repeated exposure. I would love to have heard a Clarinet added to a few of the tracksThe Henry Kaiser duets are a definite bonus & make for a rich, intelligent virtuosity between the two. No piano player could have been much starker a contrast to the style of Ron McKernan (Pigpen) when T. C. joined the Dead. Here in a Bride Stripped Bare fashion you can hear the uniqueness of his rather ""avant"" style. Also though you'll hear touches of Country & Boogie-Woogie.All around a satisfyingly unique solo outing."
1,Tom is just bad w/ out the dead!,"Why did he quit his day job? Now all he is, is a pianist with out a band. Sorry tom better luck next time."
4,Braggs Healthy Heart,I bought this book used for $.98 and it was very new as I could see. Its wonderful and now I am looking for their book Healthy lifestyle. The current book is chock full of good information.
2,"Larin Ramps...1000# Capacity??? OK, But NO MORE!!!","The price was right and they said they could handle 1000# for the pair.I drove my zero turn mower onto my trailer and the ramps bent severely.Checking the weight of my mower, it came in just under 1000# itself. I guess my 180# was just too much for the ramps.You'd THINK they'd build in a little cushion!"
5,Good,This is a really great song. Don't let people tell you differently. This song is old now but its still one of the best songs I've heard in awhile. BUY THIS this is an instant classic and is an amazing song.
3,Are you an academic?,"Then this strenuously researched and exhaustively detailed exegesis is for you. Footnotes in abundance! Dry as the Sahara!Interested in an accessable overview of the history of the development of Afro/Brasilian music leading to what we now know as ""samba""? Then don't be fooled by the ecstatic dancer on the cover, we're talking impenetrable doctoral thesis material here.On that level, it's a great piece of source material with a lot of history to offer.Want an informative yet easy read on the subject? Google it and almost any other offering will deliver.-Carl (aka Carlinhos)...(...)"
3,As expected,"I had to read this for a class, so it wasn't something I loved. However, the writing is very accessible and the topic fairly interesting, if you enjoy the complexities of culture formation."
2,"nice idea, but too large and too floppy","They had a great idea, but for day to day use this keychain is too large and too floppy. It's easily going to be torn and disfigured riding around in your pocket or purse. Give it a pass and look for something more practical."
2,"The Good, the Bad, and the Awful","Despite the title, this tape is actually 4 segments of approx. 1/2 hour each. Seg 1: Bloopers. Good shots, good narration, good soundtrack. Mostly college hockey clips. Worth watching. Seg 2: Fight and hits (not bloopers). Decent quality clips, narration, and music. Good hits. Worth a watch. Seg 3: Bloopers. Fair clips, stupid music. The narration will make you want to take your own life. Watch this segment only if bored, and PLEASE mute the moronic narrator. Seg 4: Bloopers. Fair to poor quality shots. Narration is poor, but not quite as annoying as Segment 3. Music is awful. As with Segment 3, if you watch it, I highly recommend watching it muted. You could easily skip this segment. Overall, it's probably worth getting for the first 2 segments, but realize you're only getting about 45 minutes of anything worth watching."
4,So far so good,"These adapters seem sturdy enough. If you need an RCA-to-1/4"" mono adapter, these should be fine, and the price is certainly reasonable.I had some that I bought at Radio Shack a few years ago for three times the price, and the cement that holds the tips inside the shaft would fail. When I removed the adapter from the jack it was plugged into, the tip would remain in the jack. It was very difficult to remove it. So far this has not happened with these.I have some similar adapters that are at least twenty years old, and I've never had a problem with them. These are not quite as substantial as the old ones. I hope these will do as well."
5,Bomb *** Diggy,"Louie Knuckles has done it again. Along with Nemesis, and L.R. Hoox, First Platoon will blow up in '99."
4,Good cookbook,"Contains a variety of recipes. Good ideas though not a ""couldn't put it down"" read. It gives good ideas on using tofu."
4,Giant book of Tofu,"Great cook book for Tofu users. I love the pictures & simple instructions. I thought it would be Vegan based. I just subsitute the eggs,cheese,& milk with Soy milk, Soy Cheese and egg replacer."
1,lasted 1 year,"Initially, the scale seemed to do pretty well; however, once it was time to replace the battery a year after purchase, the scale simply stopped working. With the lifetime warranty you can return the scale to the company and have them send a replacement, but the shipping cost is on you. I decided to go ahead and get the replacement ... and was disappointed after paying 1/2 of my original cost for shipping that I did not receive the exact model in return.Check out the Tanita brand. I haven't had one I haven't liked yet! Plus, they have brands that monitor body fat."
1,Piece of junk!,"This scale doesn't even deserve one star, but that is the lowest rating I could give it. This scale has never consistently worked. Sometimes it would never even come on. Other times it would come on but would shut off as soon as you stepped on it. Now if it comes on it displays a bunch of junk or an error message. Do not buy this scale!!!"
1,Stopped working after 2 weeks,"The scale is very attractive and looks just as pictured online. However, after two weeks of flawless use, it simply stopped working for no identifiable reason. Amazon is very good about returns, so I have requested a replacement. Had I paid any more than $19 (on sale in Dec. 2005), I would have requested a refund and spent the money on another scale. For the price, I'll give it one more try."
4,The warranty is very good!,"The LED screen on my scale also stopped working after about 9 months. However, I found my experience with Taylor customer service to be exceptional. I didn't even have to pay for shipping! They sent UPS out to my house to pick up the broken scale and they are fixing it or replacing it at no cost to me. I don't think they make this exact model anymore. It is the prettiest scale I've used, though."
3,Not quite there,"Dena is an excellent jazz pianist with a pleasant voice that she puts to good use in most of the tracks here, but much too often, after a good vocal start, we are treated to extended instrumental interludes featuring her improvisational skills at the keyboard, which is really more suitable for a jazz festival than for armchair listening. I have qualms about some of the arrangements as well, which often feature dissonant horns that destroy the mood of the song - the effect is somewhat jarring. Dena is best at the soft ballads, and it would be great if she could make an album where she does just that. As it is, this one shows a consummate professional at work, one a bit too preoccupied with the technical side of the music to make the result connect emotionally on a consistent level."
5,For every Christian,"I am not a theologian or pastor. I am an ordinary Christian, housewife and homeschooling mom. But I read a lot to help me live closer to Jesus. This is by far the best and most helpful book I've read in years. Dr. Jones has many helpful examples and life applications for slowing down and living a more deliberate life. If you've bought or read The Purpose Driven Life, you need this book to be the other side, the balance to your purpose. I fully intend to read it again, to savor it with slowness and apply it more deeply to my daily living."
5,One of the best,"I am reading this book for the second time, after having read all the others in order and enjoying every one of them. After the TV version I felt compelled to go back and re-read the book to find all the discrepancies and distortions that kept me shaking my fist at the TV screen and saying, ""That wouldn't have happened that way!"" Hillerman writes a good mystery; but, more than that, he evokes a time and place in his kindly and careful delineation of the Navajo culture of the Southwest. The tension among the various characters is sensitive and real. No stereotypes here. He is such a good writer that the writing does not draw attention to itself. There are no snags or quagmires to get in the way of the pure pleasure of a good story.Meanwhile, Hillerman is teaching us about the Navajo people in a way that textbooks and lectures cannot."
4,I learnt something,I like this book because of the concept of the skinwalkers. I am happy to not have to beleive in them but it is fascinating to have a small door to a completely different culture opened. Not to mention he is the best detective novellist.
5,Excellent!,"Another Hillerman treat, thoroughly, enjoy the mystery and refernce to Navajo culture. My only disappointment is that I have now read all of his books!"
4,Excited to read more,This is my first Tony Hillerman book. So glad i chose this as I am looking forward to continuing the series.
2,damn this book was boring,"it looks ok and starts halfway interesting, but once you get 50 pages into the book it becomes unbearable. he walks around the desert trying to find some murderers. i had to read this for school and it was torture."
3,Average Hillerman,"I always enjoy a good Hillerman novel. This story, while fairly typical, didn't engage my interest as much as other Jim Chee novels, but it did keep me reading. It was an interesting introduction to the relationship that develops in later novels between Jim Chee and Joe Leaphorn."
5,Skinwalkers,"Anything Tony Hillerman does in my opinion is well worth reading. But I am a big fan of the Leaphorn, Chee mysteries anyway."
4,Fabulous suspense!,"And the setting is marvellous too. The book is set right smack in the middle of the Large Reservation in the State of Utah. This is the first book in the Joe Leaphorn/Jimmy Che series, and it certainly is a good one. These two wonderful detectives are caught in the middle of a bunch of murders that seem to lead back to witchcraft in the Navajo nation. Hillerman makes his setting come alive and the people in his books are real. In it we learn a lot of Navajo folklore. I think it will certainly be worth pursuing the other books in this series since Hellerman seems to make this world his own."
3,a light mystery evokes Navajo country,"On my second Hillerman mystery I am struck by how simple and easy his prose is: schoolkids could easily read and enjoy this writing. Adult readers, though, will be entertained by a quick and absorbing read. This book has a very rushed ending--I'd like to see Hillerman take more time, more words, to tell his tale."
3,Bradley's mistake,"Generally, I am a big fan of productions done specifically for PBS. While this series certainly provided a reasonable history of Egypt, my school-aged daughter and I were horrified about 8 minutes into the first episode to see CORN being depicted as a grain in ancient Egypt. Corn (a New World food)...really...my kid even caught that one! I think the director should have done additional homework. Otherwise, the academics were informative"
5,very good,"It was very informative. Covers very good points dealing with ""Egypt's Golden Empire."" All the major pharoahs are included in this DVD."
2,Poor audio and visual dustract,The material persented here would have been much better in an audio book format. The TV production is hard to watch as the same visuals are repeated. The musical score also repeats over and over. A dull series.
4,Great info!,Recently had a trip to Egypt just before the turmoil and this series did a great deal to suppliment my trip. Well done.
1,AppleTV to Vivitek,This device didn't do the trick in connected my AppleTV to my Vivitek projector. Had to return it. I ended up going HDMI with a device to handle the HDCP (copy protection).
5,Great sound protection and fit,"These earplugs are great. I wear them whenever motorcycling, and they're definitely an improvement over the generic earplugs you get at a supermarket. The sound protection is better and they're much more comfortable. The only downside is having to buy 200 or so pairs of earplugs when you only maybe need 5 pairs, but I guess it's always nice to stash a set in your car in case you go to a loud club or bar."
5,Excellent earplugs for many uses,"These Laser Lite earplugs arrived on time and in great shape. They come in their original manufactured packaging, which consists of a box full of 200 individually wrapped pairs. I first encountered these at work in our machine shop. I prefer these due to their thinner profile, making them easier to insert and shape. The earplugs expand nicely and work as advertised. I wouldn't use alone for weapon firing (and can't speak to their performance for it), but these earplugs have gotten use for: machine work, subway rides, one fire alarm, and three times for sleeping (they fall out at some point overnight for me). The bright colors are meant for workplace protection (easy to check compliance from afar). I'm not crazy about the color scheme for most of my preferred uses, but the feel and performance protection are the critical features, and they excel here."
5,Great for shooters,"I use these at an indoor range to still have ear protection in case the guy next to me unloads while I am adjusting my ear muffs. At an outdoor range, these work great by themselves. They are good quality, easy to insert, and will stay in comfortably for prolonged periods of time."
5,Perfect for sleeping,"I've used earplugs to sleep for several years, and these are by far the most comfortable. Other types have had too much pressure, which caused ear pain after wearing them for a couple of hours, but not these. I can wear these all night with no pain, and they stay comfortably in place too. Most of the time, I can use them 2-3 nights without any loss of function. The best earplugs I've found for sleeping!!"
3,Better than most,These earplugs are soft. I barely know they are in. But they don't keep out the snoring like I wanted. They work better than all the others I've tried. But I'm still looking for better.
5,"Great value, large quantity, soft comfort","Just moved into the downtown area of a major city that's very loud. I got these to sleep with and purchased them based other reviews.They are extremely comfortable and are fantastic for sleeping. So much so, I gave pairs to my girlfriend (who would definitely complain if they hurt) and she loves them.Can't beat this deal."
5,I love these ear plugs,"I love these ear plugs because they are easy to put in, and you don't hear a thing when wearing them. They are comfortable and light."
1,dissatisfied,"I am unhappy with the level of service I received on this purchase. I needed this product, and the estimated delivery date was unsatisfactory, but i accepted the term. Then the delivery date came and went. The product itself is fine, but I will think twice before using amazon.com again. I will say however, the CSR at amazon customer service was relatively helpful."
4,Work well for the most part,"These work well especially when freshly inserted. They block out sound better than most ear plugs I have tried and they are a really good buy. They are not designed for multi-night use. I find one night is the most I can get out of them. Some nights, when I woke up in the middle of the night, I had to insert a new pair because they were not blocking out sound as well as in the beginning of the night. I am trying to block out snoring. If I cannot go back to sleep and keep the same pair in, as the night wears on, the ear plugs wear out and sounds become louder. I was hoping they would be even more effective than they are, but I still find them to be a better alternative than the ones you can buy at the supermarket or drug store."
5,Great ear plugs for small female ear canals,Feel great and block out noise very well. I sleep with them in ...
3,Decent if you have small ears,These are decent earplugs and certainly colorful. You get a lot of them for a good price. However if you have large ear canals (like me) they do not expand enough to completely fill and block sound. So for me they are pretty much useless.
5,I love these,"Inexpensive and comfortable enough to wear all day at the range. These fit my ears, and my wifes much smaller ears with no trouble."
3,okay for other mild noises,"I got a box of 200 Pair Laser Lite Foam Ear Plugs for $17.77 which is cheaper than the in-store 50 Pair (average $10). They shrink easily when rolled with fingers and fit inside rather quickly. I use them for sleeping so I am always worried about discomfort and pain. They don't block out some very loud noises but are okay for other mild noises.They hurt a little in the morning because of the ""pressing"" against the pillow. I haven't used them that long so I hope they are better with time. Not as ""bulky"" as some other foam Ear Plugs.UPDATE: I've had them for a while and some are adequate, barely, for sleeping while others really hurt your ear tubes in the morning. In all, I would not recommend these for sleeping.I would recommend the purple ""Flents Quiet Time Soft Comfort Ear Plugs"" (NRR: 33) for sleeping.orFlents Quiet! Please - Foam Ear Plugs 10 Pr"
4,Prefer plugs with string connector,"I use these for sleeping. I am sensitive to sounds and my husband snores...so does our cat(!)...so these help me sleep by diminishing, but not eliminating, sound. Useful for travel too whether for sleeping in a plane or in a hotel.I mistakenly ordered the plugs without the string connecting them. Sometimes one plug falls out of my ear during the night and without the ""leash"", it essentially disappears, leaving me to rummage around for it or open another packet of plugs.I also apparently have small ear canals. These are the smallest plugs I've found and they still require a little effort to insert. Would love to see a manufacturer make earplugs for smaller ears."
4,Good plugs,The plugs work fine for us. We hand them out at to kids (and their parents) at our Rock n Romp events--live music shows put on in a kid-friendly environment.
5,It works excellent in noisy places,"Once you learn to place them correctly in the ear canal, they work perfect blocking noise, make sure you follow the instructions."
5,Howard Leight cordless laser lite earplugs,"For those of you that have sensitive ears, I highly recommend these earplugs. They are the most comfortable earplugs that I have ever used."
1,Broken! Lasted two days,Worked for a couple of days before something inside came loose. Now you can't see anything with them and unfortunately I threw the box away.
3,Not suitable for a young child,"After reading review I purchased for our Grandson but not suitable at his age. My husband was a little surprised that I even considered these binoculars. Maybe, we can use until he gets older and can focus."
4,light,Absolutely light binoculars. But I thought its mag can be set but actually it is fixed 25x10 no matter what you want to look at.
4,Good price,"Good price for the performance, and nice size to transport in saddle bag when I go horseback riding.Easy to adjust once you reed instructions"
4,great gift for kids!,"I bought my niece and nephew (ages 6 & 9) each a pair of these binoculars for xmas, along with the Bird Log Kids: A Kid's Journal to Record Their Birding Experience. I knew that they might not share my excitement about the birds, but binoculars are inherently cool!"
4,70's style Christian Rock,"By today's standards this kind of 70's style rock seems a bit out of place. But good music technique and a rock solid message comes through in the end. Nothing your teens might understand, but have come to enjoy this one."
2,Not much here for me.,"I love reading/watching anything to do with the paranormal especially haunted houses so I bought this VHS. While interesting, at best this is a one time watch. There is a really neat ""home made"" haunted house that you get to tour in the video though that looks like allot of fun.Final verdict: Check your local library and sign it out."
1,Not what I expected,"I bought this from ANTonline, it took forever, they canceled twice, and when it did arrive, it was shipped with a metal trowel in a too large of box with NO PACKING to reduce movement...this probably would have been alright with a normal mud pan, but this guy is SOOOOooo thin, well it was broken into 4 or so pieces with the edge of the knife still embedded into the side of one edge. IF your looking for a disposable pan, thats ULTRA LIGHT, and you can treat with KID GLOVES this might be the pan for you...I on the otherhand would not repurchase it again, or even from ANTONLINE again, because their service and shipping and packing and timeline totally suck. Hope Ive made this review abundantly clear."
2,Not advanced at all,"This book isn't bad, it's just not what the title claims. Advanced? Far from it! Don't buy this if you're expecting anything above low-intermediate level Japanese."
5,Exelent book for non-beginer,I just finished this book. If you already studied all the basics of most beginner courses and you seek for some advanced course this one is the right choice!.The book come with 2 sets of audio cassettes first set for study in car without a book and the second set should be studied with the book. The book itself organized in very convenient form. The 20 lessons come in Romaji with English translation and grammar remark at the first part of the book. At the second part one can find the same text in kana-kanji with a list of the new words and Kanji. Additionally there is English-Jap Jap-English dictionary with references to the lesson where the work was first introduced.For me this book was very helpful. I hope that in short future additional books for advanced Japanese learners will be published.
5,Indispensible tool for fighting depression,"This book is excellent. I love that author Joshsgard includes the evidence accrued from thousands of studies, but does so in an interesting and engaging way. You get all the scholarly background info, yet the book remains a great read. I am so encouraged by this book and feel much more equipped to conquer depression with as little prescription drug use as possible."
2,Overpriced,"Reasonable introduction to TRIZ, but is overpriced for only 44 pages. More examples of TRIZ in action are needed to understand how to use it."
2,Colors are labeled incorrectly,"I ordered the duvet cover in sienna, which appears to be red on the website. When it arrived, the label said sienna, but the cover is actually sage. It doesn't go with anything in my room. I went back to the website to check that I hadn't made a mistake and some of the other colors don't match the description either."
4,Great comfort and easy handling,"Blends well with any furniture (beds), great comfort and easy to maintain."
3,They're everywhere!,"I like the comforter, I really do. It's nice and soft. Full of puff. It warms without feeling heavy on your chest. However, the feathers are getting everywhere!! If you flip the blanket in the air to spread it across your bed.. tiny tiny little feathers fly around your room. They are all over the sheets. It's full of fluff and puff now.. but I can forsee it being flat and without feathers down the road."
1,what a mess!!,"If you try to wash this product be prepared for a real mess.first of all, it does feel nice, although difficult to cover your comforter.this product (no matter what you do) compresses into a ball, and doesn't wash well, or dry well.then trying to unravel this product will take you a really long time. very frustrating."
1,Worst kit,Seller metioned in his listing that the kit could be used to 1996-2006 models. But this is the biggest LIE. Rather only models 1996-2000 could be used.
3,delicious,"One for the girls! If you love Russell Wong then you won't be disappointed and the buddy theme with casper Van Diem & action scenes make this an easy movie to watch-with the ""Black sash"" tv-series on the way.. it good to see RW in a leading role again."
1,Bland and wooden,"This movie achieves nothing that couldn't be accomplished with a television episode a third of the length.The acting is horrible, probably a result of the cliched and totally unoriginal dialogue.The fight scenes are ok, but overall mediocre; look somewhere else!"
1,Pass on this one!,I received this as a gift. It is beautiful...BUTThe lid does not fit closely - so if you braise you have to constantly watch the level of your liquid.The bottom is not finished and scratched my counterThe lid handle broke off and the company will not replace the lid or help me find a glue to do a repair.It's pretty much useless now.
5,WOW!,"What a video! This Rolie Polie Olie is one of my favorites. It's bright and colorful but also teaches kids a great message about people being different but the same. We all need to teach our children about important issue such as people with handicaps, like Wheelie! He has a wheel instead of legs but is just like everybody else! What a wonderful lesson for kids to know and practice. I am so very impressed with Rolie Polie Olie. It's a very new, retro way for children to learn and have fun!"
1,Are you kidding?,"This book is full of articles taken from magazines, etc. and thrown into the book and then sold. Nothing new and nothing creative or revealing. One has to wonder if after compiling other people's work, did Roberts have to pay for using these articles? What a ripoff."
4,Definitely in the Top 10 soft-cores ever!,"This film is a ""can't miss"" for fans of the genre and well worth owning. In addition to the lovely Shauna O'Brien (looking much better here in her pre-implant days than she does now, by the way), the movie stars Griffin Drew and Lisa Boyle, two of the mainstays of erotic films. The plot (free spirit comes to live with family and opens up each family member sexually) has been done before, but never better!"
3,Fun erotica,"Friend of the family is the story of a beautiful woman named Elke, who while backpacking, is invited to stay with the stillman family (mom, dad, son and daughter). The plot is minimal but its erotica - so thats acceptable, Elke is gorgeous and its fun to watch her get involved with every member of the family."
4,Two of the hottest women in one great movie!,"This movie is amazingly hot for two reasons. Griffen Drew and Lisa Boyle. Griffen plays the Hot wife of the dad and Lisa plays the Naughty daughter. A mysteriously erotic woman (Shauna O'brien) comes to stay with a family in crisis and helps them the only way she knows how, by having sex with every one of them. She makes the wife feel sexy, helps the son be a stud and helps the naughty daughter establish self respect [she has a bad reputation around town]. This movie is not only hot but also has a message, sex makes every problem go away. This is a must see.As always,make sure you get the UNRATED version of this movie because the R-rated version has all the sex taken out.ALWAYS GET UNRATED!ALWAYS!!!"
2,Need to tell more info,They didn't say this movie was edited. I wouldn't have bought this movie if I new that. It was a rip off.
1,Kindle is not user friendly so do not buy Kindle version,"I'm not sure what the publisher was thinking when they made the Kindle version available. I have a Kindle $99 and this book is useless on the Kindle. For one thing, I can't play the games and activities on the Kindle at all. What is the point of buying a word puzzle game when you can't fill out the puzzle on your Kindle? I tried to print the pages where the games and activities were, there was no option to print either. Spent 30 minutes on the phone with Kindle customer service to finally realize the above so I returned the Kindle book and buy the actual book instead."
3,What happened?,"I have the original ROCKET vinyl album of I've got the Music In Me...I bought this CD for TWO SONGS and ONLY two songs...""Step by Step"" and ""You Need Help""...the second song is a different version than I am used to on vinyl. Maybe this is a British version of something, but it's very disappointing to me. Other than that, it's nice to have some Kiki on CD."
5,cant help,"I am searching for the music for this track too and have been for about 2 months, with no success"
1,24242 swiss army watch,i have no idea how this watch is. i payed for it on 12/19/06 today is 1/18/07 and i've never seen the watch.
4,Roy Stuart Vol 3,Such natural ConciSe bodies and French erotic orientation. Breathtaking!Plus the man has the imagination to have a few exemplary situations..
1,KIDZ BOP IS JUST DOWNRIGHT DISGUSTING!,"If you wanna know how i feel, look at the title. When I heard about this God awful CD on the TV, I thought it was completely stupid and it still is because these 7, 8, 9 year old kids are like re-creating songs that us (teenagers) love and making it worse...its just not right and i give this cd and all the other kidz bop cds two thumbs DOWN!"
2,It's O.K....just O.K.,"Some kids actually like this stuff. Some songs are ones I would be fine listening to (a.k.a. they haven't broken my ears.... yet). Others don't just plain stink, but they give the origional singer a bad name. Little kids may like the music, but if, like me, you are [...] and actually listen to the words, don't buy this. If you must hear this CD, Get it from the library instead."
1,Something Has Changed,"I'll start by saying that my two kids have enjoyed all the Kidz Bop Cds to this point, and they are daily play in our car. HOWEVER on the first play of Kidz Bop 4 my youngest made the comment that ""these aren't the Kidz Bop Kidz"" on a closer listen I do have to agree with her. I think they are different people doing this record. it sounds thrown together and cheap. well at least my kids still enjoy the other kidz bop stuff! they refuse to listen to this one now."
1,HOW CAN YOU LISTEN TO THIS!? IT IS PROBABALY A RISK TO YOUR HEALTH!,"i swear they make fun of some of the best bands ever! in 8, they have greenday and weezer!"
1,What a Waste of Money,"For one thing, whoever came up with ingenuis idea of having random kids and adults singing songs that by themselves, usually aren't that bad, must have known how much little kids would enjoy it. Another is that most of these songs have little or no change to the lyrics, so the parents should just go buy the Now CDs because they edit language. Plus, then you wouldn't wnat to crash your car into a pole while listening to this."
1,Health Risk,"I strongly advise all consumers to avoid this product. It is a danger to you and those who are closest to you. Paying money for a CD of such low calibur as this one is a serious risk to your physical and mental health. Listening to it could cause your ear drums to implode upon themselves and the realization that it cost you money could drive you to insanity, often resulting in suicidal thoughts. Please heed my warning: Stay away from Kidz Bop 4, its predecessors and any future Kidz Bops. You will be glad you did.Sincerely,The Surgeon General"
1,Slot Game,this game is nothing like what i thought it would be.it is really not very realilistic.i don't like it and don't play it.[...]i would NOT recomment it to anyone.
1,BROKEN into a 1000 pieces,"I rated this product a 1 star, because I was never able to see the product as it was sent to me BROKEN.Amazon has got to get with the packaging program. I was handed the box by the delivery guy and I heard tiny shards of glass rattling around. I opened the box to discover PATHETIC PACKAGING, no peanuts or anything just a broken crystal decanter inside of a box. HOW STUPID. The main box didn't even have glass or fragile written on it-so I'm sure the delivery guys were anything but careful with it (for all they could tell it was a box of fluffy sheets.)However, Amazon says they will pay for my return shipping and replacement. We'll see how this goes. I'll keep you posted when I receive the second item. Wish Amazon luck."
1,Avoid Like the Plague!,"I was completely dissatisfied with this worthless product. I bought the decanter to hold mouthwash for my bathroom after seeing the idea in a magazine. This decanter is beautiful and arrived on time. I filled it with mouthwash and put it in my bathroom. When I returned a few minutes later, it was sitting in a puddle of mouthwash! I took a photo of the spill and will try to post it. It turns out there's a leak along the seam in the little circle cutout in the center. Absolutely worthless - I'll never buy another Lenox product, and certainly advise everyone reading this to avoid this particular product at least."
1,Arrived Broken,"Amazon shipped this item to me with no protective packaging, and it arrived completely shattered. I recommend purchasing a decanter elsewhere."
2,Lenox Tuscany Decanter,The cap on the decanter does not seat properly. It wobbles and sits crooked. The design of the body of the decanter is wonderful. It's the cap that destroys the beauty of this. It just looks CHEAP.
2,Theresa,"I totally agree with the loose stopper. I am very disappointed that lenox would make a product with this default. I am a lenox LOVER, and usually lenox products are flawless. This stopper is actually very irritating. On a good note, the decanter itself is lightweight because it is made from glass and not crystal. The look is stylish, so if you have company, just leave the stopper off because people will think you purchased a faulty item."
1,Arrived in Pieces,"I did not realize that when I ordered this product ""assembly"" would be required. It arrived in many pieces. Needless to say it was useless. I did not even need to open the box to know that it was broken. You could hear it when you picked up the shipping box."
4,Unique design,"I bought it for a gift for a friend, but I loved the design of the decanter.. I wasnt even aware that Lenox was so popular until I showed my purchased to someone at work, apparently the price was even a steal. I am hoping that the one I did buy it for LOVES it as much as I do!"
4,"Nice, but don't buy for the alarm","This is a nice watch, attractive and comfortable to wear. I especially like being able to see the hands at night. However, the alarm only works 15% of the time. Setting the time, date and alarm is not as easy as it sounds, because you have to unscrew and pull the stem out the right number of stops, which are not clearly defined. Was that one stop, or two? You can't tell until the wrong thing starts spinning. Then, once you set the alarm, there is another stem that has to be pulled out. But, that one pushes back in very easily in the normal course of wearing the watch. Most of the time, the alarm does not work for me. Even if I do not accidentally push the alarm stem back in, thus turning off the alarm, the alarm still does not sound! There may be an AM/PM difference, but I haven't figured it out. If you're buying this watch to use the alarm on a daily basis as I was, keep looking. Otherwise, it's a perfectly fine knock around watch which can dress up or dress down."
4,A comprehensive study of diseases and their (mis) diagnosis,"This book compiles a GREAT deal of useful information about plant pathology. It covers, as any good work about plant disease should, fertilization, nutritional deficiencies, and environmental factors such as drought, freezing, lightning, air pollution, water contamination etc. before attempting to fix the problem, the work stresses the causal effects and ,similarly, the visual pitfalls that may provide evidence of an unseen insect symptom (galling, nematodes, etc.) The work was written mainly for the temperate zone, but using it in my home sub-tropics was an eye-opener! Reccomended reading for Horticulturalists in the upper echelon, or for Pathologists as a reference, and a reminder to look to the outlying areas for an answer, It's always there!"
5,Some of the best praise music in my collection,I can't recommend this highly enough. The music is terrific. It just helps me get in a state of mind that is thankful for the love and friendship we have with Jesus Christ. This music brought healing during a difficult period. Helped to see and embrace the freedom I have in Christ Jesus.
5,magic shampoo,"I'm Asian Woman 43,I start to shed so much hair,I'm having bold spot,this shampoo are the most best hair shampoo i ever use .it works wonder,i was shock to find out how wonderful it works on me,i dont need conditioner.I highly highly recom.this product will stay with me forever.thank you,Queen helene."
2,poorly made,"The dart board itself is fine. Although, the solid pine cabinet looks good on the site, the construction of it is of very poor quality. The back is akin to a a thick particle board, but isn't, and is stapled to the sides of the the cabinet. The top has pulled completely away from the cabinet. The box that the dart board was mailed in was sturdy and undamaged. I hadn't opened it to inspect the purchase until it was opened by my husband on Christmas morning. I didn't see any reason to, as the box was completely intact. I was somewhat surprised to see that the dart board was not secured in anyway, by either some padding or tape to keep the doors from pulling away from the base of the cabinet. You guessed it. One side had completely pulled away from the base, hence the screws were stripped from one of the hinges. All in all, I would probably not recommend the product."
3,Get what you pay for,"super cheap wood on this and didn't come with anything to hang to the wall, I just used some heavy duty screws and it hung well onto the wall."
3,Warm story with memories,"I'm not quite sure how this movie would do with young people today. I saw it once nearly 30 years ago and I loved it and felt the need to buy it just to see it again when it was released on DVD. I found myself remembering certain parts of it and images in an uncanny sort of way.The story is a bit simplistic, but the scenery is interesting and there is a surreal little dream sequence which is great, though not brilliant. Overall, I got out of it what I wanted and would gladly share this movie with other young people...though I'm not sure how much of their attention it would hold in this modern age...?"
4,Hans Brinker..... a classic!,"I love this movie! I remember being very young (early seventies) and going to see this movie with my whole 2nd grade class. And now to be able to see this again after so many years, bring brings back great momories. Oh sure, the acting is not academy award worthy, but it's message and it's feel-good ending is what this movie is all about. And watching this also reminds me of Sunday nights in front of the television watching Disney movies.... So order this movie, sit back an let yourself remember when life was innocent."
3,pretty good,the album was pretty good but the title cut is still the jam. i groove to the re-mix to this day and central line had some real grooves on this album. good cook out and party type jams that still make you move.pretty good overall set.
1,Aberrantly poor,"Terribly dated first attempt at speculative fiction by a soon-to-be-great writer... it bears his name but not the quality of Delany's later work. One can only wonder why it is again in print. I can't supply any answers to that but I can say that the absurd writing here borders on absurdism without quite breaking through, even though the extreme hokey-ness of the prose wedded to the writer's modernist aspirations achieves a veritable surrealism that will literally force you again and again to wonder ""did I just read that?"""
4,Techno at it's best,"The member's of mayday are a great techno group. They have fast moving songs and slower songs and this song called ""datapop"" is a very uptempo song that get's you wanting to move! If you like trance techno music then you need this album in your collection to get the party started right!"
5,Mind Opening,This book exposes the world for what it is ass backwards and totally deranged. It leaves no hope for mankind outside of submission to Jesus Christ and his redemptive blood. But you will not find many who will admit this because deception runs so deep in todays society that no one dare expose it...except this author!
4,The Truth,"Glass Backwards is a very plausible reality, if it is not already true. People have this belief that God is like them, but God is all knowing and all power, God is not like us. Glass Backwards makes this very clear. This book could be a 5 star book, but it is different and takes some real intelligence to comprehend all of the subject matter, thus it is not for everyone. One has to have the ability to see between the lines and be conceptual in thought. At superficial glance it can be misunderstood, one has to put some thought into the mysticism and the plays on God and reality. This is a very real idea."
2,Sin as Sexy Grease in an Evil Machine,"Glass Backwards enjoys the rhetoric so often found in autopsies of the Profane ( satan) at work in the ordinary.The book , while derivative of others in this genre' , has to it's credit , the unique perspective of satan at work in *the industry*.And for those who are interested in how satan may be seen in sexed-up Hollywood , this tome delivers.Unlike other reviews here- I do believe that it is possible fora Christian to write a searing reflection of evil up close and personal ; both reviling and compelling - without gratuity.I am un convinced , however, that whatever value may be found within Glass Backwards earns the keep required of the reader.Daniels has promise as a writer. I enjoyed his other book Lamb, more.Tho it too was reminiscient of similar Armageddon works-Steven Kings *THE STAND* comes to mind.Glass Backwards may offend . It may inform.All in grand emotive style."
1,Nice to have by the toilet when your low on wipe!!!,"This Clown is a pisswilly want to be cult leader,He change's His new age belief's daily .This book is right up there with Martha StewartsHow To Make a better short stop option on the market."
3,Fun to solve; overkill for Math Level 1,"I almost entirely agree with ""Concerned Consumer"". I tutor for the SAT and take tests every year to stay abreast. I also buy most of the books on SAT II Math (now SAT Subject Test in Math) to see if they have material I could utilize in my teaching. I bought all of Meylani books, except for his latest one (""Complete Prep ..."").""Math IC Test Booklets"" are not a bad supplement for prepping for Math Level 2, provided you have a math expert helping you to deal with mistakes, decipher hasty handwritten solutions posted online (good idea, bad implementation), and weed out questions that never happened and never will on real Math Level 1.Make sure you check/use other SAT books and practice (a lot!), taking timed really realistic tests, and some harder ones, like Barron's."
4,I wish there were the solutions,"Although your questions are excellent and they deserve 5 stars, I am giving you 4 because I wish you had the solutions along with the answers. It was a great prep for me but I had to look up the internet to get the solutions. Nevertheless I am quite satisfied by your books."
4,A great book to dip into.,"I didn't know all the songs that he writes about, but in a way it doesn't matter as there are some great insights and riffs on songs and the meaning they accumulate in a person's life. It made we want to search out the songs and listen to them for myself.As with other Hornby books, the readability of his prose belies the complexity and layering of ideas. There is a compelling momentum that builds within each piece. Each ""little"" essay is self contained insight into the music and the man. It has the flavour of an auto-biography told through his relationship with music. It takes great skill to write like that.It's a fantastic book to dip into, but the pre-condition is you need a similar obsessive sensibility to music, or more properly popular music, as Hornby has. If you think of music as background, this book is not for you. But if you still remember the first record you bought or concert you went to, where you were, how old you were than you will relate to this book."
