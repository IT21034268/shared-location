5,Comedy Could Not Better Be!,"Danny Kaye stars in this uproarious, hilarious, witty, timeless comedy about a Jester embroiled in affairs of state, romance, and laughter in a medieval kingdom.This is a film to watch over and over again!""Life could not better be, better be, better be..."""
5,Classic comedy,"One of the best films Danny Kaye appeared in, and backed by an equally fantastic cast in top form: basil rathbone, angela lansbury, etc. Great comedy, great musical numbers, and a healthy dose of action. This movie is seriously funny."
1,Broke after the first ride.,These rollers broke on the first ride. The rear roller would continue to slip against the frame after the initial break. I'm 170 lbs cyclist and did not these hard. I could not recommend them.
5,The BEST prog with a pop edge!,"The Morse bros. and company continue to grow and grow musically, with this easily the strongest material to date. Their last effort ""Kindness Of Strangers"" (still an unbelievable disc) was strong but seemed to lack the direction that ""Day For Night"" displays. Awesome vocals, awesome musicianship, awesome arrangements,......AWESOME! If you consider yourself in the least to be a fan of the modern prog movement DON'T let this one pass you by. PROG RULES!!!!!"
3,Mediocre At Best,"It seems as though the original release of Day For Night attracted reviews that ranged from rapturous to almost non-committal. I have been a Spock's Beard fan for nearly four years now and based on my experience with the music of both Spock's Beard and the solo output of original bandleader Neal Morse, I would have to say that Day For Night rates as mediocre at best.That is not to say that the CD is not good, it has grown on me tremendously. Its just that when measured against such giants as Snow and The Light, its significance pales. The chief fault is that nothing stands out. There is the typical pop/prog mix for which the band is famous but there is not a single song that is truly memorable.So if you are a fan of Spock's Beard and have not yet heard this, by all means get this Special Edition. It is worth a couple extra bucks. But don't expect to be dazzled, just merely satisfied."
2,Spock's mistake! What happened?,"Spock's Beard is a great band ,talented musicians and great music but something went wrong here,,a terrible experiment or something but man what a disappointment! Overall poor songs,no powerful tunes,no punch,no great lyrics,just downright bad. Hate to say it but the guys messed up on this one!dont waste your money on this one! Very poor effort!"
4,A quick review,"I'll just make a quick review of this album. The first times I played it I was disappointed. It wasn't much else than the title track ""Day for Night"" that sounded like I'm used to from their other albums ""Beware of Darkness"" and ""V"". However, after a week I got into it, and now I really like it. Still, I can't give it more than 4 stars, not very much that it's bad, more because their other records are better.This album is slightly different from the other and I wouldn't recommend you to start off with record. As I mentioned earlier, BoD and V are the best so far."
4,See! The good DO last!,"Spock progresses (sic). Their ""prog"" influences are very much evident, however, this album is a bit more ""commercially accessible"" than the last. (No I'm not in advertising). Definitely a band to watch out for...any moment now..."
2,Not To My Liking,"Another highly-praised album that I cannot find myself enjoying. Too many different sounds and influences on this album. Very confusing and jumbled musical ideas. One song is pure pop, another is pure 70's style prog, another sounds alternative, and then switches to a long instrumental break that sounds like jazz. Too weird for my ears."
2,A Rarely Missed Target,"I won't rehash information found in other reviews of this album. I've recently bought a number of Spock's Beard albums and am shocked at not only their sheer talent, but their ability to convey it in such pleasurable ways. It's all a question of style, and Spock's Beard has it...but just not on this CD. This one is a departure from their normal format, the songs being much shorter and the overall demeanor much 'harder'. The hardness comes from guitar distortions liberally distributed in too many tracks, and although I can normally deal with hard (prog) rock just fine, I find this release too obnoxious on balance. Unless you are distortion freak, stick with many of the other SB albums, many of them are top notch."
3,Bad singing,The music in this cd is great some of it amazing but I hated the singing. It sounds to much like N'Sync. So without the singing its great sounds alot like dream theater. so u like dream theater get this cd
4,"Not Their Best, But Better Than Most of the Rest","Different from previous Beard albums in it's more standard-issue songlengths, Day For Night is nevertheless a fine album. Perhaps the most melodic of all their releases, it also features some of Neil Morse's finest singing, and large contributions from Al Morse on guitar, with the usual keyboard and drum mastery. The best cuts include the opening title track, with it's revolving bassline and keyboards. Other winners include Crack The Big Sky, The Gypsy, and The Healing Colors of Sound and My Shoes pieces. The ""Revisited"" My Shoes track features perhaps Al Morse's greatest ever guitar solo. As I mentioned before, Neil's vocals are above even his own high standard on this album, as tracks like Lay It Down, The Distance To The Sun, and others prove. Although not their best album (which is probably their latest release, V) this belongs in the collection of any Spock's Beard or neo-prog fan."
5,The best prog band in the world outdoes itself,"Spock's Beard is the best progressive rock band to burst onto the schene since the music's heyday in the 70s. With Day For Night, the band has made its most fully realized album yet. Incredible musicianship and songwriting meld seamlessly into a listening experience unlike any other in contemporary rock. If you enjoy beautiful melody, virtuoso technical mastery of instruments, amazing vocal harmonies, thought-provoking lyrics, and great pop mixed in with the intricate musical passages characteristic of prog, Spock's Beard is a must-have, and so is DFN, their best album to date."
3,"Aptly Named, Day for Night has Ups for Downs","""Day for Night"" has individule tracks that are fantastic, but Prog Rock is all about listening to an Album, not radio friendly cuts. And that is where this CD falls short. I was an SB fan before buying this CD, I still consider ""V"" to be their absolute best, their new self titled CD 2nd ""Spock's Beard"", and ""The Kindness of Strangers"" 3rd. This is a good disc, but below SB's proven ability. It's a roller coaster of good to mediocre music, and thus very aptly named. At points I became board and stopped listening, the lyrics were a little simplistic. I would buy it again, but only after owning the others first."
3,"Some good, some bad","I agree with many reviewer, this album is under what the band has achieved in the past. The album contains great tracks but also really poor ones, something that you didn't find in ""The Light"" or ""Beware of darkness"" The poor numbers here are ""Crack the big sky"", ""The Gypsy"", ""Can't get it wrong"" (very poor pop ballad with bad vocals)The highlight is the last six songs, which should be just one epic...why did they divided this one? Maybe because this is simply a collage, if it is, I would have cut ""The healing colors of sounds part 2"" because it doens't fit in the whole sequence. The other good songs are the opening track ""Day for night"" and the following one ""Gibberish"" and finally ""The distance to the sun"" Spock's Beard can do better than this...and they will."
1,"Concept is interesting but, doesn't amount to much...","It seems that Korine has just decided to make his script as controversial as possible so that it would at least allow him some publicity for a film that probably would have otherwise sunk without trace. Being a small independent movie, it suffers the effects of such a budget; bad sound, camerawork and even actors (apart from Sevigny). Unlike many other films that are similar in content and subject matter, Clark's direction doesn't raise it above standards. Boys Don't Cry is a classic example of an 'indie' film that has risen above prejudices concerning independent films due to Peirce's sharp direction and haunting photography."
2,I agree with Nik,"This movie got all its attention simply because of the shocking way these kids act. Although I did not grow up in a big city I knew kids like the ones portrayed and found them just as much a waste of life then as the kids in the movie now.Some of the acting wasn't bad, in particular the actress portraying Jenny, the girl who discovers she has aids after only only having sex with one boy. However, I was just plan bored and to me, thats the worst sin a movie can commit; boredom."
3,The kids aren't all right,"'Kids' is perhaps one of the most unsettling films ever made. It's disgusting and crude but compelling and relevant. I only watched the film one time when I was sixteen, and it literally scared me, and I'm not sure if I can ever do it again, which just means it works. The story follows a clan of NYC youths through 24 hours of hell that is their adolescent lives. Crisp, stylish camera work makes it feel like a documentary. We learn a young women is one of many that is infected with AIDS. She turns to being innocent and partying with friends to forget her troubles. The film ends in a disturbing manner and shows the results of ignorance to the reality of our world. Hopefully this film can stand as a example of what not to do. It hurts to watch but I recommend it. 'Kids' is a brutal but very effective film."
3,"Modern-day, co-ed ""Lord of the Flies.""","And William Golding thought adults had to be -physically- absent for juvenile behavior to get this bad! How quaint...As a Gen-Xer, I think too many parents put the pursuit of money ahead of actually spending time with their children, being involved in their lives, and doing the grunt work of raising them. ""Kids"" shows the consequences of this cultural shift which began in the highly overrated 1960s. Thanks a lot, hippies! I've been to countries where parenting and family is more valued, and the vast majority of teens live fuller lives because the extended family acts as a built-in support network for them. Compare that to the hollow cheap-thrill seeking of the teens in this movie and I have to admit that family values really do make a difference."
4,"The real thing, a day in the life of an average teen.","PARENTS KEEP YOUR EYE'S OPEN!! You may not like the truth, but this is what your son/daughter's life might be like. Even though it's tough to soak in, it's happening, and there's NO way to avoid it. This movie is has an excellent way of showing all the posibilities. You CAN'T ignore it. Although it may be very graphic, it's a lesson well tought that all people need to accept into their society and lives, sex can't be hidden!!"
3,An Artist documents America The Doomed,"KidsSexDope. . .repeatKidsLiesTheft. . .repeatKidsRapeBrutality. . .repeatThis is today's American youth? We're doomed; this is moral implosion.My generation, and we weren't particularly thoughtful or polite, used words such as: peace, please, love, thank-you, welcome. . .I don't think I heard any or those words here. (Sorry, ""love"" is used in the film, but only as a personal lubricant.)These KIDS are subhuman. They beat; they rob; one--and this is his goal?--tries to claim two virgins in one day.Quit moralizing, you might say; this is only a movie and these are only actors. But--really--this is a documentary. In the ending credits, Clark claims credit for ""original story"". But there is no story here; it's just kids let loose. (Sorry: 21st-century American kids let loose.)About as depressing a movie as I have ever seen."
4,Weird,"When i saw this movie, it was really weird 'cos most of that stuff is the stuff me and my friends get up2 when we all together......the last generation should watch this movie to see what it is really like for teens these days"
2,A bit close to reality....but come on!! hold your breaks,"The story somehow is quite interesting, and it does highlights several issues that people should be aware of, but for god's sake, it's exceeds the reality, i know there are kids like that and even more, i was one of them once, but the way it was let go was quite exadurated, specialy the last 15 minutes or so.Anyway worth watching, i'm giving it three stars simply for the idea and the awarness it could cause (somehow), however the quality of picture (dvd) is not that good (2 out of five) sound is terrible."
3,High shock value; Low moral value,"A well devoloped but irresponsible movie, I was angry when I first watched it. I couldn't believe what these 'kids' were doing and the attitude they had about it. Whether it was teen sex, alcohol, drugs, lying to parents, or viciously ganging up and beating on people, the kids had a no-consequence attitude that scared me. The documentary/home movie style filming gave it an absolute realism to the characters.It's not what I consider educational, and no child should ever watch it (I saw it at age 21). To its credit, however, it intrigued me so much I ended up watching it again. I admit that it keeps your attention like almost nothing else, and that's why the three stars. One star for the message it sends (unless you're mature enough to see through the superficial behavior by the end). Five stars because of its originality and ability to hold your attention in disbelief of what you're watching."
3,Sad but True,"This movie manages everything it sets out to do...showing just how the teen generations have degraded into mindless hedonistic animals totally unaware of the dangers of the world around them...shocking and disturbing from beinging to end.I saw this movie when it first priemered on TV and was horrified not so much on how graphic it was, but how true to life it was and just how much of a accurate insight into the teen generation its was.although this is a great slice of realism, its hard to stomcah as anything other that a study of the teen generation."
5,This movie is real life...,"First of all, i like to state that Larry clark's ""kids"" is more like vision of how real kids act who barely enter 10th grade act nowdays and when i seen it? I was suprised that it was made few years ago because it seems like it was made just today because thats how kids realy act...Specialy the white boys who act black its so true and so real i relay ddi like it for that part.. Watch it! It's f*cking sick..."
1,Horrible,"I am only 14 years old. I would think that a movie like this would have an impact on someone my age. It didnt. It nearly put me to sleep. It was the biggest waste of money in my life. I just bought it today and am throwing it away today also.All this movie offers is an inaccurate portrait or teens, and the story of a group of moron teenagers who thinks its cool to be going around drinking, smoking, engaging in brutal fights with people and other acts of vandalism, having sex with girls between the age of 12 and 15, and stealing from their parents.This was a huge waste of an hour and a half. I only gave this movie 1 star because amazon doesn't allow me to give it 0.If you are looking for a movie that offers the story of troubled teens, and is GOOD, Thirteen is the movie you wanna watch."
1,I hate wiggers,"The sex, drugs, violence and constant marijuana usage didn't get to me. What got to me where the unbelievably annoying accents of white kids trying to be black. Not to mention the fact that Telly is a ratfaced wigger who thinks he's a pimp.Check out that complection in the mirror before you bust out with ebonics, ya'll."
1,Kids DVD,I hate this DVD simply because it didn't work in any type of DVD player I tried to play it in. So could you please send me another one.
2,Eww,"I have never seen this movie and never will. First of all, i ain't aloud(I'm 11). Second, based on other reviews this movie sounds so disturbing. kids as young as 10 smoking illegally, drinking, swearing, having sex, beating, and getting and delivering sexually transmitted diseases just AIN'T right! i mean there are some things i do and can't stop because of habits(swearing) and it is not so bad but this kinda stuff is WRONG!there are some things i will encounter in my life that are wrong and i won't do like the kids in this movie that I'm reading about in reviews. this movie is a true wake up call."
4,GOOD MOVIE NEW YORK CITY SUCKS !,"THIS MOVIE MAKES YOU THINK ABOUT YOUR LIFE AND HEALTH.I RECOMMEND THIS MOVIE TO YOUNGER KIDS,AS YOUNG AS 15.THIS MOVIE WAS RIGHT ABOUT ONE THING NEW YORK CITY IS A NASTY PLACE TO LIVE AND VISIT.I RECOMMEND YOU TO NEVER GO TO NEW YORK."
2,"Yuck, Yuck, Yuck","I hated this movie. SO unrealistic. Sure, maybe there are some little freaks running around raping and drinking and beating. But I AM a teenager in a city. NOBODY acts like this!What the hell is the point of this movie? To scare the crap out of parents?Also, the rape scene was vile. At first I respected the director for showing it and not shying away. A FULL MINUTE LATER, I started feeling awkward and uncomfortable. It wasn't even artistic, it was just disgusting and truly disturbing."
3,Tsk-tsk,"""Kids"" made out when I was nine. Then, I didn't want to see it nor did I know anything about it. My parents saw it in 1999, and their sheer reluctance to me watching the film told me that it was NOT for kids. I finally saw it and was I ever shocked! This is not a 'brutally honest' look into kids today. Real kids are not as stupid as these were. The girls that Telly deflowered were pathetic and the only sane character in the entire film was the taxi driver. As a virgin myself, I would never want to lose my virginity to someone as UGLY as Telly. And besides, Darcy knew Telly for like, what...two hours before they had sex? Who is really this stupid? I'm not saying it's a bad movie, but it's NOT real. Probably one out of every five hundred kids are really like these idiots. All I saw in the movie were carnal boys and spineless girls. One life lesson for all girls: ""IF A GUY TELLS YOU EVERYTHING YOU WANT TO HEAR, HE'S FULL OF IT""."
5,"If you don' see the brilliance in this film, you're crazy","As I said above, if you don't see the brilliance of this film, you're crazy. This film is NOT at all influencing teens to act the way the teens in the movie did. This movie is a wake up call to parents. The last line in the movie is a teen saying ""What the hell happened?"" Think about that as you watch this movie, I guarantee that you'll love it."
2,"Review of the disc, not the film","First off, this version is cut. I might be wrong with the numbers, but this DVD is 91 minutes long, while the complete film is 102 minutes long. So, there. Also, it's non-anamorphic, and has no extras. This is the second DVD release of ""Kids,"" but so far the company has failed to release a great film in any kind of a deserving package.Here's hoping for a Special Edition, with a commentary, anamorphic transfer, and everything else. Oh, and also the complete film."
3,what's up with this?,"OK, I am a sophomore in college. I have seen this movie several times and found it to be very interesting and watchable. It is not a very accurate depiction of ""average"" 13 and 14 year olds. Of course we all know people who have sex, drink, or do drugs at that age, but they definately do not make up a majority. My main bone to pick here is this. What the hell are all these 13 year old girls doing writing reviews for this movie. I mean, do they not even check IDs at movies anymore? Although i don't neccessarily believe in the ratings system, it is there for a reason. To read some of the reviews, you would think this was some backstreet nysync movie, not a serious social commentary."
2,Surprised at the quality of the copy,"Many other people have commented on the content of ""Kids"" and I won't here. I was surprised that the VHS format was at EP (slow) speed (thus reducing the video quality) and the cellophane wraping seemed flimsy. I bought the copy from Amazon. Maybe I should have expected this because it was so inexpensive.I did not notice any defects in the actual video, however.Bill"
4,Not to bad!,This movie wasn't to bad it actually had a pretty good story line. It's a little scary because this is reality of what some teenagers face today. I wasn't disappointed with this at all.
5,KIDS,"I first heard about the movie ""KIDS"" from the Logo Channel in kck and wanted to see it so i could see just how others viewed teens and the ever so frightening subject of teen sexuality and the scare of contracting some sexually transmitted diseases. It was very interesting to see how they actually picked up on how the young kids of today really act in big cities, and most likely in small towns also. Makes one want to be able to keep a watchful eye on their children alot more. I thought it was a good movie and very informative to parents."
4,where are you,this what happens when kids have no parents to raise them . all parents should see this if they have the guts
3,Highly Disturbing,"Sorry to offend all of you who adore this movie for it's ""reality"" but this is NOT what teenagers go through in America. Your average teenager doesn't go through any of this, (and for those teenagers who say that this is the way it is, you're lying! Wake up, you do not live like this!) This is a portrayal of how teenagers with antisocial personality disorder with psychotic tendencies (in other words, f*cked up teenagers) live. Wake up and smell the coffee! You don't live like this!This movie is disturbing on many fronts. There are children like this (you aren't one of them!) and there are adults that simply don't give a damn. This movie is very important because it gives those without the opporitunity to witness these things to see how bad some of our children have become. These are VERY extreme cases, but at the same time, we are all somewhere on that slippery slope towards this hedonistic and destructive existence."
3,Better when I was younger,"I watched this many years ago, and at the time it was really good because that's how I was as a youth. You also thought it was a real documentary which made it more disturbing. Now that I watched it as an adult, it's pretty sick and twisted and you realize now that it was acted out. There really isn't much of a plot other than the one storyline. It's kind of all over the place with a overemphazising of how young teens act. I would rather have rented but it's very hard to find."
4,don't listen to those people!,"look were the other reviewers are coming from they don't know what inner city life is like if you want to know, watch the film it's true stories of big city life."
3,good and bad,"this movie touches you on so many different levels its amazing. As far as the movie itself,the director,larry clark does a great job.He gives us an intense and crazy look at a day in the life of a teen. The problem with this movie is that not all teens are like the ones depicted in this film.These ones isolate themselves in a world of robbery,sex,drugs,and parties,that by halfway through the movie your nauseated. I myself am 15 years old. I do no some kids like these but not all kids are like this. At the end of the film he leaves you with the sense that theres no hope. Like everything is going to hell and theres not a thing we can do about it. It is extremely depressing and intense. The movie is frank and to the point. It is a very depressing film,but good nonetheless."
2,Truthful and Disgusting,"I agree...this does happen all over the world...there are kids out there who live and act like the very kids in this movie. But just because it is a reality does not mean that I have to like the movie, and I definitely do not. My friends and I did some crazy, stupid things in high school, but we did not behave this way. My goal as a parent is to raise my son in a caring, loving, yet disciplining environment where he can make his own decisions but understand the consequences of his own actions. Hopefully (without sounding naive) I can give my son the tools to make good decisions so he does not find himself in these same situations."
5,Life in the big city?,"This would have to be Larry Clark's best movie. His other movies are very good too (Bully, Gummo), but this one stands out a little bit more. In most movies, the characters are people you can either (a.) relate to in some way, (b.) sympathize with, (c.) feel absolute pity for, or (d.) absolutly loathe. I think in this movie, you can sometimes feel all those emotions at different parts of the movie. But in the final analysis, you tend to think that these ""kids"" are just super predators headed to a life of crime.... But the beauty of this movie are the small scenes of urban decay and deliberate dialogue. Observing them interact is very watchable, and you can also pick out scenes where they behave in a very normal fashion. Their brutal, conniving, sexual way of living life in NYC may or may not be typical for kids their age, but in this story, at least some of them will pay for their ignorance and apathy with the ultimate price: their life."
3,person from ohio says it all,the voicer from dayton ohio said it all. This is the most true description of this film and the youths involved. I need not say anything more.
5,excelent movie,"I believe that this movie portrays real life adolescence, and they're views on life. Many people believe that the video is a fallacy, however from the perspective of a teen growing up on the streets, the movie couldn't have hit the nail any closer to the head. Unfortunately teens believe they're invincible and will go throughout life bouncing from wall to wall until they crash. I believe that this may as well be a documentary on the street punk/skater teenage subculture."
3,Casper?!?,"Casper the dopest ghost! The dopest ghost in town! Casper! Casper? Oh, Casper! No Casper! Don't do it Casper! you were the only enjoyable character left in the film, please . . . don't . . . casper the dopest ghost, the dopest ghost in town."
2,"When you are young not much matters, when you find something you like that's all you got.","Another gritty and realistic film from the director of ""Gummo"" and ""Bully,"" ""Kids"" starts where ""Gummo"" left off and further explores the nihilistic lives of modern urban adolescents who are desperately seeking to find a purpose in lives that are dominated by neglectful parents, broken homes, dysfunctional families, and the dehumanizing brutality of urban existence. ""Kids"" presents in all its ugliness the degeneration of our society and the way our teenagers attempt to deal with it through the use of drugs and promiscuous and meaningless sex.Although ""Kids"" is presented as realistically as possible it lacked the weirdness that made ""Gummo"" a great movie. ""Kids"" was also supposed to contain scenes of profound violence and brutality when the only scene that was violent was when a black kid got pummeled by a group of kids. Hardly shocking and hardly worth watching again, ""Kids"" falls short of my expections."
2,The Soundtrack Was Better!,"I bought the soundtrack to this film, and believe me, you're better off doing just that and avoiding the film altogether.Jesus, people were up in arms about ""Rebel Without A Cause"" when it first came out-I loved that movie, but turned off ""Kids"" right in the scene where Casper is raping Jennie! I just couldn't take it!Like one reviewer said, I am soooo blessed this was not my reality as a teen, but I know so many of my counterparts growing up weren't so lucky. That's where having hard-as-nails parents and personal moral values come in!"
2,Ugly Movie,"People who claim they ""loved"" this gratuitous violence and debauchery-filled movie need to get a life and learn what a great movie is. There is nothing redeeming or ""important"" about this movie. It's just ugly."
2,Perfect acting! but...,"This movie is very interesting because it shows the garbage of society and how the teenagers are thinking that doing bad things like using drugs, beatting people or making sex with virgin womens are the coolest things in this world.Here are my opinions:Good things:1- A very WELL-MADE storyline.2- Perfect acting (it deserve the Oscar)3- Good cinematoghraphic for a ""indi"" film.4- Cool music.Bad things:1- EXTREMLY disgusting conversations.2- Little kids smoking grass.3- It doens't have a clear message against the drugs like in Requiem for a Dream.4- The movie says that using drugs is a very cool and funny thing to do, it also says that no matter the consencuenses of making sex without protection is still a cool thing because is the way to be more ""MACHO"".5- Dissappointing and incomplete ending.Note: Is worth to watch this film at least once, but if you think that being a junkie is good then just buy it! Adios...."
2,Perhaps one of the most depressing films you'll ever see...,"Ive always said that I have yet to see a horror film as scary as real life. This film shows a documentary, brutal and hard look at real life for teens. This horrific look at life film deals with drug abuse, sex, aids and some violent aspects such as a scene where a gang of lads beat up a skateboarder in Central Park. All the characters are unlikable and the movie makes you feel empty and sad, as this stuff really happens in life. In particular theres a scene where a group of boys on a couch are all sharing a joint of weed and the boys only look about 12. Be cautious when watching this film is you are easily shocked or offended. As a teen I found it sick and unjustifying. But it deserves credit for delivering controvery to film."
4,Great movie?,"This movie was pretty good, though there is a lot of sex, drugs, drinking, violence etc... I'm from NYC and some ppl i know are like that i think it shows what teen life is like for some ppl in NY. I loved how they used Washington Sq. Park-a lot of ppl that are like the charaters in the movie go to that park for the same reasons... skateboard, pick fights, do drugs etc.... This movie seemed so real and i hope there would be more movies like this. -14"
5,"A Real eye opener and truth to the consequences of ""kids""!","When i first sat down and watched this movie i was utterly indistgust and suprised, it really opened my eyes, im 18 male and improud to say that im a virgin and other teens should know that this is a bad road to go on if you are doing this behind the backs of your parents, To the parents, you should get your kids and sit down together and watch this movie, It's a real eye opener and see that this a wrong path to go on having unprotected sex, drugs alchol. all teens should look at this movie. Unproteceted sex can get you killed it's a death warrant and suicide."
5,everyone needs to listen up!,"the first time i saw this movie, it really gave me a reality check as to who i was as a person. it appears as though the people who are always putting this movie down are people who either grew up in a very secluded neighborhood, or people who think that their kids could never get involved in an atmosphere such as the one seen in ""KIDS"". What people do behind their parents backs, is most of the time expected to be undiscovered and Mr. Clark has given today's society a very long-overdue wake up call to the parents out there, so that they are more involved."
1,"A modern-day ""Reefer Madness""","I watched this film with some at-risk teenagers and probably the funniest comment I heard was, ""They made this movie like a documentary because the rest of it is so fake."" When I first saw it, I was like other people who think that this is an artistic reflection of real life. I grew up with kids who used drugs and sex for recreation, and I imagined that things had gotten worse since I left my teens.Then I listened to the comments of teens who have lived in crackhouses, who have been shot at, who were raised by folks who traded their bodies for drugs or cash - and THEY'RE saying this movie is unrealistic.Telly, with his multitude of willing virgins, is more a dark fantasy of a teenage player than a real teen - rather like ""Reefer Madness,"" which had more to do with middle-class America's fear of marijuana than actual drug use. I wonder if this film will seem as dated in a few more decades as ""message"" films from the '60s and '70s."
3,Kids,"While kids is an interesting movie, it can also be described as disturbing. If someone is easily upset or offended I wouldn't recommend this title for viewing."
2,Amazement and Shock,"I was bored, amazed and shocked by this movie. I was amazed that this was shown.... and sad at the listlessness in these young people's lives... and at the fact that these kids had nothing doing in their lives. I was laughing at the comparisons of the boys and girls talking. I was shocked at the callousness and indulgency of the rape scene. It still leaves me with anger. What this showed was the lack of respect for women and also every woman's fear of being raped while in such a vunerable space. It was amazing to see the beginnings of such addictive behavior and obvious at the lack of personal time and care in their homes. A very raw movie."
1,"""kids"" will be kids","People are forgetting how to make memorable films without having to shock people to get it noticed. There are a bunch of kids , wearing droopy jeans, with their undies hangin out, who do drugs and have sex. Full of annoying slang and even worse fashion. It was too ""directed"" and wooden. If I hear ""peace out"" one more time my head will explode...It was like watching one of those boot camp episodes on ""Sally"" Jesse Raphael.."
1,If you want to send a message...,"I watched this movie when I was in high school. I hated every last minute of it, as did everyone I watched it with. The person who insisted we rent it apologized profusely. Spending two hours watching a movie about the type of person I was glad to see wind up in juvie was about as rewarding and worthwhile as shooting myself in the leg with a nail gun."
1,Where was Robin Williams?,"The only thing that could have made this movie better is Robin Williams. I expected a ""wonderfully funny, bright and cheery"" (the New York Times) cameo performance by the Great Hairy Comedian, but instead I just got a bunch of kids talking about sex. Big deal, I can get that walking into Soho."
4,"Gritty, harsh look at misguided youth.","Kids pulls no punches. It's a slap in the face. A harsh 90 minutes that only gets more intense as it progresses toward it's troubling and shocking climax.I do think this is a movie all people should see. I would even go so far as to say that pre-teens should watch this movie with their parents. Kids vividly illustrates how brutal life can be if you have no one to guide you. This movie is here to shock you. It's here to tell you what could happen if children aren't given an education on sex, drugs and alcohol."
4,Very Real,"If I didn't know any better, I would have thought this film was a documentary on troubled youth, not a movie. The actors did a great job with their roles. However, I'm still not sure who was acting and who wasn't. The film is about a distrubed teen, Tully (Leo Fitzpatrick), who wants to de-virginize as many young virgins as he can. It's about teenagers growing up too fast and the consequences. I liked it a lot, but it isn't for everyone."
2,These are NOT like the kids in my neighbourhood!,"Kids choses a tender subject to talk about : Aids among teenagers . Here we see young people who haven't yet had the chance to taste life and experiences like marriage and motherhood spread the deadly virus . Yet like Bully , in Kids as well i get the feeling than Larry Clark lost the control of his material . What is meant to be bold and challenging seems actually excessive to the average viewer . The parents in this movie are totally alieneted in their own dreamy world. Chloe Sevigny gives a promising first perfomance while Pierce and Fitzpatrick are also convicing yet "" Kids "" , for all it's brutal truths doesn't touch the viewer as much as it should have ."
1,Dreck for Dreck's Sake,"You have to have an affinity for what is most loathsome in human nature to appreciate the unrelenting vileness and a-morality celebrated in this movie. Okay, whether it is actually celebrated is, of course, arguable. However, this movie does nothing more than show us sordidness after sordidness: Teenage Telly practicing his favorite pasttime (next to getting high, perhaps)--painfully deflowering very young virgins; Telly kicking some poor slob nearly to death. Sex, drugs, sex, drugs, ad tedium.This movie might show us what *some* kids indulge in, but it really shows us nothing new, leads us to no new understanding of, well, anything under the sun except perhaps our own stoicism should we heroically make it through the entire movie.In a word: Blech!"
3,IT COULD HAVE HAD MORE GRAPHIC SCENES AT THE START,"ALL IN ALL I WOULD RECOMMEND PARENT'S TO SIT DOWN WITH THEIR KIDS AND WATCH THE WHOLE THING, IN ORDER TO GET THE MESSAGE ACROSS TO THE KIDS ABOUT DRUGS, AND SEX"
1,It was stupid,"I can't imagine why anyone would praise this film. Okay maybe it is a reality check for our society, but so what?? It's a horribly acted, horribly scripted, uncreative, unoriginal and VERY exploitive film. The mere fact that it accurately depicts the lowest form of young degenerates in American society doesn't by itself make this a good film. Any idiot can film a bunch of teens having sex, getting intoxicated, beating up and raping people. But the film doesn't go beyond these depictions. it doesn't offer any solutions or explore the root causes of such behavior. And how many times do we need to be shown teens having sex or being raped to get the message? One time was shocking enough to be educational. Three or four times turns it into simple exploitation. This is little more than glorified child pornography."
4,"""Kids"" DVD","I first watched this movie when I was 15 years old, when the movie first came out on VHS. I loved it then, and just as much now! It showed how wild the kids in America were. When I was 15, I could relate to this movie. I was wild with parents that wasn't around as much as they should have been. All I cared about was drinking, doing drugs, listening to music, getting laid and partying! Not much has changed since then in America with kids being wild. Maybe, if more parents would watch this movie, they would know what to expect. I've always loved this movie, and always will. When I received the DVD in the mail, it was in better shape than I expected. I'm completely satisfied with my purchase!"
4,Real life Movie!!!,I watched this movie years ago and thought it would be best to purchase it. This movie is a wake up call for parents and young adults. There is a lot of vulgar language used in this movie but when you understand what the movie is all about then you will see why the language is used. If you are not from a urban city then you will not be able to understand the mindset behind this movie. This movie is not for kids despite the title of the movie.
2,Movie doesn't deal with the issues,"While this movie brings to light some important social issues, it never goes deep enough and certainly offers no solutions. KIDS wants to shock us by showing underage sex and drug use, yet does little more. Where is the writer going with this? Does he simply want us to be a voyeur to the troubled teens in this film? I first saw this movie when I was 15 and I thought it was completely over-hyped and your average teenager is not acting the way those in the movie do. Today I feel the same way. It's an unrealistic portrayal that doesn't go beneath the surface to explore the character's intentions."
1,Boring,"This is low grade, boring, exploitative rubbish. Only shocking to the thoroughly naive. It's high rating is a testament to the gullibility of the general public."
1,Absolutely horrible.,"This is by far the worst movie I have ever watched. Perhaps it is realistic if you live in inner city New York, or Chicago, but the majority of the world does not live like this. And there are very few teenagers that have the maturity to watch this and not think it's ""cool"" to do these things. This movie was all about shock value. And it looks like it served its purpose."
4,Disturbing Reality for Kids,"This film is disturbingly fantastic. The raw depiction, in almost documentary form, shows young people dealing with the frightening, real horrors of a predator/prey sensibility resulting from oppression, peer pressure and a need to belong. NOT for kids."
4,I had to watch and so did my kids,"It may make your pre-teen or teenager uncomfortable to watch, but it will open their minds and get them to think which is exactly what we want for them to do. At least that's what I want my 3 daughters to do. Think. Think before reacting to all horomone drunken thoughts. I had to watch it when I was a teenager and so do they. Anyhoo, good buy."
3,"A little too, ""in your face"" for me.","I like the reality part of this film; I think they tried to put it in your face a little too much. I'd rent it, maybe show it to my out of control teen, and show them what might happen if they didn't have any responsibility or rules. Make sure you tell them ahead of time you don't approve of, nor support the behavior that takes place. Be quick to point out they could be on the other side of those kids at anytime. Anyhow, rent it watch it."
3,AUDIO PROBLEMS,"This is a great movie. However, the DVDs audio track starts to stagger from the video track half way through. Great movie...disappointed in the quality of the DVD."
1,A grossly exaggerated and inaccurate generalization of youth,DO NOT BUY THIS. It is an insult to the human race
5,"I think it is a wakeup call for every teen, and parent.","This is a movie that i will keep, and watch with my children in their teen years, or maby preteen years.This is a movie that every parent, and teenager must see."
4,Whoa,"I think this movie is heartbreaking, but amazing. I saw this a long time ago, and I recently went Best Buy and bought it, and I watched it again, thinking this is about four times worse then the movie ""thirteen"" in terms of kids getting in trouble. I love how it shows the downside to having sex - most shows and movies just have the characters go all out, like on ""Friends"" and not have any consequences. I think it's good that they show someone with HIV and Telly probably has it too. I think it sucks though that Jenny couldn't tell him in time, or Casper wouldn't have wanted to rape her then, if he had known. I really think that you should buy it, watch, but don't let your kids watch it unless they're headed down the wrong path."
1,THE WORST!,"I am not talking about the plot, I am not talking about the acting. This movie is UTTERLY disgusting! I don't understand how a person with a normal level of intelligence can observe the badly played out scenes from the life of totally degraded low lives with no moral values whatsoever. And those lowlives are presented in a somewhat positive, sympathetic manner...(???!!!) This is probably the worst movie I've ever seen in my life!"
1,IT WAS THE WORST M/F MOVIE IN THE WORLD,ALL I CAN SAY IS IT WAS TOTAL BULL SH*T I MEAN WHO WANTS TO WATCH A UNREAL MOVIE WITH SEX DRUGS AND MORE SEX LETS GET A HOLD OF OURSELVES HERE PARENTS WATCH OUT KEEP THIS GARBAGE AWAY FROM YOUR CHILDREN!!!
2,kids,well I bought this because a friend said it was a very sick movie sick being a horrible movie so I bought it lol. Anyway its something you watch once and are like wow im nver watching this again. The seller shipped very fast on the positive side
4,interesting educational movie...,"KIDS has to be one of the greatest movies ever made. I could watch this movie just about every day. One scary aspect of this movie is the fact that this is just about how about half of the people i know live this way.I THINK THIS MOVIE WAS EXTREMELY SAD AS IT WAS TEACHING. I FELT SORRY FOR DARCY AND FOR JENNY. TELLY DID NOT EVEN KNOW HE HAD THIS VIRUS, AND WAS GOING AROUND INFECTING THESE VIRGIN GIRLS ONE BY ONE. WHAT WAS GOOD ABOUT IT WAS THAT JENNY WAS TRYING TO SAVE DARCY FROM SHARING HER FATE, BUT SADLY IT WAS TOO LATE.I THINK ALL TEENS SHOULD BE SAT DOWN BY THEIR PARENTS AND WATCH THIS MOVIE SO THEY WON'T SHARE THE FATE OF THE CHARACTERS IN THIS MOVIE..."
4,See it Once,"I think it's pretty funny that one of the reviewer's uncles rented the movie to watch with his nephew because he thought it was for young kids! In 1995, this movie caused a huge stir. It was on the news, it was panned by the critics for being exploitive, etc. You would have to be pretty isolated not to have heard about it.It was also, I believe, Chloe Sevigny's first film. And she is terrific. The rest of the people in the film are amateur actors and Larry Clark's first film feels like a student film. But somehow, it comes off as artistic. I think the mistake people made is that this was some sort of ""warning"" or ""life lesson"" film. Larry Clark just thought it would be a good theme for a movie; to take a different route to explain teenage behavior and how the adult world continues to misperceive them. As for taste, the film is more voyeuristic than pornographic, and to tell you the truth, it's lost its shock value over the past nine years.So I suggest: see it once, and then move on."
4,Interesting peek into a group of kid's lives,"I think that this movie was interesting on the basis of that this is what some kids, not all by any means, but some, go through everyday. I think that this movie is very accurate in portraying the lives of these few select ""kids"" with adult issues and problems.I highly recomend this movie"
5,It May Not Be Your Reality But It Is Mine,"It kills me when people say that Kids is an unrealistic discription of teen life. For one thing, the people who say that are 40+ and are hoping this is not what their kids are doing. Second, these kids were not living in the cornfields of Ohio, they were in the ghetto. They were not acting psycho, they were just being kids, reckless, searching kids. Just like me. I never once doubted the reality of this movie. I was just wondering why someone took so long to bust the Breakfast Club bubble of the 80s and tell the truth about the 90s teen. We do stupid things and think we have every right to do it. Why should anyone have control of our lives, it not rebellion, its God given freedom. This is how the teenage mind works. Those miniture ""psychos"" are going to grow up and inherit the world. BE PREPARED!!!! If your kid doesn't know people who act like the characters in Kids, they ARE the person who acts like that."
5,Realistic niew of adolescence,"Ever wonder what your kids are doing when they say they're staying at a friend's place over the weekend? Ever think to yourself ""Im sure i had another $10 in there""....This movie is not only entertaining, but educational to both parents and adolescents. My only quam is that in some cases it glorifies the life these kids are living. No doubt in their own mind they are living in glory, however, the stark reality is quite the opposite, and i think this message gets blurred at times."
4,Shows the real world our kids live,"This film shows clearly what most people try to hide or ignore: our kids are living their lifes without any sense of morality. Some would say this movie is not a picture of what is goinging on our streets, but they have to face it, it is!"
3,Probably one of the most disturbing movies I have ever seen,"I rented this film well aware of how shocking it might be, but little did I know that it was more disturbing and realistic then I had ever imagined. This very powerful film has almost no plot line, but manages to leave a lasting effect that will stay with you. I would recommend KIDS to anyone who thinks they can handle this brutal film, because it does make you think about your life, and question some of the things that go on in this world. The scariest part of this movie is the fact that this could happen anywhere, and to anyone. The many haunting images are guaranteed to stay in your head for a long time."
5,It is an excellent book.,"This book is a well-written critique on character education. It realistically categorizes the popular sects of moral philosophy and gives each one a fair yet tough analysis of it's strengths and weaknesses. The writing itself is very good, and makes a relatively dry topic entertaining. If you are interested in understanding the trends of contemporary moral education, I would suggest buying this."
4,my true age is irrelevant,"Now mind you, Pop/Rock is garbadge. People complain about the exponential number of post-hardcore/hardcore with simliar bands that have clones and are a disgrace to music. Well, pop punk seems to be lacking clones, mostly becuase most of the bands suck in their own special way.Fortunatly, this is not the case for Boys Like Girls. Dumb name? Yes. But it's appropriate for it's High School romance like lyrics and sound. A bad thing? Only if you're one of those people with a musical royalty stick up your butt.Now, there isn't really a terrible song off this ablum, it's extremely catchy, they've mastered the art of the hook. But then again, so has most rap artists, so that's not saying much. None the less, I'm struggling to think of a pop/rock band better then them at the moment. They seem really in their element and for a debut, their experience level and ability to write quality music is beyond their years. Expect them to sell out soon. Until then, pick this up."
3,Just buy the song you like,"I bought this whole album for one song, ""Thunder"", and ended up only really liking one other song on the album. I think it's more for the teen persuasion."
3,Dissapointing,"I liked the previews of the songs, but once i bought it i thought that all the songs sounded the same."
3,ewwww.,what the all american rejects.i swear ive heard this before.ill give them credit.they actually tried and actually got a record label.which is pretty hard.so kudos to that.but they sound almost the same to all american rejects.i know they arent cause the two singers dont look a thing alike.but they sound exactly the same.but yeah.i would buy it if i was desperate.but yeah.go out and buy it if you really want.its not my first pick though.
4,Nice Debut,"Saw these guys open for Butch Walker in Boston a couple months ago and they played a nice set. Since I liked what I heard I picked up the album. Good stuff, give it a listen."
2,Buy the Single,"The first song from the self-titled album, Boys Like Girls, is the only one repeated listening has found worth listening too at all. Mainly only because it is the only one I can tell apart from the others. If you're looking for good background noise, this fits the requirements; if you're looking for good listening, buy the single if you must have it. ""The Great Escape"" isn't worth trapping yourself into the full CD."
5,AMAZING!,"When i found this Cd i was so excited because i fell in love with the song, ""Thunder"" for it's romanticness and the rest of the CD IS INCREDIBLE> Upbeat, fun and very very catchy! I have it all memorized!!! It's easy to relate to and to sing along to!!I love Be my escape, Hero/heroine and Thunder~~ The whole cd is wonderful.Keep Rocking guys!"
2,"Good writing, terrible printing","This is an exciting story for the era, with mystery and violence and romance and childhood innocence. It is extremely melodramatic at times--purposefully, no doubt--which adds to the humor of the book. Easy read. This particular printing, however, is completely terrible. There are typos, missing punctuation, and backwards quotation marks. I would recommend this book to lovers of 19th century literature, but please, buy from a different printer!"
4,"Classic Video, audio lacks","This is a great video of all the perfomers that are mentioned in the sleeve. But, the audio really doesn't meet the mark as far as I am concerned. It is good, though. I recommend this video for anyone who is really interested in any of these stars. Just remember that the audio is a bit less than you might expect from a DVD."
4,"Lotsa country music stars here in this film..., and Doodles Weaver too!","Does it have a hoaky plot, yes.But it has a boatload of classic country & western stars, many no longer with us, also on board is the late Doodles Weaver.The PQ and AQ are not the greatest in the world, bot they are good enough where you can still enjoy the film.The master comes from Golden Key Video, I have never heard of them.The Rhino single disc is way OOP Full Screen and expensive, but Mill Creek has included the film in ANAMORPHIC WIDESCREEN the very affordable,Rare Cult Cinema, which also gives you 11 other films was well as this one, an awesome bargain!"
3,a ahrd watch,"For classic country fans this is a must,the voice over singingis a little trite but it's good to see the real country stars that made this music what it should be. Ignor the acting because there isn't any worth watching, but when you hear lefty frizzel sing i love you a thousand ways,it will make it worth the watch."
1,Useless DVD Return system is crap,"DVD arrived very quick delivery but does not work, trying to get an address to return it and get a replacement is proving a most difficult one to crack.Very dissapointed. Jim Kinghan."
5,the road to nashville,"a,1,,,,one hundred percent recomended;;;;;a brillent dvd i play this dvd every night,it is full with all my favourit country music,i just think it is a,a,1 plus,,,,,,,,"
4,very cool,Nice book with lots of stunning pictures and good text about the history of the band.But it should be a bigger book.
4,A thoughtful book,I enjoy Lowen's writing style. Fear of Life was my first Lowen; since then I have read many more of his books.
2,Pretty but not made well,They are not fitted. They are very puffy and baggy. Do not fit at all like they are suppose to.
5,Eye-Opener,"Bearing through the storm of unexpected ailment and deterioration in a loved one is never a sought-out experience. Kathy Boswell guides and prepares the reader for such a journey in YOUR MOTHER HAS SUFFERED A SLIGHT STROKE with clarity and honesty. Tackling the throes of hushed medical propoganda, retirement home adjustments, and neurological damage, she leads and enlightens through persistence born by love. We would be wise to share in her journey for our own family emergencies with are certain to arise."
2,Movie review,This is not an altogether bad movie it just almost is. I wouldn't buy it again. Probably the worst part is the directing and camera work.
3,HOT and Slow...,"Some great scenes of Kari and 2 other women, but the plot is a bit plodding and the story line is hard to understand. If you are looking for skin, this film has 2 decent scenes, but nothing else to recommend it."
3,poison,Great looking girls.Who said to watch a 100 woman instead?100 WOMAN WAS NOTHING BUT A SAD ATTEMPT AT A MOVIE.This sort of remind me of the Hand That Rocks The Cradle.Anything that Karrie si involved in is superb.100 woman what a laugh to try to substitute that with this.A great watch!!!
3,"Good Movie, but could have been better","This movie is worth being watched only for Kari Wuhrer. If you are a Kari fan, you will see a lot of her in it. Good movie to watch before sleep."
4,Part three of McKenzie's trilogy,"After Rahab Link, which for reasons unknown is not available via amazon.com (I found it at barnesandnoble.com), this is the third and final instalment of Joshua Bain's and Alan Hunt's spying adventures. Fast action, tense suspense and some poignant moments define this story and make it an enjoyable, though sometimes slightly far-fetched read. Sometimes the vernacular seems forced (many a gratuitous ""like"" despite otherwise immaculate syntax in oral speech makes for a clash in style), but other than that, McKenzie does a good job of writing; I was impressed by its page-turner qualities.Warning: Read the first two parts first! Both Rahab Link and Jordan Intercept contain references to the previous book(s) and may give away plot elements thereof.Rahab Link also deserves four stars."
2,Used book really used!!,"I like to buy used books from Amazon (great prices). They have always been in excellent condition. I have to say that this is the first time, I was not totally satisfied. Although the book was in decent condition, it was not in the condition that I am normally use to with Amazon books. The cover was wrinkled from bending and some of the pages were still turned at the corners and not even fixed before it was shipped. I wish maybe having a picture of the book might be helpful although I realize that this is not practical. All the more the description needs to really apply to the book being purchased.I will give it one more chance before I stop buying used books. Just be leery of used products."
2,That was a rough read,"Maybe I went into this book with poor expectations, but I was disappointed on the content and how it was written. It read much more like a PhD thesis than a book. It was also highly one sided in it's opinions of the Church and Jewish people. I am sad to say I walked away with very little useful information."
4,Eye-opening for Christians,I have recommended this book to many other Christians. I've found it has expanded my understanding of both the Tanach (Old Testament) and the Christian New Testament.
3,Good,"Dr. Wilson's book offers a counteractive to the deleterious effect of neglecting the shared Jewish heritage. The book, however, does fall into emotional pleading, and somewhat glosses over the reasons why Rabbinic Judaism rejected the incipient Messianic Jewish movement."
3,Good Title But......,I love the concept of the book however the language is very lofty for the lay person. It is written in text book language.
5,The Semite people are our friends,This book finally reveals and understands the in-depth relationship of Christianity and its roots. There are millions of people that have lived before Christ was on Earth but they believed in the same God. You will see them in heaven although they have never met Jesus personally while on Earth since Jesus was born after they died.Other recommended titles by Christian authors:Apocalyptic Secrets of the Hebrew Sanctuary
3,Enjoyable textbook,Written somewhat like a textbook with questions at the end of each chapter. I found the subject matter and format easy to read and understand.I would especially recommend this book to non-Jews who have not had the opportunity to study their roots.
5,Excellent insight into Jewish lifestyle for any Christian,"I have purchased 20 of these books and given them to friends. The search for Christians to reach out and understand their Jewish roots is vital for the correction or misapplication of some of our beliefs. This book points toward a more powerful and insightful lifestyle, and brings understanding to a much needed area."
4,Believe It!!!,This is a great game. I'm only up to the B rank missions right now but the jist of the game is this: you start off with D rank missions and move up to higher missions with higher difficulties. Along the way you'll unlock different characters (27 in total) and different jutsus. I love the attention to detail. Each character has their own distinct fighting style and not just a cheap copy of moves when performing regular attacks. They also use the real character's voices. Allowing you to use other character's signature jutsus is also a nice feature. I've only got 1/2 the characters unlocked right now but I'm loving this game and I can't put it down. Definitly a must-buy for Naruto fans.
4,Pretty Decent Game,"Okay, first of all, this has no storyline. It's all about ranking up. You start off as a low-ranking ninja doing easy D-ranked missions and end as a Jonin doing S-Rank missions. If you don't mind that, then this game is pretty good. As another reviewer said, I like how each character has their own qualities. Lee is faster than Choji, and I believe other characters can jump higher than others (say, Kakashi and Naruto).The downside is it's fairly short, it only took me a total of 11 hours to beat it as it is pretty easy if you play it on the normal level, and I found only two of the missions really challenging (Defend the Bridge and 100-Man Spar). I think you can play it over again though to unlock some wallpaper or something. The graphics are okay, it's not all 3D and flashy or anything but it'll do.Overall, I'd say it's a great game, perfect for when you're bored or you just want to kick some butt as your favorite Naruto character."
2,A ok but but to easy game,I had odert this game inaug had it beatwithin 3day of ordring it it not the best game but its fun.
2,"Well, at least there was man candy. But...","You have to listen to boy band music for almost the entire movie! Frankly, I can't imagine anything more horrifying. It made me flashback to my much younger sister's infatuation with New Kids on the Block.I'll need my teddy bear to get to sleep tonight.I've seen a couple of other DeCoteau films (Witches of the Caribbean and The Sisterhood) and both were much better than this."
2,BAD BACKSTREET BOYS,"If you've ever seen a David DeCouteau movie (Brotherood, Leeches, Werewolves of New York) you know what to expect: a homoerotic mishmash of ridiculous plotting, hunky boys in skimpy underwear; and relentless padding consisting of slow motion swaggering and lots of pecs and abs. In RING OF DARKNESS, Adrienne Barbeau (Swamp Thing, Fog, Creepshow, Maude) plays the boy band's seductive manager who stages an audition to replace the band's lead singer who tried to leave them after he found out what the boys in the band were in reality. Barbeau does well as always, but the rest of the insanely attractive cast needs acting lessons badly. By the time you've figured out just what these hunks do to keep their looks, you've had to sit through some pretty derivative plotting and a predictably campy ending. DeCouteau needs to rethink his future projects and at least come up with more than just pretty bods."
1,"Wow, this is BAD!","I think this may have grazed my top ten list of bad horror movies (it is right up there with movies like ""half-caste""). This just redefined the word bad. It is defecation. The best way to describe this is to imagine an episode of the power rangers meeting an MTV boy band video: It has very bad acting, slow, generic killing scenes (each victim is surround by members of a boy band and smothered so you cannot see what they do to the victim) At least half of the movie is a generic music video (singing throughout the movie) You almost have to see it to believe it, and I definitely wouldn't recommend seeing it. This movie is the equivalent to getting kicked in the groin or going to the dentist. This movie will make you want to hurt someone, or vomit uncontrollably. It will make you want to peel your eyelids off with a fork. Oh and did I mention it was bad?"
1,Wow bad even by DeCoteau standards,A real time waster. Not even decent underwear scenes for those who buy these things for that.
1,Oh no...,"One star is being generous, this is probably the worst film I have ever seen, and I've seen some pretty bad ones. I like B horror movies but this was WAY below that. It actually played out more like a gay porno movie than anything else with the blood ritual in black briefs? IF the movie were going for $4.99 I'd consider sending it to my cousin as a joke who loves zombie movies. But these weren't even zombies, they had grey makeup and looked kind of like the guys from V, the old movie/TV Show, but they didn't even have scales! It was just grey makeup! Do yourself a favor and run, don't walk, away from this film! Cooking with Porn stars was a better buy than this would be, and that movie was REALLY bad. I don't know who thought to sell it for $24, discounted to $22, but if they sell one at that price, it should just about cover the budget for the film with those ""special"" effects of the burnt zombies which were really piles of sand from down the beach on the same set."
4,Cool!!!,Cool but different !!!!!!!!!The voices do never chang like someone eles said...the movie not your typical but its not that bad some boring parts but ok.......
2,Rather boring and REALLY cheaply made - Play Forbidden Island instead.,"I love playing cooperative board games with my kids, especially games such as Forbidden Island and Castle Panic. Based on the reviews that I had read, Caves & Claws seemed like another fun addition to our family collection. However, once we got the game and tried it a couple of times, it hasn't been played since. The rules are a bit vague on several things, and there was never a true sense of ""Uh-Oh, how are we going to over come this?"" that make good co-op games so much fun to play. Unless you really aren't trying, it seems impossible to lose.Also, the paper tokens feel like they'll tear at any moment, and the game board and cards are poorly printed. There is a small card in the game that explains that the company uses recyclable materials, but that shouldn't be an excuse to make the game feel cheap.There are better options."
3,pete waye and the SCHENK,"To those of us that are older then most,we remember the first music by the master(lonesome crow) the man made his place in rock history, it is very SAD that he is not the god of rock in the U.S as he is in other countries! the U.S fans all though hardcore are little in numbers,us fans that have been there though all the rebirths of michiel will aways love him no matter where he wanders or how many guitars he sells.WE STILL LOVES YOU MICHAEL AND ALWAYS WILL!!!!!!!!!!the true fans of the bay area!!!!!"
4,The Reference Shelf BIOTECHNOLOGY -- ed. by Lynn Messina,"This is an excellent selection of twenty-five recent articles, mostly from the popular press, dealing with the implications of cloning and other rapidly-expanding biotechnologies. Topics include: the human genome project, genetic testing, cloning, gene therapy, bio-engineering, human-computer interfaces, life-span modification, organ transplantation, genetically modified crop plants and farm animals; a number of controversial viewpoints are explored. An interesting bibliography is also included along with synopses of a number of related articles. Most of the articles in the book date from the last two years."
4,Stilted & Difficult Reading,"Menaced Assissin is an interesting book of murder & revenge. However, it is filled with a disertation of evolutionary theories throughout which could have been condensed. I sometimes got the feeling that the writer's main focus was to demonstrate his knowledge, and push his idea of evolution on the reader by embedding it in this novel. The reading was also stilted and difficult to read at times. However, it was an interesting story with graphic descriptions of the killings, which kept me interested in knowing who the killer was."
1,Dont waste your money or time!!!!,This product is very very cheaply made and very awkward to use and handle.The reception is terrible I seriously doubt it would last a week without breaking if you actually carried it around.
1,It was very wordy and the worst book I have ever read,"Seriously, this book is just convoluted and boring. I can't believe this is called a classic. Its terrible and the educators at certain high schools should not force this book upon kids--it lowers their grades and intelligence."
1,Rip off of movie Clueless,Best I can figure this Jane Auston womanstoll the plot of Clueless and rote a book.Too many coincidences to make me believeanything else. Why Alecia Sivlerstonedoesn't sue Jane Austin is beyond me!
1,Quality is an illusion,"While cultural pundits try to convince you that some literature is better than other literature, the truth is that all art is relative to individial tastes. Thus, it doesn't make any sense to think that a novel like this one is really any better than say, Michael Crichton or Stephen King. Aesthetic standards can't be grounded.Thus, don't listen to anyone who tries to distinguish between ""serious"" works of literature like this one and allegedly ""lesser"" novels. The distinction is entirely illusory, because no novels are ""better"" than any others, and the concept of a ""great novel"" is an intellectual hoax."
1,Emma - Noteable for dubious reasons,"There is one principle reason that Emma is remembered. It was written by a woman. If Jane Austen had been a man, her works would be regarded as banal and inconsequential works of little literary merit. The work is impressive considering that Austen came from a culture that repressed women (a characteristic that most female authors share), but beyond that it is a poor work.There is a profusion of works of greater literary merit by women than what Austen offers, Mary Shelly's ""Frankenstein"", Kate Chopin's ""The Awakening"", Alice Walker's ""The Color Purple"", ""Nectar in a Seive"" by Kamala Markandaya, or a very fine piece ""Their Eyes Were Watching God"" by Zora Neale Hurston. All of these works have better characteristics than ""Emma"", and prove to be superior to all of Austen's writings.Trust me, ""Emma"" is a waste."
4,"Good Victorian book, well written, good characterization","Emma was a very well written book in the Victorian era. Jane Austen did a wounderful job portaying the life of a welathy woman in this era. I enjoyed reading this book because it went from Emma being ""young"" and childish to her being more mature, and eventually falling in love."
2,banishment,"First of all a good advice to all students who are condemned to read this so called 'Best' work by Jane Austen: It is enough to read every 5th chapter and you've got the outline It is absolutely not necessary to read the whole 400 pages I don't know why but somehow Emma has reminded me of a friend who always cares about things the others don't need-she's a failure as matchmaker and meddler as well I wonder why people like Emma are predestined to get out of their struggles without sh... on their faces Greetings to the 1* reader And I p...myself laughing about Elton's proposal in the carriage-quite clever,she couldn't escape just fall out as an alternative-poor,fragile Emma! And cleverness is a matter the recipient's point of view Just do the'Cross-Reading'and spare yourself the rest Yours affectionately A Frustrated Student :)"
1,Not the edition I ordered & very late!,"I ordered this book for a class and needed a specific edition, which I ordered. I ordered it around the 18th of December or even a couple days earlier, did not receive it until January 8th, and received a completely different edition than I bought."
1,Too boring,This novel was boring. I couldn't stay with it. The lives of the characters did not interest me.I did not enjoy Emma's matchmaking!
1,have yet to recieve this book !,"Orederd this book on June 5, was supost to be here by the 18th. It is 6-25-12 and no book!"
4,Reads a lot like the plot of the movie Clueless,"Too many similiarities between this book and the much better Alicia Silverstone movie Clueless for me to recommend it to everyone but all in all if you like your teen comedies set in Victorian england and not LA, go for it. Grab it before Hollywood discovers the similarities and gets it yanked off the shelf with a court order. Maybe Austen can write her next one based on the plot of Bill and Ted's Excellent Adventure. Set it South Africa during the Boar war or something"
1,Do Not Buy,"When you buy a public domain book, all you really want is a well-formatted edition. This isn't it. The left margin is wider than the right margin. Kindle formatting isn't hard; why can't public domain publishers get it right!"
2,this book bored me. does that make me a bad person?,"the first chapter is a model of precision. in only nine pages, a handful of characters are introduced with masterful clarity. subtle dialouge paints a portrait of each character with a depth that many novelists never achieve over the course of hundreds of pages. jane austen's supreme talent is shining bright. then what happens? it goes on and on and on. and i got severely bored. i did not care about emma's social schemes, her obssession with ones rank within society. she is simply a dull character. and the language ultimately grows tiresome. the purple prose weighed heavy on my poor brain after a hundred pages. a bit beyond page 220 i jumped ship. i simply could not finish this dull thing. sorry."
2,emma,I loved Jane Austins book Pride and Prejudice but her book Emma was no where near as good. Characters were shallow and the plot took too long to develop. I was not very satisfied.
2,bez,"The book is certainly ""wordy"" if nothing else. If you can endure the lengthy comments of each character which have no effect on the ""bottom line"", it may be fairly interesting in the personality study of the characters. I'm skimming as much as possible in order to see what happens to each character. I have one more of her books, and if it is laborous as this one, I don't plan to read it."
2,satisfactory if you want text of novel only,"This is a novel written a long time ago. A lot of the terms and expressions need explanations for the modern reader. This edition of the masterwork by Austen does not have footnotes at the end, nor does it have an up-to-date scholarly introduction by some University professor."
5,Well read and enjoyable.,"This is a lovely version of, ""Emma"", by Jane Austen. However, I discovered it was one of my least favorites by her, so I now have ""read"" it via audio book and can now say I don't need to buy the hard back version. Thank you for your great service."
2,Waste of time,I think this is the worst Jane Autsten book I have read. I had to force myself to finish it and was very tired of it by the end. The diologe is long and boring. I won't read Emma again.
5,how chick flicks should be!,Jane Austen gets it right again with the heroine being worthy of the great guy. Fun story with good characters.
4,Emma,"A classic gem done full justice by the superb reading of Prunella Scales. A great listening experience was marred, however, by a surprising and disappointing flaw in disc 8 which rendered the final track unintelligible.It would be much appreciated if you could replace this faulty disc, as such a literary masterpiece deserves to be presented and preserved in mint condition.The damaged disc apart, Jane Austen would surely applaud this excellent rendition of her beloved Emma."
4,Great Book.,"Emma is another one of Jane Austen's novels. It's a good book, however I don't believe it's as good as Pride and Prejudice. The protagonist, Emma, is a very bright and handsome young lady. It seems that the protagonists of Jane Austen are always female, intelligent, and pretty. The characters in this book are complex. For example, an elderly well-known bachelor suddenly falls in love and took a wife of about the same age as he. His reason for marrying is also strange, because he simply wanted to have a wife. And Emma was the person who started and encouraged their relationship. The plot was interesting too, a few surprises here and there.My problem with Emma is that it wasn't as engrossing a story as Pride and Prejudice. But this is a different style of book, so it's really unfair for me to say that Emma is not as good as Pride and Prejudice. Other than that, it's a wonderful book.I recommend it to readers who want dialogue-based novels."
4,Almost as good as P&P!,"I really enjoyed this a lot. It's not quite as good as Pride and Prejudice, but it is better than Sense and Sensibility. It still has a lot of things to say that are still very much pertinent to modern times. Austen's longest work is an entertaining romp that shows what happens when one young girl gets too involved in the affections of (and between) others. Although overlong, it's still a really, really entertaining read."
3,A Classic that didn't captivate me,"I did my best to read this book but I just couldn't get into it. The book is well written and clearly at a 187 years old, has stood the test of time. Nonetheless, at this stage in my life I was not motivated to finish the book."
4,Emma Audiobook,"Lively, vivid rendition of my favourite Jane Austen novel. Prunella Scales interprets the characters with great individuality and spirit."
4,Love,"I love Jane Austen as much as the next girl & I was so excited to read Emma. However, the style is sometimes a bit difficult to get around!"
4,Some Austin Fun,"This is a quick read that seems like it could be out of today's headlines. And with a nice, if expected, twist at the end it's an antidote to some of the more gruesome love stories that seem to populate our bookshelves today like ""Gone Girl"" --- another great read, but a much different take on love/marriage."
4,Exhasperatingly delightful!,"Though exhasperating at times, Emma enchants us all. It is through Emma's repeated blunders,imprudence, and vanity that she becomes one of the most charming heroines of all times. Jane Austen has created a hilarious set of characters: the preposterously overprotective father, the poor chatterbox neighbour, the pretty, lighthearted protegé, and the man of reason whose love finally dictates against his logic (to name a very few). Although the plot is at times made dreary by Miss Bates' prolongued monologues, the novel is otherwise a light read. One must not expect to turn the last page having learnt some universal truth, but rather having enjoyed a few good laughs, some heart-leaping, and a few sighs. Emma is an outstanding proof of Jane Audten's wit; the candour and modesty in her novel make it a truly refreshing read."
4,Teenage Romance Simplified,"The theme Jane Austen has in Emma aims to explore the psyche of an adolescent teenager who is past the blush of being a child, but could not cope with the traumas brought on by the war. It explores the emptiness of being without a mother, and at the same time the writer must be writing from the perspective of a young person who knew all the right things to say but coming out short. Essentially, Emma wishes to be the person who has given her birth, but is left alone with her ""peacock-personality type"" father who was constantly jealous of her mother's friendship while living. Her father could not survive the lost of her mother again, but at the same time, knowing this allows her to marry Emma to marry off Mr. Knightley, an equally jealous ""peacock"" man who would again retell the tale of her mother's marriage."
2,Poor KINDLE edition,"I'm writing in reference to the Kindle version of this book. Since I like the book itself, I gave 2 stars; however, this version was lacking in extras. I was seriously disappointed to find no footnotes, no introduction, no nothing. Just the book pure and simple. To top it off, there were many instances of multiple words jammedtogetherlikethis. I wish the 'sample' had been available when I ordered it from my Kindle. I certainly would have chosen another one of the available editions."
3,Tiresome,"I guess I am an exception. I found the book, Emma, to be overly long and tiresome. The book focuses mostly on social calls between Emma and her neighbors and their dialogue. Emma is just so snobbish and aware of her high status that it was hard to find her likeable at first. I found myself liking her more towards the end of the book as she saw the error of her ways. I loved Pride and Prejudice...but this book just didn't really click with me."
2,It pains me to say this...,"As much as I love Jane Austen, Emma is a horrible read. This was the only one of Austen's books I couldn't finish in college. I thought I'd try it again a decade later and I still don't like it (although this time I did finish reading it).Like some of the other reviewers have stated, Emma is just not a likeable character. And unlike most of Austen's heroines, she seems to have no redeeming qualities, making it incredibly hard to read about her for hundreds of pages.I guess one could argue that the book is well written by virtue of the fact that I despise Emma so much as a character. But I'm not arguing Austen's merits as a writer. I am simply stating that this book is not worth reading when there are so many other classics out there that you might actually enjoy!"
2,this book bored me. does that make me a bad person?,"the first chapter is a model of precision. in only nine pages, a handful of characters are introduced with masterful clarity. subtle dialouge paints a portrait of each character with a depth that many novelists never achieve over the course of hundreds of pages. jane austen's supreme talent is shining bright. then what happens? it goes on and on and on. and i got severely bored. i did not care about emma's social schemes, her obssession with ones rank within society. she is simply a dull character. and the language ultimately grows tiresome. the purple prose weighed heavy on my poor brain after a hundred pages. a bit beyond page 220 i jumped ship. i simply could not finish the book. sorry."
3,My least favorite Austen,"I love P&P, S&S and Mansfield Park, but I just did not care for Emma--primarily because of the title character. I'm not going to elaborate, b/c it is a Jane Austen and worth a read if only for that alone. Please read it and others and develop your own opinions on them."
2,Didn't like the paper quality and presentation,"I bought them (all the Barnes & Noble Classics) to complete my Jane Austen's collection, and honestly, didn't like the paper quality, it seems like they didn't even care for the presentation of them; it didn't look elegant, cheap to be more specific."
3,A classic revisited for my book club,"This old book sparked a lively discussion at my book club this month. Although the old English was a little difficult to wade through, we decided that we are really glad that times have changed and that finding a husband should not be a woman's total goal in life, and finding someone else a husband should be totally off limits."
2,Tough going,"Reading this novel was slow going. As a guy, I found the lack of action stultifying, and the flashes of humor were too quaint for me to derive any pleasure from them. The answer to the book's primary riddle--who shall Emma marry?--becomes obvious early on, and everything else is just a tedious pairing off until that riddle is expressly answered. There's a bit of local and historical color, but rarely does the narrative rise above the description of, say, a summer outing. Not one of Jane Austen's best."
2,Just OK,"The first 2 Jane Austen books I read were Pride and Prejudice and Sense and Sensibility. Both I considered excellent books, Pride and Prejudice being my favorite. I had high hopes of Emma, considering it had been made into the modern movie ""Clueless"". However, I have found this book very tiresome and it took me a long time to trudge my way through it. It may be the fact that I didn't like the main character as I had in the other books, but this book really went by slowly. It wasn't that bad of a story and really deserves 2 1/2 stars instead of the given 2 stars, but thats not an option. I would still recommend people to read the book for the good plot behind slow movement and seeing this prideful heroine transformed into a more likeable person."
3,Rated and why,"I gave this book a 3 out of 5 because, I am not into these kind of books. I kind of liked it and I kind of didn't like it."
3,QUESTION ON THIS BOOK>>>>>IS IT CONSIDERED A >>>A R BOOK>>>>,IS THIS BOOK>>>>>>CONSIDERED an......AR rated book.??...
2,Painfull...,"Emma Is a bad book, fact. The only thing that gives it any value is the quality of the writing. The book is unbelievably drawn out. I fell asleep many times whilst trying to finish this book. Don't think that i don't understand the plot or that or don't appreciate good litrature. In fact i read the book twice and was forced to study it for two years. Anybody who likes this book is very sad because it is just the unremarkable section of some unremarkable people's lives. As a result your life would have to be extremely tedious and boring for you to enjoy this waste of good paper."
1,hated it,"From the first sentence painfully spelling out Emma's character, this book has many problems. The characterizations are awkward, the plot contrived, and the prose is so roughly handled it makes a reader queasy. Pride and Prejudice at least had a little humor in it, but ""Emma"" has no redeeming qualities. I don't recommend spending your time on this one."
4,A story about love that transcends time.,"To put it simply, this is a story about love in various forms and degrees. The most important thing about love and relationships, however, is that no one can control who a person does and does not love. It's entertaining to follow Emma Woodhouse as she tries to play matchmaker, thinking that she knows best, and in the end she even surprises herself. You could update the time period and everything is still completely applicable in today's world.Aside from the story, I should also like to note that the formatting of this story is fantastic on the Kindle, unlike some of the other Austen novels I'm reading (Pride & Prejudice's formatting is not as smooth)."
5,Great regency novel,"Emma is a favorite in our house, and it's great to have the text in a free Kindle edition. Thanks."
5,"Please...it is Jane Austen, what isn't to love?","Jane Austen is one of my favorite authors and I'm tickled my oldest daughter also loves her novels. I prefer paper books, but nothing beats a Kindle loaded with amazing books when you are traveling and don't want to carry the bulky dead tree editions."
4,Emma,"Emma is probably me favorite book by Jane Austin. I do not want to give away anything, but you must get to know this wonderful girl."
4,emma,"Emma is not such an easy read. The plot is enough to cure anyone's insomnia.But if you really think about it you can get alot out of it about human character. Funny enough Austen never married as Emma planned to never marry and both for the same reason. They wan't to stay and take care of their fathers.I particulary liked the character Miss Bates. She was a very realistic character. Where ever you go there will always be a Miss Bates and a Miss Fairfax. Well, the book was certainly worth reading."
4,Romance is Nuts!,This book is well-written for a love story. The outcome fits the story line perfectly. Jane Austen does a good job on having Emma manipulate peoples lives so they fall in love with one another. Then Austen has Emma going hay-wire because of her mixed feelings and she kind of gets a taste of her own medicine. Her love set ups are not going as she had planned. Then everything hits her all at once. I love it! I would recommend this book is great if you like romance and all of the mushy stuff. Jane Austen did it again.
1,PRUNELLA SCALES NO HEIGHTS,"I've always been a fan of the British actress Prunella Scales and already own some of her readings of classic novels, including Cranford which she handles delightfully.So it was a big disappointment to find that she seems to have completely misjudged her narration of Emma. One of the pleasures of a Jane Austen novel is the author's deceptively quiet tone; its very understatement sharpens her satire and makes her jokes even funnier. Unfortunately, Miss Scales has adopted the opposite approach, using a hopelessly inappropriate shrill, impatient voice. Given that the opening chapters are dominated by two of literature's most tiresome characters, Emma Woodhouse and her feebleminded father, the result is unbearably irritating. I gave up after an hour, and was glad to track down a far more enjoyable reading by Juliet StevensonEmma (Classic Fiction)- by far the best Austen narrator on the market today."
3,Slow going but worth the read,"Had this story been written in a more contemporary style, my review would have been totally favorable. I found the story to be quite sweet, with great characters and a wholesome storyline.Unfortunately, this particular style of writing for me, as a fourteen year old, was a tad daunting. I found it slow, with way too many words and descriptions. I found myself often wishing she would just get to the point.I would have awarded more stars if it wasn't so difficult for me to get through."
2,Thank God Somebody Else Likes This,"If no one else liked this book, I would be responsible for keeping it a classic. I couldn't. As for the plot, I think it goes something like this -- they talk, they talk, they talk, then they shut up, and the book is over."
1,Don't waste your time or money,"I bought this book because my book group had chosen it for a ""classic"" read. I can't imagine why anyone would waste their time and money on this book. I could barely get through the first 50 pages or so until I gave up on it. As far as I'm concerned, the characters were worthless and their activities were pointless. Why anyone still reads Jane Austen is beyond me. If this book is an example of her writing, it is terrible! People in my book group said her other works are better but I won't be reading them."
1,Poor Condition,"This book is VERY poor condition. The pages are uneven and look like they were cut when the blade needed changing or sharpening or cut with too many at once.I am returning it to Amazon, the only good thing is that I bought it with Amazon, they are paying for return shipping. I have to say that I am very pleased with Amazon's CS. I am a frequent customer and will continue to be."
3,classic,"It was a good book, but older writing styles are hard for me to get used to. I liked the characters, but the movie ruined it for me. ALWAYS read the book before you see the movie."
3,A classic still holds up,"This is the original. Everyone knows the story so well, it is hard to read and keep in mind how many other stories and movies it spawned. If you have read it before, it is worth reading again. If you have not read, you must take time to read."
2,Not my type of story,"I thought I would enjoy this book because I like the author but I had a hard time getting into it. Others may like it, it just wasn't one for me."
2,"Extreamly Dull, If Anything!!!!!","I am 11 and a 1/2 years old and simple love books that take place in Europe in the 1700 or 1800's. However, this book was absolutly boring. Out of all of Austens works, which are not all to exciting themselves, this has to be the most boring and drawn out. There are long pauses of nothing but tea and long walks, and once in a while Emma will set up one of her friends. This match does not last long, however. Personaly if I were her ""friend"" Harriet, I would think myself better off without her companionship. To my knowledge Jane Austen wrote this ""little gem"" for the prince of England whom she did not exactly admire. I wouldn't be surprized if his didn't admire her so much after he finished reading it. If you are looking for a exciting and gripping book do not choose Emma."
1,Doesn't survive the test of time,"I endured through the entire audiobook because I finish what I start but this book had very little interest for me. First I think it's a chick book, one that women would find more interesting, second it's about a spoiled brat that thinks herself the world, with which most readers will not sympathize. Maybe the book was great in the time when it was published, but the style does not suit me for these reasons. The setting was not interesting for me: 18th century England in the countryside where nothing happens, where propriety is more important that authenticity and passion. The climax of the novel, like the contemporary English culture, is all too subtle for my taste and like the rest of the book lacks the drama that I expected from this supposed classic. In short I think other great books have lasted the test of time but this is certainly not one of them. It too easily loses your attention."
1,No classic in my mind,"After reading Emma by Jane Austin I am very much considering not reading another book by Jane Austen.I was very dissapoited with the book. I am new to readint ""the classics"" and after looking at several ""classic"" reading lists found this book to be on several. I decided to read the book and even completed it against my better judgement. I found the book extremely boring and would not recomend it to anyone outside of maybe teenage girls."
2,I love Jane Austen but.....,"I absolutely loved Pride and Prejudice, and Sense and Sensibility, but I found Emma to be pretty boring. It's not that I didn't like the story- I did, but it was such a tedious thing to read. Anyone who read this book before Austen's others would be turned off. I would not recommend it."
4,rating,"always enjoy a good jane austen for a quick, easy and wholesome read. i just wanted to rate it. done"
4,good read,"I remember watching the movie. The book is always better, lots more detail. I would recommend this to most anyone who likes the genre."
3,Emma,"I found Emma to be a pretty good book. However, for me it seemed to take to long for them to actually say anything & get to the point."
4,Austen's novel is a timeless classic.,"Jane Austen's novel Emma is the story of a young woman who at first seems to be self-indulgent and egotistical. As the novel progresses, however, the reader finds the girl more than willing to postpone her own ambitions for romance in order to further the happiness of others. The book takes an ironic turn when Emma finds love with Mr. Knightley despite the fact that the entire novel focuses on her matchmaking efforts for others. Overall, I find this book to be a light-hearted love story and a refreshing change from many serious novels of the Victorian period."
4,Pretty good.,"A little dragging at first, but now I wouldn't have it any other way. Emma was hard to sympathize with in the begining. She is naive, snobbish and presumptuous. By the end, however, I was praying for her and Knightley to get together. Austen is witty as usual. She is a wonderful narrator. You might wanna check out Pride and Prejudice, which I loved. Her writing is Romantic though, so if that's not your thing, you should think twice before picking up an Austen. She may be wordy, but her writing is by no means difficult to read."
4,Jane Austen book Lover,"I love this book, it is a fun must read if you love Jane Austen's writing. Unfortunately I had to get a refund for my dover thrift addition Emma book because it had a printing defect. I love the dover thrift addition books because they are a great sized print and and easy to read and hold. I would still recommend this product to friend even though mine had a defect I have bought many other dover thrift addition books with no problem."
5,Great Service,I was very impressed by the response time and professionalism of the seller. I would definitely buy again from this seller and appreciate someone that takes online purchases seriously.
5,"This was a wonderful book, no matter what others say!","This book was wonderfully uplifting and entertaining. I enjoyed it immensely, and I believe you will as well, if you like amusing stories dealing with romance, confusion, friendship, matchmaking, and true love. Do not listen to some of the other reviews that say this book is a rip-off of Clueless. Obviously the people who posted those are incredibly ignorant, especially since Emma came out a very long time before Clueless, and if anyone was eligible to sue, it would be Jane Austen (if she was still alive) suing the makers of Clueless. Again, this was a very enjoyable book, and I would definately recommend it to anybody!"
4,review for emma,"I felt that Emma was a great book and an informative look into the past, when it was written around 1815. It was interesting to read how everyone called the other Mr., Miss, or Mrs. It was a little confusing because of this, because, for example, there is a Miss Bates and a Mrs. Bates, and sometimes it's hard to remember which is which!The story is a good one, a great novel that pulls you in, but with lengthy descriptions, and once in awhile it drags. Throughout the story, my 21st century ""hurry up"" mode would prefer it to move along more quickly.The storyline, similarly, is also a bit slow at times, but it's a wonderful romantic novel with a human character like Emma. She has flaws, but is enchanting, as are the rest of the characters in the book. it's also very humorous and has a great ironic twist. I definitely recommend it, but to at least a freshman in high school, because it is a challenging book."
5,Austen Lover,"""EMMA"" may very well be my favorite Austen novel :) ""PERSUASION"" may be a close second, or possibly a tie for first!Jane Austen was so witty and engaging. I really come to care about her characters. It may be harder to read for someone who doesn't enjoy the language of period pieces.The social structure is also sometimes hard to stomach!AND, I might add, that anytime a classic is ""free"" for kindle, you should at least give it a try! How easy it has become to be ""well read""!!"
1,Indypublish.com edition is a flimsy computer printout,"The name of the publisher should have clued me in to the fact that this edition is only an imitation of a real children's book. Perkins' original book was charmingly illustrated; this has no illustrations at all. This is disorienting as well as disappointing, since even the first line of the text refers to an illustration. The lack of illustrations greatly reduces its appeal to younger children. The edition is flimsily bound, and closely resembles a manual that might come with your new Kenmore washer."
3,No illustrations!,"I recently read that this was Beverly Cleary's first favorite book (she wrote the Ramona books), that this is the one that opened her world to the joy of reading, and I'm certain that had a lot to do with text PLUS illustrations! But these reprints have no interior illustrations?!!! There's a Google books online version, from an early edition that is just packed with the sweetest drawings! I wanted to get my kids a copy, as they are 5 and 6 yrs old and still not quite reading...so I guess it's to Alibris I'll go. Thanks again for the warning Alice!"
5,Excellent and arrived earlier than stated,"My son and I just received the bokken set and are quite pleased with them. They are well made and very well balanced. Better then most that I have had over the years. So far they are holding up nicely to impacts, though we really aren't trying to hit them very hard as we purchased them for Kata practice. The black finish is excellent which does make it heavier than the natural one. The guard fits tightly on both and needed no glue to hold it in place. Our order was shipped the day after we ordered it and it arrived a day earlier than stated. They were well wrapped to protect them and the box arrived with no damage. I will be purchasing more from them in the future as long as their quality maintains at this level."
3,Eh..,"Well for th price its a good buy but when it comes to sturdiness the black one has alot to be desired exspecialy after breaking after only 2 days of use, how ever the natural one is pretty sturdy so i'd sugest buying at your own risk."
4,I got 2 black swords.,"Although I was expecting one black and one brown sword, I got 2 black ones. It doesn't matter in the long run. I was just expecting one of each. Everything else about them is as expected."
4,pratice swords,these are very good swords and fun to play with my brother and i got one each and we fight a lot. the paint from the black one is rubbing off onto the brown one. but other then that great swords. a lot of fun.
3,"Good for display, not for fighting","I am overall content with this purchase. cheap and quick shipping, it seemed like a great idea. Only tofind out if you smack these together at all they will break quickly. within 2 swings the bottom of the handle had already cracked in half, and the last time i used it, the sword actually broke in half and almost hit me in the face! I did not expect that.So great for hanging or for light messing around, but dont plan on even moderately messing around with these"
4,Electronic Funny Stuff,I enjoy the casio beats and smooth lyrical genious. I wish amazon would sell this cd again. It is well worth it.
4,The most powerful and saddest moment in cinema I've seen.,Ignore the review from the Middle East(below). This film has nothing to do with Chinese love partners. The review from Prague is correct. It's an amazing film about the depths that love can ascend or sink to (depending on your point of view).
5,A REAL love story,"What is *real* love? In this film, it means: 1. the willingness to let yourself be killed by and for the person you love, and 2. the willingness to kill a person (that you once loved) for the person that you now love. Altogether a brilliant and arresting concept of love...utterly at odds with the usual kitschy notions of love.Why oh why, can't Hollywood make such startlingly original, beautiful and haunting love-stories like this, instead of ""Pretty Woman"" and its ilk?"
5,Obsession or Love?,This is an unusual film about a man who gets out of the service and begins to look for a job. His girlfriend Trini recommends a landlady Luisa to him. He rents her room and trouble begins. He has difficulty making up his mind what and who he wants. Same goes for both Luisa and Trini. See this film!
4,Touching,"Ignore the Middle Eastern comment below; he got this movie confused with ""The Lover"", a French movie starring Jane March. ""Lovers"" is is a good movie. How could one be so possesive, so confused, and so tragic. The main characters were played excellently."
2,Pointless...,"Obviously, the only reason Disney had for making this movie was to test their newly created CAPS animation system, because other than a few impressive uses of that, this forgettable sequel has nothing more to offer. While The Rescuers remains one of the studios most beloved animated, this one simply falls way back being one of the most uninteresting and bland Disney releases of all time."
1,A disgrace to both original film and Margery Sharp!,"This Disney sequel, ""inspired by characters created by Margery Sharp"" totally rips the appeal of the original novels and the original Disney animated classic. This sequel hardly captures Sharp's world, it only offers the same title characters but those have become probably the most boring characters in the film. The whole thing has turned into a modern day ""adventure."" I really don't have much to say about the plot other than it seems to me as a remake of the first film.Even though the first film twisted Sharp's world a lot, it was still a fine piece of beautiful animation and smart storytelling. This sequel has nothing especial and has no heart. Skip it. There are better films out there. Too bad for Bernard and Bianca, though... Disney has once again managed to ruin a classic with a dumb sequel! Shame on you!"
1,bernard and miss bianca should have died,"i would have loved that. The movie is stupid, its boring. plus there were too many dirty jokes :("
3,Not for US devices,"Classic movie, and I enjoyed it as much as I did when I watched it as a kid.However, this DVD is not formatted for US devices, and this is not specified when you order it."
4,decent sequel,"The first Rescuers was a really good film, and this one is not QUITE as good, but it is sitll a pretty good sequel with an enjoyable story that is set in Australia with a convincing villain."
2,Disappointing,"Weak structure, underdeveloped and even annoying characters, silly dialog, and a few hard-to-swallow action scenes (even for cartoons) make this far worse than the first. The animation is kind of nice but doesn't make up for the basic shortcomings in story, plot, and characters."
1,"The Rescuers Down Under (1990) ""IMPORT ONLY""","Yes, thats what the title should say. region 2 dont work in the USA. this product is deceitful. Shame on vendors selling this product."
1,Rescuers,DVD did not work. Still trying to figure out how to get my money back. If you can help let me know. Thanks
1,Miss Bianca! What have they done to you?!,"Eek! Eek! Eek! This is absolutely the worst movie experience I've had in weeks. Horrid adaptation of Margery Sharp's novels, not only that, but a total failure as a film on its own! There's just no point to this movie. Where the first one ended should have been the end. Nothing happens here that relates to the first movie, there was no need for it at all!But to have Miss Bianca and Bernard marry?! That's like shooting Margery Sharp! She would never have allowed such atrocity!! What were the film makers thinking?! Turning Margery Sharp's soft, warm and sophisticated novels into an action, cliché romance film...? Makes you want to throw up!Totally disgusted!!"
5,The Rescurers Down Under,"My five year old grandaughter really got into this book. I think this was much better than the original""The Rescurers"". It teaches children to respect animals."
2,Ok,"It wasn't too bad, it's nowhere as near as good as the first one but it isn't completely terrible. Good for rainy day watching, kids will like it, the first one holds up better for adults. Only real complaint is that the characters are sort of dull."
4,Well made and long awaited sequel,"Great computeranimation, a good voicecast, unforgettable characters, and lot of action and humor saves this overlooked Disney sequel, that seems to get more popular, as it's released on DVD.Bernard and Bianca must travel to the wilderness in Australia, to save the boy Cody, and the eagle Marahute from the flamboyant villian McLeach, and his clumsy sidekick, the iguana Joanna, and they get help from the kangaroo-mouse Jake."
2,Came quick... not in best quality though,The clip inside the case was broken... which resulted in a cd that flopped around in the case and scratched it up. It still played thankfully but would have been nice to have a fully functional case.
5,DVD movie,"This was a gift for my granddaughter. The movie arrived inpristine shape and very quickly. She loved the movie. Funny,her daddy did too at the same age. Some movies are ""timeless.""This is one of them.Would recommend the seller."
1,Absurd!,"The mice don't even act like mice on this one, it shows how much time was put into the making of it. A few flat looking flight scenes can't make up for poor story telling."
1,If you live in the US don't buy DVDs from this seller!!,I do a lot of my amazon purchasing on my iPhone. For some reason I was not informed that I was buying a DVD that would not work in any american devices. I tried to return the item but was told I would have to pay for shipping from US to UK... More then the price of the DVD
5,cave twins review from grandkids.,"Or rather my Granddaughters love it. Recommended to them by Grandma who has fond memories of reading it when she was their age. The feedback from Heidi ( to whom it was sent ) was "" Wow Wicked Brilliant !"""
4,Vintage Teletubbies!,Great episodes and fun stories! Don't miss this title if you are a collector or a fan. Very sweet message wrapped up in classic Teletubbie cuteness.
3,Cute,"This is one of our favorite Teletubbies videos! You won't be able to get ""Wake Up Wake Up"" out of your head. It's an adorable segment where children wake up their drowsy caregiver. Another memorable number has a live swing band singing ""Hey Diddle Diddle"" out in the field while children dance around. Your little ones will love it!"
1,Teletubbies bedtime stories and nursery rhymes,I am not sure why they say this is not published yet because I purchased this for my 2 yr.old son for Christmas 2000. I do not recommend this video at all. It only makes my son wilder at bedtime. There is no routine for bedtime and it is always daylight during the video and the other teletubbies just laugh. I laughed at myself for buying it.
1,I have not recieve it yet,I have not recieve it yet.It have been 30 days and i have not recieve it yet.I dont know what to do

4,home inspection,"great book for beginer, home inspectors or buyers.easy to understand and has some pictures to campare and understand better.iv done home maintenance for a living for 6 years and i use the checkpoints, and look to this book when looking at houses."
2,Incorrect information in this book,I don't recommend this book due to many incorrect observations and information noted in the chapters. I was very surprised that this book was recommended by other readers because there were many mistakes and errors in the book. Some important topics were discussed incorrectly and others were too brief. To find out and confirm this I gave this book to several local real estate contractors and they pointed out many other errors in this book that even I was unaware of. They explained to me how many things discussed in the book were outdated or not relevant.
2,Negative review - too basic and not too helpful,"The only time I would write a negative review if I think a book has been over rated. This book is definitely over rated. My husband and I are real estate investors and continually read books to improve our profits. We both felt this book was too basic and we did not get helpful information. We go to monthly meetings for investors in our county and this is one of the books on the ""don't buy"" list on our bulletin board!"
1,Errors Noted In The Content,There are incorrect items written about in a number of the topics discussed in this book. When you buy a book you want to know you paid for correct advice and information. Some items were helpful but I wonder how many other issues are wrong that I didn't check into further.
2,Information on shaky ground,"Some information in this book is good, however much appears on ""shaky"" ground. A few items are not accurate. I regret purchasing the book."
5,"A ""MUST READ"" for all Home Inspectors!",This book is the premiere reference book for new Home Inspectors. The authors' knowledge is based on thousands of inspections. The layout and style of the book make it very easy to read and reference. There is a lifetime worth of valuable home inspection information at a very reasonable cost. MUST READ
2,Lacking a lot for home inspectors,There are a lot of areas that home inspectors need to know that are not mentioned. If you know nothing about inspections then you could learn a few pointers from this book. If you have some knowledge already then there are other books that would be a much better choice than this one. Some areas in the book were wrong. I would read the other books in this field before buying this one.
4,Great guide for home-buyers and those considering a Home Inspection career,"This third edition of the book contains a lot of information for would be home buyers, whom the author claims is his target audience. I definitely wish I had read it before I bought my first house. It'll help you evaluate the condition of items from your roof down to your crawl space or basement and everything in between. It is written in an easy-to-understand format and is well organized so you can find exactly what you are looking for.I am studying to become a home inspector myself and found this book to be a very useful first step. The North Carolina Home Inspection licensing bureau still pulls quite a few questions for their licensing test from this edition of the book."
4,BOOK OF HOME INSPECTION,"It was very informative! It is good to have a book like this ,that way if you ever buyanother home,you will know what is going on when they inspect your home!"
1,This book did not teach me anything I didn't already know,If you are looking for a book that will teach you a lot about real estate and home inspections then this is not the book for you. The chapter information and text content of this book was very basic and did not teach me anything I didn't already learn from other books that were much better. Inspecting homes is something I have done for many years and I would not recommend this book to any customers or contractors. If you know absolutely nothing about real estate then you might learn a few things but not too much.
2,Not a good reference book for home inspectors.,We have a home inspection business and I read many books on real estate topics. This book was OK but certainly not worth recommending to our inspection clients. Some of the topics discussed are irrelevant to home inspections - such as mold! There were many topics lacking in the amount of information the author provided. Maybe if you don't know anything about houses or construction you might learn a little bit from this book. If you have a novice level of knowledge about house inspections then you should buy a different book since this book won't teach you anything new.
4,"Good, Basic Starter","For a new home owner or home inspector, this book is a good, basic book that even a lay person can understand (one that has no knowledge of the field). It's obvious the author, has many years of experience and designed the book in the order that he would inspect a home. I highly recommend this for someone starting out in the business as a reference book."
4,An excellent book for the first time home buyer.,"This book thoroughly walks the reader through the home inspection procedure in a step-by-step fashion. It is definitely worth buying and reading. Some chapters, such as the one on wood-destroying insects, have much detail. Others have a bit less detail and would benefit from additional illustrations and text. The author focuses on safety and cost considerations in performing home inspections. Sometimes he is a little puritanical in championing safety considerations first, but it's hard to knock that. He gives many useful tips to the novice home inspector, for example on how to check septic systems for proper function. I've read this book once over and have reread some chapters. It deserves careful study of the individual chapters. I intend to carry the book with me when I look through prospective houses."
4,Ironman Stretch Mat,"I enjoy using this mat for daily crunches and other on-the-floor exercises, not only because it works for it's intended function, but it is light and easy to store, plus the edges always lie flat as opposed to staying curled like those other rolled-up mats. The only reason I took away one star is the very strong solvent-y smell this mat gave off when it arrived. I set it outdoors on my porch in a airy, but sheltered spot and forgot about it for a few weeks. When i finally remembered to bring it back inside, it no longer gave off any odor whatsoever and hasn't since. PS It does measure 1/4 inch thick as described..I have posted a photo of the thickness."
1,Garbage - Avoid,The dimensions indicate 1/4 inch which would be fine except it is apparently the FOLDED dimension. Give me a break!
5,Awesome Game of strategy,"My 5 year old grandson absolutely loved this game and didn't want to stop playing. I thought it was great because we worked as a team to beat the cat. It wasn't about winning as an individual, but winning for the critters so the cat wouldn't catch and eat them. It was great fun to watch my grandson think through what he should do next in order for the critters to get home safely. I would highly recommend it for children ages 4 to 10."
5,Great game!!!!,Our kids grew up with this game and always loved it. We plan on keeping it for our next generation. Now I am getting it for another family to be able to enjoy in the same way.
5,A great series for early language acquisition,"I have been using this entire series with my son since he was born, and he is now 14 months. He loves the pictures and turning the pages. The books use the format of one word per page and it gives both the English and Spanish form of the word. This is a great series for early language acquisition."
2,freely available,"Since those responsible for this animated version of ""Animal Farm"" failed to renew their copyright (this came out in 1954), this film is now freely available, for example on YouTube, where it can be legally uploaded in its entirety.It follows the book much more than the recent version did, although still very loosely. The biggest difference is its completely different, more hopeful ending."
3,Liked it,"It was okay, but it could have had more elaboration creativity and story to it. Why do they want 60 dollars for it?????"
1,Horrible transfer,This tape is recorded in SLP mode (the worst VHS). The colors are extremely grainy and the reds almost unwatchable. The scenes inside the farm that are at night have more noise than visual image. This is among the very worst possible transfers of this material. This should definately not be bought by anyone.
5,A Prophetic Film -- 35 Years Ahead Of It's Time,"This film should be required viewing in every high school or college in America. Aside from being one of the first animated British feature films, as a poignant parable, it so perfectly explains how the Russian Revolution turned a bad situation into one of the three worst of the 20th century (the others being Nazi Germany and Communist China). Reviewers harping on the film's ""upbeat"" ending sound unaware of just how prophetic that ending turned out to be (remember what happened to Soviet Communism in 1989). This is a great film which -- incredibly -- may have now slipped into the public domain. (...)"
1,A Waste of Time,"I think this is the same version of 'Animal Farm' I saw that completely changed the ending of the book. This version actually makes a happy ending out of the story! A complete waste of time, and ruined the uncomprimising messages of the book. Read the book."
2,This is poisonus; I wannada givit 1 starr butt i wuz dummy,"This is atrocus, vile, terribul, moron, poisonus, idiot, doodoo, and funky-bunky. I think it wuz bad. I wannada givit 1 starr but my bro didunt let me."
1,This was really stupid.,"Animal Farm is a satire of a tyranical/Communist government. Even though it has animals as the main characters, it isn't for children. Apparently, the filmmakers did not realize it, and turned this brilliant novel into a cutesy, Disney-esque cartoon. It was just really, really bad."
1,Nothing like the book.,"This adaptation of George Orwell's brilliant satire has lost all the meaning. If you've read the book, don't see the movie. If you haven't read the book, still don't see the movie."
1,Comic movie ruins true views on Russian Communism,"Not only is this drawn spoof of animal farm disgusting, They cut out half of the book, and to top it all off change the ending! Please read the book, don't even waste your time."
1,Dumb,"I thought this movie was dumb. There was one good part, though. I thought that the theme came out nicely as the horse turned into glue."
5,Then and Now,"I have never seen the movie before (the review is more for the book since I didn't see the movie), but I read the book. Before you can read the reviews, you must remember that this book was written during the Age of Communism, and the movie also set during the Age of Communism. So, before reading or watching Animal Farm, just remember.....the book and movie take place in the past, and that is how they should be watched/read."
2,Animal Farm,"When I read the book ""animal farm"" i thought there could be nothing in the world more moronic or overrated. Then I saw the movie and was proven wrong."
2,"Not bad, but...",this in an uninspired telling of a transparent political fable. Good enough to watch once.
1,TRUTH,this film was funded by the centeral intelligence agency in the 1950s and was maipulated to suit the need of a capitalistic propoganda machine
3,Orwell wouldnt of liked it,"George Orwell would not of like watching his book Animal Farm, in this cartoon adaptation, there is no political parrallel, nor deeper meaning, but a bunch of cartoon figures running around, it show's how authors like Sam Bald, and George Orwell, made their language put images in your head, anyway stick to the book"
3,A Powerful Cartoon,"Animal Farm, based on a novel by George Orwell, is ostensibly about a group of animals who rebel against the drunken farmer who owns them, and abuses them. They begin running the farm themselves. Their revolution is corrupted into tyranny which eventually becomes worse than the human farmer's regime.A not-so-veiled criticism of totalitarianism under Stalin, many events portrayed in the DVD correspond to real events that took place in the Soviet Union.If there's one thing wrong with this film, it's the ending. Orwell wrote an ending that was biting and necessary. By giving the film an upbeat ending, it somewhat undermines a first rate film. But I can't ignore the power of the previous 73 minutes, so I'm still recommending it."
3,Pages missing...,"Excellent book to read daily as a spiritual form of uplift and internal house-cleaning.My edition ABUNDANT LIVING Copyright, MCMXLII By Whitmore & Stone has pages 212 thru 245 missing and they have not been removed or fallen out accidentally.I suspect all editions are similar. Might someone confirm this who has a copy?I would love to get a photocopy of these pages if possible."
5,Abundant living,A quintessential E. Stanley Jones daily/weekly devotional suitable for all believers wishing to strengthen their walk. Mr. Jones has an excellent way with words that causes the reader to yearn for more.
4,El Condor Pasa,"The Music is very good. Not exactly the one I was looking for, however, very nice to listen to."
1,For absolute beginners only,"If you have any knowledge of Spanish vocabulary, do not buy this CD. This is VERY VERY basic, with greetings (ola, como esta, buenos dias, etc), very simple phrases, very simple words. For someone who knows NO Spanish, this might be helpful, but not to anyone else. In addition, the CD is very short, and more than half of my CD skips, making it shorter still. I was very disappointed and feel I wasted my money."
5,"Awsome learning aid, great format, clearly spoken.","This CD travels with me from car to home to work. I enjoy the format and timing. I hope they followup with a quiz CD that says the word in spanish and allows you responce time, then immediately says the same spanish word and the english word and it is catagorized like this CD is."
4,Great program management book for the novice!,"This book gives a great understanding of what to expect and how to react to programming software projects. Although not set up for the Web world, the book still offers good insight on the dos and don'ts of software management."
5,Egermeier's Bible Story Book,"When I was little, my dad used to read this book to me every night before I went to sleep...I enjoyed it very much! I wanted the same for my grandson, so I bought this for him...It is wonderful! Just the same as I remember! I'm happy that I bought it for him."
5,Classic Bible Story Book,"Excellent Bible Story book for cildren over 8. Our church gives a copy to each family with children. Only negative, a few extra textual comments that fill in the story line nicely but are not in Scripture."
5,One of my favorites from childhood.,This book is fine for any age that would like to learn Bible history. The stories go from creation to the early church. Children like the stories that follow the Bible very closely and adults get a great over view of Bible History...now it is easy to know when the divided kingdom started and who were the kings of Judah and the North and when the different prophets had their time of ministry.
5,Excellent,The stories are well written covering the major points and simplifying the story to captivate and hold the young reader.
5,my son's favorite and MORE,This was my son's favorite book for many years. He now reads it to our grandchildren - his neices! We run a full-blown preschool with an average of 110 children each year and I read it to each class every year and they all LOVE it. I lost our copy at the preschool and NEED another one so I'm buying a second one. WE LOVE THIS BOOK!
2,It makes me wonder...,"I bought this book for my nephew, and read it to him one night while babysitting.We were through nine pages when he told me to stop.In his words, this story is ""dumber than Teletubbies.""I did some research on the author and I found some wonderful photographs he made.Writing doesn't seem to be his best talent. I wouldn't buy this book to use as a coaster. I would use some of his photos, though."
3,EHHH...SO-SO.,"I OWN THIS AND WOULD SAY IT'S PRETTY GOOD - WORTHY OF PURCHASE. I'M GLAD I GOT IT BECAUSE THERE'S JUST NOT A LOT OF HARD NRG OUT AND THERE IS A COUPLE/FEW REAL GOOD TRACKS BUT FOR AS MANY TRACKS AS THERE ARE, THERE SHOULD BE MORE. LIKELY, IT WILL NOT BE YOUR FAVORITE C.D."
3,YIKES!,"Okay, let me start off by saying I love animals especially cats, so when I found a children's book about them, I thought hey, this might be fun to read. When I finished book one, I began to wonder if I should read the others. I am not a wimp, except when it comes to animals getting hurt (having wittnessed a dog/cat attack, which still gives me nightmares) I had some serious doubts about continuing with this series. But I sucked it up and went on to read book two. As I finished that one I remembered the line that the little boy said to his grandfather in 'Princess Bride: Jesus, Grandpa! What did you read me this thing for?'. I commend those of you who can read these books and enjoy them, I however find them what what...dispiriting."
3,Not 100 o/o happy,"Though my daughter was thrilled to get this book for her collection, I have to say I was slightly disappointed. The cover of the book was very badly damaged! I have bought books at 2nd hand stores that were in MUCH better shape."
3,Warriors: Into the Wild,"This book absolutely does not deserve 5 stars. While I had a great time reading it, while it was well written, and while I was unable to put it down for 3 hours straight, it simply does not deserve that high of a rating.There are two major flaws to this book: the Cheese factor and the Weirdness factor. The Cheese factor is very high on this book, simply meaning that it is a light-hearted, entertaining romp that is at first spellbinding, but after a while fades into cheesiness.The second factor is definitely the more serious one: the Weirdness factor. In this case, the Weirdness level is off the scale. I'm not arguing the book was stupid, but most people are hesitant to sit through 288 pages of kitty warfare. The whole concept is far from creative and crosses into the bizarre zone.Warriors: Into the Wild is a good light read, but relies on a secularism that will leave readers puzzled."
5,One amazing book!,"I love this book. I could not stop reading! At one point I read 80 some odd pages. Man if it was my choice make more books especailly about RIVERCLAN! Please,I beg of it! I mean Thunderclan's cool but seriously. The book get's scary. JUST AMAZING!"
5,Great Book!!!,"I think that this is a very good, thought out book. When I first saw it in the book store I was sort of interested in it but I didn't get it. I thought about it for awhile and the next time I came back I decided to just buy it and give it a try. I am glad that I did because it is turning out to be better than I thought and I can't for the next book!!!"
5,Best book ever!,I read this book in 1st grade and I still like it now! As soon as I read this book my favorite animal became a cat. I liked how Erin Hunter told the story from Rusty\Firepaw`s view.
5,love it!!!!!,could not stop reading until i had read them all i loved this book because it gave me a resonable idea of what my catcould be thinking my cat is dead now but i have 2 newborn kittens who love the out doors i just hope they do not go join a clan!!!!!
5,For Readers of all Ages.,"I started reading the Warriors series when I was about 11, and I was immediatly captivated. First off, I was searching desperatly for an animal-fantasy book, so this series was like a miracle. I started to read the book, and I couldn't stop. Each character is so interesting, and the chemistry between each was wonderful. I read the whole series as fast as I could. It's been two years, and I am still a faithful Warriors fan. The stories themselves have interesting plots that twist and turn in every direction. These are still some of my favorite books, even though I'm 13. These stories are a good pleaser for all ages."
5,A great book!!!,"This incredible journey will take you and Firepaw on an amazing adventure. This book is fun to read because Firepaw goes on so many different adventures. He starts out as a normal house pet and gets invited to a clan. This clan is called the Thunderclan. At first he is teased and insulted, but ends up as a great warrior. You will never ever want to stop reading this incredible journey!!"
5,Amazing!,A adventurous and heart warming book that will keep you glued! If you love cats and clan loyalty you'll love this book
5,I love cats,This book is amazing I can't wait to get the 2nd book I love firepaws New name fireheart is the perfect name for him I give this book......................5 stars hands down I love your work Erin Hunter
5,5 stars hands-down!,"i love this book! when i bought it, i never put it down! and i really agree with the review before me...it really is almost like harry potter! of course..what beats harry potter?..though this series keeps the fantasy world of books with a fresh story. erin hunter.......keep on writing!"
4,Read it,"Even though I am ten, I still enjoy reading long books.Every time I read this book New movies flash in my mind, like Erin said, I wonder what lerks inside my four house cats.Erin Hunter inspired me to become in love with cats, to learn more about cats,to become a writer, and to become closer to cats."
2,Great book,It's great for kids 9+ it has a great moments in it . If you like cats u will love this book
5,My daughter devoured these!,Excellent series of books for a pre-teen reader. My daughter has read all of these several times to where the bindings are starting to give out.
4,Not just a young adult/children's book,"Outstanding story. I first chose it because I like stories with cats, but soon got pulled into the life of Firepaw, Greypaw, and Ravenpaw, three apprentice warriers. This stoy could easily be set in a school or in politics or in a human community. Well written, moves right along, lots of emotion. I'm hooked on this series."
5,An Excellent Story for Adults as Well,"Let me start this review out by saying that I am 21 years old and I do read a good amount of ""adult fiction"". However, the child in me likes to delve back into books about animals on occasion to keep my book selections fresh. When I first picked this book up years ago, I was very worried that it would be too childish for me and I would get bored with it quickly. NOT THE CASE! Ha, I was very intrigued with this story and found that I couldn't even begin to put it down. I love the story of Rusty the house cat finding his true calling out with the wild cat clans. I've read almost every book in all the series and I'm telling you that they are definitely worth it!!! Very satisfied!!!"
4,A series that just gets better and better,"Warriors #1 Into the Wild is a great book. It's about this cat called Rusty that is owned by humans. He always dreams about catching mice in the forest. One day he goes out into the forest and runs into these forest cats. Then he decides to become a forest cat himself. A lot of older readers with he age 12 & up will think this book sounds stupid because of this review but it's now my favorite series of books. The first 2 books are confusing for everyone who who reads them. If you start wanting to quit the series because of these reasons, DO NOT QUIT! I just started Warriors #4 Power of Three and I'm soooooo addicted. If this review helps you, please respond."
5,i love this book,this is an amazing book with great action and is a pageturner with a great plot and lots of supense.
1,Awful writing!,"In full disclosure, I have not read more than a few pages here and there in any of the Warriors books. My 8 year old daughter absolutely loves them, but what little I have read when reading with her is just gawd-awful. Thank goodness she can read these by herself. I find it hard to believe the spectacular ratings these books have received here. I found the writing to be almost unbearable. The author uses the same few adjectives, verbs and adverbs over and over again, and she seems incapable of writing a sentence that does not contain the repetitive names of two or more cats. Has she never heard of pronouns? Maybe the story is compelling, I wouldn't know, but no story could be compelling enough to make me wade through this horrible writing. True, the target audience of these books is very young, but writing for a third-grader does not mean one has to write LIKE a third-grader."
2,Hmmm....,lots of hype and a lot of marketers on my favorite boards telling me to run out and buy......... Stupid me i did. It's some of the worst most juvinile writing ever. I'm 12 and I could nt stomach none of it.
1,To dissapointed for words,"A friend recommended me this book because I was a dog lover and she was a cat lover.... There are many reasons why this book was terrible, but i'll only say 3. 1: Books should be imaginative, but fights not only in this book, but in the WHOLE series are TO imaginative! 2: When Erin Hunter describes the way the cats feel like when they eat prey, it almost makes me sick, with blood being juicy and all that! 3:Yea, let the good guys win, bout' ALWAYS!!!!! Only in the BEGINNING of this book did i see a fight where the good guys lost, but throughout all the series prepare for the good guys to always win...Now, I'm not saying you CAN'T read this book, I'm saying if you DO read this book youll regret it...."
1,This is NOT a children's book!,"I picked this book up for my son, age 7, who likes cats. I was thinking that we could read it together. I started reading the book on my own to see what it was like. This book is NOT for young children. I don't want to have to explain to my son what at ""Cutter"" is and why cat's would be afraid of it. I don't think that young children should be hearing about the pleasure that cats (or any animals) get from a fresh kill. Those just aren't the types of things I want to introduce to him at his age. This book should really be targetted for older children (teenagers), not young readers. Besides the issue of the target audience, I do feel the writer does capture the feelings of cats as best as a human can capture an animals ""feelings"", but I also think that the writing is not particularly polished or engaging. I would not recommend this book."
2,bad...,not very very very very very very very very very very very good. I was very very very very very very very very very very very very very very very very disappointed with the quality of this book.
3,excellent,"i love this book i just think erin hunterbit off more than she can chew what with the new series of dog books, and the bear books,AND the warrior series in the end of the warrior series too much fighting and there wasnt as many details its as if erins too rushed to think about imagery"
2,A Children's Book,"I found this book to be too simple. Perhaps children would like it (I myself love animals), but it wasn't thought-provoking enough.The characters' names somehow bothered/annoyed me. I liked the idea of cats running about in clans, but I simply did not like their society, their family itself.Erin Hunter has a tendency to include far too many characters. The first Warriors book I picked up had an entire list of characters. A sort of dramatis personae (or felidae). Cats upon cats. Is it really so necessary to throw in so many characters?"
5,Calling All Cat Lovers,"I recommend this book for ages 8-Adult. If you like cats, animal books, fantasies, and battles, you will like this book.It is a tale of loyalty, friendship,and survival, all told from a cat's point of view.In this book, Rusty, a housecat meets some wildcats while wandering in the forest behind his humans' house.He decides to leave his life as a housecat and join them.Rusty soon learns of the four warrior clans who live in the forest, each with its own speialty: Thunderclan, the bravest of the clans, Riverclan, Knowing the ways of water, Windclan, the swiftest of clans, and Shadowclan, the strongest of the clans, and they all must fight for the prey the foest contains.And so Rusty enters the world of the clan cats, and he has more to worry about than the strange belifs these cats share, for Rusty soon realizes he has left his esey life and steped into the brutal outside world: the world of the clan cats."
4,The first cat book,"The author, Erin Hunter, has created a nice cat adventure and action series by creating out a forest-river- world in which cats have their own system of governance and with specific tasks in the society. The cats here act like cats and they do what cats do. These cats live in clans and each clan has a dedicated area in their small world in which each cat is restricted to live. There are wars and fights, of course, because the leaders of the clans die and there are power mongers who want better living areas than what they currently have.Hunter has created a leader and a medicine cat for each clan, who heals and rubs natural herbs into wounds.You can clearly see that the author loves cats and has studied them and how they act.This first book Into the Wild tells how a simple house cat Rusty decides to join the Thunderclan and become a member of the clan, and a warrior."
5,Great Book,This is book is a great read. The series is wondeful for any age. I am a college student but I still enjoy it. Not a difficult reading level but quite a catchy read. I recommend starting at the beginning of the series. I am a dog person but still love these books.
5,Book 1: Into the Wild,"This book is the best 5star book have ever read.This is a great cat book. You get to see are main character. Rusty is a dream with cats fighting.In the forest the next day a cat jumps on his back.That went he meants Bluestar,Graypaw,and Lionheart.He go to the clan and earns his warrior name Fireheart.We have some sad times cat died and Fireheart meants some new friends. Warrior Cats For Ever!"
5,Warriors #1: Into the Wild,Personally I think this was a fantastic book and it deserves a 5 star rating. And let this book nourish young creative minds. I think it will go far. In a kids mind at least. I believe in Erin. ;)
4,Go Firepaw!!,"This book was an excellent read however if you're as big of a cat lover as I am, then you may have some trouble getting through the parts where cats get killed, and they describe it. I understand that the story isn't real. however, it is, because it depicts how REAL ferral cats live; Fighting for food, shelter, and territory just to survive. Also, if you've ever heard a real outdoor cat fight, it's awful, and getting the image of them fighting in the book, recalling how horrid catfights soud, can break your heart (not to mention your eardrums). but besides my soft spot as far as fighting animals and them being hurt goes, the book was indeed EXCELLENT and now I'm going to read book 2 to find out what happens! What also made it good were all the little ""twists"" and ""turns"" in the book. All kinds of things you'd never expect! :) I also want to find out how Ravenpaw is doing!"
5,Into The Wild...,"This book will capture your imagination; you will look at the old house cat in a whole new way! It is for more than just children, although they love it too! Hunter dose a splendid job in creating a fantastic world of culture and legend for our feline friends. I highly recommend this series, for all ages. You will find it captures train of thoughts and keeps you thinking of the characters and what you think may happen even when the book is closed. Splendid, no animal and fantasy lover's collection is complete with-out these! A Must Read!"
2,I wanted to like this book/series,"My son in 10 years old and I always read book reviews before I invest time and money into a book. The reviews for this series were great and I thought the story would be appealing to little boys.I always read to my son before bed, and as a parent some books I can't wait to read the next night, and some you dread. I really could not enjoy this book. Not a great story line. Too many characters with long names that sound exactly alike. I cannot keep all those cats straight. My son wasn't very excited to read it after the 4th chapter. Not a winner for us."
4,Fun read but lacks realism,"I enjoyed this book, but some of the cat's customs went further into the realm of fantasy than the concept of talking cats in the first place (like building a defensive wall). Also, I find it socially irresponsible of the author to portray neutering cats in a negative way. (It's sterilization or killing, because one way or the other the population size is going to be controlled.) I would recommend Solo's Journey (or if you want something that's actually in print, Tailchaser's Song) over this book, but when you've read that and want more, it's a fairly good way to spend some time."
2,Story goes to the dogs--er--cats,"Sorry. I couldn't finish this story. I really tried. I like cats, and I like good writing, but I just couldn't get into this one. Maybe it's the confusing names of the cats. Or maybe it's the over-the-top representation of feral cats' behavior. Or maybe I just am too old to get this concept. Whatever the problem is, I just can't recommend this book. But if it's free, try it. You can always delete it."
3,Good Series,"I love this series, but mostly because it's about cats. I would have liked it to be written better, but I do not expect it from a childrens book.The only real problem I had with this series is the typo's and the grammar errors. I feel that a published book should have NO typo's or grammar errors! They are distracting and unprofessional.Besides that, I found the series quite enjoyable."
5,Great Series Perfect for Anyone,"To all those reading the reviews and hearing the constant ""it's too childish"" or ""the books are poorly written"", I find those to be wrong. I started this series as a senior in highschool and have enjoyed them the whole time. I never had gotten hooked on a series before this one. It's possible that, if you read a lot of longer books, you would find it a little boring, but I thought it was great for any age of reader."
5,Amazing Book!,"Warriors #1: Into the Wild (Warriors)This was a very fun book to read. It is about Rusty, a cat that wishes to catch a mouse. He leaves his home and joins a clan to save all the Warriors in it. He must please everyone in the clan. He must hunt for the clan and train to be a Warrior. His best friends in the clan are Graypaw and Rayvenpaw. The clan leader's name is Bluestar; they must always protect her. I loved reading this book and if you like cats you will love this book! I can't wait to get the second one!Fire and Ice (Warriors, Book 2)"
5,warrior cats,WOW thats all I can say... I think Im gonna make this short. OKay here are the best things about warriors to me. you never know whats going to happen even if you think you do.warriors really lets you get to know the charicters unlike other books.and lastly .........Its amazing. you might think Im saying that because Ive run out of things to say but im not. I highly encouage every one to read these books.........I already got my friend hooked.
5,"Awesome!! 3 words, BEST BOOKS EVER!!!!","Warriors is a mindreading series for all cat lovers. If anyone asks me ""What book should I read that is mind blowing?"" I would recommend Warriors."
2,"SPEED IT UP, will ya??","I like the idea , but the book series seems like it go's on forever.out of all the series Erin Hunter has the first book of the warriors would, be the best. if your looking for a good book to read maybe read the first book ( if you really love cats, which i do :) ) but i also love these books: percy jacksonheros of Olympusthe penderwickslove Aubreyharry potterrideing freedomnancy drewi recormend those a maybe, Warriors book #1 In Too The Wild"
5,A Pre-teen Review,"This book was amazing. I found that this book was hard for my class mates to understand/absorb. This book was a real jump from the spicy romance novels and fantasy novels I tend to drift toward. At first, it was hard keeping up with all the new referances/names.But, once I caught on, it was hard to even rip my eyes from this book. I read this in one sitting. I recommend this for everyone. I think most of the challanges I had were because I am dislexic. I really liked the fact that it was flawlessly written. Plus, even a person who shows some dislike to cats would find this interesting. But, be ready to buy the whole series, I promise you, it will be hard to go without. Such a captivating series."
5,Asome,"This book is one of the BEST BOOKS I've ever read. It is fascinating and makes you look at the world a new way.This book is interesting to both kids and grown-ups. Be-warned, there's some violence and death in the book."
4,First book in one of the best series of all time,"this book is not the best in the series, but it does spark what could possibly be the best series of all time.Read it now, and begin the warriors journey!"
5,Best. Series. Ever.,"All right, down to business...Rusty, a house cat, joins a Clan of wild cats. He becomes Firepaw and is mentored by the Clan leader herself, Blue star! He learns that Tigerstar, the Clan deputy, killed the former deputy and wants to kill his apprentice (Ravenpaw) because he knows the truth. A former Shadowclan medicine cat, Yellowfang, helps poor Ravenpaw escape but is blamed for the disappearance of some kits. The clan wants to kill Yellowfang but Firepaw saves her. The tyrannical Shadowclan leader is driven off and Firepaw/ his friend Greypaw are made warriors."
5,Great Book,It is a awesome book. It has everything a book needs. It is a big tale of bravery. I love it!
5,Wow!,"This book kept me interested with all of the action. The book was very discriptive. This is for sure a book thay I would read over. In fact i just bought it two days ago and i have read it 1 1/2 time. This is a great book. Will keep Harry Potter fans at bay while they wait fir the new book.It is very similer to Harry Potter just without the magic and with cats. I actually have some charecter comparisons. Firepaw is alot like Harry, they want to prove themselves and are adventurous. Grawpaw is just like Ron, they like to joke around and are almost always thinking about thier stomachs. Ravenpaw is just like Hermione they are cautious and are clever and quick. Tigerclaw is like Snape, they are cruel and dark. Bluestar is like Dumbledore they are both witty and fair. Lionheart is like McGonagell. Everybodyshould read this book. Cat lovers will love this book but just awarning there are cats that die!"
5,Warriors!,"Five Stars! Amazing book! I loved this book I am going to keep reading the Warriors, they are awesome! Amazing"
5,Amazing.,A fantastic book for those who love adventure and action. I would recommend that those who have read this read the entire series.
5,I Love Warriors,I love this book a little more than the other Warriors books.In this Firepaw has to go through the trials of being a Clan cat.
5,*Warriors- The absolute best books ever!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!*,"*This book is about a house cat named Rusty. He has always dreamed of becoming something grand and heroic. His adventure begins! Rusty takes off into the wild, (hence the name), leaving his warm house life behind. Rusty meets more wild cats living in clans and joins Thunderclan. The local everyday orange housecat becomes Fireheart, a strong loyal wild cat! Fireheart's story is one of courage, friendship, loyalty and beliefs. Don't miss the next few books in this magnificent series.I love this book (and all the others) so much, it really makes me think differently about my two cats! This novel makes you wonder about how the cats' mind really does work...By: Ariah Colt, B.C. Canadap.s:I LOVE WARRIORS (and my dog Finni!) *"
5,Love at First Read,"Wonderful book, I was at a book store looking for another book saw it, bought it, and read it. To sum it up I was there for Number Two the next day.Although the story is black and white, the characters are very likable. Cats would not live in tribes, but hey it is fantasy. Firepaw gets away with alot of stuff but when caught is punished like anyother cat would be. The only really stupid thing is having Firepaw should not be apprentinced to Bluestar. To much destiny stuff. Quiet oblivisly he will become a great leader-hero to the other cats, not to mention getting the girl. Atop of all that this is a loveable book and a must read for anyone serious about fantasy.=)"
5,Got him reading!!!,"My fifth grade son has always had a strong aversion to reading...then he picked up this book! He went thru the first two in record speed and we had to go, at 8:30pm, to pick up the next... only to find the shelves empty!!Its a WONDERFUL thing to write such an exciting and captivating story that a non-reader simply can't get enough!I HIGHLY recommend this book to any parent looking for a book to captivate their 5th -7th grader!"
5,Cat story,"Everybody should buy this adventurous book Into the Wild. This book is about cats fighting for survival. These cats follow a law of a clan named Starclan. Starclan is practically heaven but with no God only cats. A cat named Rusty lives with people, or Twolegs, and that makes him a kittypet. Rusty goes into the woods and joins a clan named Thunderclan. He is supposed to promise to protect his clan with his life. He makes new friends and finds out treacherous secrets that only he can reveal. He gets a new name from his clan and before he came the clans medicine cat had a vision that only fire can save the clan. Rusty is worried but will be ready when war comes to his clan."
5,warriors,I really love this book. It reminds of a book i once read. It has alot of action. Its also interesting how clan cats live without depending on humans. I suggest getting this book.
5,loved it!!!!!!!,"This book is the begining of a interesting, actionpacked, and fun series! I could not put it down!!!! the plot is intreging and it is like notting I've ever read befor!!"
5,too great,I have read lots of Warrior books but this book was just well like I said TOO GREAT!Or maybe even well I just cant explain! I wish I could be a ThunderClan cat! I wish could be Spotted leaf she rocks! And if your reading this Erin Hunter I cherish you.Please keep rocking out on those Warrior awesome Warrior books!
4,WOOOOOOOOOOOOOOW,I picked this book up on the way to a 18 hour flight. once I got on the plane I said oh well here goes. ( The book really does not tell you what its about on the cover) Needless to say I was upset my flight was over. Good thing I was flying to meet my husband!!!!!!!!!!!
2,not that great,I think Cirque Du Freak Vampire Mountain is ok. There's not that much action at all but the author gives good descriptive words. I think this book is just preparing for the next book. This is the 4th book in the series and it leaves you waiting for the next one.
2,Doesn't live up to expectations,"This book is the worst book in the Saga so far. There is none of the action and confrontations that were in the first 3 books and in the next 3. Darren journeys to Vampire Mountain with Mr. Crepsley, some wolves, Little People, and an old friend. The only good part of this book was the fight with the bear (I will say no more). If you're into this series, you must read this book to keep up, but if not STAY AWAY!!!"
5,great book,"this book is great for ages 10+. keeps your mind on the book and doesn't get boring. by the end, the reader is left astound. it is about a young half vampires journey to the vampire kingdom, vampire mountain, where he is welcomed warmly by other and gets to see many of his kind.There is one problem though; he was blooded (when blood travels from the vampire to the soon to be vampire) too early. Therefore, to prove himself worthy of being part of the vampire clan, he must engage the trials of initiation."
2,When does this series pick up?!,"I have read all of the books in the series up to this point. Their short and pleasant, so I might keep up with them even if they are written a bit sloppily. I'm just a bit weiry of them at this point. Just about nothing ever actually happen everything is spoken of. Basically,the book plays out like this:Darren: Mr. Crepsley, Why is the sky blue?Mr. Crepsley: Well, Daren...Daren: Mr. Crepsley, how come blood is thicker than water?Mr. Crepsley: Well, Daren...Come on! How can a book be propelled by a kid asking a bunch of questions?! You really can tell that this writer is new. He's clueless sometimes. It's like a history lesson! I'm in no hurry to read the other books in this series."
4,love this series,"I started this series when I was in middle school, can't wait to finish it! Always an entertaining and easy read."
4,Darren Shan's Vampire Mountain,"Vampire Mountain is book #4 in Darren Shan's thrilling, suspenseful and horrifying saga about a half vampire by the name of Darren. In this book, Darren and his master, Mr. Crepsley, make a dangerous trek to the Vampire Mountain. Along the way he encounters new friends, thrilling secrets, and a blood thirsty bear looking to rip him to pieces. Darren Shan is an excellent author, keeping you glued to your seat by throwing in creepy macabre touches. I recommend this book (along with numbers 1 through 3), to anybody looking for an irrisistable read."
3,Not the best,"Most of the time I was sleeping of bordem. Waiting for action, but the only ation I got was me drooling on my pillow.Sometimes there was ation but lasted for about a minute, thenanother 100 pages for a little more action.Wasn't pleased."
3,looks cool...,"this product looks amazing, but if you look closely you'll see that it's cracked and actually looks like it's been pieced back together...whats going on here?"
5,Love 'Crimes of Passion!',"Quite simply, I'm glad that Big Head Todd and the Monsters are still doin' it! I've had 'Crimes of Passion' since first released, and it remains a constant play selection for me. Any BHTM fan that doesn't quite 'get' this CD needs to keep listening (while giving thanks that Todd and the gang have found a way to keep their fans in grace). 'Imaginary Ships' is one of their best ever. ....LOVE this CD and can't wait for the next one!"
4,Depends what you're looking for,"I guess I can't say I'm a die hard fan because I don't love everything he does but I usually wind up getting it. I bought the cd at full price in a store which I never do anymore. Long story short, it's a very nice album that I think I will play on mellow and rainy days. I seem to love it on rainy driving days right now. It's not midnight raido or sister sweetly which are my favs. I go for the faster stuff and the long jams. But this has charm and for fans of blues and people that dig the slow stuff on stratagem then I'd reccomend it. It's towards the mellower vibey side but it's solid. Conquistidors rubs me the wrong way but I actually dig dirty juice which some other people on here have dismissed."
3,"Where's the passion in ""Crimes of Passion""?","...I own all the BHTM albums, I attend concerts in Denver and Austin, and I will purchase every future BHTM release, but it seems like they have been sleep walking through their last two albums. Where's the passion they displayed on Midnight Radio? I really thought they would have found their niche as a band after their 7th studio release. I had a vision of them evolving into a heavy blues band. They should replace the whispy vocals that comprise 3/4 of every song and just ROCK and have FUN. Sorry BHTM, but Los Lonely Boys are the best 3-piece band going these days."
4,listen to it twice,"For those of you who are lifelong BHT fans, the songs on this CD should make you finally aware just how much of a lyricist and composer Todd Park Mohr is. Listen to these songs twice before you judge and the second time follow the lyrics. You'll be impressed how soulful and expressive he can be. Anyone who cannot be transported to another place with ""Imaginary Ships"" and especially ""ICU in Everything"" is missing so much. Relationships are the events of life which cause us all pain and pleasure at some point and these songs speak to me of both."
3,It will grow on you,"I really didn't care for this album at first. It sat on my shelf for about two years until I thought I would give it another try. There are about 4 or 5 really great songs on here. Angela Dangerlove, ICU in everything, Beauty Queen, Love transmission, are my favorites. The rest of the album is pretty good."
2,Where's their old grit?,"I want a BHTM album that will grab me by the hair, throw my face into the bumper of a parked '76 Ford pick up, and fracture a mouthful of teeth. This album isn't it..."
4,"A very , very good movie","In this very good non fictional movie , the famous writer William Gibson talks all about cyberpunk,a literary genre that is something like dark science fiction .In this movie Gibson also explains thinks like ""cyberspace"" and ""virtual reality"" . The movie is well done and good for all people who want to know more about tecnology and how will be the live and the internet in the future ."
3,depends on what you're looking for,"beginners intro, nothing really stands out except for william gibson talking, and then it is the three or four quotes from neuromancer that make this video stand out. the best part is the uber leet box with gibson on the back in the stupidest glasses."
5,very good game for someone that loves the series,story keeps you on the edgeyou feel your actually fighting due to actual combatand if you like mysteries this game might interest you too
3,Romantics and Realists,"This set is produced under the name of KULTUR. Well, its sort of pseudo Kultur. The narrative does not follow the illustrations, and the experts comments are really too brief to make a point. They seemed more concerned in getting something on the market than producing something educational.Still, it is a good outline or introduction for a beginner. The quality of the pictures is pretty good. After viewing this, where does it get you? You won't be able to talk about these subjects at a party nor pass any test, But you will have a wide base on which to continue your studies.If you are taking your trip, these will not help as they do not disclose where the paintings are on display. If you are a student, there are some tidbits that might add interest to your essay exam.Then again, you can put in these CDs, let them run and leave the room. Amazon carries many of these boxed sets, and I have purchased several of them, knowing what they are. I use them as beginning steps of my study."
5,Jakks delux talking pokedex,"My daughter really loved this game... she was really into pokemon at the time and used it alot...It really holds up...It still looks about as new as when we purchased it... If your child loves pokemon, this is a great game."
5,My son loves it!!!,"I don't know much about this toy, but my son has enjoyed it very much. He has speech impairement and that was the reason I choose this toy."
4,Pokedex,"When i ordered this was not sure of even what it was, but it went over great, and my nephew was estatic. He enjoyed playing with it and seeing his favorite pokeman characters."
5,Fun for any Pokemon lover,My nephew gave this toy to my son when he out grew it. MY 6 year old is now very much in to Pokemon and he loves this thing. I would have to say it is very durable and works great since it is a hand me down and has already been through one other loving it. I found this one on Amazon because my other nephew wanted one too. It doesn't seem they make these anymore so I came to Amazon to look and I think the price was really good. I don't know the original price was when it was bought by my nephew but this seemed very reasonable. If you have someone in your family who loves pokemon and finding out info on all the different ones this is the toy!
4,Sturdy and entertaining,My 8 year old loves this game. He has gotten hours of use and fun out of it so far. I'd recommend it for child between 7 - 10.
4,Voluptuous Prose,"Yes, the characters indulge in all sorts of sins, from casual sex to snorting cocaine (the line of beauty) to financial shenanigans, but that doesn't mean the characters are uninteresting and the plot not engrossing. This was a book I couldn't put down. The author's prose are intentionally Henry James-like (the hero is obsessed with James) and each sentence is crafted to emulate the Master. I would recommend the book to anyone, especially if they have an interest in England in the Maggie Thatcher days, a period he brings to life with astonishing accuracy."
1,"Frightfully BORing, ol' chap","When I read that Hollinghurst had a new book out, and a prize-winner at that, I was really looking forward to reading it. I requested it from my public library and had to wait a couple of months for it to become available. After part 1, pg. 160 (Nick's first ""love"" affair), the book was due back, and I gladly returned it. Read the other 1-star reviews, and I TOTALLY agree with those in-depth reviews.I found it impossible to ""relate"" to and/or care about ANY of the characters in this book--two important criteria for a ""good"" book-- in my opinion."
1,Utter rubbish,I agree with a previous critic that this is one of the worst books ever to win the Booker. I hated it so much - its obsession with people of no consequence and the belief that it was 'recording' something important. It is crass and banal. Awful. Don't get me started on its attempt to be shocking!
1,"Tremendous, unmitigated downer","One of the worst books I have ever read. A perversion of an unquestionably great talent (and I don't mean the sex). The worst thing in art is using talent to send out a message that is without hope.There is a lot of very explicit sex in this book. No problem with that. The problem is that none of these mostly very unlikeable people learns anything, grows as a person, shows any degree of integrity or finer human qualities. They show the worst side of humanity, something worth looking at, but without a spark of hope for something better, it is just a collosal bummer.True art uplifts, inspires, enlightens. It makes us face up to the worst of ourselves and ultimately makes us glad to be human."
1,Nig-Nog?,"One wishing to learn about racism in the gay community would do well by reading the collected novels of Mr. Hollinghurst. The graphically brutal rape of the white protagonist by the black cook near the end of The Swimming Pool Library is disturbing; but no less so than Hollinghurst's gratituous use of racial slurs and the stereotypical depiction of the ""black"" council clerk, Leo, in this contemporary ""masterpiece"".Not my cup of tea."
5,The power of observation,"Alan Hollinghurst has been a fine novelist for many years, starting with ""The Swimming Pool Library,"" but in ""The Line of Beauty"" his powers of observation and insight are at their height whether writing about the mundane or the consequential.Is in not a matter of what this book is ""about,"" it is a work of art and an experience that you don't want to end."
2,If you like plot-driven novels.....,"Then this book isn't for you. I gave it an extra star because it really is well-written but, my God, how boring! I'll never understand why books like this win prizes. I finished the book with a hope and a prayer that something would happen. Please someone get killed or pregnant or arrested or something! The only time things actually moved along were the last 30 pages. It seemed liked it was about the family throwing jabs at each other and everyone else. The family on vacation; the father running for office; the daughter and her manic-depression. I was constantly wondering ""what did they mean by that?"". Since the book is set in London and the author is a Brit. there were references and some slang that I simply could not understand being an American. I might even try to rent the movie -- maybe that was more interesting?I don't see myself going out and trying to find another Hollinghurst novel."
1,nothing beautiful about it,"I had such high hopes for this book - nominated for all those prizes! If you're looking for gay fiction then this book is for you. It should be sold with the porn magazines - the first 100 pages ramble on and on about gay sex - but never get to a storyline. I tried to endure. I kept hoping there was a story! I grew up in Britain and thought this sounded like a great perspective on the Iron Lady (Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher) and 80's Britain. But it's just about a guy trying to fit in with a bunch of snobbish upper class twits! Oh yes, and there's lots of gay sex."
3,"First-rate, but not his best","I've grown accustomed to waiting for years for the new Hollinghurst novel. It's easy to see why -- his novels are beautifully crafted and polished. He includes countless highly perceptive observations along the way. The Line of Beauty is no exception, but it is not a satisfying read. Perhaps because the characters are all so unlikeable and selfish.If you like Hollinghurst, by all means, you must read this latest. If you don't know him, read The Swimming-Pool Library and A Folding Star (my personal favorite) first. These novels, in addition to being true literature, also manage the remarkable feat of being incredibly sensuous and even erotic."
2,Uninteresting people doing uninteresting things while saying really really uninteresting things,I thought I would really enjoy this book as it takes places in a neighborhood of London in which I lived many years ago. But the characters are perhaps the most uninteresting I have ever encountered in a novel and their precious dialogue is beyond boring. The only reason I give it 2 stars is because there is a lot of good writing in this book - but to no purpose. Highly unrecommended.
2,Well....,"The writing is very good, but the true and simple test of a novel is to ask oneself these questions: Do I care about the characters? Can I stop reading this book right now and never wonder about how it ends? If you answer no to the first question and yes to the second, it is not a good work of literature. The Line of Beauty is, unfortunately, one of these novels. Tedious, overly mannered and stifling."
5,"Best Novel of the Millenium, So Far",There's no way to know how long LoB will hold the title but no novel written since 2001 is any better than this one. Hold Hollinhurst up against any of our so-called genius American novelists writing today and see the truly impoverished state of letters in the U.S.
2,Excruciatingly boring and self absorbed,"I looked forward to this book with anticipation. But I soon found myself bored beyond belief. I defy anyone to give a damn about the characters and the plot (if there is one) is interminably slow to develop. I gave this 80 pages before I gave up in disgust and threw the book into the recycle bin...Unless you have nothing but time to kill, do yourself a favor and pass this book by."
3,Well Written Bland Porridge,Want something that is digests well but requires no Prilosec? This is porridge that is predictably bland but is good for digestion by the mind. Now if he could only use his considerable talents to writing a tale with meaning.
5,What a Beauty indeed.,"In my estimation this will go down as one of the best pieces written in the English language this or any other century. I found the charaters believable and highly entertaining. I would imagine that many, many people, particularly gay men, would find Nick to be alot like themselves. I wanted to keep going back to the book, night after night as I was entranced with the story and the characters. Well written and thought provoking, what a beauty indeed."
4,Brilliant but passionless,"Anyone who read The Swimming Pool Library knows that Alan Hollinghurst can spin a tale. That book with its rich evocation of gay privileged Londoners in a time before Aids was a stunning original. And The Line of Beauty mines some of the same territory. The protagonists are the leisured, cultured classes profiting from Thatcher's liberated economy.He's a brilliant writer. But in this book at least a cold and distant one too. These are not people you can like. Or even want to spend much time with.I wish I could have liked this book more. Holinghurst is certainly a talented author who knows how to keep the story licking along. But his creations lack warmth or likeability. This is probably his intention so you could call it a success. You're not meant to like them. They are set up to be masters of their own misfortune. But its also a relief to leave them behind at the end."
4,Beautiful language-apt title,"I didn't like Alan Holinghurst's previous books very much, even though they're classics, but I loved this one. It's got a very fascinating and glamorous setting (high society London, world of politics and movies), and the main character is very appealing even though he's flawed. If you like novels that are smart AND move along quickly with plot AND have beautiful sentences, you cannot do wrong with this one. Well deserved the Booker Prize."
3,"Excellent craftmanship, impoverished content","LINE OF BEAUTY is a fine piece of writing; I wish I could accomplish something nearly as good. It was also a difficult read for me because Hollinghurst provides so little relief from the hollowness of main character's life -- from everyone's lives, really. I know he intends to represent the era, and I have a high tolerance for bleak (meaning that I often adore it); but nothing works without the benefit of contrast, and this is a one-note symphony. I'm glad I read it, but I didn't learn anything, and it left me feeling uniquely depressed. Perhaps that was the writer's intent."
2,An interminable bore,There is little redeeming in this unbearably boring and overly drawn out book. The mystery is how it was preferred by the judges over the astonishing Cloud Atlas or even the blackly hilarious I'll Sleep Till Noon for the Booker. Dull and sleep inducing...
2,Oh Gee...,"I was disappointed by this book. By the end of the book I still had not developed any real feeling for any of the characters. It's an awful lot of slogging through boring upperclass British nattering, punctuated by somewhat startling little bursts of graphic sex. It was an odd juxtaposition. However, if you're keen on fairly hot gay sex scenes, this book's for you! Nick Guest, the main character, is not terribly interesting and I was sorry to have spent so much time in his company. I'm just glad I read quickly because I'd be mad if I invested any more than a few days' worth of subway rides on this."
2,despite the praises,"I couldn't finish this book. This book is not for me. I plodded through descriptions after descriptions of flowers, mansions, people's dresses, and parks in which anonymous sex takes place. I don't feel any story that ties the book together. I skipped to the ending and saw the ravages of AIDS on Nick, the main character, and people around him."
1,"Boring, boring, boring","I found reading the book very tedious. He takes chapters to say very little. I had to read the book for a book club, or I wouldn't have finished it."
2,Such promise; such disappointment,"Perhaps I will be accused of owning tickets to ""Short Attention-Span Theatre,"" but my best efforts to plow through this lush but frank effort were all for naught. Hollinghurst, as advertised, possesses a wondrous facility for words; even the most mundane acts are described with a fluent accuracy that the reader is inclined, often, to exclaim, ""yes, that's it. He said it perfectly!"" Nevertheless, lovely writing does not a compelling novel make, and that, combined with a penchant for a relentless gay-dominated, ""where's my next man?"" theme, simply left me at the station. Others may choose to take this ride, especially if first chapter anal male sex is your metier, but even this tolerant reader was looking for more than the constant longing found in Nick's loins. Fine writing can be found elsewhere in countless more compelling efforts."
5,"Toffs, Poofs & Allegators",For all you time poor 21st C ites. This is book is brilliant so go read it.
2,"So far the word is ""tedious""","I must admit I've never reviewed a book mid-way before. I just had to pause and relate my experience with this for a moment. I'm finding it quite tedious. Perhaps it's simply over my head, as a wholly American girl, but a lot of the themes and references are British through and through. The same sense of dry humor and caustic wit that is typical of English theater is clearly evident here. There is no doubt that it is well written, but I simply haven't yet fallen in love with the characters. Nor have I any idea what the plot actually IS yet. In the first few chapters, we are treated with an explicit gay sex scene. If this is not your cup of tea, then definitely don't buy this book. Oddly, I found this part to be interesting... maybe it's because it's a world with which I am decidedly unfamiliar. I plan to wade through the rest of it, and I hope that it picks up. I'll update my review at that time."
3,Queer life in the times of Iron Lady,"To be different, to stand out of the crowd, these are the longings that sometimesfrighten us and sometimes gives us courage. But to be declared homosexual who lives in MP's house of Tory party member, can be more than that. IT can be sad, cheerfull, dangerous, wondrous, but however you turn it, it'll always be, not so simple, deviation.And this is the book. With much influence of Kundera and Huxley, with beautiful insights in kusic, paintings and philosophy of art. Marvelous melodies of many voices flow trough all five hundred pages of the book.But, there are moments in which author overdid himself, moments that are quite pretentious, often tedious dialogues and dull dramatization. And becouse of those, this work of art with a wondrous premise somhow fails to capture one's hearth..."
1,????????,"i liken this book to fitzgerald's ""tender is the night."" and that is not a good thing. people of no substance plod through hundreds of dull dull pages. are people really this shallow? this empty? probably. but, my god, do i have to read about them? no. i do not. i simply could not finish this book (and that is rare). i wasted valuble reading time for about 300 pages, then had to admit it just wasn't working. because of all the critical acclaim this book recieved, i was very much looking forward to reading it. what a major disappointment! i am truly puzzled by the positive response this thing gets from so many people. great writing? really? i just did not see much of that here. shouldn't a book have at least one interesting character in it? it seems that dullness is making a comback in critical circles these days. too bad."
2,Not worth it,"After finally finishing this book, I am very surprised that it won a prize. The first several hundred pages have the main character (Nick Guest) doing little more than having sex, fantasizing about having sex with every other male character (major or minor), or wondering if anyone else can guess that he's fantasizing about sex.Perhaps it would be a better read for someone British, because I found it hard to appreciate the depiction of life in the British aristocracy. The character development felt very heavy-handed and repetitive, as one scene after another depicted Nick feeling embarrassed or trying to figure out how to handle a social situation.The end of the book was much more rewarding, as the web of characters unravelled and their pretensions were stripped away. I also enjoyed some clever Henry James references. Still, I don't think the investment it takes to slog through the beginning is worth it overall."
2,END OF THIS LINE,"In 1988, British gay novelist Alan Hollinghurst made a striking debut with ""The Swimming Pool Library."" Set in the Darwinian landscape of pre-AIDS homo London, the writing was beautiful and urgent, flaring at times to real poetry, while the characters exerted the pull of infatuation. I reached the end of that book resenting the forced separation and wanting to hang out with the whole lot for a lot longer.Since then, each subsequent Hollinghurst novel has been more disappointing than the last. In the latest, ""The Line of Beauty,"" his literary go-cart has come nearly to a halt. The writing is still elegant, studded with memorable turns, but the story is utterly without consequence, ditto the characters. Is Hollinghurst writing or doing his nails? Verdict: don't bother."
2,Major Disappointment,"I enjoyed and was deeply impressed by his other books, especially the first two. He's not afraid of depth of character or complexity or humor. So what went wrong here? It's well written, line my line, but I didn't care a hoot about any of the characters. Good writers know that even if you're creating a shallow character and and even a shallow era he or she should be interesting, have edges, etc. The set-piece: the party near the end is great. The last section felt manipulative. Well, he's still a good writer and I'll surely give his next book a read. As to he Booker's. I haven't read Cloud Atlas, but thought Toibin's ""The Master"" transcendent. But then, I don't get to vote"
1,the literary equivalent of watching grass grow,"This book wins my award for the most unreadable novel ever written: English twits talking endless twaddle. Thats all there is. No plot, no suspense, no conflict, no characterization, no development of anything--you could shuffle the chapters and it would make no difference in either the novel's outcome or rampant boredom. It is simply a litany of shallow upper class stereotypes making prissy comments about the insignificant concerns in their lives--i.e. a character's ""confusingly firm buttocks ... set off by his tight Fred Perry shorts."" That's about the depth of character insight one gets in this novel. Read it at your peril."
2,Incredibly overrated,"Fawning over wealth, power, their symbols and the beautiful people does not make a satire. If I wanted to know about the contents of a wealthy family's house I would prefer to look at Architectural Digest or some other glossy of the rich.[...] The difference is significant. His characters are men who have sex with men and they seem amazed by the behavior of straight folks. But they wholeheartedly support the status quo. They know how to be excruciatingly polite and cultured but they never let real feeling get in the way of grand pretensions.Hollinghust's ""satire"" of the ruling class recalls a story of a minister who abhorred pornography so much that he had to see every variety so he could protest them all. Right."
4,it is what it is,"It was exactly what I ordered, no surprises. Black paper pocket folders with fasteners. It's what I needed and it's what I got!"
4,"Not the best quality, but it will do","The seller of this product did great describing it and shipping it in a timely manner; however, the quality of the folders just aren't the best. The business card holder on the inside is perforated in one corner only, so that means I will have to tear each one myself (on over 500 folders) in order to get the cards to stay in. That's probably the worst part about them. They are not glossy on the outside, they have a dingy cheap look to them, but it will do for what I'm using them for."
5,As described. Good price,These met the requirements of what I needed and a good price. They are a bit thinner than regular ones but I just needed a lot of them to hand out papers/ course material at school.Great for report covers too.
3,not the best item but not too bad,"the ds case is sturdy and the game cases come in handy. the stuff is okay if you travel a lot with your ds. the screen protectors are poor quality and unglue easily. if you can afford something better, do not buy this."
3,Interesting Book,"In this Henry Huggin's book, Henry is trying to get a bike. So, he tries to save his money up to buy one. Also, Ribsy gets into lots of trouble. Some of the parts are very funny. I would reccommend the book to anyone 8 and up."
5,The Best Book I Have Ever Read!,"On a scale of one to ten Henry and Beezus by Beverly Cleary is a twenty. That is why I am going to try to persuade you to read this wonderful book. The first reason you should read this book is because once you pick it up you just cannot put it down. It has so many funny things that happen to Henry, Beezus, and Ramona that you cannot wait to read what happens next. Now I am going to tell you a little about this book. It is about a boy, Henry, who wants a new bicycle. His parents cannot afford to buy him one so he decides to find a way to get the money himself. If you want to know how he gets the money you will have to read the book. But don't think that reading a book about a boy that gets money to get a bike is boring. In this book Beverly Cleary makes it so much more interesting. So if you want a book that you can read that will bring the kid side out of you again, read Henry and Beezus by Beverly Cleary."
4,Its a good book,its a great book for children and it is very good if you like to know what a sister rivalry is.
5,Grandson enjoys!!!,"I LOVED these books as a young girl! Now I can pass them on to my grandkids! Boys or girls, all love them!"
3,Not one of Ann's best,"I have read 6 on Ann's books and this one is her first novel. She is best when sticking to her real life experiences and feelings. Her biographer makes a big deal about Ann's real meaning in this book and all of the subtext, but I think Ann was just stretching her literary wings. Good, but not up to Ann's standards even by her own and Charles opinion."
2,No effort...,"Now, I really liked Suspiria, but it shows that they put little effort into Conflict.. mainly because there are only 5 or 6 new songs on it, which are all just average. Maybe I'm just imaginning it, but thier Bonus Multimedia Track is oddly missing. Do they count her saying thank you to the crowd as Multimedia? Eh, you cant expect much from a bunch of goth kids who look like they recently got out of high school..."
2,Dissapointed,"If you have zero knowledge in flash then this book is o.k fo you.I learned most with free online tutorials;I was expecting more on this item. And they mentioned "":Paperback: 250 pages ; Dimensions (in inches): 2.78 x 9.62 x 7.36Publisher: Prentice Hall PTR; ISBN: 0130944106; 1st edition (October 15, 2001)"". But I haven't receive any of this book,received only 58 pages course work book that only to use for writing notes for each lecture. I am returning this item. I decided not to buy any books in online and any kind of cd trainig courses."
5,The best laugh you will have with your clothes on!,Craig is absolutely hillarious. This is a must item for all to have especially at your next get together with friends. Guarranteed to put a smile on everyone's faces.
3,Unduly vague,"Lots of info presented here but the authors have made it too esoteric and vague. You should not have to reach and re-read to comprehend the Tao.You are sitting in the forest against a large, old tree. A graceful yet timid deer approaches you cautiously. If you ignore it, the deer draws nearer. If you acknowledge it's presence, it moves away from you. The deer is the Tao.I recommend ""The Tao of Pooh"" by B. Hoff."
1,Confusing even if you are not an idiot,"This book is poorly organized and confusing. The authors used way too many quotations from other sources, i.e. books, websites. In the end, I have to wonder what the authors' own take is on the subject. It doesn't have a backbone of its own, period."
3,vague,"I just felt that after reading this book, I still knew next to nothing about taoism. the search continues..."
3,Chains are Good,What can you say. Just a bunch of chains and women. dont expect any story here. just sit back and watch.
1,Do not buy REMANUFACTURED from this outlet!,"I received a broken waffle maker. Sent it back, received another broken waffle maker. Both were broken due to poor packing. They both were broke in a place that could not be fixed to be operational.Save the headache and buy the newer Waring Pro PROFESSIONAL waffle maker with the fold down handle. If you shop around you can find one for about ten buck more than the remanufactured cleaper line for a much better waffle maker, and brand new! Would NOT recommend rebuilt on this item. Would give ZERO stars not one! Also bad customer service."
4,Promoting independence in young children,"Squeak, an adorable little elephant, wants to go outside, but everyone is busy. When he decides to go alone, Squeak takes along everything he might need while he is outside. Benson has created a wonderfully warm setting for this elephant family. The full page spreads show a surprisingly realistic family and neighborhood setting. A great read aloud for its predictability. Young children will relate to Squeak and his independence, and will be comforted by the love and affection shown by his family."
3,A bit disappointed,"I've read several of Dr. Sowell's books now and this one has me feeling a bit disappointed. I realize it's not one of his economic based books but it's simply just boring. I did enjoy his opinion of Adam Smith's books and how they relate to his thesis but other than that, it was extremely repetitive. I hope this isn't your first experience with Thomas Sowell's book because it could make it your last. Please read his economic books and you will enjoy him a lot more."
2,Hasn't been edited!,"Can't believe this book was sold. There were so many issues that could have been solved with good editing, that I quit reading halfway through the book - words left out, wrong names used, misspellings, etc., etc., etc."
3,It's okay,It does not seem to do much for stabilizing as I thought it would but it gets the job done.
5,"High quality, helpful for leveling and front wheel stability","Lightweight but high quality, stable unit. I bought this go go with my CycleOps wind trainer. Glad I did because otherwise I'd be riding downhill the whole way. Yes, this is a ""leveler"" and you would need to stack another to go ""uphill."" Keep in mind that if you raise the entire bike up, it may be harder to get onto the bike if the top beam of your frame is already high for you. Can't imagine what could be better. Recommended.Update: I still think think this is a great item and worth buying with the trainer, but more for stability than leveling. The trainer only raises the back wheel a little bit so the downhill sensation I was worried about isn't so much of an issue. The bigger problem is that without this item your front wheel may be wobbly."
5,Perfect Design,"I purchased this with the Kinetic bike trainer and i could not imagine riding without this. Not only does this hold your bike on par with the trainer, it also supports more of the front tire than the rest of the products sold out there. Keep in mind that the pressure that you are going to be placing on the front tire the entire off-season. You want as much surface area as possible so as to not put too much strain on the front rim and tire. This works out perfectly!"
4,Works as expected,This has a nice wide base and doesn't tilt or wobble when I am using it. I would buy another one if I ever needed to replace it.
3,Just a wheel holder,I bought this in order to keep my front tire raised but it doesn't add anything to my workout. It actually lifts my front tire higher than the back tire attached to the trainer. This makes the saddle very unconfortable because it is now on an angle and it cuts circulation to my legs. Climbing is about resistance not angling the bike on a slope.
5,Bike block,You MUST purchase this if you plan on getting a bike trainer. It is great and really makes the bike stable. I was surprised by the size of it - it looks like it would be small but is in fact fairly large. Great product!
2,nice but could have dont better,Works as advertised it has three lift stations on it to accommodate any size of bike. Though if has no foam edging for the floor (hardwood) so it likes to slide a little when peddling fast or standing while pedaling. Is also a little bulky think I could have found something a little smaller
3,"Works well, but bulky when stored.","Overall its just an overpriced piece of plastic, but it does its job well and it will probably never fail due to a sturdy construction. I generally use it on floored carpet or rugs and it stays securely in place during a stationary ride. Postride I usually pack the bike away to make floor room, but unfortunately this is not foldable or convenient to store. Could be better, should be cheaper, so I am completely satisfied but not thrilled with it."
5,CycleOps stackable climbing block,The block will level out the front wheel of your bike while on your trainer or will give you the feel of an uphill climb. Great buy as a trainer accessory.
4,Exactly what I needed!,"I bought the CycleOps Stackable Climbing Block for Indoor Bicycle Trainers to go with the Bell Motivator Mag Indoor Bicycle Trainer. I needed the block in order to keep the bike stable and level it when I set up the trainer. The CycleOps is simple to use, requires no tools, and is just the right accessory for the trainer. I don't need to do a climbing workout, but if I did, it would be necessary to buy a second CycleOps and stack it on the first one, since the CycleOps only permits one height for the bike. (This isn't clear from the product descriptions. I only learned it when I read the instructions.)"
3,Not totally necessary,"This block helps to hold the bike a bit more steady but overall, I don't think that it is needed. Apparently, you can stack two blocks to increase the grade but I haven't tried this (I don't want to buy another block).If you are tight on money, I would suggest passing on this item."
2,Not happy with design,"I recently purchased an indoor trainer, and decided to purchase this accessory. I thought that it would have a space in it so the front wheel is level with the rear wheel. However, it is designed so that whichever space the front wheel is in, it is always above the rear wheel. I was unaware that this block did not have a space in it to keep the front wheel at a level position. The trainer provides plenty of resistance, so I don't always want to feel like I'm climbing. I think someone needs to re-think this design."
5,Great product and deal,Works well with many different bike tires. You can buy more and stack them for great challenges while riding on a trainer.
4,a must,if you buy a trainor you definitely need one of these to bring the front of the bike up! this one is very sturdy and doesnt move much!
2,Sony GDM-500,"Have had the monitor for 5 years. Excellent up to a month ago....after being on for 5 minutes, blurry to the point where text is unreadable. For $2000 USD, I was hoping it would last longer....the issue I'm sure exists with the 520 model....GR, Windsor, Ontario, Canada"
3,The Big Chill,"Soft, Ambiant, Latin and Relaxing are just some of the words to use in order to describe Ministry of Sound's latest compilation of chillout grooves. With killer and often massive tracks which include anything from Bedrock's ""Beautiful Strange,"" Afterlife's remix of Afro Medusa's ""Pasilda"" Moby's ""Natural Blues"" to Groove Armada's ""Dusk You & Me"" The Chillout Session provides a wide selection of popular and interesting tracks. Although, some may wonder why songs like Wamdue Project's ""King of My Castle"" and Jakatta's ""American Dream"" (which are more club cuts than chillout songs) appear here, nevertheless, prepare yourself to sit back, relax and just chill out."
2,bad mix (avec clashes etc.),"I would class myself as a dance music critic (having over 3000 songs in my possession and being a dj myself) and I can safely say that the mixing in this cd is shocking. Not only do they not bother to get the bpms sinked (in cd2) but many of the tracks clash so violently that it makes me want to perpetrate a criminal act to the ministry of sound website. No, but seriously they picked a great set of tracks but did a bad job of combining most of them. I reckon if they had just left the cd unmixed it would have solved a lot of problems (employing a dj for one).Peter m."
4,Good stuff Cheap !!,"Just bought this inspite of the review. Worked great !! XP plug-n-play was just perfect. Nero installed with absolutely no probs.Already burnt 2 audio CDs, no glitches, no throw-away CDs, CDs sound great. Drive was a little noisy initially, but then I guess I got used to it along with other fan noises around.I definetely recommend this product. Worth a try b4 you write it off. Rated it 4 b'cos of the noise.I'll surely update my views based on further usage."
1,Don't Bother.,"I purchased this product as a 2nd cd recorder. My first is a Sony, a great product, but I thought I would compare them. DON'T BOTHER with this one! It gets one star b/c there isn't an option for negative numbers here...The product is supposed to *work* with the Nero software they package it with, which is GARBAGE. It is difficult to use and the support number is in GERMANY! I have an extensive background in computer technology and have never been so disappointed in a product. Please don't waste your money. I returned mine."
4,"A Pleasent, Engaging album...","Novembre's Materia is a wonderful mix of Dark Rock, Alternative, and Acoustic Rock. Songs like Memoria Stoica/Vetro, Croma and Nothijngrad are standouts, dawdling, encompassing songs that revolve around wonderful vocals, (mostly sung in Italian). This is a strong, steady, album that doesn't let you down as it progresses through the mature songs."
3,It's decent,"Being the huge Opeth fan I am, I purchased this album after seeing it on the rack at the local music store. The reviews here all give it four or five stars, so I figured it would be pretty good.First off, this album sounds more in the vein of Katatonia, with its melodic vocals. That's not a bad thing at all, given the fact that I am also a fan of Katatonia, but Novembre's melodies aren't as good, and their music is not as diverse.Materia is certainly listenable. It has its highlights (Jules, Comedia, and the title track to name a few), but overall, it's not groundbreaking. It's not incredibly interesting. The album doesn't beg to be an integral part of my music collection. In a word, it is derivative. This album will certainly stay in my rotation for at least a short period of time, but it has not left me with the urge to go out and buy their back catalogue."
3,It's what you've come to expect.,"Produced by Feldman yet again, Mest makes another mediocore album that sounds more like Goldfinger than anything else. The lyrics are typical for relationships, and while they don't challenge you to think at all, they are extremely catchy. It's what we've come to expect from mainstream pop-punk, you've heard this band before as New Found Glory, Blink 182, and Sum 41. If you like those bands and want more of the same, by all means, go out and buy this, you'll love it. Others will find this album simply lacking, being the all too typical minimal guitar playing, the nasally and predictable lyrics, or one of the other many flaws. With all this aside, the band does put on an excellent show.(...)"
1,excuse me posers....,"this isn't punk. punks don't write songs about 'rolling in their cadillac'. this sounds like blink 182 meets green day... wtf? i you want punk go listen to some TSOL, Dead Kennedys, the Nonsensibles, or any of the older stuff. jeez man, talk about TREEEEEEEENDDDDYYY."
1,Don't waste your cash.,"Ok let me start by saying that this cd is really [bad]. The only thing that saves it is the song Cadillac. Other than that, this cd is about as good as shoving forks into your ears. It has some semi-decent music, but the lyrics are so [bad] it isn't natural. I think their are so many bands that are better than M.E.S.T. (like Good Charlotte, A Simple Plan, and my personal favorite The Sarting Line) that you shouldn't waste your money on this garbage, unless you want to hear the song Cadillac (which for some reason is really good), but i just suggest that you download it."
5,they rock,Mest is an awesome band. I think they live up to what real punk is. Go buy their albums its way worth the money!
5,Mest- Destination Unknown,"This is one of the best Cd's I've heard in a long time!! I usually get a Cd and there's only one or two songs on the whole Cd I Like, but I like all the songs on this!! Plus I've met the band before and they're really cool and down to earth! I love this band and you will too!!"
5,Mest ....amazed once again!!,"I picked up the new cd DESTINATION UNKNOWEN,by the crazy guys in mest and i ould liek to say i was amazed. Thsalbum shows a more mature soun , yet ep sthe same energy and feeling as the firt cd ""wasteing time"". With driving songs like Opnions and catchy punk/hip hop songs like cadilac, the cd has a fresh new sound and shows mest in out to take over the punk scene, an then the world!!!awsome cd you should make sure to pick it up as soon as possible"
5,Mest is the best!,"Mest is a pop-punk quartet from Chicago's south side. This album really shows their development as musicians and lyricists, as well as reaffirms their talent for writing catchy songs. Perhaps you've heard their singles ""what's the dillio"" or ""Cadillac"" on the radio, but they go deeper than that on this album. Mest's music can appeal to all types of people; part of their greatness is their ability to write songs that any listener can relate to. The lyrics are simple but truthful. I suggest you check out Mest, they are one of my favorite bands, cool guys, and great live."
4,Not Your Average Punk Band,"Mest may just seem like another one of the power punk groups that have come about in the last couple years, but they really have their own style that they bring which helps set them apart from other bands of this nature. The catchy pop-punk 4-some has released a new album ""Destination Unknown"". This is the southside Chicago punkers 3rd album. The variations of melodic punk songs makes the albums so significant. With their first single ""Cadillac"", rawked the air ways in philly and all over the u.s. The album includes singles such as ""Cadillac"" and ""Mother's Prayer"". Out of 5 Stars, The album is a over all 4 out of 5."
5,Mest is WICKED,"Mest takes every genre and mixes it together. They have the pop punk edge, of course, over thuggish R&B;/Rap beats, and they have some raggae and ballads mixed in there as well. This is teenage angst, with the humor of the Beastie Boys, and the angst of Good Charlotte.They're really eclectic, and not too hard on the eyes either. :)"
5,MEST woohoo,"Destination Unknown was an instant hit with me I loved it! After listening to it for the first time I was wanting to roll in a cadillac down the small town streets of Iowa where I live....Ok so maybe Iowa isn't the best place to roll in a cadillac but that doesn't matter! what matters is that this CD is just the coolest thing. the instant it was in my CD player the volume was cranked up to be sure and vibrate the floor. The CD was fun but also had a lot of truth to it as in the songs Another Day, Fucted up Kid and Mothers Prayer just to name a few, but its hard to name specific songs that should be listened to because the whole CD just flat out rules and I highly recommend it!..."
4,Mest's New Album,"This album is great. I think that it is better than the last two albums. Mest is a great band with great lyrics. They write about what they know and have expeinced. When I listen to the album, it makes me really energized and ready to go."
2,Don't send em my way!,"This is for the guy who's review stated that Mest is more a 'pop-rock' band...While I agree with you that they're not a real punk band, Please don't send them to the ""pop-rock"" class...we don't want 'em any more than you ""true punks"" do..."
5,Way to go Mest!,WOW! This cd is awesome! I have all of theirs and this one is by far the best. Anyone who doesn't have it should go and pick it up today! Mest is a pop/punk band who has an awesome style of music. Their lyrics are true and hit close to home. Please buy this cd! xoxo
4,Mest: Destination Unknown,"Mest is a great band that hails from Chicago. Anybody that listens to Good Charlotte, New Found Glory, Blink 182, or Sum 41 then you will like this band. Their latest CD is a good follow up to their debut album, Wasting Time. Although I do think that Wasting Time is a better all around CD, Destination Unknown has a lot of catchy tracks. It has many good songs that can relate to anybodys daily life. The guitar parts in all the songs are also very catchy because they throw a variety of riffs and chords that mix very well. So anybody that likes emo punk should go out and buy this CD."
2,POP,Mest is way too poppy. They have meny stupid songs on their cd also. I would take this cd if you paid me to get it. Besides that no.
5,Mest is the Best,"First of I have to say, I don't personally own the Destination Unknown cd, but I have heard the songs from it and let me say that they are great. I recently saw Mest in concert and the songs from Destination Unknown were so awesome. Personally, anything from Mest is good to me, but the difference and variation of these songs is just the best. If this is your type of music, I'm sure that you'll love Destination Unknown."
5,Punk,"Mest's new album ""Destination Unknown"" is one of the best punk albums out there. They have a mix when is comes to their lyrics, they have some love songs, fun/funny songs, and those other songs that you just don't get. They have a great band that is really close with their fans, and they are always on tour, so ppl go out and see a show! You can also go to the website and join their street team!"
5,Ashleys review,"Destination Unknown~ MESTThis album is a mix of punk, pop, and emo. Its a kick[s] album that will keep u hanging on for more. Its a continuation of thier first and great album, wasting time. if ur into punk at all, this album will keep u banging ur head all night. its got great lyrics! but it and u wont regret it.keep mest going!"
4,Destination Unknown,"This album is not at all a disappointment. Mest deliver another pop-punk based album full of catchy riffs and great vocal harmonies. MTV friendly ""cadillac"" is a true delight combining some slick DJ-ing in the chorus. Highlights of this album include:OpinionsAnother DayReasonIt's OverChelseaAlso feautured on this album, is ""Drawing Board"", previously featured on the band's second album ""Wasting Time"" and sounds better ever.""Destination Unknown"" proves that Mest are able to write consistantly great catchy pop-punk songs, and won't be going away soon. These are going to be big."
4,Mest has done it again,"With their newest release,""Destination Unknown,"" Mest has truely made a name for themselves in the music business. This CD is chock full of fourteen songs of a great punk vibe, clocking in at 41:46. Its uplifting beats and tempo will have you hooked the first time you listen. Unlike many other CD's,""Destination Unknown,"" doesn't require you to skip any dull or useless songs. Each song is individually composed and filled with meaningful lyrics that everyone could relate to. This CD combines a unique twist of heart-felt lyrics and a punk rock beat that you can't get enough of. Although new to the music world with only their second release, Mest has demonstrated their potential to succeed in the future."
5,mest pure excellence!!,"hello everyone this cd ""Destination Unknown"",the latest from Mest is sheer brilliance at the least.It starts off great and ends better with every track getting better and better every tme you hear it.It is by far one of the best cds i've ever purchased i know ill never get tired of this masterpiece.So if you dont have it two simple words GET IT."
5,Mest Rocks,"Hey dudes u should all get this cd, its got like everything in it and i cant stop listening to it myself, the guitar melodies are awsome and the singing is great, so r the lyrics. well later"
1,posers,"they aren't real punk, they are just pop-punk. Good Charolatte (however you spell their name), A New Found Glory, Blink 182, and Sum 41 aren't punk either they are all posers like Mest. I hear people say that they are a ""underground punk"" band and thats bull, if they were then why are they popular."
5,The Best...,"Ok, peoples.... Mest is one of the greatest bands. I've been a fan of there since last October when I saw them in concert with Good Charlotte...with songs like ""Caddilac"" and ""Mothers Prayer"" what more could you ask for in a band. Great sound, awsome personalities!, and so far fans that would do anything for them. And they are rock'n without losing who they are, their roots. They know who they are, they know the sound they are, and wont change it for anything! The cd is one of the best Album's i got this year! The song are really catchy and you'll know all the words and backround music in about a day or two! This band... This CD kicks...Rawk ON!"
5,Simply Amazing,"Another amazing CD by Mest. Destination Unknow is by far the best cd I own. With songs like ""Reason"", ""Cadilac"", ""Without You"" and ""Yesterday"" its hard to find any band that comes even close to Mest. If you're planning on buying a CD that has great songs you'll never get tired of, pick up Destination Unknown, along with Wasting Time, and Mo Money Mo 40'z."
4,Good cd . band worth your ears :),"im shamed to live in florida cause of the user below .. god , i hate florida ..anyhow , mest has always been very good and i know these guys have talent . i know people who went to their shows live . the cd is full of energy and great lyrics . the songs are only a carbon copy when you search for millions of singers and find out they may have the same influences . god guys , use your brain ."
4,Destination Unknown...or is it known?,"Destination Unknown is the newest release of the band Mest. They have 14 tracks and every one has a little different style. Mest lyrics are explicit but thats what they choose to express their feelings towards the song. THe songs are fast pop-punk songs and very enjoyable. Few songs are slow meaningful songs. Destination Unknown is for you if you like: New Found Glory, Sugarcult, Unwritten Law, and many others. This artist is on its way to fame. And if more albums like this appear, Mest will be big. So give this album a try and you'll like it, or you may not."
4,"Don't settle for less, Listen to Mest","Ok, if you are reading this, then you may have some common sence and are contimplating buying this cd. Well I strongly suggest you buy this cd, it is a personal favorite for me. I absolutely love it, the lyrics and music is just amazing to me, and I believe you would feel the same. Every type of music genre would enjoy this band, even though its all about punk roCk!!, but anyway this cd definitly needs to be added to your collection, because how can you knot want a cd that you can always relate too, I mean isnt that music is about? SO BUY THE CD!!!"
4,Kick [behind] BAND!!!!,Mest is the Best!!!! I just got there cd and i fell in love with it the first time i listened to it. This is a cd every music fan must get. the songs r kick [behind] and so r the guys. if u don't go out and buy this cd i'm going to MEST you up!!!!
4,Hoping for more longevity with this One!,"So, we purchased our first identical InSinkErator product in 2004 and it worked great until about a year or two ago when the water started smelling and tasting like chemicals and then it stopped boiling. We like the look/aesthetic of this product more then others so we are trying it again. Hoping to get 10 years out of it and no funky chemical smell this time when water boils. Still a mystery about the odor! Otherwise, this brand model is wonderfully convenient, safe-to-use and an attractive product."
1,Junk -- will flood your kitchen,"Expensive and works for less than 3 years, at which time it will flood your kitchen. I've had two dispensers and both flooded the kitchen. How this product stays on the market is beyond me."
3,Easy Installation,I received the new unit and it easily fit the brackets of the former unit. The only problem I noticed is that the water has a chemical taste. I am not certain if it is caused by the material used or the heat makes the chlorine come out of the water.
2,Poor Quality,"This is a replacement for an older model H990 unit that was dying after 10 years of use. The upper portion of the unit is identical, but the undersink heater unit appears to be made of plastic, not metal, like the previous model (which had a copper tank enclosed in styrofoam enclosed in sheet metal). Notably, the other unit ran silent but this model--which you think would be an improvement--makes a very noticeable ""roaring"" sound when heating the water, audible over a low TV or conversation even from under the sink. Also, the water out of the tap is about 30 degrees cooler (170 vs. 200) at the ""factory preset"" thermostat setting. Product description on Amazon is confusing and contradictory: is it a 1 yr or 3 yr warranty? 120 or 115 volts? 2/3 gallon or 1/2 gallon tank? It gets the job done, but it's the little things like this that give the impression of diminishing quality from the InSinkErator brand, and at this price point you expect more."
3,Not Impressed!,"I expected this one to be as quiet as the 1/2 gallon model,but, it's quite the opposite.It makes a loud 'gurgling' sound every time it heats thecontainer.Gene"
3,My second In-sinkerator now leaks after 2 + years,"When we did a kitchen remodel in 1993, we installed a very expensive hot pot unit we purchased from a specialty kitchen supply. It lasted until about 2005, and I replaced it with this In-sink-erator H990C-2 Chrome hot water dispensor, which began leaking about a month ago. After spending time on their website I have learned that it is leaking from the top fittings where they attach to the tank. Their not really repairable. This Model H990C-2, as I recalled cost about $150.00 back then, now they run over $200.00. I'm not sure they are worth the price."
2,Not my idea of DVDA,A drum machine and a synthesizer. Poor quality. Just because the instruments whizz about the room does not excuse the lack of quality. In my opinion a waste of money. Please buy it so I don't feel I am the only one getting robbed.
1,save your money,"We listened to this once, and kept thinking, ""When will this end?"" It sounds like someone had a cheap synthesizer system, and put it together in their basement. After listening to this version, we put on a stereo recording we had of Bolero by a real orchestra. The difference was astonishing."
1,Strange sound,I love music... all kinds of music. Ravel Bolero is one of my all time favorites... but certainly not this one. It was very disjointed. I wish I had save the $$$. If anyone wants it I'll let it go for 1/2 price!I do have to say that the sonics were great though. It did show off my system soncially... but I sure hated the interpretation of this ordinarily fine piece of music. I bet Mr. Ravel turned over in his grave when he heard it.
2,"Nice try, but a little weird","Maybe I should have read the fine print a bit more closely before ordering this. Quite honestly, this had been done before, by Isao Tomita, and his still remains the definitive version for me. The sonics were OK, but the movement of the ""instruments"" was very distracting. In too many places, the notes were changed away from a minor key to a major. I came away from this not at all satisfied. The DVD featured both the DVD-A and DTS-ES versions, and an accompanying CD also featured the DTS-ES. They could have also included DTS96/24 along with the ES. All in all, I'd say save your money. This one just wasn't worth it."
1,Pathetic,"My rating for this product is no stars at all. Of maybe a dozen versions of this wonderful piece of music that I have heard in almost 60 years of music enjoyment, this piece must be the worst. I was so hungry for DVD-Audio surround sound recordings that I purchased two recordings from this company ""ears unheard"". This was the worst waste of money I have ever encountered. I would mail the disks back to the company to let them know my displeasure but it isn't even worth the postage.Yes, it is indeed a synthesizer all the way through. Feel free to purchase it but only if you totally understand that this is an experimental piece playing around with surround sound recording. DO NOT BUT IT IF YOU WANT TO HEAR A DVD RECORDING OF A REAL ORCHESTRA."
1,expensive mistake,"I was very dissappointed in this disc. Syntesized instruments don't even come close to reproducing Boleros majesty,not to mention many were out of key,and it was a poor quality attemt at reproducing the sounds of the symphony instuments!!! Don't waste your money,I'm sorry I bought it."
2,For Advanced readers only,I am a proficient MSXML coder but i can't get what I want (knowledge about .Net XML programming objects) from this book because the author habitually relies on advanced concepts from related technologies to explain things. So unless you are a pretty competent .Net programmer and already proficient in ADO.Net/ADO you will struggle to understand this book and struggle to understand the significance of what you are being told and why. I gave up and resorted to looking for articles on MSDN. Undoubtedly there is good stuff here but Mr Esposito writes as an extremely knowledgeable person for the already extremely knowledgeable person only.
1,A Decent Book Pick It Up !,This was a good book but not what I was expecting. The first few pages had me hooked but then I lost my my pace along with the author.Things that seem to make sense melt into a burning candle dripping down a frozen glacier two degrees north of the equator. Now I'm forever Three Doors Down ! Try it if you dare!!
4,"Good Materials, good fit.","Designed to fir my particualr vehicle, including grommets that are preciselt place to fit over the locating posts that my vehicle has."
1,Not worth the penny it cost,The seller provided timely shipping. However the product is junk. The sound is muffled and intermittently goes up and down when I move the input cable. I guess you if you buy cheap you get cheap. I have since ordered a name brand device to cassette converter which I hope will work better.
1,Doesn't work for me.,"I wish it worked -- but it doesn't for me. I have an old Land Rover Discovery with a working tape deck -- but I place this in with my iPhone attached and nothing. Sounds like it's wrestling around in there, in fact. Maybe other people will have more luck?Bobbywww.bobbyearle.com"
3,"IT WAS OK, BUT HAS A GREAT ENDING","I thought it was a little boring, but I must admit it has a great twist at the end that will literally shock you! The setting is in Jeruselem and in Jeruselem, murders are happening..........can you solve the mystery? I thought i could to, I guess that's what makes it a good book to read. There were many times when I thought the book had to much tallking and not enough action. But all in all it's an ok book."
5,Great Book,Like all of Agatha Christie's books this one is very good. Written to make you think. Takes you to a different time in history. Quality work. I will collect all of her books. Well worth reading. Makes you think.
2,another poor one,"Another very ordinary 'Poirot'. The Belgian sleuth is travelling in the middle east with a group which includes a horrible American matriarch.This horrible bit of goods gets the chop and because she's such a nasty piece of work she deserved it.Its very hard to get involved in the story when there is absolutely no sympathy for the victim.Anyway, Poirot sets out to solve the murder and he does but with one of the real cheat endings of Christie's career . The reader should at least have an outside chance of solving the murder but this one gives you no hope. Not great. (1938)"
4,A QUESTION OF MORALS...,"As in some of her books, Christie explores the issue of moral standards. Is it okay to kill someone if they are truly evil and oppress everyone around them? This is the case in a slightly unusual and intriguing book.Who would be so desperate to kill their mother and grandmother? The question stays at the center of the book as you realize each family member had ample motive. After all, the grandmother that was murdered controlled her relatives while slowly choking the life away...You will find yourself questioning the situation and wondering what you would do if you had to do something...as either the oppressed--or as the law.Christie takes this book beyond frivolous murder and into a perhaps even controversial set of events. It is worth reading as her efforts to produce an above-average mystery are apparent."
2,A fair-to-good Christie novel...,"""Appointment with Death"" is full of shocks as Agatha Christie's books usually are, but is nowhere near as interesting as ""Death On The Nile"" or even ""Evil Under The Sun"". For ""Appointment with Death"", I would recommend renting the video (starring Peter Ustinov as Poirot, featuring Lauren Bacall & Sir John Gielgud, Director: Michael Winner 1988) which, strangely, has more shocks than the book! Not at all bad, but not to be read before the thrills of the Nile river and the Orient Express trip."
4,very very good,i thought this book was one of christie's best books right along 'and then there were none' and 'murder on the orient express'. it was almost the end before i figured out who was the killer and i can usually figure out who did it. again i say this was a very good book and i recommend it to everyone
3,This book is missing something.,As a reader of many Poirot books this one seems some what dull. Unlike many of Christie book this case had almost no pychological aspects to it. The solution reminds me to much of Encyclopeida Brown. Also the marriage thing at the end was very pathetic. This is not the Agatha Christie I know and love.
4,A deep psychological work,"It's one of the most enthusiastic books of Agatha Christie. The facts are clean ( without any false clues ), and after reading it up to the end, you'll say (... as always in this author's great novels) ""but sure it is !"". Besides these aspects, it's a good book because the story wraps up us with interesting characters and a terrific drama. Something rare at Agatha Christie's books. Most of time she worries a lot only how to surprise the reader at the end of the story. Fortunatelly this one is a exception. Take a look!"
4,appointment with death,This is a pyschologically probing mystery that centers on a truly horrible old woman and her oppressed family. You will never see the twist ending coming. Immensely enjoyable potboiler that really has you feeling sorry for the old woman's family. The desert location only adds to the oppression
2,1 good movie & 2 fair ones,"The Sell Out is the best of these 3. Good acting by Richard Widmark. For the other two movies, Inside man would be second best and kept my interest well enough. Hangmen though is a different story. Too much gunplay & people getting killed. I only sat through it for the Sandra Bullock parts since this was her very first movie. She was good & the rest of the picture was so so.Expect the picture quality to be slightly soft (like VHS) due to the compression needed to put 3 movies on one DVD. The sound on all 3 is mono plus the movies are all full screen format."
3,If you like old flicks - one is a really good bad movie,"I am refering to Hangmen - apparently Sandra Bullock's screen debut. My jaw dropped and soon I was rolling on the carpet in spasms. So much silly dialogue and unexplained action are the very essence of a good bad movie. The directing and the photography are acually quite good and show New York at its grittiest. Sandra Bullock gets shot with a kind of a tranquilizer bullet - you know, the ones they use on enraged rhinos in wildlife parks. No, really, I can honestly recommend that one. The rest: forgettable (The Inside Man), truly annoying (The Sell Out)."
1,"Hoping, But NO","Was hoping other reviews were off, but unfortunately they were right. Not even close to a recommended movie. Or as would be said by submariners, a true ""Five finger gagger""."
2,Dreadful Man,"I agree with most of the other reviewers on this one. This is a dreadful, dreary awful movie. With Dennis Hopper in it, I was hoping for more than a B movie. The story line is a good one, a true story about a Russian submarine able to sneak into Norwegian waters. The acting is poor, the characters are predictable. The action star even drives a Trans Am (in Norway non the less). If you like submarine movies, there is about 30 seconds of submarine time in the whole movie. Even the Michael Dudikoff sub movies are better than this one. :)"
2,90 minutes gone from my life,As we used to say in the submarine service . . . you get a double punch on your Hurter Card for sitting through this. How did they get Dennis Hopper to sign on for this one? It looks like it was filmed with a camcorder. During the semi-nude scenes I found myself looking for holes in their underwear. I'll give it 2 stars since it was in color and had sound.
4,Decent B movie,"An uknown nuclear submarine conceals iteself in protected waters, Sweden's government along with the United Status must find the enemy. Just when the solution is at hand, a top secret laser designed by Sweden's military is stolen and the lab is destroyed. Now everyone is under suspicion including the Swedish government, the laser inventors, as well as the terrorists. Dennis Hopper is Miller, a United States official assigned to find the laser and get it back - before it's technology falls into the wrong hands."
2,The Inside Man,"This film, set and filmed in Sweden, had the potentials to be a good cold war thriller. After all, they have some good actors, like Dennis Hopper. Unfortunately, the story is not that great and the pace is slow. It's not an awful movie but it's also not as entertaining as it could have been. Nice to see Gösta Ekman and Dennis Hopper together, and Lena Endre, who has since become one of Sweden's most famous actresses, made her film debut in this one.The movie is something of a curiousity piece and even though I didn't think it was very good, I'm glad I have seen it, and there are cheap DVD editions, so if you're curious about it, go ahead and spend five or six dollars on it, but don't expect too much."
5,packed well - arrived in time specified,"I'd worn out my 1960s purchase of this book..........reread one of Delderfield's ""sets"" almost every winter........THanks for having it!!"
1,Very bad quality,"The description looked very good and I thought it would prov eto be good toy for my 3 year old son. But the quality of the product is very good. After very light use for a few days, many of the magnets have come loose and the plastic casing has broke. The concept of the toy is good but the quality if very poor."
4,Good however small,"This is a great toy. I was skeptical at first, however my 3 year old loves it. He plays with it for long times and enjoys the free build time with his imagination. I only gave 9 out of 10 stars because it is to small. It is good if you want to find out if your kids would like it, but I suggest buying a bigger package to really build with."
4,Good solid advice,"Excellent primer for new business and reference for those a few years in. I found it covered most topics of interest except state taxes, which in the DC/MD/VA area is still a mystery to me."
1,Not Oringals!,Beware: These are not the original hit or album versions of these songs. They are re-recorded versions of the songs.
1,Toy has a basic design flaw,"We bought this toy for our 2 year old who loves to play with her toy kitchen. This is a basic fun toy - all kids love to take things in and out of something at this age.However, this toy has a basic design flaw and we ended up tossing it out after just 3 days.The basket holds onto the base with a very flimsy amount of plastic that sort of latches on the bar across the back of the base. This plastic makes a simple hook that is relatively easy for young kids to take on/off but it doesn't have nearly enough material to last. My daughter pushed down on the basket once and the plastic cracked and the backet then hung down. Then we tossed it and were very dissapointed.Hope this helps you pick a better quality toy."
5,Fun for many ages,My grandson loves to fill this with everything he can find. It is light weight and great for the toddler age.
3,Not what expected,"The problem is not from the seller. I have this movie in VHS which is very nice. I bought this and found out that atcors were different, they did not really say a word,just writing out the words. I just bought another version."
1,Dont' waste your $$$...breaks within 6 months!,We bought this showerhead so it could help our skin and my dd's eczema. It was great while it lasted but now cracked in 2 places and is unusable. I can't believe I paid over $60 for it!
1,Expensive and poor quality - not a good combination,"Regardless of their orientation in politics, I think most people would agree that a dictionary should give objective definitions of ideas, not opinions of the author. This ""dictionary"" does not have an ounce of objectivity in it. The author frequently substitutes his opinion of an idea for the definition of it.Also, given the price, I expected a bigger book. It's not very large, though admittedly it has had most of the terms I wanted to look up in it.If I knew of a better dictionary for politics I would recommend it; since I don't, I simply recommend not wasting your money on this one."
3,A few maps would help,"The Mountain of Silence is Mt. Athos ""in Northern Greece,"" home for 2000 Greek Orthodox monks and hermits; yet much of the narrative centers in Cyprus. A map would help to orient the reader. The author introduces us to architects, physicians and idealists who have abandoned the modern world for a life of prayer and austerity on remote Mt. Athos, ""the Christian Tibet."" Indeed, I feel like I am following a tenured hippie through a Christian ashram. Is this the way to ""attain oneness with God?"" Do the prayers of Mt. Athos ameliorate tragedies of this world? Maybe this is one way."
5,The Treasure Trove of Eastern Christianity,"Western Christianity in its quest for a ""rational"" spirituality has lost the rich tradition of meditation and contemplation which was presevered in communities in the Mid-East since earliest times.This work introduces spiritual practices now seen as ""New Age"" or non-Christian oriental religious practice as bone fide early Chrisitan practices of our ancestors in faith.Reading this book will re-inforce that Christian spirituality must transform the totality of the human person: body, mind (rationality) and spirit."
1,"Wrong, very wrong!","I started to read just the introduction and I started to sense that something was wrong, very wrong. Besides the assumption of eco-feminism as compatible with Orthodoxy, he discusses the occult he was deeply involved with in terms that made me more than uncomfortable: admiration, an ambassador's tone in describing occult matters, almost reminiscent of patriotism. This is the sort of thing one should speak of out of deep humility spurred by repentance from serious sin.This is the first time I have purchased a book that I thought was Orthodox theology and didn't get past the introduction before regretting I'd made the purchase.If you wonder, ""Does this critic have anything better to say?"" then <a href=""http://www.amazon.com/author/cjshayward"">I invite you to visit my own author's section.</a>"
2,Cmpared to the Magus of Strovolos,"This book is not a total loss, but lacks in search for orthodox spirituality. The author turned preacher became an accepted pupil by the master. And then the breakup with the master. Ever since this author is flapping around in the wind, trying to recapture his original momentum with the Magus. He has flipped from researcher into an idiot in my eyes. But read it if you want to waste your time. There are remnants of Greek philosophy on Cypros, once the stronghold of the Knight's Templar."
5,Profound and Informative,"As a Roman Catholic graduate student in philosophy of religion/theology, I rarely find books on spirituality/religion that are written for non-academic audiences to be much good. This book, however, is a notable exception. Its exposition of Eastern Orthodox spirituality (especially hesychasm and the Jesus Prayer) is moving and clearly written. Usually, Western Christendom has spoken condemningly (if at all) of hesychasm. This book opens up the deep, Christocentric, ancient practices of Eastern Orthodox monasticism for anyone to see and understand. I found much in this book to challenge me and surprise me. I cannot recommend it strongly enough for anyone who is interested in taking a good, long look at practices of prayer and Easter Orthodoxy. A must-read for Christians."
4,France,Great! Not only the negative side of the Marie Antoinette was mentioned but also a good analysis
4,My kid is ok with it but prefers Kids Favorite Songs,When we got Kids Favorite Songs my 18 month old wanted to watch it over and over and over and though he doesn't talk yet he could easily hum most of the songs and we felt we had to get Kids Favorite songs 2 but he isn't as enthusiastic about it as the first. It's a little advanced for his age maybe he will grow into it but for younger kids the first definitely much better and easier to sing along too.
4,My 18 month old loves this video!,"I bought this DVD for my daughter for Christmas and she absolutely loves it. When I ask if she'd like to watch the Elmo movie she starts dancing around and giggling. Her favorite part is Snuffy singing ""On Top of Spaghetti"" and when the meatball falls off the plate she throws her hands in the air and yells, ""oh no!"" And then she starts ""sneezing"". She does loose interest somewhere in the middle but it provides me with a great distraction for her while I make dinner."
5,Best Video Ever!!,"My son is 18 months old and lives by this video!! He rolls a ball across the floor and calls it his meatball as he crawls to get it like Mr. Snuffaloughogus. I thought he wouldnt like all the kids who sing their favorite songs, but I think he likes to watch the other kids. It has a lot of great songs to sing along with and it taught me some new ones to sing with him too. I find Sesame STreet a good learning tool for those who allow their children to watch tv. Obviously, its worked in my case since my son repeats things he sees on the show. Highlyrecommended by a greatful mom.Billy's Mom"
2,A little scarey,"This video scared my son so much we had to throw it out, at his insistance. There is a giant run away meatball from the ""on top of spaghetti"" song that appears thoughtout the show which scares him so much he doesn't even want his little sister to watch it. I'll admit this is probably an extreme reaction but just wanted people to be aware that it could scare other kids."
1,Very disappointing video,"This video focuses on children trying to sing their favorite songs. You don't see very many Sesame Street characters; it's mostly about other children. It lost my son's attention (14 months old) almost immediately.The first video (Kids' Favorite Songs) shows Sesame Street characters singing, and he loves this."
5,LOVES IT!!!!!,MY son absolutly loves this video!!!! He liked the first one and I saw the second and he was so happy. I think that he likes the kids in this one. He laughs when they laugh and starts dancing to the songs. I would HIGHLY recommend this video.
3,..,"sesame street is still one of my favorites,even at 31 but this was kind of a lack luster hodge podge of songs,nothing terrible but nothing too exciting either"
3,Kids Favorite Songs 2,"I purchased this video because my 5 mos. old daughter absolutely loves Elmo and laughs and smiles when she sees his face, so we were a bit dissapointed that he wasn't in every frame. She doesn't seem that interested in the other characters yet. Great songs but we wanted more Elmo.We really enjoyed Best of Elmo since it's all about him."
1,We're dissapointed...,"My kids (age3, boy & girl) love ''KIDS FAVORITE SONGS'' video . So I purhased this video for them. We do not want to watch an interview program! I want to give my kids song video. I had been deceived by that title."
3,Sesame Street songsAlthough,"Although plays well on a computer, cannot play out of USA region on TV.Kids love to singalong to Sesame st songs.If you buy it make sure you buy for the European region"
2,"Not engaging, obnoxious and loud",Not enough Elmo and Sesame Street characters. It's mostly little kids singing and not very clearly so if you want to teach your little ones the songs it won't work. My kids didn't like it either.
3,Run away meatball....,I bought this dvd to try and get my 1 yr old to watch something other than Bob the Builder. In the beginning he liked the show but as he got a little older he became afraid of the run away meatball that keeps appearing throughout the show which at the end almost gets elmo. Now when I put it on I have to skip the part where the meatball almost flattens elmo.He loves sesame street now but is still scarred of that meatball. If you get this for your child watch their reaction and don't let them get scarred buy it. My son is now afraid of anything that is coming toward him.
4,"""Come Back Meatball, Come Back!""","Ok, so Elmo is in this one. But my 1-yr old breaks into the most adorable smile when he sees that funny little red puppet, so I don't mind. Good songs that even yet-to-utter-their-1st-word kids will enjoy. It also includes the famous Ernie ""Rubber Ducky Song"". Enjoy!"
2,Not as good as the first one,"I was very disapppointed with this DVD. We loved the first Kid's Favorite Songs so we were really looking forward to the second one. They spent too much time interviewing little kids and too little time actually singing the songs.Don't waste your money on this one. I highly recommend Kids Favorite Songs (1), The Best of Elmo, and Do the Alphabet."
3,Not nearly as good as the first one!,"My two-year-old son loved the first version, so I bought the second. He and I both were not impressed. It doesn't keep his attention at all and when I put it on, he says, ""no, no"". My son LOVES Elmo and he loves music, but this is just not one of their better shows."
3,Kids' Favorite Songs 2 Review,We have both part 1 and part 2. Part 2 has too much talk and not enough singing. Our toddler looses attention quickly while watching this.
3,Not like Favorite Songs 1,"My two-year old loves Favorite Songs 1 and sits through the entire show. However, he easily gets bored with this video and will leave to do something else. Maybe older preschoolers like the interaction with the kids, but not my toddler."
4,My son loves this DVD!,"My 21-month old loves this DVD. He loves Elmo in general & I think he likes seeing other kids singing songs. They could've made it a tad longer, in my opinion. I taught him to march around when ""The Ants go Marching 1 by 1"" song comes on & he thinks that's really fun. He only gets bored during the lullaby so we often skip over that one. I would recommend it though. It's good clean fun and teaches them songs."
1,Unimpressed!,"We have the first video Kids Favorite Songs, which my son just adores. I was so thrilled to find out that there was a second edition, and bought it for Christmas. It is terrible. He could care less about this video. It is not entertaining at all since they use mostly kids that can't sing, and hardly any puppets like the first one. Very dissapointed and a waste of money. Do not recommend!"
2,Misleading Cover,I bought this DVD for my toddler because he loves Grover more than any character on Sesame Street. I was disappointed that Grover nor Cookie Monster who were both on the cover were in film at all. Very misleading! Also a bit heavy on kids talking and singing their favorite songs not as much characters and muppets as there should be. Not very entertaining as far as Sesame Street DVDs go. Better spending your money on another title.
2,Audio Book Review,This is a review meant solely for the audio version of the book. the book itself is very good and i was looking forward to hearing a reading of it as i am a big fan of audio books. i was disappointed to hear that it was just a simple text to speech made by a computer. this was not worth the money and i feel as though i have been taken advantage of. it sounds like a robot reading it and for the price if someone was going to be lazy and use a program they could have spent what i paid for one copy and gotten a realistic sounding program. WARNING LOW QUALITY READING
2,not for moral readers,"I know this is something of a ""classic,"" but readers should be forwarned that in this book, the hero frequents prostitutes and seduces a married woman (actually he tries to seduce three of them). The affair takes up about 50-100 pages with references to it later in the book as well.There are good parts to this book. The very beginning is interesting, and one can find interesting material throughout the book. But at a certain point, the main character starts visiting women of ill repute and starts seducing married women. It was at this point that I started wondering, ""What kind of person was Abe Cahan if he could write about such matters in such detail? And what kind of morals did Cahan have if he makes this affair seem somewhat wonderful, rather than dastardly?""Be forewarned!"
1,Astonishingly Poor Re-mastering!,"I cannot believe that this imported product by Universal Music, that contains many of the most important recordings by the Four Tops would be ruined by poor digital re-mastering. The volume level for all of the tracks is low and the sound is thin and tinny. I own another Universal Motown GOLD SERIES box by Martha and the Vandellas and it is re-mastered at 24 bit and the sound is amazing. It is because of the Vandellas collection that I purchased this Four Tops set and instead of getting a real winner, I get a gigantic loser. It is so true that you can't judge a book by it's cover. Now that I have spent my money on this CD I notice that all of the other Motown Gold series critiques on Amazon have 5 star ratings except for this one which has no ratings at all. Poor sound is the reason. Well, you now have my rating of 1 star."
2,Difficult read,"Tough to be critical of a classic, but this book will not be finished! There is little context and .frankly, it makes my head hurt just trying to read it."
2,This novel is a very burdensome read and confusing!!,I found this book incredibly burdensome and confusing. Could someone please decipher the manuscript so a reader may be able to comprehend the message that Mr. Joyce was espousing. Thank you for the consideration. I understand the general structure but the language is convoluted and abstact. Maybe with a little help i will be able to understand the underlying theory.
5,Brilliant,"I can say quite honestly that this is one of the best books I have ever read, though I'm useless at placing books in top-10 charts. Most books I've read have something, Ulysses has more or less everything. I recommend the use of notes of some kind, especially for the ""Oxen of the Sun"" chapter, but I think people shouldn't be too frightened to dive straight in, it's really not such a big bad scary monster!"
3,I'd give it 5 stars were there not the book I'm reading now,"If you enjoy Ulysses because you want to be intellectually challenged, then I recommend a more challenging and eye-opening book, called, ""Get Real: A Philosophical Adventure in Virtual Reality."" It's brand new! I believe it will become 21st-Century's bible of human understanding in the context of electronic revolution. There are many exciting stories in the book, and those stories are going to enlighten you for good!"
5,the minor proves the major,"Is Ulysses the greatest novel of the century?Yes, surpassing all other literary endeavors in scope, depth, and intelligence.Is it unintelligible?No, nor is it undecidable, but only pointedly, significantly ambiguous.Why this quality?So that the reader must work as hard (if not harder)than the author himself did when composing the novel. And it is a composition.Why should the reader work?So that he/she might learn something substantial; so that he/she will be able to view the world with a new mind's eye.Does it suffice to read the book only once and quickly?Nope.Diagnosis for anyone who assigns the book less than five stars:idler; incapable of intense intellectual effort; probably likes vonnegut."
5,Operatic!,"This, as it is for many, is a wonderful and challenging read, forcing you to work at reading at creating and meeting up with the author in this wonderful and truly rich fiction that truly is fiction in all senses - not following but breaking up, re-casting fictional elements as he goes. Fiction is not doing this challenging, and upsetting of fictional expectations so much I find, and when I come across any writer who does I have to read and read them over - for fear of how long it will be until I next meet with something that challenges, that moves things... recently I have enjoyed Ben MarcusNotable American Women: A Noveland also Jayne Joso'sPerfect ArchitectANDSoothing Music for Stray Cats- I strongly recommend both authors and these works - after your 1st or 3rd reading of our wonderful Joyce."
1,Kindle Edition unreadable,"Aside from the other flaws pointed out, it doesn't have any chapter breaks. If Amazon doesn't want a good edition available for free for the Kindle, that's their business, but that this one comes up first on the search page sullies the reputation of the Kindle, of free books available over the Internet, and of Ulysses itself. (I'm not going to say Ulysses isn't a challenging read, but it's an impossible one here.)"
4,Abridged!!!,"This review is specifically for the Naxos AudioBooks production of Ulysses. Nowhere on the Amazon website (although I have now requested this change) does it say that this audiobook is ABRIDGED! The quality of the performances are so far outstanding, but it was disconcerting, to say the least, to be in the middle of Book I and suddenly be transported to Book IV. I purchased the audiobook to help me as I read through the book itself, so to that extent the audiobook abandoned me just when I needed it most, as Book III is rather arduous. It is still worth it to me since the only other audiobook is going for almost $150, and as I'm reading the book in its entirety I will not be limited to the abridged story. However, I was disappointed and wanted to give others a heads up."
3,book,"Good copy, although for me I needed something with largerprint ( to accomodate my ""over sixty"" eyeballs.)"
3,NOT JIM NORTON BUT GET THE DONAL DONNELLY AUTHORIZED RECORDING,"Jim gets a little carried away like Pacino chewing carpets. If you like that kind of thing, well, it wears thin with repeated listening. For instance in chapter one he really gets into a Vincent Price reading Poe mode at ""let me be and let me live"". and the intrusive intro music, fahggetabowdidinstead get the excellent and very listenable DOnal Donnelly recording, very well done with the corrected text. I listen to it repeatedly and constantly, and meanings emerge very gratifyingly. JOyce is to be heard rather than seen (the ineluctable modality of the visible), and often and forever. As for the the Dubliner stories, again pass by Norton and go for Setlock on Commuter's Library audiobooks. UNfortunately is still only on tape, but the subtley of his tempered readings bear repeated and gratifying listening. Save Norton for the stage. Joyce is forever and ever."
2,Imperfect text,"I suppose I shouldn't complain much at 95 cents, but the text has a disconcertingly high error rate. There are no italics, verse is not offset, there are scattered typographical errors, and I've found a few instances where stray numbers appear in the text. Also, I'm only three chapters in.If you are unfamiliar with this book and care about these things, you might want to look elsewhere."
3,Alright,"I'm 14 years old and I am halfway through the book. I took people's advice and am taking it one chapter at a time, and then discussing it with a friend of mine. I'm not really into books, but I love to push myself. After every chapter I need to research a little, and look words up in the dictionary. I would recommend this book to a dedicated reader who is prepared to work hard and use their head constantly."
1,This edition is an incomplete text!,"This edition omits most everything that appears in the print edition centered in the page, i.e. the poetry and songs like ""The Ballad of Joking Jesus,"" noted by other reviewers. Utterly unacceptable for a book written with care to every word."
3,Very Challenging,"Mr. Joyce should be commended for writing a book which obviously needs careful interpretation to be understood. Simple things are not always best.The most important questions which the novel raises, for this reader, is: To what extent is literary criticism a rigorous discipline? I'm sure one can place interpretaions on the way Joyce uses language, and what he alludes to: but how many other, competing, interpretations can one put upon it and can one credibly say that one interpretation is (in any sense) better than another?And if the answer to the first question is ""a great many"" and the answer to the second is ""no"", then is not literary criticism as much a fiction as that which it surveys?"
3,Tepid waters,"This novel was OK, but I didn't feel like it was speaking to me. Then again, I was reading it in a VERY dark room, and I didn't pause for lunch. This is a long book."
1,Unreadable,"This is not a story. This is nonsense. Other reviewers who called it ""unreadable"", ""verbal flatulence"", ""emetic"", ""well nigh incomprehensible"", are spot on correct. Unless you really hate yourself, do not attempt to read this book."
1,This is a literary masterpiece???????,"The book consists of an overabundance of mini-stories that are irrelevant to each other and there is no real plot. If you took this book into a publisher nowadays, he or she would probably throw it at you and then laugh in your face. I had to have been published on a dare, then banned as a publicity stunt. If you want to read it, I would suggest going to the library. Don't waste your money."
1,Not for ebooks,"Ulysses is a book that must be held, not battery powered. I doubt James Joyce would like his books as ebooks. Any more than Shakespeare, Ovid, Milton, Boethius, Sartre, Shelley, Kazantzakis or Tobias would. It's not an appropriate fit. These authors transcended the instantaneous, the inelegance of electricity. They wrote by candle-light, just as Nureyev danced by candlelight."
1,Pretentious intellectual self-absorption,"I was tempted to write this review after reading the other reviews. It seems that most readers had to struggle through it or use Cliff Notes. In short, it seems many succumbed to the peer pressure that it was a ""great"" book and that they just ""had"" to read it. It puts me in mind of someone going to an art gallery full of atrocious modern art and faking that they liked it to show how sophisticated they are. The truth is this book stinks.For one thing it is vulgar, which, I hate to disappoint anyone, requires no talent at all. This is a talent any six year-old boy possesses. Is the wordplay clever? Yes, too clever. James Joyce must have been incredibly pleased with himself.(...)himself."
4,"""Fast Who?"" Critques Joyce","Apparently drowning in a sea of Hollywood treatments and modern corporate literature's cheap formulaic approach to life, cheap disgusting Paso Robles wine, and the American penchant for telling it like it ain't; i too can fail to conquer intellectual challenges and then run off a series of prep school insults.Just because the Emperor is naked, doesn't mean he is dumb. When one experiences such a massive failure of imagination and intellect as some here, do what the corporate clowns of quasi capitalist/fascists' tell you to do, and medicate the problem away.Alternatively make the effort to understand, or to understand that you do not understand, Ulysses by James Joyce"
4,How can you judge?,"How can this book be compared to others when it is so different? It has very little exciting plot. From what I have read of Joyce he has little imagination for pulling the reader to the edge of his or her seat, and keeping the reader up for hours past his or her bed time waiting to see what happens next. He does, however, have great knowledge of english language among other things, and uses it well. I LOVED reading this book, but not because of how much better it is than all other books (because it isn't), but because I couldnt wait to see what all of the fuss was about! You should definately get it for the same reason. By the way, Random House, the company that rated it number one has sole publishing rights to Ulysses."
5,joyce is beyond all else,"For someone to revolutionize an artform is unique. But James Joyce did it with every book that he wrote. It is too bad he only wrote four but i guess between Ulysses and Finaganns Wake, a reader could spend his life decifereing them. On to Ulysses: this book is incredible. It is like a puzzle that is too large and complex to ever be finished, but at the odd moment that two pieces fit together, it is a revelation that sparks the mind and soul. Probibly the greatest peice of art that i have ever absorbed but to readers beware; it is more an art than a typical novel. Poetry, prose and passage all in one with spiritual interpretation to be discovered and shakspeare to be dissected. if you love the english language than read this book with an open mind and a hopeful heart. The book that shows the diversity of our language."
4,I Admit I've Tried and Tried and Tried....Can't finish it!,"Having tried and read many sections of this one, but never from beginning to end, plus having read innumerable reviews, and browsed thru all kinds of analyses of it, I can only conclude that it is generally way over-rated..Think of all the near-unknown great books by authors who are hardly recognized, who have written mythological, historical ""Days in the Life"" Novels..OK, so Molly gets excited at the end, and we witness a shaving scene in the beginning, with everything in between. Even as a fairly knowledgable literacy person, it is about impossible to read this without a reference guide. All in all simply very over-rated..However, PORTRAIT OF THE ARTIST is a beautifully done book, truly worthy of its lofty reputation, so my suggestion is to read PORTRAIT , plus the stories first, and if frustrated by this one, simply move to something else! There are literally thousands and thousands to choose from!"
5,If you want to know more...,"If you loved what you heard from Norton and Riordan but want to know more about the literary bones and puzzles in Joyce's Ulysses, I highly recommend the course ""Joyce's Ulysses"" taught by James A.W. Heffernan of Dartmouth. It is only available from The Teaching Company and it goes on sale once a year. Listen to the book several times before you listen to Professor Heffernan. The Heffernan lectures will greatly increase your understanding of the work."
3,Actually...,"...there are two kinds, not species of people. The kind who can like or dislike a book and articulate why; and those who can't articulate anything and resort to name-calling and insults.I enjoyed Ulysses. Wasn't an easy read, and I don't like the idea that you have to buy a guide to appreciate all the nuances; but all in all it's worthy of the veneration we heap on it as a truly modern novel."
3,Perhaps the pseudo-intellectual's literary bible,"I am on the last 100 pages of - what is in all liklihood - the hardest book I have ever read. How I feel about the book is still in question. Some parts I have found very poetic, lyrical, truthful, and yes! even slightly titillating; but, I must say, the vast majority of the book I think is not so much as boring as it is protracted and useless. However, with all due credit to Joyce, it's always honest. Very honest! I found Joyce's other work ""Portrait of the Artist..."" far more readable and inspiring. So, I don't thinks it's being unfair to Joyce when one says that Ulysses is extremely over-rated. Furthermore the novel seems to have a sort of literary snob appeal for those pseudo intellectuals (and/or Joyce-devotees) who feign some sort of intellectual epiphany from the experience of reading it. For them, yet perhaps another way to separate themselves from the ""unappreciative, uninitiated, unenlightened reading masses."""
3,There should be a law...,"....against making different printings of the same book with different page numbers. In this book, they solve the problem by having page numbers from the first edition in the margins across from that page's original bottom line. Still, there are several editions of this book (and countless other books) where the pagination does not match up. This can be terribly annoying if you are in an English / literature class and everyone has a different edition of the book. Someone says ""turn to page 37"", and every page 37 is different. I think when the book publishers want to issue a new edition, they should copy the pages from an old edition using the photo-offset process. This is my personal pet peeve and probably has nothing at all to do with the actual novel by Joyce, but I can't really speak on that issue because I haven't read the book yet. When I do, I will update this ""non""-review and make it more informative."
2,Audio Book Version,"I am not commenting on the work, just this audiobook version.Poor production and dynamic range. I have the abridged version of this audiobook and sometimes the narrator speaks so softly that I have to turn the volume up and then a moment later he speaks so loud it hurts my ears. I have never had this happen with a Recorded Books audio book. Inexcusable.Also they put in some singing/opera clips. Hey, I came to hear the book not some other stuff the producer decided to put in."
1,Awful,"Indecipherable rubbish.I bought this door stop because it is on everyone's list of Great Books. I read 200 or so pages and had to stop, I'd rather have a root canal without anesthesia than read the rest of it. I am a college educated English major, but how this random witlessness can share a shelf with Steinbeck, Vonnegut, Hemingway, Orwell or Forster and a number of other fine authors escapes me."
2,Ulysses,"I'm sorry to say I didn't know what was going on about 85 percent of the time while reading this book. I even read ""Portrait of the artist"" before this one. The only thing it helped me with was recognizing Stephen Dedalus' name. I can't recommend this book."
1,This book is WAY overrated...definitely NOT the #1 book ever,"I know the Modern Library picked this as the #1 book of all-time, which was one of the reasons I chose to read it. However, I was sorely disappointed in it. I like books that I can read without having to scrutinize every page in abhorring detail. A book like Huckleberry Finn is a very readable book that I can read on one level and my son on another and both take a lot away from it. A book like Ulysses has only one level, and it's way to deep to enjoy. The ""story"" gets lost in the chaff. I have never used Cliff Notes in my life, but was forced to buy them about halfway through this book and was surprised to find some ""obvious"" things I missed. If you want a good book, read Frankenstein, Huck Finn, any Dickens, etc but skip this ""classic"" and leave it to those folks who like to disect a book and not enjoy it..."
5,A 45 hour trip for a first time reader of Ulysses,"I offer the following advice. Read Ulysses while listening to the Donnelly, Healy-Louie narrated audio-book. Other reviewers suggested reading aloud, which is good advice, but this excellent audio version of the book will greatly improve your reading experience and understanding."
4,Ulysses,"Those who hold Ulysses up as some kind of uber-novel do it as much disservice as those who toss it aside as ""trash"" without giving it a second thought. Is it the greatest novel of the twentieth century? Who cares? What it is, certainly, is a work rooted in the depths of writing, a work labored over by a very intelligent man for years on end, and a work which deserves more thought than some are willing to give it credit for. The simple fact that a novel must be digested and thought about does not make it ""obscure,"" nor is it, ""worthless."" It can be enjoyed by all who are willing to think about it. Writers like Carver who can demonstrate beauty in the simplicity of their writing have their place in the corpus of the English language, but so do writers like Joyce, whose complexities weave around themselves and ask us to consider the possibilities of our language in a different sense. To cast this book aside as meaningless does a disservice to the writer and the reader."
2,I really dont get it,"I know I am only 13 years old and I do not wish to offend anybig Ulysses fans, but I had no idea what this book was on about? I will reread it perhaps in 30 years and appreciate it more. However, for the time being, those who proclaim it the greatest book of the century only have to read any of The Lord of the Rings, Catch-22, 1984 or To Kill a Mockingbird to see they are sadly mistaken END"
3,...,"So we all know that Ulysses is amazing, best novel of the 20th century. And the Gabler edition is the most accurate version out there. But let's talk about the quality of the Gabler edition. While I was reading a brand new copy of this book, 20 of the pages completely fell out! I had to be careful not to bend the binding too much while reading it. I would suggest looking for this in hardcover or see if any other publisher has printed a copy of Gabler."
3,OMG!,"This is the most abjectly unreadable tome I've ever worked my way through. It's impossibly dull, tedious, and just plain boring. And then it soars. Orgasmic. And then you plod on for page after page after page after page. Glad I read it. Don't think it's one that I'm likely to ever tackle again, though!"
2,Readers Are Idiots,"I didn't think I'd be writing books reviews 30 years after leaving school. But... There is a certain class of author -- George Meredith was one of the first to express this viewpoint -- who has the opinion ""if you can't figure out what this is all about in the first chapter, you are intellectually unworthy to read my book."" That is arrogance of the first order. Joyce, Faulkner (in some cases), and others of the ""I'm too deep for you, dummy"" school have massive good press from academics. Books like this keep them in tenure, one can devote a whole semester to explaining what is happening on Bloomsday. If you don't have to read this book, you shouldn't bother. Good books don't have to be 'literary', just have to be readable and make sense. There are of course good moments in Ulysses, especially if you have ever been to an Irish pub, but you really have to dig for them."
2,Caveat Emptor: Buyer (of the Kindle edition) beware,"The electronification of James Joyce's Ulysses hasn't quite got it yet: this Kindle edition is full of typos and odd punctuation. If you're planning on reading Joyce, you'd be better off with the hard copies for now; with maybe a free e-edition on your Kindle to supplement it, for those times when you're standing in line at the grocery store and can't be bothered to carry around 2 pounds of excellent literary deadweight."
3,Vintage copy!,"I recieved a copy of this book printed in the sixties! While I think it is very cool, I definitely think it should have been considered ""Acceptable"" not Good or Very Good. It's a little fragile looking, but it will make a lovely addition to my bookshelf anyway."
2,A bit unwieldy,"Ignoring the fact that I've had it a year and only made it to page 100...the format of the book is a bit odd. It's quite a large book, and the organization of the text on the page is very overwhelming. It's like a big, poorly published textbook. Perhaps this is what Joyce wanted..."
3,Comparison of Ulysses ebooks,"Looking at the sample chapters of the 99c MobileReference edition, I notice an entire missing paragraph (after ""and chanted:""). The chapter breaks are poorly formatted, and other typos include a small 'i' for 'I' and a period for a comma.The $1.29 edition touted as ""w/ Active Table of Contents and Chapter Navigation"" is blatantly false advertising-- the 18 chapters aren't indicated in any way, just the three 'books'. The indentation of paragraphs is inconsistent. (Why is there no publisher listed?)The anonymous $3.99 edition (ASIN: B0019NGLNC) has unreadably awful formatting, and no TOC."
5,"Definitive, Unadulterated","Compared to other editions of Ulysses, this one does not take the needless and mildly obnoxious liberties with the text that certain other editions have--no fancy typography and unnecessary section dividers to be found here. This is (thus far) the unchallenged, definitive edition, with helpfully numbered chapters and the corresponding Odyssey chapter titles in the table of contents. The introduction and forward, while in no way revelatory, are informative and interesting enough."
2,"Remarks on the object, not the work itself","Notwithstanding disputes on the editorial choices, the main reason to get this particular edition is the fact that the guide by Don Gifford makes reference to its line numbering. The Gifford book is an indispensable companion to Ulysses. However, the large format, relatively small print and miserable binding are deplorable. Once you get to Molly's monologue, you almost have to detach the pages one after the other. Maybe not so great for the inescapable rereading of this masterwork!"
4,Why wade in James Joyce's stream of consciousness?,"There is no doubt that James Joyce is a master of the english language, with an endless knowledge of western culture. He takes a postmodernist stream of consciousness method of writing to its highest limits...but is that saying much?_Ulysses_ meanders about like a day dream. I, for one, hate the postmodernist approach to writing. You may consider me biased on this count. Give me a logical plot any day!"
4,This is a Great Book,"The last 200+ pages of this book were fantastic, including the night scenes in town. I have not read English poetry and therefore was lost for an earier 200 pages. Joyce's references to Parnell were interesting, as was the singular reference to U.S. Grant. Leopold Bloom is an example, I suppose, of the exception to the single mindedness of these Irish people. Dublin was a lovely city, however, clearly not diverse enough for Joyce. I liked this book for the exposure given me to the English language. Joyce was a master with the pen (as was Paul). Do I read Finnegan's Wake? How can I not?"
2,Ulysses,This book is a struggle. I don't know where it's going and can't decide if I want to be there at the finnish.
4,Great Quality,This book came on time and in great condition. It is a perfect edition to my collection of leather bound books and amazes my little sister every time she sees it because it is so beautifully kept. Thank you.
4,Not available in Europe?!,"Shouldn't James Joyce: Ulysses be available in the free edition for Europeans as well?!After having purchased a Kindle for use in Europe (at a much higher price of course), I find it really irritating and weird that some of the free 'classics' are not available in Europe. Hope this will change soon..."
1,uggghhhhh,"uggghhhh, after nine months i finally finished this rambling, incoherent string of words.i took this book on because i'm reading the 100 best books of the 20th century (as defined by the modern library). i had read about 20 already before taking on this 'project'. so why not start at number 1? big mistake.when i bought it, i had no idea what it was about, and i actually became excited when i heard that it loosely followed the odyssey. was i ever disappointed. this book just kept rambling and rambling. 2/3rds of the way through i still didn't know what was going.the only reason i know anything about this book (even after finishing it) was because i went on the internet and found 'ulysses for dummies' - a cartoon depiction of the book. my suggestion, save yourself 9 months and read 'ulysses for dummies'whoever listed this as number 1 was smoking too much crack - since i can't afford a nine-month crack habit, i guess i'll never be able to truly appreciate it."
1,Obfuscation incarnate!,"I had to read this (years ago) because I took English as a minor when I was an undergraduate. I cringe at the memory and the heated discussion I had with the professor (a Joyce fanatic). Now as a librarian I decided to give it another attmept, trying to keep an open mind. I have to give Joyce points for being clever and kudos for verbosity. After struggling through it again, I had to ask myself what was the point? Most of the book strikes me as an attempt by the author to show how very clever he was with word play and analogy and practically every other literary devise under the sun.To me as a reader, literature requires something more than an exercise in erudition or diction. I may be in a distinct minority here, but I still dislike Joyce for inflicting such a circus upon readers."
3,Just the begining,"I have read only a few pages. It is fantastic the sensibility of the writer for words. He loves it, he caresses it, he talks to the words, as if words were persons.It is something cryptic and in intriging. Just in the begining. when Mulligan says ""Introibo ad altare Dei"", I understood the innuendo, because I was educated in the catholic religion and, besides, by the jesuits...and Mulligan says that Dedalus is a ""jesuit"". But not everybody is, or was, catholic... Besides, I have some difficulties with words that the writer is creating, or, at least, are not in any dictionary, as ""snotgreen"". I will continue."
1,Everybody's favourite pitch,"There are few books that could actually change your life, as in change the way you view artistic creativity, and Ulysses is one of them; reason being because Ulysses is the bible for modern writers in its unparalleld absorption of culture and human folly. Typically, this novel is a university favourite as there is so much to discuss, unravel and admire.I don't see how anybody can say that Ulysses is their favourite read. Like all of Joyce's works it is not particularly warm and, for me, wasn't a work to inspire and enflame the spirit. As you all know, or should know, Ulysses is the most important fictional text of the 20th century and that in itself makes it worthwhile to the patient reader."
2,"Ulysses, Jame Joyce","The book came promptly, but the condition was not ""very good""as described. It also is paged differently from other Ulysses books used in my course. This makes it difficult to find sections that the class is discussing."
2,This book makes me feel stupid,"I was so disspointed with this book considering i read and enoyied Dubliners and Portrait of a Artist as a Young Man and it is on alot of best books of all time list. The reason i liked Joyce's previous work is that both are not too long, he was a good writer and i am against the catholic church so any book that critizes it is okay with me. With his other books you really did not mind the parts when nothing really happens and his heavy prose style. But trying to read Ulysses is such a chore you end up scratching your head and having to read passages over and over again untill you get it. I gave up after after 300 pages and just went to [...] to read the study guide instead."
1,"""What he's saying, I know not...""","Having gotten through ""Portrait of the Artist"" and ""Dubliners,"" I can now say James Joyce has to be the most arrogant, overrated author EVER. For someone with so clearly a gift for language, he lacked one important thing: THE ABILITY TO TELL AN INTERESTING STORY. Without a plot, it's just a bunch of random thoughts thrown at the wall, which is what this giant pile of excrement truly is. Don't buy the hype, I've read dozens and dozens of books deemed 'classic' and I found most to be labeled so for good reason. James Joyce is NOT a great writer, and this proves it. Awful, just awful..."
1,A waste of your time,"Considered such a masterpiece - I HAD to read it. What a waste of time...First - the language: extremely difficult and archaic. Even for English speaking people. Can one enjoy a book if one needs a dictionary every couple of lines ?Then the allegedly 'cultural' riddles Joyce planted in the book for the sole purpose of torturing generations of English literature students and their teachers. Ask yourself - are you going to enjoy a book that neccesitates your literature teacher lie next to you and explain its 'sophistication' to you ? Every other page ?Then the foreign languages quotes in latin, german, irish, italian and who knows what else...Did Joyce expect his readers to be THAT fluent in other dialects ?Personally - I think Joyce wrote the book being completely drunk. Or worse.Last but not least - the story, the time frame and the main characters - boring, boring and then boring again.Your reading time could be used on much more pleasant, interesting books. Really."
5,Nothing could compare,"Ulysses is the greatest thing (in all of arts and sciences)ever created by a man. I have read it all the way through once, and have re-read the individual episodes plenty of times on their own. A whole part of my life was defined by the reading of this book. It is no small undertaking to construct a universe. Ulysses is more than a machine, more than an organism; Ulysses is a universe. If you want to read deeper into things (which of course you do, if you're reading this book), then the most indispensible of the commentaries is Stuart Gilbert's, which was written under Joyce's supervision."
2,Too little for too much,"Clearly, Joyce's work is a tour de force, an everyman's epic day hidden in grand literary style. The langauge varies from beautiful to impenetrable, with allusions galore. The themes were shocking in 1922, and portrayed in all of life's gory detail. But is it worth it?The time involved in reading (let alone understanding) this book is enormous, easily on the order of fifty hours. What does this steep admission price buy? Simply put, not enough. Their are a multitude of insights one can draw from Bloom's day, but their are none that aren't easier to gleen from other writings. The language, while beautiful at times, does not justify the investment, in my opinion. For a passionate lover of English langauge and literature, this book may be for you. But for the everyday reader, who reads for simpler pleasures and knowledge, you will probably get little out of this book but the right to say 'Yes, I have read Ulysses, Yes!'"
3,Comparison of Ulysses ebooks,The $[...] Old Landmark edition (ASIN: B000FCK4BS) has chapter breaks and a TOC but lacks italics and proper linebreaks in the verse.
2,I agree with Virginia Woolf,"Woolf was right. Joyce was obsessed with being, hm, obscure. I have read every book he wrote (not that many) and studied him at length. It has not helped. I cannot admire anyone who thinks we should have to work so hard to figure out what he was talking about. Normal people can't enjoy Joyce and I think this is a travesty. For all the hard work I had to do to figure out what he was talking about, I did not get one moment's enjoyment. Down with pretentious male modernists who feel we should all spend our lives ""working"" to unveil the ""true meaning"" in their words. For all you Joyceans out there who like to mock the ""commoners"" for not ""getting"" Joyce, I am working on a PhD in English--and I ""get"" him just fine, thank you. And I nonetheless refuse to give in to the pressure to like him. Brilliant as he may have been, he was full of himself. In my mind, these two qualities alone (brilliance and arrogance) should not get anyone's novels on the must-read lists."
3,"Interesting, but...","What many consider to be Joyce's masterpiece is, to be frank, by no means his best work. ""Ulysses"" takes Joyce's use of realism and disjointed language to an extreme that causes most readers to lose interest in the story and the messages contained within. No work in which the style causes the vast majority of the readers (even of the highly educated readers) to become disallusioned and pretty much sick of can be considered a true masterpiece. If one wants to understand Joyce's feelings on Dublin and its people (and consequently his feelings on the Universe in which we exist) should read a work such as ""The Dubliners."""
2,what am I missing,"I knew there was going to be trouble when I picked up the book in a St Louis airport book store and someone said something about me being a glutton for punishment. On the declaration of its being the greatest book of the 20th century, I had to see what the fuss was all about. And I still wonder, 167 pages or so later. Usually after about a hundred pages I can sort of get the ""gist"" of a document, and I will admit to not having a degree in literature or Irish studies. From all the praise, I am wondering if I have a defect in my brain. But I will admit, I don't get it. If this is supposed to be some mental time capsule, a masterful expose of stream-of-consciousness, then fine. Must be an acquired taste. Back to the Archie comic books I guess."
1,Soporific,I read somewhere that this book has been termed the greatest book of 20th century in American History. I absolutely have no clue why. I think its just a hype.This book is very dry in prose and its hard to keep reading for more than 10 minutes. For me its one of the most soporific books - it makes me doze off in a few minutes in the middle of insomnia.
1,James Joyce Needed an Editor,"How could a book like Ulysses ever have made it to print? The grammar is so disjointed as to make it nearly impossible to read. Additionally, the point-of-view and writing style change in nearly every chapter after the sixth. It should also be mentioned that the story is not very well paced. The book is well over 600 pages long, but the events in the story appear to take place over the course of just a single day.I have heard numerous people praise this book, but that would seem to be largely posturing because the story is lost under the weight of inadequate editing."
1,"Der, I like stories!","This is one of those books that ""smart"" people like to ""read."" Well if being smart means liking this, count me out! I don't know if it's modern, post-modern or what: but I know this much, I'd rather just curl up with ""Bridges of Madison County"" for a good cry! I don't understand why such a 'great' author can't seem to come up with a straightfoward plot that makes sense. I'd like to have seen Leopold patch things up with Molly, am I right? I mean, let's get down to brass tacks: don't we all hate those intellectuals who consider this one of the century's 'finest works of literary craft'? I mean these are the people who put ""Citizen Kane"" in the top ten...and totally ignored ""Life as a House""! (No offense, but Orson Welles is no Kevin Kline!) Unless Oprah puts it on her book list, I won't be picking this one up again, that's for sure."
1,"English writer,so how much you can expect from him?","What an awful book this is?When an English/American writer try to explain his/her ideas about life(I mention ideas about meaning,purpose and philosophy of life)and when he/she try to do this with complicated ideas and long sentences(or like very short ones especially in this particular book);what his/her work become to is:A tremendous nonsense!!!When you see a book like that I mentioned above(and I also warn you against it),all you need to do is:RUN,RUN, RUN AWAY!!!NOTE:My ideas about English/American writers doesn't concern Shakespeare."
5,Not For Everyone,"This is a fascinating book for those who have the patience and time to explore its intricate chapters and themes. Yet, it should not be forced upon anyone as required reading or for that matter anyone under the age of 21. The richess and complexity of the Circe episode alone earns a 5 star rating. Other episodes such as Cyclops, Ithica, Nausicaa and (of course) Penelope are memorable. There were times (Oxen of the Sun, Scylla and Charrybdis) that I just did not have the energy required to continue, but on the whole, a worthy venture.It particularly helps if you can identify with the eroding dreams of either Leopold Bloom or Stephen Deedalus. That is why it may appeal to those who their 20's just making their way out in life or those who middle aged such as myself, who reflect upon what has gone down and what is yet to come."
1,Do not buy the Simon & Brown Edition,"The Simon & Brown Edition is a poorly laid out version of the novel. It appears as if a print on demand (POD) publisher hastily assembled the book from Project Gutenburg or some other public domain source. There are inexplicable spaces between lines and paragraphs, the dialogue is bulleted and has no quotation marks, the page numbers are all on the bottom left of the page, etc. Overall an amateurish attempt. I am returning this version today."
3,Ulysses for Dummies,"Stubborn persistence was necessary to get me through this book. That's unusual for me because I love reading (the only major book I never finished was Miss MacIntosh, My Darling). My effort paid off, however; it allowed me to enjoy the hilarity of 'Ulysses for Dummies' on the web. For me, Ulysses was 5% brilliantly clever, 50% incomprehensible, and 20% boring. That doesn't add up since I skimmed some of it with glazed eyes. Yes, that 5% made the effort worthwhile, and 'Ulysses for Dummies' was a delicious dessert."
3,I am obviously just not educated enough.,"Wow. I didn't make it too far into this one. I personally found it virtually unreadable. I know it's a classic and everything but, just wow. Definitely has it's own style. Really must have ruffled some feathers back in the day!"
3,Borges and I,"Neither of us was able to get through this tome. For me, it had nothing to do with it being a difficult read; I simply was not rewarded enough to continue. Admirable, yes, but ultimately this is far from the finest novel of the English language.It is time to say it: the Emperor is not wearing any clothes. There are better books. Read Faulkner or Reinaldo Arenas."
1,This book is NOT annotated!,There are no notes in this book. It's just a copy of the text. Please title appropriately. That is all.
3,Love a lot - hate a lot relationship to this book,"The ultimate controversial book, maybe just behind the bible. Nothing can be said about it that hasn't already been discussed, and everything you may have already read about it is absolutely true: confusing read, snobbish pretentiousness, seminal masterwork, culmination of english literature, cult genius, modernist epitome, madman's soliloquy, beautiful narrative, a classic, waste of time, bag of crap. So it's just fair to rate it a well-deserved 3 stars, the just average to a work that can easily be described as sublime and profane, at the same time -- sometimes not even chapter to chapter but paragraph to paragraph. An absolute must-read for everyone, even though it's only for excersising your reading enduring habits."
2,not the best ever!,"I don't get how this book can be considered the best ever. I am a good reader and I found it almost impossible to read. The sentences(if they can even be called sentences) are all convoluted and then it breaks out in play format-what the hell is up with that? I'm sure it has tons of allegorical layers but whats the good of that when you can't tell what the hell is even going on.It seems that for a book to be considered great it has to have layers of meanings hidden that are very hard to figure out. But I'm sure that half of these ""great"" books are written with a meaning intended by the author and then the critics and readers assume that there is some great meaning behind everything so they make up something just to make sure they don't look stupid. These made up themes are then told to people who tell others and so on.Over all not worth the reading!"
1,"Can't Read It, Can't Hear It","Tried many times to read the book, thought maybe this would be better. It isn't. Nice package, though, and it will make a great doorstop."
2,Not Enough Suspense,"The author kept getting bogged down in details instead of moving the storyline along, because we don't need to know everything about the characters, just enough to keep reading until the climax of the story; if you compare it with something like the Hunt for Red October you'll see what I mean, there the author knows to advance the plot and doesn't waste his time and ours. Here there is way too much information when all the reader wants is to solve the plot and find out what happens. I expected it to be a lot more fast-paced because of the reputation.Also, where was the editor? A book shouldn't be hard to read but there were run-on sentences and bad grammar in some places."
2,Ulysses is Useless,"There is one great line in this book:""History is a nightmare from which I am trying to awake.""Unfortunately, the rest of it is unintelligible, tedious bunk. Save your time and energy for something like '1984' by George Orwell, a REAL twentieth century classic."
5,"""Ulysses"" by James Joyce - Gabler Edition",BOOK WAS IN LIKE-NEW CONDITION AND WAS PRICED AT $8.50 RATHER THAN $19.95 AT BOOK STORES.
1,Hugely dissapointing,"I bought this having been a huge fan of the cartoon series, but Mr Joyce has taken a winning formula and produced a prize turkey. After 20 pages not only had Ulysses failed to even board his spaceship, but I had no idea at all what on earth was going on. Verdict: Rubbish."
3,"Good, but far overrated","firdt off, college english professors, don't bombard me with hate mail (again) because I thought it was just okay, (my own give me that enough). this was an enjoyable read, but that does not make it great. Nor does the fact that it took him seven years to write or was not in ireland at the time, that is impressive, but the book is not. I am not just an uncultured blockhead, I love Joyce, Hemmingway, etc. but this book was not as good as his others. it is bland and pointless. yes he went through a lot to write this, but it took quite a lot to make star wars episode I, case closed"
2,Vintage's Gabler edition binding a disgrace,"While I think the Gabler edition of Ulysses is great, if you are looking to buy a new copy of it, please beware! In a class I taught, many students' books contained a considerable misprint in which 15 pages of episode 13 are reprinted in episode 14 (and 15 pages are missing from episode 14). The binding on recent printings is so poorly constructed, that within 4 weeks of class, 3/4 of my class's editions fell apart into a dozen clumps of roughly 50 pages each. We contacted the publisher, but Vintage customer service was indifferent to our problems. My own copy, from 1986, is still in one piece after years of use. If you want this edition (which I still recommend), try an older printing. Vintage's indifference to its own shoddy book production is unprofessional and inexcuasble. I'm posting this review Oct 2005, so I hope this warning will not be necessary at a future date."
3,I Did It!,"There is no reason in the world for me to write a review for this except to say ""I READ IT"". I live in the boonies of SE Oklahoma where there's not a soul who has heard of Joyce much less care whether anyone has read him or not. So, reader of Amazon's reviews, you're my (un)lucky audience. Not only did I read it, but I have not moved it to my ""Trade"" shelf. I want it as a reminder of how damned goofy I can be.If you are reading this because you are wondering whether to read it or not, then the answer is that you probably won't ""get it"" any more than I did. If you do read it and actually enjoy it, then you can consider yourself goofier than me.Seriously: 1. I didn't particularly like it. 2. I AM glad I read it. 3. If I ever pick it up to read it again, shoot me."
5,What a great rendition!,"I have listened in the past to the taped rendition of Ulysses, and I pushed my way through it for the bragging rights. This new version is just so superb and so amazing in its vitality.While at times Ulysses is still a challenge to grasp, I can guarantee that the whole book is much more comprehensible, and wonderful, to hear it read so well. It suddenly makes sense.As a by-the-way, the Naxos packaging is second only to Apple's iPod in the pleasure I got from handling it and opening it."
1,An exercise...,"Richard Ellman in his biography of the famous Dublin-born sponge, points out that Joyce was once asked why he was taking 12 years to write what would become Ulysses. Joyce was living in Europe, hitting up friends, relatives, and would be patrons for money as he masturbated away his talent right in front of the poor, half-wit woman he married. ""Because,"" he answered, ""I can't think of anything else to do."" That about sums up why this book in truth is an eruption of verbal flatulence, a screech in the literary void by a man who was not capable of doing what lesser writers could: compose a plot. There are scenes, passages and conversations from Ulysses that are truly brilliant--but that's all one can say about it. The tragedy is that a man of such talent, who would have secured a place in literary history if he had never written another word after ""The Dead"", felt obliged to labor his way through this doorstop of a novel, when he could have produced something so much better."
2,Italics are capitalized,"Substituting capitalization for italics is unacceptable. Also, multiline verses are collapsed into one unbroken line."
3,CD only,"Do not buy this CD to listen to in the car! The selections and interpretation of this abridged audio edition are unimpeachchable. However the reader, gifted with a clear and expressive voice, presents most of the narration sotto voce, which is inaudible on the road even at top volume."
4,not annotated,"This version is NOT annotated, in spite of the claim. The book itself is of course a classic of literature in the English language...but do not expect any annotations (and this is a book which would be much helped by annotations)."
1,text missing which is present in the project gutenberg edition,"I read a number of reviews pointing out that significant bits of text are missing from this edition, and often the reply is made that the present volume is probably based on the Project Gutenberg edition, and the text is probably missing from the Project Gutenberg edition as well.Well, I looked. In the first section Buck Mulligan chants in a ""happy foolish voice""--I'm the queerest young fellow that ever you heard.My mother's a jew, my father's a bird.With Joseph the joiner I cannot agree.So here's to disciples and Calvary.The text is in the P.G. edition, but is missing from the Kindle edition offered here. Amazon should remove this edition, it is a corrupt text falsely advertised as complete."
1,Such a wretched waste of time,"Yes, ULYSSES is a mainstay of college literature. Yes, the book is a worthy literary endeavor. But for those who are not brutally devoted to the endless pursuit of mind-numbing genius, ULYSSES is tiresome, tedious, and passe. The appeal of reading the mind wanderings of a pasty, weak pseudo-intellectual grows stale after the first dozen pages. For those enterprising readers such as myself who feel guilty dumping a Joyce work after only a chapter, read on. It gets worse. Confession: the genius mind-maze that is Joyce is sometimes just not worth exploring. One would have better luck escaping the Minotaur than successfully exiting this lingual labyrinth. (Dr. Marcus Smith: I apologize for this heresy against the Modern Epic.)"
4,A smart person's book,"Each book has its balance between prose and poetry and this book is almost all poetry. It actually doesn't have much of a plot, it's more of a stream of consciousness of his ruminations briefly punctuated by daily events. With all of the literary references, and breadth between Greek, Latin, Physics, Hebrew, French, etc., this is a smart person's book. More than anything, the author seems like someone you'd want to have at a dinner party."
2,Ulysses Audio Book,The problem with this audio book is that the sound is not balanced. The dialogue comes through loud and the right after dialogue the reader's words are so soft that it's difficult to hear. This audio book is not easily listened to even in a quiet car.
4,worth the tlme,"I will admit it took me atleast two times the amount of time to read this as most books but,it was worth the time. It's a supremely original novel."
2,Poor Edition,"This rating reflects the quality of the edition, not the work itself. There were many points in the text where letters where smudged, only half printed, covered by blots of ink, or otherwise rendered indistinguishable."
1,The death of literature,"With _Ulysses_, Joyce truly showed the world what a elitist egotist he was. Unfortunately, too many academics were entranced by occasional flourishes of vivid imagery to see this sham for what it was (and is): An intense act of laziness and hubris by a writer who had trouble telling stories. I think of _Ulysses_ as the precursor to all the self-indulgent pseudo-intellectual garbage that turned so many people off from reading ""great literature"" over the last 60 some odd years. However, the greatest tragedy comes from the fact that Joyce had talent in spades and showed it on occasion, such as with many of his short stories. If he would have tried to make _Ulysses_ even semi-comprehensible, it may indeed have been as great as some make it out to be. In the end, though, it's all just gibberish without a story to drive it."
5,British and Irish Cooking,"I have had this book for years and love it. Well, I've loved it to death - the pages are all falling out so I looked on line to see if I can replace it. The one copy costs $64 ! I don't quite love it THAT much, so will soldier on with the one I have. But, really, the recipes are authentic (I am British with some Irish roots too) and reliable and there is a good variety."
3,average,"Although the person I purchased the gift for loved it, I was only mildly impressed with the quality of the item. The felt lining in the case was peeling off, the case itself was dented and some of the chips were faded and chipped. I would have returned it if I had purchased it for myself."
3,Case cheap and broken,We had to return this item. Case was broken at one of the hinges. The inside of the case was cheaply made and over to far to one side.
3,Not what I was looking for,"I bought this poker set for my boyfriend for Christmas. I was just going to wrap it and wait for him to open it. I am happy to checked it out first. The mold inside the case was plastic and it did not even match up with the case, there was a good inch between them. The quality of the cards was not good and when I held the chip stacks by eachother they didn't match up. My dad said it would be a good starter poker set."
4,Pretty good poker chip set,"I was very satisfied when I got this product 3 days after I ordered it, I even had it on Super Saver Shipping! The case is very good. The chips feel nice and durable. They smell a little weird, but I don't mind. The cards aren't the best quality but they are usable. I haven't had any problems with this set. For the price, your getting a great product."
4,"Good value, some suggestions for improvement","Got this on time. Good value for the money...about $41.62...a few suggestions to improve it:1. The box was dented a bit under the handle...looks like pressure of the handle dented it. Not a big deal, but the packing could be made better so the handle does not press on the box during shipping.2. Both card sets are the same color so easily get mixed up. Using two sets of different colored cards would be an easy improvement.3. The box is a little flimsy and the coins are too heavy for the box. Slight improvement here will help.Overall value good for the price. Cheers!"
2,buy in store!,"i highly suggest that you buy poker chips in store so you can easily touch the chip and examine the quality. poker chips are all about the feel in your hand. you can't determine that from a picture from the internet, they all look similar but can feel lousy once you pick one up. also, it's easier to return to a store than internet. these chip sets are heavy & expensive to ship.please note; heavier poker chips feel better. 11.5g is the minimum weight to buy. although, i suggest you get 13.5g or 14g chips. good luck on your game!"
2,Product arrived damaged,Purchased the set for a family member as a Christmas gift. He seemed impressed with the chips but the inside of the case was completely destroyed. The weight of the chips are too much for the very cheaply made insert that goes inside the case. I would look else where and save yourself the hassle.
3,Poor Chip Quality...,"Length:: 0:48 MinsDa Vinci 500 Chip Poker Set video commentary...may be hard to tell in video, but dull chip color, bad decall printing and color consistency on the dealer and blind buttons."
1,not what it describe. when i actually had found out the chip is different when i had open the chip n making sure..,i'm not happy what i have order from here. Literally chip are color out ...seem like they been used. Dice are yellow even they are said to be ''new''. i had open the chips and feel there weight and they don't feel like 11.5 feel like they put a metal in between and let it be. Terrible...cards cheap plastic card. I will never by product from them again. Description is different then what i receive that all i got to say i got the picture to show it. false advertisement given out cheap piece of crap...look GROSSS
3,Review 123,1. chips were damaged during shipping.2. card decks were damaged too3. case quality is Normal....
5,Quality product,This is a high quality product that we love to use. It arrived on time and as expected. No problems whatsoever.
4,How many reviews have you read?,I've looked at just about every poker chip set out there in regards to getting a cheap workable set that doesn't look like crap. If that is what you want these are them. The case is of little value but will hold your chips. The chips are a perfect weight and I found no printing issues. Throw the cards out and get Copaq ones.
3,All In!,Chips are great quality. Dice and buttons are nice too. Quality of case has a little to be desired. Worth a buy for playing poker with friends.
1,No quality control and minimal support!,"I ordered a set for a gift. While the chips were fine, the inside of the case was awful. The insert that holds the chips is flimsy and is too small for the case. The insert was cracked in several places, and glued support strips inside the case were exposed and sticky. Amazon was easy about the return. I spoke with a rep and ordered a replacement set on the condition that the set be examined before shipping. I was reassured this would happen. The replacement set arrived and was so bad that the first set looked good by comparison! Again, Amazon was easy about the return but never once offered any suggestion as to what I might buy instead, and offered no 'free shipping' as I had had on my original orders. I think there should be better quality control and I think Amazon should make an effort to ""make-good"" when a good order goes bad."
2,Poor Quality,The quality of the case is poor. It does not close well. And there seems to be poor structural integrity of the case. Some of the chips are dirty or damaged somehow?
2,disapointed,This was one of my favorite shows of all time. But this DVD was a huge let down. First it is only four episodes. And it is the fist four that were not the best shows. The program got funnier and far better as time went along. Grandpa doesn't evan have his trade mark limp in these episodes.
1,These Shows Have All Been Edited,"All shows on this set are the edited versions. Each show is missing more than 3 minutes of footage. The other set from this company is the same. If you want the original un-cut versions then skip these. If you don't mind having missing footage, then go for it. Personally, I would rather"" NOT "" have something than have shows the way these are."
2,"I was disappointed, too. Very.",I am new to growing wheatgrass & am very glad this was not the brand I tried first. I had been using some from healthy-eating and was quite happy with it (the only other brand I've tried so far) but decided to try this one because it is about half the price. Wish I had only bought 10 lbs. instead of 25. The grass here is very slow to grow and sparse and patchy.
3,"Good for newbies, don't go if you're a pro.","I got this book when starting to get somewhat serious about Flash animation hoping it would teach me to do some serious animation. I was somewhat dissapointed that it didn't teach me anything I didn't already know from another book or from tutorial reading on the internet.The book is good if you're starting out in Flash, infact, it's very good for that. It walks you through tweening, frame-by-frame animation, and the works. However, just by playing around and using common sense, I already knew all this.The examples this author uses are very...creative and unique. That's not a bad thing, except you can't really apply them to everday animation.All in all, this book is a good book if you're starting out. It will get you through the basics and a little more. If you're an intermediate or pro user, don't spend the money for it. I think the only way to get to know what you want to know is message boards or just practicing..."
4,Learn by deconstruction,(contributor) Working with flash native files that were created by professional animators and reading how they were done is a great way to learn tips and tricks. The books layout and design is the best I've seen on the market.
3,Purcell is not an artist,"The only worthwhile part of this book, is when Purcell intrerviews people who Flash for as a job, and questions them on techniques, tips, and tricks. These pages are very helpful (especially sound). You can tell Purcell himself is no an artist. If you check out the tutorials he wrote, they're just so stupid, and not useful (fighting skunks, a walking ostrich, etc.). However, the CD is great, and hearing pros talk about Flash is something new, it's a worth a buy, but don't bother with the tutorials, they're a waste of time."
4,A Good Way to Remember or to Experience for the First Time,"I really enjoyed this book. It adds even more personal insight to the already personal stories of Brokaw's first book. I myself, enjoyed the tales of struggle on the home from and on bonds formed to be slightly more interesting then tales of battle, but I guess that is open to interpretation. The best way to read this book is while listening to music of the time and putting yourself in the shoes of those involved."
2,Over-rated,"The book is boring. Perhaps Brokaw is trying to pat himself and others of his age on the back. As young men they fought in WWII- they did not lead it. Their track record as leaders is debatable. As President's go, it seems unlikely that Kennedy, JOhnson, Nixon, Carter, Ford or Bush (HW) will ever be highly rated. Reagan was outstanding so give them a point.Internationally the did not solve the issues of the Mid-East or Northern Ireland. Science marched on but the pace did not change.Even if you except his conclusion, the book is not compelling. TV journalists do well in 60 second, heavily edited snippets. This book did not engage for much more than that.I am glad I borrowed it."
5,The Greatest Generation Speaks,"How wonderful it is, as a result of Brokaw's first book, that so many communication barriers have broken down and that so many people have shared their previously untold stories with us. I was moved beyond words by so many of these first-hand accounts. As a 47 year-old daughter of a WWII veteran who has never spoken of his wartime experiences, Brokaw's books have provided me with a deeper respect for and understanding of my dad. This past November I viewed Veterans Day in a way I had never done before. Thank you, Tom Brokaw, for contributing so significantly to our appreciation of this generation."
5,Honored Memory,"In 1987, my mother, brother, and I walked through the American Military Cemetary in Luxumburg - where thousands of men are buried from the Battle of the Bulge. It is a peaceful, dignified place. We met a women who had finally found the grave of her brother who had died in the battle more than 40 years before. I cried for these men who gave the supreme sacrifice nine years before I was born. Thank you for your sacrifice. Thank you, Mr. Brokow, for a well written book that gives honor where honor is due."
3,deceptive advertizing,"I had to purchase this book twice (did not want to) both books were listed in the Kindle store as ""The Greatest Generation""but one of them was in fact, ""The Greatest Generation Speaks: Letters and Reflections"". Just one more Kindle problem."
5,Both heartrending and uplifting,"After the publication of the bestsellingThe Greatest Generation, Tom Brokaw received mail from readers across the country. The letters provide accounts of WWII soldiers who reconnected after fifty years because of a name mentioned in Brokaw's book. Children and grandchildren wrote of the deceased soldiers they never knew - and how important the book was in understanding their ancestors. Others wrote of similar tales mentioned in The Greatest Generation, or pointed out areas of the war that Brokaw overlooked. At times heartrending and uplifting, Brokaw's follow up to The Greatest Generation is truly inspiring.The audiobook is a great way to ""read"" this book. Brokaw reads the introductions to the chapters, while a supporting cast reads the letters and accounts featured. The various voices allow the listener to move between stories with ease."
3,Not what I was looking for...,"It is hard to write a negative review of such an honorable subject as this, but the book did not hit home with me. I already treasure what the greatest generation did for this country and for the world, so there was very little that could stir my emotions. The letters were either edited for brevity or they happened to be so short that I could get emotionally involved. Maybe I was asking for too much, but Tom left me longing to get to know the characters, and in each case he jumped me to the next one.All in all, not a bad book, but one that is best read when you might be easily distracted."
4,Better Than the First Book,"RE: AUDIO VERSION READ BY BROKAW. I listened to this tape set prior to reading Brokaw's forerunner ""Greatest Generation"", and found it profoundly inspiring, and as the son of a Pearl Harbor vet dad and Wash DC clerical mom married since 1947, it rings absolutely true. Very important stuff historically, socially and emotionally. Interestingly, I find that these stories submitted directly by the readers in response to the first book are far more riveting than the interviews Brokaw solicited for the first work. If you have time or interest to read only one make it this one rather than ""The Greatest Generation"". The author's reading is surprisingly mush-mouthed for a celebrated news anchor - I'm afraid he's past his broadcasting prime. 5 stars for the material but take one away for this recorded version."
2,Pretty Crummy Album,"This isn't very good and I'm bummed that I shelled out the extra money to buy an import copy of it. I was really taken with their previous album, XTRMNTR, and the one before that, Vanishing Point, but as others have said, this album just seems to be treading water. It doesn't move their sound forward or challenge the listener. It does NOT sound like XTRMNTR, so save your money if that's what you're looking for. With all the talent and famous collaborators who put time in on this, I was sure expecting something more. If you must have this album, save your money and buy a used copy."
2,"Listen to Once, then Shelve","The Chemical Brothers, Death in Vegas, David Holmes. All had albums featuring Bobby G on guest vocals. All those cameos sound like Evil Heat.Electro music as a genre has roughly 10 'noises'. You know, football clacker clicking noises, tinny metronomic percussion, hissy highhats. All have been embraced by the 'Scream, and boy do they sound dull.Weatherall may well have been a super producer, but listen to his '9 o'clock drop' compilation to see where Evil Heat's sound originates from. Or indeed, the Sabres remix of 'Stuka'.Buy if you liked 'Bow Down to the Exit Sign' by Holmes."
3,Not For Beginners,"Very impressive performances, but not for beginners. Also, to the sellers asking 168 bucks for this: honestly, are you nuts?"
5,"Extremely interesting book, combines history and information","Sisters: Catholic Nuns and the Making of America is anoverview of the influence and contributions of nuns in thevast American land. There are a few statistics, someinterviews, and a great deal of history. History can bea very slow read. It can be to dense to wade through.But Fialka does a great job of presenting history in away that is not only interesting, but also enjoyable toread. The only sad part, of course, comes in the latterpart of the book when he writes of the decline of somany of the sisterhoods. Some of the decline was fast andintense, some has been slower - but all of it seems tobe painful. There are a few glimmers of hope, though.Some of the work done by the Dominican Sisters of Nashvilleand the Oblate Sisters of Providence is wonderful."
1,Replacement Lithium-ion Battery for Kyocera Slider Remix/Sonic KX5,"This battery does not hold a charge to last the whole day. It will last about 1.5 hrs or less of talk where as my oem battery lasted 2 days and held a 3 hrs or more talk time. I keep on having to charge it when I can. I didn't pay much, so I guess I got what I pay for."
4,Fun and Whimsical,"I just got pick up this book from an used bood store and glad I did. It's a cute fun little book and since I've never read any of Tolkien stuff I had no problem enjoying the story, though how anybody can compare a loooooooong novel with a short book is beyond me.The pig was cute and funny and the hyper-clean eel was amusing. It kind of makes me want to have an eel for a watch-animal and companion too. The anti-guest witch was also funny to read even though she had a short role.Overall it's a nice book for an afternoon read where all the characters come out swimmingly in the end, even the bad guys, who weren't all that bad."
3,Fond memory of this book,"My mother read this book to me when I was a little girl and I do remember being riveted by the little pig who seemed to be a whole lot like me - though in reality, the little pig was alot like most children, which was the point. My mom picked this book because she thought that we kids (there were 5 of us) would like the fact that there was a character we could identify with and that was ""adult"" enough so she would also stay interested. You have to remember that the genre of modern children's fantasy did not really develop until the Harry Potter series took off. This was a sweet little pre cursor to that genre and a fond memory for me."
3,"Not good, but not the worst that I have seen.","I liked this movie to a point. The parodies were hit or miss. Some really well. Others didn't fair well, but thankfully they were the short ones. Problem is they rushed from one parody to the next creating alot of confusion.Story could have been put together a bit better. I thought that Not Another Teen Movie was better in that aspect. But again Parody flicks aren't necessarily built on the storylines. They are built around knowing the originals and what is spoofed."
2,Jennifer Coolidge shines in a lackluster film,The film itself is what you would call a POS. Too many parodies that lose sight of the actual story and rely far too much on gross out humor. Only this film is more gross in its obnoxiousness than sight gags. However the one shining point that saves this film is Jennifer Coolidge as the Streisand send-up Jewish mother. The woman could be hilarious as a funeral.
1,Worst Movie of All Time,I wish I could have given this movie less than one star. It sucked. I only could stomach 20 minuits of the movie before I walked out of the movie theatre.I had wanted to see it because of Allyson Hannigan because I liked her from How I Met Your Mother. However the characters were just weird and the parady from Meet the Parents with the cat using the bathroom bordered on just plane discusting.
1,"Worst film I have ever seen, What was Alyson Hannigan thinking???","This has got to be the worst film I have ever seen, and I have seen some pretty bad ones. Parody's like ""Scary movie"" and ""Not another teen movie"" look like Oscar winning Shakespeare films next to this disaster. Ever since I first saw her on BTVS I have always been a big Alyson Hannigan fan, it is rare to see an actress that can handle both sensitive dramatic scenes AND have a great sense of comic timing, neither of which are evident here, I really would like to see her mix in a few more dramatic roles like she did in ""Beyond the city limits"" (A Very underrated film!!!) but one more horrible disaster like this and the great career boost she got from doing BTVS and the American Pie films will have gone right down the tubes. What was her agent thinking even showing her this project??? Will some director PLEASE save Alyson Hannigan and offer her a great dramatic role to save her career!"
2,A rental!,"A good laugh, but only if you have seen a lot of ""date movies"" - which is the only true way to see the humor in this movie. I was surprised that they dug back as far as they did - I expected it would be just current ""date"" movies. Went back to Pretty Woman and even Say Anything! Definitely a rental - wait for the dvd!"
2,Don't be fooled by the preview,"I saw the preview for this movie and thought it'd bepretty funny. The Napolean Dynamite scene is one of thehighlights,and that occurs in the first scene. Unfortunately,it's all downhill from there. A big chunk of the movie isparodies of Meet the Parents and Meet the Fockers. Tryingto parody a classic comedy is like going to karaoke night andtrying to sing a Celine Dion song. At best, it's tolerable.Worst case scenerio, well.... you get the idea. Nowhere nearas funny as the Scary Movie movies."
1,Total waste of time. . .,"I've alread wasted an hour and a half of my life watching this movie. And beleive me that's time I'd like to have back. It pains me to have to spend anymore time dwelling on this drivel.There are two major problems with this film. First and foremost it's not funny. Maybe I missed an e-mail or a memo or something but I thought comedies were supposed to be funny. And secondly why is this movie "" unrated "". I saw nothing in here that wouldn't have been above a PG-13. My only guess is that without "" unrated "" plastered on the cover it wouldn't have appealed to such a wide audience.The four writers who had nothing to do with this movie have to be some of the smartest people in the world. So if you're eyeing this movie in the rental store, my only advice to you is to slowly back away and move on to the next movie on your list. Do that and you'll be lucky enough to be considered in the same breath as those four writers...some of the smartest people in the world."
2,"I really wanted to like this, but it just isn't happening","Let me first say I love Alyson Hannigan. I really wanted to like this movie given this is her first major movie role.But alas, this movie is crap. With the exception of a few chuckles here and there, this is something to watch while you're websurfing or talking on the phone - giving it your full attention is not only unnecessary but almost painful. The jokes are bad, predictable, and worst of all, not funny.If you have any interest in this movie I strongly recommend you RENT IT first before you spend money on it.I can only hope that Alyson's next movie is of higher caliber. :("
1,i want my $20 back.,this is perhaps the worst movie i have ever seen. it was a total waste of money and i want to light the disk on fire just so i can get some enjoyment out of it.
5,Boys,My son is really into these types of moves. Always good for a laugh. Not sure he understands everything but that is probably a good thing.
1,worst. movie. ever.,"I normally don't write movie reviews because movies are very subjective but in this case, I'll make an exception. I had the misfortune of watching this movie, as I'm a fan of ""dumb comedies"" but this one fails. On every level. Do not waste your time with this one...TRUST ME ON THIS. It is so bad; I don't even know where to begin.Skip it."
1,Unrated?,"I'm tired of all these movies claiming to be the Unrated Version and not offering a single thing that wouldn't be included without exception in a PG-13 movie. Add to that only seven or eight decent laughs in the whole movie and I'm pretty ticked-off. Explaining the spoofs would actually be funnier than the movie, so I won't do it.Tried and true spoof formula is not properly hashed out in cheap attempt to cash-in on quarter-of-a-century craze(Airplane 1980). Top Secret, Hot Shot, Hot Shot Part Deux and Not Another Teen Movie are much examples of this (art) form.Might have given it two stars if they left the Unrated off the box.A lot more of Josh Meyers might have helped."
1,Zero Stars if I could. It shouldn't even exist...,"This movie is by far the worst movie ever!!! I'm so pissed that I even watched it. The fact that I sat through this piece of [...] is my ONLY regret in life. Seriously...It's not funny. It's not... damn, it's not anything...I wanted to walk out of the theater so bad, but unfortunately, I'm cheap... so unfortunately I stayed.You're gonna watch it anyway, but don't say I didn't warn you!!!"
1,not even worth a star,"the sad thing about me giving this movie a horrible rating is that i love comedies and didn't even expect it to be watchable. it seems like every year there is a new trend or two for movies. the past five or six years, i would bet that at least 1/3 of the theatrical releases have been either sequels, remakes, or spoofs of other movies. the reason ""scary movie"" works (assuming it works because a third sequel is in the making) is because it lampoons supposed scary movies for comedic effect. you know its a bad sign when the movies that DATE MOVIE makes fun of are funnier than the movie itself. also, to all the directors out there: comedy cannot be shoved down the audiences' throat, it has to evolve naturally from the situation."
3,What are your problems.....,I thought this movie was funny as hell by the end my sides were hurting from all the laughing I did. True there were some scenes to stupid to be in a film but all in all this was a good movie. I've seen or know people that have seen the movies this film paradided and I got to see say if all romatic films were like this I'd have a bigger collection of films than just comdeys and horror flicks.
2,"An unfunny, unoriginal spoof of romantic comedies","Date Movie has some funny moments. But they are the kind of funny moments where you are almost embarrassed to find yourself laughing at these completely retarded, senseless jokes that should only be funny to those around the age of 10. The reason that Date Movie really doesn't work is the fact that a lot of the movies that it spoofs are already comedies. Therefore, all the funny moments are basically just retreads of the funny parts of actual good comedies released over the past few years. If you wanna know the basic trend of the jokes in Date Movie, go rent your favorite romantic comedy, and imagine all the jokes in that movie if they were blatantly sexualized or made so unimaginably disgusting that even I could barely handle what I was watching. There is no redeeming quality or character to Date Movie. The movie has about 4 or 5 funny moments, and will be completely offensive to most of the people who decide to throw down 7 bucks to see it."
3,The first half hour was good but than it was terrible,"The first half hour of this movie was funny and looked like this was going to be a good movie. Right After the wedding planner scene, is where this movie got bad. It didnt get bad slowly though, it got bad quickly. The first 30 min were put together poorly but were at least funny but the rest of the movie is like the director smoked a bag of weed when they made it. If they make a sequel i hope the whole thing is good and it has a btter story"
3,It's a SATIRE,"I found this movie funny. No, it's not Oscar material. It's not meant to be. It's meant to make you LAUGH. And everybody in the audience was. I will say I thought the cat on the toilet scene was gross. But the rest was pretty funny even though apparently some people are upset that they couldn't figure out what movie they were lampooning. The funniest scenes were the male lead playing a ""Pretty Woman"" prostitute (he didn't look bad) and when Julia commandeers a motorcycle to get back to her fiance - the stunt person riding the bike is obviously a black man in a pink dress. What was that about? Oh well, it was funny. Throughout the movie, Julia maintains her optimism in life, interspersed with a little low self-esteem.Don't give up, Prince Charming is out there - you just have to overlook a lot once you find him."
1,One of the All-Time Worst Movies Ever Made,"This movie is so horribly bad that I recommend mature adults rent it just to see how bad it is. My wife and I walked out on this movie after 20 excruciating minutes of stupid, senseless, parodies. At least there was a loose plot to Another Teen Movie and the first three Scary Movies, but not this one. Most of the kids in attendance were teens and preteens, which was not good because of the terribly insensitive scenes like the dating couple beating the heck out of a street bum, or the male date inexplicably faking a female orgasm for no particular reason other than to make you think they might be making fun of When Harry Met Sally.Only trouble is that these gags hit zero on the humor meter. Do not waste your money on this trash other than renting it for sheer morbid curiosity."
3,Date Movie,">Very funny! Made in awfully poor taste, just what I like. It absolutely spoofs other movies and television shows to death, leaving one to wonder where can it all end; what with so much ridiculous imitating of other productions going on, it barely has time to follow it's own storyline or plot. Some scenes are just plain gross, in the direct-in your face style that shocks and violates all of your six senses-which more often than not-repels, rather than sets one's affections for the eventual wedding couple;(let alone any other members of the cast)...However, it is hilarious and over the top, with nonstop ludicrous scene after scene-complete with a happy ending for the two young lovers that none of us would really want to know or meet up with anywhere. If I did I would RUN!-Kevin Griffin..."
1,Wow An Average Rating Of Two Stars.......That Tells You Something!,I have to agree with the masses. This movie is a total bore. The repetitive spoofs back to back to back are oh so annoying. My attention drifted away from this garbage and I startd surfing the net.Not only were the jokes bad but they were gross and unpleasant and demeaning. Even Allsion Harrigan as a thin person was not too pleasing to view on the screen. And the scene where the couple roll a drunk like its the thing to do is so mean spirited.Avoid at all costs. The people have properly spoken.
1,Astoundingly bad,"Perhaps the worst mainstream, major studio release in the history of American movies. If it was 100 times better it might reach the ""so-bad-it's-funny"" level, but it is far worse than that. Too bad- Alyson Hannigan is hot and the reason I watched this. If she had performed the entire movie nude it still wouldn't be worth watching."
1,STOP! BACK AWAY FROM THIS MOVIE...(its for your own good),"Date Movie? More like a horrible blind-date movie. Instead of buying this movie, go buy all of the movies that this one spoofed. Because this movie is just incredibly dumb...(I was trying to think of a better word for it, but there is none) TRUST ME, if you are a fan of movies at all...don't watch this one, because it will turn you off of others for a while."
2,Pretty bad date movie,"I saw this movie in a movie theater with my boyfriend, and by the middle of it, we left. I've never seen anything so stupid and not funny in the same movie. The humor is pretty bad, and might even be offensive for some people. Don't they have anything better to do than make fun of other movies that are at least worth to watch?"
1,WORST MOVIE EVER!!!!,I never thought in my life i would see a movie so bad. It was pointless. I love all the scary movies but now i know that whenever i see a bad part in a scary movie the 2/6 writers probaly made it up!
1,Not deserving of two stars,"I'm going to keep this review short and sweet. I bought this DVD from Wal-Mart's bargain bin and I feel cheated out of $5. I tried to watch it twice, the second time skipping through the especially stupid and unfunny parts, and still could not bring myself to finish it. I've seen just about every parody movie Hollywood has come out with and this one is at the bottom. To quote a great comedy, Date Movie is ""dreadful, embarrassing, terrible, horrifyingly bad, bad, bad..."""
4,Hillarious,"You guys really need to get a sense of humor here. Yes, it is childish, yes it is adolescent and yes it is very stupid but there are parts that are damn funny. I really liked this movie and you have to watch it like you are viewing the absurd which you are. This movie is for people that like parodies of other movies taking it to the extreme. I recommend this movie to anyone that has a sense of humor for the absurd. So, put a smile on, sit back and laugh. It won't crack your face."
2,not really even funny,"First of all a sucky plot, second of all the movie contains very little funny moments...overall it sucked...not woth buying just rent it or borrow it from a friend...thats all"
3,Mediocre Movie,"Wow, what a let down. This movie had such great potential and it fell flat on its face. ""Date Movie"" isn't god-awful, but it isn't a movie you're likely going to want to watch over and over again.Alyson Hannigan is wonderful and I've never seen her look better, well after the first 10 minutes anyway. Eddie Griffin who can be very funny, just wasn't in this time around.There are a few funny parts of the movie and some good scenes, but overall it just doesn't deliever and I can't recommend it for anyone looking to add it to their collection. ""Not Another Teen Movie"" was much better I thought."
1,RENT BEFORE YOU BUY,"I WAS DUMB,,I WENT OUT AND GOT THIS MOVIE BEFORE SEEING IT AND I REALLY WANT MY $12.00 BACK.. STUPID MOVIE,,,SAME DAMN JOKES AGAIN,,IN CLOSING DONT RENT IT DONT BUY IT!"
3,Date Movie,"""Date Movie"" is from two of the six writers of ""Scary Movie"", and is a spoof of romantic comedies. Apparently, they chose two of the worst writers from ""Scary Movie"", because the movie falls flat more often than it works. Alyson Hannigan is Julia Jones, the fat girl looking for Mr. Right. Hannigan deserves a better role -- she can be funny, but the material she has to work with is less than stellar. She does what she can, but it is not enough to make ""Date Movie"" work. The supporting cast of Adam Campbell (the boyfriend), Eddie Griffin (the dad), and Jennifer Coolidge and Fred Willard (the boyfriend's parents do not add much to the film either. ""Date Movie"" does manage to be pretty gross at times for a PG-13 movie, but that is not really a selling point either. This will be enjoyed by some, but only mildly. It is not awful, but it is far from great. Wait for the DVD if you must see it."
2,Heed The Warnings,"One of the reasons I like buying on Amazon is because of these reviews. Usually I can get a feeling about a movie by the reviews it receives....Unfortunately I bought this on sale as a ""Previously Viewed"" before I ever checked out the reviews. The fact that they list on the cover that 2 of the writers worked on Scary Movie naturally made me think this had to be good because all of the Scary Movies have been roll on the floor funny. This movies does have some funny parts to it, but not enough to really want spend much money or time on it.The JayLo bit has been over done for some time before the movie came out so the giagantic rear end bit just comes across as silly nonsense....As with much of the movie...."
1,always laugh at these parody movies...but not this one...,"The movie was funny the first, oh lets say about maybe the first 20-40 minutes. After that the movie is garbage. The humor and mocking was so dis-tasteful and a little offensive. The cat in the bathroom, ""dead mrs.jones"", the little jokes by the bachellor's parents, the bizarre family relationships, and the mock-sexual references to sex.I was very surprised at myself when i viewed the film. I hardly laughed and didnt laugh when I needed. Like I said I totally love these not another teen movie, scary movie type films...but Date Movie is pure garage. The humor is so awful and the mockery sucks tooBottom line: Horrible movie...never watching it again."
2,Theater vs DVD,"I saw this movie at the theaters and it was awsome, funny as can be, so when it came out on DVD i bought it. Not quite so funny this time. I don't think it was so much that I had seen it before as much as it was that with out a crowd laughing alongside of you it's just not as humourous. It relys hevily on gross out humor and parody of some movies that weren't that great to begin with."
2,Not what I expected,"Sadly, this book spends more time being funny than it does offering sound advice and instructions for actual home maintenance. If I had bought it for entertainment purposes, it would have been great, but I got it to help me care for my home...something it doesn't do."
5,miles of memories,This albumn is another collection of great songs from Dierks! It flows well from beginning to end. I can really feel the heart and soul he put into each song.
2,Generic,"After hearing every mile a memory and kinda liking it and reading the reviews here at CDNOW I am very disappointed that I bought this cd. Dierks is just another generic country boy. I was hoping for something different from him, but alas, not. After one listen, not one song sticks to me except his hit, and that isn't very good. Don't believe I'll be buying anymore of this stuff."
4,Maybe its radios fault...,"I thought this album was good but far from great. I am not sure if its because I am so sick of hearing Long Trip Alone that I could rip what little hair I have out or because the album was too mellow but this album is on the ""nice to have"" list not the ""need to have.""I do enjoy Free and Easy & Band of Brothers but I didn't find anything profound about this album. It wasn't bad, just not special."
4,"An impressive, solid effort from Dierks!!!!","Man, I was impressed with this album all the way through. I am sure it has its flaws, but they are few and far between. I like how this kid is doing too, respectful to the past and progressive enough for the alternative crowd. ""Every Mile A Memory"" is a great single and ""Long Trip Alone"" is a very good song. Buy this album, Dierks got his stuff together and he should only get better as time goes by. Thanks Dierks!"
5,"Soulful. Easily, great country music.","Dierks Bentley's ""Long Trip Alone"" is a wonderful listen.The songs take me back to roadtrips and good times.I love the effortless mix of modern country and old time bluegrass.Bentley's voice is rustic, but enjoyable.Worth every penny."
4,Above Standard Playing By Jarrett Trio On This Live LP,"Like the title says...a half-dozen jazz/pop chestnuts done live, before an appreciative Paris crowd, by virtuoso pianist Jarrett and bandmates Jack Dejohnnette and Gary Peacock.Things get a little too cute at times; the audible groans and grunts, even through the prettiest songs, sound more like indigestion than intensity. Moreover, ""The Way You Look Tonight"" here lacks the jauntiness of Errol Garner's version. But Jarrett's consistent dives from introspective, near-classical playing deep into be-bop groove, plus tight ensemble playing (Peacock and Jarrett toe-to-toe on an airy ""Falling In Love With Love,"" a fine version of Nat Adderly's ""The Old Country,"" DiJohnnette's popping drum solos throughout) wins the day. A fine album for those just beginning to enjoy Jarrett or jazz piano in general."
2,"umm, try something else","keith plays like a pig here- he practically wastes peacock and dejohnette, they are allowed nothing else than the opportunity to accompany jarrett's yowling and over-indulgent right-hand lines. for some serious piano trio playing, check out mccoy tyner's early albums for impulse, bill evans' live at montreux, chick corea's now he sings, now he sobs, anything by paul bley with gary peacock, or keith's own first albums with charlie haden and paul motian"
1,What's with all the yowling?,Amazing jazz but would be much better without all the yowling (is he okay?). Because yowling seems to be part of the Keith Jarrett jazz experience this was my first and last Keith Jarrett purchase. Check out something by Bill Evans. Make the yowling stop! Please!
5,Great Read!,"Simply put, this book is excellent entertainment. It is definitely one of our familiy's favorites and one that I can see myself reading again."
5,Absolutely wonderful!,"""The Alliance"" is defiantely one of the best books I've read (And I read ALOT of books. Can't help it). Having first read ""The Work and the Glory"" and ""The Kingdom and the Crown"" series by the same author, I was a bit surprised when I found that the book took place in the future, but it was absolutely wonderful. The moral issues explored were very interesting, and the plot was fast paced and exciting. You should definately give this book a try! (P.S. I love Eric Lloyd[the main character]! He's awesome!)"
5,Love this book!,This has been a favorite of mine for years. It is a great story about liberty and the consequences of trying to take away liberties to make society better. Highly recommended.
3,2 great remixes of main vein,"When it comes to later releases of Jamiroquai singles, I am usually a bit critical of the poor-just plain bad remixes of the songs on them, this one however is a bit of an exception.The 2 Main Vein remixes are very different, the Knee Deep Classic Mix is a very funky house feel to it whereas the Deep Swings Jazzy Thumper Mix has a very upbeat ibiza feel to it with the horns.Overall not a bad little single, apart from the radio edit of Corner of the Earth."
2,Toxic to Cats - Be Cautious,"Tea tree oil is toxic to cats in all but the very smallest doses. A cat's liver is not capable of processing it. For an average cat weighing seven to 12 pounds, somewhere between 1 1/2 to 3 teaspoons of tea tree oil would be lethal. Because of this cats should never be treated with anything more than one to five drops of tea tree oil per teaspoon of carrier oil. The same thing applies to small, and some medium-sized dogs.Another reason to avoid using tea tree oil on small animals is that they tend to lick themselves and end up ingesting the oil.Most of the cat deaths from tea tree oil come from people using tea tree flea & tick treatments which are applied to the entire body of the cat. This product is applied only in the ear. Nonetheless, given the extreme toxicity of tea tree oil to cats, I would be very cautious. Is the ear wash so essential that it is worth risking your cat's life? Perhaps try another product first."
2,Not worth it,"Was using Oti-clens from the vet and looked for something bigger and cheaper. This is not for dogs who have chronic ear mites or ear moisture. My dogs ears got worse and now we are off to the vet for the good stuff. Don't try to save money, get the real deal."
2,average product,This cd is nice yes. but it wasn't what I thought it was going to be. I wouldn't recomend this item.
4,Great maker - dirty though,"I bought this as a gift and the recipient lives it! Only problem is it came in a non-original box, with no manual, and not exactly clean."
5,Only Thing That Works For Me,"I had dry eye problems that caused filamentary keratitis (little tunnels from the surface of my eye inwards), after having them removed (painfully) several times I went to a different doctor that suggested I try Theratears Omega-3. They are a bit pricey (check your local Walgreens and keep the coupon for a $1 off that comes inside the box) but they are the only thing that have worked for me.I tried switching a few times to other brands that costs less and I immediately noticed a difference. The Omega-3's also seem to help with mood and joint pain. If you have stomach problems taking them at first just start with one pill at night and after a week go to two, and after another week 3. You can also split up the doses though I don't recommend 3 a day at first unless you are already on Omega-3s.I felt such a difference after a few weeks of taking these that I found a reputable supplier of childrens chewable Omega-3s for my son!"
1,Waste of money - Omega 3 oil... Snake oil,"After taking Thera Tears Omega-3 supplements for 3 months straight along with the Thera Tears eye drops, there has been absolutely no change in my eye dryness or redness. I purchased after reading overwhelmingly positive reviews on multiple sites, but considering that this is nothing more than 1.2g of fat and after noticing no effect myself, I believe this product is just another snake oil/placebo. Don't waste your money.As far as an omega-3 supplement, you can get about the same amount of omega-3 in Now's supplement for half the price and twice the quantity."
2,The smallest burp with = fish taste,"Well, I'm on my second day and I don't think I can tolerate the fish taste, so will have to just get regular flax oil to help with my lasik induced dry eyes."
3,NOT TO EFFECTIVE W/ MY EYE DRYNESS,DID NOT SEE A WHOLE LOT OF IMPROVEMENT. I KNOW EVERYBODY HAVEA DIFFERENT CHEMISTRY AND EVEN GOOD PRODUCTS WILL NOT BE EFFECTIVEIN EVERY PERSON.
5,Best product for eye health.,"I had severe dry eye and found this to be the best product to help restore my eyes to health. I did have to have punctal plugs inserted, but I feel that I would not have been able to go back to wearing contacts without these supplements. I tried other fish oil products, but they did not work nearly as well, leaving my eyes more irritable and itchy. Good for blepharitis as well!"
3,Fishy burps,"I have only been using this product a little over a week, so cannot speak to efficacy for my dry eyes. However, it has given me fishy burps. I have not observed any other negative effects. I plan to keep taking for at least a couple of months to see if there are any eye effects."
4,Thera Tears Nutrition helps my dry-eye problem,I have a problem with dry eyes bad enough to change my ability to read an eye chart significantly. Taking these supplements seems to keep them more moistened and the ingredients are oils I've been encouraged to take anyway.
5,Greatest product for dry eyes!,"I have suffered from dry eyes for the past two years and i have tried numerous products. I have tried supplements, eye drops, compresses,etc. The thera tears have been highly recommended by my eye doctor. My meibomian glands are not releasing the oily film effectively so it leaves my aqueous tears unprotected and so my eye dries up faster.Ever since I started taking thera tears I was able to feel and see a difference within 5-7 days. I don't wake up with my eyes dry shut anymore and my eyes aren't blurry anymore.Pros:1.Can tell a difference and my eyes aren't as dry as they were before2.It contains fish oil which is also great for your heart and vasculature3. Price is great and cheaper than store prices4.They don't SMELL like fish pills5.It's dosed once a day versus other products that are 2-3 times a dayCons: only 11.They tend to cause you to belch some fishy smell.I highly recommend this product!!"
1,Gave me a headache,"I purchased TheraTears for my eye discomfort from contact lense wear. I was taking 3 pills in the morning, just as directed on the label. I noticed I was getting migraines from taking the pills after the second day or so. I began to get headaches every day. After about the 5th or 6th day, I thought it could be from the TheraTears. I stopped taking them and the next day or two my headaches were gone. I have since discontinued use altogether. Unfortunately, due to the side effects, I wasn't able to use the product very long to assess if it helped with my dry eye. During the short period of time I did use it, I did not see a difference. By the way, this product is not FDA approved."
1,this is a waste of time!!!,"the movies on this disc might be good,but from the very poor transfers here(droped audio,picture drop-out and freese pictures ,and all the movies were very very dark almost not watchable)you would never know. skip this mess and look for these movies elsewere!!!"
5,EXCELLENT BOOK!!!!,"I was given this book as a gift from a friend who said, ""Now you'll understand what's going on with your life, Diane. You're a mustang. That's not a negative."" When I read Fawn Germer's Mustang Sallies, I knew what she meant. I've always felt misunderstood and underappreciated. Now I realize I am what Germer calls a ""trailblazer."" I've never been one to go along to get along, and I don't kiss up to move up. That's hurt me in the past, but Mustang Sallies is filled with strategies to make me succeed without selling out. I love this book. (...) It's phenomenal."
5,oh yes Ladies be a mustang sallie but read this first!,"This book has all kinds of insights on what we as women do in the workforce to make it work and our own ways we subvert our own success. Read this women, you are in this book."
3,I would like to know...,"I would like to know how to get the European version of this film on a DVD that will playin the United States, rather than the ""Bible Belt"" version. The most obvious omission inthe ""Bible Belt"" version is the woman in an office in Greenwich Village interviewing a gayman. The version we saw in college, which we were TOLD was the European version had areally beautiful woman wearing nothing but red, white and blue body paint. The Bible Beltversion has a different woman wearing shorts and a top with a small tattoo or painted areaon her back. The body paint scene was the most beautiful moment in the film, but is omittedfrom the ""Bible Belt"" version, which I accidentally purchased from my satellite provider.So, how do you get the good version?"
4,Milano Fashion 2,I loved this CD though not overly fussed on the After party Disc 2 but otherwise it's great music to chill out with.
4,Secrets of a Freelance writer,"This book gives a very detailed plan of action to get a writer started incopywriting. I have purchased many books by Bob Bly, and this is one of his best."
4,Dated but great,"Some of the details in this book are dated, but the core strategy is solid. Bly lays out how to find work as a freelance business writer, handle clients, and get paid. The writing style is straight-forward, and the book is very light on B.S. and filler -- all of which make it an enjoyable read."
5,Provides great advise,"Had this book a longtime on my wishlist. Finaly got it.I like the way it's written. It's very clear, and well structured. Full of advises and tips. I especially liked chapters 5 and 6, on ""Setting your fees"" and ""Finding your Markets"". But the appendices are really amazing! List of fees (!), Sample contracts (!), Sample promos, model documents,.... you can just use!!!! I mean if you ever wanted to make a jump-start with writing,... this will certainly help."
4,Gotta have it.,"SECRETS OF A FREELANCE WRITER by Bob Bly is a bit of rehash. Yes, I know, this is a thrid edition and is supposed to be an updated rehash, but there is also a lot of content here from some of Bly's other books, such as The Copywriter's Handbook. The thing is, there is also enough new and valuable content here to make this another ""must read"" for copywriters.This book also very closely mirrors Peter Bowerman's Well-Fed Writer with much of the same content. That's not necessarily a bad thing and just adds confirmation to the advice being given.I wont begin to talk about what you might take away from this book. Different people are going to take away different ideas. But suffice it to say, you WILL learn a lot here. Even though this plate has leftover vegetables, the meat is hot off the grill."
4,Tremendous Valuable Information,"In Secrets of a Freelance Writer, Third Edition, Bob Bly does a tremendous job sharing information about starting out as a freelance writer. I liked that he has updated the information so it's valid and applicable to the 2000s (first decade). Although it's an advanced read - long chapters and sections - it's filled with tremendous amounts of information. I feel I got my money's worth and will gladly take on the challenge of other Bly books, knowing I'll have bundles of reference information in my collection."
5,You Should Read This!,"Considering a freelance career in copywriting? Then you should read this. Once again Bob Bly has come up with a clear, concise book that touches on all the basics you need to know to get your new business up and running.I bought this years ago when I was starting out as a professional copywriter, and it was--and is--an invaluable resource."
4,Great Christmas Gift,"Bought 3 for grandkids for Christmas, to get them ready for a Family camping trip to Assateague Island in May."
1,Trash,"Infantile depiction of politics, sex, and Panama itself. Insulting screenplay for the viewer. The movie is pure bravado and seems made-up on the fly. No sense of understanding for the people or politics of Panama. Shockingly bad."
1,Complete letdown,"I expected a film of at least some dramatic content with Geoffrey Rush alongside Brosnan, but sadly no. This film is awful. The screenplay is atrocious, the directing weak and the character played by Brosnan utterly appalling. My advice, don't waste your cash."
1,A Keeper? 40 Used DVDs for sale says it all.,"Aside from the competition of all the used copies now for fire-sale of this bogged-down story, what keeps me from pitching this DVD is to show it as an example of how badly some critics' ""masterpieces"" so completely miss the mark. If you want the ""anti-007"", view the quality of ""The Prisoner"" series. And that ""print-bite"" of this being ""Casablanca without heroes"", that's as much baloney as ""Subway without heroes"" (sandwiches)!"
1,Wasted effort,"Without a doubt this is one of the most alienating productions for otherwise good contributors; LeCarre and Brosnan. Having served in ""the trade"" from my twenties, I have encountered more than enough of the reprehensible elements that serve the intelligence field. But ""Tailor"" serves no redeeming message at all. If only to portray the negatives of human nature of some participants the field, the effort was wasted."
3,Decent Film,"This is the most ""Average"" Le Carre movie adaptation that I have seen. Tinker, Taylor and Smiley's People set a very high bar. Russia House and The Spy Who Came in From the Cold were above average. This film is worth watching, but not in the same league."
1,Worst movie I've seen in quite a while,"I can't believe there are reviews giving this movie more than one star! It is a very bad movie. The dialog is muffled and hard to hear in parts, the plot very thin, acting mediocre. Stay away from this movie, or at least rent it and see how bad it is first.Geoffrey Rush does a good job, as good as can be expected from this weak script."
1,A really stupid flick.,"I had a back pain, needed to lie down, and decided to look in the local newspaper what was on TV. This movie was listed with a 3-star (out of 4) rating, so I picked it to watch. I guess they would have given 3 stars to anything bashing American and British imperialism with its devilish plans against the proud people of Panama (which, if you don't know, is a Central American country, located where the canal is). There is absolutely nothing in this film to even partially redeem its incredibly silly premise. I first thought that the leading actor was James Woods, but it turned out to be another guy, what put the final nail in the coffin of my opinion. Save yourself the trouble."
1,The Second Worst Movie Ever Made.,"Absolutely terrible. What a pity, Mr. Rush is usually so wise in the films he stars in. This is certainly two hours you will never get back. I've been totally robbed."
3,Some good ideas...some problems...overall fair,"Geoffrey Rush, as the tailor, chose a poor accent for film, speaking in a whispering, mumbling voice -- especially near the beginning and end of the movie -- thus is painful to follow. (Possibly better sound recording would have helped a bit.)The actor interviews are quite interesting; however, the cinematography is extremely annoying (directed/edited by MTV rejects?). They keep cutting to tilted and/or waving views, black-and-white or filtered, making the viewer seasick. It's clear the director had no confidence that the actors would have anything worth listening to, or that the audience has perceptible attention spans.The basic idea of the story, which I will not spoil, is very good, but the execution (script/plot/visuals/colors/mood/tailor and some minor characters) is not up to the possibilities. It is nice to see Pierce Brosnan in a non-hero role. Overall, it is worth watching once, but not worth purchasing."
4,Clever parody... view this as a satire,"This film is a clever misrepresentation of all that James Bond stands for. If you expect this to be a serious spy thriller, you will be disappointed. Instead think of this as an exploitation of all of James Bonds weaker traits, in an attempt to rip-off the American and British governments."
2,Not Tailored Enough For Me...,"Available for rental, this slow spy thriller doesn't thrill very much. I love Geoffrey Rush and John Boorman. Unfortunaltely, they are both wasted on this proiject. Of course, Boorman wrote the film so I can't defend him there. You might remember Boorman's wqonderful Hope and Glory. Even The Emerald Forest was much better....anyway....boring! This proves to me that Ebert and Roeper's 'Two Thumbs Up' doesnt count for much anymore. ** stars."
1,Shockingly Terrible,"It's rare to a see a movie where it appears that the entire cast, director AND writer all phoned in their performances. But the Tailor of Panama is such a film. The heavy dialogue drowns itself and its actors, who don't seem to try to tread water. Rush and Brosnan are broad charicatures which might work in another film, but not here. The films jokes and attempts at wit are labored and artificial. What the heck does ""Casablanca without the heroes"" mean? The beauty of Casablanca was that there were no perfect heroes in that movie, everyone had their dark side. Watching this film made me flinch far too many times."
1,"DON""T WASTE YOUR MONEY!!!!","I saw this a few weeks ago with a friend, both of us kept looking at our watches to see how much longer before the torture would end, this movie was SLOW SLOW SLOW, with no real plot. It had some great actors in it too bad they were in such a horrible movie!"
3,Bad ending,"As a great fan of Le Carré I was very disappointed with the ending of this movie. I had hoped that the alternative ending was better, but it wasn't. Pierce Brosnan was good, though I had imagined that the actor was more like a Michael Caine-type. I don't think that Jamie Lee Curtis was the best for that part - at least not with Geoffrey Rush as her husband. However he was a perfect taylor."
3,Missed potential,"This uneven story can't be saved for me by the fact that I am a Big Brosnan fan. It is only a FAIR - 2.5 STAR movie, rounded up because I am a Brosnan fan."
4,A spy flick with a different angle and a streak of humor.,"This movie is the opposite of the Bond movies. This is not a showcase of the smooth or sophisticated. Most of the characters are seedy. They are generally examples of pride, greed, incompetence, and power mongering. However they are likeable and understandable in their own twisted ways. I am not suggesting that you'll like everything they do. Yet I found myself hoping for a happy ending for the primary characters. (I won't spoil it for you.) Also there is some great humor. I laughed at the vibrating bed scene. A must-see for a fresh look."
5,Tailored to perfection,The Tailor of Panama is an excellent and entertaining film. Both actors Pierce Brosnan and Geoffrey Rush bring a great sense of enjoyment to their characters. Mr. Brosnan brings a great sense of wickedness to his character Andy Osnard. Mr. Rush brings a great sense of naivetivity and at deception to his character Harry Pendel.When Harry begins to spin his lies to Osnard both men know what's going on.But they allow each other to keep going just to see were everything leads to. I really liked the ending of the film. I also enjoyed the way it was filmed the scenery of Panama is breathtaking and the music adds a sense of mystery and excotic feelings. Also the story is very interesing. Although at times the movie kinda drags along it is overall very enjoyable.I really liked this film and I think it's a very enjoyable movie.
2,Don't buy it to see Pierce. He's been in better movies.,"I actually went to see this movie in the theaters and I was severly disappointed. It's not that the acting is bad, but the movie as a whole is lacking. The main thing that kills it is the pacing. It is REALLY, REALLY slow - almost painfully so because after sitting through it, you really want an ending that at least makes it worth all your suffering . . . and it never comes. Very bad movie. I strongly suggest passing this one over."
3,Blu-Ray edition is average quality,"I must admit I do not share the other reviewers enthusiasm for this movie. It is definitely a B grade production and very corny at times. It is basically a slap stick send up of the 007 movies.This Blu-Ray edition has a very average video transfer, there is a lot of MPEG compression artifacts visible and blow me down, the sound track is only Dolby Digital 5.0 wheres the HD in that offering?"
3,odd,"that geoffrey rush, who IS the tailor of panama, lacks mention on the cast listing put up by amazon.odder still, since rush is, to my mind, one of the finest english speaking comedic--in the classical sense--actors in recent cinema. i judge him foremost, if only because he can buffoon without appearing ludicrous, but certainly any sensible criticism must take note of him.this film is without scope, direction, or incident and it would totally fail to impress if rush were absent from it.can someone advise me, then, why amazon so often ignores the stars of films when setting down the cast? especially the deserving and most accomplished?"
2,2 stars for what I was able to stay awake through........,"Ok, this isnt fair. Roger Ebert and that other dude loved this so naturally I gave it a try. Jeez people, do NOT try to watch this if you are the least bit tired. I was lost after the first 10 minutes. I feel that I am a fairly intelligent person too so I just don't get it. All I have to say people is at least rent this sucker before you buy it. I was 2 steps from buying it and I would've been crushed if I had. So so so so hard to follow and keep up with!"
3,"A must for fans, but not a great book","Rakoff, an assistant editor on the show, does his best to describe what it was like to work with McGoohan, Markstein, Tomblin, et al., but he only worked on a few episodes, and really saw only a sliver of the total picture. Too much of the book focuses on the rest of Rakoff's career as a writer and filmmaker, which is marginally interesting, but not Prisoner-related."
1,Not worth your time,"A very deceptive title. Ian Rakoff worked on only a few episodes and his accounts are limited to a few encounters with McGoohan and trivial gossip around the show. The book should've been titled ""Ian Rakoff: A bunch of stuff I did that had nothing to do with the Prisoner."" Maybe 25% of the book is about working on the show, the rest is about his career before and after which makes for poor reading. I didn't even finish it because after the sections about the Prisoner it completely lost my interest. Anything worthwhile about the Prisoner has been written about in other books. Avoid dissapointment."
4,A delightful story,"This account of what life may have been like in the Garden of Eden is based on the book of Genesis. It links dragons with dinosaurs while recounting the story of Adam and Eve. Christian parents (homeschoolers, especially) will enjoy sharing this book with their children. In the book that we have there is a CD Rom included. It includes the song ""When Dragons Heart's Were Good"" and also a reading of the story by the author. The illustrations are bright and colorful and will appeal to the young children that this book is geared toward. You need this book!"
5,LOVE,"I LOVE THESE SUNGLASSES!! These are my second pair, I left the first on top of my car and drove off. I am small, 5'2"", and they still fit good. GREAT, GREAT, GREAT"
1,junk-bad company,"they do not answer the phone,have called to say glasses cracked after 2 months,they have no phone service to talk to customer service-pissed"
5,Great for heavy scrubbing,I added this brush to my cleaning kit to aide in stubborn cleaning and those extended shooting trips to the range. I also use this brush as a secondary cleaning brush in my method of cleaning
5,A safe way to clean your gun,It's much more gentle compared to phosphor bronze or SS. They say it's safe but I still prefer a nylon since it works just fine if you don't postpone the cleaning for too long. Takes care of residue in a couple of swift passes and preps the bbl for further treatment.
4,Good product for the price !,"The mouse pad is pretty smooth, the thickness is about right.I bought the black pad, make sure you read the description before you order, to make sure you are getting the color you want."
2,Not bad but not as fast a slicker optical mouse pads,"I was disappointed because I was expecting a slick fast surface like optical mouse pads tend to use. Instead, it is similar to the cushion old-fashioned mouse pad and my optical mouse does not glide across it as well as it does on the harder surfaces. But as of 7/22/12, it is only $4!"
2,Inanely insipid,"Cary Grant and Sophia Loren performed their parts flawlessly. The plot, the props, the music, the lines were hopeless. Are we supposed to believe a foreign service officer would take his small children to a symphony concert? That the grown daughter of a world class conductor would sing the Bing-Bang-Bong song during the orchestra's performance? or any other time, for that matter? That Sophia professionally repaired and painted that houseboat all by herself in a couple of days while Cary was at the office? That a pitcher of water would be handy on the table on the porch just when necessary to use it to illustrate a moral principle? I'm not incapable of suspending belief, if only there's compensation for it. I only watched to the end because I was making out with my girlfriend during the movie. I'd have been better off watching ""Godzilla 1985""."
1,Unwatchable,"This is one of those films that are made to capitalize on star power, get quick results at the box office, and then disappear into the land of forgotten films.About a half hour into this debacle, which featured whiny children, predictable plotting, and overall lack of likable (or believable) characters, I was forced to just turn it off."
4,When it was enough for a movie simply to entertain...,"Charming is the word that best describes this movie--two charming stars and three charming children act out a charming story in a charming landscape. Although probably not ""great cinema"" by anyone's standard, it provides for me a welcome 2-hour escape from the stresses of modern life. In this fantasy world, you never doubt that Sophia Loren's ""fine Italian hand that can't cook, clean, or do the laundry"" will put everything right and that everyone will live happily ever after.Whenever I hear an ad for a modern movie that claims it will ""change my life"", I want to pull out an old movie like this whose ambition was simply to entertain."
5,Houseboat,Great pair to put together. Grant is alway excellent and Sophoia was at her best. Great family entertainment which there are few to choose from today. Recommend it most highly
4,A wonderful classic.,We enjoyed watching and remembering when movies were more about acting and not so much with all the special effects or political overtones. Look forward to finding and watching more classics like these.
5,A Bing Bang Bong...,"Sophia Loren and Cary Grant team up in this hysterical movie. He's a widower with three children and his widow's sister after him (since she was four years old). Sophia is the daughter of a rich Italian Band conductor - she runs away because she's tired of being told what to do - and becomes the nanny for Grant. The only problem is she can't cook or clean. But the children love her. And soon Grant does too. Two things I learned from this movie: Never park your house on the railroad tracks, and always tie your house tightly to the dock."
5,The Movie 'Boy on a Dolphin' is Sophia Loren's Best,"The Movie 'Boy on a Dolphin' is Sophia Loren's Best.But Houseboat is almost as good. If Sophia Loren is your cup of tea, (how can't she be?) then by all means feast your eyes. She's at her luscious prime here.God did some of his best work when he made Sophia Loren.A wonderful movie, lots of fun, and beauty."
4,Real life sexual tension on screen...,Grant and Loren are terrific together. It was during the making of this film that Cary Grant fell hopelessly with Sofia Loren. Grant is his usual charming self and he pours on the charm for her...and us. This is a must-have for Cary Grant film collectors. This is a fun memorable romantic comedy.
2,"Slight, predictable romantic comedy","A government official (Cary Grant) tries to reconnect with his children (Mimi Gibson, Paul Petersen, and Charles Herbert) after the death of his wife. The daughter of a symphony conductor (Sophia Loren) goes on the run to escape her overbearing father (Eduardo Ciannelli) and takes a job as nanny to the children. Romantic comedy ensues.If there is any reason to watch this film, it is the chemistry between Grant and Loren, who had been in a real life relationship not long before filming began. The situation, however, is highly contrived and the scriptwriters (Melville Shavelson and Jack Rose) are all too willing to cast all logic aside for the sake of some rather slight gags. Characters do not behave in a consistent fashion, their personalities changing as the script requires so that the story can hit every predictable plot point on the way to its happy ending."
3,house boat,"It was delivered a lot faster than they first stated.....so that was good. The quality of the DVD was OK.....colour could have been better and volume seemed to fluctuate throughout the movie......but it is still a nice,fun, family movie."
5,"Excellent, accurate, and detailed","This incredible book is a gem. Filled with black and white illustrations from the period in question, the fashion plates, drawings, caricatures, and portraits help create a strong sense of the 19th century. This book follows the gradual changes and shows the overall shape of each chunk of time in the form of silhouettes (The author prefaces each section with a gray on white figure outlining the nature of that time's costume). While this book may be out of print, it is well worth the search if your passion is costume history through primary resources, particularly that of the 19th century. The approach is purely pictorial, but if what you want to know is the look, this book is excellent."
3,Enjoyable,"This movie is enjoyable but it has been done numerously before. The 1986 movie ""Say Yes!"" starring Jonathan Winters and not to mention the remake of the Buster Keaton classic ""Seven Chances"". Great scenery! Enjoyable! 3 stars out of 5."
1,Thoughtless,"""The Bachelor"" looks and feels like it was conceived, written, and filmed over a long-weekend, as if it were a rehearsal for a real movie. Watching this is absolutely exhausting, as the script limps along in mind-numbingly obvious directions. Overall the acting is poor, but is otherwise shackled by inane dialogue. I'm ashamed for not having found something better to with with the 90+ minutes this movie stole from me."
4,Pretty Funny!,"Jimmie Shannon was to get marry (with some conditions attached, of course!) before his 30th birthday in order to the $100 million inheritance from his grandfather. The BIG problem was... Jimmie's birthday was the next day and he had to get hitched within 24 hours. The BIGGER problem was... Jimmie was still not ready for the idea of a marriage. But still, in order to get the inheritance, Jimmie proposed to his long-time girlfriend, Anne, anyway. Anne rejected his proposal straightaway as she could see that he was not sincere. Watch through the show to see ways that Jimmie came up with in order to get the inheritance... and whether he could get it , and Anne's hand, in the end.Watch this movie if you want a/many laugh(s)!"
4,Cute Girl Stuff,"Well, let me say that I might be a tiny bit biased in this review simply because Chris O'Donnell is just so cute.... but enough of my gushing! This is an adoreable film. Chris O'Donnell and Renee Zelwegger have great chemistry as a scared, emotionally unavailable bachelor and his spunky, tough, but loving girlfriend, respectively. They are believeable as a couple, which is essential to a good romance. The story is predictable, but none the less, enjoyable and funny. Brooke Shields is hysterical as one of O'Donnell's ex-girfriends who ponders marriage for the chance of inheriting a fortune. The film gives an adequate portrayl of the male mind, and how most men feel in regards to marriage. Overall, it is worth viewing and I highly recommend it to brides to be who are looking for films to watch with the girls at a sleepover or bachelorette party!"
3,"Cute, predictable romantic comedy is worth a rent.","Cute, predictable, but funny movie about a bachelor (Chris O'Donnell) who wants to remain a bachelor, but knows that he should get married to Renée Zellweger. When his rich uncle gives him incentive and a deadline, hilarity ensues. This movie got a boost from the Bay Area since it was primarily filmed in SF. Anyone who hates Renée Zellweger should not see this movie, but if you could stand her in ""Jerry Maguire"", you can watch her in this movie. Three stars. Josh Bob says check it out if you have a date."
3,SORT OF LIKE....HAMLET,"This perceptive and clever tale was probably written by Shakespeare. How cool! Man has to marry quickly, or lose inheritance. Nearly as good as the Three Stooges version, this art house presentation....OK, OK, OK. Obviously this movie was made to make a buck. But it does have it's moments. Zelwinger is sooo pretty! The greedy mob of brides descending on San Fransisco is rather amusing, and it's neat to see the old guys show up in a new film. Zelwinger and O'Donnell pay it straight, and that makes it even funnier. Now, there is something weird about the timeline. I didn't now a person could call in a classified ad in the middle of the night and see it appear in a newspaper that has already been pressed. So, I guess we just have to ignore details and physics and things like that. And it has the happiest ending that has ever taken place on a fire escape! If your girlfriend is the special ed type, she'll love it. Order the cheese pizza now!"
3,I SAW IT,"Easy on the eyes, and not too complicated, this nearly B-MOVIE is actually kind of fun. Great to see O'Donnell in a different kind of role. Zelwinger ofcourse is great - her character is a bit annoying at times - , but it's the cameos that help move the film along. He must Marry soon! Or he stands to lose millions. Desperate, he runs a classified ad, and it somehow appears in the next paper. How did he do that? It takes me three days to run an ad. The scene of goldiggers chasing him around San Fransisco is as funny as it is stupid. Citizen Kane it's not, but it's OK. She'll like it."
4,Great fun for all!,"This movie is Fun. Just fun. Not brilliant, nothing new, and not hilarious. But it is fun and enjoyable. This is a wonder film to own or rent. Not only does it provide a laugh, but also a smile. It's a perfect date movie. The Bachelor has its moments. Chris O'Donnell is perfectly casted as a bachelor learning to take the next step to marriage. His supporting cast is wonderful as well. They make friendship worthwhile with moments of exasperation and frustration, but that's what friendship is all about! I enjoyed this movie. I didn't give this movie too much expectations but it surprised me. It gave me a wonderful flick that I'll be recommending to friends .... It's not your Jim Carey humor, it's not your typical romance movie, and it's not your cheesy remake either. It's a nice, warm and friendly movie geared for those who likes comedy-romances. It's a fun movie. It's better than expected and it's enjoyable."
2,could have been better,"This movie just felt so cheesy and its so pathetic how this guy asks every woman to marry him. Its a fun date movie but that's all, nothing special. I just felt that the whole movie was recycled and I'm one of those people that wants a little more originality to movies. Besides it reminds me of those cheesy reality tv shows that they have on tv. It just didn't work for me."
3,Great Movie For Couples,"This movie is by no means a perfect movie. It has its flaws but that doesn't take away from just how likable it is. Ladies, this is the movie to watch with your boyfriends/husbands/whatevers. They'll enjoy it just as much as you. Guys, buy this bad boy and watch it with your significant other. They'll love it and you'll like it, too. It's not a ""chick flick"" at all. It's a very funny romantic comedy that never gets sappy or dippy."
2,Corny Predictable 13-in-a-dozen Lovestory,"I watched this movie in the cinema and it was for my friends that I didn't leave after 30 minutes. This movie is so predictable that you already know how it is going to end after 15 minutes. I have to admit the first 10 minutes were endurable but after that... This movie is really very bad. The cast is uninspired and uncharismatic and the story is just a 13-in-a-dozen routine lovestory. An absolutely ""no go""."
2,Almost...,"The Bachelor is a movie with great intentions. The plot is cute, even though unrealistic. The actors are even good. However, that je ne sais quoi, the indescribable something, that all great movies have is missing from this film. I found myself during the comedic scenes wanting to laugh, but not finding any reason to do so. The touching scenes almost warmed my heart, but not quite. I wanted to like the movie, but I couldn't. The characters were unlikeable, however well acted. The only enjoyable part was Anne played by Renee Zellwegger and, unfortunately, too much of the movie was absent of her. Somewhere along the road to greatness, The Bachelor stopped at mediocrity. Trust me, this one isn't worth the trip."
2,"If you plan to sit through this, bring a good book.",The story: a confirmed bachelor has a choice between marrying the pig he is currently dating or not. His uncle dies and gives him an ultimatum and a time-limit: marry or lose a fortune. Bachelor looks up every girl he was ever involved with. Too late. They're taken now. He should have married them when he had the chance. He marries the pig.Funny. Ha. Ha. The only bit of amusement is a few minutes of Peter Ustinov as the uncle. Those who watch this will get what they deserve.
2,Not much redeeming value,"I don't mind implausible stories, but only if the film makers can pull it off. I was sad to discover that Chris O'Donnell can't act. I hadn't noticed before because he was well cast in a few other roles, but fortunately never had to carry a story. Part of the problem might go to the director. In fact the director is highly suspect. The timing was off and there is no evidence that the man in charge had any clear view of what he wanted to bring out in the characters or storyline. I was sorry I spent the money on the rental. Don't bother."
2,Not So Great,"Chris O'Donnell certainly has the potential to be a great actor. He should not waste is time selling just his pretty face. The plot was non-existent and when it existed it was too transparrent.We love Renée Zellweger, her roll in Jerry Macquire was perfect. She had virtually no lines worth remembering. The best part of the film came when the Priest was speaking with O'Donnel on the lake near the Palace of Fine Arts. O'Donnell realized what love was, at least for him.One more point. Unless Renée Zellweger's character and that of her roommate were making more than $500,000 per year, they could not have afforded that appartment. I have been in that appartment, the rent was $5,500 per month and the condo was worth more than $1.5 million. You figure!"
2,Mindless and Senseless,"I do not understand how anyone could have enjoyed this film. The acting was terrible, as was the story. It barely held my attention, and I also felt that it was demeaning to women, in that it portrayed women as stereotypical psycho's who will do anything to get married, and to get their hands on a man's money! Renee Zelwegger & Chris O'Donnell were both a waste this film. I wouldn't watch it again, and wished I'd have listened to others who told me not to see it ..."
5,I LOVE THIS NEW ARTIST!!,"I picked up this album on a recommendation from a friend and was pleasantly surprised at what I heard! As I listened each track became my favorite song. It's got a lot of depth and variety with everything from pop to blues to ballads...and then there's ""Tangier"" which has a latin/world music feel all it's own. Each song tells a story through visual lyrics and beautiful arrangements that really show off the versatility of Holly Light's voice. In a nutshell it's got great music, great lyrics and a great vibe. I can't recommend it highly enough!!!"
3,More Like A Soundtrack But Enjoyable,"Nelson's third album is dramatic with short clip from TV programs aptly used. The story is themed with TV dominance with human mind but it sounds like a beginning of an epic. Is it going to be like Phantom Menace or Evangelion series?In music side if you have ever heard of any Nelson albums you will notice that it is not so much of their regular style. Its tone became a bit darker and heavier. Songwriting is not as fabulous as Nelson masterpieces such as After The Rain, Life and Silence Is Broken. Yet Nelson style music can be found as in ""Sooner Or Later"" or ""Tell Me"". And ""Action""(Sweet classic known by Def Leppard cover) in the mid part starting like Peter Schilling's Major Tom shows a climax of this album very dramatic and Broadway musical like. Overall it is enjoyable.The script for a movie or TV drama based on this soundtrack would give this album more spotlight. For music fans first to Nelson try either After The Rain, Silence Is Broken or Life first."
1,It was beyond bad,plain and simple I was disappointed in this album. no wonder the record label didn't want them to release it.
1,Thumbs down from a huge Yes fan,"I got all five solo efforts by the members of Yes in 1975-1976, and the only good thing you can say about this one is that Alan White's effort (Ramshackle) was worse.As the other reviewers note, Steve Howe simply can't sing, and I find his attempts unlistenable. Those of you accustomed to crystal clear vocals from Jon Anderson are in for quite a shock if you get this album.Steve's guitar playing can also be pretentious, and this album lacks other band members to control those impulses. Don't get me wrong - he's a great guitar player. But I prefer good music to continuous displays of virtuosity. He seems to always being trying to say ""Hey, look how good I am"", instead of just trying to make good, coherent, well-structured music.If you like Yes stuff from this period, and want to sample the solo efforts, try Chris Squire's ""Fish Out of Water"" first. You'll be glad you did."
4,Nice album,I had the L.P. years ago and decided to buy the CD. It was good to hear it again. It will be a nice addition to your collection.
5,This still remains my favorite Steve Howe solo album,"I know, I must be a freak, but I have grown to love Steve's off key warbling. I love to sing along in the car (but get in big trouble if someone is in the car with me...) These are all well crafted songs, not just showing off his guitar talents."
3,A voice only a mother could love.,"Steve Howe was not placed on this earth to stand in front of a microphone. It's a pity this brilliant guitarist could not recognise that his lack of vocal ability would so detract from this otherwise fine recording. As one would expect the musicianship is terrific, the compositions strong, and of all the Howe solo efforts this is perhaps the most Yes-like in sound and composition. Bruford, Moraz and White all guest here. In spite of the weak vocals it is still quite an enjoyable recording and worth obtaining, just not essential...Simon"
4,"Almost too much sex, but good.","The narrator (who shares the author's name) tells a friend about his gay sexual adventures. They start with two of his high school friends. Some other friends witness one of those encounters and make life hard for young Donovan.After graduation, Donovan moves to New Orleans, where he begins experimenting with more gay men. When his parents decide to sell their house, he moves back home for a while to help with that. His time at home leads to more sex, of course, including an S&M; experience. It keeps going from there, until he finally meets the right guy in New Orleans.There is almost too much sex in this book, with little time to catch your breath in between, but it's still good."
3,Good but Could be Better,"The trademark of John Cassavetes films is emotions laid bare. You might call this an emotion strip tease without the tease. This film is no exception. However, it is not as focused as his later Woman Under the Influence or Opening Night. Some scenes loose their effectiveness by their length. A tighter editing would have worked wonders. Nevertheless, the film has a strong emotional impact, a harbinger of his later films, and arresting structural innovations; well worth watching."
2,Difficult Viewing,This film is difficult to watch for many reasons. It is below average both artistically and technically. The film is a classic of its genre but for me HUSBANDS and WOMAN UNDER THE INFLUENCE are much better as films. [Note how the excessive laughter in FACES is annoying and unrealistic whilst in HUSBANDS it is natural and enjoyable.]
2,Not Your Mainstream Film,"I thought Cassavetes' ""A Woman Under the Influence"" was brilliant, but I'm sorry to say I only lasted 20 minutes into Faces before turning it off. I know it is supposed to be ground-breaking, influential, a masterpiece, etcetera, but I just could not take the annoying characters any longer. The first 20 minutes appeared to be some improvisational piece that had over-stayed its welcome.I respect what Cassavetes did for American independent film, but I think you really have to love experimental film to enjoy Faces."
1,Oh ! the pain.,"I remember buying this album in anticipation that they would continue where ""Sir Army Suite"" left off. Unfortunately my hopes were dashed and found myself with a new frisbee. I tried listening to it a couple days later hoping that what I heard was a bad dream and that it would be something I could salvage...only ""all good things"" was the only track that had an ounce of playability attached to that word.There so-called come back album or final epitah ""Magentalane"" would only confirm the bloom was off the rose and that Klaatu had nothing more in the tank or anything to offer."
2,A Sad Album to Listen to,"Klaatu had some real magic. At their best they were every bit as good and original as any group that has ever existed. Name any supergroup...and that group will not have more innate talent. However, this album is like going to the generic aisle in a supermarket and picking up a box called ""Competently Played Pop Music (Soul Free.)"" It's like eating tasteless food, or drinking flat soda, or making love with someone you really don't love. Whoever brought this travesty about is evil - and it was NOT Klaatu. Do yourself a favor and skip this one. You have four other albums of genuine wonder and magic, and that's more than most bands ever create. Do whatever you can to get Magentalane - If you love Klaatu, you will listen to it many times."
1,Yikes!,"With the exception of the first track, I Can't Help It, there is absolutely nothing worthwhile on here. It sounds like they phoned it in on this one. It must have been a contractual obligation record and is actually a painful listen. All you need to play is the track Sell Out, Sell Out and you'll catch on. Sell out, Sell Out ... says it all."
1,Sorry I bought it.,"Less than three months after purchase, it's in the shop; an authorized repair center. Picture started ""snapping"" 'till no more picture. They replaced the picture tube and something else. I took it home. Then, it started displaying flickering white lights across the top of the screen and a vertical rectangular discoloration on the left side of the screen. They've been working on it for a week ..."
2,Frustrated Viper Pool Cleaner Owner,"I have had my pool for 5-6 years. This is the fourth Viper Pool cleaner I have owned. When it is working it does a wonderful job. Unfortunately this last one broke only after 2 weeks. They have changed the design over the years I guess in an attempt to improve the product. Unfortunately I seems that the manifold is what needs improvement. I have found that it is cheaper to buy an entire cleaner as opposed to buying replacement parts (hoses, swivels, etc.). I will be sending this one back. Hopefully the next one I get will last longer than a year."
3,can't tell any difference in water quality,"i wanted a filtered shower because i have sensitive skin, and after reading all the great reviews on filtered showers making skin and hair softer and healthier, decided to try one. Well, i can't tell any difference whatsoever in my hair or skin after using this about a month now. perhaps there just wasn't much chlorine in my water to begin with? i never had a problem with dry hair, just with sensitive, dry skin. anyway the showerhead itself is nice and i love the metal hose which hangs down nicely and doesn't stick out like plastic ones. it's also very easy to turn the head to adjust the spray setting, which i know on some other showerheads that part can be hard to grasp. i also like the types of sprays it has, there are two settings that feel really great. however, the water pressure's a little decreased, and the handle itself could use some grips to make it easier to hold. it's a good showerhead but i suspect there's better ones on this website."
1,Waste of Money,We purchased this product because of its filteration system claiming it would help eliminate hard water stains on our shower doors and walls. It does not work at all and the design of the shower head is ugly. The product was delivered as promissed but without any return address or customer service information.
2,Disappointing!,"This is a compilation of training films and old b&w films, repeated over and over in the DVDs. Poorly done."
4,Gift for brother,"This was a gift for my little brother. It is still in its plastic case and was really a good quality action figure. I love Bossk from Empire Strikes back, this series of figures is a must for any collector or kid."
2,Slightly dated,"Two friends of mine ranted and raved how this movie was fantastic. Now, admittedly they weren't comparing it to the likes of ""Avengers"" or even ""Taken"", but they said I simply HAD to see it.I didn't see the hype. Don't get me wrong, I'm a big fan of all three of the actors in it. I guess I just couldn't get behind the story. And cinematography wise it's got the feel of a made-for-TV movie, not an actual cinematic outing.Is it a MUST SEE flick...not really. Catch it if you've got some free time & don't have anything better to watch. But it's a long way from Liam's best work."
2,Don't waste your time,"Liam plays a character whose undercover cop career has reached the point of turning him into a mental wreck with serious gastrointestinal issues. The story stinks, the acting is mostly marginal (Sandra Bullock is good as always, but is a small role here) and this was simply just a total waste of time."
1,Really aweful movie!,Extremely boring with a very weak storyline. This is compounded by the fact that it is very poorly executed. You will start snoring after the first 10 minutes as you realize that there is no character development at all! This movie was so aweful it put me off from seeing other movies for a week...it was that bad! Minus 2 stars!
2,Awful,This was a terrible movie. Liam Neeson and Sandra Bullock should have stayed far away from this movie and made sure it was never released. The only redeeming feature was the performance of Oliver Platt.
3,pretty good,"Charlie was a top-flight federal agent. Then a mob sting went wrong, leaving one of his cooeagues dead. Now, Charlies in therapy, looking forward to retirement. But there's one assignment left, and he's the only one who can tackle it."
5,"dvd of 1999 sandra bullock film...brand new, shipped on time, exclellent wrapping.","prodict arrived early, and was brand new....expected a reconditioned used version...was quite pleased with price, delivery, and product.chris"
2,Not good,"This is not a good movie. Neeson is so wooden, even when crying, he should be standing in front of a cigar store. Bullock is her normal chirpy self, cute but with limited depth. The premise is misguided, and the writing and editing perfunctory. All of the actors can be seen in better performances elsewhere. Save your money."
3,Boring as can be,This movie is boring and I dont have much to say about this movie exept dont waste your time or money.
5,"An Underrated, Underseen Gem","Apparently this movie got lost in the shuffle somehow (see other reviews)and it is a shame, because it is a very funny, semi-black comedy that deserved a broader audience. While Liam Neeson is not usually cast in comedies, he should do more of them because he was very good as Charlie, the burned-out drug agent and he was surrounded by a great cast, topped by Oliver Platt, who was, as usual, excellent, and Sandra Bullock, who had a small but effective part as Charlie's no-nonsense girlfriend. Mary McCormick was hilarious in a tiny, almost unrecognized part as Fluvio's (Pratt's) caustic wife and the group of sadsacks who made up Charlie's therapy group added their own comic note. I would recommend this to anyone who just wants to relax and have a nice, uncomplicated laugh and enjoy two very attractive leading actors."
3,A social scientific nightmare,"This book is an interesting read but is so sloppy in its scientific approach that it makes the serious student of social science want to cry. Though Bellah argues that social science must be like public philosphy, the reader still wonders whether he takes this stuff seriously or not. A more disciplined approach would have been warranted for such sweeping conclusions.END"
2,Nature of the Beast,"It's quite interesting in that is shows what makes the people of this nation tick, by looking at their traditions and examining their ideologies. It addresses the breakdown of traditional communities and human interactions. But the conclusions this book comes to should be quite horrifying to any RATIONAL Joe. The tone of the book is that we are all social animals that live, interact.... and work together in a community based on responsibility to care for others. It is true that we are social animals and that recently people have grown cold to each other...but the solution is not to enslave people with some ""inherent responsibility"" to others. The book's states that we will only become ""human by accepting our essential poverty as a GIFT, and to share our material wealth with those in need.""......this is the most anti-American book I've read which tries to fix the social climate in the most horrifying ways. This is SOCIALISM disguised as a Traditional American Way of Life."
5,Interviews with Americans tell the truth about Individualism,"This book is about the inevitable conflict between American Individualism and the fact that humans are by nature social. We hunger for relationship yet we want it only on our terms. Bellah and his team of reseachers take on the enormous task of interviewing people from all over the country and the results of these interviews are presented factually and then analyzed. Whether one agrees with the book's conclusions or not, the interviewees speak for themselves, and they speak for a majority of Americans today who are often torn by conflicting authoritative messages and motives from without and within. This book is a marvelous and sometimes unsettling mirror into contemporary American society."
5,Excellent,This album is excellent. The Coconutheads are a terrific Florida Reggae band. I recommend this CD to all my friends who enjoy light reggae. This is great summer music.
4,Coconutheads,"I've followed The Coconutheads since the early nineties as they've performed throughout south Florida. Their live performance would make a great album too! Val and Greg have a have an almost telepathic connection on stage... their saxophonist (Nicky, I think) is outrageous, mixing in jazzy, moody tones with great skill. The band has had some personnel changes, but the core members have stayed intact, although I miss the live drummer."
3,Overpriced,"Product is good, but you can get the same effect much cheaper. Can't justify paying what I did. Infact, If anything I should have bought the one for anal sex that numbs things up a bit. This is like any other silicone product - you can pick something up from CVS and do just as well."
5,THE STANDBY,I have used this product for years. I personally enjoy having a few quality lubricants available to me at any given time. Eros Original is always the ONE that I never rotate in my search for the best lubes. Enjoy
5,Never fails,"It's great stuff for the intended purpose. Never dries out, very little needed. Because you use so little, it's actually very inexpensive if you buy it in large containers like this one."
5,review bodyglide,Pjur Original Bodyglide is probably the smoothest and most comfortable personal lubricant ever in my experience and I am on my second bottle. Pjurfect
5,BEST LUBE EVER,"This lube is wonderful. It does exactly what it needs to do. The best quality lube I have ever used. Your skin even feels smooth after using it, instead of slimy and gross like other brands.This lube makes everything feel better.Great!"
3,Sillicone vs Water Based,Seems to work ok but the quantity is too little bit for the price. Requires less though than water based.
4,Good Product - Stains can be dealt with,"I also found this to be a good product and also originally found it to stain any fabric it came in contact with. However, when I contacted Pjur Customer Service, they suggested I try OxiClean or a similar formulation. That did in fact get out the stains."
5,"Clean, Scentless, Wife is not allergic",My wife is highly allergic and it has been quite difficult to find something that is ok for us to use. This is the only product that isn't sticky and fits that profile. Worth the higher price...
2,It is greasy,I bought this because of the men's health endorsement. My wife and I used it a few times and then desisted. It's ok for intercourse but not other activities.
2,Not what I expected,"This product after reading several reviews posted gave the impression that Pjur was an exceptional product. From what I have found when using Pjur is that the product dries out to soon and does not last long in the area applied. My spouse and I have used Pure Romance ""Just Like Me"" for years. Pure Romance product stays alot longer after comparing, also has more slip and wetness about it."
2,not good,"I tried several different products. Actually, this is not good comparing to others.It's sticky. I won't buy it any more."
2,"Oversimplified, redundant, not culturally sensitive","I think that this book has some very good aspects if you like your books watered down. Fox oversimplifies the ""helping process"" and in each chapter he likes to state the same thing in 5 different ways and call it his own. Fox also assumes that this framework will work for every population of people, and for this I think he fails to address cultural differences as well as marginalized populations."
5,Great Love Story,"This is the ultimate movie experience; they just don't make love stories like this anymore. I feel that William Shakespeare himself would have given the screen play five stars if he were alive today. This is not the original version of this movie but I feel that it is the most entertaining of the bunch. The costumes, the music, the surroundings all fit perfectly to accomplish a work of art. This would be the ideal movie to watch on a rainy night right in front of the fire place. I recommend it highly for those of you looking for the ultimate love Story."
5,Always so good!,"I went to see this movie when it came out in 1968 when I was 12. This is the best ""Romeo&Juliet"" movie ever. Olivia Hussey and Leonard Whiting are forever. Actors/actresses, music, costume, location and so on... Everything was perfect. Love this movie."
1,Romeo and Juliet,This DVD can't be played as it's region 1 and Australia is in Region 2. Waste of time and money.
5,Romeo & Juliet,This was the absolute best production of Shakespeare's Romeo & Juliet made to date. Hard to obtain from any other source. A truly cherished movie.
5,Great Deal,"This video was on our daughter's Christmas list. Found it on Amazon, ordered it and it arrived in mint condition and in a timely manner. Would order from this dealer again!!!"
4,The Best Movie Adaptation,"Out of all the movie adaptations, and age aside, this one is simply the best! I have used at least three different movie adaptations of Shakespeare's Romeo and Juliet, to help my students understand the complexities of language and plot within the play, and for some reason this one does the trick. There are a few differences and creative liberties taken within this adaptation, as with any of the other R & J movies. Yet the liberties taken take nothing away from the play's overall theme. If you are looking to show this film to your students or child, be aware that there is a brief nude scene at the beginning of Act 3 Scene 4."
3,Romeo and Juliet,"Even though this is a beautiful movie, a favorite from my early teen years, the quality of the DVD leaves something to be desired. It does not appear that any attempt at sound or film clean up was made. There are no special features to speak of. Perhaps the producers are waiting for the 40th anniversary to make some effort at producing a truly outstanding DVD."
5,Romeo and Juliet,"My favorite version of this oft-filmed classic is Zeffirelli's Oscar-nominated version. Starring two unknowns in the title roles (17-year-old Whiting and 15-year-old Hussey), the movie remains true to Shakespeare, while making the language more accessible to modern audiences. Both Michael York (as Romeo's nemesis, Tybalt) and Milo O'Shea (as Mercutio) lend strong support, while Zeffirelli's unabashed romanticism is enhanced by magnificent period detail and a sweeping score from Nino Rota. The story of youthful rebellion also spoke to basic issues arising in the restive sixties. A top-notch rendering of an eternal classic."
5,The definitive Romeo & Juliet!,"Italian director Franco Zeffirelli did an outstanding job of bringing Shakespeare's romantic tale to life. It is THE definitive version of Romeo & Juliet, in my opinion. The fact that the actors were so close to the age of the star crossed lovers adds realism and freshness to the story.Shakespeare's words flow so naturally that you forget that it is a classic play and just get lost in the story. The cinematography is beautifully done and the wonderful customes are a treat for the eyes!You will enjoy this movie ... again, and again ... I highly recommend it!"
5,Zeffirelli's Romeo and Juliet,"As a high school English teacher, I show this film every year to my students and they love it. Some even love it more than the Luhrmann version in 1996. What is so helpful is that now it's on DVD-rather than VHS-I no longer have to fast forward and rewind to get to the right part. Plus the wide-screen layout gives more of the picture and the beautiful Verona scenery! This is a must for any English teacher or Shakespeare lover!"
5,Romeo and Juliet directed by Franco Zeffirelli,"The scenery, cinematography, and music all serve the story so well. If one is a little bothered by the fact the first part of the film is slow paced then be patient for the pace and drama appropriately intensify toward the middle of the film. The relatively unknown actors are perfect in their roles - even the minor characters are excellent and add so much to the overall effectiveness of the drama. I highly recommend seeing this one."
5,Human Emotion transcends time............,"I first saw this film in eighth grade for an English assignment,and now nearly 20 something years later it is still powerful. The movie is beautifully filmed ,the actors are each perfect for the roles and the costumes are gorgeaus. The spirit of the film ,of youthful passion is felt and the two lead actors-Leonard Whitting and Olivia Hussey portray that effortlessly. Even though the film is 37 years old today it still grabs your attention and leaves you rapt in emotion - exhilaration, adoration, passion ,sadness, disbelief, and finally regretful grief. The director has made a classic that transcends time because he makes us see what the characters feel."
5,This has been my favorite movie since it came out in 1968!,"This is a movie with virtually no flaws -- the casting is superb, the story is, of course, classic, and the settings are beautifully rustic. Even the music is perfect."
5,Romeo and Juliet,This product was delivered in great condition. I have had no problems with the disk itself at all. Great movie.
5,A real winner,Watched this while a senior in high school. One of my all time favorites. Can't say enough things about customes and acting in this one. Get it.
1,The disc is scratched,"I purchased this online because it stated the disc was in good condition and I cannot watch but twenty minutes of it before it is freezing up, skipping and delaying. You get what you pay for, I guess."
5,Have always loved this movie,"This movie never disappoints. It is classic, well done and the music is great.Leonard Whiting and Olivia Hussey are Romeo and Juliet."
3,R & J,"I bought this movie to show to a ninth grade English class. I'm thankful I watched it before I showed it because it was rated PG, and I thought it would be fine to show the whole movie. However, there was a great amount of nudity and should never have been rated PG. The film wasn't too bad, but I was expected more. The lines seemed rushed, especially Juliet's. The men's costumes detracted rather than added to the film."
2,High school drama.,"Bloated 1968 version of Shakespeare's tale of star-crossed lovers. Despite the incredibly expensive production design, despite the authentic costumes and locales, despite the doubtless much-rehearsed sword-duel between Leonard Whiting and Michael York, despite the then-relevant echoes of youth counterculture, the movie remains reminiscent of a Cliffs Notes Shakespeare put on by your local high school. In one respect it's refreshing to see actual teenagers play the roles: the old familiar lines in the text seem almost new, as spoken by Whiting and Olivia Hussey, probably because the lines weren't so old or familiar to them. But that finally doesn't compensate for the fact that as actors they're simply too young to handle the verse. Zeffirelli tried to put as much realism, emotional and pictorial, as possible into his movie -- but he probably should've asked himself whether that very realism defeated the whole purpose of the play by Shakespeare."
2,Horrible Acting,"I read the play Romeo and Juliet in my Shakespeare class, and thought is was a very good play. But when I saw this movie I was very dissapointed. The acting in the movie is just HORRIBLE.On all the parts, it is either overdone or underdone.And on top of that,they cut out alot of dialogue toward the end.I think there is a reason why Shakespeare wrote these plays for the stage. I would reccomend the version with Leonardo Dicaprio and Claire Daines over this one."
2,Romeo And Juliet,"I think this movie follows the play very well, but scene 13 is horrible. There is full nudity which is not necessary. I have seen movies and plays and am shocked that a G rated movie would show not only Romeo's rear but Juliet's breasts. I would never recommend this version for students of any age."
3,why?,"For goodness's sake, Franco, do we really need to see gratuitous shots of Romeo's derrierre? I think not. And Shakespeare wrote this as a play, to be performed as written, not to have crucial parts taken out or changed. And don't get me started on the absurd costumes! Yeesh! Well, I suppose it is the best version of Shakespeare's most famous play that's out there, which isn't fair. Where's Kenneth Branagh when you need him?"
1,not good franco,"this movie was just bad. several important scenes and speeches were left out, the actors overacted everything(esp.Romeo and Juliet). and there was no need for a 2 minute gratuitous shot of romeo's butt"
5,THE BEST VISUAL INTERPRETATION OF ROMEO AND JULIET,"SHAKESPEARE, WOULD HAVE BEEN PROUD THAT THIS MASTERPIECE WAS VISUALLY SCULPTED WITH THE AUTHENTIC DIGNITY AND PURE INNOCENCE AND BEAUTY, THAT ONE WOULD HAVE THOUGHT COULD NOT COMPETE WITH SHAKESPEARE'S GENIUS VERBALITY."
5,Romeo and Juliet (the good one),"This is a masterful work of art. Franco Zeffirelli did a breathtaking job of interpreting the play just how Shakespeare would have wanted it. Olivia Hussy makes a breathtaking Juliet, and the chemistry between the two young lovers was portrayed beautifully. All in all it is a wonderfull veiwing experience and I highly recomend it."
4,"Romeo, Romeo......wherefore art thou?","I first saw this film many many years ago.......and it's as wonderful as I thought it was.......I love Shakespeare's poetry.....it's just beautiful to listen to. The performances are top-notch - and Leonard Whiting and Olivia Hussey are absolutely gorgeous! I think that's what Zeffirelli was going for - truly young and beautiful people in these immortal roles. They are just so young and gorgeous and passionate - just what you need to play Romeo and Juliet. This particular disc has no extras - merely the theatrical trailer, but what I really wanted was just to see the film again after quite some time had passed; extras were not that important to me. It hews pretty closely to Shakespeare's original text and story. Beautiful cinematography, wonderful costumes.....I enjoyed it and was not disappointed."
5,Romantic and fantasticly portrayed.,"It impacted me like no other version of this fabulous piece by the great Sheakespeare. Fantastic; it made me laugh, cry and kept me glued to my seat the whole time. The acting was great quality- I recommend it for study or even if you are just looking for entertainment. Much better than the Leonardo DiCaprio version."
3,Romeo & Juliet,"Loved the movie. Saw it years ago when it was first released.The DVD would not work on any of my players, (different setup in Australia). Had to watch it on my laptop by changing region setting, then changing back after.(bit scary)"
3,Looking for something to help instead of just the book version.,"This movie was okay. The dialogue is just like the book, so if you find the book challenging to get through then you will stumble through the mumble and language in the movie. I bought this as a recommendation to help my daughter who is required to read the book."
5,Gorgeous,"My assessment of Olivia Hussey's acting fluctuates every time I see this but, if nothing else, the fact that she can draw your attention away from the visual magnificence of this film must say something. It's the most lively of Shakespeare movies, in part because the language is beautiful, as is the scenery, the cast (who wouldn't fall for Leonard Whiting?), the costumes, and the music. It was rightly popular."
2,IRRESPONSIBLE!,"The film looks great, the music is legendary, so why can't I recommend this love story? I have two quibbles, and they are BIG ones: 1) For those who haven't seen the film, the titular star-crossed lovers of this piece both commit suicide, and this is a bad message to be sending today's youth. Would it not have made for a more happy and dramatic ending had the Capulets and the Montegues worked out their differences? My second knock is levelled against the film's screenwriter. People talk REALLY weird in this movie and half the time I couldn't figure out what they were saying!!! To sum up, this film is an incoherent and socially irresponsible mess!"
5,Romeo & Juliet DVD,I have loved this movie since I first viewed it in the theater in the 60's. It's my favorite version and the actual DVD is perfect in every way.
5,The Best Movie Version of Romeo and Juliet Yet,"Romeo and Juliet has been remade over and over on film, but this version with Olivia Hussey as Juliet is the one that embodies the play as classically as possible. The sets appear authentic, filmed in Europe, and the actors close to the age and description as the play. Olivia Hussey as Juliet is lovely and sweet, just as we imagine Juliet to be."
5,"Brilliant, timeless, the reference!",This is the definitive Romeo & Juliet! It's so brilliantly made. Absolutely stunning. It's so bitter sweet. Olivia Hussey is perfect and Leonard Whiting equals her in this timeless story. One of those extremely rare films that can bring me to tears...
4,Tante,"Anne Douglas Sedgwick, although born in New Jersey, spent her entire life after the age of nine in England, and many of her novels have an English setting. This novel is about a selfish, egomaniacal concert pianist (Tante) who almost ruins the life of her doting adopted daughter (Karen). Karen marries Gregory Jardine, and Jardine and Tante grow to hate each other; Karen, out of her blind devotion to Tante, leaves Jardine. Later Tante reveals her true tyranical colors to Karen, and Karen is able to break with her and save herself (and return to Jardine). Sedgwick was an excellent writer (Henry James admired her work), and this novel is exciting and skillfully written - even though some of the antics are a bit overheated in a melodramatic, soap-operish way. Mrs. Talcott, an American in the novel (and a real ray of light in a darkly tempestuous setting), sees through everybody and makes it all come out right in her practical, sensible manner. Well done!"

5,Hilarious Game! Played & Laughed,"I found this game at a thrift store last week. A group of eight adults (ranging from 21-38 yrs.) played this game for two hours!! We were all laughing so much at our ridiculous ""off the top of your head answers"". Made for a fun Thanksgiving post-meal game."
1,This is not worth buying...,"I purchased this product and used it for a couple months... and the click of death happened.I UPS'ed it to the Seagate specified RMA center and received UPS confirmation that someone signed for it at their reps facility.Unfortunately whoever signed for it misplaced it and SEAGATE, is stalling on sending me a replacement drive. The drive was received 11 days ago and they can't get any confirmation from their shipping and receiving dept.I didn't purchase this from amazon, but wish I hadn't purchased it from anyone else either.SEAGATE customer service is the worst, a five year guarantee attracted me to seagate, but it doesn't appear to be worth much."
3,"Not as good as the original, but still entertaining","Airplane 2 is a decent sequel, but the jokes and dialogue are not as clever or witty as in the original."
3,I like silly comedies with nonsensical humor!!,"Not as funny as Airplane but still has some hilarious scenes especially William Shatner's spoofing Star Trek with his character Murdoch looking at the blinking red lights on the computer panel and going crazy because of the constant blinking and his looking though a periscope and seeing the Enterprise, and also funny is the spoof of Hal the computer from 2001 a Space Odyssey. Okay I like intelligent dramas and comedies too but I also like a silly movie like this that has slapstick sight gags silly dialogue and just nonsensical humor because it is so silly that it is perfect to watch when you have had a terrible day and you are feeling a lttle down, when I have had a day like that a movie like this makes me feel better!"
4,"""Things sure haven't changed""","This was a verrrry funny movie. Most cast members returned, and the ones who didn't(ex. Robert Stack) weren't missed. I was a huge fan of the first film, and was almost disaproving the fact that this wasn't directed or written by the Zucker Abraham Zucker team. But the replacement did fine.Also note that William Shatner's monolaugue was the funniest thing I've heard in a long time."
4,It's a cook book!,"Airplane! is back - only this time on space shuttle! It's a bit of a re-hash of the first Airplane! movie. Still there are plenty of laughs and Captain Kirk himself (William Shatner) guest stars. Almost as funny as the first movie. And remember, keep an eye on the background action as well as for the other Sci-Fi movie references. If you bought the first one then get this too!I knew it was a bad day to switch to decaff... :)"
5,Great For An Overcast Day,"Hysterical movie. If you are down, pop this in the DVD and lift your spirits. Great fun, just like the original!"
2,Not Anywhere Near The Original,"Let me start off by saying I loved the first Airplane and consider it to be the best comedy ever. So I'm not a hater of the genre. When I first saw Airplane about two years ago I laughed until I cried. Just days after seeing it I was in an electronic store and saw Airplane 2 on DVD. Assuming it was made by the guys that made the original I bought it, oh how wrong I was. This is nothing but a sad attempt to copy the success of the original. Paramount asked the Zuckers and Jim Abrahams to do the sequel, when they declined saying there's not enough jokes left to do a sequel Paramount just hired some other guy to do it. The result, Airplane 2 crashes and burns."
4,I am serious,"The first one is better than the sequel, of course, but at this price how could you pass it up? These movies are great!"
4,Great choice for a lover of spoofs,Airplane 2 is a great movie that doesnt butcher the idea of airplane. It has more jokes and even some better spoofs. Highly recommended for lovers of spoofs.
1,Fell Asleep.,"Viewed: 5/05Rate: 25/05: Plainly awful, Airplane II: The Sequel seemed to be a deja-vu of the first movie without anything new to add. The cast was terrible, and even Lloyd Bridges couldn't save the movie. Thinking of the cast, I would like to torture the odious character of Stephen Stucker. On a large scale, the humor was too minuscule at best, trampled by the comparison to the first film. Obviously, there is no story, just a stupid repeat of the same plot used in Airplane!. During the movie, there is a particular scene where Striker narrates his sad story to the lady beside her. She got seasick by the sound of it and proceeded to vomit in a bag. In the end, she got all dried up to the bone. That's exactly how I felt about Airplane II: The Sequel."
4,HIGH-ADVENTURE WITH SUPERIOR SPECIAL EFFECTS!,"Apart from THE CONCORDE - AIRPORT '79, this is my favourite film of the series."
1,More Groans Than Laughs,"Weak, derivative, and thoroughly unfunny - classic example of a studio cashing in with the old Good Movie Rehash. (...). Although what's funny and what isn't is often a matter of opinion, the element of surprise is what defines humor. We laugh when the unexpected happens. But having seen it all before in the original, nothing - and I mean NOTHING - is funny in Airplane 2. Even the new jokes are variations on a theme. Save your money and watch Airplane! twice."
3,Unfortunately Edited,"The DVD release of the classic comedy film has restored many scenes missing from both TV showings and the original VHS release, though at the unprecedented cost of random pieces throughout the movie. While several jokes will be new to those seeing the DVD for the first time (many sexual and drug related), fans of the other formats of the movie will no doubt be scratching their heads as scenes go by without memorable bits.With the trend of jamming every possible thing onto a DVD release, it's baffling that this movie would be released with scenes missing from it. That and the conspicuous lack of special features tarnishes a true great among comedy movies.Disappointing."
2,Deja Vu?,"After seeing this movie, I felt like it was the same movie just with some line and character changes. Both have an old lady who dies listening to Robert Hays, it was funny in the first one but, come on, think of something different. Also, both talk about him escaping from the mental hospital. We know about that already it does not need to be said again, and I could go on and on. I laughed, but not because of this one, because it reminds me of the first one. The original part in this one that made me laugh was the court scene, other than that it is just an experience in deja vu. GRADE: D+"
1,Airplane 2 Crashes,"Sequels are often cheap imitations of the original and more often than not, they're usually pretty bad. And ""Airplane 2: The Sequel"" is no exception. The producers and writers of this lackluster endeavor obviously didn't put a lot of thought or effort into making this film. Much of the material is nothing more than a variation of what was in the original ""Airplane!,"" which makes for a rather dull and predictable movie.In ""Airplane 2,"" the writers do try to vary the plot a bit by changing the venue to the 21st century but this does more harm than good. This futuristic setting has some comic aspects but it never really connects with the audience. There are also some futile attempts at political/ethnic/sexual humor but they too fall flat.This is a second-rate movie that never gets off the ground. Don't waste your money on it."
2,Airplane II,I was looking for AIRPORT and ordered AIRPLANE by mistake.I have since ordered and received AIRPORT that I have enjoyed.
3,"Not as good as the first, but if you liked the first, you may like this one.","The previous entry said that many scenes were delted, that is not true. The fact is that with these two films, there was too much content that was very adult related and therefore deleted scenes were added for the television version to make the film fit the 1 hour 30 min time slot. This DVD is the theatrical release of the film, however, I do bleieve that there are many deleted scenes for both films that were semi-funny and they should have been included. But we all know how sub par films get their DVD treatment....sub par."
4,Simons turned to jelly!!,"Airplane II is just as funny as the first. This time, they're not on a plane, but a lunar shuttle. Elaine has a new boyfriend, Simon (who later turns to jelly), and Ted Striker wants her back.The jokes are similar to the first - which makes it even funnier.Elaine is on the speaker to the passengers telling them the lunar shuttle is off course just ""a tad"" and someone asks what exactly a ""tad"" is, and she replies ""90000000 miles and we're heading straight for the sun!"" which causes chaos... Funny stuff!If you liked airplane, you'll love airplane II.."
2,Airplane2,"Very dissapointed, but then sequels are very seldom better than the origional. I can highly recommend the origional, one of the funniest flying movies everRon Nash"
1,Ouch...Airplane II pains me.,"No audio commentary to find out what the director was thinking...Airplane II is a travesty. Even if the movie hadn't hastily re-staged almost all the same jokes, excluded the presence of Leslie Nielsen, and generally just sucked...it gets major horror points for having, at least on the VHS copy, a short animation after the credits saying ""Coming Next Year from Paramount Pictures: Airplane III!"" Obviously, someone thought it was going to be a hit...they were wrong. I honestly laughed once at this film, at the classic viewscreen gag performed by William Shatner. What a waste of a lot of people's time."
2,Airplane2,This movie is not what I expected. All they did was copy the same jokes from Airplane!. I think that Abraham Zucker&Zucker could have done it better.
5,Brother Ray Charles,ive been a Ray charles fan for many years and this cd is excellentits all about tears but tears is a part of live happy tears and sad tearsany ray charles fans should add this to there collection i give it 5 stars
5,Gergely,Professional album from 1964. A very good selection of tearful songs by one of greatest singer and musician.
5,Great product,This is a great briefcase that looks very well made. We have tried many different types of briefcases throughout the years but hope this one last until retirement.... his first case was a Samsonite and hopefully his last one before retirement!
4,Perfect hard-case,"This fit a 17"" notebook computer, as well as all the cables and chargers, easily...and i had room for other stuff.Keep in mind, it's a little bulky...but if you need a hard-case, you can't go wrong here. This would be perfect for someone who travels, or is outdoors a lot...like a contractor.Sturdy, dependable, and travels well...just like a golden retriever."
2,low quality and heavy,"this thing is way too heavy. the interior quality is bad, full of useless plastic boxes. the overall feel of cheapness."
3,ok,"nothing fancy but does the job, plastic insides not practical for use, like how it won't let you open it when it's upside down."
3,Scratches Easily,"The product arrived on time and in very good condition. No problem with the Seller. The interior is great! However, the outside of this new briefcase scratches WAY too easily. The exterior is made of soft plastic. In less than a month, it looks worse than my old one! (I had a similar Samsonite 6"" Attache briefcase for about 12 years and it never scratched at all; smooth plastic sides - very hard. But, the old one finally cracked around the bottom edge recently. Not bad for 12 years of service, so I decided to go with the same brand again.) For the reasons stated herein, I CANNOT recommend this latest Samsonite briefcase."
4,Durable and practical,"No fluff, but if you want something that holds up it does the job. It will carry a fair amount and allows for easy access to your files."
4,"Works well, but a few design quirks","I bought this to replace a 25-year-old Samsonite 6-inch attache case. The fact that the old one worked so well for so long made me buy this one when the handle finally fell off the old one. The new model is sturdy and works well. However, where my old model included dividers in the upper compartment to form three separate compartments, this model has only one compartment. Also, the new one has two hard plastic compartments on the inside of the upper section for storing pens, etc. and an elastic strap that I use for holding a calculator. I would have preferred that the hard plastic compartments be replaced by straps or something more adaptable. If what you have doesn't fit in those hard compartments, they become useless."
2,shadow magic,Very nice history. Bought it to learn Chinese. So much background noise I couldn't. Hear well. But nice movie. No surprises if watching with children. My grandsons (5&8). Enjoyed.
4,Jim Moore confronts JFK conspiracy theories with facts.,"Compared to lone-assassin books by former Commission staffers David Belin and Gerald Ford, this book is a delight to read. Jim Moore entered the case as a young conspiracy believer himself, and now alerts others to the fact that the conspiracy community has done much to deny the American public evidence of Oswald's sole guilt. Where Moore falters is in his shooting scenario; his ""Final Solution"" doesn't work as well as that in Case Closed, which utilizes some analysis made known after Moore's book appeared. I like Conspiracy of One because it's an enjoyable read that doesn't resort to sensationalism, innuendo and conspiracy hysteria to recollect the tragedy of JFK's death."
3,The way it is.,"I found the book full of facts rather than this conspiracy rubbish Americans seem to thrive on.I got a little sick of the constant slagging off of other so called writers who to me were not even worth a mention. I too went to the sixth floor museum and dragged my Father along who was not interested as he expected a gory conspiracy show. We were glad to see a tasteful show to a great man. I was surprised, as Mr Moore states, just how easy the shot was from the sixth floor. Im sure if you read this book then go and visit Dallas you will leave thinking 'what conspiracy'? I do wonder, with the first bullet that missed, has anyone ever run a metal detector over the bow of the oak tree that blocked Mr Oswalds view?"
2,TIRED OF MOORE'S ACT,"This book does not prove Oswald killed JFK. Moore skips all of Oswald's childhood and activities prior to the assassination. He constantly bashes the critics, to a point where enough is enough. His act is tiring. He does do admirable work with the medical evidence and the zapurder film, but if you are looking for a book that proves Oswald is guilty, buy Case Closed by Gerald Posner, this book proves nothing."
2,"GREAT TALE, BUT A CRIME IT'S SO POORLY TOLD","""It happened before ... it can happen again!"" Or so says the copy on the box. Gee, we hope not. The story of Nicola Sacco and Bartolomeo Vanzaetti -- avowed anarchists who could not prove their whereabouts the day a shoe factory was robbed in South Braintree in which two men were murder and so were charged, tried and convicted -- has inspired (almost) as much copy as Monica and Bill's ""crimes."" Great tale, tepid flick. But we love Joan Baez warbling the title track."
1,Strictly for Seattle radicals (all others need not apply).,"This movie is in black and white (better still, in black and red!) and I don't mean colorwise. It's your standard politically-correct hagiography where good guys ooze beatitude, bad guys reek evil, and if you don't root for the former, you belong with the latter. Like history told this way? If so, then you're gonna love it; if not, at least you'll get some laughs.Mind you, it's not that I object the fake look, dubbed dialogue, hammy overacting or holier-than-thou attitude of everyone concerned in this dated political flick from the sixties; I mean, we were all pretty much ridiculous ourselves back then. But Joan Baez's awful lyrics and worst wailing tear apart the movie's only redeeming asset: Ennio Morricone's beautiful music score. Now that's a true crime!So you've been warned!"
4,Very good read!,I ordered this book for a requirement for a class I was taking. I actually enjoyed the book very much! I would recommend this for anyone concerned with the planet or for just a good read!
1,Afflu-Repetitive,"I had to read this book for summer reading for an AP Gov course. It was a dreadful experience. It was very difficult to force myself to read more than one chapter per sitting because of the book's repetitiveness and dullness. If you actually want to read it, let me save you the time while I summarize it:-Spend more time hiking than working.-Don't get a well paying job, because it will make you miserable and you will undoubtedly go into dept.-take a low paying job, because life will be great. As long as you dont want to buy anything.-Don't buy material goods that make you happy.-Only nature and people make you happy.-Rich people, 90% of the time are littering, stuck-up, scumbags.pack that into 250 pages, and there you go."
3,Another lens through which to view late capitalism,"We have seen and heard these scenarios before, whether couched in historical, sociological, ethical, or religious terms. This particular version of the story is well-researched and there is no particular problem with the thesis. That being said, using the term ""epidemic"" implies -- just as it does with the so-called ""obesity epidemic"" -- that the problem will circulate through the system and then go away. Framing it that way is too optimistic, for the roots run much deeper than the epidemic metaphor suggests. Worth the facts, but create your own schema if you want it to serve as the basis for action."
3,"Lots of stats, but little direction","This book builds a case for identifying a new disease, ""affluenza"", that is apparently sickening American society. The authors cite symptom after symptom of the disease, supported by innumerable facts, which are well-footnoted and indexed. The book is divided into 3 sections: symptoms, causes, and treatment. However, most of the text is actually devoted to describing the problem, and even the treatment section is filled with more facts and very few concrete suggestions for solutions to the problem. As a springboard for discussions, this book with all its facts could be quite interesting. But the endless list of statistics can make the prose rather tiresome if read straight through."
1,A Pointless and meaningless rant,"I dont know how many times I have read this same book: It rehashes the same old stale arguments heard over and over. The material world is bad, spending is bad, consumption is bad... yap yap yappity yap.Nobody denies that there is something wrong with our economy and culture, and we need to fix that, but the boring and unoriginal rant that Simon offers does nothing for our understanding of the dynamics or nature of consumerism.In the end, this book is nothing but a empty status symbol for the kind of consumerist yuppies that Simon seems to abhor. If you want to show people that you are a concerned pseudo-intellectual, who is all concerned about the future of our planet and society, you buy this book and have it lying around your house.What a load of pretentious crap."
5,Changed my life,"I won't bother to repeat the rave reviews, but suffice it to say that this book led me to read others including ""Your Money or Your Life"" and ""Natural Capitalism"". Additionally, I have decided to leave my cushy job in the auto industry to go back to school to study more sustainable and sane means of transportation. I ask many people close to me to take a look at this book; if nothing else, I hope it opens their eyes and makes them more aware of their everyday actions."
3,"Not a ""how-to""","When I bought this book, I was hoping it was a little more ""hands-on"" than it is. It seems more like an Erma Bombeck book than an instruction manual. There are ideas for things to do like outings and stuff, but I wanted more ideas for ways to enjoy your own backyard, almost like a summer camp. This book was more concerned with making life livable for the stay-at-home parent stuck with the kids for the summer. At this stage in my life, I wanted the ""Funfilled Activities for All"" to include me. The whole point of the book seemed to be to make it through the summer and then send the kids back to school, only to wait for the next summer. Not much help."
2,This book is very light...no substance,The good stuff is elsewhere ($ -> Rational) is the basic premise of this book. I would have to say that if you want an introduction to RUP then this is definitely that but no more. Don't expect it to do more than familiarize you with the general concepts of RUP. Almost every chapter ends with which tools you should buy from Rational.
4,A concise well written book,"This is excellent book for software designers who need to learn the UNIFIED PROCESS in reasonable amount of time with getting lost into nitty gritty details like in book ""UNIFIED PROCESS"" by the three amigos"
2,This book is sales literature for Rational.,There are some good ideas in the book. Overall its sales literature. I should be able to download it from Rational's web site. I don't recommend it unless you have full intentions of buying Rational's developer products.
3,Extended product pitch too light on examples to use,I agree completely with the last reviewer. The book is just a teaser for the product (another 700 USD). Very disappointing after waiting for it for so long.
4,Readable,"After starting a few books in this series, this is the one I ended up finishing because of its readability. As an introduction to RUP, this book did its job. My only reservation is that it might be a bit too formal for those unfamiliar with the RUP jargon."
3,This is a dumb book.,I think you guys need to get lives and but out some better books then this one.
2,"All fluff, no substance","It's an introduction, all right. The trouble is, it's such a high level introduction that there's almost no useful information whatsoever. The entire time I was reading, I was waiting for the author to get to the meat, only to discover at the end that there was none. It was like ordering a double cheeseburger, and getting two buns with ketchup and a pickle, and no beef patties.I can only assume that Rational paid the author for his time in the hopes that people, after reading this book, would purchase their entire software suite just to find out what the RUP actually involves.Despite my severe disappointment (and relief that I didn't have to pay for it myself), I can't rate it any lower than two stars. It's well written, and it could quite possibly be useful to managers and other business types who have no idea how software development works. The second star is for Rational's sheer chutzpah in getting a respected publisher to put out a $30 marketing pamphlet for them."
4,BINGO!! Good product for low vision folks!,"I purchased this product for my Mom, so that she could continue to participate in her ladies group at church, when they have their penny bingo night :-)) I bought a few extra, so she can share them with her friends."
5,American Booksellers Association rates Herb tops.,"Each year the ABA (The American Booksellers Association, which is a respected group of independent booksellers) picks out what they feel are the best books of the season and prints the list in their weekly publication, ""Bookselling This Week."" Cooking With Herb, The Vegetarian Dragon - A Cookbook For Kids (we're pleased to announce,) was right near the top of their list of the best picture books for children. As the publisher (Barefoot Books) we're very proud of that."
4,A Good Read,"This is a real world detective story without the theatrics usually associated with this type of story line. A quick read, recommend for a coast to coast flight. It is uplifting to see law enforcement officers succeed in bringing white collar criminals to justice."
3,A few comments..,"Since other reviewer has already given synopsis, I will be very brief. This story really had potential but just did not live up to the ""Harlequin Temptation"" line. It's just not naughty enough. Anna giving Cole the brush-off became redundant. Cole's secret though revealed he never solved the companys problem-Anna makes a suggestion instead. Not major stuff but this story fits more into the Harlequin Romance line instead of Temptation."
3,The Sad tale of a prisoner,"This is adapted from a book written in the 1800's. It was considered a strong novel about the bad state of prisons. It is about a prisoner who is innocent, but his whole life, is accoused of killing another person. The film seems less severe than the book. As more sad things happen in the book. So get your hankey's out, it's a tear-jerker..."
5,Great Book!,I appreciated the hands on positive examples this book offered. It gave me new hope in becoming friends with my teens and raising them with a positive attitude.
4,Weddings Haven't Changed Much,"Spencer Tracy is the whole show in this story of a man who faces the ordeal of his daughter's wedding, an affair that grows to be much more than he ever expected it to be. Caterers, clothes, decorations, guest lists, and especially an escalating cost give him endless headaches, not to mention the fact he will be losing his only daughter. Tracy is excellent in a role that moves between being the voice of reason to being the voice that stirs up more trouble. He's very funny and his natural acting style makes him the perfect everyman / typical father. Joan Bennett stars as his wife, in her glory planning the wedding she never had, and she's very good. An incredibly beautiful Elizabeth Taylor is the bride, and it seems very ironic watching her in a movie about weddings! The humour is real since it is based in human nature, and so many of Tracy's frustrations over the wedding are still valid today. It's a very good film."
5,Love this movie!,I love that I can find the older movies here at Amazon. I have bought several from different sellers and all have been great! I just love Spenser Tracy and this old b&w is one of my FAV's
5,FATHER OF THE BRIDE,THIS IS THE ORIGINAL VERSION. VERY GOOD. ALL THE SITUATIONS THAT GEORGE BROOKS FACES ARE RELATABLE TO EVERY FATHER WHO HAS A DAUGHTRE GETTING MARRIED.
1,Wrong item!!!!,I ordered this movie excited that I would get to see the original version of one of my favorite movies and when I opened the package it was the 1991 version which I already own! I was very upset and I will NEVER order from them again!
4,Spence steals the show,"First, a warning: this is the colorized version of this classic black and white film, so avoid it if you're a film connoisseur. The original black and white version is infinitely superior to this poorly done colorization.Now, the good news. This film showcases Spencer Tracy's remarkable acting ability and he delivers a witty and intelligent performance as Elizabeth Taylor's long-suffering father. Spence has several monologues which are a joy to watch. His acting gift (along with Charles Laughton) is an absolute wonder and it's always a pleasure to watch him. Joan Bennet is adequate in a supporting role and Elizabeth Taylor is breathtaking as the 18-year-old soon to be wed daughter. Liz's performance is actually quite good and her interplay with Tracy is especially effective.Yes, this movie is dated in places, but Tracy's performance is worth watching the entire movie. He is in nearly every scene and transforms a seemingly average movie into something really special."
5,"That's Joan Bennett, not Katharine Hepburn.","FATHER OF THE BRIDE is not a Tracy-Hepburn film. That is Spencer Tracy, giving another peerless performance in the title role. But that's Joan Bennett, perfectly cast as his wife, making a brilliant transition here to mother roles from the femme fatales she played in classic Fritz Lang film noir films of the forties. The bride, of course, is lovely Elizabeth Taylor. They're all first rate in this top notch Vincente Minnelli comedy."
4,Father of the Bride,"This is an enjoyable movie with strong performances by Spenser Tracey and a young Elizabeth Taylor. The movie is in clear black and white film, the sound is clear,and the packaging is attractive and easy to open."
4,Not We Expected,"We purchased this for our daughter who is getting married in May for Christmas. We had seen the movie a number of years before and loved the storyline--seeing many of the anxieties that they encountered then, now coming to pass as we plan her wedding. The movie was advertized as a colorized version of the original and had mixed reviews by some ""purists"" who don't like colorization. We actually were looking forward to seeing it in ""color"" as we had only watched it in black and white. However, when we came to view the movie over Christmas it turned out to be in black and white. It still was a delightful film with wonderful actors/actresses and a very clear version, just not what we had expected to get. Still worth watching!"
1,Utterly charmless.,"Surely this marks the end of Madonna's movie ""career"".To be quite honest it's not entirely her fault.The Next Best Thing is victim to flat direction and an awful script.Is this really the same John Schlesinger who made a film called Midnight Cowboy over thirty years ago?..."
1,"Not Just ""Borderline"" Terrible--It Is Terrible!","Thank your ""Lucky Star"" if you miss this one. This movie is so bad I don't know where to start. I don't like Madonna to begin with. It's bad enough that I have to hear her belt out her crappy pop ditties on the radio and see her face plastered on magazine covers, but this so-called ""movie"" is quite possibly the worst thing she's unleashed on the public. It's even worse than ""Body of Evidence"" and that's saying something. Maybe I'm prejudiced against Madonna, but I was willing to give this movie a chance...boy, do I regret it. I want my two hours back."
4,Give Madonna a break,"Okay, so she's no Meryl Streep but Madonna is not a bad actress! This film proves it. She does a fine job as does the rest of the cast. But, she isn't the centerpiece of the movie, so I really don't see why all the slings and arrows from critics are about her acting. The movie does a good job provoking thought about the issues it explores: what is the definition of a ""family"" in our society today, should a convention family be the mold we all follow, should a gay man have as much parental rights as a straight man etc. There's a good blend of comedy and drama. The movie is no ""Titanic"" but it's still good entertainment, a nice diversion. Fun in the beginning, sad towards the climax, touching by the end. Immitates real life quite a bit. It should fare much better on video."
1,Wished for more....,"I had high expectations for this movie and anticipated what I should expect with controversial storyline and the incredible cast. However, it saddens me that the movie lacked realism and honesty. Being a huge Madonna fan, I really was hoping for more, but her performance felt forced and lacked sincerity. I felt most of the performaces individually were outstanding, but with Madonna's ""acting"" the film just didn't work. I do encourage you to see it, explore it, and make your own opinions, but that is mine and I'm staying woth it."
2,Patronising,"This movie treats gays like preteens keen on, but too afraid to have sex with women. It reeks with anti-gay stereotypes without even being funny. It could be described as Madonna's ego trip delusion that all gay men are hot for her."
1,Madonna is an embarrassment...,"This movie is So very bad on so many different levels, that it is almost beneath any serious movie lover or critic to waste time viewing it. Madonna is at her all time low, and it is a low that few stars ever reach. She is a terribly bad actress and this time out, she made even her die-hard fans cringe in embarassment for her. Simply put, there is no guesswork here...there is not a redeaming quality in this movie. The acting, script, direction, tone, pace, etc., are all at an extremely shoddy level, and DAMN is she getting painful to look at. The only comfort comes in the knowledge of the FACT that this movie was completely shunned by not only critics but by the public as well. Even Madonna's legion of fans couldn't get her out of this one. It bombed on every level."
1,The Next Best Thing,The product came quite quickly but unfortunately I'm unable to watch it because it says it's from a different region.
1,hate this movie...,"i don't like this movie at all. the plot is just dumb and really bad. the soundtrack is good though. i can't say that madonna is one of the best actress out there but she has a few, good decent films. if you're a fan, just skip this one."
2,Could have been better,"This movie is mediocre. It's worth watching one time. Madonna actually gives a good performance in this movie, and so does Rupert Everette. This movie could have been really good if it hadn't been pulled into so many directions. This movie is never sure of what direction it wants to go in. The plot twist towards the end of the movie is completely ridiculous. Sam should have been Robert's biological son. The movie was trying to portray unconventional families, but when it's revealed that Sam is not Robert's son, it destroys the whole concept of the movie. The dialog was so horrible. Nobody heaps a bunch of compliments on someone when they are breaking up with them, and the dialog in the courtroom scene is so unrealistic that it's funny. Madonna is not to blame for this movie being a bomb. The script and dialog is why this movie is ignored and mediocre."
2,MADONNA PUSHING A GROCERY CART? RIIIIGGGHHHT!,I SAW THIS MOVIE ON MY WAY FROM SEATTLE TO TOKYO AND I WAS APALLED TO SEE TWO OF MY FAVORITE STARS LOOKING LIKE EVERYDAY PEOPLE. HODGE PODGE! THE STORY IS A GOOD STORY AND I LOVE THE WAY THIS MOVIE REFLECTS ON HOW HARD IT REALLY IS TO FIND SOMEONE YOU WANT TO FALL IN LOVE WITH BUT RUPERT AND MADONNA DON'T BELONG HERE. IT'S JUST NOT BELIEVABLE. THE ENDING NEEDED A LOT MORE AS WELL. A LOT MORE! I WOULD PUT SOMETHING IN FOR THE DVD BUT I HAVEN'T VIEWED IT AND I DON'T REALLY HAVE A DESIRE TO SINCE THIS MOVIE IS JUST BASIC HOLLYWOOD MUMBO JUMBO STARRING BIG NAMES.
3,"Good Start, Bad Finish","I loved the first pasrt of this movie. The story was great, and it was funny. But most of the middle and all of the ending was not so great. Their first mistake was skipping 6 years. But even then the movie wasn't that bad. But I would say by the time they bring Madonna's straight soon-to-be husband lover into the story, the movie was compleately crushed. Another mistake they mader was casting a 9 year old acter for a 6 year old role. I think over all, the movie hyanked all these emotions out of you for nothing. I recomend the first half, but not the second. Even though you will probablly want to watch the depressing second half as well once you're intro the movie."
5,THIS IS THE BEST MADONNA VIDEO!!1,THE STORY IS WELL-WRITTEN. ABBY(MADONNA) IS A YOGA TEACHER AND ROBERT(RUPERT EVERETT)IS A LANDSCAPER AND IS GAY. ONE NIGHT THEY HAVE A WILD ROMP AND THE NEXT THING YOU KNOW ABBY IS CARRYING A BABY. THEN IT GETS CONFUSING. ROBERT AND ABBY DO NOT GET MARRIED BUT LIVE TOGETHER AND RAISE THE CHID AS TOGETHER. ABBY THEN DATES A INVESTMENT BANKER(BENJAMIN BRATT). THEY WANT TO GET MARRIED AND TAKE CUSTODY OF THE CHID AND ENDS UP IN A UGLY COURT CASE.
4,The sweetest movie ever,"I have a lot of gay friends and the way they love me make me think how lovely could be having a baby with them, of course skipping the sex part because it would be unavoidable feel the awkwardness no matter if we were drunk or not.I've always said that having a gay friend is like having a 2 x 1 because they can act like a girlfriend and they still have that male part inside of them so they can see the whole picture and open your eyes if necessary.I think I wanna live Abby's life, have a Robert being the real father of my baby because is the best father ever!!!I really love this movie"
2,Really just so-so,"I've watched this movie twice, and I am not sure I will watch it again.First of all, I'm one who had never had anything bad to say about Madonna's acting, but here she's really bad. She gets better and the movie progresses, it's almost distracting, because she's supposed to be the center of the attention.Rupert Everett is fine, he looks dashing of course, like Benjamin Bratt.But then, the movie itself is really badly done. They had the locations, the sets, and yet it's just not at all good and almost boring at times, not to mention the familiar places we've been at before and the really annoying court scenes. Just how many times do we have to see attorneys trashing innocent people?Honestly, there is nothing new in this movie to make it worth watching more than once to convince yourself how not good it is."
3,3 stars but only for Madonna and she is lucky she gets these,"First off, movie goers hated it. The Box Office says it all. Second, what kind of movie is this? As a comedy, it fails. As a drama IT FAILS BIG TIME! This could be Everett's fault, Do NOT let actors run your film. Anyway have you heard Madonna's hot new song? It is Great, ironically it's called Music and thats what she should stick to. I guess it would do no good to some but I honestly love Madonna and she has been good in some films, check out Dangerous Game."
3,Enjoyable and interesting film,"I don't quite understand why this film has received such negative reviews. I went to see it, with the fear of God having been injected into me. However, what I discovered was a very enjoyable and thought-provoking film about problems faced in the world today. Madonna and Rupert Everett did a good job, although, I have to ask - what is with Madonna's accent? Anyway, a good film which I'll buy.."
2,not that bad,from the way people we talking about this i thought it would be awful. it was not all that bad though.maddonna my not be the world best actress but thr other actors are good. i think the kid who played sam was pretty good. overall i thought it was to slow moving .
1,Tragic.....,"The best that can be said is that this movie kept me watching...I kept waiting for Madonna to 1) figure out where her accent was coming from and 2) let go of the stiff, tense, and downright atrocious acting. Look, I'm not anti-Madonna. In fact, I wanted to like this movie and I still applaud the theory of a ""family movie with a twist"". However, this movie was truly horrid. The acting was so appauling I cringed everytime a laugh was expected. If you are interested in a dumbfounding waste of time, watch ""The Next Best Thing."" Side note: I'm horrified that this was the same director who brought us ""Midnight Cowboy""!!"
2,NOT WHAT I ANTICIPATED!,"I agree with everyone that gave this movie 1 or 2 stars. This wasn't Madonna's best movie. It had poor acting, bad script, and much more. This is definitely a renter not a buyer!"
2,Madonna Deserves Much Much Better,"The main problem with ""The Next Best Thing"" is that the movie is very flat and some parts leave you thinking ""what?"". The acting was terrific but I didn't feel that Madonna's character and Rupert's character were best friends at all, in fact Madonna's character was extremely underdeveloped. Her not allowing Rupert to see the boy came out of nowhere, and was totally stupid. Madonna is a good actress but this movie won't help that aspect of her career at all. ""The Next Best Thing"" is bogged down in melodramatic nosense that hides it potential to really make an important statement about the changing reality of families. And the ending! I was so mad-I thought ""This is totally twisted-it is too stupid!"". If you want to see a good Madonna movie, skip ""The Next Best Thing"" and grab ""Evita""."
1,The next best thing to tonsilectomy!,"I just had my tonsils taken out, and that was the most painful experience of my life. Watching this movie was a close second.Madonna has got to be the worst actress to get on a movie screen. Her inability to express any emotion is uncanny. Rupert is no better. Just because someone speaks with an English accent, that doesn't make him a good actor (as some reviewers tend to think). He literally competes with Madonna throughout the entire movie to see who will put the least effort and emotion in a scene. At least Madonna has got her music to fall back on. The plot is so silly that it doesn't even deserve a mention. The dramatic turn, half way through the movie, only makes the actors more uncomfortable, becoming even more unconvincing.Please, Madonna, stick to your music. We love your albums, but your movies stink!"
2,Disturbing,"Am I the only one who was completely disturbed by the Madonna's character disgraceful deception? (Don't want to ruin it for the unwashed, but trust me, it doesn't matter.) To add insult to injury, we are subjected the the constant references to Madonna's beauty, considering that she looks well past 40 and tired thoughout the entire movie. We are treated to Madonna's moments of flexibility as a Yoga instructor. Be warned, Madonna is now sporting a British accent. The only bright light is Benjamin Bratt, who has absolutly nothing to work with. My suggestion is to gather some good friends and view it for the numerous yuks."
1,is it a surprise that Madonna ruined a film?,Just god awful!!!! Madonna cannot act worth anything!!!! She can barely make decent albums now much less act. You know Rubert only did this as a favor!!! Please!!!!!! Just sad!!!! Not even worth buying if it were 99 cents.
1,Christian fiction should be written by Christians,"Steeple Hill is a Christian publisher. People who purchase their products are generally Christians looking to be entertained by fiction written by other Christians. Now, from church to church there can be differing interpretations of the Bible, but if someone just out and out does not believe what it says about things generally accepted by most Christian churches, then they may not be a Christian.[...]Clearly this is a case of tares in the wheat."
3,Funny but...,I would have liked to know that the book would be so Christian. I didn't realize it until I started reading it that there would be so many parts of it talking about God. Not being a Christian that kinda got tiresome for me but I did enjoy the book and the characters.
4,Fun Read!,"I am falling in love with ""Steeple Hill Cafe!!!"" This is just one of the books by this publisher that I have enjoyed reading as a Christian SAHM.I applaud Meredith in her ability to portray different mothering styles. I laughed out loud at many of what these moms thought they were doing ""right""! Many topics hit close to home, especially humility....yeah! gotta keep working on that one!I also admire Meredith for completing this work. I too am a homeschooling mom and adoptive mom, and don't know how she has done it....Thanks!!!"
5,engaging,"I purchased this book as part of my homeschool health curriculum, but I found that I didn't even have to assign chapters out of it. The kids would just pick it up and read it at will. The writing style is engaging for teens, the subject matter relevant, the theme positive. The kids themselves started initiating changes in their food choices after reading it."
3,Missed it by that much,"I liked this book overall, and it was interesting to see the changes and deletions between te script and the finished film. The big problem I had was the omission of the ending scene in the screenplay, it just seems like a cop out to protect a secret that was already out at the time of the book's release A WEEK AFTER THE MOVIE CAME OUT. I wanted this book in hardback but for somereason it never came available, and I ended up settling for the paperback version. I have a feeling the Cinefex magazine covering Planet of the Apes will be much more informative for a lot less money."
2,Disappointed,"I was anxiously awaiting the arrival of this book as I facilitate marriage preparation workshops. ... I would agree that there are several pertinent questions asked, however many of the questions seem like they are 'space fillers'. This along with a lot of spacing and extremely large font look like an unfortunate attempt to make a 'book' ... out of something that could be written on 1-2 sheets of paper. Please don't get me wrong, I strongly believe in couples preparing for their engagements and marriages, and I believe that couples should talk about many of the subjects listed in this book, I just don't personally and professionally feel that this book is worth the money. There are many other relationship oriented books that would provide better guidance for couples as they get to know one another and prepare for their upcoming marriages."
4,If you plan on getting married get this book!,Listen I have been waiting for a book like this for a long time now. It's really quite simple and the title is self explanatory. I actually got a copy of it a few months ago when the authors sent it to our company for review. It has been a real charm for me. I enjoyed reading all of the questions they came up with in this book. I had a lot more fun answering them on the questionnaire I ordered and I keep it on hand for my future dates.Thumbs up you guys you have a winner.
4,Harambee,"After forty years of existence, Kwanzaa has shown that is not diaphanous holiday, but a bastion that has stood the test of time. More importantly, the author reinforces this fact in this small book and extends the purview of the holiday- Kwanzaa should be celebrated throughout the year. Moreover, I agree with this assertion-I use Kwanzaa year around to remind me of the principles that are guiding my life. More importantly, the author provides practical exercises that can help mollify your day. For example, the Susu activity from Nigeria is very interesting; read the chapter on Ujamaa to find out more about it."
4,"A ""good read"". Interesting plot. Vivid characters.",A very good book from a brand new author. Interesting and different plot line. Vivid characters; especially Max. Look forward to reading more of this author's writing.
5,Wonderful perspective shift!,"After reading the Ophelia books and the studies on the many and varied problems teenage girls face, this was a wonderful and refreshing perspective. Teenage girls who are self-confidant, not worried about pleasing others with who they are, eloquent, etc. How encouraging! I'm looking forward to reaping some of these benefits of homeschooling..."
3,It is what it is.,In the discription says there shows are bad and they never make there mortgage payments G I Wonder why i guse youl have to rent it to find out oh the sex isnt real its all simulated they act it out thow but no real incertion or nudity the used condoms dont even look used. It is what it is i gave this movie three stars because the movie stays true to its discription there shows are bad and they never make mortgage i read that and i still baught it.
2,???,"Don't even remember watching it, could not have been very good! Whoever created this should find another career. Best of luck!"
3,Sounds a lot like a slot machine,"This toy sounds a lot like a slot machine when the letters and numbers light up. My daughter likes to carry it around, and listen to the songs, like Bill Bailey, La Cucaracha, but the slot machine sound is kind of annoying after a while."
1,Ways of a charlatan.,"This book is so poorly written that I would not even want to give it away. It is composed of scraps about unassociated subjects all the way to Islam, with no cohesive reasoning. A definite throw-away!"
1,"HORRIBLE, WASTE OF TIME!",This book is one of the worst books I've ever read. None of the research from the Bible is even remotely close to the context it was written in. Can Katz even do a reasonable job at researching information? It doesn't even deserve one star.
2,These guys are losers...,"I bought this book hoping it could help explain why my boyfriend, after 3 years, decided that he simply was ""unhappy"" and wanted to break up.I enjoyed some of Dr. Shoshanna's other insights into communication but this book was way off for me. It seems like she took the extreme case scenarios when most of the time things and reasons are way more subtle. I could not relate my situation to any of the men or women in the book and if a lot of people can, then that is trully sad.I was with a man that was genuinly a great person and treated me well, always good to me, but had his own self esteem issues which permeated into the relationship. He had a difficult past and bad relationships that left him scared and i think unable to really commit for fear.Anyhow if your guy did you wrong, if you had a emotionally abusive relationship or if you were playing mind games with eachother this book is for you! Otherwise you may need insights from a more subtle observationist"
2,Women leave for all the same reasons,"I wasn't looking for a book on why men leave... but on the fear of commitment. I have enjoyed this author's other book about Zen and falling in love... and browsing the first pages intrigued me.I will never understand why anyone thinks this is just a masculine problem. I think that certain people, for whatever reason, value their own personal freedom above anything else, yet everyone, of course, would like to have a loving partner to go through life with. I wish this book had more insight into how TWO people like this, male, female... whatever... can find freedom within the confines of relationship."
1,Why do women leave is the real question!,"This book is clearly about the wrong subject and is misleading in its very concept. According to the book : THe 91% Factor, women initiate or are the plaintiff in 91% of divorce cases. By talking about why men leave when they really don't is to lead women to anticiapte something that probably will not happen. She is much better of preparing for what is extremely likely to happen rather than what is unlikely to happen."
4,Fun,"I'm old school- so I couldn't pass on the opportunity to play a few games from the 80's. Unfortunately, there are only a handful of games that I actually play, but they are playable and replayable for hours at a time!"
1,D Nealian Handwriting,This new book arrived on time. My only problem was that I had to pay full retail price.
1,Awful!,"I had to keep checking the front page to make sure this terrible book was by one of my favorite authors, Diana Palmer. Every character in this novel was one-dimensional, and the book was so dialogue heavy. It never SHOWED me what the characters were feeling, but only what they were saying. I love Diana Palmer but this book was such a dissapointment. I wanted to love it, but I did not care about whether the characters got together or whether they lived or died. This was one of the worst books I've ever read. The only reason I finished it was to be fair to one of my favorite authors. Pass on this one; it's a waste of time. Try Palmer's Lacy."
5,Case of the Missing Secretary,Loved the book but then I love everything written by Diana Palmer!! Bought over 70 books for my Kindle in the last 3 months.
5,Tingling Shampoo,"My grandpa (87) was looking for some shampoo that would help with his dandruff, and he had noticed that at the barber shop they washed his hair with something that was tingly.I immediately recognized that it was tea tree and bought him a year's supply of shampoo. He loves it and says that it fixes his dandruff issue."
3,"The Rachmoninov is precise, but ""Pictures"" doesn't make it.","The Rachmoninov portion of this disc is fantastic, and definitely worth having. It shows the polish of Richter's later years (it was recorded in live in 1984) but still has the underlying aggressiveness that makes Richter a marvel to hear.The ""Pictures"" rendition has its moments, definitely, but I was disappointed overall. First, the recording, which was made at a live performance in 1956, is somewhat flawed (numerous pops, and some hiss is present), and is of course mono. Richter plays with his trademark abandon, and it is a virtuoso performance. Unfortunately, there are a few times when the artist loses his rythm, and even strikes a wrong note or two, and this may lessen the enjoyment for some listeners.I nevertheless remain a strong Richter fan, and if you are a die-hard ""Pictures"" and/or Rachmoninov fan (such as myself), this disc is still worth having."
1,Where's Miss Saunders?,"Somebody stretched a description of this item, because if Jennifer Saunders is in it, it's just her voice, or maybe the roof of her house. I don't know. From the title it is not too far to imagine Jennifer Saunders in that big space suit. Anyway I bought it, did not have the time to see it all just to find Miss S., and I think I just threw it away."
4,A (Rare) Middle of the Road Position on Spiritual Gifts,"I recently read several books on the gifts of the Spirit, in preparation for an adult Bible class I was asked to teach. I intentionally included both very conservative and very Charismatic texts, in order to be able to present the range of opinion on the subject. Brian Carraway's book is the delightful exception that takes a moderate, well-argued centrist position. Well worth reading for anyone interested in learning about spiritual gifts (hint: that should be all Christians)."
5,Insightful and Encouraging!,"Spiritual Gifts is the first book I have read that deals specifically and exclusively with the many gifts of the Holy Spirit. Although I have been a Christian for many years, I never sat under extensive teaching on the Gifts of the Spirit. Mr. Carraway's book not only describes spiritual gifts in detail but it also explains the importance of determining what one's own gifts are. You turn the last page feeling not like you have just snacked on a superficial read but that you have really eaten a full spiritual meal.After reading the book and working through the questions at the end, I believe I have a better understanding of the gifts God has given me and how I can use them. Moreover, the book encouraged me to dig even more deeply into God's specific purpose for the gifts He has given me through His Holy Spirit.This is definitely a book that is well worth reading!"
