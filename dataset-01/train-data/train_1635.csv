2,A lot too country for us!,"We love Jimmy Buffet and went to his concert this summer! However, this is way too heavy on the country music side for both my husband and me. We gave it to our thirty something old son who is a country fan, but not usually a Jimmy Buffet fan. Have not yet gotten his feedback yet. If you are a country fan this is the Buffet CD for you; if not, skip purchasing it!"
1,Why?,After a listen you'll be hounded by the same nagging question of Why.Why does this guy still get to put out records? Why do people still listen? Why did I bother listening? Why does Buffett suck so badly? Why am I so nausious? Why can't I make the pain in my head go away?Do you get what I'm saying?
1,"Good music, but profanity","I bought this CD the 1st day it was released. Really liked the first 2 cuts, but the third song does have profanity. What a disappointment, as I like Buffet. Wal-Mart, to its credit, allowed me to return the CD. Its a shame (and so unnecessary) that he had to resort to mis-using the Lord's name."
5,I don't get tired of it!,"A departure; yes. It's a great collection of music that I've never gotten tired-of. IMO, one of his best in years!"
3,Fun but not fabulous,"Not the best from Jimmy. It's fun, but it isn't that ""brings a smile to your face"" music we're so used to from him. He moves a lot more toward the country than he does pull the country to him. And, maybe that was his intention. It just didn't really appeal to me as much. I'm sure as the newness wears off I'll find myself listening to my other Buffett CDs a lot more often that this one. Still, worth the purchase."
5,A GREAT ALBUM FROM A MASTER SINGER/SONGWRITER!,"Jimmy Buffett's ""License to Chill"" is a great album that is among his best works. Featuring a clever mix of Caribbean and Country, along with several duets with some of the greats of country music, this album will please both fans and non-fans alike! All the songs are standouts (This album doesn't have a single song that one wishes to skip over). If you enjoy Buffett's music, or country music in general, then you'll definitely want to pick up ""License to Chill!""Grade: A+"
4,reward yourself,More listenable than some of his recent work. Country roots show and the enjoyment sounds real. Great guests. I didn't turn it off for two days.
5,"Watch an artist mature, not just grow older","I have been a JB fan for years, but admit I lost track of him in the late 90's. When I reconnected with ""Off to see The Lizard"" I was amazed at the difference in his style, and he just keeps getting better with age. This is one artist that makes you feel like you know him, who lets you in to his heart and soul, and lets you age with him like a good friend."
4,good cd,"License to Chill is a great cd. I have been a longtime buffett fan. I have about 20 of his cds. This is NOT a 5 star, because of the country flair to it. If you like country the slightest bit however, this is THE cd to get. Still after work nothing sounds greater than ""License to Chill"""
2,Least Fav. Buffett CD,"Everyone has their ""bad CD"", and in MY opinion, this CD is just too twangy and country. I love you Jimmy, but I bought this CD and was not too impressed, so I traded it in for another CD. :( But I have friends who really like this CD, so it is really hit or miss."
2,license to chill,a couple of the songs are dynamite but the balance of them are very average..I expected better
1,Wasting Away in Hooterville,"I feel like a kid who waits all year for Christmas to receive that special toy and then opens the beautifully wrapped package on Christmas morning to find socks and underwear. I am a diehard Parrothead, but even accompanied by Jimmy's dulcet tones, I can't handle the twangy guitar and country crooning. I will hope this CD is just an aberration, and wait again for an island Christmas gift...still love ya Jimmy but I gave away this CD."
1,NO DOUBT WILL WIN THE CMA NEW RELEASE OF THE YEAR AWARD 2004,"I have listened to Jimmy Buffett since the late 70's, and am a true ""PARROTHEAD"" I have no doubt this CD will take many awards at the annual CMA awards, and anyone truly fond of country music will truly enjoy it.The lyrics are Buffett style, songs of thought, humor, life and those situations that cause us all to think. But message clarity is gone as they get lost in the twang and slang of the country slide and those ""famous"" artist that seem to need to hit notes that distort the words altogether.It appears to me, and I hope I am wrong, that Mr Buffett has set a new course for his horizion in his music, he's gone country. This is one ""parrothead"" that feels left behind.PLEASE JIMMY SAY IT ISN'T SO!!"
2,"Not his worst, but definitely not his best.","There's no middle ground here. You'll either love it or hate it.Astoundingly inconsistent. ""Coast of Carolina"" and his remake of Leon Russell's ""Back to the Island"" are probably the best tracks on this disc. The duet with Alan Jackson, ""Boats to Build,"" is just dreadful. I barely recognized the song. Jerry Jeff Walker's version is much better.And what is up with the chintzy cardboard packaging? Jimmy couldn't spring for a jewelcase?"
4,an excellent work,"Only four stars because the second half of the book is a collection of some pretty old and well known thinking tools: mind mapping, fishbone diagrams, etc. a check on the 3m website will tell you almost as much. The first half concentrates on the problems in business and how the thinking tools can assist. well worth the read if you're not familiar with the above mentioned approaches."
3,I wouldn't purchase again,Overall my feelings about this purchase? . . . Meh! It's okay. Super cheesy and low-budget but I like it. There's a lot of dead time and it's not necessarily structured like a workout video in terms of doing it real time. I wouldn't purchase it again. I would just look up you tube videos for free and then do my own workout. Oh well. She is VERY flexible.
5,Disneyland Frontierland Source Music,"Much of the source background music loop from the Disney Parks Frontierland area come from this CD.Most of the rest from the CD by the same artist called ""Happy Trails"".This loop is used both in Paris and the USA.Recommended for all Disneyland music fans."
1,super horrible !! DO NOT BUY !,"so i received my fridge from amazon, had to return it the next day due to 'funny' noises. received another within 2 days. still the same thing ! i thought i was buying a fridge, NOT A DARN WAVE MACHINE !!!! fridges make a vibrating noise, i understand that. but this machine was making the vibration noise AND a 'whooshing' sound on a constant basis. one of the worst products ive ever experienced with. waste of my time. i would not recommend anyone buy this !!! but if youre looking for a fridge that doesnt even cool your beverages and a wave machine in one, then this is for you. i dont even want to RATE this item, but looks like i have to. NO STARS !!! amazon making me rate the item, so i gave it one star when i believe that there shouldnt be any. please listen to me and DO NOT BUY!"
3,Won't buy this brand again,"This unit was OK for a while, then started making noise and eventually died before it was even 4 years old. OK if you want something cheap for the short haul."
4,Great grill/griddle,"Bought this as a Christmas gift for my wife. She loves it! It seems to cook food very evenly and is fairly easy to clean (a little hard to fit in the sink, but everything comes off with a little soaking and a soft scrub sponge). I've noticed that the griddle side has dark marks from our gas burners, but I don't think it will affect the cooking or cleaning. More than anything, I'm happy because my wife's happy!"
1,Everything sticks to it really badly,"I used this once on the grill side, and it was supposed to be non-stick, but the food I cooked charred onto it really badly and now it's completely unusable. Do yourself a favor and look elsewhere. $50 is a lot to spend for something that's gonna break after one use."
1,Not worth it!,I was excited about buying this Griddle. Unfortunately after two months of use the non-stick surface started breaking down. I was careful about never having the burners past about a 1/3 and I was careful about how I washed it. Chef's design was willing to look at it to see if they would replace it under warranty but i had to pay for shipping which for this product was about $26. And there was no guarantee that they would send me a new one. I've had other griddles that we abused and lasted five years. Going with something else this time.
3,Grill me them burgers!,"I enjoyed the griddle part of this...have made several breakfasts since purchasing this product however, the grill side..is another story....I grilled some onions along with a few burgers a week after i purchased this item and maybe i didnt place enough oil or spray but the onions totally got stuck and burned...i left the grill unwashed over night and now its all clumped on...i need some Brillo pads...with these kind of products, one needs to wash them off right away or it's in the trashcan time.But overall I am content...so far."
4,one of my best purchase,start using it the next too cook some hamburger on thegrill side of it cook tasted better frying it in frying pan
2,Everything sticks,"Maybe I got a reject? I have cooked my share of eggs over the years. On my first egg-scapade with this griddle, they stuck. Eggs? Stick on a nonstick? With cooking spray applied? You've got to be kidding me. I can't make anything on this griddle without it sticking. Salmon last night? The skin was pulled right off and I still can't manage to remove it after sitting in water for an entire day and being scrubbed multiple times. Anybody want to buy mine on the cheap? It's basically worthless aside from being great at thawing foods."
2,Electric stove? Try this other griddle model.,"For those who have electric stoves, check out the Dbl Burner Reversible Grill/Griddle, item 3535, also available on this website. It is from the same company and can be used on high heat over electric burners. I have had mine for over 8 years and love it. It is easy to clean up."
5,Her best since her first album,Afrodiasiac is a good cd. Probably one of the best of 04 so far.This is her best since her first album which is her best in my opinion. This is a must have to all the people readin this. I'm not gonna write a track by track breakdown cause I have a LIFE.Gwan and support her tho.
4,Winner!,"This Cd is great. Brandy really works the hooks on this CD while Timberland works the beats. The title cut is funky and Brandy is totally believable when singing the sad songs especially ""I Tried"". I'm a 40 year old white guy - if she's speaking to me then you know the girl's got chops!Keep it up Brandy!"
5,Nice work Brandy!!!,"I think that this is a pretty good cd...Brandy has always been a great artist, she just needed the right production team to work with and in my opinion she hasn't been marketed well. She is very talented. You can definitely tell she has matured a whole lot, and yes sometimes it takes us all to go through something to be able to tell a story..and if that's what it takes, then GO BRANDY!!!!! The cd opens up with a great song called ""WHO I AM"".......check it out"
5,Great Summer Album,"I was pleasantly surprised by this album. I have to admit I was more of an Moesha fan than of Brandy's music. However, I have to admit this ablum is actually good. I listened to the first 10 songs without actually skipping to the next one half way though. I think Brandy has grown as an artist. It seems hooking up with Timberland and Kayne was a great idea.This album is something you can listen to on a long commute home from work. Or on a Friday night when you getting ready to hang out. GREAT JOB BRANDY."
2,Doesn't Anyone SING Anymore?,"I am not busting on brandy per se, but from what i've heard...i hear more music and technology then i do her voice...sad thing is...that's today's music...i wouldn't buy this because it sounds to much like everything else on the radio these days...i mean if that's your thing, then by all means...pick it up...you'll probably like it...i'm not saying that it's terrible, i guess it's good for what it is...i want to hear more vocals and less of the technology behind making the music...i mean it seems so computerized and less personal to ME... just my two cents...have a happy day!"
2,Very Disappointed,"Uncreative, bland, cliched left to right, frustratingly repetitive, lame, and boring. I'm glad Brandy has found herself and has grown up and all, but this album is by far her worst and least appealing. If you're like me, a CD is an immediate hit to your ear, or it grows on you. This CD did neither. Her current singles are by no means hits. I can't believe T.I. agreed to do such a lame track with her. All and all, I listened to three songs in their entirety. I definitely regret buying this album."
2,Brandys Time is Up,"I've always enjoyed Brandys music. The Boy is Mine, Have I Ever, What About Us?, and Full Moon were all favorite songs of mine of the past 5 years. Therefore, I was excited to get Brandys latest cd Afrodisiac. For the first time in Brandys career, I am very disappointed. With the exception of maybe one or two songs there is nothing memorable here. There is to much production going on which drowns Brandy out. Her voice has never been her strongest suit, but it's never bothered me til now. It's quiet and breathy, and doesnt work for the overproduced tracks. First single ""Talk About Our Love"" is probably the best track on here, and I suggest buying the cd single instead of the whole album. Finally, the last song on the album is called ""Should I Go"" and it samples the music from Coldplays ""Clocks."" It's a beautifully crafted song, and should be her next single if she's smart."
1,"aaliyah, beyonce, ashanti??","The album isn't that great. I don't know who's she's trying to be. First of all she's copying Aaliyah's music, Beyonce style and Ashanti's new single Turn It Up. Im not feeling this album at all except for one song Should I Go yes hun I think it's time to hang it up. Never Say Never will always be her best album."
3,Change of Heart,"When I heard this CD when it was first released, I felt that it was a huge disappointment. The only song I really liked was Turn It Up, but I have since had a change of heart and added this to my collection. After giving it another listen (well, a few more listens actually), I have found that it's a decent effort by Ms. Norwood. Some of the lyrics are still really silly...""everything he eats I cook,"" ""have 3 or 4 kids by you and some more if you ask me to."" And Sadiddy, that album filler she so desperately doesn't want to have, is just that. Otherwise, I'll give it a C for Afrodisiac, Should I Go, Turn It Up, Who Is She To You, Cool, Focus, and Where You Wanna Be. I wonder now with all of the controversy surrounding her whether Ms. N is still wondering if she should go or should she be looking for another record deal. Never Say Never is still her best effort. Brandy is #2, Full Moon #3 and this would be my least favorite."
4,Good,"When I first heard the CD all the way through, I was like ""What""? Like it was with Lauren Hill's Miseducation. But the first time I heard Afrodisiac, that was a song that got me liking it. You can tell it is a different style and sound for Brandy. I think it good and brave of her to do it. No more DarkChild. Sad, but over that. Good Brandy."
4,HOTTER THAN A 90 DEGREE DAY,"WOW!!!!! THIS IS HOT---IF YOU ARE A TRUE BRANDY FAN OR JUST TRYING TO GET TO KNOW MORE ABOUT HER--NOW AND THIS ALBUM IS THE TIME. ALL THE SONGS ARE HOT!!!. FROM BEGINNING TO END, FRONT TO BACK, UPSIDE DOWN TO RIGHT SIDE UP THIS IS A GREAT CD TO ADD TO YOUR SELECTION. SHE HAS GROWN AS A WOMAN AND ARTIST. KEEP UP THE GOOD WORK BRAN. (:>)"
4,should i go?,"i must say that this is unlike any other brandy lp. while it's not so commercial friendly and scoring top 10's...it's gritty, ecclectic and eccentric. the lead single is not proof of that at all...actually all the songs on here r better than the single. tracks i liked were ""who i am, who is she 2 u?,focus and of course should i go? That ballad is amazing w/the sampling of Coldplays' clocks. It's not only clever but is an ode to the bands amazing music. I think it may be a single because everyone is talking about that song. While this isn't as striking as ""aaliyah"" gritty as ""moodring"" or ""after the storm"" it declares that brandy is finally an individual who was willing to take risks and stray from commercial rnb. This effort is surprisingly good and w/o the numerouse filler ( full moon). Her best yet!"
5,Brandy has reclaimed her title as Princess of R&B/Hip-Hop,"This is by far, Brandy's best album. This album can hold its own against top R&B; albums like Beyonce's 'Dangerously In Love' and Mary J. Blige's 'My Life'. Brandy made the best move for her career after the poor appreciation of her last album 'Full Moon'. Timbaland has brought Brandy back to the forefront where she deserves to be now and has been in the past. This album showcases her vocal ability as well as stretching her wings as a songwriter and vocal arranger/producer. This album is definitely recommended for those who love Brandy as well as those who enjoy R&B;/Hip-Hop music. And I'm going to go out on a limb and say that this is by far, the best album of the summer!!Favorite TracksWho I AmWho Is She 2 UAfrodisiacTalk About Our LoveI TriedHow I FeelShould I Go"
4,Brandy's Best,"No one should have doubt that this album would flop, with Timbaland and Kanye West productions, any singer would be set for music success. What's amazing here is listening to Brandy's vocal growth. She's singing with and against her music, and gives more meaning than ever to her lyrics. Afrodisiac doesn't carry a consistent theme, but Brandy's Afrodisiac still is a fantastic production."
5,WOOOOOOWWWW!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!,I can't stop listen to this cd...This is Brandy's best cd to date. Grammy material!!!
5,Too Much Haters on Here!,"This cd is the best of 2004...I'm noticing the negative reviews are only coming from the Beyonce, Alisa Keys, Ashanti & Usher fans. Anyone who doesn't think this is the best cd of 2004 is pure and simple hating...This cd is a must have!"
5,Lovin It!!!,"I Love this Album, I bought it today when it came out and its the hottest album out right now (to me) Go buy it, im sure u'll feel the same, her voice is awsome, original sounding and sure to win u over, GO BRANDY!"
3,Pretty Good,"I think this album is a pretty good follow-up to full moon. I must commend her because it took a relatively short time for her to come out with a new album despite the personal issues she's going through. However I feel like all the references to Aaliyah are little overbearing and from someone who followed Brandy and Aaliyah from the beginning of their careers, down-right phony. I never recall Brandy giving any love to Aaliyah when she was alive so where does all this so-called admiration come from? Would it have been the same if Timbaland had not produced tracks for her?Her voice tends to drown out on the Timbaland tracks, but seems to do nicely with Kayne West(he should have produced the entire album). Overall it's a typical Brandy album, if you bought her others albums, buy this one. As she said at her album release party in NYC you know she gotta child to feed...."
2,Waste Of Awesome Tracks,"WOW.... this is one of this cd's with incredible producers..... Timbaland, Kanye West... just to name a few.... with a mediocre washed up singer.... I just wished Aaliyah was still alive to absolutely rip through these tracks with her incredible voice.... I just think that brandy's voice sounds soo fake.... think Ashanti..... by the way its been selling... I think people agree that the beats are better than her weak melodies..... and non powerful vocals....."
3,"Not a perfect album, but worth to buy","I think Brandy's ""Afrodisiac"" is worse than her previous effort ""FullMoon"". I do doubt whether other reviewers have listend to ""FullMoon"" before comparing these two albums. Anyway, this album is pretty cool and Brandy's got her own style though the producers are changed. This is the ablum that you need time to digest before you would like it, unlike her ""Never-Say-Never""."
5,SIMPLY THE BEST R&B ALBUM OF THE YEAR,"Brandy definitely has matured into a very talented woman. From Brandy to Afrodisiac, you can truly see the growth of Brandy as an woman and as an artist. This album does not dissapoint. Every single song stands out, no album filler here. Some poeple may not like it becuase they're not used to this Brandy, but if you know good music and great talent, this album is definitely for you. YOU NEED THIS ""AFRODISIAC"" IN YOUR ALBUM COLLECTION."
4,the best yet,wussup y'all just want to tell y'all about afrodisac .please go buy it it is soo beat heavy and real. every song you feel like she talking striaght to you. brandy aND TIMbland did a off the chain job on this album. support your girl NO BOOTLEGGGING. save your money and buy it
5,Too Bad the rest of America didn't catch on,"This was arguably one of the best R&B cds of 2004. It was so genious, but unfortunatley the rest of America didn't really care. Keep doing your thang brandy!!!"
4,A thoroughly enjoyable glimpse into Brandy,"Afrodisiac is a touching glimpse into the soul of a woman who has experienced and overcome a great deal of turmoil; a lifelike blending of sadness and happiness, softness and edginess.There was still some of the busyness that detracted from Full Moon, but this album is nevertheless a significant improvement. Brandy this time shows even more conviction and believable emotion.I'd have liked to hear the vocals more 'unplugged.' While Brandy did do a very good job on vocals, the heavy use of layering tended to take focus away from them. Still, Brandy's got a very sweet, soft voice that makes for some very pretty ballads. That's not to say it's all soft; there are some sassy numbers, too.Brandy's performance on this album is not only skillful, but also personal, genuine, and beautiful; although I miss the vocal clarity that made Never Say Never my all-time favourite. You will definitely want both in your music collection."
2,Come Back Brandy,"I listened to this cd several times in hopes that it would grow on me. Unfortunately, it didn't and I regretfully give it 2 stars. I really like Brandy's voice and her positive image, but I must be objective. I understand an artist's need to change and experiment, but change doesn't always equal growth. Bandy's voice here is as beautiful as always but is drowned by Tim's overbearing production. She sounds totally uninspired and seems to be trying too hard to compsensate for the subpar material. I must admit to liking four of the songs but that's not quite enough to justify more than two stars. I still love Brandy and will buy her next cd.... I just hope she chooses better material next time out."
2,"What happened, Brandy?","I previewed this album on MTV's The Leak, and I didn't like it. There were just a few decent tracks... If you want a better Brandy album, buy her 1998 release, ""Never Say Never""."
1,Tired.....tired.....tired (Yawn),"What has happened to Brandy?!? Her voice seems to become weaker and weaker with each CD. Nothing will ever compare to her Sophmore CD: Never Say Never- that CD was awesome! This CD is just WAY too over produced!!!! I am SO sick of the Timbaland sound, not to mention his voice...his ""uh-huh's"" & ""yeas"" HAS to go! A horrible CD. The only 2 songs I can handle on here is: Saddidy & Should I Go......the rest is just trash. She needs to take it back a bit and pop out the hits like she did in 1997. Do not bother!!!!!"
1,Yeah Alicia Keys is way better,"How can you diss Alicia Keys like that? She is the number one best selling RnB artist out there. Come on guys, stop listening to crap. Brandy isn't all that. ""You don't know my name"" was a huge hit by Alicia Keys, and you can't deny that. Alicia Keys will top Brandy always. Thank god for Alicia."
1,Alicia Keys is better,Alicia is the number one best selling RnB artist. Lets grow up. Brandy will never be like Alicia Keys. Period. Grow up.
3,R-U Kidding Me,"This is not nearly as good as her First 2 CDs.Where's Rodney? How many songs did 'Dark Child' produce.I only like 3 songs, not enough to buy the CD. I really like Brandy, but disappointed at this attempt..."
4,Talk about music,"Despite what others have said of this album i seem to disagree.I think this cd has potential enough to reach at least platinum status.She has some songs that just should not have made the cutFor instance: ""Necessary"",""Focus"" but the majority of the album has a mature sound and she is telling you from her point of view and personal experiences. Missing from this album is the sappiness and sugar-coated approach to a song as her other albums but the hooks are still there.The beats are crazy though sometimes timabaland's hard beats drown her gritty raspy voice out.Her magic is shown on the songs done with kanye west.The best songs on the album are: TAlk about our love,Afrodisiac,who she 2 u,finally,The coldplay inspried song Should I. I Think brandy has another hit on her hands.If your looking for good r&b music then pick up brandy's latest. It's a really well put together album and i think we can only expect even better material the next time around You Go brandy!"
5,Underrated Modern R&B Masterpeice,"This is one truly underrated record. Not only is this in my opinion the best work Timbaland as done thus far it also shocases the Brandy's inventive mind in regards to the jaw dropping vocal production on this album. Personal favourites of mine are Saddidy, I Tried, Say You WIll etc. For all the people who are skeptical I was not even a fan hers at all but I found it for Four dollars in my local record store and it blew me away. If you are open minded about music as I am (I just listened to Godflesh and Neurosis) than give it a go you will be suprised"
3,Brandy Shows Her Best & Her Worst,"1. Who I Am - A personal opening song - 5/10 Stars2. Afrodisiac - Definitly the best track on the album - 10/103. Who Is She To U - Also a great track, very catchy - 8/104. Talk About Our Love - One of the best as well - 8/105. I Tried - 2nd best song on the album - 9/106. Where You Wanna Be - Nice slower song - 5/107. Focus - Not a bad song once you get into it - 7/108. Sadiddy - Great up-tempo song - 7/109. Turn It Up - Takes a few listens before liking it - 5/1010. Necessary - Don't know how it made the album - 2/1011. Say You Will - Once again, not the best work - 1/1012. Come As You Are - You either luv it ot hate it - 4/1013. Finally - Starts off well but then dies down - 4/1014. How I Feel - Not a good or bad song - 5/1015. Should I Go - Another space filler - 1/10"
5,Afrodisiac,"I remember this album when I was 17. I love this album and played it constantly. I bought it 5 days after it came out. This album is the most accomplished,passionate,and personal collection . This album is determined to express Brandy's inner spirit in ways she would never before attempted on record. This album is all about Brandy. Afrodisiac marks a major milestone on her remarkable artistic journey. This album has been certified Gold. Remember,this was 2004."
2,Thoroughly Disappointed,"I'm so much a Brandy fan that I refuse to burn her CDs for other people. I would strongly suggest that she contact the individual(s) who produced ""Never Say Never"", because this ""Afrodisiac"" CD is mediocre at best. I cannot hear the potential of another single that can be released on the radio. Where are my nice ballads?????? After the 'D' rated ""Full Moon"" CD, I expected a lot more. This CD can only get a 'C', and that's being generous. ""Never Say Never"" got an 'A' and maintains it's 'A' grade to this day. I'll have to chalk this one up as a lost, again !"
2,What a let down!!!!!!!!!!!!!!,"After hearing her perform a few times,and being almost amazed at all of the support and promotion she was recieving, I decided to buy Brandy's Afrodisiac---BIG mistake!!!!!!! Vocally, the album is god, and the beats are nice as well, but this new sound is terible! Like everyone is saying, it souds like something Aaliyah put out! Don't believe the hype this album is not that good! I therfore do not recommened it because of it's sheer tackiness and utter disrespect for the sound that made Aaliyah!!!!!!!"
2,GO BACK TO RODNEY!!!,"I am Brandy's #1 fan, but this album does not represent the Brandy I feel in love with. Rodney Jerkins created a sound with her that was incredible, and although he may have prostituted that sound for other artist like, Toni Braxton, and Destiny's Child....He is a producer. That's what they do. Brandy if you're listening, please make amends with Rodney and get back in the studio. We love the way the two of you sound TOGETHER! This cd is not BRANDY quality. I actually bought it and gave it away."
1,Work on your voice Brandy,It seems that every year Brandy voice gets worse and worse. Her voice just doesn't live up to the material on this album.
5,B-Rocka is still the Best to me!,"Brandy aka B-Rocka is one of the best female aritist around. She has always been my favorite R&B; artist since her self-Titled debut album ""Brandy"" dropped in 1994. Nearly a decade later, her voice, her sound, her swagger has only improved. Her voice is like a treasure, once you've discover it, you'll never want to forget it. All of her albums (1994's Brandy, 1998's Never say Never, 2002's Full Moon & 2004's Afrodisac) are certified classics in my book, expecially Afrodisiac. Every song on the album is soulful, some great dance tracks and some really relaxing R&B; slow cuts. Brandy does not get the credit she deserves, which is why Afrodisiac didn't get alot of radio play and/or press. This album should be 2x Platinum if it's not already.My Favorite Tracks:1. Who Is She 2 U?2. How I Feel3. Afrodisiac4. Saddidy5. Where I Wanna Be ft. T.I.6. Come As You Are7. Turn It Up8. Talk About Our Love ft. Kanye West"
4,Solid effort,"Brandy's fourth album AFRODISIAC is in my opinion her best cd. The grooves are tight, and it definately feels like her most personal. She got away from working with Darkchild and brought in some new producers for a new sound. While vocally she hasn't always been the strongest, she always sounds nice regardless. This album shows us a more mature Brandy. Some highlights include ""Who I Am"", ""Turn It Up"", ""Come As You Are"", ""Talk About Our Love"", ""Who Is She 2 U"" and more. An underrated R&B album."
5,Who I Am: The Queen is back for her throne,"Feel the pain in her voice, hear the struggle in her lyrics but don't count brandy's afrodisiac out. this album is truly a must have. If you loved Ushers forth album-Confessions then ladys this is the female verison for ya'll. so the next time you haters want to write a bad reviews first listen to the album and take a ride with brandy and experience who she is, ride the waves of afrodisiac and i'm sure you won't want to get off. i give this album a billion stars if i could not because i'm a brandy fan but because 10 years in the music game, and she didn't have to sell her body or her woman-hood to sell records. that's a true artist. keep doin' yo thang bran-bran"
5,BEST OF 2004!,Brandy really out did herself this time...Timberland hooked da gurl up fo real. I can't stop listening to this cd...Move ova B-Rocka is back in full force. Go get da CD you won't be disappointed. Trust!
4,Return of a Diva,"I've been a fan of Brandy's since the beginning of her career. Although I'd rather see her work with Rodney Jerkins again, this album shows so much growth for her as an artist. I'm not really big on Timb and his monotonous producing, but Brandy's sultry, soulfull voice is remarkable. My favorite track is ""Should I Go"" where she uses the cold play joint (wonderful). I think this cd is a must have for music and brandy lovers alike."
5,The best female album of 2004,"Ok there is Beyonce, there is Alicia Keys but Brandy is there and we shouldn't forget that. This album is really good. All the songs are good and it deserves much more than what it got on the charts. Thats true that there are not a lot of potential singles but the album as a whole is a bomb.My favourite songs are :- Focus ( I like her deep voice on this song)- Talk About Our Love- I Tried- Where You Wanna Be- Who Is She 2 U"
3,3.5 for Afrodisiac.,"I thought this album would take it where 'Never say Never' left off since 'Full Moon' did not do the job. Afrodisiac is overall an okay album but its not a great album in Brandy's standards. She's not curving her own path with this album but rather is following in the path of Beyonce, who came and did her thing. I only like couple of songs on this album(The title track 'Afrodisiac', 'come as you are' and 'finally). Her new single produced by the over-rated Kanye West is performing horribly on the charts and if that's an indication of what Brandy can expect in terms of success for this album, then she's in trouble.Monica/Beyonce/Mary and Alicia all came out with better offering, they released albums which were personal to them and albums which the listner can listen to over and over again.Better luck next time Brandy."
2,NO SATISFACTION,"I was unhappy with Brandy's latest effort. This is actually the first time i've brought one of her cd's, and this was a disappointment. Something extra to add to the collection. I COULD HAVE SAVED MY MONEY!!!"
1,Give it up girl!,You are no Ashanti and you never will be! Ashanti is so much better than you ever will be and you are so desperate to want the kind of success she has but you can only dream of! Get some singin lessons too. You sound like your on the rag!
5,Brandy's newest album is the best one yet!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!,"Brandy's new album is so amazing. Her vocal abilities have you on the edge of your seat waiting for ever note. She gives you her heart and soul, in an album, whose lyrics sound like they could be ripped from the pages of her diary. Brandy didn't get enough recognition with ""Full Moon"", which wasn't as bad as people make it, but ""Afrodisiac"" makes you want to tell the world your deepest darkest secret. With songs about love found, love lost, and the in betweens, Brandy's new album is a must have for every music fan of true R&B."
4,Brandy fan 4-life,I have been a Brandy fan from day one.She is phenomenol. Afrodisiac is great. All you haters needs to stop hatin.Brandy can sing. She's has her own style just like any other artist.
5,Brandy's Best!,"This is the best album she ever made in her career. She's grown up and became more mature and all that is evident after you take a listen. She talks abot heartbreak, love, and self-discovery. This is the best album for your R&B; collection or the ultimate Brandy fan.Song highlights: Who I Am, Focus, Sadiddy, I Tried, Should I Go (very deep song, states something about the late, great Aaliyah)"
4,Brandy has found her comfort zone,"Following in the footsteps of the late Aaliyah and TLC, Brandy has created her own dark and sensuous masterpiece. Like ""Aaliyah"" and ""Fan Mail"", the dark- but sexy vocals are like missing pieces to a puzzle when driven over the funky beats. The album's first single ""Talk About Our Love"" is reminiscent to the ol' school 90's R&B. Brandy's smooth-raspy voice slithers through the entire track with perfection, only to be met with Kanye's unique rhyming style. Other unique soundscapes on the album include: "" I Tried"", ""Sadiddy"", ""Should I Go"", ""Focus"", ""Who Is She 2 U"", and the title track."
1,Not satisfactory,"The binding is not leather, which is ok, but it is bound so tightly that the inner columns are hard to read because it doesn't lay flat.Also, mine is missing the entire book of Genesis and starts at Exodus 20. How does that happen?One of the reviewers said that she liked the margins because she likes to make a lot of notes. I do too, but there isn't enough room. Otherwide, quality of materials is good."
2,great purchase,I purchased the bible as a birthday gift for someone who now does not want to wear glasses. They are so happy with the large print. Only friends cans do stuff like this.
3,fair,"First, this Bible is not leather, it is flex or fake leather. Second, the pages are okay, but there are no frills here. Just a decent Bible for family devotion, etc."
2,Not Giant Print,"I own a Nelson 883C Giant Print Reference KJV Bible. Nelson does not make that version anymore but it is possible to find them elsewhere. This bible is the 884C and the font size is at least 1 probably more like 2 sizes smaller than my 883C. So in comparison to my original GIANT print, this is at best Large print.The 883C is 1825 pages, this 884C is 1400. So I assume that discontinuing the original GIANT print edition and making the smaller font the new ""Giant"" was probably a good marketing decision for Nelson but not for my eyes.I'll be sending this one back."
3,Reasonable Bible for the price but not a great bargain,"The Bible is described incorrectly, it is imitation leather which one would expect from the price. The quality of the imitation lather and binding is satisfactory. The color is apparently random. Mine was red but from other reviews I get the impression that sometimes it is black. My biggest complaint is that the type is not a very intense black and the pages are not an intense white so there is not as much contract between the text and pages as one would like. There is another large print Bible coming out in the same price range that is worth considering although I have not seen it yet. It is ISBN 159856000X and the Amazon price is $12.92."
5,Good book,"Easy to read print. Looks good on the outside, invaluable information on the inside. The book is a KJB which is closest to the original script."
3,"Great book, wrong cover","I love the giant print on this Bible, but Amazon continues to advertise it as leather bound, when the wrapping on the Bible specifically says it is leatherette, which everyone knows means it is fake leather. Good price, but you need to know what you're getting."
4,LOVE it,"Bought this pillow at 15 weeks pregnant with my first. Its a little slice a heaven. Its a bit spendy for a pillow, but the comfort it has provided for me in the last couple of weeks is totally worth it. I also like that it doesnt take as much of the bed as other body pillows (my husband is grateful for that!) I also like that this can be split apart and used as a boppy later on.The only thing I would change is to have some sort of a washable cover for when it is in 1 piece. Thus why I rate 4 instead of 5 stars. It does comes with cheap feeling covers for the ends when it is broken apart, but that doesnt do anything for me until I take it apart. Overall, very happy with the purchase and highly recommend it."
2,could be better so much better,"I bought this pillow bc I really didn't see one really bad review on it. When I got it I was so happy, but than came putting the pillow covers on which was not fun or easy by any means. But with the pillow covers on, it makes the pillow shorter, which if your a long tall person, its hard to stretch out and even be in it at all. So I just took the covers off completely, which gave me more room. But the main problem was the pillow for your head was the same thickening as the other side which make your head sit up too high, and made my neck hurt. If the pillow on one side was not as thick where my head could lay and be even with my spine, I would be more than pleased. So that's how I feel about it all. Now the pillow sits on the floor next to me, I'm hoping I can find another use for it, since I put so much money into it."
2,not comfy for the head,"The pillows were hard, it was great for in between the legs, but not for comfort on the head, I couldnt use the pillow for my head."
4,Went flat after a month of use.,"I researched for weeks before investing into this pillow because of the price. I looked everywhere for the perfect pillow and after reading all the reviews, went with this one. When it first arrived, I was so excited because it truly helped my sciatic nerve problem in my back and I really have not had any issues with my back due to pregnancy since I began using it. The only complaint I have is that now, after about a month of heavy use, I am left with two flat pillows, attached together, which takes up a lot of space in the bed. It is not doing much as far as putting space between my legs when sleeping on my side, and most of the time I now am having to double it over and put the entire thing under my legs. I'm not as impressed as I thought I would be. I would have been if the pillows remained firm or where made out of another material."
1,TOTAL RIP-OFF and IMPOSSIBLE TO GET RID OF,"This product has been a total headache. Compare with what the other reviews say about this product and you can see this is obviously a terrible product. The product showed up broken, the compressor doesn't work, so the ""cold"" water is almost as hot as the hot water. When I inquired about exchanging the product with Haier, it took 4 calls and 3 weeks of run-arounds to discover I had to pay an extra $15 to exchange it!!! (extra money for a product that never worked???)The customer service was near hostile in my dealings with them, and maintained the attitude of ""hey, you bought it, it's not our problem anymore."" Amazon made it slightly easier to return for a refund, but I feel that I shouldn't have been in this position to start with.All I can say is that to save yourself alot of time and money, BUY SOMETHING ELSE NOT FROM HAIER.And AMAZON, if you actually read any of these, get rid of this product, it makes you look bad."
2,*DISAPPOINTED AND FRUSTRATED*,the first one I recieved was cracked on top amazon was wonderful when I wrote to them they shipped out a replacement right away then I recieved the second one it worked for 3 weeks then the fridge wouldnt work and it wouldnt produce cold water anymore just warm so I wrote amazon and again they were wonderful and gave me a refund but ocourse I didnt have the original box so I had to go buy one and bubble wrap which costed $20.00 to send it back I was grateful amazon paid the shipping over all Im very disappointed I have family coming and its hot and no water dispenser thats why I ordered early before my family came *DO NOT BUY THIS PRODUCT YOU WILL BE DISAPPOINTED
1,Haier Water Dispenser WDNS055,This water dispenser does not work properly. It dispenses trickle of water only. The cold water faucet stops completely once the cold button is turned on. Would not buy anything from Haier.
5,Inspirational Gift,This book was purchased as an inspirational gift for a friend. This person enjoyed the book immensely. I also own a copy of it.
1,A sheep in wolf's clothing............,"When I was given this book as a gift, all of my ""red flags"" went up. This is definitely not a Christian book, but a New Age one. It does not line up with the Bible although it does pluck Scriptures out of the bible for use with its message.....I immediately returned this book to the bookstore and bought a Christian devotional, one that recognizes the Lordship of Jesus in the life of a born again Christian....for it is the bible itself that says ""you must be born again"" (John 3:3) Hopefully, this type of book has not deceived any Christians out there, but for those who like New Age books, this is a good one for them."
3,Funny and totally mindless!!,TWO NEW YORKERS TRAVOLTA AND GROSS HAVE BEEN TRICKED TO OPEN A NIGHTCLUB IN NEBRASKA BUT IN REALITY THEY ARE TRANSPORTED TO THE USSR TO TEACH MANNERS TO RUSSIAN SPIES LIVING IN THE UNITED STATES. TOTALLY MORONIC SCRIPT WITH A SENSE OF STUPIDITY BUT YET IT'S FUN TO SEE TRAVOLTA MAKE A FOOL OF HIMSELF. IT'S SILLY BUT YET FUNNY BUT NOTHING YOU WANT TO SEE AGAIN AND AGAIN.
3,"Hard to find, blast from the past!","I remember watching this ages ago... I was glad to find it again here, it's difficult to get ahold of.Apparently it's the movie John Travolta and Kelly Preston met on the set of.It's fun 80's comedy -great if you want to reminisce."
5,Really wonderful!,"I love this movie and have been waiting for years for it to come out on DVD. I'm not like some other posers who are armchair critics (or wish they were) and wanna-be directors who cut down movies for one stupid reason or another. I analyze a movie on how it makes me feel, and how it makes me laugh. This one does deserve 5 stars and I think it's one of Travolta's better roles, at least from the 80's. I liked it as much as Two of a kind. My favorite part was the Russian pilot that just couldn't get American slang correct. Cracks me up every time I see it."
3,"Butler's stories are gems, biographies are not.","The problem with this book is definitely notButler's fiction writing. She paints vivid, often stark, portraits of the alien but all too familiarhabitats of her mind. The problem is that thereare far too few short stories, and far too manyautobiographical articles. It is surely nota coincidence that the stories chronologically come first in this collection.Still, a true sci-fi fan will value this collection for the notes Butler includes at the end of each story. The notes are often personal, but provide excellent insight into the workings of a writer."
2,Butler has been better...,"""Bloodchild"" seems to be decent effort, but too much was lacking and too much was added. The biographical prose was interesting, but...it somehow made the stories seem disconnected from each other. All well and good, we don't really need to know what motivates each story. Leave something to the imagination. The title story was too long, and it seemed to be very hard to get into; five years after I first purchased the short-story collection I STILL HAVE NOT read to the end of Bloodchild. And I have read everything Ms. Butler ever wrote, including ""Survivor."" The story about the alcoholic I ""just didn't get,"" and the others were okay, but all in all, this book averages out as being not very engrossing. I applaud Octavia Butler for giving us short stories, but I wish they could have been more interesting."
2,The absolute worst gain before feedback ever...,"These microphones, seemed like a good alternative to something like the shure pg48, which is a totally usable mic, not amazing, but works fine. So i was thinking maybe i should get these, since i found my self spending too much renting sm58s for live shows(i'm a live sound engineer by the way). So whatever, i went for it, i said what the heck they're sennheisers right? How bad can they possibly be? they should be at least as good as my pg48s right? Well... WRONG. These microphones have probably the worst gain before feedback of any microphone i've ever tried, and i'm not exaggerating! i mean, feedback rejection IS the main reason why i bought these microphones! These mics are totally unusable for live applications, not even loud karaokes! If u wanna go ahead and totally blow 130 dollars on 3 pieces of crap, go ahead and be my guest! But don't say u weren't warned, i wish I read an honest review like this before i bought this garbage..."
3,I'd say 3 and a half...,"It's a great album, but it gets a bit repetitive. Not much of a change from the first album's formula: melodic verses and driving choruses, the occasional scream but usually a very Chris Cornell yell, and groove oriented guitars and rhythm section. If you like hard rock in a slightly more ""stoner"" vein than Soundgarden, you'll enjoy this. The last song makes the record, the jam out at the end is very much Pink Floyd without being too derivative. Worth picking up, check them out live too."
5,great,"Great service and arrived early. GreatEST POLISH i HAVE EVER USED IN 56 YEARS OF POLISHING CARS, METAL AND BRASS IN 30+Y NAVY CAREER."" I will use this Seller again!!!! This is GREAT PRODUCT AND GREAT SELLER "" Give it a try."
1,Horrible & cheaply made,"Horrible & cheaply made. At first I thought I had only been sent one by mistake because they were so light and flimsy, but there really were two. They arrived stacked together like most pans should be, but I couldn't get them apart. I even tried prying them apart with a screwdriver...no luck. Plus the one on top had tiny pits in it. Back they went."
2,Cookie Pans,"Not the quality as described, and one came with dents. This is the first item I had to return to Amazon. Still, great customer service!!!!"
2,"Lightweight, thin, flimsy, poor quality","Lightweight, thin, flimsy, poor quality. It was shipped in the same box as a can opener and arrived with dents. I decided I'd better buy these in person. I went to JCPenney's and looked at the Cooks line and the Paula Deen line of baking sheets/jelly roll pans. Those are much, much, much thicker & heavier compared to this one and they cost less too (on sale). I don't recommend this at all"
2,Flimsey,"I wanted this exact size for a particular recipe, but was very disappointed in the quality. It was thin, flimsey, even dented. Pass on this item."
2,Not as thick as I thought it would be,"Just got this have no used yet, size wise it's perfect but I thought the pan would be thicker it's not thick at all. Not sure how it will hold up for making pumpkin rolls."
5,Great loaves of bread,"These work very well in helping to shape and proof loaves of bread. They leave a nice swirl pattern on the surface of the loaf. When floured, they release the bread very easily, avoiding the sticking so often found when baking artisan breads."
4,small banneton,"This banneton was good quality & the seller was quick in shipping it to us, but it was smaller than what we wanted for the size loaf we make. Return was easy even though we had to call the seller to get an RA, he returned the call immediately and approved the return, notifying the clearinghouse he works through for us."
5,Perfect fit and a nice accessory pocket...,"Granted, this case does have a velvet-like finish so it won't slip into your pocket as easily as it otherwise might. However, it does fit my S330 camera like a glove. It also has a nice accessory pocket on the front that zips open like a book to reveal two pouches large enough to hold an extra CompactFlash card and an extra battery. It's the only case I've found that's built specifically for the S330, and I'm very pleased with it."
1,Picture is deceiving,"Ithought that this case would be perfect for my s330. I purchased it and saw immediately that the picture gave me the wrong impression. The fabric of the case is a felt like material and the color is almost purple. Yes, it does fit to the camera perfectly, and yes, it is 10 dollars, but it still made the camera more bulky. I was looking for something that would be a nice cover to place over the camera (that doesn't add any additional weight or bulkiness) so that when I place the camera in my pocket or my backpack it would not get scratched. This case simply fell short. A waste of 10 bucks for my needs. I am back to the drawing board."
5,kaleidoscopic meditation,"I loved puzzles as a kid but havent done them since. Now I'm 40 and trying to find myself and the first order of business was getting a puzzle. My first was a 500 piece Ravensburger puzzle featuring antique prints of flowers and alphabet. It was a good first but I was done with it pretty quickly.This was my second puzzle. It's exquisite. If you are interested in color study or ever ask yourself ""What is blue?"" or ""What is red?"" This is the puzzle for you . It's pretty hard going, 1000 pieces, The end result is stunning. I read that this was designed by FLW as to be a backlit glass piece. How amazing that must've been.Anyway, it's worthy of wall hanging and if you like working on hard-core abstractions then, to quote Ben Stiller playing Starsky (or Hutch?), ""Do it, do it, do it."""
2,"Could have been a fun ride, but...","Decades ago, Leopold Stokowski popularized opera for the general public through ""symphonic syntheses."" These included Wagner's Ring, Triastan, and Boris Godunov, to mention those I've heard and enjoyed. I was prepared to enjoy Maazel's modern update and expected a fun ride through the gorgeous sonorities of Wagner's score.Not much enjoyment resulted, however. Maazel is superficial, often ponderous, and much too roughshod with this pastische. It can't all be crash and bang. So I threw the CD away and hope a few others won't make the mistake I did."
2,Castration upon synthesis,"Should you want an abstract from Ring, take Great Scenes Solti one CD form, with voices. Should you hate voices and search a wordless synthesis, this would not be te best choice. Please read my review to ""The Ring,an orchestral adventure"", where Vlieger (well conducted by Jarvi) shows a mutilated unforgivable shape as Maazel does here. I agree with Alexander Arsov 1 star review.Both ""finales"" of Rheingold and Die Walkure are missing, although label includes ""Entry of the Gods"" and ""Wotans farewell""Flavio J MorschBrazil"
3,Overpriced Intro to the Ring,"This compilation of the most well-known musical moments from Richard Wagner's Ring cycle is a good resource for the most well-known instrumental motifs of the cycle. However, I am of the opinion that another conductor would have maybe enjoyed the job better. Unless the playback speed of this set was increased in error while undergoing digitization, Mr. Maazel seems have confused hurrying through the score with presenting an energetic performance. And a 'yo-ho-to-ho'-less ride with the Valkyries can never come to a good end. . .(Why buy this when you can get the entire Ring cycle for a dollar less?Wagner: Der Ring des Nibelungen- all 4 complete operas, nearly 15 hours of music, good vocal performances too, the magic and energy is there.)"
5,Best Works ever heard,"The Ring Without Words is my VERY favorite CD. People who enjoy Wagner's music will defintly love this CD. I only have one SMALL complaint. It's not the complete Ride of The Valkeries, but I didn't mind. This CD totaly changeded the way I think of Richard Wilhem Wagner! Very great busy masterpieces. Who gets this will be very pleaed and happy.Chance Kafka"
2,Not very good,"I bought this CD and was just very unimpressed with the conducting. Maazel just barrels through the music without any regard for its beauty, like he's in a hurry or something. I recommend George Szell's Wagner Without Words. It's much closer to the master's (Karajan's) style."
2,"Mediocre interpretation, great sound.","The idea of a long, continuous synthesis of the *entire* Ring is good, but Maazel's synthesis is too fragmentary. I know Stoki made one too, but I haven't heard his. I simply don't believe that a good synthesis is possible. So I'm going to stick with excepts. I recommend the classical Cleveland/Szell Sony disk (which is also cheap). As to Maazel's performance, I must say I find it dull and vulgar."
2,Disappointing,Such a good idea but so very poorly executed. Boring conducting and sloppy orchestral ensemble. There are very many so much better performances of the individual orchestral highlights . . why bother with this one.
3,Good for newbies,"If you have a family member or friend who is considering doing The Ring, but is dismayed that the price of a full ticket is about the same as the price for a small island in the Caribbean, you may wish to get this for them as an introduction and way to determine if The Ring is right for them. While it is not exactly all the highlights as I would select, it is a good sense of what to expect across 4 evenings of Ringing & Ringing. Some reviewers have written in surprise and indignation that this CD is ""just"" music, but if you look closely at the title, The Ring without Words, you will find a strong suggestion of that and won't be surprised at all. Admittedly, the pacing is often swifter than I would like, but again, as an intro it does a very good job of helping newbies assess interest and identify leitmotifs that can be recognized during the real thing, giving a sense of familiarity that can be comforting in such a long production."
2,barely literate,I couldn't decide which was scarier - the crimes of the murderers and cannibals or the illiterate ravings of the author.
3,Just OK,A full paper towel roll will slip from the holder if you pull it too hard. other than that it's fine.
5,exactly what I had been huntung for,I remembered these towel holders from a time long ago. Figured they were so simple and efficient that they would only be found in museums anymore...
3,Just ok,This towel holder is just ok. Not so bad that I'd return it but I should have listened to others that said it doesn't retain it's tension on the roll of paper towels.
4,Valuable space save,The product came in just as described and was very easy to mount. It feels durable and holds the paper towels well. Good buy.
3,Simple and effective,"So, its not a pretty paper towel holder, but it holds my paper towels. That's all I needed.- It comes with screws.- Its a simple design.- Unfortunately, I took two stars off because the tension has decreased. Now, every time I try to remove a paper towel, the whole roll comes popping out. Not a big deal mind you, I just have to be less lazy and use two hands. But, I have no regrets. It holds paper towels. Nuff said."
5,What a gem!,"I really wasn't expecting much when I ordered this for our camper.I was pleasantly surprised when we received it. We put it up and headed out.We live in Colorado and go over some VERY ROUGH roads. I was so shocked that the paper towelsstayed in the holder! Cabinet doors opened drawers, opened and things fell out but the papertowels help tight, LOL. We also have a ten year old boy who tends to just Yankon the towels. No problem with this holder. I may buy another for my home!"
4,Paper Towel Holder,I purchased this chrome finish Kitchen Paper Towel Holder to install in a Dentist cubicle. I used toggle screws to mount it because of the holes left in the wall by previous stainless steel paper towel holder had left. I also drilled two new holes in the new holder since they did not match the holes in the wall. The mounting took less than five minutes and looks great and works fine. I gave it 4 stars because it was not stainless steel.Decko Bath 38310 Paper Towel Holder
3,The Last Heiress,"In general terms, I enjoyed the Friarsgate series, it strikes me as odd that the original heiress went through so much to retain control of Friarsgate, but gave it up to her youngest daughter with hardly any emotion. It's like ""oh well, I'm got myself a new gorgeous husband and I'm leaving"". Very strange.Another oddity is Phillipa's (I may have her name wrong, but it's one of the first two books) husband is the best thing since sliced bread in her novel, only to be described here as rather stupid and only interested in hunting. Doesn't the author realize that fans remember things like that?"
2,BORING,"Having had the pleasure of reading ALL of Bertrice Small's books. I have been disappointed to say the least about The last Heiress... Sure the historical background is wonderful, Who can not love King Henry the 8th, his reign was legendary. Yet Poor Elizabeth's story is dull as dirt. Even at the luxurious King Henry's court, Elizabeth failed to be defrocked. Of course one did not expect her to get her groove on at boring Friargate, but none at court either??? Come on, where was the adventure, the passion, the erotic love scenes. If you are looking for that, keep looking, as it is not present in this story."
4,Better Than Philippa,"This first few chapters of this book was a bit boring but it got better when Baen and Elizabeth became close. I loved reading about them. Elizabeth was a lot more likable than Philippa.I felt a little sad near the end of this book, because, I knew it was the last one in the series. The Friarsgate series is not as good as the Skye O'Malley series but I did like the first two books in this series very much. Rosamund and Logan made the first two books enjoyable. If they had been featured a lot more in this book and in 'Philippa', I think the Friarsgate series would have been almost as good as the Skye O'Malley series.I wanted to read more about Rosamund and Logan but I still enjoyed this book."
1,Small disappoints Big,"Having devoured the Skye series, and finding them to be the absolute best of the historical romance genre, I found The Last Heiress to be a huge disappointment.The plot is comparatively simple.The reader waits for the adventure and intrigue of Small's previous novels, but it never comes. I find it hard to believe that this is even the same author.The plot is entirely predictable after chapter one. No surprises twists or turns. Save your money and skip this one."
3,This is nothing TOO special.....,"Gameboy started out years ago in black and white. Then it was color, then it was advance. All this is is an advance that has a backlit screen and that can charge. It's graphics and gameplay are most of the time poor, unless you have a sort of adventure game (Metroid, Poke'mon) The new system is out, The Nintendo DS and my friends are still adding THIS to thier Chritmas list, not the DS. The Ds is a lot better, and funner, the mini games on the DS are funner than half of the GBA games. Plus, GBA Sp dosn't have a headphone jack! (like you need one...) All it is is static kind of sound. All this is, is a GBA with a small twist, there is no difference in games or anything. Just get a DS, it has real sound, N64 graphics, and a touch screen! Or better off a GBA original."
4,Great,This is a great system. If you don't have a GBA or have one I would recommond getting it because its light and its a better playing divice because of the way it was formed.
5,Caution!Playing with this may result in fun!Adults Beware!,"Hi me again,the anoing 10 year old from the netherworld.First off I'd like to say it isn't invulnrable.It can break.I got mine back from Nintendo this week.Their phone number is 1-800-255-3700. I got it back in a week.This thing is awesome.I love playing Kingdom Hearts:COM on it.The buttons will not get sticky! It's as if it's impossible.This plays game boy,game boy color,and of course game boy advance games on it.Good bye,Earthlings"
1,Gameboy advanced sp-flame,i have not recieved this product??Where is it??????????? It's been along time with not answere about it what up people can't you find it?????????!!!!
4,shedding light on the SP,wow! this is nice. Fold down screen ensures no damage is done to the screen.Rechargeable batterys ensure that you can play forever. You can even play while chargeing. Much better than the game boy advance. Although I miss the BIGGGGGGG screen.
3,DS is better,"Anyone who thinks this is better than a DS is insane. Yeah, I know that it is complex, but my brother is six and he enjoys his almost as much as I do. The DS has a more solid feel with its buttons, and have also added X and Y. The DS also has a backlit screen and about 90% of the battery life. The sound on DS is incredible. The graphics are even more amazing. The DS also plays the SP games too so you can get them all. Go to Nintendo.com to compare graphics with the SP's. If you can't afford a DS, then simply get a GBA and go buy a worm light for $5. The games are the same as there are no games only for SP. The SP is like the first Nintendo ever. Go and buy that for $5. The DS is like Gamecube for $100. Well, I've made my choice."
1,worst color ever,this is the worst color you can get for an sp. when you play in the sun there is huge glare. if you are gonna get an sp get any other coler but this one
2,So What?,"So it fits in your pocket, and has a backlight, so what? Other than 1 of those 2 things it's basically the same thing as the GBA, but i prefer the GBA, because it has better grip."
3,Improvements?,"The light improves viewing, but darker games, (like Doom), are still hard to see in anything but a dark room. The game is a good deal more portable than the GB Advanced, but you trade off non-replaceable batteries. You could always carry or purchase a spare instead of waiting around for it to recharge. I wonder if the battery will be easily replaceable, of will you have the same problem as the IPOD, the battery is almost as costly as a new system. My single, biggest complaint is the headphones/. All the earlier units used a standard headphone jack any 1/8"" stereo headphones, (earbud, on the neck, or on the head), would work. The SP uses the same jack for charger and phones (included). You can purchase (about $6) an adapter that allows common headphones, but the included ones are uncomfortable, and almost incompatible with glasses."
2,Worn,"Recieved this item, was a little more worn than i wanted it to be but overall the thing is in good shape. No major scratches on the screen. Some minor scratches on the top."
1,Not as advertised,Turned the gameboy advance on and everything was fine until the picture suddenly went dark. Tried to hit the bright button and still very hard to see. Not pleased with the picture quality.
5,FANTASTIC BUY,"I bought this as a gift for my grandson that wanted one and he was very happy with it. The one I received had no scratches, worked well and the screen was in mint condition. I was very happy with this purchase. Thank you."
3,Gameboy system,"It was in ok shape, the background lite isnt very bright. But system does work. Was a little dissapointed in the lighting background."
3,Awesome...really?,"The shipping speed is fast, especially over the holidays, so that was a good point, and I was super excited to find it basically scratch free. It seemed like it was brand-new! I got one of my games and put it in, to test it, when suddenly the screen flashed and stayed frozen. I restarted it to make sure it wasn't the game, but it did it again. I removed the game and looked inside the slot and saw a HUGE gunk of grenn stuff lodged in the slot. It took me 15 gruesome minutes and a bent paper clip to get it out, and after that it was working just fine. My recommendation? Buy, but be careful of the possible surprise."
4,best game system evermade,"This is the best game system, my older sister has one its the greatest,if you get one you shoud get pokemon ruby or sapphire and to think i bought my SAD little gameboy i felt so nice. I will no longer write reviews for i am crying my eyes out. Farewell,your friend The great saiyaman"
4,Pretty cool,this is a great toy for some of us older kids. the only reason I rated it 4 stars is 'cause they need to put a head phone plug into it. (...)
2,Oprah - give me a break!,"Please, just because the topics are timely and the text is easy to read and hip; that does not make this a good book. Lets see.. the protagonist is HIV positive, runs away from her problems and falls in love with a man who killed a couple people and did time. There is no depth to the characters or the plot. I kept turning the pages waiting for more to happen, but it didn't. What a waste of time and money."
5,The vote from our book club was unanimous - we loved it!,From the first chapter we were hooked. Traveling with Ava from Atlanta to Michigan and through the trials and tribulations Idlewild sent us on our own journey of identification and self-discovery. It is a great book for all levels of readers.
5,A refreshing warm look at a 90's woman facing 90's issues,"This first novel was a delight to read. The characters were well developed and probably reminded you of someone you really knew. The complex societal issues explored were handled in a realistic and non-sugarcoated manner. I rejoiced at the peace and happiness Ada found in her life, in spite of the life threatening disease that she lived with. Hurry Ms. Cleage, I am waiting for your next release!"
5,Must Read,"This book grabbed me from the first page and didn't let me go until last. I finished it in 4 hours! It is so well written that you actually become part of the book and the daily lives of Ava, Joyce, Imani and Eddie. I only wish it were longer, so you have more time with these people."
4,Forces us to confront delicate issues.,"This was the first book that I purchased through Amazon.com,and after I was through reading it I decided to read the reviews to see if other people agreed with me in my impressions of ""What Looks Like Crazy on an Ordinary Day"". I think that the amount of people who wrote in to describe their feelings says it all...this book really makes a statement. It is extremely realistic in its language and descriptions and is also very easy to believe as being a true story. What unnerved me about some of the reviews is the bad grammar, horrible spelling, mistakes in the main character's name (for example: Ada, or Eva...Ava is correct) and mistakes in describing the plot. It makes me wonder if people truly understood or even READ the book. I appreciate Pearl Cleage's brutal honesty and unique style of storytelling. I look forward to a sequel. (?)"
4,Favorite Christmas Gift!,I received this book as a Christmas gift from my husband and let me tell you it was a great choice. I liked it so much that I am purchasing the hardback and passing on the paperback to friends. The characters were entertaining and came alive. The story was uplifting and enjoyable. I could not put it down! I recommended it highly.
4,Love triumphs in this book...,"What an enjoyable read! An HIV positive woman in transition sounds depressing, but this book is anything but. This book is about family, by blood and by friendship. Rich characters, good versus evil, today's society versus yesterday's society, are all subjects tackled with humor and insight."
4,Loved it,I own this on paperback....I LOVE this book; Pearl Cleage really pulls through and delivers on this. The other reviews say what I was going to but just know: this book is great. :)
5,What looks like a great book!,"As a 24-year old upper-middle class white girl, I wasn't sure I would enjoy and/or relate to this story of a 30-something black woman with HIV returning home to her increasingly troubled mostly-black hometown.Boy, was I wrong.This story was funny, touching, uplifting and downright inspiring. The author's main character, Ava Johnson, is a lot like me - she's discovering real love, struggling to find answers about her purpose, searching for spirituality, reconnecting with her family and hometown, and forging a new path in life.Right up there with ""The Girls' Guide to Hunting and Fishing"" this book is a must-read for a woman, regardless of where she is on her path to self-discovery."
5,Definitely one of the best books I've ever read,"This book was simply excellent. Pearl Cleage is an excellent writer who knows how to take hold of a reader's attention, and involve them in the story so much so to make them feel apart of the lives of the characters. You can not help but to fall in love w/ this book and the characters in it. It was just wonderful and I recommend that if you are contemplating reading this and you happen upon this comment - I advise you to order right away. You won't regret it."
4,a great selection,"Remembering back What Looks like..... was a great choice for Oprah's Bookclub.I can remember reading it as that month's selection. While I an continually disappointed with Oprah's book choices .What Looks like Crazy... was a very good selection.There's a phrase from this book that I will forever remember .""If any body ask you tell them I love me so ... what ever (his or her) name might be. As I remember it was a 4 /4.5* or quite possibly 5* read."
4,"Hopeful, energetic, informative","One of the most fun parts of this audio book is that it is read by the author herself. Her voice is warm and witty. She is so convincing that I had trouble separating her from the main character.Although I am sure that the written version of the book was good, I wonder if the audio version isn't the best way to experience Cleage's message. Because Cleage brings out the language and the culture with no holds barred. She understand the message she is trying to get out and she does it magnificently.Cleage presents HIV in a way that we need to understand it: i.e. something that happens to people we love. And then she shows us the way to cope and live hopefully."
1,Highly overrated - what was Oprah thinking?,"Contrived plot, inconsistencies in the story, predictable and sappy ending. Expected the quality of Quindlen and Lamb, the other Oprah Book Club entries I have read, and I was sorely disappointed. Don't bother."
1,Contrived and Ridiculous!,"What could have been a swift smack of reality turned out to be a disappointing waste of words. The story is far-fetched and the characters are laughable. Oprah, I love you girl, but I almost feel insulted by the inclusion of this book on your list!"
3,Basic good read.,"A middle of the road book. I would also place it in the middle of the Oprah selections. Not the best, but not the worst."
1,What was Oprah thinking???,"This book was awful! I've not met many books that I didn't enjoy, but this book was loaded cliches. This author took deep subject matter (Having HIV) and turned it into garbage.....I got to a point in the book where the main character said something along the lines of ""...and we sang the tunes we'd been practicing for a lifetime, oh yea, oh yea, oh baby yea yea yea. The saddest part of this book for me was that I paid retail. i want my money back!"
1,what could have been compelling..,"What starts out as a streetwise aspect to an interseting situation gets steadily more shallow and cliched as the story develops. The characters seem stereotyped and predictable, and not deep enough to care about. PLease, please if you're going to write about real tough issues that impact our lives, give us some real tough characters to deal with them."
3,Started off slow and picked up speed,Not a bad read. I wasn't sure what to expect but it turned out to be more interesting than I expected.
5,Crazy sometimes is Love - sometimes,"This was a wonderful book. It was worth 3 or 4 times the amount I paid for it. Actually it was a frebee on my android but I would have paid actual cash for it if I had known it is as good as it is. I enjoyed the charactors, the writing was not too descriptive but for me that was enough. It made me think in a different way around an issue that I've thought about before but now I had a new, different perspective to view it from. Don't know if this is understandable but it made the sadness - happy, livable!I'll read this author again."
4,"Very human, a bit raw in parts.","I'm from the area that she wrote about. There's a great deal of history in Idlewild. I thought her story was realistic, humorous, natural. I enjoyed the book very much."
2,Great Start Turns to Cliche,"After getting off to a wonderful start, with compelling characters and a light, fun tone, this book fails to develop. As she runs out of energy, Cleage falls back on weak cliches and ends her story unsatisfyingly. Worth reading only if there's nothing else around."
2,Very disappointing,"I kept reading this book hoping something about would redeem it, but except for the snappy language, it had nothing to recommend it. Ada could have been sympathetic, but she was so blase about being HIV positive that it worked against her. And Eddie, my goodness, who can really believe him as a character? From devil to saint? Really, I don't believe it. Sorry, but I really felt let down by this book."
4,A modern-day inspiration,"A main character returning home, in effect, to spend the remainder of her life is not expected to be a positive tale. But I found Cleage took me on a journey so true that it was with regret that I finished that last page. Ava is an inspiration as a woman in today's world. She dealt with her issues, all the while keeping it in perspective, and with an open heart and mind. Ava is, in my opinion, the epitome of a modern-day heroine."
1,A big let down,"What Looks Like Crazy has a lot of potential to be a must read but Cleage skipped all over the issues instead of bringing forth the deep concept of living with HIV, loving with HIV, drugs and other urban dilemmas, she just touched the surface and just abandoned the issues. This book was written on a juvenile basis and it just ended. I was highly disappointed. I pushed myself to finish this book and was glad when I finally did."
2,Say What?,"First, allow me to say, I'm glad you post book excerpts. I am definitely going to buy this book by Pearl Cleage. Why? Certainly not because of her literate writing style. Perhaps, this low-down and dirty descriptive way of writing is considered ""hip"". To me, it appears Pearl Cleage, just sat down one day, with a yellow steno pad, and starting scribbling away, free association, if you will. No method or madness to her style. Its kinda like sitting around the inner city stoops, and listening to talk you hear every day and certainly identify with, if you come from the inner city, that is. That's the catch, Pearl Cleage comes off as hard, not dispassionate, and makes no bones about the life and times she is depicting. The language is raw, rough and the view of life presented is disturbing. A Pulitzer winner? I think not. But I'll read it."
3,Ordinary,"I didn't have a problem reading the book from beginning to end, however the storyline was a bit predictable. Everything just came together so perfect and in such a cutesy romantic fashion, that it made the book less enjoyable. The character development could have been better. Its always good to read a happy ending, but the book was too happy and a bit unrealistic, even the terminal illness thrown in didn't seem to shake the characters up."
2,is that it?,"This story started out strong but was incredibly predictable. I kept reading because I thought it would get better. It didn't. What bugged me the most was that Eddie was ready to kill the teenage hoodlum for throwing a bottle thru the window - yikes!!! The teenager was completely unredeemable to him, which was totally weird since Eddie did much worse in his lifetime (that's putting it mildly), and he seemed redeemed. In fact, he had become a saint of sorts. And what about crazy church lady's motives? That part of the story was weak and just did not make much sense.I wanted Ava to continue doing hair - that was much more interesting than her ridiculously perfect romance. I gave it two stars because I did chuckle a few times, and some of the story was original and interesting. Sorry, Oprah, this was a dud."
2,a collosal disappointment,"i was so disappointed when i read WHAT LOOKS LIKE CRAZY ON AN ORDINARY DAY. the title and first few pages intrigued me. the language flowed so smoothly and the premise was so unusual that i thought i would surly enjoy this book. and yet, after reading 50 pages, i put the book down and left it there; finally, dust mites became far more intimate with this book than i. i basically didn't care about the people, the situations, nothing. this work had so much POTENTIAL, but the characters seemed contrived and the plot line strained. i have only tossed aside three books due to lack of interest or poor writing. this, sadly, was one. still, the author's interesting voice saved this review from receiving only one star."
1,What kind of retarded name is that? huh?,"This book, bieng a member of Oprah's Book Club, is only suitable for starting fires. I would not read it if you paid me. Oprah should go away and never come back. So there. (Feel free to sent all kinds of nasty hate mail. I like it.)"
1,A less than enjoyable read with little redeeming value,"Oprah needs to take her fingers out of publishing and find some other industry to invade. Her judgement of books is poor, at best. This book is processed sugar. Avoid it."
1,Pure garbage. Depressing. I found very little humor.,"When is Oprah going to recommend an uplifting story? Sorry. This book was boring, sad and empty."
4,Thoughtful,I enjoyed reading this selection. I found myself questioning if it is ever too late for a person to make a change in their life and find love. The characters touched me and I truly cared about their struggles.Good weekend read!
4,A Good Read,This was a really good read. A truely joyful book. A lovely story of sisterly love and more. Loved the characters. The only problem? It was too short.
3,Good Story,I could relate to this book on many levels. I could find similarities with my own sister to sister relationship where one is the stronger personality. I thought it was well written and made you feel for the characters.
4,I was expected something different,"It was very life like, the scenarios seemed very really, wish it could have been longer."
2,Very Disappointing,"I felt the character development was shallow and the real issues were breezed over. The sewing circus solutions seemed unrealistic and like they weren't dealing with the real issues at hand. I felt like I was reading someone's political views on teen pregnancy, abuse and HIV.....but that they weren't really ""dealt"" with in the novel to the extent I thought they could have been. My only favorite part was Ada's developing love story with Eddie...which was the ONLY reason I finished the book."
4,Encouraging,Thank you Ms. Cleage and Oprah! I thoroughly enjoyed reading this book from start to finish. I don't think its a literary masterpiece but it was definitely worth every moment of it. After reading it I felt enriched having met the characters . Even though it was a work of fiction its positive messages have stayed me ever since. So much so that while in the bookstore the other day I was encouraging complete strangers to buy copies. Its messages were so moving that I wanted to share them with as many people as possible.
4,"An all-too quick, but MOST enjoyable read","Unlike the masses, I did not pick up this book because Oprah said so... a co-worker was reading it, and could not stop raving. After finishing the book, I now know what the rave was about. I became totally caught up in life in Idlewild and with Ava's journey. Soon I found myself reading and laughing out loud (on a crowded NYC subway, no less). I have yet to pick up another novel, for fear of being disappointed. I look forward to more works from Ms. Cleage, her voice and humor are a welcome addition to my library."
5,This books was well written,"This is one of the best I've read in a long time I really and truely enjoyed this book, I weeped and laughed so hard and cryed and I've never cried doring a book in my life, But while reading this book I cried so hard."
4,"complex, but lightly written","What looks like crazy yada yada, is a book of complex but ordinary issues today. It explores living with HIV, the effects of the drug culture in black society, living with youthful widowhood and pedophilia among clergy lightly but with enough depth to start you thinking, but also offering up some real and workable solutions. Good book, I read it in about 2 1/2 hours."
4,"Surprised, but not surprised!","I couldn't put this book down; I felt drawn to the characters. It was recommended by a friend who had read it for her book club. I was familiar with some of Ms. Cleage's writings, primarily in Essence. What could have been a thoroughly depressing read, is, in the author's hands, a story of love, hope, and family--the good and the bad. It was a pleasure to read--funny and serious at the same time! A wonderful first novel, and I hope there are more to come."
2,Predictable and flat,"An amiable enough book, but it seemed flat, and most of the crises were entirely predictable. The three main characters were too good to be true, and the bad guys were ALL bad. Interesting that all were black, i.e., for once the enemy was not the white man. Empowerment a strong and inspiring theme. All in all, though, this seems to be written by number."
2,Not up to expectations,"After choosing this book because of the reviews, I was surprised when reading it. The characters though somewhat interesting were failed by choppy plotting and ill conceived situations as well as suffering from dull prose and dialogue. To top it off, this author seems to have spent little or no time in Michigan - did she think no one would notice when she moved her make believe town from one side of the state to the other - where was her editor????Very disapointing."
3,A Triumph of Person and Spirit,"Pearl Cleage gives us hope and the message that no one is beyond love though sometimes it comes when we are not looking and at the most in-opportune times.We cannot help but yearn for a love that is so admiredly pure and simple as is found in this novel.We all hope to find a companion that offers us the kind of spiritual,emotional and physical fulfillment as is nurtured here.And we cannot forget the sisterly love that is at the heart of this uplifting tale of love,hope,past mistakes and the human bond we all wish to share."
1,I could not get through it!,This book was not stimulating in any way. I am an avid reader and this is only the second book in my 28 years of life that I could not finish. Don't waste your money or your time!
1,You've Got To Be Kidding,"391 reviews and this book averages 4 stars??? Give me a break. The story is flat, predictable, and full of cliches. The way in which the 3 main characters are written just doesn't seem real, and that is why I found it hard to care about what happens to them. So, with only 50 pages left to the end, I put it down. Don't waste your money because this book is highly over-rated."
3,"somewhat simplistic, but enjoyable and heartwarming","Pearl Cleage writes a story of all-too-real modern characters who would normally be seen as tragic figures, the like seen everyday on talk shows. Instead of playing out a standard tragic fate, her characters find peace and happiness through self-discovery and helping others. While the story is written a bit too simplistically, it is upbeat and a fast read. Also infused with touches of humor, I found myself smiling while reading much of the book."
3,It was just all right,"The book was okay, but it could have been better. It was interesting but at times seemed to drag on. There were a few times that I was tempted to just put it down and move on to another book. To me, it seemed there was just too much going on. Maybe that's why the characters weren't as strongly developed as they should have been. I would have been very interested in hearing more about the families of Tyrone, Frankie and his girl friend. Knowing their history probably would have made it much more than just a good guy vs. bad guy novel. Also part of what happened at the end, although slightly believable, seemed to occur much too quickly to be considered anything other than convenient. I must say though, that the situation did make me want to keep reading to find out what was going to happen."
3,"Very enjoyable, entertaining and clever","While this was not the best piece of fiction I have read, I nonetheless found it very easy to read, enjoyable and witty. I enjoyed the characters, although the author could have developed them more. I loved the humor. It was a fast read. I would be interested in reading more of the author's work and will keep an eye out for a second novel."
1,"POORLY WRITTEN, SHALLOW CHARACTERS, ABSURD PLOT","I realize this is Ms. Cleage's first novel, but I would suggest she stick with playwriting. When the idealistic heriones (Joyce, Eddie, Ava) suggested possibly hurting or killing the two troubled teenage boys (Frank & Tyrone), I was appalled. Even though their intent was not made specifically clear, my take on it was that they were tentatively planning to murder those boys! If this should even be fictionally stated that this is how the black community deal with their own, let's just pray that a white supremist not get hold of this book!! Considering violence against children (even fictionally) is scary. Obviously we have problems as a society but when the good guys start talking about hurting children, I cannot believe that things have become so distorted. Sorry Oprah, I will have to go back to friends and associates recommending my reading material."
4,"down-to-Earth, fun read. Great way to spend an afternoon...","I found this book to be witty, funny, and touching. Although the author writes from an African-American perspective, I found it applicable to every culture and small town."
4,Great Read,"Thoughtful and well-written. I read it at the airport during a long layover. Even though my attention span in noisy, crowded places is short, I was mesmerized by the characters and their individual stories."
3,"An OK read, but not the best.","""What Looks Like Crazy"".... is supposedly a great book. I didn't think it was too great. Sure, it was easy reading, but it was not very interesting. It took me longer to read than most books. Ava was a character who you almost felt sorry for, but something held you back. I did however like the character of Eddie. He was described to a ""T"" and was in my opinion the best character in the book."
2,This book lacked substance.,This was light reading in every respects. The story line was good but the book went no where. The reader needs more! Oprah's book selections have got to get better.
4,It's not a death AIDS story. It's a LIFE aids story.,"I expected a depressing story about a lonely young black woman and her lost love and family. Instead, I enjoyed a story about 2 sisters appreciating each other and some very strong love relationships. I'm glad Oprah suggested this book. I would never have read it otherwise"
5,"Amazing, by Far the Absolute Best Book Ever Written","I have never enjoyed reading a book this much. My mother, grandmother and I all read it and it reaches out to all people and all generations. I've read it three times and it's still wonderful."
4,Sometimes real life reads like a fiction book,"I read the book in about a day and felt lots of compassion for all characters. I chose to focus of the love story aspect of the book. All of us know of a couple who despite so many odds meet and really find love. Despite all of the sadness in the book, teenage pregnancy, AIDs, and substance the book ended on a good note."
3,It was okay.,"It was an okay read, certainly not one of my favorites. I didn't think it had much substance or that it had much of a story line. At times it was light hearted and I liked that. I thought it had a good ending."
5,"Excellent reading. Warm, funny, and real","This was one of the best books I've read this summer. It had heart, and it allowed you to feel the pain, laughter, and sadness of everyone. The book also shows how a small town have all of the big town problems. Please everyone, pick up a copy and read."
4,Good story,"I normally try to avoid the Oprah pics because I found that they have a tendency to be very depressing. But I found this one at a second hand bookstore and since I was desperate for a book to read, I decided - why not? And I was pleasantly surprised. This turned out to be a really nice story of a woman coming to terms with her HIV status and finding a new life. The characters quickly became my friends and I read the book in a day!Oprah fans or not, you should read this one!"
4,"An honest, thought provoking look at HIV","This book gives one the feel of finding someones diary and secretly reading each page. Thoughts, feelings, and ideas are expressed candidly and as such, beckons the reader to want to know more about this character. This is an excellent read."
4,This book was like a vacation: short but worth the trip!,This was the first book that I read where I wanted a highlighter! Pearl's writing was fantastic: both catchy and original. She made Idlewood as well as the residents of this small town more interesting than any big city! She also made living with HIV more real for those unfamiliar with it's effects. I highly recommend it to anyone who enjoys reading comprehensive socio-political fast-paced stories told well!
2,There's just not enough there...,"to appreciate the characters in this book. I was told there would be moments in this book where I would ""laugh out loud."" That didn't happen. Fortunately, the book was short but unfortunately, it may have been better if the characters had been developed better."
4,I wanted more after I finished reading the last page.,"I am very familar with Pearl Cleage writings, this is one lady that writes from examples of life experiences. After reading this book I didn't want to image that I could have been Ada living through this horrific situation. Honestly speaking Ms. Cleage did a wonderful job of expressing a black man and black woman having a beautiful relationship, over coming insercurities and keeping the lines of communications flowing."
2,A disappointment,"Despite the occasional pithy vernacular, I found the writing of this book to be stilted and ungraceful. The author spells out every thought, every emotion -- as though the reader has no imagination! Perhaps this is because Ms. Cleage is primarily a playwright, and therefore cannot rely on actors to explain the characters' sentiments. There is nothing subtle about this book. Predictable characters, cliche ending. I was disappointed, and happy to see it come to an end."
3,Full of Simple Pleasures,"I really enjoyed this book. I actually found myself smiling while reading it. It wasn't a profound statement in African-American literature, but it examined life's problems on a much smaller scale. Perhaps the most difficult thing about this book was the sudden shifts in moods. Cleage contradicted herself when she took peaceful-tai chi practicing Eddie and made him quickly revert back to his old ways and want to kill Frank. I found that to be a little off. Other than that it was a fun book that put a smile on my face. I look forward to more light-hearted writing from Cleage."
2,"Not a bad book, but....","I wasn't impressed with this book at all. I read the book after reading positive reviews here, but I was pretty disappointed. I don't know, maybe I was looking a little more depth to the story. I finished the book and was left wondering ""That's it?"" The story is about a woman w/HIV, so I thought it'd be an ""issue book w/a msg"", but the storyline was very simple. Not boring or bad, just simple."
2,Void of substance and throughly unrealistic,"I will give the author the benefit of the doubt, because making the switch from playwright to fiction author is very difficult, however, Every thing about this story was totally unrealistic. One would assume that to choose a subject like AIDS, one must have something to say, or some kind of commentary to make. She made none. Ava was as passive about her disease as if she had the flu. Some aspects of the story had over explination, while most didn't have nearly enough. Her concepts did not flow in one seemless motion, they were broken and sporatic. I had met Eddie in a hundred other books before this one. It was cliche, predictable and a chore to read. The characters were underdeveloped. This is a much longer story that the author made it. With some pratice however, she just might make a significant literary contribution."
4,I CAN'T BELIEVE I READ THE WHOLE THING!!!!!!!!,"One word...pure entertainment! The irony around which I read this book is disturbing. While stuck in a funeral home for 2 hours and 45 minutes, Cleage's book took me out of a dark situation and warmed me up with her funshine!! Thank you, Cleage! My family thanks you. Through my laughter, I was able to brighten up a gloomy situation. Looking forward to your next adventure!!!! ...In memory of Emma..."
4,"Funny, serious and unexpected.",I found this book very entertaining. I loved her writing style she shocked you right off the bat with the language. I found myself cheering on the good guys and glad to see the preachers wife put in her place. Things aren't always as they appear. And I loved Eddie!!!!!
2,Soporific,It was hard for me to get into the story because it never really went anywhere. I was unable to feel empathy for the characters because it never got to the point where I actually cared about them. They were faceless blurs on a page with bad histories that never were quite redeemed.
3,There's more to this author than she shared in this book,"I felt cheated by the author. It seems to have pulled all the trite punches in order to market itself: in-your-face ethnicity (at the expense of the language); AIDS; violence; sexual abuse; spritualism --- and it never really plumbed the depths of the central character, a woman I found quite fascinating. I didn't get to know her and her sister as much as I wanted to. I felt like the author put certain things in this book to attract Oprah's book club and more sucessfully market her books. I'd like to hear more of this writer's true voice -- when she's got her eye just on the story and not on shelf space."
2,Over-rated,"Interesting but sorely under developed characters; plot is predictable, contrived, and cliche."
4,Interesting,"This is one of the first books I've read about a character with HIV. There should be more stories about the pain of HIV sufferers. I think this book is a good attempt, but not a must read."
4,"Sensitive subject, honest writing","This book discusses a very sensitive subject, AIDS, from a humerous and honest point of view and kept me laughing and crying along with the characters. I felt these people were friends of mine and really spoke their mind, rather than edited thoughts.This black family reunited in a difficult time pulls through, together."
5,one of the best books I have ever read,"This book is so wonderful. Halfway through the book, I found myself looking furtively toward the end, not wanting to spoil the ending for myself but at the same time wanting to ensure that nothing horrible would happen to characters who already felt like dear friends. And I think that Eddie, even with his dark side, is just about the most perfect man I have ever heard of; I just really hope he (or some reasonable facsimile thereof) actually exists somewhere!"
4,The Sun Will Come Out Tomorrow!,"This book was refreshing. Even in the midst of sadness and neverending drama, there is so much hope!"
4,Great read!,"If you enjoy history or just want a good book to read, this is the one. Exciting scenarios and great plot lines give this book 4 stars."
4,Pretty darn amusing,I admit that this thing seemed idiotic when my son said he wanted it but I have to be honest - this ended up being very entertaining. It totally looks like you are making the card whirl and spin with no strings. I was impressed with it. We bought it some time ago and the thing is nearly worn out from being played with day in and day out. I would say we got our money worth. It was amusing and fun to watch the tricks being done.
2,What's All the Excitement About???,"Both the performances and the technical quality of the recording are good with one glaring exception for the latter. The horns are somewhat muffeled and the cymbals are practically non-existant. The high end just isn't there. Very disappointing. I'm not surprised, though, given that it's a Telarc, the most over rated record label out there."
5,Blockbuster demo disk!,The Telarc label does it again. This is the perfect disk for showing off your sound system. Great recordings and great selection of overtures. I've been listening to this CD for about 15 years now and the Orpheus in the Underworld track still sends chills up my spine.
4,Q and the Borg,"While on a routine mission in deep space, captain Picard and crew encounter the powerful super-entity Q.This time around Q wants to join the Enterprise crew.After having his request denied,Q decides to teach the crew a lesson: he sends the Enterprise hundreds of light-years across the galaxy to the uncharted sector J-25. It is not long before the crew encounters a powerful race of machines known as the Borg. The Enterprise is nearly destroyed but Q intervenes in the nick of time. However the lesson is plainly obvious:there are some things in outer space humanity is not prepared for,but Picard knows the Borg will return. This is one of the better episodes of the second season and serves as a prequel to season three's THE BEST OF BOTH WORLDS.This episode has everything:Action, humor,drama and serious discussion on the human condition.I heartily recommend that everyone interested in good science fiction buy this video."
4,Memories of Broadway solidified,"We were fortunate to see the first preview on Broadway of ""A Tale of Two Cities"" in August 2008. To view this concert version brings back such wonderful memories of a superb cast and recall the magnificent staging. I remember sobbing tears of sadness in the final 20 minutes of this production and it had the same effect as I watched this DVD. Such a wonderful piece of music and singing. Thank you so much for recording this concert. On another note, I hope a film company will film ""The Mystery of Edwin Drood"" with all optional endings."
2,So & so...,"If you expect something as good as the ""In Concert"" productions such as CHESS or LES MISERABLES, you'd better think it twice. Voices are wonderful; yet, the production is average, Mr. Michael York's comments throughout the whole concert on the events that are supposed to happen on stage (but you don't see) are quite disappointing. The point is that you don't have the whole production: it's a sort of sypnopsis of the play which include some of the best songs but, in general, it lacks the splendour and magnificence of previous ""in concert"" productions. In other words, it looks to me as something rather poor. Not really impressive, really."
4,"Very good, but remember, it's a concert","This concert reminded me of the Tenth Anniversary Concert of Les Miserables. The actors are amazing, but it isn't the complete musical. That being said, it still moved me to tears a couple of times because of the superb way the actors (James Barbour in particular) play their roles."
3,poor quality control,"The pot is satisfactory for cooking . However , there are multiple vertical cracks along the flared edge of the rim ."
3,a subtle movie with Gosset and Mazzello,"I just bought this movie after I had seen it on tv. So why buy it? Well I guess it was because of the actors delivering a good performance; Gossett jr. and Mazzello are a safe choice to get energy in the film. This movie tells the story of a small boy who has a hard time getting raised by a father who isn't to keen on black people, let's call him a racist. This reflects on the boy at first but after some dramatic moments he has the insight that blacks are people just like everybody else. The storyline is very thin, but Joseph Mazzello and Louis Gossett jr. lift the film to a good level. Mazzello is adoring in his sorrow and hope. Gossett is a kewl adult, who teaches a kid the basic elements of fatherly love. The film would do a great job on schools as an introduction to prejudice and biggotism. So I guess I can recommend this film to anyone who cares."
1,False advertising,"Thought this would be great, but there were no animals in the animal fun box, no kids in the kid pack box, and the fun pack box just contained small copies of the other two boxes."
3,Some chick lit,"It's about Megan Ismore, her husband Matt, and their nutty families. In the beginning Megan is freaking out because she thinks she might be pregnant. She's in her late 20's, hasn't completed college yet, and is in no way ready to start a family. Matt and her discussed having children in the past and agreed to wait on having kids.What bothers me is how repetitive it is. Every other page shows Megan 'freaking out' and stressing about whether or not she could be pregnant. Sure, I can relate because I don't want children. That's the only reason why I wasn't completely bored with the book.The parts with Megan's family were funny because they have this babbling and arguing thing going on that is so realistic. It reminded me of my family at get togethers.Overall, a great book to read to pass the time."
1,A Dreary Read,"Just when I thought I'd found a great, funny read, it all turned awful. Wendy French has the ability to characterize family members and capture humor on paper. However, this book is bona fide chick lit, pure and simple, and chick lit is NOT the place to tackle the whole abortion issue. I felt like I was reading some sort of bi-polar adventure where everyone's interactions are funny and escapist, but the real plot of the story is dark, anxious, and offensive. I bought this book for a bridal shower gift -- Thank goodness I read a library copy first. It'd be the last thing I'd want to give an otherwise happy bride."
4,size information not in online description,"I purchased the fannypacks for my 5 and 3 year old grandchildren. Since they are called ""kids,"" I thought that they would be child-size. However, when they arrived I discovered that they are made for adolescents, requiring the belt to be shortened several inches for our family's use. In fact, the tag says ""intended for children 8 and over."" It would have been helpful if that information had been included in the online description. Having a pouch for a drink bottle is a good feature, and the quality is good. The size is just larger than the online info implies."
2,Too big for my kids,"Neat little waist pack, but still much too big for my boys, ages 3, 5, and 7. Advertised as a child size one, but straps were way too long to fit any of them snugly, and even if they did, it was still too bulky. None of mine wanted to wear it saying it was annoying and uncomfortable. We went with child-size Camelbak hydration backpacks instead (found online at a good price). They can wear on hikes and bike rides and never complain about wearing them."

3,Review of Samatha and the Cowboy,"This is an excellent book for teenagers. Lorraine Heath is a very good author. I am an adult so I was very much over the age of the suggested reader. However, I thought it was well written and interesting, but would most likely not read it again. I encourage anybody to ready Lorraine Heath's adult romances, especially Texas Destiny, that one is the very best!"
3,Nice Story,"Story about a girl becoming a strong and independent woman. Definitely a G-rated story, but with all the romance in place."
3,So-so,"It was an OK read, thanks to the fleshed out characterization and semi-intriguing plot. The only off thing to it was the turn of events near the climax. What is supposed to be a horror yarn becomes an action-adventure novel with grenades and shotguns as center stage. In the end, WINTER SCREAM may not be that scary to begin with but has a narrative strong enough for a quick read visit.-----Martin Boucher"
3,International corporation hi-jinks,"Three reasons to rent (or buy) this movie are: Carol Alt, Alexandra Paul and Lauren Hutton. Two former supermodels and a Baywatch Babe to boot!The plot is not that great. Billy Zane plays a rich young heir and stockholder in an international company who wheels and deals his way to increase his fortune, stabbing other family members in the back. He crosses paths (and bedsheets) with several women, among them the married Alexandra Paul and Zane's hot nightclubbing cousin, Carol Alt.Don't expect too much. Aside from some European vistas and bed-hopping, it was a bore. It reminded me of a Judith Krantz novel. Maybe it was?"
3,Ten tousan' lira make-a half-a dollah,"PD purveyor TGG DIRECT offers reliable DVD transfers of unrestored films at bargain prices. Some extras are included but what's NOT here are any annoying on-screen company watermarks..The original Italian name of MILLIONS was ""Millardi.""""Money is the root of all evil"" is the message here. Billy Zane plays the avaricious nephew of Leo Feretti (Sorel), a globetrotting financier who's now in failing health. When not maneuvering in every underhanded way imaginable to capture his still-breathing uncle's fortune, the immature Zane acts upon massive satyric impulses with a bevy of bellissima bambini.Idyllic locations and beautiful but unlikeable people can't redeem this Continental-style soap opera..Parenthetical number preceding title is a 1 to 10 IMDb viewer poll rating.(3.8) Millions (Italy-1991) - Billy Zane/Lauren Hutton/Carol Alt/Jean Sorel/Alexandra Paul/Catherine Hickland/John Stockwell/Ben Hammer/Michael Lombard/Donald Pleasence"
4,King Arthur and his Knights,I liked the book because I like learning about theMiddleAges. People that like the Middle Ages should read this book.
4,Wonderful fusion of technology and the religious imagination,"Erik Davis has long been a pioneer of the borderline between religious and spiritual imaginative systems and technological inventions. In Techgnosis he focuses on information technologies through the ages and shows us how various infomrations systems have become powerful loci for religious and spiritual dreams. Beginning with the word itself Davis brilliantly explores the magical, mystical, spiritual appeal of symbols and codes, and the various technologies invented for transmitting them. Revealing the hidden hermetic underbelly of the Western technological enterprise, Davis offers us a thoughtful and insightful look at how electricity and silicon have become powerful loci for new forms of mysticism. Engaging, witty, and always highly opinionated, Davis is a rare and welcome voice in the new technology scene. Techgnosis will inform, enchant, amuse, and at times probably annoy you - but it will never bore you!"
2,Too many made up words,"I felt that this was one of the worst books I've ever read, mostly because the author either said things that were already very evident or seemed made up. He created a lot of hybrid words that seemed funny at first, but got very annoying as the book went on."
1,HEI,"Just awful. The first video is a ""Three Stooges"" approach to water safety. Important water safety points are discussed, but they get lost in the slap-stick comedy routines. The second video would be great to show 6-8 year olds that are going fishing for the first time, but has very little value beyond that age group. Suggest you do not waste your money as I did on this video."
3,Graphic SF Reader,"A strange idea for a book, this one, mostly probably an excuse for another justice league story to keep some fans happy.In the middle of the whole Hal Jordan hoo-hah, he comes back to help the JLA save the earth from one of those big bad menaces, knowing full well what he will become.Mistrust and action follow."
3,Earth's Final Night Is Thrilling!,"A spacecraft comes to warn Earth of the Sun Eater is coming to drain the Sun's energy and heat ready to leave Earth lifeless. The worlds greatest heroes try to destroy the Sun-Eatter. Even Superman, who fought it in Time And Time Again can't stop it. Death looms on as Hal Jordans returns to Earth to destroy the Sun- Eatter. Earth's Final Night is here!"
4,Hal is saved for the ending,"Basic Storyline is that the Earths sun is getting sucked up by an alien species. No matter what the planets super heros seem to do they cant stop it. Near the end Kyle finds Hal (Parallax) near the end of the universe and asked him to save his home planet. After doing some sould searching Hal decides to help, but in the end must give all the energy he has to do it. Killing himself to save a planet full of those who see him as a murderer. A great way to end the life of Hal Jordan, the greatest Green Lantern."
1,magic my ars.,"C R A P. Doesn't stick, peel off adhesive doesn't peel off. Just a really bad product. Duct tape would do the job better."
2,Not what I expected,"While the other reviews think Moving Breath She Changes is wonderful, I do not. I listen mainly to New Age music and of all my CD's this is my least favorite. This CD seems to be lacking something. The music seems to be very simple and unimaginative. If you are looking for music to inspire and take you to another place don't get this one. The only inspiration I got from this CD was to write a review of how awful this CD was."
5,"Hard to find, but well worth the effort","I was first introduced to ""She Changes"" a few years ago by a good friend, and I was instantly captivated. The music is entrancing and moving, but it is also very singable -- it's almost impossible not to chant along with the vocals!The CD contains not only self-composed pieces by Moving Breath, but also some beautiful renditions of traditional favorites. There is something here for the lover of Celtic music as well as Native American inspired tracks and songs from other cultures around the world.I would recommend this to anyone who enjoys good Pagan chants, although the CD is definitely geared toward the Goddess. It makes great meditation music as well."
4,Great songs for ritual or groups!,"I just love this CD! First let me say it's not a ""music"" CD per se. As one reviewer says the music is very simple. To me, this is the perfect CD to learn some songs, take them to your group and sing at ritual. Many of the songs repeat verse, similar to a chant or mantra. So if you're looking for new age Enya or Lorrena McKennitt, this isn't it. If you're looking for something to to add to your sing alongs, public rituals, etc. this is great! Several of the songs can be sung as rounds too which makes it fun!"
4,No problems,This CD came promptly and I didn't have any problems with it. It plays well and it is what I wanted.
2,Not reliable,"People who complain that the thermometer consistently measures 96 to 97 degrees instead of 98.6 are mistaken in how the body works. Not everyone measures 98.6. However, that being said, this thermometer is still consistently inaccurate. When I try it on my daughter it consistently comes up 92 to 93 degrees, and I know for a fact that is NOT normal. I am going to look into another brand to see if I can find one that is much more reliable."
1,sleepy drive,"I bought this drive for photo/data storage but also as an media drive for recording music/video. I spend a lot of time working and saving, and this drive goes to sleep and takes 10 seconds to wake up. Sometimes it hangs longer when I'm trying to record audio with Gigastudio, whether I'm using the USB2 or Firewire connection. I emailed Seagate tech support, and this was the response: ""Unfortunately Seagate drives have a sleep function built into them that is set for between 5-15min of not being in use. There is also no way to remove this function."" So now I know. I researched this drive before buying, and I saw nothing about this in the literature. I will definitely purchase a different brand next time."
2,Mneh,"I've had trouble ""safely removing"" this drive after back-up. If they provide dire warnings about the consequnces of not safely removing, they should make it easier to safely remove it. Technical support was not much help, telling me that to safely remove it, virus protection has to be disabled, and printers, too, and then getting impatient with me when I wondered why that should be necessary.Wouldn't buy it again."
4,Great quiet drive,"This is a wonderful drive for the money with a dual firewire/USB interface. I'm using this with a Mac Mini with firewire. It's quiet, stackable, and pretty quick. I had to knock off half a star for some design deficiencies. Two grumbles - I cannot power this on and off through an external switch, such as a power distribution center. The drive has a combination on/off and click-backup switch which always comes up in the ""power off"" state. That's a minor annoyance. The second annoyance is that the firewire pass-through only operates while the drive in powered up. So, unless you have your drive up all the time, you will loose a firewire port for no good reason. Short of that - great drive for the money and I'm happy with it."
5,"Great Buy--- no problems, easy to use","I purchased the Seagate hard drive to back up my Macbook which was acting up. It has been great, the software is easy to use and, after the first time, backs up the information quickly with firewire. The information is also easy to access just as if it were an internal drive. I have not needed to use the restore feature yet, and hopefully won't have to, but so far I would highly recommend it."
5,"easy to use, nice","This is my first external hard drive, and so far I am extremely impressed. It is extremely simple to use and install, and seems to be of good quality. I recommend it because it works well, is cheap, and is a Seagate, which is THE name in hard drives, or so I have heard."
3,It's ok... but maybe you should look harder,"I have been using this drive for the last three months pretty intensely for video editing. It has never crashed or had any problems, but it does seem to stop spinning if you arn't actively using it. It will start spinning again once you access a file, but it takes a moment to get going. Also, it is made of pretty cheap plastic that feels somewhat flimsy. I think it does the trick for the most part... it just doesn't feel like it will last forever. It's cheaper for a reason.-Kenny"
1,compatibilty issues,"This unit worked fine with my old gateway pc, however, my new dell pc was not compatible with one button back up software. have to do it manually. Pray to God that you never have to call Seagate for Tech. Support. I was on hold for over an hour. They did not fix the bugs. They emailed me a bogus link for a different version software. I gave up. Will continue to manually back up my files."
1,Don't buy this Seagate drive,"Here are the issues :1. Backup software is just crap, with errors2. Disk is very noisy.3. Disk is slow in comparison to Western Digital with exactly the same speed and cache.But amazon is great, returning the item is more easier than regular store.I'm now a permanent customer of Amazon.comThanks"
1,Another failed Seagate,"The power dropped at my house during a storm and the Seagate external drive became corrupted. My Dell PC with Win XP SP2 will no longer recognize the drive. Seagate Tech support and their utilities were no help. I am buying a Hitachi, now."
2,Great Until It Fails! :(,"Bought this drive to back up my data on my MacBook--bought it because of the Seagate name. It's nice drive with a sturdy, if somewhat bulky, plastic enclosure, dual firewire 400 ports and one USB 2.0 port, an combo on/off/backup button on the front. Comes with thick cables and a power adapter.The drive worked fine for six months, but then failed. It powers on and spins up, but will not respond to the power button and won't mount--just makes a spinning sound with occasional pauses, so none of my recovery software can see it.The drive has a power-saving mode that you can not disable--goes to sleep after 10 minutes or so. Unfortunately, the power light goes off too so you can't tell if it's still running, then it takes a few seconds to come back on when you try to access the drive. Good for the environment, bad for my workflow.Guess I need a back-up for my back-up. :("
4,Great Dynamic Range ... Good Selections,"This older CD offers the true ""Pure Digital"" audio potential of CD's.One can easily destroy an expensive speaker system using some of the selections provided.So... keep your levels low the first time around.You will enjoy this offering!Cheers,JC"
5,Works great and no grit.,"The Smooth version is not available locally so I was happy to find it available at Amazon. Works on grease, tar, paint, oil-pretty much everything I've thrown at it. The Pumice version is good too, but can get irritating if used 10 times a day and I don't like using it if I'm going to work on machines that would be damaged by the residual grit."
5,Love The Smooth !!,"I use a lot of hand cleaners around the shop, but hate the pumice types because of the gritty feeling. The Fast Orange cleans better than the smooth GoJo, especially for paints."
5,Work well,"I was searching for this stuff to be pumice free, for using it to clean the hood filters. This avoid clocking the sink drain with all pumice from the other, and by using a small not too soft brash, it works well.George"
4,Good guide but it should be updated.,"I have been diving out of this book for about three years. I have found that several of the springs mentioned in the ""panhandle"" area have been closed. I fell in love with the Florida springs system from the first moment and was somewhat dismayed that all of the entries in the book were not available for diving. I have spent countless hours and a lot of money on long distance phone calls trying to determine what was open and ""diveable"". Anyone wanting to avoid the same pitfalls may contact me for information on specific springs in that area. I have not, by any means, been through them all, but the ones I have called on, I will share with you. Happy diving, Frogman at (palmers68@aol.com.)"
2,GPS Coordinates wrong....,I have never found one of the sites listed in this book. Very upset at the wasted time on sandy bottoms.Don't buy.
2,Useless GPS Coordinates,"Though I am a cavern diver, I have not tried to use this book for this purpose. I have tried to use it for finding dive sites in SE Florida. In this regard, the book is nearly useless. Many (if not most) of the GPS coordinates provided are just plain wrong. Obviously the author is relying on outdated (at best) or totally unreliable third party information. I frankly doubt that the author has ever been to most of the SE Florida open water dive sites written up in this book. This book is a waste of money for open water divers."
2,Boring,This is a very boring book. I guess I am somewhat surprised because it was written by A.W. Tozer. I do not recommend this book. Save your money and read about Robert Jaffray somewhere else.
4,Walcott is an interesting writer,"This was required for a theatre class. To get the full gist of this play you need to research African roots, myths, and superstitions. I Enjoyed it."
5,Makes slicing baglels easy!,This is one of the most simple products of its type that I know of! All you have to do is stick the bagle in the slot and push down on the blade. Also pretty good for lettuce and other foodstuffs. Not for irritable psycotics.
5,BUY IT,I live in southern california and am fortunate enough to be able to camp outside pretty much all year around.This provides me the same cushion as a mattress.I use this on the Teton XXL Cot and sleep like a baby. With the Quick Tent. Would be just as good on the ground too. No cot.Spend the extra money on this. Great for over night guests as well.Not great for back packing. Thing is a monster.
4,Works well,"I got this with the Teton XXL Camp Cot. The pad is comfortable. My sleeping bag doesn't slide around on it. It also lessens the tendency of the cot to ""hammock."" I am glad that I bought it."
5,great cot pad,This is the greastest cot pat you could ever offer anyone to buy. And it is very well worth the money and if I had more money I would of gotten another cot and pad for my X-Wife so she could sleep better.
1,size is not as advertised,"This is a great cot pad but do not be fooled by the stated size. After checking the other sites against my own measurements, this pad is 82 x 38 x 2.5. I bought this because they claimed it was bigger. Very disappointing."
5,Twin bed sized Cot Pad for motorized supported camping.,"This thing is HUGE, it is designed for an XLong twin bed or xxl cot. It comes with straps that you can roll up and secure the pad with. I bought it before I bought the cot and tried it out. Not bad, not bad at all, a good emergency bed. More comfortable than the cotton filled thingies. A blanket and a sleeping bag liner are you need in the house, or an adjustable warmth sleeping system, and you too can wake up at 5 am, and say, ""WHY! WHY? Did I ever agree to this fiasco?"
3,Works fine for what it was designed for . . .,"I own the Teton XXL cot and purchased this for a dual purpose - to add luxury to the cot, and use as a sleeping pad on the ground. The pad works well for it's designed purpose on the cot, with the exception that it absorbs moisture (it IS foam, after all). I recently took it with me on a camping trip and left the cot home due to space issues. The pad was just OK as a ground pad. It tended to flatten out in certain areas and ended up creating pressure points that became uncomfortable. When combined with the cot, it makes a pretty comfortable temporary bed . . .I wouldn't want to sleep on it every night. Also after a couple of nights, it needs to be dried out - it absorbs significant moisturePros:Makes the Teton XXL cot very comfortableCons:overpricedAbsorbs moisturetends to flatten out at pressure points"
3,cot pad,good product. For the price i paid I could have looked elsewhere. So take some time to shop around first.
2,Careful,The ad looks as if you are purchasing the cot and the pad but you are only purchasing the pad. The pad tends to conform to your body so after a few nights you have no padding. There were several other deals that were priced better and may preform better.
4,fun for little ones,I bought this item for my son's 2nd birthday. He was thrilled and is still thrilled at almost age 4 with watching the castle inflate and deflate so quickly. The kids ( ages 3 and 6) love the bright colors. They really enjoy bouncing for a short period of time. It does not hold their interest for hours. I find they are excited - jump a a while- then leave to play something else and then come back to the castle. I found the item very sturdy and durable. The blower works great. A quality toy. I just wish we lived somewhere I could use it all year long and didn't have to put the item away. Rolling it up and putting it back in the carrier is a pain.
4,Lots of fun!!!,"My 2 year old daughter is having a great time. She is very tall for her age, I wouldn't recommend for a small 2 year old. Bounce is great. Super easy to inflate, takes only about 45 seconds and clean up is easy as well. If you have a child who likes to jump this a great toy."
5,Bounce 'Round is all around fun!,"Though it is not big enough and durable enough for adults to jump, the Bounce 'Round was cheaper than renting one in the end. We have higher ceilings the basement, so we can set it up down there for bad weather fun. It is not difficult to move around, though, so it is easy to set back up outside too. The castle does blow up quickly, as advertised, and seems quite durable so far. (We also make sure no shoes or pointy toys go in there) The castle has been toddler heaven...super fun and wears out even our active 2 year old!"
5,money well spent,"We bought this toy for christmas for our very energetic boys (6-,4-,1-year-old)...hoping to help them burn off energy during the long winter. The older two say it is their favorite xmas present. They have so much fun jumping in it. It is also so convenient...easy to set up and take down, and it fits in our playroom. Quality seems good...try as they might, they haven't been able to tip it over (they try jumping into the walls and corners) or damage it in any way so far!"
2,NOT a 9 foot jumping room,"I am EXTREMELY disappointed with my purchase of the Bounce 'round Deluxe Castle. I bought this for my 2 year old's birthday party. The online description AND the box reads 9' X 9' jumping room. This castle is NOT 9' X 9'. I am 5'4"" and when I lay in the castle my head touches one end and my feet the other. The jumping area is not that big and even from edge to edge (of the base) is still NOT 9 feet. I feel this bounce 'round is misrepresented. I will be returning this tomorrow. The only thing I can see good about this toy would be if you were buying it to use in your house or outside with 1 or 2 kids. Any more then that and you will have some major crashing going on!"
5,Best $200 ever spent,I read all the reviews about this and couldn't wait to get it. My kids love it and so do all of their friends. I have two boys. Two and a half and 11 months. They both love it. The secret to fitting it in the bag is to fold it in half and then half again. Then I lay my dining room table chairs on it over night to get all the air out. Then my husband rolls it up real tight. The bounce house fits in my front room and comes to about an inch from our ceiling. We only use it a couple times a month because you can definitely see it on the electric bill but it really wears my 2.5 year old out.
5,Great Books,I now own 4 of Addo Stuur books. These books have been the greatest of help to me. I like the idea that he goes step by step and shows you what the screen should look like.
3,"Interesting Material, Boring Presentation","Although I found the subject matter of this book to be extremely interesting, I thought that the author's writing style was dry and boring. It was difficult for me to get through an entire chapter without falling asleep. His thesis was rather unclear, so I also had trouble trying to figure out just what point he was arguing. Of course, it's the only book like it that I've been able to find as of yet - so he definitely gets credit for originality."
5,Well Written Mystery,"Equine insurance agent Connie Holt has a tough job on her hands when she's called out on what looks like the accidental death of a prize stallion. Before long, Connie is stumped by two more deaths, and the horrible suspicion that someone is murdering these animals for money.Making her job more difficult is handsome veterinarian, Jase Tyree. Connie's emotions must be buried as she works side-by-side with her former love. Level-headed, detailed investigation takes her deeper and deeper into the intrigue of ruthless horse owners who play to win, and provides Connie with a heart-wrenching confrontation with the truth.A hold-your-breath read from beginning to end.Title and book cover fit the story; Ms. Fisher has developed the plot and structure well, drawn developed well-rounded, believable characters, and maintained the suspense throughout. I would recommend this book to anyone who loves a good mystery, and especially anyone who loves horses."
5,horsefeathers,"Marilyn Fisher has contrived to produce a combination of effects on the reader. Initially, it serves to provide excellent detail and insight into the complexity of the horse breeding and racing aspects of the area surrounding Lynchburg, VA. The importance of veteranarians and trainers is clearly demonstrated. At the same time, an intriguing ""whodunit"" type plot is interwoven to capture the reader's interest. The unexpected ending serves to provide both an exciting climax and, also, a stepping stone to future inquiry into a possible sequel. To add to all this, the character developement serves to provide the fill-in interest, making the whole piece of cloth. Altogether, a well rounded work capturing the reader's interest to the end."
5,Essential Pan For Every Kitch,"I have owned this lasagna pan for years. I have used it for everything, Mexican enchiladas, as a roasting pan and various baked noodle dishes. It bakes evenly and cleans up easily--even melted cheese. (I would recommend not using metal utensils because you could scratch the surface. My ex-mother-in-law put a deep scratch in mine, but it still bakes perfectly.)I love this pan so much I'm buying a second one.Also,I like that this pan is manufactured in the USA by Wisconsin Aluminum Foundry."
4,More than the trail,"You don't have to just hike the Appalacian trail if you visit the Smokey Mountain National Park....and this book proves it. Packed with information about the parks and it's trails and non-trail hiking, it's a good book to pack for that vacation you are taking to the area. For day hikes, overnight hikes, or thru hikes of the area, this is a good resource."
3,Anderson Piano Concerto Tuneful and Upbeat,"I enjoyed the Anderson Piano Concerto. It is tuneful and upbeat. It has its moments of technical prowess, but I thought the pianist hit a lot of wrong notes which upon repeat listening, causes annoyance.I would like to hear another recording with a better pianist, or at least one that is edited. It is too good a concerto to get this rendering."
3,Treasury of Chinese Design motifs.,"Had expected more traditional designs from emperor's clothes and vases etc., Nevertheless a good selection. Useful for any design artist."
1,Terribly disappointing true crime novel!,"I am an absolute fan of the true crime genre, but this book takes the cake as the worst true crime book that I have read. The bulk of this book is spent criticizing (implicity and explicitly) the police and government - NOT for failing to stop a serial murderer, but for failing to give the author documents that he felt he was entitled to. Moreover, the sympathetic justifications for Wayne Ford's atrocities was a bit too much to bear.A true journalist would not let his own views taint the story that he is trying to tell. I don't think that I would rush to read another book by Carlton Smith anytime soon."
1,Huh?,"This was one of the worse true crime books I have read. Normally I do not feel the need to review books but in this case I am compelled because the book is based on nothingness. It repeatedly tells the reader that everything is under a gag order or deleted so there really is no story here.... just pages and pages of disclaimers and citations to motions that have had all the ""meat"" deleted. Kinda makes you go, huh?"
4,Good for converting theory to SPSS mechanics,"I've found this book extremely helpful in understanding how to set up the kinds of analysis in SPSS that I want to conduct. I have the theoretical understanding to design the experiment and know what analyses need to be conducted (and could do it by hand if I had to), but this books helps me understand how to efficiently analyze my data within the program itself. Of related books I have looked at, this is the best. The one drawback is that it is designed as a classroom tool with exercises and learning points and not for the professional user. That space could be used for more information and explanation."
1,A very passive educator/author,...This book should be labeled as a School or Classroom Edition and should not be sold publicly because it needs an instructor to guide you. The questions at the end of every chapter carry only a few answers to refer to. The author is not much help either and was so passive when I requested to be referred to the full answers to the questions saying that the reference for this is only for the instructors teaching the course.Individuals intending to buy this book for self-learning should think twice. ...
3,Cute but not a Care Guide,"If you want a cute book to read for entertainment and/or trivia this book is pretty good. If you are looking for a cae guide for your herps, this is not the book. I enjoyed parts of it but was expecting more health tips."
3,"ok, but not great","She obviously lacks first hand experince, and I feel thatt some of the sources she used were not that great. True, there is lots of stuff in it, most of it good info, but nothing you can't find eleswere. Also, does not do much to help you care for your snake."
2,Decent movie -- Horrid english dubbing,"The voice actors who dubbed this obviously didn't know what the characters were saying, they just made up stuff on the fly. Yes, the dialog is funny at times. However, this movie is about Wang Cong'er, a real-life Chinese heroine who became Supreme Commander of the Nine Armies of the White Lotus, and is the only movie about her I know of. Don't waste your money! Instead, buy the documentary produced by Lucy Lawless. More expensive, but you'll actually learn about this warrior. Google Wang Cong'er and you'll see what I mean."
2,Weak motor,The part fit as described but is very slow and annoying. I would return the product but that would require me to replace the product again. Don't waste your time and order from a different supplier.
4,"Good for learning the ""Inner Muir""","I wouldn't recommend this as a first book for those who are interested or curious about Muir (try _My First Summer in the Sierra_ or _1000 Mile Walk_), but it gives a lot of insight, for me at least, on why Muir turned out the way he did. He had a cruel, strict father and had to endure a lot of pain and hardship, which made his latter wilderness travels so much easier and free in comparison."
1,right packaging wrong product,The product would have been good if i would have got what i ordered. I ordered two sets of wiper blades from these guys when i went to put them on one set was two different wiper blades not even Anco blades. When i seen them i got so pissed off to put it mildly. It's such a pain in the A__ to return them that i didn't even bother calling the seller or anything. After cooling off somewhat i put them on well they were the sh__ s. one blade left streaks and didn't clean the windshield all that great. The other worked good for a cheap wiper blade not even the grade of wiper blade that i ordered. Well I'm not sure i even want to open and try the other set that i ordered. They are in the right package but so was the set that i opened. The other thing is that the picture on the add shows the whole blade (Arm and blade) very deceiving. All in All i would not recommend the product or the seller
1,misleading,"This is very misleading. It says whiper blade refill and that you get one and that it shows the metal part of the arm with it, you only get two blades per package. I am returning it because it is not what I ordered or thought I was ordering. Very disapointed."
4,"10 tracks, but 11 selections!","The first track on this CD is actually a combination of the first two ""tracks"" listed on Amazon's web page, joined one immediately after the other with no pause between them. Hence, there are actually ten physical tracks, not eleven. Why the manufacturer of the CD chose to do this is anyone's guess. This is also a source of confusion if you rip this CD using Windows Media Player or other services which list these tracks as separate entities when in fact they are not, causing all the tracks to be misnamed! Excellent duplication of the movie sound tracks, though. Better than the originals in the movies!"
1,Review of the Star Tracks CD,"I do not recommend buying this Star Tracks CD not because of the music contents but because of the poor recording on this CD. Telarc CD recording has been very disappointing again and again, and time after time. Most Telarc CD recordings are extremely flat, narrow and low soundstage, and is not lively at all. If you like the music contents of this CD and do not care about the flat sound, go for it. However, if you are a hifi audiophile and have an expensive hifi system at home, do not buy this Telarc CD."
2,"Jean Nate in name, but...","If this is the original formula for the After Bath Splash, it is watered down with something. It almost smells right - but not really. I have left the top off in hopes that evaporation will condense it down to the right fragrance. I used this product from 1960 to 2008-ish (when I could no longer find it), so I certainly know what I'm talking about. I would rather pay more for it and get the real thing."
1,Smells Nasty,I wanted a light citrus scent--this wasn't it. It went from one drop on my wrist to the trash can just that quick.
5,Intestinal Bowel Soother,"Haha. Funny writing a review on a product such as this, but I will try not to be too graphic.... This product is gentle and for any type of intestinal distress such as discomfort of the intestines---not just constipation---although it def. helps with that. I have a very sharp turn in my intestines that gets irritated occasionally and causes pain on my left side---bloating, etc. This product has helped trememdously. The company that makes it is very highly regarded, so I started taking it with no hesitations."
3,Not very well made,"This is a really flimsy toy. We only got it for my son's party because it had a castle and we wanted castle-themed games. It falls over easily.However, the kids do have fun with it."
3,Flimsy,"I like the two sided structure but it is really a piece of cardboard in a frame, the first time we used the beanbags with it, the picture popped out and does not fit back in correctly...should not be prices as high as it is being that it is not durable whatsoever."
5,Fine TV.,"I've owned this TV for more than 1 and 1/2 yrs now. So far, utterly pleased with this product. Swivel feature is very useful, where I can turn the screen almost 30 degrees whenever I change my viewing spot. I guess, no other brand comes with it. Watching HD-Channels is a treat. Colors are vivid.Buying an expensive electronics item from Amazon was a satisfying experience."
3,"Great deal, but somewhat disappointing picture","I was really impressed with the deal on this TV, and the delivery service was reliable and professional and courteous. I'm a bit disappointed with the picture quality, most notably on regular channels but also on high definition channels too. What I do not know yet is if it is my cable service, or if I just have not found the right settings on the picture settings of the TV, but either way I did not have the 'Wow' factor I expected with this, my first high definition TV."
5,Best of the best,"This TV is simply amazing. I originally bought this tv from circuit city as an open box for $1400 with few scratches on the panel. Their orignal price was $1709 + tax(8.25%) At the time, it seemed like a real bargain. 2 days later, i went online and found it on Amazon for $1299 Brand new, free shipping and best of all NO SALES TAX! So i took the chance and made my biggest purchase online. I called ECL and arranged to have them ship it to me a day earlier so i wouldnt have to take off from work. They were great! Nobody was home at the time delivery so they called me and waited outside for 30 minutes until i got back home. Tv arrived in original MFG box without a single scratch. So far tv works great!! My only complain is with the speakers. But the picture quality is simply great. I returned the open box tv back to circuit city. Overall, I ended up saving $100 (500+ over regular price) AND got me a brand new tv!!!"
5,"Beautiful, bright picture, smart styling.","The swivel base is very useful. The glossy black case gives the set a classy look. The speakers are invisible, but the sound is very decent even without external speakers. Very satisfied."
2,Dissapointed to ths TV,"Many people give a good review to this TV, so I bought this TV. Feel disappointed. The picture quality is not good. I used to have a Dell 37"" LCD, it only has about 800 to 1 contrast ratio , but the picture quality is much much better than this 4,000 to 1 contrast ratio TV. I don't know why?"
1,T.V STAND BASE IS BROKEN,"LAMENTABLY ON HAVING UNCOVERED THE BOX TV , ME NOTICE THAT I COME WITH THE TORN(BROKEN) BASE, I HOPE THAT WERE RE-PUTTING ME THE BASE, I ATACH PHOTOS THAT DEMONSTRATE THE FACT, WAIT FOR HER,YOU RESPONSE SOON, PLASE TO SEND THE REPLACEMENT T.V. BASE, IT TO THE SAME SHIPING ADDRESS.DUE TO THIS DISADVANTAGE, CANNOT DO ANY QUALIFICATION OF THE PRODUCT TO HER FOR THE PRESENT, UNTIL THE DESCRIBED PROBLEM IS RESOLVED."
4,Spec?,There are few errors on the specs for this TV on Amazon.com description:- Contrast ratio is 4000:1 NOT 5000:1- Only one(1) HDMI not Two(2)Go to Samsung.com and check it out!
2,Don't Buy - Very poor screen quality,"I am very disappointed with this product. I went and saw it in a circuit city and best buy, then found a great price on Amazon and bought it. In the stores, I guess I couldn't pick up on the poor screen quality. However, it is very hard on the eyes to watch this screen as the images are way too blurry and motion often leaves ""trails"". We bought the tv partly based on the exterior aesthetics, as it has a very sleek look and displays well as a room fixture. But the picture quality is so poor I don't even want to watch it and can't return it due to Amazon's policy. So much for watching Hi-def football at home this year...I'm better off with my old 30"" tube screen in the home office instead of the family room."
4,Samsung LNS4051D,"The purchase of the Samsung LNS4051D is my first foray in the world of HDTV. I've sat on the sidelines for a few years watching HD technology mature. When I saw the Samsung 4051 at Circuit City I knew the time had come to purchase a television.This particular TV's reviews in the press has been lukewarm at best. I compared the specs. and the picture of the other competitors and found that the Samsung overall was the best for me. I won't go into the particulars, but this TV deserves a look-see.My experience with Eagle USA transport, the company Amazon uses, was great. The delivery was quick and uneventful."
2,good looking but doesn't work,"One star for good looks and one star for good price, one more star for nice job on delivery. However, no picture, sound only with some digital noise, buggy remote, waiting on pickup for trip to repair shop, missed watching my favorite bowl game on HD. I guess they don't fully test these units before shipping, service man said he was backed up and will get to it as soon as he can, over a month since I ordered it, the delivery process is slow and repairs look slower. If you are in a hurry, forget it. I will update this if it gets fixed before the remainder of the playoffs. (- a star for missing nut bowel game)"
5,Why didn't I get one sooner?,"Wow, this TV is something else. Watching DVD's on the widescreen with the eyepopping picture is a delight. The picture is so vivid and crisp. Regular programming is better, but use this TV with HD programming and momma mia, what a treat. Football games are fantastic. The food network in HD is mouth watering. You won't believe it until you have one for yourself. Go for it."
2,samsung stop wkg,"bought this in 2006, perfect until now. picture goes off still has sound. turn it off and back on after a few minutes picture comes back but goes out again after a few minutes. very dissapointed after paying over $1,000 for this TV."
2,shuts itself off !!,"Samsung LNS4051D 40-Inch LCD HDTVThe product was amazing for about an year but recently it started shutting itself off after 10-20 minutes of usage!! It would not power back on regardless of what I would do !Eventually, after waiting for a few minutes, it would power back on. But this time on, the time to die would be much less!!I am tired of the random power shut downs :(...hope someone can help out!"
2,Thumbs down on longevity,"Bought this in Nov 2006. No hitches w/Amazon delivery. Picture, sound and setup great. Skip to Feb 2008... Power supply died. Very disappointed that a problem arose in such a short period of time. I did not get an extended warranty so I'm getting the part myself and installing it for $150. Repairman wanted $440 with me taking the TV to their shop.I'm completely disillusioned and expect for other boards in the unit to continue to fail. Remember when TVs lasted for YEARS?"
1,Samsung Junk,Bouth the unit in January. It died in October. Samsung wants $1000 to repair. Customer service at Samsung is terrible. Very cold hearted and uncaring that a 10 month old high dollar TV is dead. I will personally never buy another Samsung product. Avoid!
4,Great video but sound is not so great,"This is a great TV for viewing HDTV channels. It's simply amazing the quality of the picture. Viewing quality of non-HDTV channels can vary quite a bit depending on the signal. Some are pretty bad, but others looks good. It's not the set, but just the way it is with LCDs and non-HDTV channels. The sound is not so great, but when I want to watch a game, I plug in other speakers. I think for the money, this set is excellent.One warning though. If you have a problem with it, good luck getting service with Samsung. I have a DVD recorder which died after installing the latest firmware to fix a problem with choppy video. I've called several times, but I keep getting the ""we're experiencing an unusual volume of calls"" message (yeah sure). I've emailed service twice, and have yet to get a response. So I hope my relatively expensive HDTV does not have a problem, because I doubt I'll be able to get Samsung to fix it."
4,pleased with my purchase...,"researched for a while about which HDTV to buy, decided on this one - pleased with it's performance... HD through directv is great, standard def is okay with some pixilation - mostly with fast moving sports shows.highly recommend it to anyone who wants a great HD and DVD picture in a really slim, beautifully designed black frame."
1,No Power!!!,"I bought this TV at Best Buy during their sale. I brought it home and took it out of the box 2 days later. The set would not even power on! It's a beautiful looking TV, but don't you think a very basic element of enjoying your TV is that it turns on when you buy it?? I got a refund when I took it in. I'll be looking for another set. I had to select one star because you can't select zero."
4,Great Buy!,My first LCD HDTV and its amazing. I love it. Nothing to complain about here. All movies and pictures look great!
4,Just right.,Very clear in HD and it works good. Not a big fan with the channel setup options for HD--it could have been better. I wasn't able to add or delete air channels very easily and everything had to be autoprogrammed. Overall I'm very pleased with the service of Amazon and the tv itself.
4,Excellent HDTV for a low price,I purchased a Samsung LNS4015 40 inch LCD HDTV from Amazon.com.The shipment arrived on the due date in the excellent condition.The HDTV picture quality is very good.Thank You Amazon .com for the best service.
5,Great value for the money,"I've had the TV for about a month now. It was easy to set up. The TV comes with 3 pre-set picture modes: standard, movie, and dynamic. The standard mode looks fine with regular non-HD TV and when using the TV as a computer monitor - the web never looked better. The movie and dynamic picture modes make the picture look dull and blotchy, but you can customize them for a great picture. DVD's look great on this set. I recommend this set to anyone looking for a 40 inch set."
4,I love this tv,"This is a great tv. I also own a 62"" Mitsubishi dlp set and prefer this one in most cases. The only downside is that it has weak speakers."
4,"Samsung 40"" LCD TV","TV is great and shipping was fast and easy. However, after three days the TV showed some problems with the color (all black areas became bright red). Samsung sent a technician, who fixed the problem after two visits (didn't have the right spare part first time).One experience: if you get one of these high definition TV's you definitely need HDTV service, because you can actually see how crappy regular cable TV picture quality is. Best is to ask your service provider for fiber-to-the-home service like Verizon's FiOS."
5,very happy with my purchase,"my wife & i did a good bit of research in brick & mortar stores before visiting amazon. i was actually looking at a slightly less expensive model samsung with 3000:1 contrast ratio, but then i saw that something like 70% of the people who viewed that model ended up ultimately purchasing this one with 4000:1. i've had this beauty in my living room now for 6 weeks and it's inspired lust in the hearts of all the folks who've come by to visit. regular tv looks great, but the hd channels are mind-bogglingly beautiful. strong buy recommendation! ps, buying on amazon got me a better product with no sales tax & ended up saving me over $700."
5,Satisfied Customer,"This 40"" TV was the perfect size for the bedroom. Hooked up to the Samsung DVD-HD860 Upconverter with some Monster HDMI cables, it brings out the high quality movies to the TV. The sounds are ok on the TV, but I bought a Sony Sony HT-DDW700 Home Theater ($199) and it completed the system."
5,Quite nice,"This TV makes for a GREAT computer monitor. If you have this tv, you'll want to hook up a computer to it.As far as picture quality goes, it is clear that the source is the bottleneck. Even some channel's HD broadcasts aren't as crisp as they should be."
4,Very good LCD TV,"[...]The television is also first rate. I bought it for my son for his Xbox 360. He said the clarity is awesome. The picture is good as well. If you are not interested in gameing, there are plenty of TV's out there that are as good or better for HDTV and or regular television.All in all, my experience with Amazon.com was very very good. The price was also very good."
3,Works well with sedans but not so good with vans,"The product is very good for the price. However, when I wanted to use it with my Dodge Grand Caravan, The pieces were not able to match. I did use it anyway, but I have to drive slower than normal to avoid loosing the bikes."
3,Not as good as advertised.,"I bought this for my car after buying two bikes. It accomodates two bikes well, the problem is that youre scared that they are going to fall off while youre driving! All that holds the bikes in place are cloth straps and there are no dividers to seperate the bikes. As a result the bikes bang against one another."
2,Relax with -- Amazon Rain Fprest,"This is an album of wild jungle sounds ""enhanced with music."" I didn't like the music. It was too loud and meandered formlessly around no melody and no rhythm. Other environmental albums I have purchased from this series, without music, were outstanding. I would recommend purchasing only those albums which do not have music added."
5,Jackie Opel is a neglected genius,"Jackie Opel was born Dalton Bishop in 1938 in Bridgetown, Barbados. He is best known now for his contibution to the early years of Ska Music in Jamaica. As sometime singer and arranger with the Skatalites his contribution has been consistently unvalued.As a solo singer and songwriter he produced classic records in differing styles. In my opinion as a deep soul singer he is up there with the best and this album relesed after his death in a car accident in 1970 has some fantastic ballads sung most beautifully by someone with the range of Jackie Wilson.The album also features two Jackie Wilson originals electrically sung in 'spouge beat' attributed as being first used by Opel and very popular in the Caribbean in the early 70'sjackie Opel sounds so good that it makes me quite emotional. If you want to know more an article will appear on him in October in 'Voices From The Shadows' a specialist magazine from near Hull in the North of England.Its on the net."
2,disappointed,"I used Braun, Norelco, and Panasonic Linear electric shavers before trying this shaver. The Grundig takes much longer than the other shavers to get a decent shave. My facial hair also seemed to grow back much faster than with other electric shavers. Finally, when I used the Parks Products pre-shave products, strange streak marks appeared on the shaver. This did not happen with my other electric shavers. I view these marks as a sign of the low quality of the case. (see one of the other reviews for a similar comment)I just bought the Panasonic pro-curve 8092. That shaver is far superior to the Grundig, Braun and Norelco shavers I have owned in the past."
3,"looks nice, but not so functional","this toaster looks great. It has a few problems however. It can toast thick breads, such as bagels, quite well. Longer breads must be put in vertically as they won't fit horizontally. When you put them in vertically, the edge of the bread does not get toasted. It is also difficult to get things out of the toaster. When the toast pops up, it does not go above the top of the toaster. You have to use two hands to push up the lever to get the toast to go above the top of the toaster. Our ten year old has burned fingers several times in just a few weeks. Overall, this toaster looks great, but I would not purchase this model again"
1,I NEVER GOT MY BOOK!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!,"I am really mad bc I never got this book! As of 3 weeks after I oredered it, it had not been shipped! I had to cancell my order!"
5,Great value for the money,"Perfect for yard work and dusty conditions. Great quality for the money. Not the thin cheap masksthat do not hold their shape. Needless to say, I am very pleased with this product."
4,works ok,"I'll give it a 4 since it does say it's a nuisance dust mask on the box. I don't think you would use this in a shop or work environment with lots of dust. It only has one band, so it definitely does not fit as snug as a 2 band mask. probably why it's not NIOSH approved. but it states that in the description so you can't totally fault it. good for light duty."
4,Dust Mask,The dust mask is better than average. Nose fitter is of sturdy metal that holds its shape nicely. Straps are securely fastened and of a strong stretchy material. Have some in 3 work places and each vehicle.
4,not bad,"for how many you get in this package is a great deal. No they arent the highest quality, but they do the job."
2,Strong smell,"The price, design and manufacture are fine and the product would receive a 4 or 5 star except for the masks smell strongly of some fragrance like hand lotion. Perhaps some workers spilled hand lotion into my box, but I fear it is part of the manufacturing process. I use the masks to block pollen and dust for allergy prevention, and the smell is to irritating to use."
5,Works Perfectly,I feed the wild birds. The seeds kick up dust from the ground. My understanding is that bird feces can scar your lungs. This safety mask covers my face perfectly. I am very happy with my purchase.
1,Dust Mask-Can't Breathe,"I only used one of these and will probably not use anymore in the box, I wanted a dust mask to wear when cleaning out my cats' litter box due to the dust 'stirred up' when completing this task. I found it difficult to breathe when wearing this dust mask. I did not like this product at all. Will not purchase this product again."
2,Poorly Fitting & Permeable,"The SAS Safety 2985 Non-Toxic Dust Mask box of 50 masks is certainly inexpensive. Unfortunately, their quality is proportional to their cost. I got the masks to filter out the dust of scoopable cat litter. The masks filter out some dust but, even after adjustment and trying multiple positions for the mask & head strap, they do not fit snugly to my face and so allow dust through spaces between my face and the mask. I've also noticed that, even when the mask is fitted more snugly than usual to my face, the litter dust comes through the mask to the point where it's visible around my nose after I take off the mask. The mask does filter out some dust. My asthma hasn't been as bad with the masks as without. However, the masks allow enough dust through that I'm still smelling and tasting it while scooping the litter. Since they have some function and are inexpensive, I'm giving the masks two stars."
2,Cheap and Cheap,"These were the bottom of the barrel for keeping smells out. They only have one loop to keep them in place and that is just not enough. I had to send them back, spend alot more, and then I got a good mask."
2,Strange smell,"These dust masks have a strange smell to them. It is so strong it makes them unusable for me, but if you aren't sensitive to chemical odors, these may work for you. There's a chance I just got an off box, but I didn't want to go through the hassle of exchanging to find out."
1,Pump It Up George,The name is perfect for this product. The instructions say you can cook a 5lb. chicken in it so we bought a 4 lb. one. Everytime it spun around it hit the heat source. I recommend the bigger one!
1,not the real thing.,"It was in very poor condition and not as sturdy as the original one. I have an original one.. not the same.. trying to get my money back,.."
1,Do Not Buy waste of money,It does not cook a 5 lb. chicken maybe a 2 or 3 lb. I used a 4 lb. chicken and it would not even turn. I cooked a roast which I followed the instructed on how long to cook it for and it almost burned it if I decided not to check it half way through the cooking process. Waste of money!!!
2,WARNING! It may say *new* but isn't always!!,"I am perfectly happy with the rotisserie. I am VERY unhappy that it was advertised as NEW and it very clearly was not. There were bbq sauce spots and grease on it! It also came with no manual or instructions. I just cleaned it and downloaded the instructions figuring that was simpler than having to ship it back, wait for another etc. What made it worse was that it was a gift and VERY embarassing that it was not new. The rotisserie is great, the seller, Amazon, customer service, whatever...was not!"
1,Too Small & Hard to Use,"This Rotisserie is too small for even small chickens and when I follwed the recipe to cook a small roast, it turned out tough and over done.Do not buy this Rotisserie even if you only cook for two people."
4,Good for chicken and salmon,"We received this last Christmas and have used it many, many times. This does a good job on chicken and will do up to 5 lb if the chicken is 'tucked' and tied well making it as slim as possible. The salmon recipe is excellent and usually turns out pretty good, although the timer has no markings between 15 and 30 minutes and you have to guess where to set it which makes it difficult to get doneness consistently right. This does NOT work for cooking good steak or burgers. There is no browning on the outside, making for a weird color, and it made the meat almost inedible. I was going to try kabobs but not after getting horrid results with steak and burgers. I would stick to grilling beef (or even broiling or frying) rather than use this. Clean up is not too bad if you spray with cleaner or soak asap."
4,This one stays on the counter,"I buy a lot of small appliances & most of them end up in the pantry (like the huge roaster that doesn't brown, the thing that just cooks hog dogs etc) But this one is a keeper. The chicken is moist, the roast pork was delicious. Way to go George!"
2,Didn't like!,"My primary complaint about this appliance is the fact that there is no temperature gauge. The preset temp cooked the food too fast. The wings on the chicken were almost burned before the rest of the chicken was done. After only 3-4 uses, I gave the the appliance to the Goodwill. George, I love the grill, but you blew it on this one."
3,Decent if you're single,"The unit works as advertised and the food comes out delicious. Unfortunately even though it's the ""baby"" size I still find it at times to be impractible even when making small individual meals. There was many times I had to trim the portions just so it would fit into the rotisserie."
2,It works well enough for a entry level Rotisserie,"It gets the job done, but with it's largely plastic contstruction it's easy to damage, and it's hard to take it apart in a way that makes it easy to clean.If it was easier to clean all the parts I'd give it a higher rating. If you think you're going to use it often, I'd opt for something made better than this."
5,"Great machine, but.....","For all rotisserie lovers: this machine is awesome, but read carefully when the instructions say to bake up to a five pound chicken. It does not work when the user (that would be me) doesn't follow instructions. We are now ordering the Jr. size and predict complete satisfaction. The parts are fairly easy to clean (a little elbow grease is required around the vent areas). The chicken is moist and better than the store bought. And the standing rib roast is done perfectly. For the price, it's a great little machine."
4,Happy for 3 years but...,"I've had my Baby Ronco for over 3 years and I've been very, very happy with it. It cooks a 5lb chicken beautifully and I love being able to turn it on and forget about it. My only issue is the knob to turn it on is awkwardly placed and just recently broke off. Now I have a rotisserie but no way to turn it on. It's also often a guess at how long you're setting it for since the control is very wobbly(?). Like an egg timer, you need to go past the time you want to set it and then ease it back to make sure you're getting the timing correct. Alas, with the knob broke, I'm not sure what to do with it. I bought mine at an outrageous sale at Sears and I'm not sure I want to pay what they want for a new one to replace it."
3,SHIPPING!!,"I was pleased with my choice of products. ALTHOUGH! I recieved the product in its original box. Now the product arrives at my door(which was answered by my mother) and it was not in a brown box like NORMAL companies do business, but in the white box with George Foreman staring her right in the face. And now my mothers christmas surprise was ruined! And I also PAID five freaking dollars to get the christmas bundle to my step! Thank you for the inconvenience, by being too cheap to put your products in a brown box labeled amazon.com. And I do not recomend buying from amazon dot com any time in the future even if my life depended on it."
1,exploding door,The first time we used it we were cooking chicken legs in the basket after 1 hour cooking we heard something breaking in the kitchen. the door had exploded for no reason needless to say we put it back in the box and back it went go to the store for a refund.
2,C'mon People...,"Sounds like Toby Wright is trying too hard to recreate the Alice In Chains sound... listen to the vocals for God sake! Personally, I think that this CD is really boring and the songs are sloppy."
3,What happend...?,What happend to the old Taproot? I mean this isnt a bad album by far... but it's not near as good as the first one... I bought this album the first day it came out and I was very dissapointed... It's not near as heavy as the first album and it didnt have the same melodic vocals as the first one either... I dont recomend this album but if you are a hardcore taproot fan you should still buy this album for the hell of it.
2,could have been better,"I bought GIFT a few months before WElCOME came out I was really impressed by their unique style, then I saw I heard thier first single ""poem"" and I was impressed with that too. I figured they would go soft and break away from the nu-metal trend as everybody else was doing and take a Deftones approach to their music. Well I'm not really sure what they did but I really didn't like their sophmore effort, still they created a unique sound and if you like punk/alternative style music then this is for you but if your into more of a heavier sound it's not worth buying, ""dreams"" in my opinion is the only other song worth listening to if you really liked the first album."
2,Heavy .......right!!!!!!,All i could say about hearing the whole cd was that ...just watch the videos on tv.....or download their 2 songs that are actually ok......but do not buy the cd. JUST DOWNLOAD IT.....dont waste your money.
2,A very sad dissapointment,"Taproot was my favorite band for quite some time after their release of Gift. Gift is one of my favorite albumns of all time. For years I was waiting for Taproot to come out with a new albumn. My expectations were set pretty high when I bought Welcome. I was horrified to find out that Taproot had gone soft. They were much better before they were so well-known, back when Gift was around. Welcome is completely pop.. it's horrible. If you don't own any Taproot albumns, I highly recommend that you get Gift."
3,Pretty Average,"The second song is great, the rest are OK but not something I would like to listen to all the time. Buy it used or on sale, don't pay full price."
2,Kinda ...,"The only fabulous song on this CD is the single which is Poem. The rest of the songs are mediocre and boring. Some of the other songs are good. Overall, if you don't like it when heavy metal bands make slow beat type stuff, with no catchy melody then you won't like this or Mushroomhead. Skip this and download Poem."
4,"Solid CD, better then Gift","First, this CD is not any softer then their first CD Gift. The main difference is when they do play soft, they do it for an entire song rather then just for part of it. Another improvement over Gift is the fact that all the songs don't sound the same on Welcome. Taproot as definitely matured in their sound, but retained their edge and still have one of the best singers in rock music today. I agree with a previous review that stated that Taproot sounds more ""together"" in this record. Some of the transitions were strange, and just didn't flow well. Fortunately, no such problems exist here. Just solid hard rock tunes that any rock fan should enjoy. If you are a fan of older Taproot stuff, or really like the stuff you may have heard from them on the radio, I would certainly recommend adding Welcome to your CD collection."
3,Step down from Gift.,"The CD overall is pretty decent for a nu-metal band. The lyrics are nice as is the music. There are some weird tracks on here, which I can't think of off the top of my head.The CD itself is very well produced. I would have rated this album a 4 star, but it has ""Gift"" to compare to. They set their standard pretty high with ""Gift"", and then kind of went downhill from there. This CD is worth picking up if you want some creative music, but if you want some catchy music, this is not the CD for you. ""Poem"" is a very catchy song, as are one or two other songs, but the CD as a whole falls short."
2,wateva,Carbon copy Incubus. Everescence are a carbon copy Linkin Park. Listen to good music for god sake ppl!!
2,I Was Pretty Let Down,"I have never heard the album ""Gift,"" but I purchased this one because I heard so much about these guys. I pop the CD in, and I thought these guys sounded WAAAAAY too much like Alice in Chains. You don't even need to listen to it that closely to realize that.The only song I really liked was ""Poem,"" because that one at least sounded original. The other songs sound way too much like Alice in Chains copycats. The guitar play is pretty good at times, but the vocals just sound too much like Layne Staley's.Now it's all clear why I was able to buy this CD at [discount store] for only [a low price]. I should've known better.Overall feeling: Very, VERY disappointed. If you want a great hard rock album, check out Stone Sour."
2,Not What I Expected,"When I bought this album on CD at Target nearly a decade ago, I was expecting more guitar riffs and grittier sound and was intrigued by the name Taproot. I ignored the ""Explicit"" warning, which for me, probably meant more intense lyrics. What a letdown this album was. I ended up selling it at Half Price Books less than a year later and not because I was broke, either...there are only two songs that stand out. ""Poem"" and ""When"" are the two I chose to download on iTunes, meaning the rest of the album lacked musical punch; did not have any catchy melodies; and was certainly difficult to listen to for any length of time. At least Cinderella wowed the American stage with one great album (""Night Songs"") and a follow-up single; Taproot will end up being just another one-hit wonder."
3,Some good songs but QUIT WHINING,"this album was pretty good...a year ago i thought it was amazing, perhaps cos i was pretty depressed and could relate to the songs. a year onwards, most songs sound boring and the lead singer's voice is so whiny. and as for the lyrics? emotional pain overload!! the lead singer seems to enjoy wallowing in his own misery. if you count the amount of times he says the words 'me' 'myself' 'mine' or 'I' then you probably count them about 300 times. this album doesn't age gracefully. my favourite song is dreams. that one is the only really good one."
5,Best Album Of The Year,"taproots new album ""welcome"" is the best album that was released this year. it beats out all of the other nu metal bands that put out their sophmore albums this year for many reasons.the most important reason is that they have evolved as songwriters. they made an album not just full of the same energy seen on their debut ""gift"" but it also displays mature writing that makes up the amazing songs found on ""welcome"". I highly reccomend this album to anybody that is tired of all the nu metal garbage that continues to circulate. best songs are ""art"" and ""mine"""
4,Great vocals,"Taproot's newest cd is largely very good. While so many groups today follow the same pattern and sound exactly the same, Taproot has their own unique sound, presently that is. Mind you they sound remarkably like Alice in Chains, but that's a sound that works for me. This album puts together great guitar riffs and the lead vocals are very impressive. The mixed blend of slight screaming and calm verses proves to work well together on these songs. In my opinion the very best songs on this album are Poem, Breathe and Time. If you like bands such as Chevelle, NIckelback and Mudvayne than there is a good chance that you will enjoy this album."
2,well.....,"Well, personally, im the kind of guy that hears a couple songs and buys the cd's(cheap though). Well, i got hooked on poem. so, i figured the rest SHOULD be the like Poem. Was it? NO. Poem was fast and furious with instrumentals and vocals. But the rest is SLOW. the instrumentals seem wrongly placed, and the lyrics dont go well either. Im not saying the whole cd is bad though. Some songs, like fault, did catch my attention. but nothing too special. overall, a below average cd, so if your thinking of getting it, get a used one or just download Poem."
2,What did they do????,"Taprrot were one of the biggest hopes in new/alternative metal. they were heavy and creative. now they want to sound like alice in chains or creed. nothing special, just boring and bad is this. 2 stars for the good songs POEM, LIKE and DREAMS."
3,completely different from gift,"after listening to the tracks on this cd it was evident that taproot had no intension of going back to the heaviness on gift. if your into the really soft stuff, this band does it well. but still, i can listen to it no more than 20 minutes before i decide to listen to gift again. dont get me wrong though, these guys are awesome and they really proved it live with mudvayne. get this if your a hardcore fan."
2,The Reasons Why,"i'd like to start out saying that i knew this cd was supposed to sound different from gift. mission accomplished.however, they took on a second mission that was really just a part of the first one and it failed miserably. they tried to completely recreate themselves. i am listening to this cd now, trying to get into it, and much like the new mudvayne, it's just not working.i was thinking this would be a truly outstanding cd because, just one month before, i caught them in minneapolis and all the new stuff was absolutely amazing and i was moshing with the rest of them. i guess the songs all gain something in the live translation...thus, i was disappointed by the album. how can one that sounds so perfect live sound like it does on this album? i'm disappointed, but hoping for a return to form from this talented quartet."
2,Nothing special,"When some guy in here said ""TOOL, beware!"" it honestly made me laugh out loud. Come on now."
1,Disappointing,"This band was amazing, gift was truly that. Now taproot seems to be following in the footsteps of nonpoint and incubus...maybe just to get some radio play, well so long taproot, it was nice knowing you while you were still true to the metal/underground scene."
2,Dissapointing,"I have been a fan of Taproot since I heard their first single ""Again and Again."" I picked up their first cd, ""Gift,"" on the first day it came out and I loved it. They have such a unique style. After seeing them play live a few times, I was anxiously awaiting the day that they would release a new album. Again, I bought this cd on the first day it came out, but I was extremely disappointed this time. I was hoping for some great hard rock melodies, but instead got mediocre, soft, boring melodies. I tried as hard as I could to like the cd, I even kept it in my cd rotation for a week or two, but finally gave up...extremely disappointed. The songs still sound okay live, but I just can't listen to this album."
1,Don't Waste Your Money!,"This toy is just awful. It is nothing more than cheap plastic rods and balls with an elasticized rope inside. The shapes you put together just flop all over and it is not a lot of fun trying to untwist the sticks once they are in a mass. They are just junky in my opinion and we have been much happier with Zoobs, Mags and Legos. Even the building sets from Denny's are much, much better than this toy. Yuck."
2,My thoughts on this favorite,"This would have been a great CD of Tchaikovsky's Nutcracker, however the actual volume of all the pieces are so LOW! You have to have the volume on your stereo way up just to hear it at an audible level. Disappointed in this CD only because of the volume factor."
5,A WINNING APPROACH TO BLACKJACK,"This 2 1/2-hour video is a great deal for beginning counters who prefer learning by seeing to learning by reading from a book. Jim Schian teaches basic strategy and elementary car counting using the hi-lo count. Production values are high and Schian's explanations are clear and easy to follow.If you are just starting to count, or if you have been attempting to learn to count for some time and you are struggling with charts, flash cards, and dealing to yourself, this video might do the trick. It provides a classroom-style approach, with strategies demostrated with actual cards on a blackjack table."
5,very good,I ordered this for my mom because she was going to take her GED test and she loved it! She's just been studying and hopefully she will do great.
3,Wrong Mount,The picture clearly shows mounting to a round pipe of the roll cage. I received mounting hardware for something rectangular.
2,Wow these LEAK!,"I used about 800 Lansinoh bags to freeze breast milk. I wanted to make sure I had enough to last until my 2nd baby was 1 with going back to work. While I made this happen, I am very dissappointed in these bags. At least half of them leak. Doesn't matter which way they were frozen (standing up or laying down) and doesn't matter how we defrost them (in the fridge, on the counter, or in warm water.) At least half of them leak. I did not overfill them and they were treated like gold in their own freezer. If anyone finds a milk bag that doesn't leak, LET ME KNOW as I have another on the way!"
1,Not worth it,"this is a dumb product. you can't pump into it and you wind up having to pour the milk from something else into this - its a mess everytime. i spilled everytime, until i decided not to bother."
1,Scared to defrost the milk!!!!!,"I am so frustrated, disappointed and annoyed with these bags! I strictly pump for my daughter and worked hard to build a good supply so that I could stop before the year is up. (My freezer has, I'd say about 3 gallons of Lansinoh bags). I have begun rotating the older milk out, defrosting milk from November and December; I have lost over 40oz to date and just had 2 more bags leaking from the seams. Take my advice and look into the Honeysuckle brand, the free coupon I used to buy them early on was worth learning about the quality of this brand."
3,"Bags leaked, but customer service was great.","Initially, I liked the feel and function of these bags best of the brands I have tried, which include Medela and Gerber. After freezing, however, I had the same problem that other reviewers reported with the Lansinoh bags leaking at the bottom seams. I was quite careful to follow instructions about bag capacity and storing flat, and I defrosted gently in warm water, so I believe it to be a defect with the bag, not user error!I emailed Lansinoh about my experience, and they were very apologetic and provided 100 bags free of charge via priority mail. While I am still a little nervous about using the bags, I now have the option of double bagging, which should help. I rate these bags a 3 because while leaking bags defeat the purpose and are a huge disappointment, it was an intermittent problem and I found the company to be very responsive to my issues with their product. I am hopeful that they will solve the leak problem in future."
1,worst milk storage bags ever,So I'm currently taking care of my 4th kid so I know a few things about freezing milk. We've packed a freezer full of milk for 4 kids now over the past several years.Problem with these bags - when dunking a bag of frozen breast milk into hot water to thaw it out - the bags rip - a small hole will inevitably leak out milk. Its happened about 70% of the time out of the last 30 bags I've had to thaw.Absolutely ridiculous. How hard can it be to make a milk storage bag? The plastic needs to be thicker.
1,DON'T WASTE YOUR MONEY!,"LADIES, DO NOT WASTE YOUR MONEY! I have lost anywhere between 5-20oz every morning when I come to find my frozen milk has leaks in the bag. It isnt just in the seems ro corners either but rather all over the bag. It is rediculous the price you pay just to lose the most precious thing you can give your child. VERY dissatisfied"
1,Horrible bags. Leak like crazy.,I exclusively pumped for 9 and a half months and was able to freeze 1500 oz. I used tons and tons of these bags and will NEVER use them again. I can't believe how many of these bags have leaked. It is unbelievable. Medela bags are definitely the way to go. Don't waste your money buying Lansinoh bags. You will be very disappointed.
1,They Break!,"I ordered these bags as a change from my usual because the reviews I read seemed good, and they are definitely more affordable. However, they keep breaking!! Not when I fill them, but after they come out of the freezer, no matter if I let them thaw on the counter or place the bag in warm water, they leak. I am utterly frustrated as this has happened several times! The contents of these bags are like liquid gold, and I can't afford to waste any milk! Last night I placed a bag from the freezer into the refrigerator and this morning I opened the door to find my milk dripping all over the fridge. Ugh!"
1,Leaky bags,"My son receives donor milk and whenever we see Lansinoh bags we know they will leak. It doesn't matter if they were frozen flat or upright or if the are stuck to other bags. If you have already frozen milk in these bags, when you defrost them, sterilize a container with a lid, rinse the bag well before placing it inside and let the bag defrost in there. At least then you know you have untainted milk in the container even if the bag leaks."
1,"So sad, disappointed, and frustrated","Like so many other moms, I have had terrible leaking problems with these bags when they thaw. I'm on my third child now using the bags and this is the first time I've had this problem over the last 3.5 years so I'm not sure if the quality is worse or I just got lucky with the other two kids...either way, I have been feeding my baby pumped milk soley since birth and as I start to wean from pumping and need to supplement with the frozen milk I've stored, I'm finding 8 out of 10 bags are leaking and I'm losing the precious milk! I'm having to thaw in the fridge inside a ziplock bag...not sterilized, but I'm trying to reserve as much of the milk as I can. This is really unacceptable and Lanisoh needs to address this problem!! The hard work to save precious breast milk (not to mention pain, in my case) is met with such a devastating end.....definitely crying over leaked/lost milk..."
2,storage bags.....a little leaky,"They truly leak a little bit and make a mess. not something I recommend for first time breast feeders. I prefered to pump into bottles and pour into ice cube trays. Each cube is an ounce, once frozen store in zip lock freezer bags"
5,Great bags!,"These bags work well for me with pumping and freezing breastmilk. I've never had one leak. I've even dropped them on the kitchen floor on accident and they never broke open. The only thing I wish I could change about them is I wish the bags could be used for pumping rather than having to use bottles and then transfer them to the bags, like the Medela ones."
1,leaks- buy medela!,"I used the Medela storage bags for my 1st son and never had an issue. I bought the Lansinoh bags for my 2nd because they were a better deal and held more milk. So far, 5 bags have had a leak out of a package of 50. I defrosted them in the fridge and would find milk all over the fridge because of a tiny leak in the bottom of the bag. I now defrost them in a small bowl just in case- hate to waste any liquid gold! I also splurged for some Medela bags and am using those instead of finishing off the Lansinoh bags. Save your money and buy Medela!"
4,"Sturdy, good value for lots of freezing","I bought 200 of these because of the price, as I am pumping a lot for a friend's adopted daughter as well as for my own 7 month old daughter, my second child. I like the double zipper and find these are sturdier than the Gerber bags. I haven't had a leakage problem with these, and I freeze my milk flat and then thaw under warm water (as does my friend) immediately before use. I just finished my first pack of 50, and I think these are a great value for a great bag."
1,Bags leak!!,"Very frustrating that my milk is wasted when the bags leak upon defrosting, even when defrosted in the refrigerator . I used the olde bags with my first child, the ones with the pouring handle. This new brand is horrible."
1,LEAK when you defrost 'em,"Title says it all, these leak when you defrost them. Incredibly frustrating. Go with Medela, which have never leaked on us."
2,Bags leak when defrosted :-(,"While I was pumping and storing breast milk I really liked the bags. They were easy to fill, had the double zipper, and seemed durable. They also stood up well in my First Years storage container for the freezer. HOWEVER, now that I am starting to defrost the breast milk I worked so hard to pump and store, I am finding one in three (33%) bags leaks. The leaks seem to always happen on the bottom seam - the seam that was designed to allow the bags to stand up as you fill them. I now defrost the bags UPSIDE DOWN in a glass bowl. I have to wait until they are fully thawed in the fridge, because I can't run water over the ones that have leaks (blow outs really!). I sure wish they were more durable. :-( I have over 100 bags left frozen. Had I read the reviews on Babies R Us before buying them, I would have bought the more expensive Medela bags. I would not rec. these bags."
1,THE BAGS LEAK!!,The bags that I have been storing milk in get holes on the bottom. Do not waste your money on these bags!!
1,Lansinoh,These bags are horrible! I've returned back to work and haven't been pumping very much milk so I've been relying on my frozen supply. . It's very disappointing that my frozen milk are getting wasted due to leaking bags while defrosting. Out of 3 bags I was defrosting tonight 2 leaked.
1,Bags leak!!!,It seems that every time we thaw the milk in these bags they have a hole in them and we end up wasting a lot of the milk. It sort of defeats the purpose of freezing the milk if you are going to lose half of it...
1,leaks,In my experience with these bags when I go to thaw them in the fridge half the time when I go to get it out it is all over the fridge because the bag leaked. I now thaw them in a cup so I don't lose any more milk.
1,Disappointing Leaky Bags,I am very disappointed with these storage bags...I used Medela storage bags with my first child and had no problems..With my Second child i had an ample milk supply and because the Medela bags are a little more expensive i switched to the Lansinoh bags. Now that i am thawing them to feed my daughter i have to throw away 2 to 3 bags a day because they start leaking..I have tried different methods of thawing to see if that made a difference but no matter how i thaw the milk the bags still leak..You get what you pay for..Be careful moms spend a little extra money but buy a better product....
1,These bags leak!,"I had the same problem mentioned by a previous reviewer. These bags leaked when I defrosted them, and I had to pour out the milk because of contamination concerns. About 1/2 of the bags I defrosted ended up getting thrown out!"
2,They leak :(,"My son is now eating through the 2000-ounce freezer stash of breastmilk I pumped for him and stored in these Lansinoh bags. The first 25 bags I used were Medela bags, and those thawed beautifully. The Lansinoh bags have been quite a mess. About half of them leak from pinholes that form along the bottom gusset. To save all that milk I worked so hard on, I now have each bag sitting in a glass in the refrigerator so it can catch the milk as it leaks out. Sad.For my next baby, I will either use Medela bags, or make milk cubes. Milk cubes would allow greater control over how much milk to defrost at once, anyway."
1,Avanti cooler only lasts 12 months,"I purchased this water cooler a year ago and found the water temperature to be not very cold. Only cool but not ice cold, but it was better than tap water.It also made a loud noise when operating and would often do weird things that make it seem as if it is faulty. It would after a long time resume and again give cool water but never ice cold.Almost to the day, one year after purchase it died.I should have known. The reviews showed this up very clearly but I did not heed the warnings.Hope you know what you are doing when you purchase this piece of junk."
1,Absolute junk!,"The whole 5 gallon of water leaked out all over the place. There is no way to tell if the water jug is seated properly when you change it. Pours very slow, there is an awful plastic taste and I am have a hard time returning it. There is no phone number to contact, what does that tell you?You have to deal through email, by then your 30 days is over.I will never buy another item from this company!"
2,not very cold,"If you like cold water, this is NOT the dispenser for you. It takes hours for the water for the cold tap to get cold. Once you get a glass of water from the cold tap, the room temperature water from the jug enters the cold chamber and the little bit of cold water reamining in the cold chamber is instantly warmed up. Thereafter, it again takes hours for the water in the chamber to get cold. If you just want a dispenser for room tempearature water, this is fine. Otherwise, you will be disappointed. I have mine in my office and can count on only one cold glass of water per work day."
1,Total JUNK!,"Unbelievable! The dispenser arrived and did not work! Furthermore this is a total flimsy piece of junk!! The faucets don't work, the bottles are too big and crush the cheap chinese plastic! Avanti needs to pull this off the market!!"
1,JUNK,"What a piece of second hand junk! This was not brand new, someone had it before me. No instructions on cleaning, no information at all. The top Styrofoam shipping protector was taped together, the power cord was loose and just dumped in, It had a smell of plastic and chlorine. And the cabinet was scratched. I should have read the reviews. I will really think twice before I buy anything from [...]"
3,So-so product; wouldn't really recommend,"My first problem with this water cooler is that -- unbelievably-- it does not come with a water bottle as pictured online and on the box. So you get the thing out of the box and can't actually use it! Also, your first several pour-throughs will taste awful; it takes many rinses to clear the bad flavor from the machine.My second problem with it is that no matter what size jug you buy and set atop the unit, the unit only holds 20 oz. of water (the rest dribbles down and refills it as you use it). So it takes hours to cool, and then after only a couple of glasses you are back to room-temperature water.My third problem with it is that the cold-water spigot only lets out a dribble of water, and sometimes (mysteriously) none at all.I bought this unit several years ago (it came with a bottle, then) and it worked pretty well for a few years. The quality seems to have deteriorated since then."
3,Avanti water dispenser,"Service was excellant, 3 day delivery. It works well for dispensing water from a 5 gallon bottle. My only issue is it takes much longer to cool water after you draw 12 to 20 oz. than the information says. I wanted a table top model without a heating element and feel I got a nice one for a fair price."
2,Avanti thermo electronic cold &roomwater dispenser,Water reservoir has a small capacity(600ml) only.Have to refill water oftentimes.The original zero water dispenser broke that's why I have to order a replacement.I might enjoy using Avanti dispenser when it ca accomodate at least 2 gallons of water .
1,"BAD PRODUCT, WORSE COMPANY","The cooler leaked from the start, not a lot, but certainly more than a brand new dispenser should. Within a month it no longer cooled. The company refused to accept a return because I din't keep the box. As if I knew I would want to return it... I am now hoping to get my money back from Amazon through their A-Z program. I should have heeded the reviews and gotten something better."
1,defective water cooler,i am very dissapointed in this product i does not work the way it should at all if it did not cost so much to send it back i would have returned it a long time ago so am stuck with a product that does not work
1,doesn't get cold,I bought this to replace an older unit. this brand did not work nearly as well as the other. Would not buy again. water does not get cold.
1,HORRIBLE PRODUCT AND COMPANY,"DO NOT BUY THIS PRODUCT. THE COOLER DOES NOT LET COLD WATER COME OUT. FOR THE FIRST 5 HOURS I OWNED THIS THE COOLER WOULDNT SPIT OUT COLD WATER, ONLY ROOM TEMP. THEN IT STARTED TO DRIBBLE OUT BUT THAT WAS IT, IT LITERALLY COMES OUT ONE DROP AT A TIME. IF YOU TRY CALLING SERVICE YOU WILL HAVE A 2 HOUR WAIT EACH TIME. THIS COMPANY AND PRODUCT STINKS AND I WISH I COUDL RETURN IT BUT I THREW AWAY THE BOX. SO IM STUCK FILLING PITCHERS UP WITH WATER, THEN PUTTING THEM IN THE FRIDGE TO GET COLD. WHATEVER.....STAY AWAY"
4,wltiv,"Other reveiwers indicated a strong plastic taste. Found this to be true, but the manufacturers recommended procedure for addressing this satisfactorily fixed the problem. It does take a while to chill more cold water after some is drawn off, but it gets the job done. We like its relatively small size and light weight."
2,Takes a while to get cold again after use.,"The first one of these I bought was defective - I would never shut off the cooling cycle and the ""cold"" light would never come on. Returned (they would not issue a refund), so I had to get another one. It works OK, but can take up to 3 hours to get to the ""cold"" setting and stop the cooling cycle. Somewhat noisy when cooling. I might recommend looking for another unit before buying this one."
1,"Lost time, effort and money. Avoid Avanti","I sent one of these to my mother as a gift. She was so excited about receiving it. This was complete waste of time as this was such a poorly built machine. The concept of a countertop dispenser is great, but the product produced is mediocre at best. The first unit didn't work for any more then 30 minutes before all the settings stopped working and sent it back which was a hassle. My mother decided to ""exchange it"" as the concept was exactly what she wanted. I sent her a second unit and it didn't even work at all.I would given this product a zero, but unfortunately one is the lowest you can provide. This product should be avoided unless you have a great desire and passion for wasting time and eating the shipping cost every time you consider trying it ""one more time"". This product has really put a poor taste in my mouth and should be removed from amazon. I discourage the purchase of any Avanti product."
3,Just right for a small office,A nice tabletop cooler for a small office. The time between cooling would be too long for a department with more than four people.
4,decent cooler for the price,This cooler seems to work fine for our family of three. It takes a while for the cooler to recover after you pour a couple of glasses of water.
5,This is an excellent book for children and adults alike.,This is an extremely beautiful and warm book. I have lost the copy I owned and have been looking for it for sometime. I now have a grandson and this is a book I would especially like him to have in his library along with all the other Mousekin books. This book is appropriate for young children and fascinating for adults as well. I recommend this book for anyone looking for a quality children's book that is beautifully illustrated and well written. I hope that the publishers hurry and get more of these books on the shelves.
5,Mousekin's Golden House is a Must Read,"Mousekin's Golden House is perhaps the best Halloween book for children. It has a wonderful ending that children are continually surprised by. Although I like the entire Mousekin series, this one is the best. It can prepare school children for several different fall themes. I am amazed it is still out of print and hopeful that more people will ask for it so I won't have to borrow it all the time!"
5,This just cracked my top 5,"Much props to the Grouch for writing, mixing and producing his own music. Some highlights: excellent recording, the sound is fantastic. Subject matter is interesting and varied. The basslines are the best I've heard on any CD in years - guaranteed to give your subs a workout. Nice variety on the beats but mostly a slower tempo vibe - there's no club bangers on this CD. There are some live instruments, particularly the 2 tracks with the flute and it sounds very nice blended in with the music. This CD is strange to me. I don't even thing I really like Grouch's rhyming style. But the way it's put together with the music all comes together really well. And I mean music; It's not just beats + rhymes, this is a composition. Very well done, Grouch."
5,one of the best hip hop cds ever,"G. Kubrak--what are you talking about? These are not 5 minute laptop productions--each and every track's instrumentation and beats are on point, and his late great father, a professional organ player and guitarist plays on many of the cuts. The musical ideas go way beyond 90% of hip hop cds out there, you comments are totally off point. Not to mention that his lyrics and delivery are nothing short of staggering--I've listened to this disc hundreds of times over the last two years, and at least seven of the cuts on this disc has been my favorite at one time or another. I'm still picking up things everytime through it--Grouch has a LOT to say, so listen up. AMAZING, MUST HAVE CD, period."
2,i didnt like it,"but i did enjoy numerous songs from his previous albums. in todays rap you cannot just be all lyrical with a beat made in 5 minutes using your lap top. i dont want to pay for that. i want to feel good when im listening to music. thats what this is supposed to be, right? music, not reading your poetry to some half ass beats and production.. because if thats what it was then Grouch is the best poet w/ wack beats, but when it comes to hip hop music this just cannot cut it anymore. grouch says he is intelligent so much that his listeners start to believe him and reciprocating. if you want something intelligent read a book written by someone with a phd.. if only grouch had a degree, and a good producer..."
2,Not anywhere near as good as volume 1...,"The first volume of Emma Frost was really cool. To see Emma Frost as a teenager was great. This one the other hand is just stupid.Emma finds a guy whose in trouble with the boston mob, and they get kidnapped and blah, blah, blah.This story did not need 6 issues. Its too long and way stretched out, By issue 3, i was begging for it to end. Its just keeps going on and on and on.Not only that, this series was supposed to show emma's life in her early years, volume one did a great job but volume two, who cares, i felt like the plot was just so unimportant. By the end, you will see the writer (Karl Bollers) wanted to show how Emma got her money to start her new life. But he did not need 6 issues! I feel like he needed to stretch this story arc out so it would fit nice in the tpb. I hope volume 3 does as good as a job as volume 1 and not his boring mess."
4,"Dangerous ""GAMES"".","Recap: Emma Frost has walked out on her troublesome family and is now striking out on her own. Unfortunatly without any of her familys money and trying to develop her erratic mental powers. Emma becomes romantically entangled with a guy who owes money to some loan sharks who are more than willing to expand on thier list of crimes. Will Emma be able to tak care of herself out in the big bad world?? The writing is still good if unoriginal and the story is a lot simpler than the previous installment. The art slightly worse than in the previous chapter, but it is not by any means bad, just...different. SPOILER: in the end Emma uses her mental powers to make her captors believe they are killing each other with guns but they really aren't?? What?? it didn't make sense, why if they didn't suffer any trauma why would they lose conciousness and ""die""? Oh well, Mind games is overall a light fun read. EP"
2,Bad!,"I hardly ever write a negative review, but I suggest you avoid this product.On the plus side, it is a good price for a water dispenser. I was excited to replace my old water cooler with this new one at a very good price.Two problems.1. The water comes out SUPER SLOW. It's half the speed of a my last model. No big deal you think -- but you'd be surprised how annoying this becomes by your 10th cup!2. The cold doesn't get that cold. Again, not a huge deal, but if you like your cold water sort of, well, cold, this isn't the unit for you.Very disappointing."
1,Bum Product,Enjoyed this product for about 3 months. That's when I came home and found it had sprung a leak and ruined my kitchen floor. Do yourself a favor and don't purchase this item.
1,SUCKS!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!,"We thought the first one was defective. So we sent it back and ordered a new one. It heats the entire 5 gallon of water, the fans stink, and the water comes out slow. Save your money!!!!!!!!!!!!"
1,Bad Taste,I'm not sure whats wrong with this companies dispensers - I've tried both this version and the smaller version (replacement) and they both added a very district plastic/metalic taste to each glass of water.The cold water system doesn't work as well either. Amazon should really look into getting rid of this companies products altogher.
4,Stopping Renting from the Water Company,I got this office quality water cooler to replace my rental from the water company. It works great and looks great!
1,Killed my fish,"I bought this water thing 3 days ago, first day, horrible taste, took the water and instead of drinking it, I put it my 55 gal fish tank. Now both of my fish are sick, and dying. Imagine how you would feel if you drank some. It tastes like plastic, it's full of plasticids, which is know to cause cancer. Don't buy this product, don't go near it. Haier=Hater, Fish and Peoople Hater"
1,it's broken right now,"My water cooler is sitting behind me, broken. I came home from work one day and there was water all over the floor. The cooler was very hot, and even the water in the bottle was hot. Needless to say I unplugged it and it's still sitting there. I went to the haier website and there is no repair place within 30 miles ! I live on the SF peninsula where there should be someplace reasonably close for repairs! Anyway, I'll probably just toss it out and buy a brand sold by a major retailer. Very disappointed. It was only 4 months old."
1,Haier Sucks--do not buy from this company!!!!,My water cooler is broken too. Same as all the other reviews. I would contact the Better Business Bureau in your area to let them know how you feel about this awful company.
5,Absolutely Awesome,I love this book...very user-friendly. There are so many practices (including the suggesting time for each practice) that you could choose from and several modifications. The explanation and illustrations are clear and precise. If you are looking for a yoga book...consider this one.
3,TV junky,Ididn't think lone justice was as good as the previous walking tall movie. I didn't think that there was enough action in it. I thought it was kind of lame.
4,lone Justice,"This dvd, is the best action movie I,ve ever seen. the story is great, it tells the tale of an ex cop from a small town who knows how to deal with the bad guys,a man, who when he asked for help from the police, does not get it one has to take the law into his own hands.T hi is one of the best dvds of the walking tall movies I have ever seen."
3,"OK,but not good!","I must admit I was expecting a bit more from this movie than I got. There was no story to speak of-it got chopped up. Also,the chemistry between Nick & Kate was practically non-existent aside from their front porch reunion after she recovered from her wounds. The torture scene was too much. Overall,this movie was not bad-Kevin Sorbo did a nice job with the script he was given to work with,but I can't really recommend it."
4,Underrated !,"This set has never been a critical favorite. I doubt anyone would claim Ashkenazy as one of the great Beethoven interpreters. And yet it makes for quite pleasurable listening. For one thing, we have Ashkenazy's beautiful tone and general finesse. Somehow we have accepted as great Beethoven pianism, playing that ranges from the painfully plain (Brendel) to the downright ugly (Kuerti). But Kempff has shown us that a non-aggressive beauty can reveal another side of this great composer. Ashkenazy is not in Kempff's league as a Beethoven interpreter, but nearly every performance is effective here and shows a real musical fluency. More ambitious Beethoven players (e.g. Kovacevich) often make recordings that totally miss the mark.So, this set would be a perfect for listeners coming to this music for the first time. And seasoned Beethoven sonata listeners might enjoy it as well. Just don't expect poetical profundity."
2,"Just an introduction, nothing more","At first glance this set definetly catches the eye, but as soon as you start listening, one realizes that Mr. Ashkenazy doesn't live up to the challenge.Not only is the sound qaulity below high grade standards for Decca (ie: dim levels), his playing doesn't capture the spiritual, emotional, and dramatic elements of this music. The only thing he does well are the slow movements, which are gorgeous.However, after listening to so many exemplary Sonata sets like Artur Schnabel's, Annie Fischer's and Wilhelm Kempff's, I am left to wonder about Ashkenazy's. He seems to only concentrate on the quality and sound of the TONE...but nothing else (however beautiful it is). But there is no meaning behind his playing, no seriousness! And for me this is the most important in Beethoven.For anyone serious about Beethoven, I cannot recommend this set to do full justice to these profound works. Sorry to be so harsh, but this is my personal opinion."
2,bad Kanon:(,"I really wish I hadn't bought this recording. I just wanted a good recording of Kanon and I thought it'd be just because it was Telarc and a full symphony Orchestra, but to be honest it sounds like they're playing in a large closet with huge sound panels soaking all the resonance, it would've been better if had a concert hall sound I think. I guess the other guy is right about the serenade, I only listened to the kanon and didn't go on. just don't buy this if you want a good kanon."
2,I will never consider reading the other two of the trilogy.,"I hated this book. I didn't mind spending half my time in the glossary trying to work out what the old Scots words meant (despite being a Scot living in Scotland) but Gibbon is another author who refuses to say something in a sentence if he can stretch it to a couple of paragraphs. I know this trilogy is acclaimed and popular so my opinion should perhaps be dismissed if you are seeking a book to read but I thought, 'Get to the flaming point', so often throughout it that I will never consider reading the other two, despite quite enjoying the actual story."
1,Tedious,I really must challenge these 5-Star reviews here. I found this book to be overlong and dull. The characters definitely are NOT rich and deep. I think they are someone thin and vague. There is hardly any dialogue at and what dialogue there is is usually very difficult to understand and when it's not it's boring. This is a story that could easily have been told in 100 pages. And to this is only part 1 of a trilogy...
1,uninspired,"I have to admit that I was excited to get this book, but after thumbing through it I can honestly say that most things were not that appetizing. It's way too gimmicky and most of the meals are laden with processed foods. Seeing as I prefer fresh ingredients, this book was a definite waste of money for me."
4,"Uneven, but indispensable for novices.","Honestly, the book is quite uneven; some recipes are near-inedible, while others are excellent.But in this day and age where few people have the time to cook - and fewer still have the skills - this book is indispensable.There are quite a few cheap and easy recipes here that are better food than what you would get if you spent twice the money and five times the time and effort.There's no better value in cookbooks today."
5,"5 Ingredients, 5 Minutes, 5 Stars","Rocco's new book is beyond perfect for innovative, quick and economical inspiration for any level of cook. It's the perfect complement to ""Flavor"" (which I also highly recommend for more complex menus), making you think to use common ingredients in new ways to expand your repertoire. His effervescent charm and passion for both food and life shine through, making for an entertaining read as well as worthy, usable cookbook. Dishes like the shrimp sate saute make you wonder how restaurants get away with charging $30 for a similar dish, while Rocco gives it to you for under 5 bucks. I have yet to try many more of his recipes (I just got the book!) but I can't wait to get into some more of his sizzle."
3,MIsleading,"When I want five, I mean only five. He does not count seasoning, fat, water, etc. Well if you do not count those, this is not different than any other cook book."
5,Rocco's Five Minute Flavor: Fabulous Meals with 5 Ingredients in 5 Minutes,Purchased for daughter-in-law and sent direct to her in Ohio. It got there on time and she said it was like new. So far she loves the recipes and book.
5,Excellent cookbook for the busy person!,"I'm not in the habit of buying cookbooks, however, this book is a great find. I've tried three recipes so far, and all came out as promised - fast, easy and delicious! I'd highly recommend this book to any busy individual who doesn't want to sacrifice quality for a quick meal."
2,Gimmick,"I agree with the other reviews that this cookbook is nothing more than creative marketing. As a new mom, I was enticed to buy because of the five min cooking time. I can prep holding a baby, but I can't cook with her in my arms. So the less time over heat, the better. However, the recipes consist of a lot of fondue (not a meal, but more of an appetizer), ""ideas"" (brownies w/ sauce on top) rather than real recipes, and too many processed or prepared foods that simply are not widely available (and I live in a metro area!) After reaading other reviews that refer to Rachel Ray I think I'm going to check out her books! At least she uses ingredients that I can find in a grocery store. I've tried several of our specialty grocers and still have not been able to find the majority of the Rocco ingredients. I asked for this book as a birthday gift, and I'm truely saddened to have wasted my mother's money on it!"
1,This book was a Disappointment,"While the recipes claim to be quick and simple, I haven't even tried a single one. There is no nutritional information, and most recipes appear to me to be unhealthy. (I am into healthy cooking.) Some ingredients are hard to find. (I live in a city of about 200,000.) The recipes do not appeal to me. How about chicken with canned Alfredo sauce and cocktail onions? Many ingredients are prepared rather than fresh, which I prefer."
1,There is already a band called orbit that started in 1984.,"There is already a legal court proceding with another band trying to use the name orbit,So I would advise you to hire a lawyer and not get in this mess.The original Orbit is in california and has already put out a record in 84 and another release in 86.Also they have been constanly playing every year for the last 15 years.Warning,Beware."
5,Playmobile Heliocopter,My grandson loves airplanes and helicopters. He just turned 4 and I bought him this heliocopter and the airplane. His older brother who is 11 put them together for him and he absolutely loves both. They were easy for the older one to put together and seem very strudy and well made. I love playmobile things. They allow kids to use their imagination.
5,What an Amazing Voice!,"Lisa Moscatiello has one of the best voices in music today, period. Her voice is what lends continuity to this diverse collection of songs. On Second Avenue she delves into jazz, celtic, and folk, and even gets away with doing an acoustic version of a eurythmics song. Her original material also stands up nicely against well-chosen cover material. One of the best features of the album are the fine instrumental performances. I never thought I would like an alto sax in a celtic song, but it works! Guitarist Dave Chappell lends a unique blues touch to the mix, and Fred Lieder has some gorgeous cello lines. The musician's performances, though strong, don't detract from Lisa's vocals. BUY IT! You won't be disappointed."
3,Enough is Enough,"Ok this book was good, except for the Elizabeth and Sam storyline. How much longer is the author going to drag out this storyline? It's getting to be very boring, and ridiculous. In my opinion, Elizabeth and Sam aren't a very good match for each other because they both act immauture whenever they are around each other. I liked the Nina storyline, I hope that she will concentrate on being single for a while. Chole needs to have a reality check, as usual. The Jessica and Neil storyline was ok, but it was kind of absurd also."
3,lets move along now,"I love this series, and it has become even more interesting. I don't like the Liz and Sam thing. Its dragging on, and I don't even think he is that great. I definitely wish she would move on to someone more mature. And Jess should start dating again. But things become more realistic in this issue. Major tension between Jessica and Neil-what's going on here? I guess you will have to read to find out!"
3,It's been too long....,"Personally, I feel that the Sam and Liz story has been dragging for too long, although it is enjoyable to see the story develop into a true romance, but knowing that both of them blatantly like each other but is not going to tell each other soon is becoming quite a bore. As usual, this book does not draw a conclusion to their story. However, this series still has been a good and simple read as it touches well on college life."
2,Not easy to read (literally),"While the subject matter of this book is challenging, I was not pleased when the book arrived and the pages were meant to be read at 90 degree angle from normal books. That, added with a tight binding made the book nearly impossible to move through. I was also not impressed with the quality of the printing inside. It was far too faded. I felt that the book did not do justice to the subject covered and I ended up returning the book and purchased another book on the subject. I am not trying to be overly critical of the book. I was very enticed by the title and cover, but the way the inside of the book was set up was not near to the quality dedicated to the cover. I think that this has the potential to be a better book if the inside is rotated to that of a normal book and the quality of printing was improved (color printing would be ideal)."
5,Warp 8,"1. The Enterprise attempts time travel. Spock uses the gravitational pull of the Sun and the theory of relativity to go back in time and then forward warp 8 into the future returning to current time.2. Time/space warp suggests that the Enterprise went back into a time in the past then moved forward through time/space loaf to a time in the future.3. The mass of the Enterprise would have moved towards infinite as speed moves closer to light speed. So either the Enterprise moves faster, so it travels at sublight speed, but travel through another dimensional worm hole. The Enterprise upon entering the worm hole would be strip of all its atoms."
4,A fair and balanced look,"Having traveled extensively through Tibet and Sichuan and Qinghai provinces, and lived in Beijing, I was interested in reading a book recommended to me as ""a true look"". First of all, the comments of the first reviewer are absolutely dead wrong. Having read the Chinese propaganda, and really lived the Chinese propaganda, this is not it. Rather, it is one of the only pieces of scholarship about Tibet in recent history that doesn't fall victim to the Western agenda of portraying Tibet as sympathetically as possible. This is a complex issue, and both sides have done their best to skewer public opinion in their favor; however, to accuse these men of simply being mouthpieces of the Communist party is doing a great disservice to what is truly a breath of fresh air. For a good look at propaganda, go to a Beastie Boys concert. I applaud the editors for keeping politics out of their writing. I highly recommend this text to anyone curious about the real situation in Tibet."
4,"Mind-opening, highly informative book on buddhism and Tibet","I write this, provoked by deeply narrowmindede, negative review from anonymous person in Miami. I'm a danish journalist, practicing buddhist through 25 years, finding this book extremely important, because it draws attention to the ""real Tibetan buddhism"" in Tibet today, where courageous and compassinate lamas (like Jigmed Phuntsok Rinpoche)is strugling to reinvoke and revitalize the rich and beautifull Tibetan tradition. The picture drawn in this book may not be fitting the preconcived ideas of romantic old Tibet or the easy standpoint of neglecting the hard and complex political conditions on the Top of the World in favour of support for the popular high lamas of the exile-community. That seems to be the reason why the book can provoke the kind of anger, expressed in the review from Miami."
2,A too-brief treatment for the recreational boater,"With all due respect to the venerable Chesapeake Professional Captains quoted above, this little volume was just too sparse to make a dent in the understanding of most of us recreational boaters who don't already have the text of the COLREGS memorized, though obviously every little bit helps. The author needed to include more quotations of the actual language of the regs in his discussions. The high points for me were the discussion of obligations and liabilities in low-visibility navigation, and finding that some subtle language in the regs is meaningful (i.e., ""vessel"" and ""vessel under power"" are legally significant distinctions, not just rhetorical variants in the text). Everyone who cares about navigating safely will want to read this little tract, but don't make it the last one you buy..."
4,Kershaw keyring scissors knife,"My daughter calls it ""very convenient, ridicuously sharp"". It's a nice little tool worth having one in the car or on the keyring at all times. Pull out one blade, it's a knife, pull out the other, it's scissors. Works well and seems to me to exemplify Kershaw quality in a nonetheless inexpensive item.I have several Kershaw knives being close to the factory where they have an annual pre Christmas warehouse sale. Every knife or scissors I have from Kershaw is very good quality."
3,Deceptive packaging but still pretty good,"At first, I was really steamed when I got this cd and found out everything on it was either re-recorded or live (small club setting it sounds like). But the more I played it, especially in the car, the better I liked it. The live tracks are rockin' little versions, the remakes are true to the original arrangements so they're still fun. Live track example: ""Crystal Blue Persuasion"" is quite good and the engineering on the recording is excellent, so it's a fun recording that would be great for cranking up at a party. A re-recorded version of ""Crimson and Clover"" is also very good, although I still prefer the original classic - some things just can't be improved upon regardless of newer studio technology. So, if you see this in a retail store's cut-out rack and look at the track-listing thinking it's a good deal for their ""greatest hits"", don't be deceived."
5,All the songs are great!,"I love this cd. All the songs are so good. This is a first for me that when I purchase a cd, I love all the songs on it.I hope they'll have a new one soon. I had this album in the early 80's, and loved it. During my moving around, I misplaced it. I was so happy to see I can get one still. I LOVE IT !!!!!!"
1,DUMB dumberAND DULLER,whats beneath the surface jeweled juvenile like most of his work cover blurb delivers more promise than reading descriptive of absoluetly nuthing.. the worse of the worse clap trap un ingenuine disgenius jenie genius.......or idiot saviant auto erratic pre seed pointing in delerium masking despair ....
2,meh,This holster is nice leather the retention is a little disappointing for the sig p239. Seems like it just fits. The clip is cheap plastic. Due to the clips small size the holster moves around on my belt. Not worth its high price.
1,I needed a BOREDOM antidote,"I read this book because somebody compared the author to Clancy and because he was a GA writer. Mr. McHenry is no Clancy. Far from it. The characters were paper cut-outs, the dialogue stiff, and the action forced. Action scenes switched from hotel room to hotel room at the speed of light. A few times I lost track of which hotel they were fighting in. The only comparison to a Clancy novel I can see is that the authors have a 'c' and a 'y' in their names. Can't recommend this one."
2,Code Name: Antidote,It is apparent that Mr. McHenry knows Naval and shipboard procedures. He goes to great lengths to let the reader know that he is up on procedures to the point of tedium. The first half of the book was boring and repetitive. The second half was better but some of the religious discussions came out of the blue and seemed out of place. This would be a book best checked from the library.
4,C'est La Valerie,"Valerie is a pleasant surprise, a country belter out of England, where the Hollies once sang about a ""Long Cool Woman (In a Black Dress)."" Add a fringed jacket and a guitar and you've got Valerie. In my career, I've interviewed some pretty fair singers - Emmylou, Linda Ronstadt, Bonnie Raitt, Grace Slick, Gladys Knight, Joni Mitchell, Tina Turner - and Valerie's right in there, mixing country and soul, her voice full of heartbreak and passion. Sweet dreams, indeed."
2,Utterly Useless,I got these bones so she could have something to chew on without killing her baby (toy raccoon) on a frequent basis. She hardly gives this thing a second look. I pretended to be excited by it. I even pretended I was eating it so she'd want it but it was a no go. I then tried the never faulty peanut butter trick--I put a thin layer of peanut butter on it thinking once she'd get started she'd love it and not want to stop. She licked off all the peanut butter and walked away. So far it still just lays there. She refuses to touch it. What an utter waste of my hard-earned money.
4,"Lasts a very long time, but not that enticing.","Bought these for my 30lb puggle who is a monster chewer. She's hardly dented them after two weeks, but she doesn't chew them too often. No preference for flavor either. I would suggest that you get these when your dog is a puppy so they become their favorite chew early on. Mine has been spoiled by cow hooves, pig ears, and stuffed toys."
5,Durable,"My dogs LOVE these bones. If they aren't chasing a ball, they keep themselves busy chewing away at these. The Nylabone bones are quite durable. Also, neither of my dogs have had any problems with intestinal obstruction while using this product, something I've occasionally experienced with rawhide."
3,OK,Puppy is not in to these as much as I had hoped.It does not seem to keep her interest long enough to have her chew on them.
5,I have a happy dog...,"I don't even need to open the package to have a happy spinning pet. I'm not sure what flavor/smell is unfused with these bones, but my dog turns into a slobbering mess when this package arrives. They last a long time and don't make too much of a mess as they are consumed. The 3 bone package is a good value. Shipping was quick! Overall very happy with my purchase and if my dog was able to comment I'm sure he would give Nylabones a thumbs up!"
2,My dogs don't like these bones----,One of my dogs will eat almost anything and he won't even touch these bones. The other dog is kind of picky so it's no surprise that he won't touch them.
5,Good deal for 3 bones,"These are regular Nylabones that are in the stores, but there are three for about the price of one. They're a much safer alternative to rawhide, and even my Pitbull takes a while to obliterate one. If your dog doesn't take to them, boil them in water for about ten minutes to release the flavor. That usually works. This is a good deal for 3 bones, especially if you have Prime."
3,Dogs Not Satisfied,The bones have sat on my floor for about a week now. I wish I could leave a better review but none of my four dogs like them.
5,as expected,my dog loves these bones. They are good for keeping him busy and keeping him chewing his toys and not my furniture.
5,Really durable,"Good material, they last very long but size is kinda small, at least from what i expected...Our dog has not even finished the first one and we got this about a month ago. I would buy it again!"
3,Bit of a waste..,Bought these for my Aussie and my Springer Spaniel... Neither of them were interested in the lighter colored bones but both of them love the dark one which is still getting use almost a month later...
3,my dogs lost interest quickly.,my dogs lost interest in chewing in a short period of time. now they just lay around on the floor untouched.
3,Dog Chew Toys,my bit bull does not like these at all they are very hard plastic. I do not think this is a good chew toy due to the very hard plastic that they r made from
1,my 2 dogs didn't touch it,"I decided to buy this because a friend told me that small dogs shouldn't be eating regular ""skin"" bones. She recommended me this brand. Now, the bone is hard and feels like plastic... I didn't realize initially but it is really made of nylon with chicken flavor... Ok maybe the name is a give away but I didn't think it was seriously made of nylon until I got the item. Both dogs (a belgium sheppard and a lhasa apso) wouldn' touch the nylabone... And I think they will be better off eating regular skin than nylon anyway."
3,Dura Chew,"I believe that it probably is just my pups, but they aren't crazy on how hard these are. They prefer the nubby Nylabones to these."
4,So far the dogs love them,"The puggle keeps running around the house with these in his mouth, not willing to let go. He can chew on these for hours, which is what I wanted to keep him occupied."
3,nylabone,I must have ordered a different Nylabone chew than usual.. these bones are very hard and not chewable and my dog doesn't want any part of it. I'll have to find the other ones on your website and make her happy again...
4,"durable, durable!",this are great for super lchewers as the descriptions says. this are very hard and not flexible at all. at least my blueheeler love them the first days and then she got bored. eventhough i recomend them and will buy some more soon.
4,"good value after a month, dog still chews on it",we have an intense chew lab pup and this bone has lasted a good amount now..we add a big of peanut butter to it and then she chews for a while..good value..still have other 2 bones to give her after almost a month
4,They last!,"I didn't realize that I could buy ""nubby"" bones, rather than these smooth ones (my mistake). My dogs finally are enjoying them, but I wish I'd gotten the ones with the nubs (bumps?) for quicker interest. They all hate the chocolate bone, so it's a battle among them for the ""original"" ones."
1,Nylabone bone,smaller than I expected Not too happy with them ......... ............... ..................... .......... .. ........ ........... ........... .......... .... .
5,Pleased,"This is my second copy of the same book and this one will be the ""keeper"" for my collection of Constitutional studies books. Corwin is one of the most brilliant minds in understanding the US Constitution and a ""must have"" for any serious student of the subject. I am ""gifting"" one of my students with the working copy of this book and this one will enter my personal library as the research copy. Thanks for the keeping a promise of a great used copy. Well done."
1,Title and authorship of Corwin is fraudulent,"The original work, of which this one claims to be an update, is a three-volume collection of essays by Edward S. Corwin, edited by Richard Loss, which I recommend. This is a summary of the opinions in landmark court cases, with an emphasis on those that Corwin disagreed with and considered unconstitutional. Nothing about this book is authored by Corwin, and, based on his actual writings, one must conclude that he would not have approved of his name being attached to it. This is a rather crude attempt to legitimize the many ways that the Constitution has been and is being violated. Read it, if you must, as revisionist doctrine and what statists would like to have you believe is established constitutional interpretation."
4,ACTUALLY SUPRISED......REALLY GOOD,"THIS CD CAUGHT ME BY SUPRISE. ever since i was introduced to living legends- i have been listening mostly to sunspot jonz, grouch and eligh's stuff. this cd has differ type of production on it. honestly- as much as i love living legends- a lot of their stuff requires a couple of listens before they grow on you.(i blame all the commercial bull i've been exposed to). But- i fell for this one on the first listen! beats are dope, lyrics are very good, what else? his style of rapping is a cross between eligh and murs. basically that means his flows are pretty deep and can make you laugh at the same time. i wished the other legends would approach their new releases in this manner. If grouch had beats like this- man - wow! anyways- luckyiam.psc represents on this. legend fans who have been dissapointed by some of the beats will love this too. but don't forget- psc's flows are better than the average legend! i promise they will suprise you!"
4,Good for the preschool classroom,Some of the songs are great for music and movement. Several of the songs were a little high for my age group (young 3's) but are great for 5 year olds.
4,Love the cream!,"The cleanser would be good for someone with normal to oily skin, but the cream is the real treat here!I rotate these products in with several others in my routine, and I love how this cream works. My skin is always so smooth, and never greasy. Great for nightime, as it has no sunscreen."
3,great skincare cream... disappointing size,perhaps I didn't read carefully; next time will just buy the cream / mositurizer and opt for a larger size.the toner was somehwat drying; I would not purchase this item again.
3,Poor volumn control,"The music is wonderfull, especially the real thunder. Unfortunately the sound is either too low or too high and the volumn control has to be adjusted constantly to hear the whole CD properly."
4,Great read,This book has some common sense advice about how to take your business to a new level. It is well worth taking the timeto read!
3,Doctors of the Church Snippets,"Unfortunately this only wet my appetite to read the whole book or article. etc. that the short few pages this book gave you of each Doctor of the Church. I was so disappointed I returned it as I wish to obtain and read those actual books, so in the long run it was God's way of showing me several of these Doctor's of the Church I was not aware of before, so I have to thank the author for writing it as now I have a whole new world of authors. God bless him!"
5,Danze Melrose kitchen faucet with spray and dispenser,"Product arrived on time.While installing the faucet, I noticed that the copper hot water intake line on the faucet had a slight kink. It looked like someone else had bought this faucet before and tried to install it but did not use a wrench on each side of the copper line connector. I was not sure if the kink would be a problem for me.Otherwise the faucet looked brand new and the chrome surfaces had no scratch and looked real nice. After the install, the faucet works great. The faucet is very sturdy and I like the hi-rise configuration. My girlfriend and I love our new faucet and would recommend this faucet to anybody.I purchased this faucet real cheap, like less than 1/2 the price of a new one at the store. Maybe that is why is was so cheap, because of the kink in the in-take line. But the kink caused me no problems. So I am real happy that I got a very nice faucet for a very very good price."
5,Great Item,"For the price, this set was much better quality than I had expected. It feels somewhat thinner and lighter than a set costing 2-3 times as much, but that doesn't affect looks or functionality. It does drip for a second after the water is turned off, but that is due to the shape of the spout neck, and will happen with all faucets of this type. Output pressure is somewhat better than the model I replaced. It was very easy to install. One word of caution after reading the other reviews concerning kinking and difficulty with the sprayer hose, is to make sure the hose is straight in a nice loop and not twisted when you install it. I haven't had any problem with mine. The only minor gripe I have, and it is minor, is from an aesthetic perspective. All of the 4 items included in the package have differently shaped bases. I'm not sure if this was the plan during manufacture, but it seems kind of strange to me that they aren't shaped to match each other."
1,this cd sucks,"311 I find is usually pretty good but this time there cd was terrible, it was a waist of money to by this cd and i wish i had never bought it. the chorous in some of the lyrics are okay but other than that the cd was terrible. most of my friends who are fans of the band find that the cd does not live up to there previous cds."
3,James Axler is rolling in his grave,"I give up, while the first 30 books were great they have slipped in recent years. I think I first noticed the decline at ""Freedom Lost"" and even then it was bearable. But now its just a rehash. Ryan and Co. come out of the gateway fight a battle, go to the vile, Dean gets caught in a rockslide or is attacked by a mutie fish. Oh yeah, and along the way they make a friend(who has the unsighly habit was being killed just before the book ends). Read Outlanders, therein lies a glimmer of hope."
5,Diaper bag,Love this diaper bag. It has held up for many years. The quality is superb. Would never buy any other bag.
4,Gorgeous and functional!,"This bag is super sweet and girly! I ordered this because my sister in law went thru several diaper bags with her first kid, so with her second kid ( a girl) she spent a little more on a Kalencom and has had it for 2 years and its still in perfect condtition! She swears by it and says its totally worth the money! I couldnt agree more! Its definately worth the money and amazon was a great choice because i found it cheaper then most other sites ;)The ONLY thing im worried about is it wont be big enough..but Im a first time mom and iv heard we over prepare :)"
4,Been using for 1 year....some wear!!,"I have been using the diaper bag for 1 year....the corners are starting to rip, probably can be used for a couple more months but as much as was, I am a bit disappointed. It does clean up very easily and the bottle holder is very thick and does a nice job keeping the bottle warm or cold. Love the inside 3 pockets and the end pockets, great size for cell phone or tippy cups. Holds plenty of gear for 2 kids."
4,love the bag,"The product was exactly what I expected it to be. This was the cheapest I could find, and believe me I looked hard. I saved this website for further use. Everyone loved the bag! I love the bag."
5,Excellent product,"I received by error elliptical version of this cartridge so this review is for Stanton 680E.V3 680 V3 Cartridge (Eliptical)I am a retired DJ just using the cartridge for listening my old collection so I can not give feedback about ""production"" performance. Anyways the product met my expectations regarding sound quality and stability. The only thing I noticed (and actually is mentioned in product literature) is that gain for elliptical version is lower than classical version of 680s."
5,Wonderfully done!,"I ran across this book by accident, and fell in love with it right in the store. It is now my favorite coffee table book, and I enjoy paging through it regularly. I am purchasing additional books to give as gifts.This book has beautiful pictures and witty commentary. Some of these stories will both tug at your heartstrings and make you laugh all at the same time."
1,Amateurish in Writing and Photography,"I have no idea what all the other reviewers are seeing and reading, but it certainly isn't ""Cat Spelled Backwards."" These ""portraits"" of dogs are snapshots that any dog owner could have taken, and what can be considered no more than one or two-line captions aren't even ""cute.""""Lucy D gets wiped out playing games with her brother and big sister in the big yard of their big house.""That's neither funny, nor fun, and laughable in only the sense that I spent 11 bucks on this thing that I will now give away next Christmas."
5,"a ""sleeper""--great fun!","A copy of this book was given to me by a good friend from Portland. As I read through it, I found myself chuckling, both because of the wonderful photographs and the wry commentary. I was prepared to dislike the book, because I thought that a book about dogs might be too ""cutesy"". It was not. Instead, I loved it, have reread it several times, and have loaned it to several friends. Jeff Selis has a wonderful eye and a matching gift for understated writing which is perfect for this book. I hope we see more from Mr. Selis, and soon! Regardless of whether you enjoy watching dogs, or their owners, (or, I guess, neither) you will find this book to be a breath of fresh air."
5,Two paws up - WAY UP- by a cat-owner!!!,"Having thoroughly enjoyed Mr. Selis' enchanting other book, ""Dog Bless America"", I was delighted to find this hidden gem. I found the dogs in this book to be every bit as adorable as the ones in his other book (Dog Bless America). I especially like the clever title. It took me a few seconds to do the math, but once I did, I HOWLED for two straight minutes! As a cat-owner(hi, Mittens!) I feel slightly guilty for having this book in my apartment. But in my heart, I believe even a cat would have a hard time not liking this wonderful, magical book!! God bless you, Jeff Selis, for your always-adorable dog pictures!"
2,The College Board Scamming You Again,"I think anyone can see that their is a huge market for SAT studying, courses, etc... The college board hounds you with programs to teach you about their test and this book is no different. Even in the book it has coupons for its online courses. If this book is so good, then why would you need any more help, especially form the same author?Basically it breaks down to:Pro's: lots of practice (but not a whole lot more then others), written by test makersCon's: Boring to read compared to my other SAT book (Princeton Review), no test taking strategies that aren't common sense"
1,who knows...never got it,"I never received my purchase. I've exhausted all avenues of refund without so much as ever even getting a response. I'm sure the actual producst is very helpful, it just remains to be seen due to the fact I have not received it."
4,good primer,I bought this book for my nephew and now reportedly he's going to ace the SAT. We'll see. But he found it to be a quick study and claims it helped me a great deal.That remains to be seen. BUt he completed the book which is more than he did with other SAT prep books. So it's already ahead of the curve.
3,More original tests needed.,Some of the tests in this book are updated versions of the previous edition. But this is the only real material available. I request that College Board publish a more original version of this book soon.
4,Flawed but indispensable,"Anyone serious about preparing for the SAT needs this book for a very simple reason: it is the only one with real, as opposed to imitation, SAT questions. It should form the core of your preparation. However, the book has a number of flaws-- the most crucial is that there are no explanations of the answers. This is a crock, because you can get the answers, but only by shelling out big bucks for the College Board's online service. This is shoddy scheme,unfortunately, but the book is still indispensible. Books by other companies have imitation questions which simply do not fully prepare you for the real thing."
1,Don't trust in the practice tests.,"Although this book has practice tests made by the SAT makers,that doesn't mean it has the practice tests as hard as the real tests.I put all my trust in it but got dissappointed on the test day due to the extreme difficulty of the real reading passages."
3,Too much writing in the book,"I bought this book in used condition, but I was not expecting so much writing in the book. There were many drawings and the practice questions were all marked up. Some of it was in pencil which I could erase, but the majority of it was in pen. That was the only major problem (some of the pages were bent, but I think most people wouldn't mind it)."
2,This is not the 2nd Edition,"This edition has been preempted by the newer 2nd Edition, which contains three actual SATs. This book is composed of eight ""practice tests,"" and it's apparent that some of the material used here wasn't fit for prime time."
2,Being Official doesn't make it a good guide,"This book is written by the College Board the makers of the SAT so you would think it would be a great resource for all sections of the test. Unfortunately, it is not a great resource for the SAT I essay. First, they promote several misconceptions about their own test (ie all examples are weighted equally which Adam Robinson has shown to be false). Second, the high-scoring essays included as examples have very little in common with each other. Because of this it is difficult to glean a formula for writing a high-scoring essay (and there is a formula as discovered by Dr. Les Perelman of MIT). So I cannot highly recommend this book for SAT essay preparation. I give this book a mediocre rating because at least it has writing prompts from the test-maker which no other book can claim."
3,The Official SAT Guide,"This book NEVER arrived. It was cancelled the same day, reorder from another vendor and also cancelled. Finally, my daughter's boyfriend found her one, almost too late and they studied together. The Guide was helpful but would have been better if delivered and on time."
5,Very useful,"Perfect for any SAT taker. This book reviews all the necessary parts of the SAT. Also, it was written by the makers of the SAT so it is very useful. It not only teached but also provide some practice tests. Very Very Useful!"
5,Great service!,It was just what I was looking for and is very helpful for my tutor and me. Good book to buy.
2,The Only Useful Things In This Book Are The Practice Questions,"I bought this book and was greatly disappointed. The test-taking strategies in this book are only good enough to score an average score (1500-1600 out of 2400). Some of the tips are things that you've heard a thousand times before for not only the SAT but other standardized tests: ""Eat a good breakfast the day of the test,"" ""Get a good night's sleep,"" ""Use process of elimination if you don't know the answer,"" ""Answer the easiest questions first."" If you're looking to score above a 2000 I would highly recommend only using the practice tests in this book and using another better book like the Princeton one to actually learn how to significantly improve your score."
3,Too Easy,"I am working with a rising senior; she and I both feel the tests in this book are too easy and easier than the real SAT. I am resorting to old volumes of ""10 Real SAT's"" and other company's test prep materials."
4,"useful, but no solutions...","College Board's Official SAT Study Guide is the only book with real SAT questions, but it lacks solutions to those questions. You need to get this book too:Official SAT Study Guide Solutions Manual: 2007-2008 Edition"
2,"Ok, but not great",The book didn't seem to be updated much. I liked the SAT for dummies book better for studying.
5,Excellent!,The book was in brand new conditions and arrived very quickly. Couldn't of expected any better.
5,Good Prep,This was a great guide to prepare me for what to expect on the test.The only thing that study guides like these lack is the testing monitor who can be a little overwhelming at times.
4,Great Buy,"It is so worth what I paid, and then some. It explains in great detail and the wording is easy to understand. I just wish the book would focus more on problem areas and not just the whole SAT test. I still think the book will help me tremendously on the exam."
1,Not Worth It,"The Official SAT Study Guidei took that SAT this march, and got a 1560. which I'm sorry but if you bought a review book you'd expect a little better of a score than that. this book is boring and not helpful. the most helpful thing was my friend who took that SAT's last year tutoring me."
1,This is not even funny,"Is it a good book or not? Does it help or you are waisting you time and money? It, baby, depends on what you are lookin' for. If you want to study for SAT then you have no choice but to buy this book. What you will see on a test day is in this book. This writing comes from test-makers and you can (hopefully obviously) assume that it will help. I don't really know what to say here... SAT is a monopoly. Everyone has to do it no matter what. Than, let's see here, comes a book, let's see, from test-makers, hmmm, lots'f profit; isn't 't so?! And we are just their preys, waitin' to be eatten. Dismal, don't you agree?!"
5,great book,"On the first SAT I took, I got a 620 on critical reading, 650 on math, and a 570 on writing. I then bought this book and really got serious and organized doing a little of it at a time. I scored a 700 on critical reading, a 730 on math, and a 650 on writing on the next SAT...240 points! I'm extremely grateful for this book and on my way to a great college."
2,NOT reccomended for SAT studying.,"This book, obviously, is massive. I personally did not find almost anything in the whole of the book, very helpful. It is so wordy and vague at parts that it is very easy to lose interest. I highly suggest one of the test prep companies SAT books. I have ones from Kaplan and Barron's and they are much, much more helpful, and are more to the point."
4,Good Practice,"This is a good book to practice the SAT with, if you use it. It will help to know what kinds of questions are on the SAT when you acctually take it."
2,Official book but needs better strategies,"I thought this is a straight forward book. It provides lots of examples but it is hard to sometimes learn from each questions (students I find keep making the same mistakes over and over).Also, from the test maker I would like to see some more free material since they are making lots of money off of each student that takes the exam. If you are going to pay for a book, check out rocket revolution or Gruber's book for great material."
3,"New SAT, But Not All New Questions","To save yourself some money, don't rush into buying this book. You may not need it. The College Board provides a copy of a complete New SAT test on its web site, which you can download for FREE. This book provides 8 additional tests. However, a fair number of questions are recycled from the guide to the ""old"" SAT, called 10 Real SATs, which you or an older sibling may already own. Also, this book provides only an answer key for each test, not the explanations. This somewhat limits its usefulness."
4,good customer service,We ordered the older version SAT book on a rush because the class our daughter was in wasn't updated to the new text. We paid extra $$ for shipping but the book was delayed in the mail and took almost 2 weeks to arrive. The vendor we used was apologetic and though realizing they couldn't control the speed of the US Mail they refunded our shipping on the book to compensate for the time it took. Classy move. We appreciated their customer service. The book was flawless by the way.
3,Tests but no explanations fo Answers,"Although the book has a good number of sample tests, it gives only answers to the items and no explanation of how that answer was derived. It is a good follow-up after the Princeton Review for the SAT where the correct answers on 3 practice exams are explained fully.Dr. GreerAcademics Upward Tutoring[...]864-542-7622"
3,You get what you pay,"Freight charge was higher than item cost. You get what you pay for. It is only marginally sharp enough to peel a cucumber, but it can be sharpened if necessary"
4,"""A Touch of Class"" pretty much hits the nail on the head","Angel Romero is one of three classical guitar-playing brothers, one of the others being Pepe (who is also excellent). I purchased this CD solely to get the hauntingly beautiful ""Cavatina"" from the movie ""Deer Hunter."" I've been very happy with this recording - the Cavatina is lovely, there are some ""classical guitar standards,"" and some other pleasant surprises. I like the Variations on ""Greensleeves,"" and variations on a Japanese folk song, ""Sakura."" The sound quality is typical Telarc, which I generally find to be top-notch.Aficionados of classical guitar music will especially enjoy this CD, in my opinion, and I would recommend it to anyone who wants some lovely, tranquil music to either listen to or to use as unobtrusive background music."
4,Good for Brainstorming,"This is a fun book and can help you realize what really matters to you, in that you list various things about yourself and your likes and dislikes. It sounds boring, but it's not. I bought it as a journal-writing incentive, and it's been great for that."
3,"Filling it out, not sure why","I'm hoping once I fill out the majority of the pages, I will learn something about myself that I don't already know. We'll see."
4,Take charge of your inner self.,Great way to self-analysis in a very interesting way. I highly recommend it to anyone looking to discover themselves. You will be pleasantly surprised about the process and what you will find out.
5,Listmania,"I bought this book as a gift, so I can't speak for the content. I do know the recipient seemed delighted to have received it. I am sure she will enjoy it."
2,Okay.,Although the concept of this book is a great idea I just couldn't get into all that much. It got boring and monotonous quick.
4,Use this Stacked cover for High back chairs too,"bought 2 of these exact ""stacked chair"" covers end of season from BB&Beyond last year to protect 2 new highback patio chairs that wouldn't be used til next summer, but had to survive the fall rain, winter snow and cold of a Lake Erie Winter. Draw string bottom made it fit good around round swivel base with plenty of height to cover everything and tuck under, without closing off entirely. Going to buy 2 more NOW that I've found them here (BB&Y doesn't have this year)."
2,Pretty bad,"This book depicts the Predators as a barbaric and simple minded race.The Predators are supposed to be a superior technologically advanced race, and their only primitive aspect is hunting for thrill, and even that they do with superior weaponry.This book is also sexist, in part maybe because Steve allowed his wife to write part of the book. The Predator women are bigger, stronger and smarter than the males, according to this book.Then why not send the women out on the hunt?! It goes against all of the Predator films and mythos.SPOILER ALERTThe aliens were way too easy to kill and amounted to little more than fodder. The queen alien was also very easily dispatched.As a kid, I loved the original Steve Perry books, especially Nightmare Hive, but I wonder if I was just young, because this book did a disservice to both Predators and Aliens."
5,A very good read,"If you're an AVP, Predator, or Alien fan, this book is well worth the $8. The story is told mostly from the point of view of Machiko Noguchi, an ambitious woman who can't wait to be promoted off the the dry and dull ranching colony of Ryushi, and Dachande, a vetran Predator taking his unruly students out for their right of passage Hunt. Unfortunately for both of them, things go to hell pretty quick. This book is fast-paced with characters you actually find yourself liking. I highly recommend it-"
4,Buy it for the action but not for additional knowledge of the protagonists,I'm a big fan of all things Predator and Aliens and am always on the lookout for any additional information I can get on both species. This was a great story full of action but offers virtually nothing new about the protagonists. Buy it for the action and is recommended from that standpoint alone.
5,It's the definitive AVP story.,"I really enjoyed this novel. It contained a great plot, interesting characters, and plenty of action. Even though the book primarily gives the reader insight into Predator society, I'm certain that fans of the Aliens series will also find it to be entertaining. I found the parallels between the two main characters to be particulary fasinating. My advice : Read it on the weekend when you've got free time ahead of you, because you won't be able to put it down until you reach the end."
5,surprisingly good!,"I wonder why hollywood didn't adopt this book as part of their film adaptation? This book is certainly a ""must-read"" for AVP fans."
5,Excellent,"I thought that tis book was really good. It really puts the movies in perspectave, especially predator. I reccommend this book to anyone who liked both the predator & alien movies."
5,A must-read sci fi thriller,Prey is one of the best books I have ever read. It is action-packed and just plain a good book
4,Just For Fun,"This was a romp down my days of youth. I remember reading this and wishing for the movie to come out.Since then, they've made 2 movies and they are both something awful!Prey deals with a desert-like planet of ranchers who are raising something like a cow.The Predators travel to the planet to hunt the Aliens. And, you guessed it, the humans get trapped in the middle.The pack of Predators are full of students. They are learning how to hunt the Aliens. Their teachers, who gets wounded, befriends a woman and they hunt the Aliens together.Aliens vs Predator: Prey is based on the Dark Horse graphic novels.It's a very short book, but it brings back the memories.This one was just for fun!"
4,Pretty good read...,"Aside from the suggestive and strong language used in this book, I really liked it.So much so, that I read it a second time.I never really read to many science fiction novels, but this one really grabbed my attention. I would love to pick up the other two sequels of this book and take a look at them."
5,excellent book,This book despite what people say is not a cheap knock off of Predator 2 and its story line. Yes their are some similarities but much of this story is different from Predator 2. This is a much broader story ranging from NYC to Central America and there is more than one Predator involved. The ending is kinda cool. Some parts were not enjoyable be in all it is an excellent story and very enjoyable.
3,Night Ripper,"Very obvious this was an early album... Not as awesome as his later work. I wouldn't reccommend this album, but his other albums are my all time favorite music ever."
3,"Older, but good.","Nothing can top Feed The Animals once you hear it. I bought Night Ripper after listening to FTA only to be a little disappointed, but hey, Rome wasn't built in a day and you have to get your feet on the ground one way or the other. This is not the best he has put out but it certainly isn't bad. The tracks are shorter, averaging 2 to 3 minutes, and the songs within the ""mash up"" go on a little bit longer but overall I enjoyed it. If you are a fan of this genre and Girl Talk you will be a fan of this album."
4,Girl Talk - Night Ripper,"OnNight Ripper, Girl Talk has perfected his unique blend of sample-collation. The album flows smooth, like a river of melted chocolate. The individual tracks don't stand out, but they're not meant to. This is as much about the blend as it about the groove. A few mixes pop, however, like the MIA/Kanye West/Candyman monstrosity of ""Summer Smoke"" or ""Bounce That,"" which sounds recurs again on this next album,Feed the Animals. Girl Talk also adds his own electronics into the mix, such as the synths on ""Hold Up"" or the wobble on ""Give and Go."" But more than that, Girl Talk is a pop magpie, taking little bits here and there and stitching them together. Here, finally, he's made his first nest."
3,Remember Stars on 45?,Remember Stars on 45 back in the early 80's?..This is sorta the updated version of that. Instead of 70' and 80's dance hits and Beatles songs strung together on the same beat..this is a pop smash up of top 40 radio mostly from the 90's to the aughts. Its ok to listen to..but not something you can jam all the time..it would wear quickly.
2,Not as great as Feed the Animals,"As far as DJ mixes go Girl Talk is one of the best out there.I have Feed The Animals and I LOVE THAT CD! I was excited to listen to Night Ripper, but I gotta say everything doesn't come together in all these mixes as smoothly as Feed The Animals.Save Yourself the 10 bucks and get Girl Talk's next cd instead!"
4,Hooked on Everything,"Keep this album at arm's length as long as possible and see how long before you're in its embrace. Owes as much to the ""Hooked on Classics"" genre of the 70s as it does contemporary mix n' mashes. The tracks manage to convey two ideas at once, and just as often, two truths about the same idea, as when the a 1970's chorus of ""I love youuuu..."" is matched with the 90's hip hop chant, ""we want some pu**y..."" Any song is as good as the next but why not try Bounce That which seems to hit a special kind of transendence toward the middle. Not suitable for children."
1,"Skip this Import, Get the Domestic",This import CD has the same track listing as the domestic U.S. CD but charges twice the price.Go buy the domestic CD instead.
2,This is so so...,"I would recommend that anyone interested in GOOD mash ups check out Z-Trip.....He's definitely legit and his work is way more available (and a lot of it he makes available for free legally via the internet)...... Z-Trip is the man, girl talk is BS......"
5,jump starter always on time,I bought this jump starter a few years ago when my original one got stolen. So far it has served me and my neighbors very well. We had a flood recently and I misplaced the charger 2 and half months ago and it was able to start my neighbors car immediately and it was not fully charged. Can you tell me where I can get another charger?
1,Trance. I hate trance.,If you like trance...you will probably like this. I picked up a copy not knowing that the Armada party was primarily trance. Waste of my money.
3,A Little Disappointed,"I read somewhere that this collection contained the original, extended LP version of Hungry Like the Wolf. Wrong. It's not here. It's the US CD version, which I already have. If anyone can tell me where to find that version on CD I'd be grateful. That aside, the collection is impressive as it contains lots of obscure tracks that I've never heard of. I bought it for 5 bucks, so I really can't complain. However, I'm still on a mission to get that extended version. I won't stop!"
2,Not so essential to me!DO NOT BUY!,"hello,I bought this album in 2003,What a waste in time!no worth it!This has nothing new than any other collection of geatest hits by DD except for a few incerpts of simion talking about the early days of the bands etc.Not much more,such a waste in money!Just stick with the greatest cd by DD ."
1,.,Don't overlook the fact that the package includes only one side of the cable...you need to buy two packages for left+right.
5,Great rig.,This is my second Miami Classic and love it. Great quality leather and perfect fit for my Glock 17. Takes several adjustments to get the right fit but once you have it fitted perfect its all good.
5,B Dazzle Puzzles,I have come to love these puzzles. The are generally tough to put together. The package says 4 to 99. I haven't seen any children that could do it and it challenges most adults. I love the challenge and have bought many.
2,Spend a bit more,"Earplug fits depends on individuals I guess but sound quality and low volume is not so subjective. I jog with ipod and had several different models. This is the worst I had. The volume is low and one side went deaf after jogging 2 days. I don't sweat a lot so donno how it went short. It could be the quality of the wire. Anyways, my recommendation is to spend a bit more and try another model."
2,This broke my heart.,"Firstly, potential readers should be advised that this is a book by a feminist, with a feminist agenda. Letters are about the blood, sweat, tears, of mother/daughter relationships, and are mostly about terrible and unresolved conflicts in those relationships. Very few letters merit the review by the Boston Herald: ""This is a book rich with words to warm the soul and stir the heart of the mother/daughter that there is in every woman."" I didn't find them warming--I found them depressing. Why would it be heart-warming to hear a daughter telling her mother: ""You can poison your own lives if you want to--just leave me out of it. You were adults long before any of us, and Annie and Pat aren't even that yet, but we've grown up tainted by you at every turn""? (p.235)Mothers blame daughters and daughters blame mothers for each other's choices.I really see nothing deep and meaningful about this--just heart-rending that they can't seem to relate in a way that doesn't damage each other."
3,nice dance music listening,"was looking for MATT DAREY ""beautiful day"" by accident ordered this title, was still pleased with this title,,,but still having a hard time locating ""beautiful day"""
4,Another Cute Book From Little Simon Inspirations,"A Special Thanks is written in the form of a rhyming prayer and is centered around a blond-haired girl. Her parents are on a few of the pages with her. I like how her father has dark brown hair, and her mother has light brown hair. Many animals are often on the pages as well, especially the girl's cat. The book is in the shape of a book, and the entire story takes place in and around this home. The pages have fun shaped tabs that make them easy for a child to turn. The pictures are simply drawn, but are colorful and filled with smiles. The last page is definitely the best. It shows the girl praying and says, ""Thank you, God, for grass, sun, and trees. A special thanks for making ME! For loving and caring and all that you do, I'm most thankful, God, for YOU! Amen."" The J name is not mentioned, but I always add that in the end. :-)"
3,Overpriced,"This video is a re-do of an earlier one that I've had from the 1980s. It is useful as an introduction to a conversation now takiing place about ""historical trauma."" As a teaching tool, it could be use to talk about historical trauma experienced by blacks in combination with a short segment on Native America historical trauma (genocide, boarding school, stigma from stereotyping and misrepresentation). Other videos on this history ought also be considered: ""Slavery by Another Name,"" ""Traces of the Trade--A Story from the Deep North,"" and Our Spirits Don't Speak English--Indian Boarding School."""
1,too short,length of program was only 15 minuetes... wasn't worth the money...returned this item weeks ago...hoping for refund...
5,The funniest Schickele piece ever!,"My experience with the 1712 Overture is similar to Victoria's (in another review). I was listening to the car radio when I heard the dissonant pile-up halfway through, and almost drove off the Interstate.It should be noted that the Amazon listing is incorrect. The 1712 Overture is in reality conducted by ""Walter Bruno"" who is actually David Zinman. It is most assuredly not conducted by Bruno Walter (can you imagine that?), who died in 1962.Highly recommended."
4,P D Q on form again,"P D Q has quite a cult following among the 'cognoscenti', and others may know some of his works without being aware of it or why. Much of this is fun listening if you have that kind of mind &/or background, and has the virtual ring of period authenticity.Classical music, like any living corpus of cultural tradition (eg religion, sport & politics) should be well capable of laughing at itself. Others have done so successfully (Hoffnung, Spike Jones, the Comedy Harmonists et al.) and PDQ follows in a worthy & rollicking tradition!"
2,Weak and Tired!,"I was hoping that this would be a great motiviation tool for running but it turns out to be just the opposite. The recording quality is shabby at best. Not to mention the fact that there is no consistency. The tracks are not made from one group during a PT session, but from different groups with different paces on each track. Ridiculous! The cadence callers seemed eager yet inexperienced and thir lack of rhythm and endurance was evident as most seemed out of breath to begin with (screaming at the tops of their lungs....not sounding off)! One would be better off trying a Marine cadence or Navy Seals instead."
4,Youre 50?!?!?!,"This ""gift"" was for a woman that just turned 5o years old. A great gag gift as an add on for a real gift!"
3,Only for epic metal enthusiasts,"I only have one real problem with this cd, but it is one that pervades throughout every song: there is way too much clean singing. The singer has great black/death vox, but you only get to hear them for about thirty seconds at a time in between two minutes of crooning. Other than that, the album is pretty good. The music is great, even with some cheesy guitar work. Some of the songs at the beginning of the cd are pretty driving, like Ocean's land, even with the dichotomy caused by the clean singing. The normal singing that they do in foreign languages is good, too, but most of it is in English. Still, this is a very solid cd, and if it weren't for my vocal bias I would have given it a much higher score."
4,Very good combination of Arabic music and Metal,"Orphaned land are one of the bands that created their own original style of music with the combination of Death Metal and Arabic instruments such as Oud, Kanoon, Tabla, Rek and many more instruments. Beeing a middle-eastern and a listener of classical and new Arabic songs and music, I realized that Orphaned Land used many classical pieces of Egyptian songwriters and composers, for example the song ""Norra el norra"" was completely taken from the Egyptian musician ""Karem Mahmoud"" and the original title of the song is called ""Samra ya Samra"" The song refers to a brunette woman which the singer fell in love with but Orphaned Land changed the meaning of the song and its language from arabic to hebrew. Highly recomended for people that love originality.Peace to all."
1,1 is too good for this crap,This collection of crap should not even be classified as metal. There was one good song on the entire album. The vocals are way to soft. It's great to see bands from the middle east come out and try there hand at this but these guys just need to stick to another area of music.
5,One of the great Classics!,"Oedipus Tex & Other Choral Calamities is one of the must haves from PDQ Bach. This album has some of his best stuff on it including the title tracks and one of the funniest songs he has composed ""classical rap"" this is well worth one's time to check out."
5,Gotta have this one if you love Hawaiian music,"We bought this CD in Maui last year and it's one of our favorites. Never before has there been so complete a musical, visual and written package embodying the music, sites, history, and spirit of Hawai'i. We really enjoy the beautiful visual images of Hawaii when we play this from our computer. Pure Hawaiian is a perfect blend of the very best in contemporary Hawaiian and Island music, slack key guitar and traditional Hawaiian chants. You'll enjoy listening to sweet sounds of Keali'i Reichel, Isreal Kamakawiwo'ole, Gabby Pahinui, and 15 other Hawaiian musical artists as your mind drifts to a warm sunny beach on your favorite island. The variety of artist's and the range of Hawaiian music is what sets this CD apart from most of the rest. This is a must have for the Hawaiian music lover and excellent choice for someone who is buying Hawaiian music for the first time. Much like Hawaii this CD will leave you longing for more ..."
3,"good material, the book itself is the problem","As I expected, this is another great release from White Wolf. It fleshes out the Dark Ages setting a lot better than the last edition. But that's now what this review is about. Why only three stars for such a great book? The binding is a serious problem. The physical book has obviously been skimped upon. Open it, the binding cracks audibly. I give it a month until I start losing pages, and I take good care of my books. I've asked around, and it's definitely not just my copy. They're all defective in the same way. Very disappointing."
4,An upgrade from the Original,"If you have the old version of this book, you need to invest in this one.Better artwork, rewritten powers that make sense, and continuity! Oh Continuity!"
2,Lacked personality,"This book was very generic. It did have color pictures and was organized well. 64pgs of material. Seperates out species, recommended for a beginner that wants to get familiar with different types of shells. Does have star chart for rare-common, and typical length of shell. It is worth the three bucks, but nothing to rave about. Has a Murex Venus Pectin Comb, and clams, lambis, and other commercial shells that you usually see. I guess that it is a pocket companion. Leave it in your pocket if you want to identify more deeply."
3,Doesn't look like photo,"The saddle I received is much wider, more of a full-seat comfort-bike triangle than the racing style with a narrow front section as shown. For a comfort-bike seat, I prefer the Cloud-9 brand, which I can ride on all day. This one got uncomfortable after ten miles, but I had it on road bike, and it's really not the correct shape for that."
4,Greek Religion: Archaic and Classical,"Burkert's work on the Greek Religion takes the reader beyond the classic Bullfinch Mythology into the real nuts and bolts of religion in Greece and the surrounding areas. Instead of dwelling on the gods, he shows the reader how the Grecian citizen would worship on a day-to-day basis; who was important in the religious society, what was taken care of by the common man within the family and within the community.A very well written piece and a generally good resource for research."
4,"A scholarly, well-balanced look at Greek religion","Walter Burkert does an excellent, well-researched job of presenting ancient Greek religion as it really was, drawing heavily on archaeological findings, classical texts and literature. He is skeptical and rational and does not veer off into flakey New Age Pagan tangents. There is a plethora of rich information here. A must-have for the serious Greek culture student."
1,"Ordered, didnt work, sent back, received replacement, didnt work, sent back!!!","I thought this microwave was a bargain. When I received the first one, I set it on the counter and realized that it wobbled. Apparently, due to poor manufacturing, the base of this microwave was uneven. I contacted Amazon and they promptly sent out a replacement. Before its arrival though, I thought I could use the wobbly microwave. Thats when I discovered that it continually lost power (I checked it on several outlets). The side of the oven also would get very hot. I boxed it up and returned it. Today I received the replacement and (surprise! surprise!) it wobbled also. I tested it in different locations just to be sure it wasnt the counter. Im sending this one back also. I contacted Haier and they said such problems are unusual. I'll give it one more chance. Third time's a charm, I hope."

3,A so-so book to a terrible operating system,"I bought it, read it, and gave it away when I moved on to Windows 2000 (and stayed there). Like most the ""Special Edition"" book series, some to most of text for ""Windows ME"" is lifted from previous editions (it borrows from Windows 98) and cobbled together with the new material/features of Windows ME.The book is an elaborate introduction for people completely alien to Microsoft Operating Systems and Windows ME but a bore for those already familiar with even the logic of Windows. Unfortunately, no amount of information gleaned from this book will make Windows ME work any better."
5,Galco pocket holster,This product was of the best quality. The service from the vendor was excellent. Will shop with them again soon .
5,Puccini's arias beautifully performed as instrumentals,"If you like opera, you want this disk around because you love these melodies and want to hear them at times when it isn't appropriate to listen to the whole opera, or the vocal presence of the singer might not be appropriate for a particular setting. If you hate opera, here's your way in--you might already know and love these melodies from hearing them from popular sources, and if not, you will love them when you hear them.The music has been tastfully arranged for sections of the full symphony orchestra to carry the melody line. Eric Kunzel is an expert at performing this sort of music, and the Cincinatti Pops Orchestra is at its peak of perfection. These are emotional moments in the operas' stories, and the sheer beauty of the music will give your home lots of real class."
3,Not my favorite,"Tender Torment was recommended to me on a Amazon Discussion as a favorite bodice ripper, it was okey and I have read better. It was originally written in the 1970's and was the oldest historical love story I have read accept for the classics. Lots of rapes and close call rapes. I didn't feel the love between the characters -more ownership and intensity than deep true love. I like these kinds of stories with jealousy and the whole bodice ripping thing and search them out, but I felt sometimes in Tender Torment, it was too much and unnecessary to this old school love story."
5,Great Watch for Husband!,My husband likes easy on and off watches and doesn't like to spend a lot on them. This watch was perfect and he liked it a lot. So far it works great. Thanks again Amazon!!
4,Little Disappointed.,"I love Might and Magic. I have played 6-8 and was very excited thinking this was a new game. Save your money! Amazon did not do a very good job of representing this game. What you are buying is 1-5 to include 6. I already have 1-6. Returning it is not an option as it's costing me postage to send it back. Plus 1-5 are so antique looking, they are just too tough to even work playing. The graphics are poor. Might and Magic 6 is a great game, and I would recommend it to anybody, but don't buy this game. Just buy 6-8."
4,"The most complete Might and Magic I, II, III, IV, V and VI collection.","This is an awesome pack containg 2 CD collection of Might and Magic I, II, III, IV, V and VI. If you want to play all the games from the beginning, this is the right package. Included are colourful maps for the six games, manual and strategy guide for Might and Magic VI.What I don't like about this pack is that it is cheaper version of ""Might and Magic VI: The Mandate of Heaven Limited Edition"". In comparison to the better version the CD's are not holographic but plain gray CD's, the maps are of smaller size, the manual is in black and white compared to the colorful manual of the Limited edition.Anyway it is great addition to your Might and Magic Collection."
5,Good value,"I bought these towels a while ago. I still have them now. They have stood up to 4 children and 2 adults and one puppy...along with trips to the pool and beach and multiple washings. They are still soft, retain their color, and haven't bunched up or fallen apart. Very good product."
1,Not what I expected,Very disappointed in the cheap quality and dull color. It doesn't look as nice as what they show on the internet. I returned it for a refund.
5,Lovely,This is my favorite classical guitar CD: the music is beautiful and everyone that I have played it for has loved it.
1,Bad choice.,"Here we come across the old ""Segovian"" style of playing,which on certain works is quite grotesque.In the years of Segovia there wasn't any debate on how to interpret old music,yet still in our days we ""know"" (mainly through texts of each period) how the work was interpreted in each original period.In this CD Angel Romero ignores completely the ""rules"" of baroque music, giving a romantic aspect over Bach's works, which for the experienced listener is quite annoying.Especially while playing the Chaconne (From Partita No.2 BWV 1004) he makes those romantic vibratos which kill the piece.The Romeros in general are outstanding while interpreting latin american music and contemporary guitar music,for example Rodrigo's Concerto d' Aranjuez (among the greatest guitarists world wide),but when it comes to Bach...Do not buy this CD!"
5,Beautiful!,The pieces are well-selected and played amazingly well. Angel Romero is a very accomplished classical guitarist. The music is enjoyable to listen to--romantic and melodic.
1,THIS WAS A HUGE MISTAKE!!!,"AFTER READING AND LOVING """"NINEMILE WOLVES""""---THIS ISTHE THIRD BOOK AFTER THAT THAT I STARTED TO READ. I MADEIT THRU THE OTHER TWO---BUT---NOT THIS ONE. AFTER 90 PAGESAND FOUR NAPS---I SKIMMED THE REST OF THE BOOK AND FELLASLEEP---AGAIN!!! THIS IS NOT FOR ME. I STOPPED!!!"
3,Richard Brautigan meets Jim Harrison,"The author tries to be both larger than life and ""hard as dirt"" and falls through the cracks in the plot, as well as the unbelieveabilty of the characters. This plot, weak at best, is further disrupted by the voice of a poorly crafted narrator that may endeavor to educate us on Geology, but manages to beat the reader senseless as if pounded with a stone mallet. Too bad, as the Yaak area of NW Montana deserved better. This is the author's first book, and since then has improved immensely. Read his later works and leave this one to the Rick Bass diehards."
1,"Stick to non-fiction, dude","Rick Bass is a high-profile proponent of the ""Listen to me, I'm serious"" school of nature/environmental writing, which has given the whole genre a bad, boring name. Bass has definitely written some elegant non-fiction, but by page 80 of this novel, I think I started twitching. Or something. I kept wanting to say,""Show, not tell, dammit!"" And stop being so damn portentous. And pretentious. The macho thing has gotta go, too. The woman actually carries the guy on her back (Mommy, Mommy!) Puh-leeze. Then he's got to fight with Daddy. Granted, I was trying to read this self-consciously written tome while on jury duty, so perhaps I was a bit testy. But the ghost of Ed Abbey is throwing beer cans out of his rocky grave at this one."
3,Enjoyable but a bit disappointing,"For me, the most realistic and enjoyable aspect of this book are the vivid descriptions of the landscape and the seasons. Rick Bass has an impressive familiarity with the natural world. The book is also populated by a number of interesting characters, and the plot is intriguing as well, though not entirely believable. I got distracted (and bored) reading Young Dudley's geology journals, and I just couldn't see a good reason for having it interrupt the narrative. Further distracting are some characters' behaviors which really stretch credulity, particularly over-the-top Dudley and overworked, ""soulless"" Matthew. I found this book to be alternately enjoyable and irritating. Not sure I'd recommend it."
4,A Fascinating Novel!,"This book will take you in and cause you to feel as though you are living beside the characters. It's a fascinating account of oil exploration and snowbound life too. I'll admit that there are a few surreal moments, but they didn't keep me from wanting to find out what was going to happen on the next page. Giving this to an uncle who has enjoyed Barry Lopez's writing."
2,A disappointment,"This book is more for the person who already knows the material that will be contained in the book. Each time I was excited to read a section, I was disappointed in its content. Don't get this book if you're looking for more of an explanation rather than dictionary definition."
3,It's alright...,"I don't know what I thought this album was. It's not really the style of music that I normally listen to, but I did like some songs. I seem to always skip ""Presence of the Power"" because it is annoying. I just didn't get it. The good songs on the CD are: ""He Knows Your Name, Right Here-Right Now, Inside, and This Rugged Road"". I would have changed the order of songs, but hey, everyone has their opinion, right. If you are into music like this, you may enjoy this CD. I guess I thought it was something else than was it is."
5,This beats manster cable Y adapter!,This Acoustic Research Adopter definitely beats the Monster Cable in price with out compromising quality.
4,Try some peace instead of war...,"Nah, Mr. Bailey's flame has not fizzled! Burn white hot like More Fire? Nah, but this new found sense of subtlety does not mean this set don't smoke. Nobody delivers words quite like Capleton. He erupts moments into a ballad. I say the word ""ballad"" loosely. I guess the question to ask is, is Capleton getting soft? No, only older and wiser."
2,Short for a Lucerne,All three wires for the back are the same length in this set. Factory they are not on a Lucerne. The wire for cylinder 6 is about 6 inches short.
1,Bleccccch,"I saw this movie for the first time a couple weeks ago and it was so bad I don't really remember much more than checking my watch every couple of minutes wondering how much more time I had to spend on this awful movie.I don't recommend this movie unless you have a real jones for Antonio Banderas, and even then, rent Spy Kids, at least the movie has a little bit of a plot."
1,Make it stop !,"Some people liked this?!? I liked Die Hard by the same director, but I can't find anything to recommend about this movie. What good is action without a plot? Who are these characters? Nothing was explained beyond the barest minimum. You have been warned...."
2,the 13th warrior,"The 13th warrior was an ok movie. I rated it two stars because its not really the type of movie i'd normally like to watch, I'm more into comedy and chick flicks. Other than that it's a good movie to watch after reading the poem Beowulf. I think it relates well to Beowulf because it is pretty much the same story line, only with a few differances like they don't fight grendel instead they fight these creatures. The creatures are wierd. I suggest if you read Beowulf in class you should watch the movie as somthing to relate in class. Overall its a good movie to go with the poem."
1,Very Disappointing Movie,"The movie trailer appears to portray a lot of action sequence. However, the movie turned out to be very boring and most of the scenes are in a dark setting, making it hard to capture all the ""limited"" action sequences. The story is very simple and based on a ""Grendel"" monster myth. I enjoyed the Star Trek Voyager version more. Definitely: DO NOT BUY or even rent."
3,Really 3 1/2,"This is a very interesting movie. It is kind of religious, in the part at the end when everyone is praying to Allah. It is full of gore, but it is a really dark movie, full of darkness. I enjoy the beginning where he is in Arabia, and he goes and runs away from the Tartars. I don't think that is the best combo for a movie- Arabians and Vikings. I enjoy also when Ahmed teaches the Vikings his skills from before, with his swords and such. Finally, I like the battles probably the best, because there are a lot of them, and they often last for long, and they all happen in kind of the same sequence, where first mist drops over the villiage, then an injured child comes out of the mist, then torches appear, then the battle begins. A very odd and brutal film."
2,don't bother with the edited version,"I don't know about the full-length, but this version was a terrible excuse for a movie. The idea was good, but the plotline was dissapointingly simple and the characters badly underdeveloped. Nor was it very realisitc. The movie fails to build up an emotional rage against the anatgonists, who are also simply created with depth. The fact that the directors copied real artifacts and ancient dwellings found in France and the Middle East shows their lack of originality. After two excuses for battles, the movie ends abruptly. It could have been much better."
2,Lots of Discrete Surround,"The only redeeming value this dvd has is the sound. Otherwise, don't buy it. The plot is weak and is nothing compared to the epic that braveheart was. The romance that is alluded to in the trailer is all but absent. Cover boasts a Crighton story and MacTiernan direction but even these don't spare this movie."
3,Mediocre Action Movie,"13th Warrior is a ""just OK"" action film. It falls victim to repetitive ""action"" editing, such as sweeping close-ups and dark shadows to cover silly costumes. The plot was an after thought, and Antonio Banderas is far too Spanish to play a Muslim. The action scenes where fine, and it was no better or worse than average. This movie really could have been more."
2,Vikings Shmikings,"PLEASE, IF YOU HAVE READ THE BOOK THERE IS NO REASON TO SEE THIS MOVIE. YOU WILL ONLY TORTURE YOURSELF WONDERING WHY THE VIKINGS WERE PROTRAYED SO POORly. This movie sould be banned in Minnesota."
5,The 13th Warrior,Fascinating. Then again - when did Antonio Banderas not make his character entertaining and interesting?
4,Gets Better With Age,"The movie was a bit of a flop at the box office, but I suspect it will find a better life at the video store. Many people were disappointed because they expected an action-packed Banderas vehicle set in a sword-and-sorcery world. What they got was a very unusual film where characters speak in several languages. I had mixed feelings when I first saw it. But I've watched it several times on video since then, and I like it better each time. I suspect it will still be standard viewing when the rest of the '99 box office has been forgotten."
2,"Almost, but not quite...","Antonio is put into the shoes of an Arabian who is the last and the 13th warrior to be chosen to assist in a rescue mission. It has the atmosphere of braveheart and robin hood (swords, flaming arrows, battle scenes, vast landscapes,) but it lacks the depth in plot and in the characters that the other movies of this genre have. The potential was there, it could have been a great movie, but it just didn't make it."
4,Enjoyable...,"I agree with most of the reviewers that this movie is too short. I have a hunch that a lot of good stuff ended up on the cutting room floor. I have read the book and once you get used to the style in which it is written it is an enjoyable read. When I first viewed the movie (13th Warrior), I did not realize it was taken from ""Eaters of the Dead"" till I was halfway thru the show.I think the actors turned in solid performances and Antonio Bandaras gives a fine perfromance. I list this as one of my favorite movies for watching on bad weather days."
5,A too short of an adventure.,"We had not heard a thing about this movie, so when the family sat down to watch it, we had no preconcieved notions. We watched this movie bring this far away place, time and characters convincingly come to life. There where no irritating characters, without exception, these heroes you can root for. We could have watched another hour easily, it actually would have given the director more time to develop the characters and their relationships.As for the DVD aspect, the picture is crystal clear, the sound is excellent.Features? What Features?"
4,an under-rated movie,It has a good story and good visuals and sound track. The dialogue is a little stilted but works. The only real problem is that it seems to have been badly cut. There seems to be a better movie lurking behind the screen.
4,thrilling and beautifully directed,"this is a new version from the way old classic Beowulf, pitting 13 warriors, including Banderas against the Eaters Of The Dead and its based on Michael Crichtons best selling novel and its directed by John McTiernan(Die Hard 1 and 3, The Thomas Crown Affair). the actors battle real and the thrills and the scenery are superb"
5,"The book was fine, and the movie is finer","I must admit that I am an avid fan of the writings of Michael Crichton. This movie is based on his story, ""The Eater's of the Dead.""It is well done. Antonio Banderas was very well cast in his leading role.I have seen it five or six times, and enjoyed it more with each viewing."
4,Director's Cut?,"I loved this movie but realized, early on, that it was savaged in the editing. Can anyone tell me if they are planning on releasing a director's cut of this film?"
2,The 13th Warrior,This would have been great if Michael Chrighton left John Mcterian's cut untouched . What you have is a film of potential fantastic set pieces reduced to weak conclusions. This reminds me of David Fincher's vision of Alien 3 being compromised by studio executives. A great book transfered to a afternoon time filler; what a waste!
4,Not quite Beowulf,"Strangely similar to the over 1000 year book Beowulf, the 13th warrior is an interesting and engaging anlmost epic film. The action is more then sufficient and it shows a rather interesting theory on how many legends such as the ones that inspired Beowulf could have begun."
4,Lo...there do i see my father...,"Lo...there do i see my father...lo, there do i see my mother, sisters and brothers...lo.... a very good movie...and i am not even fond of antonio...there is humor...action...and interaction...go beyond the beginning and let yourself get involved...i think you will like it."
5,it's real,"This movie isn't a fantasy -- it's about real things -- courage, and living life with great intensity. When Banderas kneels in the mud to pray for the ability to ""live the next five minutes well,"" I got goosebumps. And when the Vikings, led by Bulvi (sp), who has almost literally come back from the dead to face his ultimate foe -- and ultimately Banderas -- step out to face the enemy's last charge -- the movie transcended film and move to the mythic level that permeates real life -- if we let it."
1,one star is indeed one too many,"Let's face facts. This is a terrible, terrible movie. We have to guess that all involved in this project are hiding. Really, I'm generally quite easy on movies, but this endless stream of uninteresting battle scenes with pointless dialogue and no discernable plot is perhaps one of the worst movies ever made. Sorry if this seems harsh, but I just don't want anyone to buy it unknowingly."
2,SAD...,"AS a fan of action, epic and medieval movies, of course I'd rent on the spot a movie directed by McTiernan, with Banderas as the main star and based on a Crichton's book. But, apart the amazing fighting sequences and good performances by the Norsemen, there's no history here."
3,"Come back Kirk Douglas, all is forgiven","I read somewhere that this movie was considered to be Vikingsploitation. Well it certainly was no David Attenborough special! On the good side the use of language and the costumes and props gave the story a good feel of Viking life. All the characters were believable (even Banderas) and the story was simple. However, the greatest evil that faced our heroes was pretty poor at its job and whetever tension that was developed early on in the movie dissipated pretty quickly. This is not a bad movie, just another disappointing one. Another movie that gets puffed and hyped up and then fails to deliver. I just wonder how many more movies will end up being nothing more than a version of the Seven Samurai transposed over space and time?"
2,Banderas shouldn't have taken this part,Antonio Banderas just wasn't convincing as an Arab. It looked like Zoro playing an Arab. It also didn't make sense why he was chosen as the 13th warrior. How was he the key (why a foreigner)? It also wasn't a very strong ending. There were some good fight sequences but not enough to carry this movie.
1,Major Dissapointment,"Its rare that so many talented people get together to make such a forgettable film. It could have, and should have, been much better. Not enough action, not enough plot. The critic who compared this to Braveheart should have his head examined. If you must see this, wait until it comes out on network TV - not worth paying for. What a waste."
1,A Huge Disappointment,"As a Banderas fan, I looked forward to this movie. But he was not his usual charming, quirky and dashing self, and the story line was just plain silly! I will say, though, that the sound quality of the DVD was terrific."
1,This is one terrible movie!,"I was dragged to see this movie, and it was a waste of $6. The acting is completely unbelievable, the plot is mediocre at best, and the battle scenes are just bloody, with no real point. The stereotypes about Islam got really old, so did the preachiness about how one forms ""brotherhood"" in battle. I've heard this is based on ""Beowulf"" (which, frankly, isn't that great, either), and if it is, that's too bad, because the filmakers missed the point completely. Don't waste your time; I'm sorry I did."
2,Kind of boring,"There's a lot of action, some violence with gruesome scenes, and a lame sub-plot romance involving Antonio and a viking woman. It's worth renting but not buying."
4,"Not all that, but still a great!","I love the movie! Don't get me wrong. It was great, but I thought it was kinda sick that all the underground cave men wore bear skins and rode horses? How many bears were in those mountains! And did they steal the horses or find them? They also seemed pretty stupid considering the fact that they were terrorizing this town and pretending to be ancient animals out of a legand, but maybe I have said to much. Even with all these mistakes it was a great movie and I will be proud to add it to my collection!"
4,Action/adventure,"I went into this movie expecting not to like it, yet i was pleasantly surprised. this movie is not an epic by a long shot, though it does at times try hard. the action is overall good and the film work not bad. but for me it was the characters that make this film worth watching. the way they interact and what they believe in and why they do things was well portrayed. it is not your typical fantasy/adventure film and for that alone it is worth giving a watch. there are some plot elements that are left hanging which is a little disappointing and a couple of big ones. but overall i enjoyed watching it and i can't ask much more from a film than that."
4,Surprisingly Good!,"This movie truly surprised me. I was expecting an action-fest flick with bad dialogue and no character development, but that wasn't the case!Rarely in Hollywood do we see these Beowulf-type, medieval flicks, and to see good acting and character development on top of Braveheart-type action and beautiful landscapes is refreshing. It has a simple story, but the story is played out beautifully. I only wish the film would have about 20-30 minutes more to deal with a few subplots that it should have gone deeper into.I especially like the casting on this. Maybe they could've picked a better lead to portray the 13th warrior (Banderas), but the other lead warriors are great! No big name US actors, mostly Danish (I think), but they do a splendid job (especially their leader and second-in-command).Trust me, if epic warrior flicks are your thing... then you gotta see this film."
3,See Seven Samurai Instead!,"Did Michael Crichton ever come out and admit that he stole most of this story from ""The Seven Samurai""? Because the parallels are indisputable:A small (enumerated) band of sword-wielding warriors comes to the defense of a town ravaged by another gang of evil warriors. They build a fence and gate around the perimeter of the village, with wooden spikes pointing outwards. They go to the ""old person"" for guidance and wisdom. They leave the confines of the village to perform a surprise attack on the enemy camp/cave, losing a man or two in the process. The final decisive battle takes place at the village again, during a torrential down-pour. I just described both movies simultaneously!!!The difference is, Seven Samurai was better written, better acted, and better directed."
1,DVD was fake,I purchased DVD back in November and I just gave the gift this past weekend. The DVD will not play and upon further investigation the DVD is a fake and there is nothing on it.
4,The 13th Warrior,"I have watched this movie dozens of times. I like the action and charcters in the movie. The story line is good. Over all I liked the way the friendship developed between the characters. There was no mushy stuff, but good action and scenes."
3,A good action movie but a ok drama,The action part of it was pretty good. The drama part was so-so. The plot and story outline was incharesting and inchreging but I rate this movie 3 stars. It is really avrege. And nothing special.
1,POINTLESS AND DULL,"Maybe I didn't watch the same movie, but I found THE 13TH WARRIOR incredibly pointless and dull. While filmed sumptuously and with a decent amount of action scenes, there was little substance in the plotting or in the limp characterizations. Who were these ""eaters of the dead?"" All of a sudden the Vikings are speaking English, obviously for the benefit of its audience since translator Omar Sharif wasn't going to be around to translate. Michael Crichton is a gifted writer, but I don't consider this one of his shining moments. Antonio Banderas wears much too much eye make up in the first part of the film and the gifted Diane Venora is wasted in what amounts to nothing more than a cameo role. Listless and lumbering, I don't recommend this one at all."
1,13th isn't your lucky number,"I could go on and on for 3 paragraphes about how bad this movie is but you probably won't believe me . I was warned too but didn't believe it either , wandering what could go worng with Antonyo ( Desperados ) Banderas , big production , sword fights and fantasy story so I rented this movie - I guess I deserved it ."
2,This movie does a disservice to the legacy of the Northmen,"The 13th Warrior although fairly entertaining, does a major diluting to the rich and brutal pagan culture of the Vikings, much as the movie version of Whitefang wimped out on the true brutal version of Jack London's novel. Despite their small numbers and the fact that the Viking era only lasted approximatly 200 years; the Norsemen were the most feared and fearless warriors in history- this was mainly due to their bleak and apocalyptic religion (Odinism). This movie paints a cartoonish existence out of these great men from the far North. To best get a feel for the mentality of the ancient Scandinavians, listen to and learn the modern culture of Nordic Black Metal."
1,Harmless Warrior,"What a tremendously disappointing movie...I admit I wasn`t expecting much anyway, still I thought it would be better than this mess. What could have been a compelling and epic story about vikings ends up wasted with random fight sequences and the lack of a visible plot. Antonio Banderas tries, even if he hasn`t a proper character to play. In fact, this movie hasn`t real characters at all, just cardboard, one-dimensional charicatures. A shame, since director John McTiernan (""Die Hard"") could certainly do better than this empty and uninteresting waste of celluloid. This is a pseudo-movie, since it seems that the story never really begins, making for a useless cinematic experience.A good one to avoid."
1,where was the fast forward button when I needed it?,"I thought the movie would be worth watching simply because Antonio is in it--I was wrong. I kept watching because I thought ""this has to get better."" I was disappointed on that account. Several of the co-stars are wonderful--bringing humor into a dark, corny movie. But I too often found myself rolling my eyes mumbling ""yeah, right."""
2,Scenary is only thing going for it...,"Definetly not worth buying, maybe a rent if nothing else is available. There was no character development at all. Disappointment in plot. If you want middle age swashbuckling, I would stick to Conan."
3,The Battle Scenes are New and Good,"THE 13th WARRIOR was trimmed down from a much longer book and longer filmed version. Some reviewers say this has hurt the movie. But really, the only good thing about this movie is the new battle scenes, battles we haven't seen before by Norsemen on horses wearing bears' heads. Quite scary to see a horde like this coming at you! And a wonderful restraint from doing fantastic things. What you see is what really might have happened. Good guys get killed as well as bad guys. The movie is a bit slow between battle scenes, and the incipient love interest goes nowhere (nor should it). Further trimming down might have helped, but the scenery was so well filmed that it kept your interest (like the first technicolor Westerns). Bottom line: a solid three-star movie, worth seeing but not worth writing home about."
3,"Hack, Slash, Rip.......","Although I have great respect for the talents of Antonio Banderas and Michael Crichton, there was deffinatly something left out of this movie. All of the charactures were 2D.....you had know idea what they would really be like if you were to meet them face to face. The cinamatography was very incredible and some of the scenes were entirely memorable.....bloody......but memorable. Also, dispite the fact that The 13th Warrior wasn't extreemly deep, it was, at the end, extreemly satisfying."
2,Great Concept; Poor execution,"First of all, the plot is definately interesting. I also did like some of the battle scenes and the art direction.There are a lot of things missing in the movie however. The characters were not fleshed out enough and they appear more to be like cartoon characters. Also there were some plot threads that were left unexplained (Like why did the Bear monsters dissapear after the first intial battle).Given the amount of talent that was used in the making of this picture, this is a huge dissapointment."
5,awsome!,"I think this was Antonio's best movie yet. It is packed full of suspense and non-stop action. It has it's gory moments, but hey, what action movie doesn't. This movie is set back in time to the Viking era, but with a twist added by Antonio, who is from the Middle East. Antonio is asked to be the 13th Warrior, and they go to the north and help out their family against an unknown enemy. Considering some of the latest movies that have just been released I would say this is a 10. It is definitly a one time must see."
3,Mistakes in Review!,"Mike O'Hogan makes a few mistakes in his film review here below. The Vikings were speaking Old Norse not Gaelic. I took Old Norse in graduate school a few years ago. They are clearly speaking a Germanic language (""andere mann"" etc), not Gaelic. The movie takes place in Russia and Sweden -- not in any Celtic area. The chronicle of Ibn Rashid is real (read it years ago) and was adapted by Crichton for Eaters of the Dead (which was made into a movie as the 13th Warrior. Ibn Rashid traveled among the Rus Norsemen and witnessed their funerary rites.I wish the deleted scenes were at least on the DVD, but they aren't. There are two or three subplots that just never made it to the final cut."
5,Packed with creepy stuff,"This is an awesome album. It starts off with thunder crashing, running footsteps, a gate creaking, the wind howling, a cat screeching, a door opening, a woman crying that she needs help....and then SCREAMING! And then straight into track 2, the overture to 'The Phantom of the Opera'. Wow! The rest of the cd also features 'creepy' music from various sources, such as Alfred Hitchcock films, like Psycho, various classic works like Rimsky-Korsakov's 'Night on Bald Mountain', and also some other creepy sound effects. A good album not only for Halloween but I dare you to listen to it during a dark night with a thunderstorm raging outside."
4,Just one thing missing...,"No argument here with the five-star reviews. Entertaining program, well-played music, and exquisite sound. However, there's one glaring omission- Dukas' ""The Sorcerer's Apprentice,"" which is so much in the spirit of this program. This is ironic, as Kunzel had already recorded it with the same orchestra on Telarc, and there was sufficient room for it on this CD."
3,Chiller CD,"Item was new but description did not mention that the CD was physically and permanently marked/stamped with ""PROMOTIONAL"" in red and covering some of the CD information."
3,Good for sound effects,"This cd is not what I thought it was going to be, but still a good one if you need creepy sound effects."
3,Classic - Hold the Chills,"This is a fine collection of mostly classical themes.Some of them have nice creepy moments, but on the whole, it's just some solid music. Not something to buy if you want really ""spooky"" music, but worthwhile for some interesting listening."
4,Good Metal,"Good sound and a nice band, I'm enjoying so much this album!Only one thing: the box where you put the CD was broken... and I have to change the CD box!!"
5,An Herb Book For All Seasons!,"If you want just one book devoted to herbs, this is the one for you. Not only does Adelma describe the various herbs in her 50 gardens at Caprilands (it used to be a goat farm in the 1920's when she and her husband moved there), she tells some great stories related to the plants.Adelma's lunches and lectures at Caprilands were legendary. This lady deserves more press. I have never met anyone like her. I had the opportunity to spend a few days with her about 20 years ago. I was amazed at how much she knew about herbs and life in general. I will bet that if you read this book, you will want to order all of Adelma's many books. They are all great reads."
1,Awful,"I don't care how low the cost of this computer is, I will NEVER buy it. Why? Because the eMachine that I bought (this model) literally was overheated. The fan was running, the cables were plugged correctly, I'm not sure what I did, but it just overheated, and it froze. I turned it back on...nothing...at all. I could see lights on my PC, and hear a few start-up noises, but nothing. I checked my monitor, nothing, everything was plugged in perfectly. Luckily I was able to returned this. If I wasn't, I would've wasted lots of $$ on a non-working computer. I could've sent it for a new one, but OOPS!, it was a Saturday. I forgot that eMachines doesn't care about customers on Saturdays. So I returned it to where I bought it and got my money.AVOID EMACHINES!!!!!"
2,Great Idea but Doesn't Work Very Well,"I'm so tired of buying batteries, so I thought this generator would be a great solution. Unfortunately the light isn't very bright so it's not of much help at night."
5,Professional Musicians With Outstanding Sound,"I have seen the group many times, and have never seen such a combination of talent on one stage making beautiful music together. They engage the audience and their music has a quality that could get even those who are near paralyzed dancing. Amazing live, amazing CD. Also HIGHLY recommend the earlier CD Hi-Fi Latin Exotica which has a more Middle-Eastern quality to it. All of their music is great. The sometimes overlooked bass player/songwriter Paul Mrozek is my favorite of the group, but all of these guys (and gal) are very talented."
1,Disappointed Customer,I purchased this exact item from a Target and it was a complete mess. I only purchased it because it was the only 'stainless steel' microwave oven at the time in their store. The 'stainless steel' is plastic. It's an imitation and you can tell. The quality of the oven is poor. They should remove this product from their line of merchandise.
1,It's acually less than one star!!!,"In addition to every thing written by I_heiden, I think the microwave that was shipped to me was a factory refurbished item. It had scratches all over the plastic (fake stainless steel)and of course the door didn't work. Don't even take a chance on this manufactuer. I expected more from Target."
3,1 more inch,"I have no idea if the product works or not. The problem I had with it is that I had exactly 12.5 inches of shelf depth, and the microwave's dimensions stated a 12 inch depth. To their credit, it is true that the microwave is 12 inches deep. Unfortunately, the chord that sticks out of the back of the microwave gives it an extra .75 - 1 inch of necessary back end real estate."
2,Falls apart too easily,"I bought a bunch of these and a few 3 packs of Brawny durafresh sponges.The soft side of these sponges rub off on any mildly rough surface while the Brawny durafresh sponge doesn't. For example, I used the Scotch-Brite to remove a spot on my wall and instead of removing the spot, it added blue pieces to the wall. The brawny didn't fall apart at all. I threw away all these scotch-brite sponges and now only use the Brawny sponges.I don't think amazon sells the durafresh sponge but if you want quality go with them. I'm very picky when it comes to cleaning products and I know quality when I see it.I wouldn't recommend this product."
2,these sponges suck,"I've used the rectangular scotch brite sponges since as long as I can remember.Unlike those, These curved sponges fall apart quickly.The glue that holds the green scrubber fails prematurely, and the sponge separates from the scrub.Given the horrible quality, these are way overpriced."
1,It Ain't What It Use to Be !!,"I use to swear by these things til you(3M) changed the design and make up of them!I noticed a few weeks back when I needed a new package of Scotch-Brite's, something was different about the new ones. Old ones had a textured surface on the sponge side (but not no more),and then the blue scrubber seem different as well.It does not clean ,like it use to do ! Nor does it stand up to normal use like the old ones did.I am not going to pay for top quality and to get seconds throw away items(@#$%).These are just junk ,fall apart and split apart within a week ,which has never happened before with me . I use to wear them out but never did they ever separate like these new ones do.I will not be buying scotch-brite, I do better buying the stuff at a dollar store, lease I know what to expect."
3,Good but....,"The book is great on the maps but there is a typo on page 111. It states "" Just as he is about done, you face another enemy: Trandoshan elites."" I'm not sure if it's my book or what, but there is no such thing as Trandoshan elites in Republic Commando. But what you DO face are Geonosian elites, and yes there are those guys in the game. Overall I would buy the book. Everything else is very accurate and detailed."
2,"Okay, but not neccessary",the guide for this game does not really reveal any additional information for the game that you won't get playing it. I wouldn't really bother with it.
3,Recommended for fans of the Gremlins,"I first read this book years ago, at the same time as the film came out. Being too young to see the film until it came out on video, and being a great fan of the first film, Gremlins, I was delighted to be given a copy of Gremlins 2, and finished it off within a few days.That was years ago, and I'd thoroughly enjoyed reading the book. Looking over it again now, I can't believe I didn't noticed how satirical the style is, and Bischoff doesn't ever go more than a few paragraphs without throwing in another sardonic comment, or personal reference about a celebrity.This book is funny, though, and if you liked the mischevious characters from the first book, or if you are a fan of the film, then you will probably enjoy this book too."
2,Adequate,"Cheap unit, not well made. The metal work is not the best. Care had to be taken when attaching the glass shades. The thread fit for the bulb was marginal as well. For a moment, I didn't think I was going to get all three lights to work."
5,Very interesting,"This book is very interesting and actually the best book for KCA. This book goes throw the second premis in detail but it skip the first premis as ""self-evident."" The problem is that the first premis is really important--specially it is physics not philosophy-- for KCA, but the rest is perfect even though I don't agree with him."
1,Check your premises,"Pick the right premises and you can prove anything. All universes are ultimately, if not proximately, random vacuum fluctuations. No information is passed, so they are not ""caused"". The first premise is therefore false. That said, the book becomes a decent argument against the existence of a single god, but I can do better, faster, without quoting Aquinas or any other philosopher."
3,This item was a gift.,"As far as I've been told, it's working fine. I bought it for my mother, who is 80 years old, has arthritis and can only operate a dial controlled microwave."
2,Okay for the price,I only paid like $17 for this so I bought it for our RV. It's noisey and the power selector knob broke off pretty quick. It did manage to operate as our primary house microwave for over 5 years until one day when it caught fire. What can you expect for $17?
1,bad experience,Just tried my new microwave. So far I tried 2 bags of popcorn at high and lowest and both burned. ????
1,Poor Quality,The Glass Tray Cracked in when used for just 10 days.DO NOT BUY THIS PRODUCTLOW PRICE POOR QUALITY
3,"Nice price, nice appliance","Can you beat the price? And the style is pretty good, even with its old fashioned dial for a timer and its small size. We are not really 'microwave people' but we gave in when we needed to heat baby bottles, and this one has fit into the kitchen nicely. Recommended."
2,Stopped Working After 2 months,"Was quite noisy initially. Then one day it stopped all noise and started working quietly, so so quietly that I felt something fishy. Then on the 3rd day of 'quiet' operation it stopped all together !Not recommended. But if you want want a temporary solution for a cheap price, go for this."
4,"Works well, I bought another","I bought this unit from Amazon almost a year ago for my high-energy, 1 year old yellow Lab. After 1 year it is still working and I bought another unit in case this one dies. The sensing mechanism works very well. She can do a slight whine and growl without activating the spray, which is fine. The collar is durable enough for occasional wear; it shouldn't be a 24/7 collar anyways. Only problem I had was a result of the company switching nozzle types/sizes on the aerosol refills. I had to remove the rubber o-ring on the refill port to get the latest refill cans to work without leaking everywhere.Pros:Works as advertisedHas lasted longer than I expectedBattery life better than expectedCons:A bit bulkyA definite buy if you have a barking dog; spray works fantastically for my Lab!"
4,Kino + Arena + pop = The Urbane,"File under ""pleasant surprise""! I've become a huge John Mitchell fan (Arena & Kino) and thought I'd check out his ""pop"" effort, only to find it has some of the melodic/symphonic sweep that I love about the best of Kino and Arena. There's a track on here that seems like a pop version/dry-run for ""Losers Day Parade"" from the later Kino album. Some of it is throwaway soundalike pop stuff, but some of it has a great prog edge to it. People should not combine LSD and crack and then write reviews, as evidenced by the review that mentions this as being PUNK. Not a whiff of punk anywhere that I can find, just great melodies, excellent musicianship and compelling vocals. Try it!"
4,Thoroughly enjoyable read,"I enjoy westerns and love mysteries. So, when I stumbled upon this title I had to the download it. After all, the price was right! Like many of the older books available for the Kindle, it is very much a period piece. The old stereotypes and ethnic labels are present in the text. Regardless, I know what to expect and enjoy these old reads.This story of a cowboy accused of murder, turning amateur detective, and working to clear his name (and his friend's name) is a methodical tale with the Western dialect and locations. It is an easy read and a fun story. Don't expect a brain twister, but Western genre action, personalities, and a decent amateur sleuth tale. It was well worth the price!"
3,Not what I thought,I was still waiting for something to happen when the end came.I could not stop reading the story. Seemed like the story took place in more modern times not early 1900's.Ray
4,Western Mystery - Go Figure,Good story. Enjoyed a different approach to old west stories. Simple mystery but enjoyable reading. Will look for more books by Mr. Raine.
3,Bargus,"I ordered these for my husband as his physician recommended this type of product.Pros: the cost was comparable to other products, it is a natural product, and it does dissolve under the tongue as indicated in the product description.Cons: the taste. We will try another flavor in the future."
1,Awful taste,"I can't really say whether these helped at all because peppermint and the taste of liquid vitamins is not a good combination. It takes forever for them to dissolve, so you get to taste it thoroughly."
5,A delight,"I first listened to this in High School about 17 years ago (wow do I feel old now) and the delight of listening hasn't changed much. The sound is nice and clear, and I finally have an unscratched copy :)The only thing that's changed to detract from these songs is my view on WWII, that it's become a cultural phenomenon where the Allies won people over into thinking it was some kind of noble war, not a terrifying atrocity that they themselves started at the end of WWI, ultimately forcing a stand-off again in WWII.Basically, it's war propaganda music (propaganda which still wins people over because OMG HITLER) and this part makes me quite sad that we don't think more critically as a people and a country.As marches they are wonderful, though."
3,Great sound,"Telarc has always been known for ""sound"", and this is no exception. For those, however, who buy it for the Victory at Sea music, you'd be better served buying the re-mastered Victory at Sea CDs. It's the difference between an original and a re-recorded version."
2,Horribly Expensive,"I'm sorry, but this is horribly expensive. Up until the latest news about the forthcoming increase in prices of essential grains I could purchase this size package at my local grocery store for $4.15. At a local superstore it was priced at $2.86 for a 24 oz. package.Lauren"
4,A ground-breaking work,"This book should be required reading for all those interested in relations between the Catholic and Orthodox Churches. Williams does an amazing job of explaining how Thomas Aquinas and Gregory Palamas - the most ""Western"" and ""Eastern"" saints possible - had similar, and complimentary, views about the important doctrine of deification. Of course, it is no surprise that Palamas was a staunch defender and explicator of deification; however, Williams shows that Aquinas too believed and wrote about this doctrine, in a way that is consistent with Palamas.My only complaint is that this book reads a bit like the dissertation I assume it was. At times the reading is very difficult, and Williams should have done more to make it more accessible to readers."
1,Propaganda,"A standard digest of the usual Greek propaganda. Actually the Greeks and Persians were closely linked culturally and Greek mercenaries played an important role in the Persian military. Historians typically underestimate the extent of the ties between East and West, and vice versa."
3,Almost History,"If you like historical fiction, you may enjoy this odd book. A good deal of it consists of the kind of speculation bemoaned by Barbara Tuchman: ""As he gazed at the receding coastline, Napoleon must have thought back over the long years...""--that sort of thing. Of course, Holland has an excuse: the primary sources for these events are often sketchy and contradictory. Holland just picks the account he thinks most likely and kind of fills in around it. No existing record says Xerxes was ""horified"" (as opposed to, say, angry) to hear of a revolt; Holland just figures he must have been when he heard the news. And maybe he was."
2,Overly pretentious and bombastic language,"I don't understand why history writers always have to use weird syntax, overly flowery vocabulary and awkward grammar. It makes it so difficult to get into a grove. This is a such a compelling subject but, Holland's narrative never takes off. There is plenty of background information about ancient Greek culture and Persian history. However, Holland falls short when trying to draw conclusions about impact and ramifications. The synopsis of the book misleads you into thinking that the book will provide insight into how this ancient history impacts us today, but it doesn't. It's straight up history. It's interesting history if you can stand the stuffy writing."
1,Exchange it,"I run marathons, so I got this as an amazon gift.Didnt like it too much and exchanged it forThe Battle of Salamis :The Naval Encounter that Saved Greece -- and Western Civilizationby Barry StraussMuch nicer book on the battle."
4,Vivid account of a superpower's defeat,"This fine book tells the story of an earlier war between East and West. In the fifth century BC, a global superpower was determined to bring order to what it regarded as two terrorist states. The superpower was Persia, the terrorist states Athens and Sparta. As Holland points out, ""even the mightiest empires can suffer from overstretch.""He mordantly notes, with a passing hit at the British state's `special relationship' with the declining USA, ""There was no greater source of self-contentment for a subject-nation, after all, and no surer badge of its continued servitude, than to imagine that it might have been graced with a special relationship with the king."""
5,Worth twice the price,"I could not put this one down. This is an exceptionally well written and informative, factual narration free of cluttered commentary. Bravo!"
5,Buy this book !,"Wonderful introduction to ancient Greek and Persian history. Incredibly accessibly, with lots of great pictures of locations, artefacts and maps. The key highlights of this book are really brought to life by the expert writing of Holland. A book everyone should read."
2,Great story ruined by twisted syntax,"And it was a with a clause that Holland prefers his sentences begin with, and the reader finds that it is a straight forward narrative that is lost, as the reader stops to untangle each sentence before preceding to the next.I've finished the first volume of Norwich's brilliant History of Byzantium. I want to balance it with an equally deep understanding of some of the eastern Empires, and had high hopes for this book. It's a fascinating topic marred by a groan-inducing text.I suspect that the twisted syntax is used partially to cover up holes in the narrative."
3,Reads a bit like a text book,"I like my history books to be in third person, without the historian intruding much into it. I felt the start of this book was like a textbook where the teacher is concerned with inspiring the kids rather then teaching them and for that reason I did not give it a four stars. Having said that it is a good book and is well written.From reading it, it appears that the Persians were in too much of a hurry as such they made mistakes. I think there is a lesson here for todays world when superpowers are looking for quick solutions to a problem."
2,History or Age-Old Bias?,"The book is thoroughly (I dare say) entertaining, in an old folks-tale kind of way, but I genuinely regret that it lacks scholarly value: It is a mere narration, not discussion or analysis.It is disappointing that the likes of Mrs. Cross (see below review) are touched emotionally (it eclipses TRUE scholarly endeavors). What Mr. Holland or Mrs. Cross fail to mention is how the 300 Spartans held their slaves against their will to fight alongside them against Persia. I wonder if that is ""valour"", or ""glory"".Perhaps if the tolerant Persia had fused with democratic-like Athens, the world would have been spared of the Athenian Empire, or even the merciless Rome."
5,Awesome Telling of the Greek and Persian Conflict,"Ancient history is usually dry, slow, and difficult to relate to, but not this time. In ""Persian Fire,"" Tom Holland does a remarkable job of telling the story of the conflict between the Greeks and the Persian Empire. The book starts with an intro to the Persian Empire and its origins with Cyrus, and then Darius, and Xerxes. The next sections deal with the Spartans and then the Athenians. The book goes on to tell of the multiple conflicts between the Greeks and the Persians as the Persian Empire sought to conquer the West and the Greeks fought for survival. Everything about the book is masterfully done. It is scholarly but at the same time accessible for the average history buff. For a work of history, this book is surprisingly a page turner. If you ever had an interest in reading ancient history, this is a wonderful place to start. Highly recommended."
3,Short comment.,"I must admit that I havent read the book yet, but after reading the comments I will acquire it. The fact that it has only received bad ratings from reviewers with farsi-sounding names is a good sign. In my book that means it is not a glorification of an earlier or recent Persian/Iranian empire. I might be wrong, the future will tell."
1,Barbarians?!!!,"Throughout the book, the author glorifies the greeks, and refers to Persians as barbarians. This is not exactly an account of history from a neutral point of view."
1,Persians ???,"The book is about Persia, yet we are not told who the Persians were, where did they came from, and so on !!! The land of ""Persia"" was the Elamite civilization, so where did the Persians come from ???"
1,summer vacation read,"Although this book sounds like a history book, in reality it is not. Just read it for fun if you are on vacation and want to kill time. Dates and names are somewhat correct but it is by no means serious scholarly work. This book is imagination of Mr. Holland told in narrative style. He has good story telling ability, not factual well-researched historical account. Read it for fun so you can throw in some names and dates in cocktail parties, and sound intellectual."
5,It's not all Greek,"Tom Holland manages the unlikely feat of making Darius and Xerxes sympathetic and understandable. Too often portrayed as sadistic megalomaniacs in this book they get a fairer deal, Holland explains the motives and beliefs of the Persian kings and their reasons for wishing to tame those pesky Greeks.As for the Greeks, well, they fairly jump off the page. None more so than the devious and brilliant Themistoceles. Founder of the Athenian navy he may have been and also the man that probably saved Greece but he was also an unprincipled and self-interested rogue. In painting these vivid portraits Holland uses frequent footnotes and what I loved about the Kindle was the ability to check the footnote and reference with a tap on the screen and then return quickly to the narrative.The most entertaining and informative book on the Persian Wars since Herodotus."
2,How can a cheap plastic wheel support 100 pounds rack?,Assembly is straightforward and finish of the material is just about acceptable. The wheels are of very bad quality. I was rolling the rack on carpet for 2 feet and the plastic on a wheel fell apart. Now I use a book to support the rack in place of the wheel. This happened 10 minutes after assembly.Disappointed.
1,don't install the casters!!!,"Seller was great, cabinet is well built except 3 of the casters broke off on low carpet on 1st use. About 60 lbs in cabinet. Save yourself a headache and get 4 metal roller ball casters from Lowes for $3 ea."
5,Great console stand!,Overall very happy with this console stand. It was shipped and packaged securely. Word of caution...the box was heavy. The instructions were clear and easy to understand for assembly. It took two of us to assemble it in about 90 minutes. The finish is nice and it's made of dense particle board.
4,"Pretty good, best used with hard flat floors.","I am happy with my decision on this. However, I wish it where somehow more rigid, and yet, did not have 2 or 3 fixed shelves, which provide more rigidity. I would like the bottom shelf higher for my full tower computer entertainment case (what I had in mind). I also wish I had wooden floors or larger oversize wheels (the over sized wheels would be cheaper, and I rent). A metal framework in the rear, with a huge full length power strip could have done the trick. Basically it does not get along well, or stand up completely straight on carpeted floors. A flat solid floor would help it keep a rectangular upright shape (think front door jamming, crooked to wall, and easy mobility). It's nice looking and otherwise fairly solid. The price wasn't bad either."
3,Good for the price,"We bought this storage cabinet a month ago. Overall it's worked well. We had some problems with pieces being missing when it shipped, but the company sent them to us fairly quickly at no cost to us. The directions to put it together aren't so hot. It's heavy, so make sure to have at least 2 people with you when you move it/put it together. The glass door doesn't like to stay closed all the time. Ours is a little sensitive. Other than that we like it. You get what you pay for."
4,Just what I was looking for!,"I looked for something like this in furniture stores locally, but everything I saw was massive and expensive. This audio rack was just what I needed, was easy to order, easy to assemble, and was delivered in record time. Now I know where to shop!"
3,Very Nice A/V Rack,"Very happy with this A/V rack. Cloth back on unit to allow for larger components and will still hide them, but don't waste your time with the sticky tabs on the cloth, it constantly will fall off. Just take finish nails to it. Only real complaint is the wheels. On a carpet causes unit to feel wobbly and you can not take them off or unit sits slanted due to bottom of unit has decorative front at bottom (non removable). But you don't usually move it once your setup, so it is somewhat petty. Unit is very nice looking."
3,Mixed Opinion,"The cabinet itself is nice, and certainly fulfills its function, but I feel it's over-engineered in terms of how it's made to go together. Be careful with assembly, as the design incorporates a series of pegs and plastic locking cams, and if you don't line everything up correctly you risk breaking the particle board. You don't need to be a rocket scientist to put the thing together, the number of bells and whistles were inadequately explained by an instruction manual that was done completely with pictures. I would have appreciated something more than cave-paintings, and a word description or three would have made the assembly process a lot less frustrating. No complaints with the final product, however.The only major heartburn I had with the deal has to do with the packaging. The cabinet pieces were inadequately padded, allowing excessive movement in the box and resulting in a number of surface scratches. Watch out for that. Good luck!"
2,Wheel problem,"I put the unit together and I thought it was kind of flimsy but I though once the glue dried it would strengthen it up. I added to the rack my A/V receiver, amplifier, cable box, DVD player and VHS player. I got everything wired up and went to push the rack back 3 feet on a hard wood floor and both front wheels broke causing the rack to tilt forward and bend so the glass door won't close. I ordered four more wheels that cost me another $50. I don't understand why techcraft would supply the rack with such cheap casters. Bottom line I wouldn't recommend this rack and if you do purchase it then do yourself a favor and replace the wheels before you have everything wired and they break on you."
3,cabinet,"directions were difficult to follow. casters do not roll easily on carpet. does not feel sturdy but does look very nice and did the job until I tried to move it into place. As soon as I moved it, the casters broke off. I had to use a shim to get it level. I should have gone by the other reviews. I cannot recommend this product"
3,Wheels,"Order arrived on time. Easy to assemble. Put in stereo components. Moved it to the spot I wanted, got it to close to the wall. Pulled it out about 3"" and the left front of the cabinet dipped. The cabinet is sitting on short napped new carpet. Then I unloaded all the components, laid the cabinet on its side.I found one (plastic) wheel completely broken. Looking at the other three wheels, found they were all cracked. Went to my local hardware store, bought four steel wheels. Put it all back together and now it works fine. About 100 pounds empty and maybe 50 pounds of equipment. This is all sitting on all plastic wheels. Sent stronger wheels in the package and it will be worth the price. If anyone plans on buying one, I suggest you also purchase steel wheels."
1,useless tech craft SF50,"The package arrived damaged, no instructions, parts missing, and the stand itself was damaged. It is junk and it was returned."
1,Do Not Buy!!,"I recently bought this item and assembled it. Assembly is fairly easy but glass door took sometime to align properly. It looked good for sure, just like in pictures. Then I got my Home theater installed, the technician put all the equipment in the racks, as soon as we tried moving the rack back to the wall, 2 wheels broke and came off. I called amazon and they were willing to replace or refund the order, but that would mean that I would have to take all the equipment out and call the technician again to re-install everything. I asked if they could just ship me the broken part, in this case the wheels and they said its against there policy. So since I could not do that, I am stuck with a Rack which is balancing on 2 wheels."
2,Week construction,"Well below expectation. It is a good looking rack but surprisingly week. I set it up, put on the coasters and rolled it a couple of feet and one of the wheels/coasters broke. It looks like a plastic molding but just snapped, would not have expected that. I had sent a msg to the seller expecting to receive a replacement coaster but no response."
2,Techcraft SF50,"I read all the reviews and everyone was right on. The quality of materials is poor, Casters broke moving it into place the first time, Shelves broke assembling, and the little hard ware broke when twisting in place. I would not buy this again, seems stable without casters."
3,Not good buy,Delivered with missing pieces; ; scratched on top and side; very difficult to assemble. Cheap assembly materials(screws)kept stripping out had to rig door. If not assembled would return. Would not recommend for purchase.
1,The thing wobbles.,When it came I was careful to follow all the directions . When it was all together I realized the shelves were in backwards. That meant taking it apart although the dowels had already been glued. I managed to succeed anyway but the entire thing wobbles . I even braced it with L shaped pieces of metal but it still wobbles . If I had purchased this piece of trash at a store I would have put it in my car and returned it .
1,Holiday Shlock,"This is a crass attempt to cash on. Done in a so called swing style, this does not swing very much and the arrangements don't do justice to the songs and the feel of the holiday. Worst of all, the singer is mediocre at best. I played this once, and now it's a drink coaster for my Chanukah refreshments."
3,Not worth reading,There was no central plot or arch character. It was over before it even began. Not recommended for long airplane flights. The positive stars I give are are due to the excellent cover art.
4,Really cute,"I bought this keychain so that I would be able to find my keys in my purse faster, but it never made it onto my keys because my 3 year old daughter swiped it and plays with it constantly. So, I can't really rate it as a keychain, but my daughter would give it 5 stars."
2,Cute,"Amazon had me rate this item as a toy, not really a toy more just a stuffed animal small on a keychain. I have a snorkie and this looks like him, except pink. Cute item"
2,Misfire,"The Great Artist Now Departed produced perhaps 20 masterpiece albums and 20 excellent ones. This is not among them. Sappy songs of an off-day, sketchily arranged as compared with his best. Hard to follow even though knew some from elsewhere, and I will swear he did a few much better among the 40 albums of great value. Almost fell asleep, strained brain trying to follow down mud-laden pathways going nowhere musically. Apparently anything with William Tritt Piano featured--like others with this problem with these forces and label--had to be done off the normal mode of performance, perhaps for a slow-witted hayseed benefactor? Less than the sum of its parts, played with mechanical feel in off-center tempos."
3,"Ok, but not Great",These are ok but not great. Fairly light weight. Thread on one striped out when I tried to tighten set screw. Ok if you plan to install and leave in-place but would suggest something a little more robust if you plan to handle them often.
2,Candy was stale,I was somewhat disappointed by this purchase. They did not taste fresh. The bags that you purchase in the store are fresher.
2,Short for the Money,I like touched by an Angel. But they should really let people know that it is only 4 episodes on the disc. And most of the episodes were older ones. And it was inspirational but If I would have known there were only going to 4 episodes I would have bought one of the earlier season DVD's for almost the same price and added 5 or 10 dollars.
1,Why I Too Am Not Buying This Set......,"Hear this people at Paramount Studios and Anyone Else Responsible For Getting the Touched By An Angel series out on DVD.......you've been dragging your feet, causing us all to wait impatientlysince the show ended!! Come on people?! SEVEN YEARS of waiting to have my favorite episodes is driving me to seriously consider buying from one of the many booters out there on the internet!And your response to fans like us demanding you get on the ball, by putting out episodes we may already have feels like a slap on the face. Come on guys! Get A move on will ya?"
2,Unscientific,"Seeing how this book was written around 1974, most of its ""mysteries"" have probably now been solved. Here's a tip: don't waste your time on this book."
2,Intro to Farm Toy Collecting,"This book was a disappointment. This gives the reader a intro to farm toy collecting. It is not a resource book. The the average farm toy collector, there is not any new information in this book. It is for the beginner."
5,Solid,"What can one say about a fixed router base? It fits the router, which easily slides in and out, and is solid. Handles are comfortable. No problems."
1,not happy,"cover print looks very faded and pixelated, like an obvious bootleg. no menu,no language settings, no bonus, spanish audio only ( the inside cover says bonus features and original portuguese audio). very disappointed."
4,A absolutely beautiful assimilation of music,"Somebody notify the Grammy people, because these artists are on their way and they are se-ri-ous. Beautiful CD!!"
1,WAY over priced. WALMART get twice as many for LESS of same product.,ran into walmart on the way home after I order this (Walmart is next door). THey sell the exact boards for $4.00 for 5. These are $11.00 for 6. Walmart sells a 10 pk for less. Just a lil tip!
5,Wonderful Cake Board,"Perfect for large sized and unique shaped cake projects (i.e. long & wide oval shaped cakes, long rectangular cakes, or tiered heart shaped cakes, etc.). Cake board is nice and sturdy, so can handle a heavy cake. If you're using it for layered, therefore heavier cakes then just double boards up & put tape on the sides of board for a more heavy duty performance. I am happy with this product and I recommend it."
5,cake boards,glad I ordered them it's easier than running to the supply store every time I need a board just the right size for most of the cake pans I have
3,Wilton Cake Boards,"I feel, in hind site, that with the shipping cost, that I could have purchased this item at the store for cheaper."
2,Is this the same author?!?,"This book could have been summarized in about 50 pages. Wow. NOTHING HAPPENED. i kept waiting and waiting. I skimmed practically the whole book. I was very, very dissapointed. To go from one of the best books I've read in a long time (the previous book) to this was such a let down. I miss Elena. I miss Clay and Jeremy. I miss the humor, action, the people from the last books. It's as if the last book was written by a totally different author. The author of this book is someone I would never read again. I will try the next book only because I loved the first two. I miss the creativity. I really felt Kelley was trying something new. Good for her for trying. BUT, it flopped big time. On top of it, the plot was terrible and Paige was weak and soooo annoying. I tried, but I could not ever like her. Also, Cortez? What? Uh. Ok. Not a believable character at all. Enough said. It sucked big time."
3,Not what I expected,"I picked up this book based on the 4-5 star reviews it got. I have to say that it was really difficult for me to get into the story line. I like Paige (and the other characters) well enough but I had a hard time ""getting into the book"". I felt sometimes that the story dragged and had to make a real effort to finish it, because I don't like not finishing a book.For me, it was just OK."
2,The Coven was right,"Luckily, I read ""Industrial Magic"" before I read ""Dime Store Magic"", so I know that Paige Winterbourne doesn't remain the immature, brain-dead dweeb she is in ""Dime Store.""The Coven didn't think Paige was mature enough to be Savannah's guardian and I have to agree with them. Savannah outshines Paige in both survival skills and decision-making abilities. Maybe she should be Paige's guardian.This review based on only the first half of the book - when I finally became so frustrated with Paige's childish behavior, I tore up the book and threw it in the garbage - only the second book in over 40 years that I've deliberately thrown away."
1,Completely upset,"I love to read books however I also listen to them instead of the radio on the way to and from work...so image my frustration when I tried to listen to the third book and it was disabled. WOW what a disappointment. So instead continuing with a series that I have started to love, I will find something else. And I know for some this is not a big deal for some, but it is for me."
5,"WOW, I love this book ....","I just can't put it more strongly than that: I love this book. LOVE. It's got everything -- fascinating characters, a rich plot, great worldbuilding ... I'm flat-out blown away.Paige is an absolutely wonderful character -- warm, real, smart, sexy, grounded in reality but rich in fantasy terms as well. The world-within-a-world of the supernaturals is enticing and wonderfully drawn. And Lucas Cortez -- he's such a wonderful character -- defying both the conventions within the book, and in the genre itself at every turn.Thank you, Ms. Armstrong, for this wonderful book. Now pardon me while I run and buy EVERYTHING Kelley's ever written ..."
3,Front cover,"This is a book, so I know there's not much to review in way of content because you can look that up yourself in book reviews but the book was in good condition when I got it. The biggest grievance I have is that that yellow circle on the cover with a price. I gave this book as a gift and because it had a yellow price ON the cover I had to cover it with Sharpie. Just know that before you buy the book."
2,"It was alright, I guess......","I agree with some of the other reviewers that it was hard to care about the characters because of a lack of, um, character. Maybe it was because I didn't read the earlier novels, but then I didn't have that problem with Terry Goodkind or Kate Forsyth. It was one of two books I've put down 3/4 of the way through in favor of another, though this one I did pick back up and finish. My opinion of the book improved towards the end, though the sex scenes felt like an afterthought to me, even compared to the reluctant lovers in Kristin Landon's ""Hidden Worlds."" And halfway through the second chapter I could tell without reading the bio that the writer wasn't from Massachusetts. Even the street names didn't feel ""New England."" Oh well, I did read the whole thing, but I won't be reading another by this author."
2,Dime Store Magic,"If you want to read a book about a woman with no back bone you might want to read this book. Paige the main charactor of this book might as well be your next door neighbor, she's boring and meelee mouthed. I've read Armstong's other books (bitten and stolen) and I've enjoyed them. But I've notice she like her female charactor to have little or no control over the event in their lives. In DSM I felt like throwing this book across the room when ever Paige had a confrontation with anyone in her life. She always back down and did thing their way. Also explain to me the reasoning behind keeping Savannah in the dark about her own life. May be it would be better for her to live with her sorcerer father so she doesn't turn out to be a wimp like Paige. If you like you female leads to be strong women (Anita blake) don't read this book."
3,A different turn from the first two...,"I had some initial trepidation about this third installment in Armstrong's Women of the Otherworld series after reading the synopsis on the back cover. The focus shifted from Elena and the werewolves to a new storyline, and a new main character here, Paige, a witch. Werewolves appeal more to me than witches, but I liked Armstrong's clear, and exciting style, so I hoped that this, too, would be an entertaining novel. And, for the most part, it was fun to read - but not as much fun as the first two books in the series. One thing that really started to bother me was how many times the title phrase appeared in the text. It was so distracting! I plan on seeing where the series goes, but I hope that the direction shifts back to the werewolves!"
3,Could be better...,"The problem with this novel didn't really hit me 'til I was about halfway through with it. It was then that I realized that I just didn't care what happened to any of these characters. I know earlier reviewers have said that this book stands alone - well, I haven't read any of Kelley Armstrong's previous novels so maybe that's why I felt no real connection with the characters. Maybe it's also because the characters never really seemed to be in any real danger. I mean, the whole story revolves around a custody battle. The only real conflict, most of the time, is between Paige and the curious onlookers that camp out on her front lawn. I got through the book due to Armstrong's easy-to-read writing. She's a very good author but I would prefer a little more danger and excitement. Unfortunately, during the last half of the book, I was just to the point where I really didn't care what the outcome was."
4,Great book in a good series,"Need to read all the other books to get the full picture, but great book in a very readable series from an entertaining author"
1,I did not like Paige Winterbourne,"Paige Winterbourne stumbles her way through this book, assailed on all sides by people who hate her for no good reason. (Most of them, the reader suspects, hate her because she's rude to them. Paige claims repeatedly that she wants to help people, but she Does Have Her Pride, and she Does Not Hesitate To Tell People Off.) The sole exception is Lucas, who remains polite and helpful despite Paige's insults and abuse, until about two-thirds of the way through the book, when she relents and they have sex.Is this how a heroine is supposed to see the world?"
3,It was fine...,"Okay, I admit that this wasn't the best book I've ever read. It got off to a slow start and yes, the main character was a bit annoying. But, she was realistic and well-fleshed. Her actions were well explained (sometimes ad nauseum) as was her inaction.That said, the second half of the book was MUCH better. Armstrong has hooked me into the lives of the characters and now I can't wait until the next book comes out so I can find out what happens. Her writing style is a bit more serious than I'm accustomed to, but her world is fully realised and easy to believe."
1,"Sucked, big time","I always read the reviews before buying authors I am not familiar with. I bought the first two books in this series even though there were people who had problems with it. Most of the reviews seemed positive. I ended up liking both books a lot. The characters were interesting, the plot lines involving and the writing good.I got to this one, and....it was awful. She had switched characters but that was no excuse for making the characters uninteresting and one dimensional. She'd introduce a character that seemed mildly interesting and then just make them do strange things. The villain, a half demon woman, especially seemed to do strange things. I found the idea of the cabals interesting, but not enough to make up a total lack of interesting plot. After two good books, I wonder what went wrong with this one?So I'm not sure about subsequent books. Do I take a chance or not? And I obviously can't trust the reviews any more since this book had very positive ones."
2,Mediocre Book,"I love Kelley Armstrong's werewolf books. Bitten and Stolen really captured me to the point where I read them both in one sitting. Dimestore Magic was not one of those reads. The heroine, Paige, was REALLY annoying. She doesn't have a backbone or any commen sense. She really lacks the edge and strength that Elena (heroine from Bitten and Stolen) has in abundance. The other characters didn't really impress me that much either. That being said, the book is not terrible. It is just not up to par with Kelley Armstrong's other books. If you haven't read her other books I recommend starting with them."
1,"Boring, boring, boring.","This is my first time read from this author. I kept waiting for the adult version to come through. I think this is more on the scale of a teen witch novel. I am use to reading books by Kim Harrison, Carrie Vaughn, Patricia Briggs, Kim Harrison. Sorry guys, but this is the first and last of her for me! Dime Store Magic, exactly."
5,The Best of 2.13.61 publications,"This book contains a great array of mixed emotions,feelings and thoughts. It contains extracts from the various authors at Henry Rollins' publishing company, 2.13.61. It not only contains some great writing by the big man himself, it also contains the other great talents which grace the 2.13.61 Publishing company. These artists include, The great Hubert Shelby, JNR. Jefferey Lee Pierce, Ian Shoales, Bill Shields, Iggy Pop, Henry Miller, Don Bajema, the late Joe Cole and ""Suicides"" frontman Alan Vega, plus many more. This is a great book for anyone wanting a ""sneek peak"" at some of the greatest writing that we may see in this day and age. These guys are raw and intense. This book is intense. It may also hopefully put you onto some great authors you have never heard of, Enjoy."
2,Workmanship leaves much to be desired,"The first time I tried this oven the heating elements would not get hot enough so I sent it back (it cost me 14.95 to have Haier send me another one). I just tried the new one and the door does not shut properly.To make a long story short, I wish I had never ordered this brand oven."
2,More problems than pluses,"I bought one and the plate that diffused the air was off center so it baked unevenly. I called and was told it was a defect and would do a warranty exchange. I was under the impression they would send it out but when I called, I was told I was supposed to send in $14.95 for shipping or I could give them a charge card and they would charge it again to ship out a new one and credit when I returned it. The new unit I received has had problems with the digital timer displaying the timer but rather than to have a short so rat her than do the return thing again I just used a manual timer. It baked a bit more evenly and was fast but still needed to rotate pans. I just recently had a power spike that took out all electronics plugged in, including the oven but I doubt I will reorder this product. Too unpredictible."
3,Haier RTC1700SS,This oven works well but has only single pane glass in door also it has very little insulation and the eletronics and dial seem much to cheap for this product I think I would try the costco product next time still I like the oven
1,Still Waiting,I bought a Haier RTC1700SS oven from Amazon about a month ago. I am still waiting for a replacement from Haier because the trays & spit did not fit.I hope by this summer I will know what it's like to cook on a con- vection oven. I'll let you know if I ever get a chance to use the one I've already paid for.
1,history?,I bought this for my Social Studies methods class and we never used it at all. I have never even read it. It is still brand new.
4,Good Inverter,Works as described on most products. I bought it to charge cordless drill batteries on jobsites. 4 stars because it drains the vehicle battery dry in several minutes unless the vehicle is running. . Had to get the van jumped off the first time I used it after only 5 minutes of using it for battery charging.
3,Not right!,"While I don't agree with the other reviewer about the sound quality, I find this recording to be very un-French. It is heavy and ponderously emphatic where it should be lighter and more sprightly. It isn't a matter of speed. The worst problem with this CD, however, is that Mr. Kunzel chose to insert the Barcarolle earlier than it should be, making the ballet end with the Can-Can rather than the beautiful and nostalgic Barcarolle. Manuel Rosenthal, the arranger, knew better."
2,cheap is what you asked for,"for the amount of money spent, its prbably worth it. but thats assuming you dont care about sound quality, i made the mistake of buying it, but it was cheap and gt the job done. just not as i wanted it to."
2,Stopped Working,"So everything was going well... I could listen to my music in my car...THEN it just stopped working. Just like that... i was very annoyed. I just went to APPle Store and got a ""real"" one. You get what you pay for I suppose."
5,Good product,I bought a new car recently and I needed a jack to go from my ipod nano into the stereo. This works perfectly.
4,Cheap and it works,"This cable makes it really easy to get good quality sound out of your iPod. The cable itself is very flexible, however this may be it's downfall, it lasted just under a year before it died completely. For less than $15 it really doesn't matter, it's cheap enough to just replace each year."
4,Works great with my car stereo,"I bought this cable so I could get the appropriate levels out of my iPod on my Pioneer car stereo. Connecting the iPod to the stereo via the headphone jack just resulted in music that was way too quiet to hear. This cable solved the problem in an instant. The connector to the iPod itself feels fairly robust to me. My only gripe is that at 4 feet, it seems a little long. However, I'd rather the cable be too long than too short, so it's minor problem at best."
1,Does not work with iPod Touch 2nd gen...,I thought it would but no luck does not work at all with my new itouch. So do not buy if you are using a 2nd gen itouch as it will not work.
5,Works great!,"I was looking for a way to make my iPod play through a boombox or speakers. This worked perfectly. Just connect the dock to your iPod and the other end to a ""line in"" on whatever you want the sound to come out of, and it works great. Sound quality is as good as you will get with a stereo plug."
3,Doesn't work with 5th-Gen Nano,I've used this cord successfully with an old Ipod but the battery was losing charge so I bought a new Nano to replace it. Lo and behold I plug in the Nano and no sound comes out of my car's speakers. Guess the Nano isn't compatible.
4,Ok cables,These plug in great and are compatible with my car... However I expected them to also charge my Ipod and they do not. I made the wrong assumption that because it has a bottom plug instead of using the headphone jack it would charge. Oh well.
5,Sounds Great!,This cable does exactly what it is supposed to do. It connects my iPod/iPhone to my car stereo through the aux jack and connects to the doc connector on the bottom of my device. It is easy to use and seems well made enough that after about 6 months of use I haven't had any visual signs of wear yet. It's nice to have uniform sound from the dock connector instead of having to mess with the volume on my device if I used the headphone jack. I would recommend this.As others have stated since you are using the dock connector you can't charge your device at the same time. I'll admit that's a little inconvenient but I knew that before I bought it so I'm not going to take anything away from the cable for it. It does what it's supposed to and does it perfectly. Besides I can play music for a very long time without worrying about needing to charge anyway.
5,Ditch the Headphone Jack,I couldn't be happier with this product. If you are looking for an improvement in audio quality from your ipod / iphone and your vehicle only has a 3.5mm aux audio input this is the cable for you.The sound quality is makedly improved. Richer sounds across the board.Item shipped quickly and was exactly as described.I will be ordering another for my wife's car.
4,Great solution to technical difficuties,"I bought this cable because the headphone Jack on my iPod broke. I didn't want to take it to a repairman who may not know what to do, and I didn't want to replace it so soon. So I looked for any cheap alternative, and I came across this. I saw iPod dock connector to 3.5mm jack, and I thought that I could do something with that. So I run the 3.5mm jack into a female-to-female into headphones, and it works perfectly. The only downside is that it doesn't respond to the volume on your iPod, but a necessary sacrifice, and the preset volume is perfect. Not to loud and not to soft. Perfect."
1,Does not work with iPhone 3Gs,"Hooking up AV stuff and making it work is something I do for fun and I could not get the iPhone 3Gs to play through the car stereo with this cable. I set the car stereo to Aux input jack, plugged one end into the car and the other into the phone and the sound still came out of the phone speaker no matter what I did with the settings. If someone can tell me what to do to get it to work I'll buy it again but for now I'm returning it."
1,WARNING - Not compatible with Ipod Touch,"Warning - this cable does not work with Ipod Touch. It looks like Apple changed the pin-out sequence of their dock connector for the latest generation of i-touch (this I figured out after much searching of the internet). OK, so this may be an issue created by Apple, but nowhere is the incompatibility acknowledged on the Amazon site or even on the product packaging.Hope this helps someone else avoid the several hours of frustration that I went through figuring this out..."
3,"Good cable, but not for Iphone","I bought this cable thinking it would work for all ipods / iphones... after all it is just line out, not charging. Well it turns out this cable does not work for iphone, and from what I read, ipod touch as well. This must be just an old gen cable."
1,Din not work with Nano 5th generation,I connected this between my clock radio and my Nano 5th generation. The Nano continued to use it's internal speaker. Did not recognize a cable was connected.
1,Useless,I used this cable once. I got great sound but a few hours of play my ipod went dead. I tried resetting but nothing. I hooked it up to the computer and got the message that my batter was extremely low. I then checked a few reviews and learnt that ipods' hard drives get fried using this cable. So I guess I have squandered some dough.
3,Is not 4 feet...,I haven't tried this cord out yet. Seems to be of high quality. But it is NOT 4 feet like it says. It is 6 feet. I bought a shorter cord for a reason. Disappointed.
2,Great until it stops working,"I have now had two of these and both have broken within a year of use. By broken I mean stops transmitting sound to half the speakers in the car. Both of these that I have owned stopped sending to the passenger side of the car. Tried it in different cars, adjusting the fade and the balance and nope it stops sending to the passenger side. I like the cable better than the standard headphone jacks but after this second one I am not buying another one. Save your money and buy a cheapo headphone jack style cable."
1,Not pleased.,This product did not work for my ipod (2nd gen ipod touch) and the seller refused to give me a refund. I was very disappointed at the customer service of this company.
4,Great Product,"Works great. Delivers much better sound quality that connectors that go through the headphone jack, as well as allows better handling of ipod while browsing or making selections."
4,Works OK,"Used with my car audio system, a bit of distortion, I believed there may be a mismatch in line voltage between the doc connector output and stereo input."
4,Does the trick,"I use this cable to connect my iPod to the line-in on my work PC. It works perfectly for this purpose, sounds great and is much cheaper than getting a dock and the necessary cables!"
4,Aux Cable,"I bought this hoping that I could use this on the radio as well as my car, but I realized that my radio does not have an auxiliary hole, only a headphone hole. So I only got half of what I wanted. When I play it in the car, I can adjust the volume pretty well. I'm not sure, but I noticed the volume going up when the car is driving fast, but when the car slows down, the volume lowers. I'm not sure if it was my car or the cable. But it has been useful, I rarely used it though. I have had this for about 2 weeks. Also, the deliver was quite quick and came in about 3 days."
1,BEWARE... don't review this until you've tried it for a while.,"Initially when I got this product it worked, well enough for me not considering returning. Now I have the twist the cable around in order to make it work."
5,Stops the Hum and Hiss!!!,"Bottom line: This will send line level sound to any AUX input port. I bought this because I needed an inexpensive was to connect my 6th Gen iPod to my car stereo, which had a compatible AUX input port. My previous attemp involved running a direct male-male cable from the iPods headphone jack to the car's AUX port. That worked but produced a noticeable warbling hiss, which gradually drove me NUTS. This cable, which connects to the wide iPod dock port, eliminated the hiss problem. Furthermore, this cable is long enough to place my iPod wherever I want it within my car. Finally, the cable itself is sturdy, heavyweight rubber. Worth it!"
1,No video on 3rd Gen.,I cannot get this cable to show video with my 3rd gen. nano. Sound out of it is great. I have tried all the suggestions I could find and none of them work for video. This is not the cable you need for images with the nano.
1,"Unless you're totally inept, don't bother.","I thought I'd be able to find some sophisticated ways to get revenge on the internet--mail bombing, sending pages to thousands of people with my target's phone number, et cetera. Better still, I thought, maybe I'd learn some low-level cracking stuff: the kind of stuff you could use to wreak some serious havoc.Alas, this is revenge for the very, very simple-minded only. Come on, now--who needs a book to tell them that superglue anywhere in someone's CPU will be irritating? Yes, the ideas presented in this book are just that lame. There are a few gems, but don't bother buying this book to mine them from."
1,Poor Critique,"Dawes starts with the conclusion he wants to prove, and then selects only studies which agree with it. We call this begging the question, or affirming the consequent. He ignores myriad studies, including those conducted by NIMH, which prove that Cognitive Therapy IS effective. Dr. Aaron Beck and Dr. Albert Ellis have pioneered new forms of therapy. To dismiss them out-of-hand is short-sighted."
2,house of cards,"I cannot help comparing it with the British version, which was excellent. This does not come anywhere near that version"
4,"Nice, what you'd expect and not much more.",I love his voice and enjoy his work. This CD seems to be quite similar to his other works and not different enough for me to feel It was worth adding to my collection.
5,Fantastic DVD Concert,"If you like Andrea Bocelli, you'll love this set. The DVD is a great way to spend time with a loved one. The mix of english, spanish and italian tunes makes for a very enjoyable concert. Highly recommended."
5,Romantic music,I bought this for my husband and he absolutley loves it! Great to play while driving around with your sunroof open. Who wouldn't love this mans voice?!
5,Andrea Bocelli Under the Desert Sky,I love this DVD. I think it is one of Bocelli's best. He sings the old and new standards so beautifully. I've been giving this DVD to everyone I know who loves good music. It is one of the most romantic DVD's you'll ever listen to and view.
4,A voice for today,Bocelli sings his heart out at Lake Las Vegas; must have been an evening to remember for all those attending!
5,A must for all andrea bocelli fans,The DVD is fantastic - I had watched the programme on TV before buying the DVD so knew what to expect. I was not disappointed - the music and the settings are fabulous - the DVD was well worth buying and it's something that I will watch over and over again. The CD that accompanies the DVD is also very good. All in all - an excellent CD/DVD package and would recommend this to anyone
2,Andrea Bocelli: Under the Desert Sky,Disappointed as to how few of the songs are on the CD as compared to the total DVD.
2,Andrea Bocelli CD purchase,"This was a 2 CD package. The first CD was fine but the 2nd CD didn't have any songs on the CD. I sent this back and promtly received the replacement CD from Amazon, but the 2nd CD again didn't have any songs on the CD. At this time I haven't sent the CD back because I don't have all the original packaging and packing slip since I received it around Christmas time."
1,What a boring and shallow music selection,"No matter you are a classical or pop music fan, this CD is not for you.A friend of mine gave me this CD as Christmas gift. After listening to this CD, I have the better tolerance to the terrible music..."
3,Longing for the original,"When I first heard him sing, it was 1998 and I was moved to tears. Since then it feels like someone got hold of his career and packaged him up for the biggest mass market possible - pop music that barely displays his range and depth. It sounds like he's phoning it in ... Elvis Presley redux? I hope I'm wrong, and that this is what Mr. Bocelli has chosen for himself and if that's the case then more power to him."
1,Gosh is this lame,"Such a talented singer of opera standards...I just could not imagine anything so bland, so uninspired.And I admit to be a little hooked by this ""under the desert sky"" business. I expected a star-spangled sky. What we get is a hoaky Vegas setting. If you have ever seen any of the DVDs from some of the great outdoor venues in Europe, you will find nothing whatsoever to admire in this setting.And there is zero electricity from the audience. But who could blame them."
1,WHAT A DISAPPOINTMENT Don't waste your money!,"The other reviewers have it right - the marvelous talent of Andrea Bocelli is being ruined by his handlers. This CD is boring, boring, boring. For some reason, Bocelli in English is just not as compelling....he sounds like a high-school kid reciting phoenetically from a cheat-sheet.And Catherine McPhee? Give me a break! If I want to listen to the over-marketed screaming of a talent-show runner-up, I'd tune in to the lowbrow American Idol. When I buy Bocelli, I expect to hear Bocelli. If he insists on a duet, at least choose someone of his caliber.I'm glad this was a gift, so I didn't waste any money on it. I'll be ""re-gifting"" it. Andrea, you've disappointed legions of fans."
2,boring tenor turned pop singer,"almost every song he sang sounded the same. deadbeat, robotic and boring. just like a high school student memorized a whole textbook and recited it carefully with eyes closed. no passion, no depth, no feeling at all.it's not about how high you can reach, you need different feelings and emotions to interpret, convey, extend, relay and distinguish the meanings of every song, not just by memorizing and singing them out carefully with no passion, no emotion, no nothing.i've studied every one of bocelli's arias and his pop songs but simply failed to be moved or touched in the least way. all of his stuff are just skin-deep with a 2 bits face value."
5,Love it!,This is one of my favorite DVD's . It was filmed in Vegas and the songs are fantastic. I'm not a fan of opera so this is just up my alley.
4,Some may not like it,I loved this DVD but although my husband loves Andrea he did not like this concert. He thought Andrea was being exploited. Maybe he was but must have wanted to be. A good selection from his many albums would have gone down better for an actual Crossover Album. Thought myself he had Crossed-over some years ago.Will always remain a fan.
2,Interesting,"While the stories are interesting and chock full of facts, it is poorly written. There's tons of people who are mentioned, and if you don't already know the story, you'd be lost because he doesn't explain who the people are."
3,Crazy People in the world,Did not know how many crazy people their were in positions of leadership from the beginning of time to the present.
1,Warning!,"If you read any of the authors other books, he tends to repeat much of the same material.I also wonder if the author isn't a history buff cuz some of those chapters focus more on politics and war than the true crimes of the subject. I thought those sections were best left out. I didnt want a history lesson."
1,Too much sugar,"I ordered this hoping for a stereo version of classic big band hits. It is stereo, but it's that and a lot more. Big bands did not include a string section, for one thing. The extra orchestration ruined the music. It's guilding the lilly.If you want to hear great big band music recorded by one of the masters and his peers in stereo, buy The Benny Goodman Story.This over-produced schmaltz is a bomb."
4,Performs as promised,Purchased unit to turn the heat on in our cottage in northern Wisconsin as we are driving up there. The unit works as promised. However there should be some instructions with the unit to give you an idea how to hook it up. There are none. Our existing thermostat is a simple 2 wire unit and so I connected 2 new wires to the existing connections and ran the wires to the ct241. It sounds simple and it is. I just wish they would include that in the instructions.The other observation I have is that you need to turn the ct241 off when you get there and then use your regular thermostat. Otherwise your heater will continue to run and will NOT turn off.
4,great for vacation property,"Great way to kick on the heat when you are headed to your vacation home, warm and toasty when you arrive."
3,Trouble with answering machine,Without an answering machine this product works exactly as described. I am still waiting to hear from Tech support as i have not been able to make it work with an answering machine on the telephone line as well.
3,Butt-kicking in Middle-Earth digitally.,"This game is perhaps a fun though a completely different way of showing the RotK events which proves to be a major negative.Pretty much, the game is exciting from the beginning (Helms Deep finale) to the Cracks of Doom (Gollum turns nasty there), you fight and kill orcs, spiders, etc. Also certain characters will have special powers which can cause lots of chaos.Though you may need a fair computer to run RotK, you should also pick up an extreme to run this one."
2,"Good graphics, poor menus and instructions","Do you want to save your game sometimes? If so, you will have to finish an entire level. I thought I would never get that far. (Yes, I have spent a great deal of time playing games that are this difficult, but better designed). After you get the the 2nd level, what if you want to start a new game? The only way I could do it was to go to the Windows Task Manager and kill the process. After that, I had to restart the game and watch the video intro again. I know they are proud of the graphics (yes, I liked the movie), but...."
5,The second best game in the world,This is one fun game! I could play it for 9 hours. The graphics are good. I think that the levels are cool.One problem is that some of the stuff didn't happen.I wish the orc bodies didn't dissapear.It would make it look more like real life.
2,Don't waste your money!,"Buy this game if you are looking to buy a new video card anyway and you enjoy continual frustration. It did take a while to get the hang of the commands, and the route with Frodo and Gandalf are alright, but I have tried and failed to defeat the King of the Dead so many times that I finally just quit. I play these games to relax and this just doesn't do it for me."
1,I cand belibe it,"Dis is stupid. mi computer is not good enough to run this video. they did not say I would need a cd-whatever drive. All i have is a floppy drive. other then not having the cd, my computer is really high tech. My cousin said it is the newest technology. It has 23 mb of harddrive. and 16 mb of ramm. I can't believe it. Do not buy if even the newest and best computer can not play it."
3,Great graphics and storyline - Too difficult,"After playing this game for a few days I can say it looks great, blends great with cut-scenes from the movie itself, but is simply TOO DIFFICULT for a casual gamer.I had to repeat one level over 20 times to finish it, and I'm still stuck on some of them even after repeating them dozens of times."
3,Not so good 4 a LOTR game,This game has its good and bad points...GOOD-Very good and clear graphics-Has co-op modeBAD-Frustratingly DIFFICULT!-Extremely LONG cutscenes!-Lousy camera angles!I expected this could be better than The Two Towers but it stayed as lousy as that EXCEPT that Return of the King is far more difficult.I'm WARNING U...THINK TWICE B4 BUYING THIS GAME!
1,Be careful!,Very disappointing! If you buy this game make sure you read other reviews and go to the official website first! No where on the box description of requirements does it state that you need one of two specific video cards in your computer! It does say you need a 3D card with 32 MB - But it should also say on the box that you need one of two specific chipsets for your video card! It did not say that on the box I bought! Now I have a game that I cannot play! Trust me if you do not have a NVIDIA GeForce2 GTS or greater or ATI Radeon 7500 or greater chipset - it will not play! I have tried everything! In Amazon's requirements it does mention it but I did not come here first! I will next time!
3,Fun to a point,"The biggest problem with this game is the saving mode. There's no way to name your own saves, and when it does, it's deceiving because it names the slot after one of three ""paths"" that you played last even though it actually saves all of them. Plus, while there are ""checkpoints"" within the levels that allow you to start over in that place if you die, the only way you can save your progress is by beating an entire level. That means you have to devote yourself to a couple of hours of playing time if you want to make any headway whatsoever.The beginning levels are fun, but they get frustratingly long and tedious. I think the developers stuck too close to the plot of the movie, and created a game that just goes on and on.Graphics are great, and the sound is excellent, but this only rates average on playability."
4,this is a great game,this games is cool a lot of say this game is no good because the levels are to hard that is because they have a ps2 or a consal and you can get cheat codes with the consal and there hard to find on pc the levels are chaleging but fun this game has very good graphis so if you want a chaleging game and you like lord or the rings this is the game for you
1,REQUIRES 32MB AGP Graphics Card!,"I know others have mentioned it, but I spent about an hour before leaving work looking for system requirements. They weren't listed on the official site, Amazon, and any other major electronics retail outlets sites. So I figured my recently purchased laptop would be sufficient. Shelled out my bucks, got the game, started loading it and saw the Video Card requirements. Nothing in the install mentioned it or tested for it. The install took 45+ min (2 discs!). Only when you try to start the game does it check your video card and fail. Wouldn't even start! So I can't review it. I can't even play it!I've played the Two Towers game on Playstation2 and this was supposed to be better. I was hoping to play it on my PC, but I guess I'll wait. (Sigh!)"
5,The second best game in the world,"This is one fun game. The graphics are good,and the combos cool.I could play 9 hours of this.The only probelem is that some stuff actuelly didn't happen. I like Aregorn the best. But I wish the orc bodies wouldn't dissapear."
1,This Game Sucks.,"I played the game for the PC. I disliked it. It was really repetitive and boring. I wasn't having fun at all. I decided to uninstall it. It deleted everything in the folder in which it was installed. This included 3 GB of valuable files that had taken me a long time to acquire. Not only did the game suck, but the uninstall program sucked even more! I know that's hard to believe, but believe me. Don't get this game, but if its too late for that, don't install it because if you ever take the program down, it will bring others along. If its installed already, you're stuck with it forever, unless you want to lose valuable programs as well. Nice going EA Games."
1,waste of money.... stupid EA games,"Spent 40 dollars on this game. Get it home, wait a HALF AN HOUR for it to install itself... only to get an error message. Even though on the back of the box, it said you should have a 32 MB graphics card, which I have, it turns out my card isn't good enough, and the jerks at EA games want me to shell out a hundred bucks for a new one. Would have been nice if they warned me BEFORE I spent all the time and money on it. To be fair, there were some types of cards listed below the 32 meg requirement, but I figured they were just examples, and the 32 meg was what mattered. STUPID EA GAMES! DO NOT WASTE YOUR TIME AND MONEY ON THIS GARBAGE! EVEN IF YOU THINK YOU HAVE A PRETTY DESCENT COMPUTER, THERE IS A GOOD POSSABILITY THIS TRASH WON'T WORK! thank you."
1,Couldn't even play the game,"This game seems really cool, but unfortunately my video card is not up to date. I just bought a brand new computer last year with the latest technology, but apparently it's not advanced enough for this game.Make sure you have the system requirements before buying this game!!!"
5,How awesome is this?,This game simply amazed me. The cinematography had me in awe. I simply connot express how much I love this game!
5,WhoaaaaH!,"OK, I lose interest in pretty much every game in about 2 -5 days. But ROTK - well, I keep inviting my friend on weekend nights to come over so that we can kill Orcses and such together, and be aragorn and legolas for a couple of hours. If I was to buy but one game, it would be this one. So - go, buy, enjoy, and get obsessed by it! It is SO worth it (excuse my Americanisms!)!"
4,Better than expected,"Just got it today. After seeing a couple negative reviews up here while my order was in transit I was a bit worried about my purchase, but having played it a bit, I have no regrets whatsover. Basically the does a good job mixing the movie elements in with hack-and-slash arcade-like gameplay and the result is a very solid action game that blends in well with the theme. I suppose you can get the console versions instead (and save a couple GBs of drive space), but if you don't own one (like me) and yearn for the occasional action game then get this! I don't know about standard PC controls, but with two USB gamepads hooked up to my system it plays great in co-op! The only complaint I have is lack of netplay, which could have had potential in a game like this, but that's the only reason I'd knock of the 5th star."
1,Can't even play it yet,"This game needs you to buy a 154 dollar video PC cards to play it. No wonder it's a bit cheaper than Halo for PC. They expect you to have a PC graphic card. I can't even play it. If somehow I can play it, I will rate it again to see how it is really."
5,this is awesome,"Buy it. Now. I don't care what the other people say. Ima showem, Ima showem. No one crisp as me. I'm a game ninja. I completed it in oh, say, 2 hours. Quite easy. I seriously reccomend this game to anyone with an IQ above 27."
5,Great Disney classics,"Simply stated, if you enjoy Disney tunes, you'll love this CD. There are tracks offered on this release that have been extremely hard to get on any other disc -- even from Disney themselves. And even though these aren't the exact arrangements as the original Disney tunes, they are expertly done by the Pops. There are some great pieces to sing along with or if your lips feel like puckering out a whistle -- go for it -- it's great stuff!"
1,Do not buy this product,"The game version does not match the one played online and online is the only way to play this game. The patches to make it the version played online are not compatable with this version of the game. Prima makes no attemt to support this product. The manual is nothing more that the text for the game. I would like my money back. I had to down load the game to make it work. This a free game, it is put out by the US Army and is free to download. the game is fun and the army tech support in the best I have seen. But that has nothing to do with this version of the game."
1,20 bucks?,20 bucks for a guide of a game that tax payers paid for? in October the console release of Americans Army is coming out and that's 50 bucks right there. All tax payer money. With the cost of that our troops could have more armor
2,you get what you pay for...,"wanted to get a VT watch for a friend and needed it to be big/bold, so i liked this one right away. i couldn't believe how expensive some of the VT watches were and was afraid of getting ripped off. This watch was under $30 and it shows. The band is super-cheap looking (plastic or rubber? not what an adult would choose) but the rest of the watch is ok (it is big and bold). i should have spent more and gotten a better looking/higher quality watch."
2,"Cute, but not great","I agree with the other reviewer that gave it two stars. I found Amelia to be annoying and I didn't like that everyone acted like she was something special. Her character seemed shallow and immature. Also, I didn't think what Jesse did was so bad. Amelia Didn't give him enough credit when she found out there was more to him.it is an entertaining book, but Samantha and the Cowboy was better."
3,Not so great,"The plot of this book didn't ""wow"" me. Personally I would try: Tess and the Highlander, Emily and the Scot, Belle and the Beau, or Victoria and the Rogue. Still not a bad book but not the best out of the Avon True Romance series for teens."
4,Fun,"This is a fun game for the most part. Great graphics, and ya know that little Nintendo-Mario-twist on soccer is great. But, it gets really, really hard, sometimes throw-your-controller-at-the-TV-hard. But, other than that, it's a good game! (Don't lose your temper!) -Trent Foreman, Author of Nightmare"
2,Mario gets Striked,"So far since I've been playing this game (Super Mario Strikers), it makes no sense. Get points and win the game. Very detailed huh?In my honest opinion, I would rate this game 2 stars. Plus, the animations suck!Sincerly,A Mario Fan (peace out :P)"
5,Very fun,"I usually hate sports games. Yet, after playing this in the store for 5 minutes, I was addicted. Like any good addict, I took out my wallet without a second thought and bought it. I have not been disappointed.This is a sports game, with tournaments and strategy. Yet, unlike traditional sports games, this one involves brutal tackles, cool items, and fun characters. My friends, who love sports games, and I have played this incessantly for the past few days.One warning: the higher levels are very difficult. Yet, most of the cool bonus items, such as the hidden stages and characters, can be won simply by playing the easiest level. It is the best of both worlds.The only thing that would have made this game better would have been the Mexican soccer announcer yelling GOOOOOOOOOOAAAAAALLLLL every time you get a goal."
3,Nothing compared to it's own sequel!,"Super Mario Strikers is an OK game, but it's not that fun. There isn't a big enough selection of characters to put on a team, and the gameplay quickly gets repetitive and boring. Although, it's a little more fun with 2 players playing. The tournement mode will quickly get boring, and probably frustrating, because the point system doesn't work. This is the kind of game you should rent.Presentation- 73/100Graphics- 87/100Graphics look great!Sound- 48/100Mainly because there isn't much sound in the game, not that it sounds bad.Gameplay- 51/100Replay Value- 44/100Overall- 56/100"
4,Mario Kicks THE Ball,"HI EVERYONE!I love Mario games; sports, action- you name it; I love it.But it gets kinda tiring if all you do is kick and run. Don't get me wrong; I like the game! But those who don't like the same thing everytime- don't buy it.detail : B+fun : Bworth your money : yes-Sfmf"
3,BIZARRE!!!,"Okay, I've read ""Altar Ego"" and ""Foetal Attraction"" by Kathy Lette and I was expecting more of the same, but in short story format when I picked up this book. However, that was NOT what I got. Frankly, I'm not sure what I got. None of the stories remotely resembled the other two books of hers I've read. The stories range from a one-sided conversation with a washed-up soccer groupie to the diary of a teenager who runs away from home with her cat to live on a commune. The longest story in the book is the most interesting - the story of two girls and a guy living together in an abandoned house in the bad part of Sydney. (Yes, these stories take place in Australia.) I'm not sure if I can recommend this book even as a time-waster, though I did read it all the way through. (Granted, I was trapped at a convention booth with nothing to do for 8 hours.)"
5,Hand Wipes,These Purall hand wipes are great we take them every where we go. They clean and sanatize your hands.
5,Mostest best book eva!!!!!!,this was the bestest best book I ever ever read. maybe i will read it again. my favoritest was the elephants. they like to party!!!!!!!!!!! yay!!!!!!!!!!! :)
4,Flowers A to Z with Donna Dewberry,Loved all the flowers! Nice and easy instruction book.Her books give you the colors you will need so you can check your supplies and be totally ready to paint
5,Great for beginners,"Donna Dewberry's books are great for beginners, shows lots of details. Well worth the price. I have several of her books and love all of them."
5,Donna Dewberry book,"I really enjoyed this book. I borrowed it from the library first, and then decided it would be a great reference book while doing one-stroke painting."
4,Donna's Flowers A to Z,"Good solid book, but nothing really stellar. It has some good techniques, but not the Wow factor in many of the other books"
4,Not for the beginner,The book is wonderful but it will take me a long time to master even one of these flowers. I am just a beginner. A novice if you will. So for the more experienced painter this is a good book.
4,Painting Ease,"I enjoyed the instructions in this book. First, a detailed explanation of how to complete each type of stroke is given. Then, the book has detailed information on how to paint many different types of flowers and arrangements. And finally,(this is the best part) it goes on to explain how to create original arrangements depending on the surface space the painter has to work with. This book was well written and easy to follow"
2,he should stick to acting,He was better on the grease soundtrack. Poor selection of songs on this one but nice poster with the vinyl recording.
3,Utility value,"This item has great utility value, when you discover that the cells in your torch are dead (due to your own neglect, might I add - has happened to me a couple of times).Cranking it does provide usable light for some time, but the initial intensity does not last long. Apart from a magnet cover (the magnet holding the crank handle in place while at rest) breaking off, the unit feels fairly solid. Claimed to be waterproof, but I have not tested it (and won't!).Unfortunately, the unit is rather bulky, and one of the LEDs is already looking a lot dimmer than the others. Most importantly though, the light intensity is NOT GOOD, even when the threee LEDs are on. This is not acceptable.So is it worth buying?For it's utility value, yes. Not for anything else, such as compactness/ illumination."
4,"WOW, no batteries needed!",These crank dynamo flashlights are just what you need for a weather emergency or in a storage compartment of a vehicle. The internal battery can be replaced not soldered.
4,All systems great!!!!,"This is their first full length LP. One Way System were basically a more sped up version of early Exploited. Nothing ground breaking or new for the time period but this record holds its own. One thing that does stand out, their recording comparing it to their counterparts has a much better cleaner and better produced sound. Don't let that scare you away. I would mention besides their early ep's this is probably the only OWS record you will need to own."
2,"Can not wait to get back to ""statahititi""","Are you kidding me? This is for beginners? This is for beginning contorsionists!! Sure I can handle a few of the yoga stances, like breathing and ""statahititi"". I almost had to call out of work today because I can not remove my leg from the back of my head. I will admit that this type of yoga kept me ""regular"" as far as peristalsis goes!I do not recommend for a beginner or intermediate."
1,"Mr. Freeman, you must be joking","I am a beginner, I admit, but I bought this video after taking yoga classes 5 times a week for three months, and the poses quickly went from familiar to impossible for me. Not challenging. Impossible. Only occasionally is an alternative posture offered. And yes, he does drone on, which is okay if you can come close to a pose and need time to breathe into it, but annoying when I'm sitting there, waiting for him to finish that one, hoping the next one is possible. And that's another frustration - why not stack the advanced poses at the end rather than primarily in the middle of this dumb video? Great, I've gotta go drop another $25 on something else. I know, I know, there's a caveat that says I won't be able to do some of these poses, but this is supposed to Level-freaking-ONE."
5,Well worth the price!!,I bought (2) of these as I needed to cover a 50' distance but was unable to find a 50' version of AR cable? Worked PERFECT!! Would buy again if I needed them as they are way cheaper and better quality than anything else I could find...
5,Quality cable :-),The quality is excellent and the connections are superb. Black was a dime a dozen but white was a bit difficult to find. Very pleased with this purchase!
5,Must Have Addition,"This game is absolutely fantastic. I've got a pair of buddies at work that I've conscripted into playing on lunch breaks, and we've all become addicted.The humor just keeps us laughing, and the ""But you must explain how"" conditions on some cards always create good times. I would highly recommend also purchasing the Sumo Size Me addition pack as the money and honor counters alone are worth it, not to mention the awesome new cards."
5,GREAT WRITER / GREAT PLAYER,"What got into HIGH FLYER. He should turn his hearing aid on. Maybe he doesn't like songs that tell real stories, but likes his music homogenized. MALICK writes from the heart and plays guitar with a warts and all style that is his. While no virutoso depending on blistering speed to get his point across, he plays with loads of feeling and without resorting to cliche's. Don't take HIGH FLYER's word for it. Both MALICK cd's ( the other one with AMYL JUSTIN ) are excellent listening and will grow on you with every listen. I have 1000 or so cd's and both of MALICK's cd's still get regular airplay. Only about 50 or so cd's that have been in my collection that long could make similar claims."
3,Inside,A very interesting account about life in prison. I would liked to have understood more about the incident that lead to the imprisonment and the feelings of the author going through such trauma. The story was very honest and factual but it was I felt only half of the story was told here.
2,Really?,Well done when he talks about his family life then it just kind of falls apart. Maybe the book got better later but I quit reading.
4,FANTASTIC!,"Every child headed down the wrong path should read this.One thing readers should know: this novel has a lot of British & psison slang in it, but the meaning of most can be found in kindle's dictionary.There were several mis-uses of ""an"" (such as ""an ten year sentence""), but perhaps that's how it's done there."
2,Russ Berrie Tabernacle Stannard Wind Chime,This a cheap knock off of a Stannard wind chime. It is made in China. Very thin aluminum bells sound very tinny. Not a complete waste however. Probably worth about $25.
3,A Hillarious Groaner,"It was as if M*A*S*H* became Sci-Fi. It' a B movie Science Fiction flick, in novel form. If it were an actual movie, you'd no doubt see it on Mystery Science Theater 3000. I laughed, I groaned, I rolled my eyes a bit. If you're not into puns, this book will be no pun for you."
5,"Great selection, great performance","Some great American music on this album, arranged for brass ensemble. Lots of fun. High-quality performance. Worth what you'll pay for it."
3,Better than buying the original 80s albums,"Obviously this isn't Bowie's greatest period; yet there are some great singles here (Ashes to Ashes, China Girl, Let's Dance). Overall, it's not an important disc. It was included in a box set with two other discs('69-'74 & '74-'79)that have been available for about ten years. People who own the other two discs were, of course, reluctant to purchase them again in a box set. For us, this disc is a welcome release and an essential purchase."
5,applicable to any business or organization,book contains lots of ideas and great examples . . . very inspirational . . . makes success simple . . . all we have to do is apply some of gross' POS thinking!!!
2,Unfortunately Unnecessarily Uneven,"Evidently Telarc didn't trust an album with just the lovely renditions of the Pops, instrumentalists and choruses so, attempting to reach younger or less sophisticated audiences, they felt obligated to add Toni Tenille, whose performance is fine but less classical in style than the orchestra and doesn't really fit and Sherrill Milnes whose bland singing confirmed his prior bout of well-publicized vocal distress and the obvious failure to recover his former beautiful quality. But the worst sin was including Rosemary Clooney's absolutely embarrassing renditions of two pop standards, with her age-ravaged voice of poor quality, lack of breath control and total inability to sustain any note. The treble boy's voice was not so attractive to my ears as to the others who wrote reviews. An album in the pattern of the old Philadelphia Orchestra albums would have been preferable, but any listener can just fast forward over the poorly sung tracks."
5,Fireside Favorites,"One of the best Christmas albums you will find. Perfect balance between religious favorites, non-religious classics, and children's favorites. All tastefully done and arranged to fit the theme of the song. Many of the percussion ""effects"" bring the songs to life and the solo and choral vocals are outstanding. Cannot recommend this album highly enough. A must have for any Christmas collection to be enjoyed for many years."
5,First book in a long time that I didn't want to put it down.,"My niece loaned the book while I was visiting, I finished it in two evenings. One of the most touching accounts of a pioneer womans struggles, and survival, mostly because of her deep religious faith. I have purchased Soaring Eagles and looking forward to reading it. I am planning on passing her books(all of them, eventually) to my neighbor and my daughter. I am going to suggest they be reviewed by the Book Club I belong to."
5,Great book for your pre-teen!,"What a great book for your pre-teen! Enough ""romance"" without the nitty-gritty details. I loved the storyline and ordered the 2nd and 3rd books right away. I worked in an elementary school library for 5 years and became good friends with one particular student. She would ask me to suggest books for her. To this day, we have continued our book club of 2! After I finished reading this series, she was delighted to get them. I know she will enjoy reading them over and over! Thanks for such a great series."
5,An Inspiring Book,"This really was a great book. I saw it on a bookshelf and bought it, thinking it'd be okay, but it was really good. The author seem to know a lot about the Lakota people, and about emotions. I really loved Walks The Fire and I can't wait to read the rest of the series."
3,"1st half good, 2nd half... not so good.","Decent start to this flick, but then the plot/story line seems it gets lost about half way through, and a little boring from that point on."
5,what minor pro hockey is all about,"HELLO HOCKEY FANS OF ALL LEAGUES. JUST WANT TO TELL U ABOUT LES CHEIFS OF LAVAL QUEBEC. THEY ARE A HOCKEY TEAM IN THE MINOR PROS. IT IS A AWESOME MOVIE. IT IS WHAT IT IS LIKE TO PLAY IN THE MINOR PROS, AND HOW HARD, AND WHAT THE PLAYERS DO TO TRY TO MAKE IT TO THE BIG LEAGUES. IF U LIKE HOCKEY U WILL LIKE THIS MOVIE. I RATED IT A 5 OUT OF 5"
3,If you are a Gale Harold fan buy it,"The first story was pretty good. The 2nd one i thought was boring. I loved the 3rd one, i thought they could have made a movie out of that one by its self."
4,Heatwarming and Heartbreaking...,"Three stories of three sets of Fathers and Sons all growing older together (at their own houses). The cycle-of-life as it effects the various families all neighbors on one street.Eventually as expected, the child becomes the parent, the parent dies and the sons take their place in the world as the parent (except for one son).Some moments are fast, some slow, some joyous and some unhappy. We live, we die.The story might not have discovered new ground, but the acting was marvelous and they had me laughing and crying. If you dislike sentimental films, you might have a little disappointment waiting for you."
2,Disappointed,The product was shipped in packaging to aviod physical damage. The heat (weather) extremely caused the packing to adhere and scar the item.This was not extreme weather conditions
4,Safe way to lose weight,"I used Puralin, quite few years ago but could not find it at our local pharmacy. Thank goodness, I found it at Amazon and it's helping me, again! It's medically safe even if you have some health problems."
1,It's not easy!,I disliked this product. Simply because IT IS SO DARN CONFUSING! Really! I couldn't figure this out! I guess I would only recommend it to someone who knows technology!~Kristina
4,Raunchey fuzz driven guitars offset with clean rythems,"Good songs, catchy heavy fuzzed out guitar riffs and some killer frenzied train wreck guitar solo's that I love. A must have for classic rock/proto-metal lovers. Tracks I really dug were ""Darkside"" running time 7:28 sweet. ""Live for Today"" 8:07 starts out mellow and builds up nicely, great tune. ""Zero Time"" my favorite, starts out heavy as hell and keeps on drivin'. The bonus tracks are good too, from my understanding they are from a previous recording session with a different lineup that didn't work out a few years earliar. The name fits for the time. It does have an overall dark feel too it. Rock on!"
5,"70,s Jem","Dark only make this one album and its a beauty . its a must have if you love 70,s prog / hard rock"
5,"Information, lore, and fascinating details for football fans","Texas Football Trilogy: A Season In The Lone Star State by Mitchell Krugel (Sports Editor, ""The Bergen Record"", Hackensack, New Jersey) is a comprehensive, informative look of the popular American sport of football in a state where the people take their team sports seriously. From an overview of the history of football to modern-day teams, celebrated coaches and the emphatic football season of 1998, Texas Football Trilogy is enhanced with a 16-page photo insert and a text filled with a wealth of information, lore, and fascinating details for football fans."
1,How difficult is it to make a battery that fits?,Simple review...the battery slides into unit...bottoms out in hole....cover that holds battery in hole not even close to fitting...bottom line battery is to long. At least battery will stay in hole during use as it goes in hoizontally.Currently trying to find someone to actually talk to at Amazon to see if I can get a correctly sized battery or do I have to return the whole package.
5,Class Brass Indeed,"This Classic album has stellar brass playing and should be more easily available. A must for aspiring musicians as an ""introductory"" recording."
2,Needs something to pep it up,"Two-thirds of the book takes place in a bedroom with angst from both parties. The book needs action from somewhere. This retelling of the Arturian legend could have been skipped. I was not impressed with the flow of language, the characters, or the plot. This author needs a rewrite."
3,"Good start (4), poor finish (2)","I really enjoyed the beginning of this book. The leading man was dark and dangerous and the lady smart and strong. I found the time travel to modern day and the references to modern technology and the use of modern slang to be extremely annoying and completely unnecessary. The story is set in a fantasy world, why travel to the 21st century? Then there's the ending. The story completely wimped out. Poof, invoke a magical solution and they lived happily every after. It killed the whole book for me."
2,Ho hum zzzzzzzzz,I am such a fan of the Darkhunter series and Brotherhood of the Sword etc. etc. that I thought this had to be more of the author's genius in writing. I was disappointed. The characters are lacking and one dimensional. I found Kerrigan's so called fascination with Seren to be lame. The story was very poorly developed and it took great effort and concentration to keep reading it to the end. My advice to Ms. Kenyon/MacGregor is to stick with her Dark Hunters. They are far more interesting and desirable.
1,Not what I expected,"I liked all of the Highlander and Brothers of the Swords books that Kinley wrote and highly recommend them, but I do not like this Avalon series at all and I wish she would write this series under her Sherrilyn plume. I am not in the least interested in her demon and dark books and I so wanted Kinley to finish the books about Lochlan and Kieran MacAlister."
5,"love it, love it and then some","Just finised reading the book and I loved it. I've been reading Kenyon's books so this was my first Macgregor's book and I fell in love with it. The characters were great,loving and easy to relate to and of course hot love scens.I'm looking foward to learn more about the lords of avalon, and their great antihero, Morgan and the way they can travel through time.I can't wait for the next one."
3,A good read!,This is the first of Kinley MacGregor's books I have read. I enjoyed the story line and found the book quick and easy to read. I felt there were too many characters floating around that could have easily been omitted which at time left me alittle confused about who was on what side. The relationship between the main characters was an interesting one and kept you reading on through. There are other books I would recommend before it but if you would like a good fantasy read with a bit of sauce this could be the one for you!
3,This was a letdown.,"After reading the McAllister series, I tried the first bookof the Lords of Avalon series. The first odd thing about thisbook is that it is endorsed on the cover by Sherrilyn Kenyon.I assume this is a joke as Kinley MacGregor and Sherrilyn K.are the same person. While much of this was interesting, Iwas disappointed that the hero and heroine have to bite eachother to achieve their goals. It's as if Ms. MacGregor harbors some deep desire to convert everyone to vampire romance. If I wanted to read those books, I'd read the Darkhunter series by MacGregor's alter ego, Sherrilyn Kenyon.There were some funny parts, especially the bit about the gargoyles finally fitting in at Star Trek conventions. However, I wouldn't waste a lot of time or money on this one."
1,I wanted to like this book....,"I have enjoyed most of Kinley/Sherrilyn's books but I couldn't even bring myself to finish this book. Great idea but so badly written. Modern slang/gargoyles that talk like Beavis and Butthead/cheesy love scenes/historically based villians that sound like bad Bold and the Beautiful dialogue etc. Kerrigan sounded hot and I loved the cover but the rest was such a disappointment. Quote from chapter 2: ""His body fired at the innocence he tasted, at the knowledge that no other man had ever tread upon this mouth before him"". I should hope that no other man had ever tread upon her mouth...sheesh.I am looking forward to the next Dark-Hunter novel, but I will pass on the Lord of Avalon series."
1,"Seriously, do yourself a favor and skip it!","I'm a fan of Kinley MacGregor's work. Love the ""Master"" series and the Brotherhood of the Sword books are great. The author stated that she interrupted her Brotherhood of Sword series because she was ""inspired"" to write this instead. Unfortunately inspirational isn't a word i could use to describe this. The descriptive words that DO come to mind include: trite, insipid, maladroit, and rudimentary. Considering the effort the author obviously put into coming up with the world in which this novel takes place, one would think she'd have put SOME effort into the plot This book was a real let down. Or rather a real put down, as i put it down half way through and couldn't bring myself to pick it back up. Do yourself a favor and skip it."
1,So... bad...,"This looked like a fun read, and I went into it with fairly low expections. Even those expectations were not enough to prepare me for how bad it was.When asked elsewhere what themes I disliked in romance novels, here is what I said, ""What irks me is when the romantic lead male is all dark and evil and boinks everything in sight, but some naive virginal girl suddenly brings out the good side of him apparently though the overwhelming power of her wholesome innocence."" That pretty much sums up the romantic storyline in this book as well its level of complexity.There are MUCH better romance books to be read, so don't waste your time on this one."
1,Disappointing,I have love Kinley Mac Gregor's books. Have even enjoyed the Dark Hunter series although I do agree they have become a regurgitation of one another. This book started out strong but then became bizarre. I had a hard time finishing it and that has never happened to me before with any of her books.
3,Good but not great,I am a big fan of Sherrilyn's Dark-Hunter series but I really was not drawn into this book. I had been very excited about it's publication after reading about it on her website and went out and bought it the day it came out but was not really drawn into the plot like I was with her other books like Unleash the Night. I felt like the characters were not fully developed and I never really sympathized with the struggles of the two main characters. I just hope that the other Lord of Avalon books will be more like the Dark-Hunter series.
5,"""another standout from kinley""","Another GREAT new series from kinley macgregor. while some of the charaters leave you guessing who and what they are, The focus should be and is on the main hero and heroine, and how the belief in yourself and in love can chage anyone. I LOVED IT!!!. Kinley shows again why she is such a fantatic writer. Her imagination is AWSOME, and the future shines brite for this star."
2,Disappointing!,"I give myself two stars for actually finishing this first book in the series. I loved the very beginning and felt the story had so much potential but the book went downhill fast. Morgen, the ultimate evil listening to INXS and the hero Kerrigan liking Papa Roach? What in the world happened? Seren and Kerrigan had so much potential but then the plot got bizarre and there were so many plot holes that the author I think got lost in her own story. Still I trudged through and made myself finish even when the story is thrown into the future where there is an RV, Star Trek conventions, and then I couldn't wait until the end.I really like Kinley's other books and just couldn't believe that she actually wrote this book. If I am going to read about Arthur, Merlin, and Camelot then stick to the time period! Make sure the dialogue is correct and don't throw in 20th century music."
4,Real estate dictionary,A very good word and pharse dictionary covering all aspects of real estate buying and selling terminology.
4,Essential Dictionary of Real Estate,"Useful book, especially when I'm stuck for an understandable definition of a real estate term. Some of the definitions are different than those given in the real estate class I'm taking. Then again, some terms have more than one definition, and both are correct. Not state-specific. This is for national."
4,The real thing,"Trina is everything I want in a singer/songwriter... soulful, emotional voice, truthful lyrics, interesting arrangements. Charming in person, and recorded."
5,Powerful Voice and Soul!,WOW! She communicates her HEART and SOUL with TALENT and STYLE that will knock your socks off.
4,DJ Enigma of Urban Prodigy Incorporated/Mo Wax Records......,"This album among others was definitely representing the Northwest. Many listeners will definitely feel ""Criminal Nation"" when they listen to this CD. I listened to the ""Resurrection"" CD that was given to me by Steven Brown at the WCW Spring Stampede. I also read one of the reviews for this CD stating that ""there was too much foul language."" I see it as just total expression!! I think Criminal Nation is on the verge of ""resurrecting"" the Northwest. There are not that many artist from the Northwest representing quite like CN. I even saw a WCW Pro Wrestler wearing yall stuff. Now That's on point!! To be honest, after Sir Mix-a-lot's music died out, I thought the Northwest would never come back up. Man, was I wrong!! CN is a very provocative and innovative rap group that has lot of potential. The group ""Black Caesar"" from Tacoma tried, but they just couldn't do what CN did."
3,"good, but needs more work.","I like the CD, but there is a lot of foul language in the songs and thats sort of dying out. Really not many rappers are using foul language. Its just a tab bit too much."
1,Not worth it,"Worst buy ever. Busted two sockets on first day. After second socket busted, became afraid to use this set. Warrenty is a joke, requires you to send socket back in mail with prepaid postage and hope thay replace it."
2,Positives and Negatives,"The socket set seems to be of good construction, however, the case is a little cheap of the quality. It is supposed to have 2 snaps to close it, but one of the snaps on mine, well, is snapped. The sockets aren't affected, but it feels like they could fall out when carrying the case."
4,Purple Jade Ring,"This is a very pretty ring. Mine was light purple with some imperfections in it that makes it clear it is a real mineral ring, not resin or something like that. I like that about it. Like the other reviewers suggest, a half size larger is a good idea.The gift box is very nice too."
5,Very pretty ring.,This ring is very pretty and looks great with all my other rings I wear. I highly recommend it. GemAvenue is a great place to do business as well.
2,DEFINITELY fragile!,"The seller is correct in stating that this ring is fragile. I wore this ring only once. When I was taking it off, it slipped out of my fingers and dropped approximately 8 inches into the sink bowl. The ring broke into 4 pieces. My concern would be that it might break while someone is wearing it - I would think it could cut someone."
2,Cute but break easy,The purple isn't that dark....I was disappointed that it was lighter in color. I had it for about two weeks and I was out with friends and hit my hand on the able and the ring shattered.
2,For the kids,"I ordered a purple ring. The one I received was a light pink color. I don't know if they sent me the wrong one or if the website picture was off. It also had a crack in it, but I wasn't sure if that was an inherent part of this kind of jade. It didn't cost very much, so it wasn't worth my time to return it. It came in a cute heart-shaped box with a bow on top. I just gave it to my 3 year old daughter to play with. She liked it. She had it for a couple months and dropped it on a hard floor then it shattered into pieces. Oh well. She enjoyed it while it lasted."
4,Perfect Speaker Stand,I've had these speaker stands for several years now...and they're stood the test of time and 3 boys. Quality was excellent and they were extremely easy to assemble and situate.
3,Good Enough,There a little wobbly but they get the job done. Dont reccomend them for carpeted surface as a little off-balance will make them lean.
5,The Best Doo Wop,"For anyone into ""other than mainstream"" doo wop, this is a cd for you. There were hundreds of regional individuals and groups that never went national and this cd features some. Even a couple from The Tophats who went on to become the Earls. Del and The Escorts have a few excellent songs as do others. Do yourself a favor and buy this. I promise, you eon't be sorry."
5,"Gorgeous, and let me tell you about the Moraga Pear Pie!","Beautiful book in every way - the layout, the artwork, the photographs, the research...and the RECIPES. I've made maybe 10 things from this collector's item of a book. But let me talk at some length about the Moraga Pear Pie. It's fantastic - and here's a favor. There's a way to make it even more superlative with a better crust:In a food processor, put 2 c flour, 3 T. sugar, and 3/4 cup of butter. Blend till mixed and crumbly. Then add 2 egg yolks and blend just till it forms a ball. With your fingertips, press it evenly into an 11 or 12 inch tart pan. Bake for 10 minutes at 325.Then proceed with the rest of the Moraga Pear Pie recipe - and serve the tart to the Queen. I guarantee she'll ask for the recipe."
1,Worst Ever Story,This book drove me silly. I struggled to get through it. The plot was insanely boring. There was one exciting bit - just before the end when a character falls down the cliff - finally some suspense! I DO NOT recommend this book at all!
5,Trumpet Spectacular,A great selection of music. Severson's performance is outstanding. Sound reproduction is exceptionally good. If you enjoy trumpet you should have this CD
4,Lively yet relaxing,"When it's only music I wish to hear, I find the CD an easy listen. The orchestra complements the well done trumpet solos."
5,Trumpet Spectacular,My grandson and his parents were very very pleased and thought this was an excellent selection. My grandson has been playing trumpet since age 6. He is now 14 and has records of all the great trumpet players and thinks this one is one of the best.
5,"It's not the ""Tonight"" show any more!","The entire disc is superb and who knew Doc could play like this? Wow! And of course, being an Ohio native, the fact that it's the Cincinnati Orchestra is just a bonus."
5,Sonic tour de force,"I have been a fan of Doc's for decades, but the reason I am recommending this album is the sound. It is an incredible recording. Combine the searing sonics with the astonishing energy of Doc and you get an album that will literally blow you away. Provided you have a good enough sound system. Otherwise, it's still a nice album."
3,"Amazing technic, but poor tone.","I listened to this cd and the technic is truly amazing. This guy is really good-BUT-he has that nasty jazz tone that doesn't do well in classical music. Especially disturbing is the Bach-Busoni Chaconne. Listen to the piano performance by Evgeny Kissin and you'll know what I mean. Good for motivation for brass students, but if you want some really good, sweet classical, go somewhere else."
5,Fantastic,This is one of the best DVD concerts that I have seen. John Legend is great and he puts on a fantastic show.....loved it and will watch it more than once.
2,let-down,"This book has been long-awaited. I cannot believe that it took the authors years to write this crap. Don't get me wrong, it is entertaining enough and reads quickly but nowhere near as good as the other books in the wonderful series. It is far too short and cursory in many of its aspects. It is a big let-down. I guess the authors figured that those who liked the series will read the book no matter how badly it is written. I was dissapointed."
5,A good 're-do' of a great film!,"John Wayne at his best, and the people who created the DVD, from theoriginal film, did a great job!ANNA MARIE FRITZ [...]"
4,Children need their Fathers,I liked this movie for the simple reason it showed that although John Wayne the father had not been with his boys like he should he suddenly realizes what he has missed out on. They really need him and he needs them. He also teaches them a lesson in a very hard way to be honest and truthful.
5,Classic Duke,"Classic John Wayne at his best. Color,plot, and scenery are great. If you have a collection this is a must have."
4,cahill us marshall,good movie with john wayne. a western with a little different twist to the conventional western. wayne is estranged from his sons who of course get into trouble involved in a robbery. good cast
2,Dull in the Saddle,"A tired John Wayne vehicle from the 1970s, with the Duke going through the motions in a typical Western melodrama. Director Andrew V. McLaglen shows little enthusiasm for the preachy script while underusing a fine array of character actors. The opening scene falls painfully flat in its attempt to emulate Clint Eastwood's ""Dirty Harry."" Sorry to say, but ""Cahill"" looks like a made-for-TV movie that somehow acquired a major box-office star."
5,Fan of the Duke,"Always loved John Wayne movies, there isn't one I don't like. Could sit and watch them all day and night."
5,Classic John Wayne,"John Wayne is the ever powerful marshal with two sons that feel neglected, and rightly so, and how they bond through the boys acting out. Good western to boot! Some great humor and humbleness add to the watching."
5,Super Shootout,"This movie is a good study of a father's relationship with his sons. The main reason I bought this DVD was to be able to see the vlassic opening scene of a John Wayne shootout against overwhelming odds. There is a bit of stolen valor revealed in this scene. John Wayne is shot in the shoulder by what is identified as a Spencer but it is actually a Henry, (probably a Winchester with the forestock removed). Both are repeaters going back to the Civil War but the Spencer is much more powerful. Until Clint Eastwood's ""Unforgiven"" most people did not know the difference. The Spencer was overwhelmingly the dominant repeater in the war and played a large, though untold, role in the West."
4,Classic John Wayne,"HII at least didn't remember seeing this John Wayne classic. The only thing missing in this movie (in a way) is Maureen O'Hara. John Wayne is a widowed father of two boys, whom he never sees. They get bored and do bad things. Cahill gets them out of trouble. Predictable, but good."
1,cahill-us marshall,I still haven't received this. It has been almost 2 months and my emails to importcd's remain unanswered. I cannot recommend this company to anyone.
5,great film,another film that a lot of people overlook. wayne plays this character to a level far and few can or could match. although not his normal venue he makes a convincing character come to life and the other actors compliment the wayne style.
1,Another Duke Turkey,"CAHILL--U. S. MARSHAL is another Duke turkey. One of a seemingly unending stream he cranked out in the late sixties through the mid-seventies. On top of which, it is violent and downright cruel. The original script was a modern-day urban cop story. Duke had it rewritten as an oater. Better he should have passed."
1,did not receive,I did not receive this product. I was credited back for the charge. I was informed that the item was defective.
1,bad sale,Did not see enough info that this video can only be viewed in other areas other than the U.S.. Very disappointed and will not purchase another dvd from amazon!!
5,wonderful smell,"I had this in a cone form, cannot find it anymore. That was 40 years ago. I was thrilled to find it was still out there!! Wonderful smell!"
3,Guessing game,"Great product, great vendor. My distress, is because I have bought several of these, and Nikon does a bad, bad job of relating the pouch part number with the lens that fits it. So you go back and forth to Nikon's web site looking for a part number that is on a lens that may be similar. Then you order. It's a guessing game."
5,Amish lifestyle,"This was a page turner for me...even under the covers late at night. I am hooked! Very realistic in that misunderstandings happen, and people jump to conclusions when they do not wait for answers."
5,Must read,"Highly recommend this must read. Once I started this series I could not put these books down well written. Grammar is even good,"
5,Superb,"I loved this book and all the books in the ""Abrams's Daughters"" series. I am not Amish but I believe in a lot of the same values as protrayed in these books."
5,Love of family & love for another,This story amazed me because of the character`s love and respect for each other. I enjoyed the storyline and plan to read more of Beverly Lewis` books. I think she has helped remind us about the power of love. (Jana from East Texas)
4,Great book,What a great way to follow the first book. I was definitely a little surprised by the turn of events but it was easy to figure out once the conclusion got closer. All in all I can't wait to read the next book.
4,"What, it's over already?","This was an excellent read. It flowed much better than the first one. I really like this series, and I can't wait to read the next book."
3,Too expensive for such an easy read,"I enjoyed the story and had wanted to know more after finishing ""The Covenant"", however, I will not be purchasing any more of the series. They are relatively pedestrian in style and quality. I would still quite like to know what happens to the girls but need much more for $9.68."
3,Book gets better,"I gave this book a three star rating because it drags on a bit much for me. I do admit that it did pick up near the end, enough so I purchased the rest of the series."
5,PS3 Blue Screw replacement,"Those of you that have replaced the hard drive inside a PlayStation 3 know that the little BLUE screw can get easily stripped. The only way to replace it would be to send it back to a repair shop. Sony offers no replacement screws through the mail. So, after looking around I found that these little M3 x 5 work perfectly well. In fact, they not only replace the BLUE screw. But also the four silver harddrive screws that are used on the carrier (sometimes those can get stripped as well).Even though they aren't flat headed, they still fit fine when placing the hard drive back into the PS3."
