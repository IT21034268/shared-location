3,Ok at best,"You could say it was a fabulous book because it demonstrated a point that humans are animals without society... yada yada yada. But a book should be more than that, it should be emotionally envolving. You should feel for the characters, but you just can't in Lord of the Flies. It's OK for illustrating a point, but not good enough to pass for a real novel."
5,A Great Read!,"I read this book a year ago, but I still remember almost exactly what happened. The book is burned into my memory. That's how good it was. It's a tale of a boy growing up, and the evil in our society. We see how the boys decivilize during their stay on the island, and degenerate into savage groups. As in Jack London's ""The Call of the Wild,"" the characters revert to their natural instincts. In this case, the boys become savage group hunters, similar to eary humans thousands of years ago. This book is hard to understand; cryptic, but will give you a new view of the world."
2,I don't like the book,I am a fan of classic literature but this book was just too slow for me. Everyone should read it because it's a classic but I didn't enjoy it.
5,A REVIEW OF THE BINDING,"The novel itself is excellent, a modern classic. But what I always want in a book review is a description of the binding, so here it is. The Classics of Modern Literature Series has done an excellent job in printing handsome modern classics, including 'The Godfather' and 'The Once and Future King'. This book has no dust jacket, the colors and lettering are printed on to the cover. I find this preferable, because dust jackets are a bit of a hassle. There is no lengthy introduction, and the last page of the book that has writing on it is the last page of the novel itself. So this book is very straightforward. It does have a bar code printed on the bottom of the back cover, which may not bother some, but I don't like it. Other than that though, I don't see how they could have done a much better publishing job. This is a great edition of a great novel."
5,Survivor Explained,"I was fortunate to read this book in the 8th grade, it explained all the social interactions of Junior High School. Unfortunately many people never get past Junior High society. The popularity of Survivor has demonstrated this, the weak, the different, and the above average are rejected by the collective might of the average and mediocre. No dissent or thought is encouraged or permitted. An elite few determine what is correct and acceptable. Here is the social model of Liberalism, Socialism, and Communism, you are free to say whatever you want, as long as you agree with them. Personal attacks replace any debate on issues. It is no wonder this book is no longer used in public schools, it raises to many embarrassing issues."
2,Lord of the Flies,"We've just recently read this book at my middle school some of my classmates and I found this book to be unappealing. I thought it was actually a boring book even considering all of the violence. In my opinion, Golding picked a subject for each chapter and dwelt on it. I thought that this was a slow-moving book. Also the way he wrote things was kind of ""beating around the bush."" So my advice to you is if you do not have to read this book, don't."
3,Boring,I've read all of the other reviews and I have to say that I think they're all wrong. Maybe it's because I read it when I was 13 and it was to sophisticated but I thought it was extremly boring. fter reading the other reviews I think I'll try it again
2,Ickkk,"I'll preface this by saying I was made to read this in the 10th grade, but I really did not like this book. And I graduated college with an English degree. Maybe it's just a boys book, I don't know, but it disturbed me to read and I was thinking the whole time ""this would never happen, this is the stupidest thing I have ever read."" Perhaps this is a classic, but would I tell people to buy it? No."
2,am I the only one who didnt like this?,"I just finished reading Lord of the Flies in my gr. 11 English class and I wish that this book was not required to be read in school, because I do not recommend it. Although it was thought provoking, and at times you really felt for the characters, it was too grim a look at mankind. I entirely disagree with Golding's idea of mankind being inherently evil, and that made it hard to get into the book and also made it hard to believe. This was fairly well written, but I have read books that challenged my intelligence more. It is obvious that Golding wrote this book as a way of getting his point across to people, and you can see this because the reading comprehension is pretty simple and most people can breeze through it. I felt that it was borderline propaganda, and I actually regret that i have read it, but I didn't have much choice in the matter."
3,"A well-written book, but...","Lord of the Flies was a well-written book. I will admit that. But it was boring for most of the book. SO you think I contradicted myself? Okay, it's well written in a sense that it has good language use, and lots of symbols (I seemed to like it more after we talked about it in class for English), but when I was reading it on my own over the summer, I thought it was EXTREMELY boring, and I could not concentrate and would have to read chapters again and again because it was one of those books that your eyes are reading but your brain isn't absorbing. It only got interesting until (sorry to spoil it), but when people start killing each other, and that was about chapter 10 (out of 12).THIS BOOK was rather DULL but if you like symbols and such then read it for the sake of that, but NOT for ENTERTAINMENT purposes."
2,More disturbing than interesting,"After reading this book, I think William Golding is a sick, sick man. The book portrays small boys as savages trying to kill each other. Some might find it entertaining, but I find it downright disturbing. I only read it because it was required for school, but I wish I'd burned it instead."
1,Read the book instead,"This is a horrible audio book, read by the author. He offered an engaging prologue, but the reading of the book was just awful. The author was monotone, sighed while reading, and in general, sounded bored with the book. His reading does a disservice to the excellent story that he crafted."
3,Lord of the Flies,"I think this book was a very boring book but on the other hand it was very interesting to see what william golding thought about ""human nature"". After i read this book i started realizing that in some books you have to look deeper than what it says. What everything means. I liked how everything had a meaning but i didnt like how it was really hard to figure out what everything means. This book was like a puzzle. Everything had its place that fit."
3,Randi's Review,"I think that the book,Lord Of The Flies, was a pretty good book.There were a few things that I thought were very gross.But I thought about the way my brother acts and then I thouoght about how true it was.I disliked the way they killed piggy just because he couldn't see.I like the way Ralph treats everyone with respect.I think the book was very wild and very fantastic."
3,lord of the flies,"In this book, william golding puts forth his veiw of mans instinctive nature. After you have read this book you will start to see it in everyone. You will see the nature of modern humans and how they work. This book will open your eyes. Theres nothing i dislike about the book at all."
3,A Critic to Society?,"This book has been widely discussed and read, regarded as classic and worth of a Nobel Prize for William Golding. For some reason I had my reserves about it, I do with most ""classics"", but I decided to read it anyway. Even though is haunting and beautifully written; I was left with the feeling that this was just a novel of kids stranded on a desert island that could have been much better. And most of the critic to human nature and society is just a lot of hype."
4,"British boys bond, build, and break","This is one of those classic books that many read in middle school; however, if you do not get the chance too then, well, grab it now.When an accident of some kind leaves a group of young British boys stranded on an island, they must find a way to survive. Yet this book is more then just a book of Crusoe survival. In fact, this could be Golding's sociological view of youth when tested. Of course, this is solely fiction.Either way though, this story of cohesion and division can touch one, but then it can also frighten. Now whether that skill is attributed to the plot or Golding's writing is debatable, although it's probably both.Like I said though, this is a classic for all, espesically the middle-schooler."
4,"Intriguing Story line, plot drags a little.","This novel has an interesting view of human nature and its primal tendancies. The quality of writing and imagery is masked a little by over-usage of detail statements. The characters are complex and interesting, but the story could be told equally as effectively in 125 pages as it was in 202. In short: good book, worth buying."
4,I really liked this book.,"I really liked this book. It is one of my favorites. After I read it, I had a different outlook on things."
2,there was to much symbolisem which made the plot line boring,"I recently read this book in my freshmen english class, Along with everybody in my class I was bored with it. I did understand all the symobolisem, but it just came across as a book with a Lack of excitment"
2,A little hard to understand,"I'm currently reading this book as required reading for next years English class. I'm about half way through and so far, I'm having to force myself to pick it up and continue reading. The plot is sometimes hard to understand and the dialouge is hard to follow. There are often places where there is no indication as to who is saying what. I also find the beginning a little confusing. I know that the plane was shot down but WHY? Was it an accident or was it on purpose? The book is good, I guess, but you really have to WANT to read it."
3,"Readers made this book ""great""","The first book Golding wrote and the only book he wrote considered anywhere near classic level. I think the things people have come up with as symbolism in this book are absurb. Comparisons to Conrad should not be taken seriously. I think it has more of the aspects of a political novel. It pokes fun at how democracy's choose their leader and at fascist governments, tyrants, and at pagan rulers. This novel also shows the humans need of some type of spiritual beliefs. Golding intended this as both a slightly symbloic novel and an adventure story. The happy ending is a testament to that. Clearly not deserving of a spot in the top 100 books of the century (at least not in the top 20) it is still a good effort by golding and a book for lovers of implied ideas. The poor plot and impossible keeps it from being great."
5,The reader from St. Louis is dead wrong,"Hey, reader from St. Louis: I don't think so. Yeah, forget Lord of the Flies -- just read Into Thin Air! Are you kidding? This is one of the greatest works of the 20th century. While you are at it, why not read some Danielle Steele -- it's better than this Golding garbage!"
1,It's no Hunger Games!,"Lord of the Flies is alright I guess. I mean, I know it's a classic, but the plot is distinctly lacking in so many ways, you feel like it should be updated for today's readers. For instance, there are no touchscreen interfaces OF ANY KIND in this book. Nobody has a camelback or even an earth-friendly stainless steel water bottle. And unless I'm forgetting something, there's no suggestion whatsoever that aliens or supernatural intruders are secretly present on the island. I don't know, I guess there's just a lot of missed opportunity in this book. Maybe whoever wrote it should think about some revisions? Because as it is, there's really not much to it except a searing journey into mostly unanswerable questions about what it is to be human."
1,Incredibly dull,"In my opinion, this is one of the most boring books ever written. Sure, Golding is trying to make a point about power's effect on social stability and structure, but it is lost in the mumbo jumbo style that he writes with. (The movie is also a pathetic depiction of this cliché-ish message.) There are so many books out there that deal with this same topic, and because of this common subject matter, a novelist needs to be truly inventive to create a real masterpiece. This book should not be ranked anywhere near the top 100 novels on the Modern Library Association's list of the best novels of the 20th century."
4,Man or Monster?,"This book was truly excellent. It really shows how civilization can collapse when people are faced with uncivil conditions. It also has some great metophorical things in it that show you that there is more to the book than you may think. It was kind of hard to sit down and read, and I had to go back and re-read some parts, but other than that, I recomend this book to anyone who wants a really facinating novel that will make you think. The good things definatley out-weigh the bad."
4,Human nature...,"This novel was a very symbolic and accurate detail of the irony of human nature. It delivered with subtle power the message that we are all capable of tearing each other apart. Although slow to start off with, ""The Lord of the Flies"" finished with a punch and kept me thinking about the messages it sent for days afterwards. A good read."
3,"It was decent, a bit mediocre.","Lord of the Flies was somewhat of a disappointment. One of the problems was that there were too many minor incidents occurring at once, such as the fire going out, Ralph and Jack arguing, and Piggy complaining about other people talking when someone has the conch. I also thought the characters didn't seem very realistic. I felt that they didn't think and act like kids in real life would. How many 15 year olds honestly think there are beasts and ghost things in the world? Overall, it was a decent book to read, but one that I would not hurry back to the library to read again."
3,It was one of the most confusing books I have ever read.,"This book would have been interesting if I would have understood what was going on. It was very difficult to know what was going on. At points you had to decide what it meant. There were many different meanings to this book. At first I thought I understood it but by the middle of the book I was totally confused. If you like adventure and survival books, give it a shot. You never know you might like it."
3,it's wasn't interesting!,I't started out with a bunch of boy that were deserted on an island and starded a war. It has no meaning to it because it wasn't fasinating enough to be reading a book(novel) like this!!
3,Realistic?,"I'm aware that this book is a classic and is very popular but it just didn't do it for me. Maybe I am too much of an optimist but I really can't see a group of boys turning into killing machines that quickly just because they are trapped on an island. Fighting, of course; stabbing and attacking, not so much. Like I said, maybe I just think to highly of people, but this book just seemed so unrealistic to me that it lost all of the chilling effect that it is supposed to evoke. However, it was a fun read and I really liked the ending."
2,Not for Me,"I love to read, but I'm the kind of person that needs the book to capture my interest, draw me in. I want to forget to eat, breathe even... and this book didn't do it for me."
3,Has not aged well,"Better than the last book I read but a bit too innocent for it to speak to us today. It didn't age well. I think we need far more to shock us today and so much of the significance is lost. A great book, in its time and context, no doubt."
5,Review/Blog,"The book is about a plane crashing leaving a bunch of kids stuck on an island. They are celebrating their independence at first but after a while their chance of being rescued is slim. Day to day, they create their own laws and rules to somewhat form their own government. The moral of the book is the importance of the government and how it regulates the rules and laws.I would recommend this book because its very suspenseful and leaves you guessing. The Morals and values can relate to my life and may relate to yours too. The value of the government is often taken for granted as we don't follow the Laws/Rules. The book teaches the importance of how you should follow the laws and to not be a menace in society."
3,Lord of the Flies,"I thought that Lord of the Flies was an average book. At times it was really exciting, but at other times I found myself just looking at the words instead of reading them. It took me a while to get into the book. I would recommend this book if you are into books that make you think, but if you're not a thinker then I wouldn't recommend it."
2,Book review for Lord of the Flies,"The book ""Lord of the Flies"" was confusing at the start, but as it progressed it got better as the story unfolded. The book was about a bunch of boys stranded on a island after a their plane crashed. As the story gets going a group of the boys become savage with out rules to go by. Many of the boys die, but some are saved in the end of the book. I only recommended this book to someone who doesn't mind demonic behavior or violence otherwise don't read this book."
4,Lord of the Flies by William Golding,"I was made to read this book this year in school ..., so I assumed that it would be horrible...like most all of the books that we have to read for school. But surprisingly Lord of the Flies was actually pretty good. I think I would've enjoyed it much more if we didn't have to read it so quickly (in about 1 weeks) and have to take so many notes about it and then have a test. The messages in symbols in this book are VERY strong and is a good book that has a lot of meaning in it. I would recomend this to anyone who hasn't read Lord of the Flies but is looking for a fairly short, powerful novel to read"
3,Lord of the Flies,"This book is about boys that are stranded on an island, no adults in sight. In order to stay alive they must hunt and make fire, but in the process, some of the boys get into dangerous situations. The boys crown a chief to keep themselves civilized, keeping things like they were back home. In the book, the characters meet a mysterious creature that scares the boys. I would not totally recommend this book to everyone, if you have a lot of free time it could be useful."
4,Human nature exposed,"Lord of the flies is, to me, a metaphor of human history. A group of boys ends up in a desert island after a plane crash and they have to struggle to survive. The battle of leadership begins shortly and two styles arrise. One is a symbol of order and civilization. The other is the opposite: anarchy and barbarism. Everything happens through the eyes of these boys, whose hope is to rescued. Highly recommendable if you liked Animal Farm for example."
5,Lord of the Flies tells about what it takes to be a leader.,"I just finished Lord of the Flies not more then 20 mins ago.I had my doubts on this book very much.I have read many books in my life but this one had one of the best endings.I wasn't that happy with the book for the first 100 pages or so,but the rest was all good from there.Lord of the Flies shows the meaning of the struggles it takes to be a leader.There were key moments in the book nthat foreshadowed the ending.One was in the Beginning when Jack Showed a certain quality that showed that he had the quality to be a leader.When Ralph blew the Conch the First words that JAck said were ""Who is the man with the trumpet?""That foreshadows the leader qualities he has by his curiosity for his choir's sake.I am not going to go any more into detail but you should buy this book and do not give up on it.It has a great ending that you will enjoy."
4,A Book For Everyone,"The book written by William Golding, Lord of the Flies is a great book. It not only captures the minds of readers of every age, but it states a point about human nature. I think Golding's point in writting this book is to tell show us that there is a ""beast"" in all of us. As young Simon so clearly states. I agree with him on this point because at one point and time we all can loose control and become ""savage"". Golding was brilliant for using children to bring this point across, because so often we think of children as being the complete example of innocence. And I think as the years progress or situations change, we gradually loose our innocence. This book was great and I would recommend it for children and adults of all ages."
2,My Review,"In my opinion, Lord of the flies was on of the dullest books I have ever read. It started off slow and at times I found myself trying hard not to fall asleep. The plot was actually quite interesting, but William Golding wrote it in such a way, sometimes I couldn't understand exactly what was going on. His word choice left me scanning through a dictionary a majority of the book. Yet this book did contain some quite profound symbolism. The theme would have to be the best party of this novel, being it relates to the real world or the cruelties of the real world.Some of the scenes in this book are actually quite violent, and unrealistic being that the kids are so young. In fact, numerous times I became sick to my stomach. Some of the scenes were good and beautifully written but overall I felt most of it was superfluous ."
4,Still a great read,"Like most high-school kids, I read ""Lord of the Flies"" and forgot about it. That is until this year when I was forced to read it again in order to teach it to my tenth-grade class. I had forgotten what a great read it is. As a teen, I missed out on so much that Golding had intended. Today--now that I'm a little older, a little better at understanding novels--I see so much more. The symbolism is wonderful, as is the book as whole. Plus: this is a beautiful edition and the E.M. Forster intro is brilliant. If you are looking for a heavy read, you might want to try something else. But, if you're looking for a great, quick read, give ""Lord of the Flies"" a whirl."
4,Lord of The Flies,"Lord of The Flies, by, William Golding is basically based on a childhood fantasy everyone would like to explore.The book mainly revolves around a group of English teenaged boys whos plain crashes on a desserted island.The boys basically have to live and fend for them selves without grown-ups. Scavenging for food,building huts,tools,weapons,and defending themselves against the island monster. All in all if you like the thrill of a hunt and remember the fantasies of living on a deserted island as a kid this book is for you."
5,Excellent Depiction of a Cruel and Barbaric Society,"A great book... A wonderful depiction by Golding of a group of teenage boys that are supposed to be ""civilized"" boarding-school students but turn wild and barbaric as a result of the harsh island environment that they are set in. This book provides a powerful representation of our own society, and how these animalistic natures all exist in the underlying shadows. Although the adult in his ship rescues the kids at the end, the point is made by Golding in the Epilogue that, even though the kids are rescued, who will rescue the adult? Lord of the Flies connects all readers with its harsh, gritty setting and the personalities of all characters"
5,A must read!,"I've been meaning to read this book for a long time now. I've heard about it since my school days but never really had the urge to pick it up. Honestly, I'm glad I waited. I don't think I would have appreciated the novel quite as much as I do now if I had read it in my teen years.Though this book was published in the 50's, it is relevant today. It is raw human nature at its finest. It is audacious, and I love it! It is a haunting depiction of society - an allegory of civilized mentality, which is revealed here as chaos.I thoroughly enjoyed this book."
5,The truth of man lived out in children,This book is a classic because it shows how human flaws and strengths can lived out and experienced by mere children
1,"Wow, that was pretty bad!","I think Golding really screwed up on this one...I found the plot really boaring and unrealistic. There were too many characters and most were undeveloped. And just when I thought the novel was the worst thing I ever encountered, I saw the old black and white Lord of Flies Movie. I really honestly think that a three-year old directed this...P-U."
2,Took too long,"It's great ordering a book, and the book was good, but the delivery took so long that I had to go to the bookstore and get it for my daughters class anyway, so it was really a waste. Shouldn't take over two weeks to get a book."
1,a big disappointment,"After all I had heard and read about Golding's Lord of the Flies I was expecting a novel story, not a Rbinson Crusoe cliche, or at least some good writing/language, but what I got was a story that could have been conjured up by my 11 year old kid: lots of repetition (the conch, the glasses, the beast, the fire)and not what one could term an erudite piece of writing. How this book gets onto college lists is beyond me. Are we actually meant to interpret/understand the vague imagery, if that's what it is? Boring. Unfortuantely this is my first Golding book, and I'm afraid it will be my last... for some time at least."
4,Shows the true nature of man vs. survival,"I just finished this book for English, and I felt it nailed its message pretty well. The symbols and deeper meanings are really an early attempt at exploring the true nature of children vs. their morals under survival situations. It is sad seeing how young boys can do this to each other, but it is very realistic in its psychological views, and shows how anyone has the ability to give into power and impulses under the right circumstances. The ending just pieces everything together, and shows the true impact the actions have caused these boys emotionally, even though it is a little anti-climatic. In the end, the basic moral is to not give in to your natural impulses so quickly and not to be quick to judge other people. It also teaches you that anyone has the ability to turn evil when given power, but there will always be those with morals who continue to fight on."
1,lord of the flies,I didnt like this book.It was very boring and slow.I think that the book was very slow.The book was not good I would not read it again.I dont recommend this book to you.But you can read it if you want to.I am think that the rating is a 1. I didnt like this book at all I will not read it again.You shouldnt.I like about the book I liked. Not very muth but there is some stuff that is kind of cool like they call this fat kid piggy.
2,Lord of the Flies,"This allegorical novel fails to deliver to its acclaim. I had to read this for school, I barely got through the first few pages. It wasn't very realistic--little kids on an island to survive by themselves? The characters were not very much likable, besides Ralph, the others were barbaric, avarice and savage. The plot was hackneyed--I mean how many stories have there been about people who land on an island in the middle of no where and try to survive? I wouldn't reccomend this book."
1,The worst book I ever read,"This is the worst book I ever read. From the first time I read it 40 years ago, I could not imagine why it had not been banned. The viewpoint of mankind presented is so degraded and ugly that it should be. There is NO REASON to expose our young people to such negativity. No wonder they have so many psychological problems! Please, teachers, read positive works with your young students. The world is not like that, and it is our job to give them positive views for their future and ours!"
4,Down with the Pork,"The Sticky actually enjoyed this book as it reminded him of a certain porky guy he knows that also deserved to suffer the same fate as the porky guy in the book. He was charmless, had no sense of humor and also spoke like a cartoon character...."
3,Clearly demonstrates the depravity of mankind,"Although a bit sickening in places, Golding has proved that man is sinful. Even children can commit horribly violent acts without being taught. It is a shame that this book is actually a common part of High School Literature courses."
1,I hate this book,"this book is uneventful and is savage, it ends poorly and overall I think it is really bad. If you really get into the philospphy behind this book, you'll find its almost depressing. On top of it, it is unrealistic."
1,ok if you like adventure...,"For english class we had to read Lord of the Flies by Golding.. It was an ok book... if you like adventure stories... personally i dont. however Goldings use of symbolizm is great. The book sickened me at certain parts. The descriptions were great but after reading an entire chapter and then some more descriptions, it gets sort of boring. However i did like how Jack and Ralph TRIED to get along in the beggining you know BEFORE Jack went crazy. I also liked Goldings purpose of this book... how deep down, we are savages. And he was right."
1,*WARNING* DO NOT READ THIS BOOK!!!!!!!,"Hola- We read this book in our Freshman english class. The overall review was that it wasn't good, in fact it was BAD! We recommend that you do not read this book. We have nothing against the author, but we perfer reading interesting books, unlike this one. We didn't like the deaths, savagness, or irresponsibility of the children. THey needed to communicate with each other. If this book had a sequel I think that would be boring, but atleast you'd fing out what happened. THe book went to slow and the plot used too much symbolism. This book deserves 0 stars, but that wasn't an option! Hasta Luego- iSABeL and r0sA"
1,DONT READ THIS! NO!!!!,"I have looked at all the reviews on this book and I have found that most of them are 5 and 4 stars!!! How could that be???? This is one of the worst books that I have ever read! The descriptions are meaningless and when the author do describes something he takes a page to describe something that should take 3 sentences at the most. I did not like the plot of this story and although it had an interesting idea I don't think the author did much with it. It is full of violence that is un-needed. If you see this book on the shelves, cover your innocent eyes from this evil, and run! DO NOT LOOK BACK! If this book was a horse, I would shoot it! It is very annoying to read and this book scares little children!"
1,What a waste of time!!,I really hated this book. I only read it because I was forced to read it in school. I think that the author is trying too hard to write a good book. There must have been a reason why this was out on the market for 5 years before anyone picked it up. The author tells you too much information in a short amount of time. He starts to talk about something and then just moves on to something else. He also leaves you hanging. He also uses way too many uncompleted sentences! Reading this book was a complete and total waste of my time!!!!!!
3,a good book,"I think the author was trying to tell us that everyone has some kind of evil inside them. I agree with him because everyone isn't perfect. The best literary element in the book was the characters. I like how each character had its own great personality.It was a believable because without rules, crazy things like that can happen. The book could of be better if the begining was so slow and had more action in it. Overall i really liked the book."
5,A thrilling journey into the dark side of the human psyche.,"'Lord of the Flies' was written to show that no matter how civilized the human race thinks it is, it is all an illusion created for our own safety. We are all animals in soul, if not in mind. I was drawn into the book, I thought of the characters as real people, with real problems, and real personalities. I feared for the characters lives, for Golding's one-in-a-million writing style brought the story to life. 'Lord of the Flies' had to be one of the most believable books I've ever read. With an exciting, realistic plot; well-thought out characters; excellent imagery; and superb symbolism. I recommend this book to anyone who wishes to see the hidden side of the human spirit."
5,"""All we have is the rules""","Ever fantasize that you are on an island free from the restraints of society? William Golding has taken that scenario to the nth in this story of a bunch of English boys, plane wrecked on an island during WWII.We see the fabric of society slowly and most assuredly ripping as the rules are discarded one by one. Golding is very graphic in his description of the demise of pigs and plants.One will never look at fun and games in the same way.Lord of the Flies: Essential Art House"
5,My time to hold the Conch,"A true masterpiece. To me on par with ""Heart of Darkness"" and ""Crime and Punishment"" on the subject of human nature. Each of the boy's, or groups of boy's, personalities are spot on in representing individual human traits. Death, innocence, jealousy, it's all disturbingly spot on. This is a must read for anyone."
5,A Classic,"Lord of the Flies by William Golding 5/5I first read Lord of the Flies in high school, as do many Americans, and recall being the only person in class who actually enjoyed the book (and also the only one who disliked Frankenstein). I picked it up off of my shelf a few days ago (cracked binding, faded glue, and all the pages falling out) and finally reread it: I still like it. It's the story of a group of English boys trapped on a deserted island. In an attempt to be rescued, the boys being to cultivate their own civilization with structure and orders. This all to quickly falls apart. Lord of the Flies is a short masterpiece of children's lives mirroring the adult sphere and, like so many other books lodged in the annuals of high school literature, too often is read at an age when a person is most likely to lack the understanding of the full implications of the book. A splendid read."
3,An okay read...,"I read Lord of the Flies one time for school. When I first started reading it, I didn't like it that much, but I thought it wasn't too bad. Some parts were really interesting, but some were boring. I thought it really started to get my attention towards the end when a lot of interesting things started to happen, but I didn't really like the first half. If you didn't have to read this when you were in school, I would recommend giving it a try. But I suggest to read it all the way through to get the full enjoyment of it though."
3,Lord of the Flies Review,"Lord of the Flies is a story about sverel young boys who were stranded on an island with no adults. The story tells about how they developed leaders and routine for their lives. It was a well written book, although sometimes it was hard to follow. Some portions were a bit disturbing, but it kept me entertained, and that takes a lot. I'd say this book is like Peter Pan meets Cast Away. It was a wonderful story on adventure and survival."
2,Fighting for Survival,"Have you ever had to fight for your own survival? In Lord of the Flies by William Golding, a group of kids crash on a deserted island with no adult in sight. The kids choose a leader, Ralph, who fights for the survival of the group.I felt this book was slow in getting to the turning point in the plot. When I did reach that point it changed so drastically it left me puzzled. Reading this book was a chore. I struggled to keep myself interested through every chapter. The characters behaviors kept changing and it made the storyline hard to follow. I do not recommend this book to readers who crave exciting and interesting plots.-Tim Fox"
4,Disturbing Tale,"I've heard a lot about The Lord of the Flies throughout my life, but this was my first time reading it. It was surprisingly short and fast;it didn't quite live up to the hype in my mind but it was still well worth a read. It certainly can be interpreted as an allegory for the base nature of man and especially of the power of 'the mob.' Overall I thought Golding's descriptions and the way he kept the narrative moving was very effective; the characters evolved from typical schoolboys into something fierce, raw and unscrupulous. However I felt that I needed more character development and background in order to really care about these characters and therefore feel fully horrified at what happens to them."
3,Cast Away of young and Resultant Human behaviour,"When I started reading this book I was happy to look for adventure of a bunch of young kids/men stranded on an island without any support or knowledge of survival instincts. Then the story takes a turn by showing how human behavior creates anger, jealousy and hunger for control. The key of the book is how do people react when left to survive without controls, governments aka survival in nature.The writing style is smart, vivid and exceptionally detailed. The author describes every movement, colour, geography and person in detail.The plan is simple- put kids from various backgrounds in order to get a bag full of characters possible.Read this to realise how we end up behaving when there is no control and the dark side our human mind is capable off"
5,THE Boys Own Adventure,"I will first of all admit that the book is a trifle overweighted on the symbolism angle - notwithstanding, it remains a superb adventure, fable, morality tale and social examination. As for being put off by having read it at school, I can only assume that it was taught too early, or by a bad teacher - I stole my copy after the end of the school year and have been reading it ever since!"
3,"Violent and disturbing, but a mirror of our society.","I read this book as a young adult and found it to be very violent and disturbing. Now I can see how a simple story of a group of people trying to survive on the bare minimum in the wild, turn to savagedry, and how it reflects our society."
3,Golding put his talents in the wrong places...,"I thought that the themes and the symbols in this book were awesome. Very well done. If the book was only themese and symbols I'd give it a 5 star rating. Unfortunately, the book has a long way to go before I can give it even 4. My main problem with the book is that I do not like Golding's writing style. I think he put too much description in the wrong places. I also wish that Golding would have gone into more detail with Simon's character. If I didn't have to read it for school I probably would not have finished the book, but I am glad that I did. I really did enjoy the messages that the book sent."
3,lord of the flies,"I think that the aothor's purpose was to tell,thtat everyone has some evil in them.I don't agree with the author's message,because Piggy was nothing but good.The literary elemnt that the author handled the best was symbolism.I think that because he used the conch,to symbolize rulership,and he used the pig's head,to symbolize death and evil.I think this book is believable.I think it's believable,because if some boy's stay on a island by themselves,you know there's going to be trouble.The way I think the book was ""less than perfect"",was when the boy's got rescued.If I was the author I would fix these flaws by,making the rescue more exciting."
3,HMMM maybe!,"well i had to read this book for school and we went over and over and over the little details such as the metaphors and hows its a microcosm etc. I think that if you just read the book through once and then if you want to go over the tons of subtle details, this book is OK but beware of going too deeply into it! i found this book to be quite true of human nature and what humans do when left without the restraints of law and order and society. I give this 3 stars!"
3,enjoyable but somewhat dull,"I enjoyed the storyline but not the plot. You might say it was dull towards the end, but I won't reveal to you the end, if you do like these kind of books. This book just lacked something in the plot- maybe it was the characters non-involvement in the plot maybe something a bit different- but I can't put my finger on it."
2,May be a classic...but not as good as people think,"I was required to read this book for school in my Honors English Class(9th grade), I found it very hard to follow and too symbolic. This is the book of dreams for any English teacher who loves to get their students to read between the lines. Personally, I enjoy a book that is a challenging read, but in this book, every little detail meant something ""deeper"" and it gave me a headache trying to interpret the aspect of society the detail was trying to depict. I understood the book, but, it was not enjoyable for me and if it were not a required reading, I would not have read the book otherwise. But, if you like books to give you a headache, then this is perfect for you."
2,Lord of the Flies by Andy Lemmons,The book Lork of the Flies was an ok book. To me I thought there was too many stories going on at the same time and there was to many charcters that the author talked about. Yet it had good adventures I was not really thrilled about this book. If you are looking for an adventure type or survival book then this book is a good book for you.
2,Ok,"I think that the authors purpose for writing this was to send a message that there is evil in all men. I agree with him because the boys expressed it after they lost respect for eachother. They all showed some kind of evil on the island. The literary element that the author showed was symbolism. He handled it very well because it made you want to keep reading to see if his symbolism was true or not. In my opinion, this book was believable because imagine being on the for six to nine months. the boys went crazy thinking about how long they were going to survive which of course made the evil come out in them. The book was less than perfect in the ending. I probably would have had some cops investigate on why some of the boys that were dead looked the way they did. That would have been my way of changing the flaws."
2,Lord of the Flies Review,"i think the author's message of this book is very clear. He is telling about how mean, cruel, and uncaring people can be, no matter what age. I definately agree with this because of all the horrible things that are seen on the news, it's supports my theory. I think the author used characters best in the book because, in the book, from beginning to end, he analzyes and builds up every character. This is good because it lets you know who you're reading about. This book was pretty much believable, excpet for the fact that the kids were a little too young to be doing what they were doing. Which incidentely, in my opinion, is the only flaw in this book. If i were the author, i would have simply changed the kids ages by making them a couple of years older. If this was done, it would have been much better and more realistic. I would recommend this book to anyone."
3,My opinion on Lord of the Flies,"Lord of the Flies is a very enjoyable book. It is a book that you would enjoy reading if you like analyzing day-to-day life in your litature. The way Golding makes the boys on the island symbolize people and actions in the real world is what makes the book so good. I origianly thought the book was gooing to be boring and hard to catch on to but after I got into the book I wanted to know more about the characters and what was going to happen next. If you dont like putting yourself into your reading then you would not like this book. The plot in this story is always changing, because right when you thilnk something predictable is going to happen ,golding puts a spin on how they characters act or what their next action is going to be. Overall I thought Lord of the Flies is a good book."
4,A novel teenagers would love,"I personally really enjoyed this book. I believe that it would appeal more to teenager than adults, but both would like it. It has a good beginning with the kids stranded on the island. The novel is a page turner and has interesting and unexpected twists throughout it. The main suspense is wanting to know if the boys are going to be rescued. There are many instances where the novel reminds me of real life today. I would recommend this book to everyone, especially teenagers."
4,Human Nature At Its Best,"This is one fabulous book full of great themes, motifs, and symbols. Golding, although it is apparent that he really hates humanity and is a bitter man, is such a wonderful writer and makes this story come to life in more than one way. This book's reference to Christian Iconography is so great that it gives this story so much more depth. His symbols are also one thing that show us what human nature is really about and how it actually is.This book is about a group of choir boys that get stranded on an island during a war. They try to establish rule and order but eventually find themselves trying very hard just to stay alive while their hope for being rescued is floating off on the horizon. With all the adventures that show us what humanity is really like, this is one read that everyone should enjoy."
2,Lord of the flies,"William Golding wrote a good book contrasting two types of war. Boys are stranded on an island after a plane crash. They are challenged to face a number of opsticals, including death. The time set is during WWII."
2,A book I wasen't really to thrilled of finishing.,"This was A book of choice I had chose for a book report in my histoy class. As I read the first couple chapters, I'm sorry to say that it was missing something....I didn't really get into it. The plot and descripton of things were kind of boring to me. But I did however, like the description of the platform, with the green water and reflection on the plam leaves. But They way he described the kids,i don't know their faces, and that whole skinny dipping scene and that they're all boys on the island- the way he kept descripbeing them, every detail of there looks- sounded kind of quer to me.--I'm sorry, no offense. Well anyway, this book was okay, but I think I should have stuck to my original book choice, won't say the name because it dosen't really matter. Wel'p that concludes my review. so long."
2,Hello from Canada,"""Lord of the flies""The book in the beginning was interesting but when i reached the part when they go after ralph and piggy and try to get them,that's what i didn't undrstand. How could 13 or 14 years old kidstry to kill each other,and don't care.The book after all was not bad,it lets u read it even if your not interested. I like the way golding flies us from on idea to the another.for me i give it 2 stars"
3,Interesting,"I read this book last year for school, I thought it was really interesting. It had excitement, adventure, and more. I think that it is great summer reading, especially if you like those reality TV shows, because it somewhat reminds you of those."
5,Just a school book? I dont think so!,"I am 14 years old and loved this book. I have read many books and liked and hates some. But this book I loved!! When my friends and family told me about it it made me sick to think of KIDS killing each other. Once I read it I loved it. Golding really understood that kids will only want to have fun. I recomend this to anyone who likes to read and to anyone over 13 years old. Most teenagers thought it was stupied, but you got to remeber that, that is how life is, there is good and bad people, most peoples like the bad people because they make life seem easyer. If you put kids on a island they would do what happens in the book. Any thing to say to me you can e-mail me at angel73339@hotmail.com I love to hear what people have to say."
5,School student gives Thumbs up,"It is evident that many high school students do not appreciate the artistry and terrible truths that Golding has demonstrated in this Ballatyne novel. I, for one, a normal 13 year old, highly recommend this book for all readers. The story line is intricately weaved together to form a tragic, provocative, yet beautifully written novel. The story revolves around a a group of marooned English schoolboys. It follows their struggle to maintain order and it allows the reader to reflect on the state of man kind. I am a school student and give this compelling novel and thumbs up! Buy this book and you too will be spellbound by one of the most celebrated of all modern novels."
4,good book,"This bok had strong characters and surprising changes. For instance, Jack is a calm, well behaved choir boy until he crosses that line between sanity and insanity. He starts killing creatures, both animal and human, and drags everyone with him, convincing them that this is the right thing to do."
4,It was a good book and also intersting,"If I had to choose between the book and the movie, I'd choose the book. This book was a little bit difficult for me, becauce of the details and the feelings. But I liked the conversation between the characters and I also liked that the book was very dynamic.I recommend this book to anybody who likes to read. I think this is a good novel ""Lord Of The Flies"" because it makes you think about how the world is working now."
3,Its not so bad!!!!!,This novel isn't so bad. The author William Golding has a unique way of expessing the feelings of the characters(In this novel the principal character is Ralph). I think he expresses the reality of todays little kids that are on the streets and become savage.
3,Lord Of The Flies,"Golding's purpose for writing Lord Of The Flies was to show mankind at its worst and how human nature can go wrong. Golding's message was that there is evil inside of us all. Golding is correct in this manner but I thing that everyone has good in them, too. In Golding's Lord of the Flies he handled the characters the best. The characters were all well developed and each one represented a different aspect of human nature: Ralph was leadership, Piggy was intelligence , Simon was spirituality , Jack was dictatorship , Roger was evil and Samneric represented the fact that everyone needs someone to help them function. Lord of the Flies was a little unbelievable in the plot aspect of the book. Twelve year olds wouldn't believe in democracy. Also the whole island seemed kind of unreal and fake like it was just a backdrop. I think the plot was less than perfect and could have been developed a little more. All in all, I would give this book 3 stars."
4,lord of the flies-book review,I think that Golding was trying to tell his readers that there is a need for rules and civilization.I agree with Golding because if there were no rules or guidelines to abide by then people would go crazy and we would end up in total chaos.I think Golding's best literary element in Lord of the Flies was his characters he created. Each person was very different from each other. I think it could be believable because without a set of rules or regulations people would act the way the boy's acted in the book.I think the book was fine.I just would've changed some of the beginning so it wouldn't drag as much as it did.
4,The book was good,"The author wanted to show you the lost of innocence. I agree with the author because the boys were so innocent in the beginning but as time goes bye that soon changes. The author best handled symbolism. For example, the conch represented authority and Piggy's glasses represented nearsightedness. These symbols helped me understand the book. The book wasn't believable because I don't think that a bunch of boys ranging from the ages of 5 and 13 can really survive on an island all by themselves. I think the author shouldn't have Piggy and Simon die in such a cruel way. If I had a choice I would've let them live and I would've had Ralph and Jack become friends again.Overall, I thought the book was good."
4,The review,"The sequence of events throughout the story were very well designed through the way of Golding's description abilities. Sure, sometimes it does become annoying and you lose your place a lot, or you can't understand what's going on or who's doing what. Yet, it was still good. The book was, though, within the greater whole, a well written believeable piece. Some of what happened could happen and some of if really isn't that believable. Yet, with how well Golding described it as if he was actually seeing it, that helped get the effect of it being real. Also, none of us really know what would happen if we got stranded on an island. So we don't know how true or untrue the whole actions of the situation are. Some people might agree or not with what all I have said, because everyone interprets things differently, but this is what I think"
4,Lord of the Flies,"I really enjoyed William Goldings novel Lord of the Flies. It was adventurous, tragic, and very convincing. If you like novels that start off shaky with a high climax and end not happy but not sad you'll love Lord of the Flies."
3,"Expresses the realities of war, island is microcosm of war","This book shows people what happens when you face the realities of war. Fear,hope, and courage are all spliced into one which is something that you don't often see in one book. This book shows people how children's fears lead them to fighting. The more they fight the farther and farther they feel from home."
3,"Lord of the Flies is a confusing novel, but worth reading.","William Golding's novel, Lord of the Flies was an intresting novel. At first, it took much time to figure out the symbolism Golding was expressing. In the beginning it was extremely hard to for me to follow. I found myself quite dumbfounded at times when their were hidden meanings behind the plot. Without my teachers explanation I wouldn't have been able to get through the novel and understand it like I should. I enjoyed the characters, the each came to life by Golding's description's, and their actions and behavior. I thought it was intresting, that a ""beastie"" can be imaginary, and hidden inside one's self. However, even though I was complexed, when reading the novel's resolution it clicked, and I was at once understanding the book. I am enamoured by the novel's theme; at any age, their is always a seed of evil inside of you."
2,It was not the greatest book,We did not think that the book was very good because up unitl the last few chapters it was soooooooo boring. It took a while for the book to get interesting. It was very disturbing to see 11 and 12 year old boys wanting to kill each other and hurt each other. We liked how there was a lot of symbolism in the book and how it related to what was going on in the time period in which the book took place.
2,"Lord of the Flies was creative, but lost our attention.","We think that the book, Lord of the Flies, was just 'ok'. It was an intense way of looking at a goodlife. We believe that the message of the novel was always have hope. We thought it could have ended better, but it pulled it all together well. Although we were bored at times, we liked the way Golding had items symbolize ideas. The book was different then ones we have read in the past, therefore, it broadened our views of good versus evil."
3,I think The Lord of the Flies was mostly boring.,The most interesting parts in the book were when the boys saw the parachutist on top of the mountain and thought he was a monster. The other most interesting part was when Simon was 'talking' to the Lord of the Flies. I think the ending would have been more exciting if Jack or Ralph had been killed.
2,Lord of the Flies is about the animalistic side of everyone,"This is not a book that is for somebody who plans on being a dedicated reader. It is not a book that is easily accessable. It was hard to understand the symbolism and hidden features. It was hard to grasp some of the themes. However the message in the book is and important one to learn. It shows us that no matter how young, or old you may be you still have that seed of evil hidden inside of you."
4,lord of the flies was ok.,"This book was ok. I must admit that i was really bored at the beginning. It became more interesting towards the end of the book. When I finally finished reading this book I was disappointed because I thought it will be better, but after I understood the real meaning behind the book it became clear to me that it's a good book after all. This book has a lot of moral but it takes time to like it."
5,One of the best books I have ever read!!,"What can I say? I LOVED this book!! I read it in my own free time and not for school, perhaps that is why I liked it. But I also found the story line gripping and Golding's style of writing with his descriptions excellent! It seems to be the sort of book that you either hate or like, and I'm sorry that there are people out there who, unlike me, thought the book was awful."
3,"Interesting, but could've been better","I thought this book was interesting enough to want to finish it, but it had some room for improvement. The ending was pretty good - if you could understand it. Everyone who said that it was a dumb ending just didn't understand what the author was trying to convey. It was a good way to portray a group of boys who are stranded on an island woth no adult supervision. I'd recommend this book to people in the age group of 12-16."
4,A chillingly good read.,"Lord of the Flies is one of the most detailed and graphically depictive books,as it explores the extreme darkness of the human soul and asks the most common question:""How far will one go to survive?"" One of the downsides of this book is that some of the dialogue is confusing and,someties,is annoying. Some of the events,such as the pig hunts,are very descriptive and thought provoking,it makes you feel as though you are there. This book is hard to judge as the quality over all is a little inconsistent,but the book is still enjoyable.And by the don't listen to that ""Venezuelan reader""guy,he dosen't even speak correct english."
3,Lord of the Flies was a OK book.,"The book was poorly written. The best writing can be found only in the segments discussing the scenery. I thought the idea of the book was great but some of the analagies made are somewhat unrealistic. Although people do become crazy (especially 12 year-old boys) the characters in the novel were extremes of each stereotype. Ralph was far too angry and it is realitively unrealistic to find an utter satist like Roger, going to a private catholic school. I thought the best part of the book was the symbolism. The book is reasonably OK but extremely overated. If anyone is interested in a female and more racy version of the same sort of book I recomend ""John Dollar""."
1,Worst required reading EVER!,"This is required reading in 9th grade. While there are quite a few lessons one can learn from it, storywise it is the worst book I've ever read (and the movie is not any better)!!"
3,complete recording of a tedious novel,"Listening to this novel doesn't improve it. You get the added bonus track of Golding groaning on and on and on about how he got the inspiration for this overly simplistic morality tale. With so much good literature out in the world, if the house catches fire, leave this one behind. Sucks to my as-mar."
3,Lord of the Flies,"In this book a bunch of English boy's plane crashes leaving them on a deserted island with no adults, just eachother. They split into two groups. But there is one boy named Piggy who trys to keep the group together and is basically the only boy who trys to help everyone. To find out what happens to them in the end read this lovely book."
3,Ugh,"Golding's implication that ""painted niggers"" and ""savages"" represent the darkest aspect of human nature reeks of the worst imaginings during the European colonial days. I'm giving the book 3 stars because it was decently written and well characterized (Golding's got a good handle on infant behaviour), but I cannot stand the message."
2,A thematic novel whose theme is not well presented,"I read a lot of novels for entertainment purposes, but I'll start off by saying that those I read for school I usually like less then those I read on my own. It is possible I am biased. This novel seems to invite overanalyzation in the worst way. The flimsiest throwaway line can be sought out and examined for meaning. These meanings often reflect only what the reader wanted to see. I think Golding was trying to make a point and did a passable job at doing it. I think he lacks subtlety, however. The books that carry the most weight in my mind are those which do so in a manner you hardly notice, but at every turn Lord of the Flies screams out, ""there is an innate evil in humans!"" Its ending seems contrived and somewhere along the line it acquires a nightmarish quality that seems to me to detract from the theme."
4,Not your ordinary love story...,"If you are looking for a heartwarming sappy love story, then...this is not your type of book. Lord of the Flies by William Golding is a book filled with deceit, insanity, and teenage boys trying to survive a deserted island. These civilized boarding school boys are sole survivors of a plane crash. The book takes place during a raging war which is like the atmosphere that accumulates on the island. These once proper boys turn into crazed maniacs after being away from society, adults, and rules.This book may be defined as good literature. If I were to list some of the interesting parts of the book, then I would ruin a rainy day reading! I know that there are questions running through your mind right now, like: ""Did all the boys survive?"" ""Did they get rescued?"" and ""How did they react to each other on the island?"" Well, there is only one way to find out which is to go read the book yourself!"
5,"Poetic, Powerful, Authentic writing","Not only does this book deserve 5 stars, but it is books like this one that should be the criteria for awarding 5 stars. When I read a book, if it doesn't move me like The Lord of the Flies, I hesitate to give more than 4 stars. However, after reading Golding's novel, I rushed to award top marks. An airplane full of English schoolboys has crash-landed on a deserted island. As their condition detiorates, loyalties and protocols begin to crumble and the animalistic side of human nature emerges within the group. As I stated in the title of this review, the writing is authentic. You won't find the string of cliches like you see with other authors. The story is beautiful and terrifying at the same time. One wishes for 200 more pages as the story climaxes with page-turning exitement. Golding's use of symbolism is genius. This book is on my ""must reads of a lifetime"" list. Put it on yours."
2,Sorry to say...,"I am sorry to say but this has to be one of the worst books I have ever read in my life. First off whatever plot was meant was basically pointless, in fact the plot was basically non existant. The writing was focused on what the author thought probable, however this probability is highly unlikely. I would never actually want to read the book again."
4,book.....,"This is a classic book that I think everyone should read. I read it for my 9th grade class and it was pretty interesting. The book arrived in good condition, in fact, it looked like, brand new."
5,Shocking,"I loved this book. It explores social interactions between young males, and the limits of the conscience. The ending was shocking... be prepared for an exciting story! (This is middle school reading)"
3,Good but not great,"The main thing that people rave about this book is its SYMBOLISM. Well, I think that symbolism is based on your own opinion. We don't know that the author meant to have this particular thing represent this particular idea. When you get to the story itself, the first four chapters and the last four chapters are worth a read. However, everything in between I found to be very boring and you find yourself having to stop and re-read certain things because you forget what is happening; there is no action to help keep you up to speed.Just FYI, I didn't have to read this book for school. I read it in my spare time. From what I understand, those who must read it for school have a far lower opinion of this novel, but I don't know that for a fact."
4,Surviving without adults,"This book really teaches you something. When the boys were living without the rules of adults, they tried to make their own rules but as always, there was someone who did not agree with them. Ralph was the one who wanted to make the group follow the rules in order to keep order and Jack was the one who did not care about the rules and wanted to do his own thing. The constrast between these two boys tell us the differences between the norms within a society and animal behavior."
4,A compelling tale,"This is a story about mankind's inherent brutality. I read this book in 1992 when I was in Grade 11. (Not because I had to, I should add.) I saw the 1963 film first and this made me read the book. A group of English schoolboys trapped on an island slowly turn into a horde of savages. Part of the reason I read this book was in case it did become set reading for our English class. It turned out to be an unnecessary exercise but I enjoyed the book anyway. I actually envied the kids who had to read it the following year for English. Listening to them complain that it's boring or that they didn't understand it. (My class read ""1984"", another book I can recommend.) Avoid seeing the woeful 1990 film version of the novel. Most of the original story is blatantly missing."
4,Dark side,Know the human descendant off civilisation when left on his own. Didn't like the movie though.
4,Testing Human Strength!,"This book goes into the troubles of young children trying to survive in an unknown world. As they're faced with the tasks of making shelters, and finding food they learn another problem. What if they aren't alone? This book truly tests the capabilities of children and what they can handle when alone. It forces them to learn how to fend for themselves in the scary world of today.Although I usually don't enjoy adventure or action books a lot like this type of book, I really enjoyed it. The language in which the book is written captivates the reader, and draws you into the story line. I could never stop imagining that I was one of those children faced with the troubles that they were faced with. I highly recommend this book."
4,An interesting book,"This was a very good novel, the author William Golding expresses the feelings of the characters very well. It makes you realize how life really is, that there is evil inside of every one. I would recommend this book to anyone who actually likes to read, I believe that people who read it will like it, like me."
2,Not the best book I have ever read,I just finished reading this book in English class and I must say it was not all that great. I thought that the boys were acting crazy. I don't picture this ever happening in real life. I would rather read something else! I'm glad I finally finished it!
4,A very chilling tale.,"I found the novel to be a chilling look into what people would come to with out a society. Without rules or people to enforce the rules more so, young British schoolboys turn savage."
3,It was an o.k book and very well written.,The book is really not my style but i can not think of any other way to change it to make it any better. I think the author's purpose of writing this book is to show how sometimes humans can be dark and ruthless and how one can have so much influence on another. I agree with the author because it is true in our every day world.
3,IT WAS OK.,I think that the Lord of the Flies was a pretty good book. It had a boring begining but the ending was full of action and conflict that kept you glued to the pages. The characters were pretty realistic and related to the people of today.
5,SPELLBINDING,"I'll make this short, because there's lots more 5 star reviews to be read! The Lord of the Flies is simply amazing! The way the boys turn to savages presents a chilling reality of the human race. Read it. Now."
1,Very boring and hard to follow.,This book was not very interesting at all. Maybe if he talked about more than a couple of things it might just be interesting.
1,I did not understand this book!,"I hated it, it was soo confusing. I had to read it in 5th grade and no one understood it at all."
2,lord of the flies,I think that the book was boring till the last two chapters then it started to pick up a little and get interesting.I think the book was slow moving and drawn out in alot of the chapters and the kids needed to get a difffrent method of talking and leader ship because the book was getting drawn out with all of the fighting and complanig kids would do it started to hurt your head.The worst part of the book was the ending because it ended with the kids getting rescued and they started to cry like wimps after they all ready killed two kids. The best part was when the kids were getting killed then the story started to pick up a little but then it got dumb after the rampage stoped. Thats why this gets a rating of two.
4,High School,"Many of us were forced to read this novel in High School English class. I am glad I had to read this book, it made me think, but I remember it being gruesome as well!!"
3,not that good,all most everyone says that this is one of the best books ever written.i disagree completely.the book is about a group of young kids who are stranded on an island after the plane they are on crashes.the kids survive by making their own rules and selecting a leader among themselves.the boys want to be the leader and they soon become enemies.its not that great like a lot of people claim.thats my opinion.
1,Waste of Time,"I was asked to read this book, and I thought the title was interesting. Well, I was wrong. The only good part was the last chapter!!! Here is a basic synopsis of the book: A bunch of boys are stranded on an Island. They know how they got there, an airplane. None of them know each other (unless they went to school with others), yet they were all on the same plane. The pilot did not survive. Some of the boys become obssessed with killing while others are obssessed with being rescued. Kids die and a few turn cannibalistic. I won' t tell you the end, but there is absolutely no point in reading this book unless you like being bored out of your mind when reading. By the way, the title has relatively nothing to do with the book."
1,What was Golding thinking?,"Until Lord of the Flies I had NEVER left a book unfinished. Flies was excruciatingly dull, and uses way too much advanced vocabulary making it impossible to understand. The plot was horrible, and the characters under developed. I had trouble keeping the characters straight. They just seemed to blend together and had no distinct personality. I pity anyone sucked into reading this. It was one of the worth things I have ever read and I absolutely despise it. I would just like to know what the heck Golding was thinking when he wrote this! If it was possible I would have given this book a negative ten. A one is much too high for such a poor excuse for literature."
4,Needed for school,Well I was very happy with the exactness of the text of the book just wasn't happy with the page numbers it gave me because I needed page numbers for quotes in the book for an essay I ended up using a friend's book have the page numbers next time for people like me
4,Favorite book I've read this year,"I had to read this book for my freshmen English class. After reading all the reviews,I noticed people kept calling the book 'evil'. They've missed the point. The book is about the raw evil of mankind. I love survival books as well and this was right up my alley. I would not reccomend abyone under 12 reading it. Ermm the reason I did not give it all five stars is simply because it ended so abrutly. I could go for some sort of explaining as to whhat happens next. Well thats it. thanks William Golding for giving me the opportunity to read this book"
4,Hmmmm........,"A terrifying variation on the traditional boys' adventure story. The book give insight on the duality of human nature - the divide between order and chaos, intellect and instinct, structure and savagery. But however chillingly frigtening Golding's depiction of the dark side of human nature doesnt come across as shocking due to his masterful use of symbolism and foreshadowing. While there's no promise that it'll be enjoable for some readers, it's guaranteed to be unforgettable, which is why i guess, it remains a cult favourite."
3,Nice book,It has a slow build up at the end it was a good book. to me it has a little to much detail but all in all pretty good.
3,A confusing yet interesting tale...,"The astounding vocabulary is cool at first, but after a while it gets confusing! I wouldn't recommend this book to an average reader... But as for me...Good, confusing, but a little dull in some parts... But then again I've never been a fan of this kind of genre, a friend recommended it. If you don't like adventurous tales, I don't suggest this book to you."
4,Hmmm...,"This isn't really a book you LOVE, but it's really interesting think about. I would read this with ""The Catcher in the Rye,"" since they were both written around the same time, and see who you agree with--Golding or Salinger. Both are short reads, too, which is always a bonus!"
2,The Lord of the Flies,"I thought that the Lord of the Flies had a really good theme, about the beast within us all. However, the way it was brought across to the reader was kind of wordy and confusing. But, the storyline behind it I thought was good.All in all it was an okay book to read."
4,Lord of The Flies Review,"I thought this book was very interesting in many ways. It really opened my eyes to the evil nature of human beings, and how, if we let it, that evil nature will come out. When they first land on the island, the boys are all dressed in a uniform, and they are proper, as their upbringing would cause them to be. There is, however, a huge difference in their appearance and attitudes at the end of the novel. All of the boys are dressed up like savages, with paint on their bodies. None of them care at all about rules or regulations or what is right or wrong. That shows just how easily humans can turn from good to evil. I enjoyed reading Lord of The Flies because there was usually never a dull moment. In every chapter, there was always something new developing. This was a very good book."
1,Horrible !,"I had to read this book in my English class and it was horrible. It was bloody, depressing, and absolutly vile. I found my self cringe when I thought about reading it. If you have a tough time thinking back on your high school day because people were descriminating to you because of the way you looked or acted, this book will re-open those painfull scars. Nobody should ever recommend this book because it's so depressing and wretched."
1,Disturbed,"While this book was well written and created vivid pictures, I was disturbed by the the theme of this story. It was extremely odd and disgusting. After hearing that this book has recieved high ratings, I was very dissapointed with the warped ideas Golding used to express ""human nature"". I do not reccomend this book."
1,They made us read it,"I first read this book 30 years ago for a high school English class. I found it to be horrible. I recently read it a second time when my daughter read it for her English class. A thing of art may be a thing of beauty, but this book is a perpetual piece of trash! My daughter who has read hundreds of books says it is the second worst book she has ever read. English teachers please take note - this is not wine that gets better with age. It is more like stale beer."
1,"Well written , but disturbing!",The purpose of this book was to reveal the loss of innocence. Lord of The Flies was well written and very descriptive. I hated reading this book with a passion. I personally wouldn't recommend this book to anyone because it is disturbing.I guess there are certain types of people who like to read books like this and I'm not one of them.
1,"""Lord of the Flies"" Sinks","This is the only book I've ever read that I actively dislike. I'd be tempted to say that it's an accursed book. The imagery is somewhat confusing and, when worked out, sometimes means the opposite of what I think it should mean. There is some semblance of a plot, but it does not follow a clear story line. The thoughts behind the book are garbled, the language often muddy, and one has the feeling that if there had been just one female on the island of whatever age, none of the events would have happened. These were not the actions of boys. It was not a representation of society. It butchered my mind as surely as the schoolboys butchered each other."
5,Fire on the Island . . .,"Well, most people in America have already read ""Lord of the Flies"" by William Golding, which is definitely a classic. So I'm not going to give a synopsis, just a general appraisal of the work.The main characters (Ralph, Jack, Piggy, Roger, and many more) are very complex and very riveting. You can clearly observe their distinctive personalities with their actions and their dialogue. And you feel sorry for these characters when something goes horribly wrong.There are many symbolisms in this book (the conch, the pigs, the flies, etc.), and they work very well here. Interpretations are open (except when it comes to the obvious ones). Tensions are high as we slowly move towards the climax. No Hollywood ending here.Golding has created an influential work of art, as highlights in this book are many. This isn't an innocent story, and it's no cliché, either. Kudos to the author.A+"
4,More interesting at the end,"This book is a little slow at the beginning, but if you keep reading it gets very intersting. Even if you don't get all the symbolism in it, the story is still exciting even if it is depressing. Although I don't think they needed to describe the bloody pig hunt in as much detail. Give this book a try if you like adventure or symbolism."
5,An excellent peice of literature!,"I think that the author believes in original sin, because it portraits this in the book. This book has lots of themes, and I think that it also shows the loss of innocence. The author Mr. Golding described the setting so detaield, that you could watch a movie in your head. Each character represents a meaning. For example, Piggy's glasses represent clear-sightedness and intelligence. An MUST READ book! Not boring at all!"
4,Not Meant For Young Children,"I found this listed when I searched for children's books for 4 - 8 year olds, showing up with things like Good Night Moon. I would not want to discourage anyone from reading this book, because the story is classic, but I simply think it's worth mentioning for any parents who might not know: this is NOT something to read to your 4 year old. As mentioned in other reviews, it is very dark and possibly upsetting. Animal Farm, which comes up along with this is also a wonderful book that is better read in Junior High than First grade."
3,Unfulfilling...,"On completion of reading this book I felt that it was unfinished. I went through so much struggle with these young boys only to have someone come save them from themselves. I felt that this book promoted a socialistic ideas; portraying the metaphor that humans cannot rule themselves, they need the government (or in this case, adults) to come save them. What a disapointment! I found Lord of the Flies to be extremely irritating to read. I might have to read it again when I'm older like others have recommended. This book is worth reading, but be ready to have the hair on the back of your neck stand up!"
4,"It was complicated, but it was pretty good","The main reason why I didn't like this book too much was because I couldn't relate the way that the people lived. The lesson that I got from this book was that real friendships are hard to come by. Real friends are those who cares and treats you for the real you. Even though real friendships are hard to come by, there will be one of them for at least one time of your life. Don't throw that away. After reading this book, I feel lucky for the friends that I have because not everybody will have the same luck that I have had of having them."
4,A great fable,"I read this novel a long time ago in its Russiantranslation (a reasonably good one), but it goeswithout saying that the original is vastly superior to any translation.The entire novel is symbolist - from the very firstsentence to the very last, and in this symbolism lie both its strength and its greatest weakness. The problem is: it is *too* neatly symbolic, all symbols fit too perfectly into the author's preconceptions. This book is definitely a fable (as opposed to fiction), but for a fable it is a very good one."
2,Hard To Follow!,"I had to read this book in my 9th Grade English Honors class, and couldn't wait to get it over with! It used terminology that was hard to understand and I never actually understood what was going on until we went over it as a class, and even then I still had trouble! Now, for summer reading I am having to read To Kill a Mockingbird and it is pretty good! Not even comparible to Lord of the Flies! To sum it up in one word, YUCK!!!"
3,"Good Plot, But Not An Easy Read","I read some of this book in high school, but read it in its entirety recently to see how I felt about it as a 32-year-old adult. I enjoyed it somewhat.It is a good plot concept in general, with lots of opportunity for analysis and psychological scrutiny. However, oftentimes I had a difficult time believing that the characters were children, because they seemed to behave a little too adult for their age. The writing was a bit verbose for my tastes, although not excessively so. Because of this, it didn't suck me into it's world entirely, and it wasn't something that I was very enthusiastic about finishing, except to find out how it ends.Overall, this is worth reading if you have any curiosity about it, but it may take some determination to get through it."
5,One of my all time favorites,"It doesn't get much better than this. I just read this book for the 4th time and still get chills at the end. True to human nature, Golding has tapped into his youth and the selfish and brutal nature of a society that fails to speak up and defend its weaker parts. One of the best examples of the birth of a dictatorship. Loved it."
4,love this book,this is a great book that shows the fallacies of human nature. i really enjoyed it and it has a great ending. everyone should read thsi book
4,Detail-exiting; That's Lord of the Flies,This book was one of the most facinating books i have read. I like the descriptive writing that Golding uses. He gives each character a different personality and he shows it. This was probably the best book I've read. If you like long and adventurous books than this is the one for you.
4,A weird beginning with a weird ending,"I was forced to read this book in my 10th grade English class. I read the first chapter and knew I wasn't going to like the rest of the book. Lord of the Flies, by William Golding, has a very very deep side to it beyond just the story. I found it to be a very easy read once I got past the first few chapters. If you are struggling, please continue to read. It gets better as you go."
2,I did not enjoy it at all,"I had to read this book for class I'm taking in the fall. Because this was required reading, I expected to be blown away by the story. Unfortuantely I wasn't. I thought the messages he was trying to convey were indeed, profound, but I was not at all moved. It did not bring out any emotions in me at all while reading it."
4,A true classic,"I have to admit when I first picked this book up and read through the first 2 chapters or so I was extremely turned off by the British writing style of Mr. Golding and his peculiar sentence structure at times. However, as I explored this novel further I became more comfortable with the style and learned to appreciate everything this book has to say. The theme of basic human nature leading to the destruction of a society is illustrated very strongly in this novel, and I like how the author presented this. Despite the fact that all the characters are children, Golding has managed to create strong and interesting characters that paralllel many people in politics we see today. A worthy read and an instant classic, the only reason for the 4 stars is that some people may not appreciate Mr. Golding's writing style."
5,extremely interesting,"This book is quite interesting and does indeed depict society to a great extent. its point to the fact that given a small population isolated form external influences will bring out the primeval and basic instinct with which we are all born...in other words we revert to forming our own society, based on our so called strength at the time aka aggression. In ""polite"" society today this is largely masked and the aggressor does not literally kill the weak, but subdues, dominate etc by economic power."
4,lord of the flies,The book is very good. It is really realistic. Tells of survival and what happens when the worse comes.
5,the what ol' days?,"I cannot say enough about this book. There is so much depth in it and so much ot think about. There's more than just an innocence lost thing in it -like the choir leader, Jack, becoming the most evil on the island. I think Golding meant to imply that innocence is an illusion, as shallow as the choir boys' outfits. Being a substitute teacher for both high school and middle school, I would vouch Golding's implications hold true even for kids who aren't lost on desserted islands. Ultimately, the island signifies a pre-adolescent's experience, as being cut off from the world while admist a wild sway of new emotions. I'm glad this book exists, because peopel need access to eloquent articulation of youth's experiences."
2,I hated it,"I saw the movie and read the book. I thought it was realistic but horrible. It is gruesome, and the details of the killings are unnecessary. I rated 2 stars because it was a realalistic and made good conversation in my religion class. Send your comments of my review to my email please."
3,Let's rob a bank,"A crew of low level con-artists and criminals decide that to rob the Capitalist and Immigrant's Trust Bank they need to steal not only the money but the bank itself. The bank is housed in a temporary trailer and the robbers and one ex FBI agent cook up a scheme to remove the bank from its moorings and hide the bank in plain sight while cracking the safe.Madcap craziness ensues as the group tows the bank all over Long Island. The local cops are all portrayed as Keystone cops while the bank is rolled past them, around them and right in front of them while the perps take the bank's money.A light comedic read!"
2,Gets old quick,"Dortmunder stories are amusing, but this one would best be served by being a short story rather than the short novel tht it is. The premise of stealing a bank, temporarily located in a mobile home trailer while construction of a new facility is going on is certainly entertaining and humorous, the book even in its compact form drags on. If you love the antics of Dortmunder and his cohorts, you will probably like this as it follows the same formula as others. However, if you are looking for a humorous story that is more than absurdity then pass on this one."
4,"Good, but a tad plain","I really had no complaints about this set when I bought it on an impulse: I knew Rousset's name from his role as baroque opera conductor, and I figured I couldn't go wrong.His Goldberg Variations are very good...but he takes twice as long as Gould. On the other hand, I hardly noticed because I enjoyed them so much. The other works seem a little stiff, either from interpretation, or just because they aren't supposed to be Bach's most passionate. Either way, if you appreciate Bach + Harpsichord, I can't imagine you would have too much objection over this four-disc set."
5,A Lost CCM CLassic,"One of Glad's early recordings before they became an acappella unit. I did not recognize it at first due to the change in cover artwork (my old LP had the band in front of an old juke-box but without the green border. Superb songwriting, musicianship and vocal harmonies are what's in store on this excellent recording of diverse tunes assembled in a attention-holding mix.. The music style blends rock, jazz and pop styles effectively. This disc should be re-issued if it hasn't already, but then the CCM record industry seems reluctant to do so with many if not most of the early to mid-era classics. Get it when you find it!"
1,This Isn't The John York,"I haven't actually listened to this CD. But, this is not the John York who played with The Byrds from 1968 to 1969. This John York CD has been linked to this along with a book on The Byrds. It's a different guy. Just thought you should know."
2,A Very Difficult Read,This was a tough one. It felt as though the author was on a mission to use every word in the dictionary only once. People just don't speak this way. It took me less time to read Atlas Shrugged.
1,briliant,This is probbably the best book i have ever read.it starts of good and gets better.it keeps geting better and the end is the best bit.if i had not read this book i would read it again.there are so many good bits.
5,brilliant,as 2 A-level students who were not at all interested about history or the second world war we were made to read this novel. It's the best novel we've ever read and laughed and cried throughout it. We either loved or hated each of the charecters and were drawn into their lives. We realised the sadness of living in war times. However we felt the brutal beating of the pine martin Psipsina was unnecessary. We also found it disrespectful when a stray cat was given the same name.
1,The worst book I have ever had the misfortune to read,"This book starts badly and gets progressively worse. By the time I had finished this ""book""(!), I just felt compelled to register my disgust throughout the world. I really do not see what all of the fuss is about. It is just too farfetched, I mean, all the book is, is ""Romeo and Juliet"" set in the backdrop of some God-forsaken island that no-one has heard of. In closing, I would just like to say that I think that this book should be ""nitrogenated"" over, as Dr Iannis so succinctly puts it."
4,"Enjoyable read, but runs out of steam toward the end","This is an excellent book overall, but I felt the author rushed the last 100 pages or so. They are simply not up to the standard set by the rest of the book. Maybe an editor wrote them? It struck me that somebody said ""OK you've got 80-100 pages left, so wrap it up Louis"" ...so it ended up a bit flat. However, the first 400 or so pages had everything and I can't remember the last time I enjoyed a book so much up to that point."
5,A great book which will turn you inside out...,"This is a great book with strong characters and a riveting story which evokes thought about life's rich, historical context. The characters are so real and well-developed they seem like you truly know them. Some are lovable, some are charming, and some may be detestable, but all are unique and interesting. The story is fascinating... set in a small village on a greek island where the reader experiences the village's sleepy existence, its turbelent military occupation, and the outcome of those (and other) events. The history of the island and characters evoke thought about life's rich, historical context. It shows how history shapes nations and races and how personal experiences shape individuals. Importantly, it also illustrates how each individual plays an important role in defining both the present and influencing the future."
4,Rich prose with a historic mediterranean backdrop,"Romance, history and beautiful language this novel has it all. The characters are well developed snd grow with the story. Tragedy and pathos are interwoven in a rich bold tale which updates the Romeo and Juliet theme. None the less, even though the first chapter is linguistically challenging, through gentle perserverance a glorious story evolves. A must buy."
5,I Loved It!!!!!,"This was the best book that I have ever read. After having read it, I couldn't stop thinking about the characters lost and all those years of seperation between 'Barbara C'relli' and his 'kotitsi'. Pelagias life really made me come face to face with reality and sometimes I wondered 'why couldn't things just stay the way they were?' Unlike Louis de Bernieres, I really can't find the right words to express my feelings about this book; sometimes I think back to it and cry whilst other times I remember the more humourus stages such as Stamatis and Kokolios, psipsina, Iannis and the priest (but then I come to remembering that they were all lost lives and I get depressed again). A beautifull story! I'm going to read it over and over again but this time, I'll leave out the last few pages and try to pretend that those events didn't occur."
3,"a great, informative read -- but again, oy, that ending!","This book definitely does live up to a great deal of its hype - it is moving, funny, very human and certainly gave me a real insight into the lives and tragedies of `ordinary' civilians during the Second World War. But ... did anyone else have trouble with his women characters? I know a lot of people were displeased with the ending (me too; I think Corelli should have come back sooner or not at all -- as someone says earlier, the last 80 pages are fairly dire -- but even early on in the book, the way Pelagia dumps Mandras because he comes back all skanky - are we supposed to be on her side? And isn't it a disappointment that after Pelagia raises `her' Antonia to be such a free thinking independent woman she winds up some bourgeouis, seemingly empty-headed trophy wife? I had a REALLY hard time with the women in this book, I'm afraid. Still, it feels like nit-picking when, honestly, overall, I'd recommend it very highly."
3,Valued,"Nicely made to protect your Garmin from dust, water, or so and made from good material too with extra cushions in case your Garmin falls, however it would be nice if it covered the whole thing."
3,It works but costly piece of plastic,"Fits perfectly, but just a piece of plastic that will blow off if you have it on a motorcycle. A simple sock will work better and cost less. But, it is a good Garmin product that fits."
1,Bad size,Garmin GPS coverDon't make my error and assume this cover will fit the popular Nuvi series-there are none.
1,Disappointing: Outdated and Not Useful,"This book was written in 1987! Technically speaking, it's completely out of date.My major criticism, though, is the low value of the content. Do we really need to be taught that soft or pastel colors appeal more to women? Not only is that kind of thinking outdated, but who needs to read a book with that level of ""information""?"
4,Great Album,I really liked this album and still do but as a lot the music has been lifted directly from the 'music box theme' from the movie 'The Innocents' I am kind off dissapointed. It has also ruined my viewing of the movie as I just hear Current 93 whenever I watch it :(.
2,Current 93 'unplugged',"I used to buy every Current 93 record when they came out but after this I don't. It's ok as an album, but if you don't care for their stripped down and under-produced acoustic guitar and piano leanings, this isn't their best work by far. If you like the folkish Current 93, stick with Thunder Perfect Mind. If you like the noisy Nature Unveiled style, steer clear."
5,Absolutely Beautiful,"My Wife, Girlfriend at the Time, introduced me to this Album back in 1998. I remember she told me that she wanted to show me the most beautiful music that she had heard. When she played it for me I had to agree that it was indeed beautiful, I had never heard anything else like it. Soft Black Stars has never lost that for me, no matter how matter how many times I have listened to it."
4,blackcurrant ninety three,"Current 93 continue their transition into neo-classicism / minimalism apace. Herein, Tibet's songwriting makes an intensely personal shift, reaching an almost confessional tone. The fragile and sombre mood of the album is all encompassing and of equal, if not greater, intensity to their earlier more overtly 'doomy' works, and Heeman, Tibet and Stapleton's music is beautifully understated."
3,"Soft voices, black pianos but only 3 stars","with Soft Black Stars, Current 93 have released their most low-key album to date. Throughout the album, Tibets soft, almost whispering vocals are accompanied chiefly by a lone piano. The result is an album of consummate compactness, but lacking in vitality. Steven Stapleton's influence is sorely missed. To anyone unfamiliar with Current 93, and in search of an album to serve as company during long autumnal nights of introspection and solitude, this is a good purchase. In my opinion, however, it remains one of the less essential Current 93 albums."
5,Awesome book to learn by. Not just for kids either!,"I've never found books to be too terribly useful until I came across this one. I work at an ice rink in my local town where I teach basic figure skating and coach hockey. My boss had a copy of this book and I started to look through it just for tips. I found so many things that I had wanted to learn - the mohawk, three-turn, and waltz jump - as well as things I hadn't thought of. If you want to advance your skating skills, no matter what your goal, this is the book for you. There is everything from stretches and balanced diets, turns, skating techniques, and even pairs skating. It's a wonderful learning tool for all ages (definitely not just kids!!)"
2,Not What I Expected,"This book was not quite what I expected. My daughter is still a beginning skater (Freestyle 1), yet after paging through it, I found 3/4 of the book to be irrelevant to her level. The small portion of the book that would be helpful to her begins on page 161. I would only recommend this book for parents/children who are thinking about beginning skating, or have just begun to take group lessons."
4,Franklin-Green Knight,This is just another wonderful story in Franklin's life. Our two boys just love watching this DVD. It's complete and interesting to watch!! I would definitely recommend this if your child likes Franklin.
3,Love franklin,"My daughter loved a franklin dvd we owned so i got this one. She hasnt quite made this one a favorite yet, but she does love franklin and it seems like such a sweet character and story."
5,"Great Movie, DVD Only Makes It Better","""Franklin and the Green Knight"" is a top-notch production in so many ways. The story itself is very charming, captivating and enough to hold the interest of a wide variety of viewers. The music is well-done, from the feature's vocal musical numbers to the excellently scored background music. The animation is bright and colorful and the characters are all well-suited to their roles. The DVD enhances all of this. One of the best special features is a ""making-of"" featurette, which includes interviews with Paulette Bourgeois (the author of the ""Franklin Books""), Noah Reid (voice of Franklin), Kristen Bone (voice of Snail) and many other crew associated with the program. Also including is a ""music video"" feature which lets viewers quickly view any of the movie's musical numbers. For those that have a DVD-Rom on their computer, there are also games."
1,"Interesting, but not enough to keep me involved.","I was forced to read this book for a combination honors English, History class. We were studying the Guilded Age and the teachers felt this novel would help to portray exactly what people went through. Needless to say I was very bored. The descriptions are so intense and Dreiser's style of writing was not enough to keep me awake. There were certain aspects that I enjoyed, however the majority of this novel was comprised of verbose sections. This book did not really meet my expectations and I was not very satisfied. However, I was told that you might need to read it 5 times before all of the meaning would come through. I wouldn't give it the time."
4,Use with Occupations theme.,"Little Critter's sister tells about what she plans to be when she grows up. She imagines herself being able to have a variety of occupations when she gets older. I teach ESL (English as a Second Language). I found this book when I teaching about occupations. All children seem to love Little Critter, in this case his sister, so they are motivated to want to read about the occupations mentioned in the book. The pictures are great, full of lots of clues about the words on the pages. There is a minimum of text which makes it easier for children who are just starting to read to manage. I like the book and would sure like to get more copies to use in Guided Reading groups."
4,Good Book & Price,"I was looking for books to donate to a Christmas charity, with the special offer (4 for 3) going on, these were a good deal/free shipping with prime/no tax. Better than if I went to the store. Little Critter books rarely disappoint!"
1,What a title!,Perhaps I can stop cackling at the title long enough to write a jerky review .... nope .... still cackling!
3,"[Three-and-a-half stars] Not bad, once again Dr. Dino takes on the Establishment and bats over .500","There are some small serious errors Icould pick on in here, since the allwet 'Prophesy club was picking theend of the world back in the '90'sand since I am a Preterist (though Iprefer the term 'Fulfilled Prophesy'Christian), this tape is still not100% acccurate in that realm. However,the rest is basically as good as anyother Kent Hovind video done on thesubject and I certainly support Mr.Hovind in his findings there!"
1,Disappointing,I was disappointed with this holster. I had a lot of trouble getting my phone in and out of it. I never ended up using it.
4,great read,This was poem i actually liked.I not into poems at all but this one was very good one.Great to read for your kids.They will just love it.But get one with pictures in it.It will be entertaining for them.Just dont try reading shakespeare to them.
3,Warning for Kindle shoppers,"When you look at the preview of this book under the ""Kindle"" tab, all those great 19th century color illustrations are there, and they are goreous. It is at least half the reason I decided to get this editon rather than looking for it in a Robert Browning ""Complete Works"". I know, its free, so what's the big deal. The problem is that I see the Kindle, especially in color, is a great tool for delivering books to kids, and there are other similar classic kids books where all the great illustrations are there, intact. And, this is faulty marketing. It is promoting something you do not get. Again, I know, it's free. But I'm still disappointed, and you will be too, if you want the classic art work for children."
3,Not bad....,"A Tale of Two Cities is one of my favorite books and in my opinion, the best story of love and sacrifice ever written. This DVD version of the movie is OK, but I would recommend MGM's classic over this one."
3,Mediocre,"Perhaps the problem was that I watched this immediately after rereading the novel, but I didn't feel that this video captured much of the power of Dickens' work, although there were a couple of places (in particular near the end) where the plot alone was enough to carry the film. I didn't really find any of the actors convincing (with the possible exception of Miss Pross), and the production definitely felt low-budget. The mob scenes in Paris were especially weak. The Reign of Terror looked about as menacing as a group of suburban soccer moms in costume."
5,"great dvd we have viewed this dvd several times , and each time pick something new","we really enjoy this dvd and each time we watch we pick up something new, it was a replacement, and we are glad we reordered it"
3,What a disappointment!,"I was expecting so much from this production of ATTC that I must confess my disappointment upon seeing it. I now own four film versions of Dickens' masterpiece and this is the least exciting of them all. In spite of a good cast, reasonably fine art direction and a few scenes that make excellent use of locations with the adequate kind of atmosphere, the film lacks rhythm and true emotion. Above all, this version is absolutely wanting in epic dimension. The crowd scenes are ridiculously poorly staged. One never has the feeling that the characters are immersed in a Paris that was witnessing the bloodbath of the French Revolution. Truly, the 1935 Jack Conway version still stands as the best cinematic portrayal of Dickens' classic novel. The 1958 and 1980 versions place second and third by comparison, and the present one comes as a distant fourth. Too bad."
2,And you thought reading the book in high school was a killer,"Just try sitting through this humdrum, humorless, dramaless lash-up. It is a far, far better thing to rent the 1935 Ronald Colman version. It is a far, better rest you will get while sleeping through this travesty. Masterpiece Theater got the Emperor's New Clothes instead of A Tale of Two Cities. Madame Defarge as a pin-up model, indeed. Switch her with Miss Pross and you've got it. Avoid this movie at all costs. 5 stars for putting your English class to sleep, teachers."
3,Good production,"This version of A Tale of Two Cities was good and entertaining, but I would not rate it as excellent since it does not captivate the viewer with exceptional production nor cinematography. However, I did enjoy it and would recommend it to others."
2,They cut the extras,"I dunno about the stand-alone Blu Ray, but the DVD of ""Otis"" has a ton of great extras (commentary, deleted/alternate scenes/ending, featurette, trailers, etc.). This version, however, has no extras whatsoever. I thought the point of Blu Ray was being able to jam more on the disc while maintaining superior picture quality.On the plus side, ""Dr. Giggles"" has never looked better, and this seems to be the only Blu Ray release of that film. Though it's weird that they've paired it with a completely unrelated movie made nearly 20 years later.If you're only interested in the films themselves, you can't beat the price. But the lack of extras is irksome."
5,A wonderful insite to the mind,"I'm a HUGE fan of Baum.Always have been. Ever since I was a kid. Reading Baum in published order is an ever ongoing project with me. Now I'm not one who wants to take apart the wonderful stories and put all the elements into little boxes and find out what they are make of, but this book does something that is just the opposite. It takes the stories and looks at them in the order in which they were written! This book is a wonderful look at the ""periods"" in the Baum Canon. This is a great look at how say something like the Life and Adventures of Santa Clause and Queen XiXi of IX relate to each other. Great writing and research makes this book a MUST for any Baum collector."
1,The book has no practical information,"This book was terrible. I bought it in the hopes of learning something better than the normal mneumonic techniques;however,her book showed techniques that were impractical and plain dumb. For all those out there looking for a good book on memory that will really WORK!!!! Try Harry Lorayne and Jerry Lucas's The Memory Book. The techniques are easy to learn, but will take time to apply to information for school. However, you will be rewarded for your efforts."
5,So You Wanna Be a Comic Book Artist,"This book takes you all the way from inspiration thru getting your meterial out there to be evaluated. Chapters include: starting a studio, tools of the trade, illustration tips and tricks, creating the characters, creating the story line/scripts, putting it all together, copy-shop comics, promotion and getting publicity for your work, submitting your comics to publishers, video game designing, sources and essential comic book terminology. The book is a complete source for anyone interested in pursuing the field, old or young--anyone."
1,I Wasted 10 valuable hours of my life,This book is appauling. I love horror books but this one is written in such an amateurish way that I am sure that Mr Cunningham must return either to his previous job as an art expert or take up a new proffession as an extra on the next Flintstones movie. Truly a waste of time.
1,DONT BUY THIS JUNK UNLESS YOU ARE AN ELF,"They charge almost $15 for this condom oops I mean hat, that costs only $2 in the store!!!!! And it's tiny it's like they made this for an elf.... Don't buy"
2,Nextel User,"If you only need your clip to last about 3 months then this is for you. Maybe someone who works in an office could wear this clip but it is of no use on a job site. I think the design is poor, being that the working swivel parts are made of plastic, which over time will wear out. I'm searching for an alternative"
1,Major Disappointment,"As a lover of all things Austen, I was very excited when I first came upon this book. But this completion of Sanditon is incredibly weak. The plot wanders aimlessly, although ""wanders"" is perhaps too favorable of a term since it implies some momentum.Worse, the characterization is frightfully dull. The previous Sanditon completion in the 1970s by ""Another Lady"" is vastly superior, fleshing out very memorable characters and making you really care about Charlotte. By the end of this book, I didn't care about any of the characters as they were so frightfully dull. The climactic conclusion was more like an afterthought; perhaps the writer(s) wanted to be done with the book as fast as I did.Avoid this debacle and track down the completion by ""Another Lady"" instead."
1,"A waste of time, not worth reading","I found this novel terrible and was a waste of time. I can't bare reading another page after chapter 11 where Austen had left it. This is by far the worst novel I've ever read. If you want to read the completed version of Sanditon, I would suggest Sanditon by Another Lady. It's a good novel and was well done compare to this clumsy one. This novel is not at all worth reading."
4,Jane Austen Would Be Proud,"Julia Barrett has done a wonderful job capturing the imagery set out by Jane Austen. Austen would be proud, and if she were still with us, would probably be posting her own rave on Amazon!"
4,word warrior,"Julia Barrett's completion of Jane Austen's last novel, renamed CHARLOTTE must have been an irrisitible challenge to Ms. Barrett who has previously paid homage to Austen by daring to evoke the language and the ethos in replicated sequels to the master's most famous works. This requires a devotion as well as an affinity to that period:an understanding of the spoken word of that era. Then with this unique skill Ms.Barrett recreates the emotions, the play of interaction in society,which becomes an holiday of words unlike our functional, at best, verbal exchanges. Ms. Barrett's vision has been realised in this rare and courageously written narrative. CHARLOTTE is especially interesting for it serves as a journey away from our daily interests. Someone might remark Ms Barrett inhabited Jane Austen's milieux in another life!"
1,Absolutely awful - zero stars!,"I love all of JA's work, and have also read many sequels/continuations with varying degrees of enjoyment. But this is by far the worst. It has nothing of JA's style, wit, irony, insight into human nature, etc., etc., etc. The people who gave this 'work' good reviews must only have read the fragment actually written by JA or must be shills for the publisher. For more detailed comments, I recommend reading any of the many reviews which gave 1 star, which I assume they did because they did not know one could give zero, or the amazon web site won't allow it; if you find this review listed with the generous rating of 1 star, then you will it is the latter."
3,Diverting but not the real Austen,"When I saw ""Charlotte"" on the shelf, I was intrigued that there might be one more manuscript that I hadn't heard of. It turns out to be a very readable retread of the ""Sanditon"" text that has been published in other forms.The author does a good job in recreating some of Austen's signature style, but it seems that the skeleton plot she received did not help her to adequately fill the 240 pages. Some chapters were full of the wit, satire and excellent characterizations typical of an Austen book--others just jumped quickly to cover plot points, and seemed slapdash.I would be curious to go back to other versions of ""Sanditon"" to see if they were more successful. As I said, this was a diverting text, I read through it in only 3 sittings--but it didn't have the depth of a ""Persuasion"", or the excellent characterizations of ""Pride and Prejudice"", or the conflicts and satisfying conclusions of any of her books."
5,Spellbinding - a must read!,"Here's a true realization for that tantalizing opening of Jane Austen's last novel! Critics have always agreed that SANDITON would have led her into new territory. Not only would it have taken her out of her bit of countryside into a bigger geography, but invited her to venture further into the realities of her Regency world. The Sussex coast bring her into the mania and speculation of the new health faddism and more.Julia Barrett has taken Austen's themes up boldly, and carries them to the conclusions she had in mind. And, Barrett's done it with bravura, wit and style. Better still, all this serves as a background to what always concerns Austen: that age-old game lovers play."
2,Not for kids under 12 years old,"While the finished product--a working phone with see-through cover and flashing lights--is great, this toy is definitely not easy to assemble. It took a bright 9-year-old, her 40-year-old aunt, and the child's grandfather (well-versed in electronics) two hours or more to finally get all the pieces in place! The parts seem to be well made and the phone really *does* work, but the directions are very difficult to understand and there was no explanation whatsoever of how a phone works. In short, what was supposed to be a fun ""learning experience"" turned out to be an exercise in frustration. This kit is probably best suited for teenagers or adults who already have some background in electronics."
5,Extroidinary Novel,This book was beautifully and passionately written. It is a love story unique and philosophical. Do we choose our own fates? Alvina will tell you.
5,Numark PT01 Portable DJ Turntable,"Excelent product. I connected to my computer easily, could play LP's, 45's and 78's, has speaker; earphone connection, does not need pre-amplifier and once you get the music in your computer with a program like Audacity or DAK Editor you can copy, edit and put into Wave or MP3. Highly recommended for the price, if you're a high tech person this might not be that great but for must of us it works perfectly"
2,poor construction,"Straight out of the box I could not play any record on this turntable without the record grinding at the base of the deck on every rotation. It seems like mine has the same flaw as another reviewer's, which is that the silver base of the unit is not attached firmly enough to hold. I've tried raising the platter with a piece of felt, which prevents the record from hitting the deck, but then the pitch is still a bit unstable and wobbly on many records. I am sure this could have been prevented if Numark had used some screws instead of glue to attach the parts of the deck to one another.However, I am still in doubt whether I am going to return it because I like the overall design and features so much. Hence, two stars instead of one. Maybe I am going to try fixing it with some super glue ... if anyone with the same problem has tried this, I would love to hear in the comments whether your attempt has failed or succeeded."
5,Numark PT01 Portable DJ Turntable Review,"Excellent value.I have over one-hundred 78 RPM records. I copied the records onto CD's using this turntable connected to my computer and Microsoft Plus software. The result is a sound that was better than the original and much more convenient.The turntable is very compact, easy to set up and operate. I had no trouble at all."
4,easy enough for a child,my five year old loves it and has been playing it every day since we got it.it's not too loud.We hooked it up to an amplifier and it was louder althoughthe sound quality was still just ok. One little plastic tab broke off the lidthe first day but it still works fine and stays on. We LoVE it.
2,Great while it lasted.,"On nearly the second anniversary of receiving this player, the table stopped spinning. I called Numark and since it was out of warranty there was nothing they could do for me. The player was awesome. It one of my favorite belongings. The sound was pretty good for a built-in speaker. None of my records were damaged by the player, and the speed never seemed to waver. I gave it one star for every year of enjoyment I got. I'll be buying a crosley next, and if that one craps out I would probably buy another Numark. I just wish it hadn't have broken in the first place."
1,Pure junk,"I'd always heard great things about numark products, so I decided to roll the dice on the PT01, a big mistake. The good, is that it is a light weight truly portable turntable. The built in speaker provides pretty good sound for being a small speaker. Why the 1 star? b/c the player is poorly constructed. The shiny top piece is poorly glued on, and pops up rubbing against the record while its playing. This causes the record to wobble and creates a very poor sound. I had to put a weight on the player to keep the piece from popping up in order for it to play properly. Little to say I will be staying away from numark products, and I highly recommend that anyone in the market for a player such as this look else where."
1,Poor Quality Control,The large silver colored base around the platter would NOT stay in place. It is only held down by a sticky material underneath it. The one I purchased was raised up just behind the platter and rubbed on the record. Very poor quality construction and no final inspection at the factory. Good luck if you buy one. I returned mine to Amazon. It's been over two (2) weeks and I have not received any acknowledgment from Amazon regarding the return.
1,Turntable is uneven.,"I bought this for my roommate as a Christmas/graduation present. When she opened it and threw a record on we noticed a distortion in the sound which we initially attributed to the record being warped. Several more records later and we discovered that the felt on the turntable was unevenly applied, causing a ""hump"" in the record's path under the needle, distorting the music. To be fair, we haven't contacted the manufacturer yet to see if this is something that could be repaired or replaced. It's still disappointing to give a gift that's nonfunctional however."
4,Pretty nice,"This portable record player is great to take record stores, listening parties, etc. I wouldn't use it to try to entertain a party full of people, as the volume isn't very loud. It's great for what it's intended for."
2,"3 years later, it is dead now.","On the back of this record player, it was manufactured in January of 2008 and now in October of 2011 it is dead. Pretty sure the belt just died on it.I had it set up to play through my computer speakers and as long as you have a decent system it should sound good. I played records on it quite often, but I still think it should've lasted more than 3 years. I also had the same issue other reviews stated about the bottom plate sticking up, but I just taped it down and that worked fine.Probably should just pay a little more for something a little better than this one."
4,Good,"I previously bought one, that messed up within a week of me playing it. The clamp that holds the arm bar in place broke as I was snapping it in place, and the records started sounding like chimpmunks. So Numark replaced it within a week, and the one I have now works fine. I'd heard excellent reviews from [...] so I definitely wanted to give it another shot. I know this is their cheapest and most low budget player. I'm just getting started with vinyl, and am pretty excited to play a lot more records. And if I ever wanted to preview the records at the store, it just needs batteries."
3,"Good for portable, very bad for archival purposes.","First of all, the $279 Price Tag can't be right. I bought this at Guitar Center for $60.It's pretty decent for a portable turntable if you want to take something small and light out to the record store to sample some music before you buy. It has a decent built in speaker/headphone jack/and RCA outputs. This is nice for when you want to listen to records somewhere other than where your main stereo set up is.As far as archiving, this is a piece of junk. If you really don't care about preserving all the great quality from your vinyl then you won't mind but this thing can't really handle most music. Also, the program it comes with kind of sucks.I would recommend spending a decent amount of money on a heavier turn table and upgrading the sound card on your computer if you care about quality. Even if you decide to buy this, don't pay more than $75."
3,Can't beat it for the price,"A portable turntable that runs on batteries, is lightweight, has two headphone jacks and a pitch control, AND plays 78's...this baby rocks!Now, I had the same issue that many had with the face plate coming unglued and rubbing on the records while playing. But, I simply put some super glue in there and haven't had a single problem since.I originally bought one of the Crosley portable turntables and it quit working in the first two weeks, so I returned it and got the Numark. I've been happy ever since.A final word--this isn't audiophile quality. But, for under 100 bucks, you're not going to get that from any turntable."
1,Unsatisfied,"I purchased this turntable to listen to records. However, the speaker is so faint it's barely audible. I've returned it and am back to looking for a good one. This turntable is perfect if you're looking to transfer audio or use external speakers...just don't count on it to stand on its own."
4,DOCTOR GRAZ,AN EXCELLENT CHOICE. I NEEDED A SMALL TURNTABLE TO FIT ON MY SHELF FOR PLAYING MY OLD RECORDS. I HOOKED IT UP TO MY BIG STEREO SYSTEM AND IT WORKS JUST FINE. WOULD BUY IT AGAIN IF NEEDED.
1,Would be great if it worked,"I received this same record player as a gift a few years ago, and it works fine for me. But when I bought another record player for my roommate, it played for 6 days and then completely died. Flip the power switch, no light, and the machine won't turn when you move the needle. I asked for a return, but won't be receiving any refund because the box it came in isn't the box it was sent back in, because I'd already recycled the cardboard. Apparently, the company values the cardboard box much higher than the machine, so be super careful. It's a piece of crap, and they know it."
1,Stopped working,"I bought the Numark PT-01 USB portable turntable in January of 2009 and was pleased with it at first. I hadn't used it for about a year and today when I tried it the turntable did not play at the correct speed. There was no difference between the 33 and 1/3, 45 and 78 rpm settings, and even at the 78 speed the rate was slower than 33 and 1/3. I have no idea how to get this fixed. When I was using it it was also very difficult to get replacement styluses. I don't think Numark still supports this product and wouldn't recommend it."
5,A rare find,"I found this album only because it was playing in a local record store when i was there. I immediately loved it and purchased it that visit. This album has a very downbeat sound that is mostly instrumental. The lyrics that are included are very fitting and the music never seems to get beyond a pleasant, soft, and medium speed. With mellow and almost hypnotizing rhythms, it is perfect music to listen to in the evening, and mellow enough to sleep to. Apparently there are two good things out of Iceland."
4,Good product,I bought this as a Christmas gift and she loved it. Will probably be buying it again for the same person.
1,Wrong item sent,I ordered a 2m USB download cable for a Nikon Coolpix Model 4600 digital camera. The item that arrived had the wrong connector for my camera which made it worthless for me. The item cost about $5 and I didn't think it was worth the time to send it back.
2,Overpriced shipping,"Sure the cable costs ""1 cent"", but the shipping is 6 bucks. Kind of overpriced for such a small item, and this pricing strategy is deceptive. I would be happy paying $6 for this cable with shipping included, but I don't appreciate the seller trying to pull a fast one on their customers by pricing it this way..."
3,Wrong cable for my camera,"Item arrived promptly, but it is the wrong cable for my camera. Need to contact customer service to see if I can return it."
5,One of the CDs I'm really glad I bought.,"""Everything Is Wrong"" is my personal favorite of Moby's albums. It has such techno as ""Feeling So Real,"" such minimalist classical as ""God Moving Over the Face of the Waters,"" and many more. It's one of the CDs that I listen to constantly, and yet do not tire of."
3,Good Rough Draft,"This is a great example of Moby spreading himself out to thin; no particular style receives the attention it requires to manifest itself in a great song. In short, the disc is uneven, lacking cohesion, not fully ripe; yet, on the upside, if you suspend your critical nature for a moment, it can be a fun listen."
4,Moby's OTHER Defining Album,"Long before there was Play, 18, the Gwen Stefani duets, or videos in spacesuits, there was Everything is Wrong, the album where Moby slid in under the radar and came into his own. It's an ambitious and groundbreaking album, that goes from piano laced ambient (""Hymn"" and the seminal ""God Moving Over the Face of the Waters"") to infectious get-on-your-feet techno (""Feeling So Real"") to trance like investigations into deeper musical channels (""First Cool Hive"" and ""Anthem"", which is a personal favorite). Though a bit uneven, this is by far a defining album for Moby, and an extremely worthwhile listen for anyone who enjoyed ""Play"" or ""18""."
3,Is it really that good?,"'Every Thing Is Wrong' was the first album of the prolific Moby that I purchased. On the first hearing, I thought it was immature, poppy techno. Subsequent hearings of the album did little to abate this inital feeling. However, all that said, taken at face value, the recording is still an enjoyable one. Try not to think too hard about the music and it will take you into a moody trance from which it is hard to break until the conclusion of the final track.The interlinking songlets of techno-punk-thrash are undoubtably shocking, even on the 101st hearing of the album, and, for me, detract from the album's trance-like feel.I may not read between the lines on this one as much as I should, but taken at face value, it is still an enjoyable album."
3,"pretty good, but not Moby's best","""Everything Is Wrong"" has an interesting mix from rapid, techno-infused tracks to trance cuts to ballad-like folk tunes. While several of the tracks are excellent (notably ""Feeling So Real"" & ""First Cool Hive""), I found the overall mix to be fairly jarring and incongruous. IMO, not as good as ""Play"" album."
3,Misled,"I bought this Cd because I read that it was one of the best of 1995. Well, I didn't see anything really great about it. I really didn't listen to it that much after buying it and I listen to it less now. However a few tracks stand out in my mind ""Hymn"", ""First Cool Hive"" and ""Anthem"". The others are nothing spectacular."
2,"The sound, the fury, the mediocrity","This is supposed to be trail-blazing, genre-defining music? Sure, it's more interesting than anything your parents are probably listening to at the moment, but that does not make a great record. If you consider Puff Daddy a more innovative rap artist than Public Enemy and Eric B. then you'd probably also pick Moby over Aphex Twin, Orbital, Leftfield, A Guy Called Gerald, The Chemical Brothers and plenty of other Brits who have done more interesting, compelling things with this type of music."
4,Why not fuse moby and some rock?,"The atonal approach with fluctuating volumes and busy motives underlining the orchestral pulsating in some tracks is what i liked most. If only he had spent a bit more score time on tonal action, I think the album could have been better.Also fat boy slim has great sounds. but something new would be fusing these with some jazz or rock. Just check E.S.T. or Fusio's album Perfect Circumstances for example.Why not dance to some piano and stings for example?Check this for example:http://www.amazon.com/Perfect-Circumstances/dp/B0047XLQE0/ref=sr_shvl_album_1?ie=UTF8&qid;=1290798488&sr;=301-1"
5,what would be better title than Review,For everyone who was too young at the time for listening him.For everyone who got to know him only by that time when his creations started to belong to up-to-date and soooo cool outfits.For everyone who is wondering what's this special music that's coming out of the speakers in Target.For everyone who wants to know how his whole masterwork started.But most importantly: for everyone who is able to recognize that he is a real genius -and it is really rare today...
2,Saved by two tracks,"Being a big sopranos fan and having watched episode ""join the club"" where Tony is having his dreams while his on the e.r. from a gun wound from his crazed uncle. I heard the brilliant track titled "" when its cold i like to die"" by moby sang by Mimi Goese, who also sang into the blue. Both tracks are wonderfull but i realy hate Mobys techno songs but his slow songs are realy great. Almost the whole album sounds pretty annoying, except for the two slow tunes. Moby stick to your slow songs : )"
2,such a letdown,"i had a single from this album and a song called IN MY LIFE completely rocked my world...MY MISTAKE. do not call this album techno. call it top 40, or electronic but not techno and do not call it punk rock inflenced or even rock oriented. there is little rock on this album. this album is the predeccesor to play. if thats your bag then by all means this is for you but it is a bland mix of top 40 wanna be music.i also bought animal rights by moby. THAT is quite electic with a good mix of musical styles...yes i did like the soothing intro of hymn, the funky beat of lets go free (song is 37 seconds long) and the blues of what love but this is not a reason to keep this overrated mess. although i do love the thought provoking essays in moby's cd's but otherwise this is not worth your time."
1,Everything is WRONG on this CD,"This is a marked departure from Moby and his regular music. If you are looking for tradiitonal Moby stay away from this CD. It is loud, a mishmash of musical instruments banging away with little listening pleasure."
2,Reclaiming a Genre,"Dear Reviewers:Please don't call this album techno; this is not techno. Call it electronica, call it top 40, call it dance music, but please not techno. If you want to write about techno, review something by Jeff Mills, Plastikman, Joey Beltram or Frankie Bones at least. Though this commercial dance music album borrows heavily from many generes, it fails to represent any of them decently, as it usually happens with market-driven music."
5,WITHOUT A DOUBT MY FAVORITE ALL-TIME ALBUM!,"I BOUGHT THIS ALBUM BACK IN 1995 AFTER LISTENING TO ONE OF THE TRACKS AT LA BOOM IN CANCUN, MEXICO. IT IS WITHOUT A DOUBT AN ASTOUNDING ALBUM. I COULD NEVER GET SICK OF IT. THE DAY THAT I DIE I'LL TAKE THIS TO THE GRAVE."
4,Moby is a genius,"""Everyting is Wrong"" is the album of the 90's. Moby has grasped what is needed to create a wonderfull album. People don't understand that Moby is a genius, his music has no catagory (don't belive me? check out his album, ""Animal Rights""). Moby can create dance beats and classical all on one album. Solid."
3,Asia Now and When?,"An interesting sampler on the newer Asia, the John Payne era with a twist...the band goes back and re-records the earlier John Wetton hits with Payne singing and playing lead guitar (instead of Steve Howe)...with not-so-good results. The story is that the band had to re-record the songs note for note and spirit-for-spirit as the original group and the old songs just don't measure up.This album does not even include all the best songs of the newer band, but does make for a great introduction to the new band's style, including a good new song, ""Different Worlds"", and a remake of the GTR song, ""The Hunter"" (written by Geoff Downes)."
1,Typical new Asia - trying to re-write history,"Anthology, like the great Communist purges of 1930s and 40s, appears to be an attempt to act as if the past never happened. Why else would Geoff Downes think he could get away with re-recording the band's best-known hits with a singer-guitarist (John Payne) who can't hold a candle to either John Wetton or Steve Howe? Payne's re-makes are embarrasing, and the new stuff is woefully poor; as dreadful as the new material on ""Then & Now"" was, I'd rather listen to that compared with anything this disc has to offer."
1,AWFUL!!!!,Geoff Downes really butchered some classic songs from this classic band! Rerecording classic songs with an awful singer is THE worst thing ever accomplished in modern music. The songs even take a slight dance feel that worsens it even more! This band sucks!!!!!(BRING BACK JOHN WETTON!!!)
4,A compact & very helpful guidebook!,"This is a great little book! Small enough to carry around on the streets with you and nicely broken down into areas of use; Air Travel, Restaurants, Shopping, Telephones, etc. VERY easy to use with LOTS of important information such as numbers, months, and time of day to name a few. Especially useful were the Conversion Tables in the back. Also includes a mini-dictionary. A great little book for the Danish traveler!"
2,A old fashioned sci-fi story!,"When I read this book I was only twenty years old. In general, I think that the plot line and characterizations aren't so good, but the story has a certain charm and style that resemble some old sci-fi classics of the 30's, like Flash Gordon and The Red Purple Monster. That is the most positive point of the book; but Anderson did other better works, like, for example, Tau Zero and Unlimited Orbit."
4,Great for a fun counting book,My LO likes to count objects while she's reading (I hold her hand and we count up all the objects in the picture together). I love monsters. So basically this book entertains us both. It's humorous and cute.
3,"I love it, but I guess it's a matter of preference.","I personally think this is an adorable book. I have a 2 and a 4 year old, however, and neither are interested. I'm not sure why! Maybe they will like it in the future. Or maybe my grandkids will like it! :)"
5,Excellent Read for Mom & Sons,"Me and my 2 1/2 year old boy just LOVED this book. He is very much into numbers and has been counting for a few months, so I got this book for him. It's one of the few books he sits for through the whole story. He especially loves the page for ""four"" ;).It is also good for his older brother, who is in kindergarden and learning how to read / spell the number words."
2,More reliable resources are available,"Kent Hovind is not a scientist, biologist, or archeologist. He was a Christian school teacher who begain collecting and compiling information and theories about creationism and evolution into a series of lectures and sermons. Some of what he has to say is good, while some is rejected by even creationists. Dr. Hovind is also a believer in conspirarcy theories regarding the UN, the US Government, and 9-11, and is a tax resister (which led to his conviction on tax evasion charges). While this has little to do with his work on creationism, it does call into question his credibility.If you want to research or study creationism, I recommend that you pass on Dr. Hovind's work and check out material by organizations like Answers In Genesis and Creation Ministries International. They employ real scientists and are much more reliable sources of creationist material."
3,Quick Trip...,"This is a review of the STERLING/PEARSON DVD ""Bob Hope Film Collection"" edition (with the green cover!) I hope that helps set this apart from the other editions and reviews...The film is a good example of the Road movies - it's no Utopia or Morocco, but it's still very entertaining. Lamour is ravishing whilst Hope and Crosby wise-crack and soft-shoe with the best of 'em. All in all a four star movie.However, this DVD has a rather pathetic amount of extras (ie. none), a fair-to-middling print and a very low audio track. My suggestion is to find another DVD edition. At the end of the day - we all want to upgrade from VHS to DVD, so why settle for an edition that is estentially lower quality?"
4,I Hate You. I Loathe You. I Despise You.,"Every great film has a repeating line, and Road to Rio has that one. It's always been one of my favorites - if not THE favorite - of the road pictures, but maybe the lustre has worn off. Still, ""I hate you. I loathe you. I despise you"" is a long-time family joke, and this film, if it grabs you at the right moment, is a gem. The musical numbers, as usual, are terrific, and there are so many throw-away lines and sight gags that this ""road"" is one that should be traveled."
5,Another road classic,A great gift for someone who is a huge fan of the road pictures. This is the last one we have yet to see and I am sure it will be great.
5,wonderful,"I had all the movies in this ""road"" series that spanned 20 years, except Road to Rio. So glad to have found the DVD version as I only had the VHS one and it was worn out. Love Hope and Crosby and Lamour in all their road movies and will share them with all my friends."
1,shoddy electronics,"I don't know what the deal is, but this thing has been slowly dying for us. First the power off button stopped working. Now the Record Light on the front will not stop blinking and no matter what I do (including unplugging it) it blinks, no commands work, and weird numbers are displayed across the screen. Just poorly made I guess."
1,honestly speaking,"We purchased this TV at Best Buy.....within two weeks the VCR player quit working....we took it back & got another on exchange.....within a week the VCR player quit working on the exchanged TV.....we are taking it back this weekend and requesting another brand of TV. I don't think we will be purchasing Sylvania products for a while. Once bitten, twice shy....Twice bitten, a lot more smarter.I hope this review saves you some hassle. I do not recommend this TV."
5,The Wolf's Swan Song,"This is the last album The Wolf recorded. It has some top-notch songs on it, and a couple of not-so top-notch (the electric harpsichord is overdone!)For any Wolf fan, this is a must. Even after a heart attack or two and kidneys that no longer functioned, Wolf showed on this album that he could still howl like no one else.Recommended"
4,Wolf's Last and One of His Best,"This is an often overlooked and underrated album by Howlin' Wolf. This was his last album and he is actually in good voice and plays some great harmonica. What I like about this album is the content. Newer songs like 'Coon on the Moon' and 'Watergates Blues' stand out for me. It's not just a rehash of his hits. A major issue with the album is the harpsichord, which can be found on a number of tracks. Too much of this happended in the early 70's and it really dates the album. This would not be the first place I start to discover the great Howlin' Wolf, but would be a nice addition to round out a collection."
3,Not his best Howl,"I found this album at Hastings for six dollars and thought that it was some sort of steal. It turns out it is worth about that.I really enjoy the other Howlin Wolf albums that I have, but I did not like this one near as much as those. For the most part, it did not seem to have the angry/powerful edge that I associate with Howlin Wolf. I think that my favorite cuts were the ""moving"" cut and the alternate take at the end of the album. These seem to have a passionate feeling to them, as opposed to some of the other cuts that have a tired feel.I am not a blues purist, necessarily (I enjoy the RL Burnside remixes almost as much as the originals), but I really hated the harpsichord that was on several cuts. It seemed like it was added just to add something, not to add something of value to the record. In some ways sort of like Howlin Wolf's Electric Mud."
4,A glimpse of medieval life.,The Pig Plantagenet is a fantasy which gives the reader entertainment and a view of European medieval rural life. This book is along the lines of Watership Down and The Sword in the Stone.
2,Needs work,"As a wheelchair user, I am always looking for a bag or pouch that I can use on the sides of my chair so when I saw these, they looked like they might work. On the plus side, they attach easily over the chair arms with velcro fasteners and are sturdily made from denim. On the minus side, the pocket is not deep enough and the bag tends to hang over the wheels, getting in the way when I'm trying to push myself around. The product description says they can be used for wheelchairs, walkers and bedrails. I think these pouches would work best on walkers. On bedrails, because of the shallow depth of the pouch, when the bed is raised to a sitting position, the contents of the pouch might fall out. It's a good idea but I think it needs a redesign. I would recommend them only for walkers."
4,Maritime Design,"Not exactly bedtime reading, but definitely a bit of a bible on the subject. Certainly covers the theory in much more detail than the many design standards that refer to it..."
3,FRENETIC BARRAGE,"Here, I have a billion ideas and I want to cram them all into your forehead all at once! A frenetic barrage. The design/calculation seems to have been to disorient, confuse, and flash as much as possible. Not new age (!) in any way. Not for heart attack people, high blood pressure, or anyone adversely affected by strobe, or light-speed wormhole travel. The music doesn't help--it's all hyper-upsetting. Lost opportunity art wise. Any worthwhile moment is rubbed out by the need for speed. Too bad."
5,...whoa.,"I watched this movie yesterday. um.......wow. Weirdest thing ever. It should be rated R. There is only one word in the entire video and it's ""Help"". Personally, I think this movie was made by a very bored animator who was not doing what he was supposed to and was in the middle of a phsycotic breakdown.Yup.Buy this movie.It is worth your 85 cents."
2,I hated it!,"You may like it, I hated it! Let me tell you why; the graphics are choppy and blocky. The music is nerve grating and frenetic. The images are very dark on content as well visually. I missed the gracefulness that I've seen in other DVD of this type and I had to fast forward through most of it as it was giving me one heck of a headache. As I said I hated it, but you must decide for yourself if it is more to your taste. I hope I made it clear why I didn't like so that those of you who enjoy frenetic music and its kind will explore it further, and you who are looking for floating gleefulness and soothing music will Stay Away! DJ"
2,Once upon a time,"When Soft Image was a novelty and 3D construction a really defying task for computers and designers, this work could be considered a reference. It has gone old though. Once the techniques used in the animation are not so complex anymore, some of then are features of today 3d softwares, some so simple that even my young daughter masters, the animation gets very boring and naive looking at some point. Music is not so good to be worth the whole work. Even so, the authors deserve their merit."
4,Whoa,"Just go to YouTube and type ""On Concrete In Seattle""... The homeless lady with the live chicken is a site to SEE!"
5,a great book,"A very good book indeed, it brings in a lot of information,although there is no way one can confirm it or not."
1,What a Setup!,"I was going along with most of this until the last two chapters when it becomes very similar to the Left Behind Christian rubbish. Most of the principals the ET's present are very close to Eastern philosophies and religions. But then the last couple of chapters predicts the Second Coming of Jesus where he will collect his flock. Those not ready will have to wait another 26,000 years to be ""saved"". One of the ETs even claims to be John the Baptist. Avoid unless you are a Left Behind fairy tale fan."
1,Wrong quantity - wasted time.,"I ordered a item which was clearly marked as a box of 10, ordered 4 boxes, and only received 4 items total. Waste of time, go with a another seller who actually reads their item descriptions.Scotch-Brite 7446 Gray Stainless Pads - Box of 10"
4,Nice small classic knife,"If your looking for small pocket knife with classic styling, look no further. Holds a great edge, good folding action.Happy with the purchase!"
5,True Gospel,I really love this CD. The songs will not only get you through the week but the month and year. Vickie is really encouraging the songs give hope and joy. This is a must have for everyone.
5,Great book!,"The book essentially describes our three and a half year boy. The first chapter is almost a biography of him. We have gone through some of the same frustrations that other parents have had (especially with an incompetent audiologist). The book confirmed what we always suspected that our boy is a very bright and very analytical child (very good with computers, etc.) that just happens to be a late talker. We will have him evaluated by a pediatricain specializing in a development clinic just in case but we are convinced that there is nothing wrong with him. This is a great book!"
2,"Lots of Stories, No Real Conclusions...","I purchased this book because I am interested in the topic of language generally. I found Sowells book to be basically a collection of anecdotal information strung together without any real conclusions drawn from his ""data."" The sample study was incredibly small, which might explain his hesitancy to cast any general conclusions. But ideally *some* analysis could have been done."
2,Very concerned about The Einstein Syndrome,"First of all, I am quite offended by this author. I am a licensed speech-language pathologist with 30 years of experience in the public school system. I am currently working as a special education coordinator in (heaven forbid) a public school system. I read about children and their issues/concerns/characteristics continuously. This book was recommended by a parent and I was very excited to read it. I was not prepared for the assault on speech-language pathologists and others in the public schools of America. I truly wish the author would do a more thorough investigation of our credentials and our job performances. We are not in the business of ""creating business"". Believe me, we have plenty to keep us busy. We are, however, very dedicated to children and their needs....whether that involves ""Einstein type children"", Asperger's, Autistic, Hyperlexic, Attention Deficit Disordered, Gifted or any of the multitude of diagnoses."
5,Answers with a twist,"A FANTASTIC read... The ""twist"" is that it bases the core reason for late talking on heredity ~ specifically tying in close family members with analytically-thinking/based careers and abilities (engineers, scientists, mathematicians, pilots, musicians, etc.) I didn't know this when I purchased the book and wanted to share that specifically. We got a lot from the book because our daughter falls into that category (otherwise the book may not have been as useful to us). ""The Einstein Syndrome"" provides great insight on ""why"", what can be done in the meantime and on ""early intervention"". If you have a late-talking child, as well as analytical minds in the family, this book definitely provides answers. **Also recommended for speech therapists/pathologists who aren't familiar with these recent, brilliant findings."
4,The Einstein Syndrome,"As a parent of a late talker - this book has really been an eye opener to me.While reading every page I felt that Thomas Solwell - has written about my child.My perspective of looking at my 4-yr-old has changed since I read this book.I recommend it as a must-read for every late-talker's parent.cheers - Maria,"
3,"Parents, don't do a wait and see, get your child tested!","After reading this, and reading all the different reviews, the same conclusion comes up. Each individual child is different, so you can't assume every child is going to fit this profile. Please... parents... seek professional help early if you see your child is developmentally slow. Don't wait, the longer you do, the more harm it can do to your child. Early intervention is key to giving your child strategies and therapy to help them with whatever issues they've got. Go to a speech language pathologist, an audiologist who specializes in childhood disorders, and get many tests done. Do it NOW! You'll never be disappointed that you did it too soon, but you will if it's done too late."
4,Triumphant!,"Exceptional music and video work, costumes are dated and mullets are a hoot...enjoy with a beer and your air guitar!"
2,Rather Have This On CD...,"The reason I gave this DVD only 2 stars were for the audio and picture quality which are SUPERB, but there are way too many crowd shots. The guys who filmed/edited this concert must not have been music fans. The most annoying shots are when Rik's singing a chorus and they zoom in on a fan. So, all you see is a fan singing and pumping her fist and they stay on her for 7-10 seconds. And they do this throughout the show. There's another song where Rik is about to rip into a solo and they instead zoom in on the crowd! Another drawback is Triumph don't play any songs from 'Never Surrender', yet they play a cover of ""Rocky Mountain Way""??? What for?Triumph's attire for the show was an eyesore, especially the outfits that Mike and Rik wore. I'm hoping Triumph release this on CD. It's a great concert sound wise. If they would have filmed with more concentration on the band rather the crowd, this DVD would be worth 5 stars."
3,Great audio dubbed over a fake concert.,"Seriously. I love the music of Triumph. I was thrilled to find out there was a DVD concert of the power song ""Somebody's Out There""! But I was really shocked while watching it. So much slow motion editing was thrown into this concert because it's clear the performance you hear isn't the same on you see. And there are many instances where you can hear singing when no one is singing and drum hits when there is no hitting. Quite a deception. But still enjoyable to listen.3 stars for the great audio. -2 for the trickery in selling a DVD ""concert""."
4,It's a great DVD simply because the band is awesome,"Triumph was one of those bands that were so underrated but they had a lot of talent. Since there aren't many concert footage out there this DVD is a must for every Triumph fan. Somewhat I like this one better than the ""US Concert"", don't mind the edition the sound is great and the footage is well...an 80's concert which seem with today's standards is ""cheesy"" but back then was excellent. I think you need to judge a concert by it's meaning when it was originally played not by today's standard, so don't mind those critics who tell you about the clothes or the hair...Triumph is all about rock n' roll and this DVD delivers.The extras are okay too. You won't be dissapointed."
5,TAC from California is an idiot!,"This Triumph DVD is not staged or studio recorded or anything of the sort. It is a live concert in Halifax. The times have changed and yes the material, music and sound are dated but it is what it is. An amazing 80's cocert that held it's own and despite the less that Stones budget Triumph used to record it, the concert does them justice. Yes, Rik Emmett was Triumph and without him they would never have existed. Anyone who knows the band knows Gil Moore and Mike Levine were no Neil Peart or Geddy Lee. but they banged out great 80's type rock that people all over loved jamming to. Buy it! It is Triumph at it's best live and you're not going to find anything better if this is what you're looking for."
5,Brings it all back,"Ordered this in June and finally had a night where I just needed to forget about the day (can you say Presidential Debate) and enjoy being 21 again. Well this brings back 1986 at the Rosemont Horizon (not where the show was filmed but where I saw it).Lay it on the Line people, these guys just had fun and made great rock and roll.Dave"
4,Heres the scoop,"OK, My fellow rock fans, heres the scoop. Yes, I grew up in the 80's and yes, I still made fun of the mullets and bad wardrobes. BUT, thats how most of those bands were at the time and when I bought this DVD I did see how things are outdated. However, the sound quality is excellent and Im sure all of you would agree that record companies should convert many more of the old VHS and even unreleased shows to DVD. I would rather have a large selection of DVD's to compare than to have only the newer bands release shows. Plus, back then ""King's X"" was just starting out, ""Dream Theater"" was basically unheard of, ""Fates Warning"" was too cheesy, so we had ""Rush"" to say it in modern terms ""keepin it real"". Even ""Yes"" cheezed out too much for my taste in the 80""s. This DVD is a must buy, so ladies and gentlemen, and even rap fans, this is a rock show that highlights the days of being great musicians and the massive light shows that we all miss."
4,Flashback****,Fans of Classic rock Sit back and take a look at Trumiph..A lost concert that will make you think what ever happen to the good old days the band has a lot of there HITS here and a few songs you may not recall makes it seem like your right back in the days when the classic rock bands were the kings..the light show is cool! and Rik Mike and Gil and in Great shape!
1,bad bad bad bad bad,i couldn't get past page 3 of this book. it's bad. don't waste your money on this one.
1,DRIVEL,"This is not a good book; if you want real mystery, read P.D. James, Conan Doyle or a host of others.Robinson's character is gimmicky; the plot is gimmicky; his writing style is gimmicky.If you have insomnia, however, this would be a good book to purchase.Also, comparing Robinson to Grisham is like comparing a painter of Elvis Presley velvets to Leonardo Da Vinci. Robinson's not a real writer, let alone an artist."
2,Sports Illustrated book of fencing,"90 pages short. Not much bigger than a paperback. Covers epee, foil, and sabre, so about 30 pages for your type of fencing. Technically accurate but not worth the money for such a short tomb."
3,good book,This is the scholarship guide for dummies. Kaplan covers everything you need to know about scholarships.I recommend it to those who don't think they have what it takes to get scholarships. Thisbook will encourage and motivate you.
3,Basic guidelines ... nothing more ...,This is a good book if you don't have a clue on how to start researching on scholarships ... it gives you basic guidelines on the torturous and complicated steps on asking for them ... but you still require more help in order to complete the process ...
2,This is a scholarship book,"I bought this book along withDebt-Free U: How I Paid for an Outstanding College Education Without Loans, Scholarships, or Mooching off My ParentsUnfortunately College For Almost Free wasn't really what I was looking for. It is a scholarship book, plain and simple. If you are a high school student or a parent of a high school student (as I am) who wants a book all about scholarships then perhaps this is the book for you. I was honestly looking for more money saving practical advice. I have skimmed this book multiple times and tried to sit down and devote time to reading it. I do not find it to be what I was looking for."
2,Not Rocket Science,I don't recommend this book because it really just tells you what you already might know: apply for every scholarship that you can. That's it.
5,College for Free,This book is an excellent choice for the parent and the student to read to get a good background prior to researching and writing good scholarships. The book was in excellent condition and the delivery was earlier than expected. Thanks to Amazon
5,Attending College for Free,This book was worth purchasing. There are some great suggestions in this book for applying for scholarships. I would recommened this book to future college students. Book was shipped promptly and received in great condition.
5,"Great 'how too"" college bound text for Juniors and Seniors",The perfect text for juniors and seniors planning to attend college. Lots of useful information organized in thoughtful chapters. I highly recommend this book for any high school staff working with students planning to attend college. Also would be very useful for parents wanting to collaborate with their son or daughter looking to reduce the cost of attendance.
5,Will Get Your Kids Scholarships,"Hello everyone,I just wanted to write in and recommend this book. It is great for those parents who want the best for their kids and who want to help them take some initiative with scholarships. This book helped get my son off the couch, and he's already won several scholarships. Now that's what I call a gift for parents! :)"
2,Guilty Pleasure,"This book is so bad, it's good. It's like the novelization of a Dickens movie. However, it's uplifting (especially for starving students like me), easy to read, and a still-contemporary reflection of capitalism and the American dream."
4,From Jonathans daugter ally,Hello...My name is ally crane and i am Jonathan crane daughter!This book is a great book if you want to know about social programs that work and things like that!It is very well written and gives the reader a lot of info. So if you want a book about it then DO get this book! P.S. it is dedicated to me...lol!My real name is alyssa!
2,Boring,I only read the first like ten pages. It was super boring so I stopped. Glad I borrowed it from the library.
2,Might as well be sleeping.......,"This book rates umong the worst books I have ever read. Wolfe goes into unnecessary details about everyone mentioned in the book. As a reader, I do not like to waste my time reading the life history of a person who has no impact on the story. I found myself wanting to just skip over these parts instead of reading them. They seem to be completely irrelevant to the story. The book would be better if it followed the life of the main character instead of characters who mean nothing. Overall, there are about 100 pages of good reading, while the other 600+ are a waste of time."
1,Don't get this Kindle version!!,"This Kindle version is loaded with distracting typos, on every page. Not worth the price."
1,Who wants to go home again to read this?,"Don't waste your time with this nonsense. I slogged my way through this novel a year or so ago, hoping there was something of value here. There was not. It is boring beyond what mere words can ever say. I'd rather cut my lawn with a pair of scissors than read this book. It would take less time and be more enjoyable."
1,the absolute worst!!!,"Does anyone have the guts to evaluate honestly???? This book is pathetic, 100 page tangents with absolutely no relevancy litter this book. It is dull writing and so unfocused that the only reason to continue reading it is that it is a ""classic"". Well classics usually receive the title for a reason, but mistakes abound... I realize we all have different opinions, mine is that the only reason one would claim to like this book is that they are 'cultured'...i have no specific comments to make because this novel has no redeeming thing about it (and because I read it 5 years ago and no way in hell am i going to go through that again just to give a fair review). By all means, read this 'classic' and then read any hemingway you can find...and then think for yourself (or don't, I guess i don't really care)"
1,THE WORST FAMOUS AMERICAN WRITER EVER BORN,Without a doubt Thomas Wolfe is the worst...I tried reading this book many years ago...it was awful and dull and boring beyond description...anyone who recomends this book must be a dullard.c
4,Insightful and Entertaining,"This is an excellent piece of literature. I found it not only interesting to read with extremely lifelike characters, but it was extremely insightful and discussed many ideas that affect people. I found the character of George Webber to be one of the most lifelike characters in any book I've read, Wolfe's characterization is excellent. Throughout this book you see Webber grow and change as a person, I found that very interesting. I especially enjoyed book 6, which is about the nazi control in Germany. I found that to be a sad, yet extremely interesting portion of the book because it shows to some degree what the German citizens felt about the nazi control. As a whole, I enjoyed the book very much. I only gave it 4 stars because it was a bit too wordy, the plot dragged in spots and Wolfe discussed some ideas in far too much detail. However despite that I still found it to be an excellent novel."
2,"Thorough but extraneous, colorful but blinding . . .","Wolfe is an extraneous writer. He wants to tell us about everything from the protoganist's deceased dog, buried three summers ago, to the aunt who died when he was a child. Each comes with a complete history. While some of these tangents of Wolfe's can be fascinating, most of the time it just slows the peice up and makes us want to move onto something faster, something with a better pace. With all this color, all these descriptions of extraneous subject matter, I think we as readers become blinded to the writing's main intentention. This can't be truer in the case of his classic, ""You Can't Go Home Again."""
3,Entertaining but that's about it!,"Ok, here's the scoop on this DVD. I read the other reviews to find the ratings vary from low to high. It's really hard to put a good review but also hard to put a bad review as this title does give you a lot of information about sex and builds up the confidence of both the male and female if you think you're not the best at being sexual with your partner. Being English I found this DVD to be quite funny with it's dry sense of humour and it's full of English actors from the past 20 years. But if you're looking to spark up your love life I wouldn't recommend this DVD. This is a DVD that could be developed into the school ciriculum, because I did learn lots of good information from it. I hope this review helps in your choice."
1,Not even interesting,"This is the worst video purchase I have EVER made. I truly wasted by money! It was not even the least bit informative or entertaining. Although I would love to get my money back, I know it is utterly impossible. I would not recommend that anyone ever buy this mess. Thanks a lot."
3,Meat Loaf with Extra Gravy,"On the whole an entertaining read but Leaming's gossip-column style and unabashed idolatry grate before long. Leaming saves her best prose not for Welles' legendary charm or artistic genius, but for his various appendages. ""The only way to make the plane was to hitchhike,"" Leaming writes, ""but when Orson extended the long tapered thumb of his extraordinarily beautiful hand, the only vehicle to stop was a garbage truck, into which Welles and company promptly crowded."" Such flourishes, as well as the index, which is surprisingly clever--under Welles, (George) Orson there is an entry entitled ""false noses used by 350, 353, 401, 424"" are the gravy on this meat loaf of a book. Eat up!"
3,"The Autobiography of Orson Welles, genius or madman!","Orson Welles was a genius of a film director, actor, producer, writer, and anything else he wanted to do but it didn't mean that he wasn't difficult. On the contrary, his genius may have allowed him to be a difficult man in real life. Even though he left an enormous legacy in his films, he was the master and is still regarded by directing one of the most highly regarded films in cinema history, Citizen Kane, loosely based on Randolph William Hearst and his life. Barbara Leaming's biography is more towards praising him while he was still alive rather than berating his behavior at times. This biography might be the kindest of Orson Welles around. While there are other books about Welles, this book is well worthy of reading anyway. Orson Welles was a remarkable man whose legacy can never really be outdone."
5,My Coffee Tastes Good Again,"I have a small Cuisinart 4 cup coffee maker with the metal carafe. After having 2 Cuisinart 12 cups, bite the dust in less than 6 months. I had to rely on what I considered my little back up. I refuse to buy another Cuisinart 10-12 cup again, unless they bring the manufacturing back to the USA.But, I digress. My little metal carafe was black from coffee stain, and no amount of Dawn and scrubbing would get it clean looking. I purchased the Dip it, filled my little carafe with boiling hot water and added the Dip It. 20 Minutes later the water was pitch black when I poured it out, but my little carafe was clean, all the stain was gone.Made a pot of coffee right after it was cleaned, I'd forgotten how good coffee can taste."
4,"Love this stuff, but....","I love this stuff...it cleans percolators and makes them look like the day they came out of the box. The only problem is that the stuff is clumped and hard when I receive it, and I have to take a knife to it to separate the powder crystals, which can get really messy..."
1,"Dip-It Food and Beverage Stain Cleaner Powder, 5 Ounce (Page of 8)","I gave this product one star because I haven't use it yet. Hopefully, it will clean as well as it claims."
5,Best thing to remove coffee stains from your pot,"We bought a new coffee maker that came with a stainless steel carafe. After six months or so, the insides started getting dark no matter how many times we washed it. My wife tried vinegar and a bottle brush which helped a little. I remembered a product called ""Dip-it"" my mother used to use. I looked in grocery stores, department stores and specialty stores. No one had heard of it. I should have gone to Amazon.Com first.Following the directions on the box and letting the carafe soak for about 1/2 hour, it was spotless, like a brand new pot. I'm glad I opted to buy a box of 8.

1,Just use Cascade,I couldn't find this locally and thought it was pretty pricey if ordered through Amazon. So I just followed another commenter's suggestion and used two tablespoons of Cascade powder dishwasher detergent. It worked great. My percolator is bright and shiny.
1,old product--past shelf date,The contents of all the boxes were molded together; it was impossible to pour as a powder These boxes must have sat in a warehouse for years before being shipped. I went out and purchased the same product from a local grocery store and it was perfect. The powder poured from the box like water.
1,Don't buy it unless you're looking for an art book,"This book is an art book, like the kind you can buy at art galleries. It reviews the inspiration the kimono had to modern American art. I wasted $50 canadian on this book because I thought it would be an invaluable reference for Kimono making. It's not. If you're an art teacher or student who is absolutely IN NEED of an art book on kimono art, then by all means purchase this book. If you aren't, then don't."
1,Bastardization of a beautiful garment,"This book takes the beauty of the traditional kimono and turns it into an abomination as ""art to wear"". The kimono already IS art to wear. It doesn't need to be dragged down by modernization.But that is not my only problem with this book. In the history section, written by Toshiki Wada, the editing is so bad that spelling mistakes are made and repeated. Also, Miss Wada needs to pick up a history book sometime very soon. Her grasp on the history of Japanese clothing is tenuous at best and the more bad history sections she writes (like this one and the one in ""Shibori""), the more misinformation she disseminates to the English-speaking public.Ignore any historical information on the kimono written or ""edited"" by Wada. Go out and buy Dalby instead."
4,Spenser's back!,"Good dialog and plot -- and it's reassuring to know Spenser's world is pretty much the same (even Pearl is not older), but although Hawk gets a mention, he is not involved, and a Spenser tale without Hawk is just not as enjoyable."
4,Parker beyond Spencer,"It is almost too easy to settle into Robert Parker's Spencer novels - a stolid, principled, tough and totally self sufficient PI with plenty of action and even some insight into the human condition. Not, however, particularly real. The surprisingly, pleasingly, first person feminine perspective has allowed Parker to explode the shell of imperviousness of Spencer's and seems to have liberated him to discuss the true nature of the common struggle. People live with contridictions and compromises and there is no such thing as the clear path to happiness. His protagonist ""Sunny"" is so much more complex and real than Spencer (tho I love Spencer and Hawk dearly). Sunny is imperfect, physically unimposing, non-self-sufficient and a completely captivating and exciting protagonist. ""Life is a bitch, and you work around it."" Classic Parker - but sharper, closer to home. A great read and a step forward for one of my favorite authors."
2,I knew Spenser; Sunny Randall is no Spenser,"Something to pass the time if there's nothing else around to read, otherwise ... dear Mr. Parker, please go back to being yourself. Sunny Randall is a bore."
3,Rather have Spenser back,"I did not care that much for Sunny Randall. It strikes me that she would like to be just like Spenser when she grows up, but will probably never get there. The story line falls to closely to some of Parker's other novels. Were I not a die hard Spenser fan, I might have liked it better. If James Bond does not have to get old, neither does Spenser. I would also welcome another Jesse Stone book with more development of that character."
1,A big disappointment,"The only thing I'm happy about is that I got this book from the library and didn't pay for it. It was the worst book I've ever read. I finished it because I couldn't believe it was as boring and shallow as it was and thought, hoped it might change. Some men can write from a woman's point of view, but this author cannot or did not in this book. I feel he wrote it while watching a crime drama on TV. Nothing new, interesting. The dialogue was the most trivial and boring I've ever read in a book. The characters were flat, shallow and full of the Boston cynicism that is reason I left Boston. All the softness, love and caring was focussed on the dog. People are afraid to show themselves. I wouldn't want to meet any of the characters or the author!"
3,Spenser had a Sex Change,"Okay, all true Parker fans know that he only knows how to write a couple kinds of characters. So I expected Sunny Randall to act and sound a lot like Spenser (and Jesse Stone, and Philip Marlowe in Parker's rendition of Raymond Chandler). I also expected a Hawk-like character; no one is fooled by the fact that Spike is white and gay. If that had been the only problem with this book, it would have been okay - Spenser and Hawk aren't bad characters to repeat. But the mystery was disappointing. Why is it assumed that all 15-year-old girls who run away from home are hooking? Or that her parents are to blame? Sunny takes these facts for granted, and it spoils the book's believability. Does anyone else recall poor April Kyle, rescued by Spenser in two different novels? Hey - maybe Sunny read those books too. Maybe they're required reading for a PI license in Boston. Come on, Mr. Parker - show us some imagination. We all believe you have one."
4,Spenser as played by Helen Hunt,"It read like a merger between the Spenser novelsEarly AutumnandCeremony, (especiallySpenser: Ceremony, since Spike sounds like the same one in the aforementioned TV movie) but spun it around by making Spenser a short blonde woman who only got into the business to pay the bills between painting sales. Setting it in the same universe as Spenser and Jesse Stone did make it entertaining, and made me wonder if Parker'll ever do a crossover between all three."
2,A female Spenser.,"It seems to me that all Parker did was give Spenser a sex change operation and name him/her Sonny. Save your money. The best thing about this book is the dog, Rosie, at least she's the one that Parker talks about the most. Give me Spenser, anyday."
3,Not Great,"Parker introduces a new character, only she's not new. It's Spenser as a short female PI. She has Spenser's sense of humor, but is deeply imbued with Susan Silverman's consuming self-interest. The woman are all selfish (...). And she spews cliches made popular by the many Spenser books preceding it. Event he story line is merely a rehash of Early Autumn (one of Parker's finest). All in all, a disappointment."
3,Not as comfortable as Spenser,"Parker's new detective, Sonny Randall, is a Boston Private Eye of the female persuasion. Her cryptic responses and abrasive manner do not amuse as would the same comments from Spenser or Hawk. Cohorts Spike and Richie are great new characters, but Sonny's enchantment with the adolescent runaway is unfathomable. The flattened affect and apathy generated by this juvenile would alienate a lesser being. Parental abuses and undoing are too contrived.. All in all, this is not as comfortable a read as Parker's customary endeavors. Furthermore, Rosie is no Pearl the Wonder Dog."
4,"Spenser, Jesse, now SUNNY???","I was a bit reluctant at first to pick this one up, but in the end I am glad I did. It's a quick read, some humorous moments and references to a 200lb boxer with a broken nose. The only thing wrong with the book is the lack of an original plot. If you're a fan of Robert Parker, by all means you must have this one in your library. If you're a first time Parker reader, after reading this book, pick up either ""Night Passage"" or if you want the same plot different main character, try ""Thin Air"". All in all, I look forward to see how Mr. Parker will develop Sunny Randall further."
3,Where is Karen Kijewski when you need her???,"Sunny is no Kat Colorado! I devour all of the Parker ""Spenser"" novels, delighting in his alliance with Hawk. The dialogue of those books is peerless, especially the repartee between those two. Sadly, Spike just does not cut it for me. Oh well. The theme of 'detective helps troubled teen' is getting a bit old as Parker has used this before and not much new is apparent. Maybe next time. (Karen K.-WHERE ARE YOU??}"
3,"spencer in a dress, same lines, same easy reading","Finished the book in less than 5 hours. Might as well be reading about spenser (spencer) sic, with hawk and Susan. Always good easy reading, a real no-brainer."
4,A Qualified Hooray ...,"After being disappointed by Sue Grafton since the letter ""F,"" it's great to have a new, savvy, wisecracking, female private eye on the scene. I devoured this book in one sitting.However, when Sunny Randall encores, I'm hoping Parker will be kind enough to grant us a plot line he hasn't used (and, re-used) in his past offerings.Summary: typical Parker: a quick read; fun and mildly humorous; character (rather than plot) driven; if you've read one, you've read them all."
3,Actually 3 1/2 stars!,"No matter what anyone say or writes, Robert Parker writes a romping fun story. Having a female leading character was enjoyable. I like her toughness, and her ability to handle rough situations with brains, using any available resource, from weapons to exhusband mafia family/pals. Don't let the similarities between Sunny and Spenser deter you from reading this. It was a fun read."
4,"Great Reading, Fast Action","This book was a fun summer book. The plot was quick and the action was fast pace. Finally a woman who is self- confident and entertaining.I like the idea that she had a little dog, and that she did not feel that she or any woman needed a man to complete her.I look forward to morebooks starting Sunny Randall."
4,Great summer fun,"Had to check the book jacket to make sure the author was of the male pursuasion,since he understands the female mind of his protagonist so well. No question, Parker is always a fun read, but this time around (you male readers may not understand this) he truly proves his skill. To step out of one's own skin and speak for a fictional character is the test and job of an author,but to accomplish this while stepping out of one's gender as well, shows extraordinary ability. Plus..it's a fun read,good story..let's hope for sequels."
4,Spenser in a dress!,"Usually, if I really love a series written by an author, I can't stand any of their other books or series. I'm not sure why that is, but it might have something to do with being bitter that they have spent time on something OTHER than the series that I so desperately love. However, Parker's newest is almost the same exact creation as Parker's oldest (Spenser). The protagonist is a PI in Boston who will work for free if the case merits the generosity. The protagonist also has the exact same sharp and witty personality as Spenser. The only real difference is that this new PI is a woman. And she can't cook. At all. Other than that, it's essentially a Spenser novel and man-oh-man does that make me happy. Two series for the price of one! Yahoo! So, if you're a Spenser fan, check it out. The plot is a LOT like one of the plots in an old Spenser novel, but who the heck cares? It's great!"
4,"All the essential charm, wit and grit--Parker delivers!","Parker delivers a story with all the charm, wit, and grit one expects from his writing. It's not a Spencer novel but you'll forget all about that once you ""get to know"" Sunny, Richie, Spike, and Rosie. No one writes a mystery that's as much fun and exciting to read as Robert B. Parker!"
3,"Spenser-ette, recycled plot, but still amusing","Yes, Sunny is Spenser. Yes, the plot is familiar. Yes, Sunny is not much of a lady. Yes Bobby B. is capitalizing on the Woman Sleuth craze. Yes, it's a blatant attempt to get Spenser on screen again (if Helen Hunt rumors are true).But it is sufficiently different and well-written to be worth reading instead of re-reading the earlier Spenser. Especially out of the library (sorry Amazon)."
3,"Good Book, but it made me miss Spenser","Family honor was a good book. Robert Parker is one of my favorite authors, so I dug right into this book. About halfway through, I thought that I was reading Early Autumn, especiallly when I got to the ""Push-up"" scene. But it is fast read, and I enjoyed it. I only wish he had written a Spenser novel instead. The thought of Tony Marcus without Hawk there to heckle him, or the serious need for Millicent to see Susan made me quite wistful for good ol' Spenser."
3,"Snappy dialog, but carbon copy Parker plot","Written with the usual Parker style, but isn't this the same plot as the one where Spenser rescued Paul Giacommin? Instead of Hawk we get Spike, who avoids being pure white bread by being gay. A female hero who sounds and acts a lot like Spenser with a few twists to let us know she's a girl (she cries after blowing one of the bad guys away). She lifts weights, boxes, shoots, cooks, philosophizes, etc., etc., etc. Let's get a little more diversity here!"
3,"Enjoyable, slightly below-average Parker","Sunny Randall is Spenser in drag, with the exception that when things get rough, she calls on her male friends to come in and provide the machismo. Despite one good scene when she goes up against a tough pimp, she's still too heavily dependent upon her ex for this to be truly enjoyable; Parker's sexism is too glaring. Nonetheless, it is about as enjoyable as any Parker novel: it's mental popcorn, meant to be consumed & forgotten."
2,"NO MORE SUNNY RANDALL, PLEASE","I have read every Spencer book written by Parker and both Jessie Stone books. I enjoyed them all, some more than others but as a whole I like all of them. I even keep them and read some more than once, which is rare for me. Now comes Sunny Randall. It is the worst thing I have read that Parker wrote. All about a privite eye who finds a fifteen year old for her parents and then decides to not take her home until she can find out why she ran away. Sunny uses her ex-husbands mob family to get her into places and to see people she cannot do by her self. Spike is the answer to Spencers Hawk, I guess. I had to force my self to finish the book. I understand there is another Sunny Randall out in Hardback, guess who WON'T be buying it. I know Robert Parker could care less what I think if this book, but, I wish he would stick to the Spencer books which he does so well. This is about the same as Spencer and Paul in Thin Air. The names have changed but not much else."
2,Vapid and vacuous,The main character was insufferable. Parker has tried to create a male Spencer but fails miserably. She appears to be without fault and has an answer for everything. At least Spencer admits to feet of clay. The plot was implausible.
4,Like one of the better old Spenser novels,"Robert B. Parker 's Spenser novels have gotten stuck in a rut, a result of needing to keep the storylines consistent with the characters' past history. I continue to read them avidly, but they seem a little stale.All he has done here is to keep the same basic cast characters but change their names, genders, ethnicities, and sexual orientations. This simple gimmick actually works quite well.""Family Honor"" reads and feels just like a Spenser novel--a fresh, rejuvenated Spenser novel, like the ones he was writing a decade ago. It's like seeing the same group of actors in a new sitcom after a few too many years of seeing them in the old one."
2,Spenser in drag?,"Really, this is Parker's male persona stuffed into a petite female form. It was like reading Spenser as a weird female impersonator. This may have been my own limitation as a reader, after enjoying so many ""Spenser"" novels -- but it was frankly unsettling and unsavory. Yuck."
4,First Time Parker Reader...I'll be back,This is the first book I have read by this author and I really enjoyed it. I see a large number of people who have read his other titles were a little disappointed in Family Honor so I am looking forward to reading the other titles that are supposed to be better.
2,Formulaic and uninspired.,"I was disappointed in Family Honor. Yes it reads like a Spenser novel, is kind of a fun read if you're a Spenser fan (which I am), but here Parker takes out his Spencer cookie cutter and plops out a rather uninspired story. Nothing new here. If you like Parker -- his best novel is Love and Glory, which isn't a Spenser novel, but an excellent story."
2,Self-plagiarism by Parker,"You have to kind of respect the size of the cojones on Robert Parker to put out this book. Not only is the main character Spenser with breasts, but she has her own tough-guy sidekick like Spenser, her own cute dog like Spenser, and the relationship with her boyfriend ends up exactly like Spencer's and Susan's. What makes Parker the winner of the chutzpah award is the fact that the PLOT of the book is the same as the Spenser novel ""Early Autumn""! I give this 2 stars because if you've never read any Spenser books it's a pretty decent read, but if you're a fan of the series, this is just Spenser rehashed."
5,So what?,"Okay, ditto on the Spencer/Stone/Parker fan interested to see how he handles a female heroine. Okay, ditto on the similarities between Spencer/Sunny, right down to the dog. But to it all I say a resounding so what? By the end of the book, I was so interested and attached to Sunny, Richie, Spike, Brian, Millicent, and ever her mother, I didn't care! So, write on, Robert (all puns intended)! Long may you type!!"
5,"Parker's back, full throttle!","The best Parker I've read in ages, tho even his lesser books are great fun. Sunny is sharp, wise, funny, tough - the writing sings, and the character descriptions made me laugh. I'd rank this right up there with the best Spenser (Early Autumn, Looking for Rachel Wallace). Parker is back in touch with his twinkle, and his love of women -and at the peak of his form. Best in genre I've read in years."
2,A rehash of Parker's Spenser novels.,"Robert B. Parker writes captivating, exciting prose. Unfortunately, he has already written this one. This book is a rehash of ""Early Automn"", with chunks of ""Ceremony"" thrown in. Don't waste your money."
2,THE MOST UN-CHICK LIKE WOMAN I HAVE EVER HEARD OF,"Seems like i've read this story before in a Spenser novel. Disguising the detective as a woman didn't fool me, and I don't think it'll fool many others. And Sunny was completely unbelievable. Although, RB Parker did manage to make her into a male fantasy: gorgeous, perfect body, guilt-free casual sex, completely self-assured...yeah right. Haven't met too many of hose."
1,Woops,"Yeah, I am a big fan of moby, and accidentally buying the CD that almost ended his career doesn't shake that, if you want some good Moby might I suggest 18 or Play, this has some quiet more ambient tracks which show some promise, but fail to build up to anything, everything else is Moby screaming in a traditional punk style, which were almost humorous, except, not [this much money] humorous, I am not a fan of this CD, I know he was starting out in a punk band, but his other stuff is much better"
4,AWESOME & IT ROCKS,"this record is so good! I have listened to it over 100 times in its entirety, and I'm not tired of it! Its a departure from his other music, but it definitely lives up to the creative genius that Moby is known for. I love Moby, and all of his records, to me he can do no wrong. ANIMAL RIGHTS ROCKS!"
2,Jack of all trades=master of none,"This CD would give me a headache even if the band had more talent and better material to work with. After all, why do I need to buy a CD to hear a mixture of classical-sounding elevator music, new-age sounding melodies, Pearl Jam-esque grunge, and screaming cuss-metal? I could buy individual CDs with each genre for when it suited my mood. Listen to all of them intermingled is annoying and not at all entertaining. If they had made one great song in the bunch they might be worthy of a small helping of forgiveness, but they couldn't even manage that."
5,The very best of Moby...if you are not the usual Moby fan.,"If you are not interested in the dull, grey, median, this cd is for you. Moby is flirting with the edges of the extreme, from trashy songs like Someone To Love and Heavy Flow to songs that are themselves a mix like Say It's All Mine towards the more usual Moby stuff. A pity most Moby fans don't like this.I don't see him do better than this ever..."
4,Moby goes Metal!!!!!!!!!!!!!!,"Rare, very rare piece in Moby s catalogue, in the days were Animal Rigths were recorded Moby stated that he left listening techno and electronic music for a while and started to listen Metal and Hard and wanted to do something different , the final result is this collection of tracks loaded of dense sounds, chaotic vocals and adrenaline, recordings are not overproduced, you can even somethimes listen strings scratch , static sound , and echoes that reflect some lack of care in the details but you can be certain that all this is part of the album concept and sound, that have the intention to own a dirty and jamming atmosphere, please check ""thats when i reach for my revolver"", Animal Rigths would be definitelly the only album i recommend from the descendent of the author of Moby DickHM"
3,Different,"This album is really different from the traditional ambient Moby everyone is used to. There is a lot of screaming from Moby and a lot more bass-guitar than you would expect.It wasn't a really good album for me. I've listened to Play and 18 numerous times, but I will probably not listen to this again."
4,Hard rock meets ambient,"Listening to the song 'Alone' right now compels me to write this review. If nothing, buy this CD only for this track. A 10-minute long epic ambient composition. Showcases the genius that Moby is. There are several other very good songs on this album. This album is predominantly hard/punk rock with some softer ambient pieces sparsed in between. Most people know Moby for his work on techno and ambient music, but here Moby shows his versatility by doing an equally good job with hard rock. Many of the songs have him screaming at the top of his voice, but rest assured, they are still good and not average hard/punk rock music. Again, Moby shows that he doesn't go by what sells. Rather he goes by his artistic instinct and likes to experiment with different genres of music.Most of Moby's works are highly underrated and misunderstood. This is one of them. Moby's music is intelligent music. Unfortunately, not many people can understand or appreciate that."
5,I love this one,"This is the perfect marriage of heavy and soft via Moby. Who knew that the little electronica man had metal in him?It's amazing, and remains my favorite Moby album by far. ""Face It"" is the best!"
3,Animal Rights,"Most may be considering this album after buying (and obviously liking) Moby's `Play'. A word of caution then. It's completely different - bar the last 2 tracks. `Animal Rights' is more Nine Inch Nails than Groove Armada. Yet, for those who like rock music in the vein of melodic punk - like, for example, Nirvana - will appreciate this (many in fact prefer this to `Play'). `Face It', `Soft' and `That's When I Reach For My Revolver' are the standout tracks. `Animal Rights' truly marks Moby out as a musical chameleon."
3,As titled but not what I wanted,"I was looking for a more how to, step by step book. This did not help men. I gave it away."
3,Cool,"I bought the cd. Its has all of the songs I wanted, but the Amazon site has incorrect information. The correct cd titles in the correct order for the Power Ballads CD is (This is printed on the cd & cd cover):Every Rose Has It's Thorn-PoisonWhen I See You Smile-Bad EnglishHigh Enough-Damn YankeesIs This Love-WhitesnakeMore Than Words-ExtremeSister Christian-Night RangerDon't Know What You Got (Till It's Gone)-CinderellaI'll See You In My Dreams-GiantStill Loving You-ScorpionsCat's In the Cradle-Ugly Kid JoeJust Between You and Me-April WineFly to the Angels-SlaughterLike I said, that is how it is printed on the cd and cd cover and those are the correct songs on the cd."
1,Poor Quality.,The seat covers started coming loose at the seams immediately upon putting them on the seats.
5,Great Series and Great Author,I have enjoyed every book written by David Moody and the whole Autumn Series is awesome. He does a great job writing about human reactions to desperate situations and if your tired of happy endings then you will love any book by David Moody.
3,not impressed,"product does not get absorbed well, if you tend to have mixed dry and greasy hair this is not for you."
2,No fatal flaws on this one,"We bought two dashmats on Amazon for two different cars. The other one was so badly done we had to send it back. This one only had one flaw, a silly 1""x6"" flap that was mis-sewn and hung wrong. No matter how long you let it sit, it would never look right. We folded it under and now the dashmat looks ok. Maybe cut it off someday and resew the piping to make it look like a professional job.As I've said in another review, Dashmat products we ordered on Amazon don't seem to be the quality they once were. I'm looking at other brands from now on."
1,Awful,The Call is set to Carnival music and is simply irritating. The scenes are disturbing (for example a fly eating someone's head). It is also dull. I was neither entertained nor inspired by this. I wouldn't watch the video again if someone paid me to view it. It is a shame to get a video and immediately throw it away.
1,I got it to work and still hated it.,"I have a Nokia 5190 from Cingular and eagerly ordered this unit. Cingular charged me a flat rate of $... a month just for datalink service, and then minutes on top of that, but that's not too expensive for wireless internet access.I got it installed and running in about 45 minutes and proceeded to try it out. I got so annoyed with the speed, the bulky cable, the connect time (~30 to 40 seconds) and the intermittent service, that I gave up and returned it.Don't bother."
1,Do NOT buy,"If I could give it zero stars, I would. Plain and simple, it doesn't work. I plugged the unit into my Visor Deluxe, connected the cable to my Nokia, tried connecting and received the error message ""No dial tone."" It also seems to crash my phone in that half of the time it tries to connect, my phone ends up shutting off.The Xircom website has little by the means of support for this product and nothing specifically addressing this issue of not connecting, let alone crashing the phone.I've spent nearly an hour looking for support manuals and trying to connect without luck. The only review I can find on this product is one here on Amazon. I would also like to make an observation: this product is not listed on the Handspring website, nor at PalmGear. What does this say for the product?All in all, a huge disappointment."
1,I'd give it more stars if it worked!,"Well, the module seems to install just fine (make sure you move Mobilelink into flash or you'll crash your unit). I'm trying to use mine my color Prism. The only problem is that my Nokia 5190 doesn't want to cooperate, so I still haven't surfed with this thing yet. I get a ""Check Operator Services&quit; error on the screen of my Nokia, and it disconnects. Even so, I bought it because it was a lot cheaper than a wireless web module (hey, why buy the wireless hardware again - it's already in my phone), and I avoid a [monthly] charge for service. I just use my cell phone minutes, which is fine for brief email uploads/downloads. We'll see what happens to my cell phone bill once I get sucked into online surfing of the PDA-enabled websites. So, once I get around to calling Xircom for some help, I'll report back on this thing actually works."
2,GSM Phones,"Alot of stuff for Nokia is GSM only. Pull off your battery, and take a look at your Nokia phone. The older phones that alot of people carry is TDMA/CDMA, like the 5185. Guess what? It dosen't work."
4,the best rock ever,you must buy this album if you like rock it's got every thing you could ever want from van halen to the darknessclick on the following link for free downloads of this albumhttp://www.outwar.com/page.php?x=1902610
4,A Vintage Masterpiece,"While somewhat outdated, The Life and Times of Jesus the Messiah remains a magnificent reference to the historical and cultural setting to the days of Jesus of Nazareth. Although written some 70 years prior to the discovery of the Dead Sea Scrolls, Edersheim's great work still offers highly valuable information and insight on the Gospels and related events. One of the more striking features of the book is the appendix list of 400+ Old Testament passages which were tagged by the ancient rabbis as being messianically applied. An absolute must for anyone who wish to study the Jewish expectations of the Messiah surrounding the days when the Nazarene Carpentar walked the Earth. Place this vintage masterpiece in your library, and you will find yourself going back to it time and time again."
3,"Dense info, dated style, lots of typos","1. Lots of information on early Judaism, carefully footnoted from primary sources. In the footnotes, lots of arguments with other scholars, chiefly German (as was typical in the late nineteenth century). Some of author's weighing of evidence will have been challenged in the 100+ years since this book was first published, and new sources will have been discovered; new archaeological sites too. But this is still a good starting-point, if only for the quantity of early sources that are collected in one place.2. Florid prose.3. This reprint edition has more than the usual number of typographical errors. Most of these are harmless, but sometimes they change the sense. E.g., on p. 304: ""We are _not_ in some measure prepared to follow the worship on that Sabbath in Nazareth"" should read ""We are _now_ in some measure prepared..."""
4,typos galore!,"I do not intend to review content here. This new edition is so full of typographical errors that sometimes the reader will have to intuit what the author really wrote. It is clear that the proofreaders of this edition were not actually reading; they were simply following the little red lines under the ""misspelled"" words. This has resulted in some truly bizarre apparent statements by the author, unreproducible here due to copyright laws. Disclaimer-- I have not purchased this book, merely checked it out of the library."
4,"Good book, hard to reference","Alfred Edersheim is a scholar of unique perspective. He was born and raised a Jew but converted to Christianity as a young man. He provides insight into Jewish history and background to the gospel narratives like no one else I've read. A couple of problems with this work though, it can be very hard to reference. When searching for a particular parable or passage you have to search through the chapter headings one by one to see if you recognize the content. Furthermore, Mr. Edersheim is so unbelievably wordy it can be frustrating waiting for him to get to the point, but this is typical of late 19th and early 20th century biblical expositors. Overall this is a must in any self-respecting theologian's library."
2,Not the complete work,"This edition is not the complete text. It is only Volume 1 of 2 volumes, and only covers through the feeding of the 5000."
4,Reference,"This is a very big book. It's more a reference book than I was expecting. I think it will be very good, but I was surprised at the size."
4,works well on the proper shoe,"A great product, but you need to put it on the proper shoe. If you use it on shoes with a closed toed, your toes can no longer fit comfortably inside as this product is considerably thick. It works best with shoes that have lots of toe wiggle room, such as heeled sandals. I put it on my sandals that have a very well-worn toe bed, and it's extended the lifetime of my well used shoes. Make sure to clean your shoe and let it dry before apply the product (such as with a bacteria killing surface cleansing wipe), and it should help it stick better. I haven't had any problems with it peeling off."
5,Excellent product,"If you are like me and hate your foot slipping to the front of the shoe, this product is for you. It also provides extra cushioning and works with pumps, peep toe, sandals, boots and sneakers mary jane style. I've used it for years and so far no complaints!!!! This product is available at drug stores but a much higher price (between $6.99 and $10.99). For me the affordability offered through Amazon is the cherry on top!! I recommend this product!!"
2,Profoot Toes Beds,Profoot Toes Beds weren't what I expected. Couldn't get them to stay on. They kept off in my shoe. They didn't protect my toes at all.
2,Toe Beds,"Toe beds are too narrow for most peoples' feet, and also too thin. Metatarsal pads are OK, but toe bed should be much thicker to cushion toes."

4,EXCELLENT,"EXCELLENT BOOK, RECIPES ARE WELL WRITTEN AND EASY TO FOLLOW. RESULTS SO FAR HAVE BEEN GREAT.LACKS ONLY PICTURES OF THE END RESULTS. YOU WILL HAVE TO USE YOU IMAGINATION UNTIL YOU HAVE MADE IT."
2,Never made it off the ground.,"I will give it 2 stars because the characters were likeable; however, the plot never did catch my interest. Also, there were several sub-plots that were thrown in that made it confusing.What was the deal with Catriona's uncle and his mysterious assistant? This was some other story entirely. Does the author intend a sequel? Also, Catriona's brother had some serious problems including a missing child who was later found. Again, this was another story. Even if there is a sequel that might explain, I am not interested enough to read them. Sorry."
2,It's okay.,"The hero is quite nice, but the heroine is a bit too odd sometimes. The repartee between them is good and there are steamy love scenes. But the secondary characters are weak or unintentionally creepy and the ""magic"" is silly, dragging the story down.A very mixed bag. If I'd read it more recently, I might actually lower the rating."
3,Romantic but too superficial...,"I thought the romance between Knight and Catriona was very sweet, especially when they were ""practice dancing"" in the ballroom. I also loved his friend, Wendell. But his sister, Olivia was supposed to be so nice and she was to a degree, but she was out-of-line many times with her ""opinions"" in Knight's house. Good lord, she was like an annoying mother hen to him. The guy couldn't turn around in his own house without his sister and his servants waiting in the wings to berate him. I didn't really care for Catriona's uncle, Murdo. Truth be told, he gave me the creeps. I did like Lamont Montgomery, although I could never figure out if he was supposed to be a good guy or a bad guy. I found that annoying in the extreme, I guess because I liked him and I wasn't sure if I was supposed to like him. The author never made it clear."
5,Excellent book for history buffs and sci-fi fans,"Harry Turtledove, master of alternate history, shows his flair for writing with this tome. This book shows what would have occurred had aliens attacked the Earth during World War II. Turtledove's grasp of history shines through with his treatment of major figures (FDR, Churchill, etc.) and weapons. Among the strange things that occur (and they are legion) is a British bombing raid protected by GERMAN fighters. In this first of the Worldwar series, the aliens attack and the Earth desperately tries to unite to repel the otherworldly invaders. Read this book."
3,Kindle edition contains many errors,Worldwar: In the BalanceThe book was great but the kindle edition contains ALOT of editing errors that really should not exist considering the pricing. Moat of the Turtledove books I have read on the kindle suffer from the same problem.
4,"Great book, but a little hard to follow","The first 50 pages of the book pulled me into the story, but after that the book became a little hard to follow. I had to read it twice before I got the hang of it. Other than that, this is a very entertaining and interesting sci-fi novel, based on a very original idea."
1,Never been so disappointed by a good concept gone wrong,"The concept for this series is great, but it's done really badly, without going into details all the main characters are Jews who can do no wrong and everyone else is a belligerent fool, I was looking forward to a good military sci-fi and instead got what reads like political propaganda."
3,four volumes of this?,"I think as sci fi goeshe is kind of obvious sometimes.His history is interesting at times.I don't know that as even as good at plot and characterization and historyas Harry Turtledove is that I want to read the other volumes...For me he is just too transparent.I might sample some of his other sci fi in the future.The Aliens are xenophobic in many ways, and the technology is obviously at an improved level of our current technology.We couldn't mount a mission to another star like this:it is doubtful these Aliens could either."
4,fan of alternate endings and alike.,"this books was pretty good, it certainly filled the need i felt. some of the characters situations are a little boring and are not developed to well. but the story is great, when i read it i look at it like a modern day army fighting a wwII army. technology of the lizards is about what our technology is now, so that make's it interesting. it's not the best he could have made it but it is definitely worth reading, it can become addictive which is good, i recommend it."
2,Overrated,This book is overrated by a longshot. If I didn't know any better I could swear that this book wasn't even edited! Turtledove has 50 things going on at once! There are too many characters and too little continuity. I would recommend this book to anyone who has insomnia.
4,Master of what if,"I had never read Turtledove until this book. The premiss of the story grabbed me; What if, during the height of WWII an armada from another star system invaded Earth? The only reason I gave it four stars is because Turtledove tends to get a little wordy. Harry Turtledove is definitely the Master of ""What if""."
1,Good idea. Bad book.,"Having read the last three books (couldn't find the first) I kept expecting it to get better. It didn't. It was an excelent idea but are all Germans really evil? Are all English and Americans really good? There were so many subplots it was hard to keep track of what was going on. Each subplot was mentioned in each chapter and many had nothing to do with the main plot. Made you wonder why they were written other that to just fill paper.Turtledove missed a good opportunity here to write a classic science fiction novel. He would have been better off to mention his idea to someone else and let them write a 600 page novel than meander through 2400 pages himself.Yup, still read three of the four books and he is spending the royalies he made off me!"
4,Good start to the series,"I've read a couple of Harry Turtledove's excellent short stories, so I knew I was in for a treat when I started reading. Other than a couple of minor slowdowns in the plot, it does make me want to get the next book in the series."
4,How about those Tosevites!,"I happened to read WorldWar:In The Balance right after reading the new WWII novel The Triumph and the Glory, and it was very interesting to compare Turtledove's speculative fiction about the war with Rustad's superb historical fiction novel. Anyway, In The Balance was fascinating, although perhaps a little long."
3,"A fairly decent cross between ""V"" and ""Winds Of War""","Herman Wouk's ""Winds Of War"" and A.C. Crispin's ""V"" are a couple of my favorite books, but it never occurred to me anyone might fuse the two concepts. Imagine World War II interrupted by an invasion from outer space! The trick is not to expect the level of writing of Wouk or Crispin. The arrogance of the invaders makes you want to say ""aw come on"" at times, plus there's a bit of a John Wayne aspect to many of the heroes (""aw come on"" yet again). Plus, you have to have a tolerance for long-format fiction. All in all, not too shabby. I ordered both of Turtledove's Civil War titles before I'd gotten through the second of the four volumes. Gather what you will from that."
2,Not so original - Not so engaging,"I can't understand why anyone would give this book five stars. Three stars- sure- four -maybe. But five? Come on. From my perspective, this book was pretty boring and unoriginal. The ""Lizards"" are supposed to be so different but their society seems more Japanese than extra-terrestrial. They are also kinder than most human invaders. I find that implausible. Also, is anyone else tired of the ""You humans are the most original, innovative race in the galaxy"" spiel? I'd like to read a book where humans are nothing special. I also did not appreciate the gratuitous sex scenes. Ick."
4,"Captivating, but not earthshaking...","...Several of the characters have acted out of character onseveral occasions. The rapid onset of bitterness and apathy in severalwas unfathomable. How Mr. Trutledove got from here to there was a mystery.The social conditioning of the Lizards is rigid and ingrained and expressed over and over, but the third in command is constantly insubordinate, and the obedience taught to hatchlings is often conveniently forgotten. For such an endeavor, these minor indiscretions would be merely disconcerting, but with such a huge cast, they quickly crumple characters and continuity.I will continue on with the series. The Guns of The South showed what Mr. Turtledove can do!"
2,Great book. NOT a great e-book.,"The price of the e-book is the same as the paperback; $7.99. However, with the e-book, there's no cost for printing, shipping, storing, etc. Apparently, Random House decided that they weren't making *enough* money, and skipped the proofreader too.The e-book is filled with typographical errors, autocorrect bugs, and paragraphs that end in mid-sentence (really!). If you like Turtledove, read the paperback; it's excellent. However, the e-book is painful."
2,Poor Quality,"As mentioned by another reviewer, this Kindle edition is plagued by OCR errors. Missing apostrophes, added commas, odd capitalization.we know the publisher has a perfect computer file of this book. How hard would it be to use that as the basis for the Kindle edition? Sloppy workmanship."
3,"Good 600 page start, but won't keep me going for 1800 more","Turtledove writes a good page-turner. As many other reviewers have already commented, the characters are a bit flat and often stereotyped. The technology that the invaders bring is not logical nor is the way that they employ it. All that said, it is entertaining. There's not much more fun than beating superior space aliens using only our raw courage and ingenuity.If you're looking for history or hard science-fiction, this is not a good choice. If you are willing to commit to a 2,400 page series and you like this sort of thing, it is fun."
3,You MUST read ONE book in this series,"I really enjoyed reading the first book in this series, but subsequent books were repetitive. The research that obviously went into it makes for genuine characters, and the insight into humanity as seen through the eyes of an alien species is humorous, at times. But don't bother to read the whole series. I'm starting the 4th book now, and I haven't really gotten anything new out of the 2nd or 3rd book.But don't get me wrong. I really liked the first book."
2,"Slow, slow, slow. Not up to the hype.","I finally gave in and purchased the first novel of the 'Worldwar' series. A disappointment, to say the least. The premise was original, and Tutledove gives interesting insight into the military capabilities of the era... but it never quite took off."
5,A MUST READ FOR EVERYONE,"Being a WWII buff I was in the bookstore one day picking up books about WWII that I thought might be good reading. When I got home and looked at the cover of WORLD WAR: IN THE BALANCE I saw the words ""alternate history"". That's when I said to myself ""OH NO!, What kind of silly book did I manage to pick up this time?"". When I started reading it though I became so captivated that I literally couldn't put it down till I finished it. I was so addicted that I had to read TILTING THE BALANCE, then I had to read UPSETTING THE BALANCE, and finally I had to read STRIKING THE BALANCE. The worst part is waiting for the sequel books to arrive after you've ordered them if you've already finished reading the first one. Excellent reading, and highly reccommended to all people as a must read...."
4,An interesting view of WWII tech vs alien invasion,"Turtledove creates a story of how humanity of the WWII era deals with the technology of the future. His descriptions of people are believable and moving, and yet, the fact that hisaliens seem so standard takes away from the story. Aliens are slow of thought, reptilian, and use technology scarcely betterif at all than that of our own era. It is worth reading if you enjoy the genre, but it is not one to use to introduce others to the subject."
1,Glacially slow and annoyingly repetitious.,"The basic idea for this series was pretty good. Even in Turtledove's hack writer clutches, it should have yielded a decent book. Padded, stretched and drawn out over multiple volumes, it is an utter waste of time. Turtledove must have been getting paid by the word."
2,Another good idea gets drawn into a 4 book contract - UGH,"A fantastic idea. Some good action scenes. A bit of good writing. But, once again, a story that would have been GREAT as a single long book, is dragged into infinte boredom. How many times will the aliens tell us that they thought the natives of Earth were going to be primitive? How many times is the same plot re-hashed over and over? This is one of only a few books that I've found myself actually skipping huge chunks of text. To be fair, perhaps hopes were set in the wrong direction - I wanted to read a great Sci-Fi book. Perhaps this was catering to those who love 'war-epic' genre. If so, then this book may be for you. I didn't hate the book, I just found myself wishing the story would move much much faster. Instead, I continually found myself saying, ""Oh no, not this group again, I wish we could get back to the aliens, or at least the war itself."" Save your money and your time, this just wasn't worth the pain of going through."
1,Not believeable,"I found the characters including the historical ones to be unbelieveable. I don't think some of the historical figures would have acted as they did. The aliens are naive beyond belief. They just don't seem that bright. I don't think they could successfully invade my grandmother's kitchen. The aliens can somehow cross lightyears of space, but their technology doesn't seem to be more advanced then that shown in the Gulf War. A worthy attempt at an alternative history that just falls flat. I don't think I'll bother finishing this series. Try Harry Harrison's East of Eden for a great alternative history."
1,Couldn't wait for it to end,"The idiotic plot moves at a glacial pace, and the characterizations are laughable. The book's multinational cast of characters is composed largely of ridiculous cultural stereotypes."
2,"Excessive, painful, unnecessary","The lady and three gentlemen make every effort to reaffirm the populist cliché of Beethoven the Madman. Perhaps this is a small triumph in itself. Beethoven's sadistic (perhaps also masochistic?) outbursts make for a heavy meal even on paper and with this new recording the shock value is doubled by the use of period instruments and playing techniques. It is a sawing of the most cruel kind. The amount of discomfort brought by listening to the op. 135 quartet can compare to, say, post-Stockhausen trauma. Or perhaps Elliot Carter. Or any number of last century's modernist pricks. Eroica Quartet seem to be advancing boldly into the 19th century quartet repertoire (next victim is Florestan himself!). I say, keep your hands off my Brahms!"
4,A Journey with St. Mugg,"It has been over twenty years now since this gentle testament first aired but it has lost none of it's freshness or vitality. Muggeridge was a prolific writer journalist who in the later part of his life became something of a christian apologist in rather a C.S. Lewis way. It is interesting that both men still have much to say to our present problems.This Film is a kind of meditation for Muggeridge on his life, modern life and the relevance of the spiritual truths that Jesus taught for these things. We see and hear Mr. Muggeridge as he speaks of these things in his pastoral home in England and then In the Holy Lands (most notably the biblical wilderness and the sea of Galilee). It is very enjoyable to share these things with him and we ourselves can then bring our own vistas(inner and outer) to his , a very enjoyable thing to do. A sort of meditation between his own and ours.I liked the film which I found pleasant to the eye and spirit."
3,The camera was defected,"I bought the camera from ATN Electronic, please don't buy anything from this store, The camera was defected, The ATN electronic store don't return your money, if you open the product,I have to contact Archos website for then replace my camera.....PLEASE DON'T BUY ANYTHING FROM ATN ELECTRONIC STORE.."
4,Good Reading,"If you want to learn more about skijoring, this is a good book to read. I have not moved forward with purchasing the actual equipment, but this book has given me some very good tips to use. I would recommend it to others."
5,Skijor with Your Dog,Love this book! Used it to gain plenty of knowledge as to the fun sport of Skijoring. I was able to confidently start up this sport and referenced the book many many times...we better understood how to set up our dogs for the sport without the trial and error process. I loved being knowledgable about the sport while introducing my dogs to it. Did this for fun..never tried it for the racing aspect but I would have felt very confident moving towards this aspect of this sport.
3,"Not a Whole Lot to Listen to Here, Folks","This compilation of themes from BBC television programs isn't exactly what I'd call a shining light, to mix senses if not metaphors, unless perhaps you occasionally get nostalgic for such shows as Eastenders, Whicker's World, Star Cops and the like. Some themes are rather second rate pop-like works, while others are somewhat experimental and not that successful, in my view. The best is a prolonged rendition of the principal theme from the Miss Marple dramatizations of the 1980s: A sprightly overture with Baroque inclinations that is the delight of the album. Still, if you're looking to have it and the themes to Dallas, Knots Landing, Dr. Who and Fawlty Towers all on one disc, here they are. Otherwise, I'd give this pretty much a pass."
5,Great messenger bag!!!,Bungalow360 makes great stuff! This whale bag was a great gift idea!!! They offer bags with different animals that are cutely designed!
2,Sadly Dissapointed,"I was really looking forward to watching this, but when it arrived I just did not enjoy it. Selecter has some great songs ""Missing Words"", ""3 Minute Hero"", ""Too Much Pressure"", ""On My Radio"", but this concert either captured the sound very badly, or was just not a very good live performance. Either way, I was sadly disapointed and cannot recommend it."
4,93-95 SHO exhaust,"First off, this kit is only for automatic trans. cars. If you have a 92-95 SHO stick-shift, look at part# 17400. This kit replaces everything from the factory flex pipe back. Fit is good, although my left side muffler/tailpipe hangs a little lower than the right. Exhaust note is deep, and a little louder than stock mufflers but at regular cruising speed almost unnoticeable. So if your factory mufflers are completely rotted(like mine were) this is a good system for daily driven cars. Also if you're considering getting just the dynomax mufflers, note that they are the same ones from this kit and may not hook up to the stock pipes without adapters. Factory pipe is 1 3/4 inch, Dynomax is 2 1/4 inch."
4,pleasent and diverse,"In a pleasent & easy read, islam's diverse musical trends are are made apparent by jenkins presentation of a myriad of instruments in various islamic nations.Many of which are still preserved in their original form and served as prototypes for contemporary western instruments.Jenkins does a great service to islamic culture in bringing to the fore an aspect of a musical heritage which spawned and influenced many others, a heritage which because of many muslim stoics and is on its death bed. This is by no means a monumental or philosophical treatise on music but rather an enjoyable museum in print."
5,Great songs with an even better twist!,"All of the songs on here are covers of older song except for the last one ""Brave Reality"", but please do not let that stop you from getting this CD if you are a fan of Evergreen Terrace. They have done an exceptional job at makeing some good classic songs even better. They still manage to keep that sound we all know, love and expect from Evergreen Terrace. This CD gets better and better everytime I listen to it. It has from Tears for Fears ( Mad world) to Smashing pumpkins and offspring. Its a little sort only having 10 songs but what would you prefer, a CD with 10 great songs or a cd where you only listen to one or two songs then switch cds? Ill let you decide but I give this cd my full recomendation."
5,In case of fire - grab this cd first,"I love these guys. They're extremely tallented and they put a spin on songs that are at best mediocre and make them phenominal. I know this wasn't meant to be a huge cd for them, but damn skippy, they did it anyway."
2,et,"this cd's pretty unspectacular, the songs sound exactly like the originals but with screaming.the dying degree cover's no exception but it's heavy and fast enough to be fun."
1,What the crap?,"Sorry, but if all your band can do is take existing music and scream over it....yeah...where's the talent? Zero was absolutly ruined by this band and I, for one, think its a shame that this band was even allowed to remake some of these songs. Just horrible. If I could give it a -1 I would."
1,Awful,"If you really want to hear the exact same songs played note-for-note with screaming vocals and a little more distortion, go ahead and buy it. But in all, this album is terrible. It consists ONLY of poorly rendered covers with no surprises and no artistic changes except for the hardcore screaming.Don't even bother."
1,Ruined songs...,"I already hated all the bands & songs that evergreen t covered and now i have a even more reason to hate them...Why ? evergreen terrence cover those bands, the worse hardcore band ever. sunday bloody sunday by U2 ? Come now, they suck ! The worse cover song tho was zero by the smashing pumpkings...God, i remenber hating that band & song. Well, now i've a reason to hate it even more. Thanks to evergreen terrible! Hardcore music blows! Listing to some gore-grind & deathmetal. Now, thats music !"
3,Kind of a let down,"I love Evergreen Terrace with all of my HXC heart, but this album wasnt as good as i wanted it to be. ET is one of my favorite bands of all time, but i like their originals alot better than their covers. However dont be discouraged from buying it if you are really having an ET craving. A couple of the covers are really good. Maybe im just hating on it because im not a big fan of the originals. Anyway, go pick up 'Burned Alive by Time' if you havent, and if you have, maybe check out these covers on the album:""Zero""""Mad World"" (My Favorite)""Maniac""""Brave Reality""""The Kids arent alright"""
5,excellent,"l love this bracelet, everybody in my office asked me where i bougth it...I recommend it to women that want to look fresh, nice and well dressed..."
3,A good thriller,"i enjoyed it, not as much as follet's the key to rebecca, though, overall, it's a good WWII thriller."
4,Friends or Foes?,I enjoyed this novel thoroughly and think it is the best of Glenn Meade's books. Three old friends amidst the exotic setting of Egypt are plunged into the geopolitical reality of pivotal World War II events (and not necessarily on the same side). The strength of this novel are its characters. The story line does not slow down at all throughout. The exciting audio abridgement of this novel is worth a listen as well.
3,"For Glenn, His New Book Is ""Meade-iocre""","Having read all three of Glenn Meade's books, his latest represents a slump for this talented author. The Sands Of Sakkara is not a bad book; in fact, it is an entertaining read, though fairly predictable. Comparatively, however, an unfortunate trend appears to be emerging with Meade. His latest is not as good as his previous book, Brandenburg, and Brandenburg is not as good as his first,Snow Wolf. To me, Snow Wolf is one of the best historical thrillers I''ve read in many years."
4,Very entertaining and convincing,"The first Glenn Meade book that I read was Brandenburg. It was an unbelievable, fascinating but film-like story. However The Sands of the Sakkara has a more convincing plot, well described settings and powerful surprises that leave you with your mouth open. At some point the reader might think the story is predictable but the desperation and emotions of the characters will amaze you. The sentence ""In a stunning story that reaches from the teeming streets of Berlin to the feet of the great pyramids, three former friends are about to meet again: around a mission to assassinate FDR,"" grabbed my attention and convinced me to read this book. Can you imagine if Germany had won the war? Well, read this book and find out ""how close Germany came to winning the war."""
2,Average historical fiction marred by numerous errors,"The plot and characterization of this WW2 thriller are handled reasonably competently, but it has too many errors to allow the suspension of disbelief necessary to enjoy a book like this. It may sound pedantic but to enjoy these sort of boys books, I at least need to feel confident that the author knows what he is talking about. Two of the more frequent and irrating errors: British (and British derived) air forces do not use army ranks but have their own air force ranks. Thus Mr Meade's air force captain would in fact have been a Flying Officer. And Lieutenant Colonels are addressed as and call themselves ""Colonel""."
1,laughable,"I'm a fan of this genre and was looking forward to my first book by this author. Very disappointed. The idea of a plot against FDR and WC is fine (though we know outcome ahead of time) but the writing sinks the book. The coincidences relied upon to keep the plot moving are rediculous (coincidences usually play a role in spy thrillers but here seem to be used simply out of laziness or lack of imagination). The dialogue is wooden beyond belief as if taken from Hollywood B movies of the 1940s. If the book was ""extensively researched"" (see Amazon review) it doesn't show. The period touches amount to the simple mentioning of makes of old cars, military planes and weapons. For far superior WWII espionage fiction read Alan Furst."
3,Not a Snow Wolf,If this had been the first of his books I probably would have liked it better. It doesn't have the quality of the other two and is too much like Brandenburg Gate (the love triangle).
2,BOOOOOOOOOrrring!!!!!,"The story line is excellent but unfortunately mired in too many depth-less characters and painfully convoluted subplots. It is slow on the uptake tho thankfully does pick up the pace, but only at the last, and after you have waded through so much extraneous babble that you often wondered where you were headed in the first place---which was, incidentally, a plot to assassinate Churchill and Roosevelt.The book flap summary---and even the design of the dust jacket---made it seem like I was in for a treat. Wrong!! I often did not want to pick it back up (it took forever to finish!!!) but I am determined that if I spend money on a book, I'm going to read it.I would recommend this story to only the most patient of readers and certainly will not read again myself."
1,How does stuff like this get published?,"As with the Meade books, someone has to be kidding someone and doing something to someone for something to get this stuff into print. Really, why BS people about stuff that is boring and tiresome. Will St Martin Press give refunds while Mr Meade's connections get him another deal? I am sick of being suckered by your phony reviews."
4,it rules,shark attack files 2 is the greatest shark attack dvd that i have seen to date! I highly recomend it for any DVD shark attack enthusiasts out there. Blood and guts and disembodyment is what its all about. Get it now!
2,Textbook myths,"I found this heavy going, and didn't end up reading it to the end. I guess I was a little disappointed as I was expecting less of a text book approach and more of a story. If you are studying the period, it would make a good point of research."
4,"OK, but its not really what I was looking for","As a huge mythology buff, I thought I would read this account of ""curious myths of the middle ages"". I didn't dislike the book, however, its not at all what I expected or was looking for. Instead of just a simple collection of myths, this is more of an attempt to explain the circumstances that brought about the myths, and give facts pertaining to those myths. In each section, the author tells a myth, then spends countless pages presenting facts, alternative tellings, and general information about the myth. This is all well and good, if you are interested in learning about the origin of myths, however, if you are not (which I was not), then you will probabaly read each myth, then find yourself skimming throught 10-15 pages of non-fiction detail that you really aren't interested in. In fact, I would classify this book as non-fiction, rather than fiction. So, just be aware of what you are getting into when you decide to tackle this book."
2,Kind of tough slogging...,I thought it would be filled with interesting myths and customs of the Middle Ages but really the title is misleading.
1,Seriously Boring,"Very unorganized, I couldn't even find a single myth in here by page 30. This is so not worth it."
4,It helps if you have an imagination.,Enjoyed the book. I always like stories of myths nd especially greek and roman myths. It helps if you have a vivid imagination and are open to possibilities.
3,Interesting Reading - No Table of Contents,"The book is an interesting read and there are an amazing amount of interesting myths that I had no idea existed. It can be tough at times to read but the only negative that I have is that there is no table of contents. That makes it hard to see the delineation in the different myths so if you want to skip to the next myth you have to page through till you find it.You can't be free though and for that the book gets a big thumbs up! If you like history, myth and the middle ages, then this is for you."
3,Sitting on the fence,I like Myths & Myserties & have books on them I've had for years & this was interesting as it showed that our myths aren't only the same in English speaking countries but all over the world but with different languages was hard to track how similar they were. I didn't mind it but couldn't understand some of it
3,Curious myths of the middle ages,"I found this an interesting book, but a dry read, the author also tended to wander about a bit. Thinking about my purchase I possibly needed to read the review more closely. Doubt if I would reread the book"
2,Great book; the worst print quality you'll ever seen,"The book delivered by Amazon.com looks like a photocopied book, not a printed one. Paper quality is the worst. It's totally incompatible with the US$ 140 price.It should be out-of-print or something and then Prentice-Hall found it cheaper to photocopy and bind it, rather then issuing a new edition. Amazon.com should let customers know this in advance.The book content is great as the other reviewers have said, but I'm about to see a book with worse print quality than the one Amazon sent me.I wish I have bought a used book, printed 15 years ago, for US$ 40."
2,Inconsistent,"The company that employees me purchased 5 of these monitors a few years ago. 1 was blurry and we never could get it sharp. 1 was blurry and the guns never wanted to work right (so the color was never very good). They are VERY susceptible to magnetic fields, and will shake severely when near a power conduit. We had to move our desks when we moved into a new office to keep the monitors from driving us crazy.We have had Sony Trinitron monitors before, and in general we have liked them. These, however, do not seem to come up to the standards that one expects from Sony."
1,WASTE OF MONEY,FOLLOWED THE CRAPY INSTRUCTIONS THE BEST WE COULD.WHEN WE PUT IT IN OUR PRINTER THE PAGES CAME OUT A TOTAL MESS. THEY HAD TO BE THROWN AWAY. THEY DONT TELL YOU HOW MUCH OF EACH COLOR TO PUT AND YOU HAVE NO GUIDE LINE. I THREWTHE KIT AWAY IT WAS NOT WORTH THE TIME OR MONEY.
2,Not very likeable or fun,"I felt more sympathetic toward the hookers and sex workers in Km.0 and the porn folks in Fluffer than I did with these sad, scheming, nasty theives.They basically drive their uncapable third partner to suicide by being really hateful to him (even though the father ""loves"" him.)The only decent character is the young man they recruit to replace the ailing man, who, turns out, has a thing both for women and men. In this case, father and daughter. It could be interesting, but it's lost here among the artificial-feeling grittiness and endless series of theft attempts, which pass for story.Bascially, I didn't relate to or care much about the characters, who didn't have much redeeming value, and who didn't learn anything during the movie. And they are all really bad to each other.There are lots better choices than this."
2,RETURN TO SENDER,BORING TALE - EXPECTED SOMETHING BETTER FROM THIS FILM BUT I SHOULD HAVE READ THE REVIEWS MORE DEEPLY AND NOT ORDERED IT
3,A must have for your gay dvd collection!,"If this were remade as an American flick I'm sure it would get wide appeal. The cast is charming and the whole movie is touching and heartwarmning witha feel good ending. It's a nice change to see some older gentleman in love. Fun, clever and charming. A must have for your gay dvd collection!"
2,Smart alec cracks wise,"A writer tells the story of how he and his wife break up. There is very little action here. What there is in every line is glib cracks, lame humor and sarcasm. Ruark even asks one of his characters: ""Why can't people just talk without all the smart remarks and sarcasm?"" Good question."
2,bad video,"James Earl Jones butchers the narration of this 'live' presentation (he was far worse on the actual broadcast: this has been slightly edited!) and the actors portraying Clay Shaw and David Ferrie are horrible. This show was a classic example of the overkill that came after ""JFK"" came out in late 1991---everything good, bad, and ugly came out in book and tv form...this is one of the ugly moments.Vince Palamara"
2,Good packaging - no mushrooms :(,"While this mushroom kit arrived in good packaging and looked ready to go, I was not able to get it to produce mushrooms. I followed the instructions keeping it moist and at the cooler temperatures, but nothing ever happened. I also tried oyster mushrooms a few weeks prior to that, and got huge crops of those, so I was disappointed that these didn't grow at all."
2,Do not attempt if you go on vacation,"Something you won't read on any website selling these mushroom patches is the sensitivity to their exact environment. There are several crucial stages that require you to keep on eye on the mushroom patch which don't mesh well with leaving for vacation. It's a neat product, but don't plan on having mushrooms on your first attempt."
4,VW by Bentley,It has pretty good info. for the do it yourselfer. I saw that everyone suggested this book and so do I.
3,Practical but not entirely Biblical,Great suggestions. Easy to implement directions. Lots of scriptural references. Relevant stories and parables that illustrate the truth he trying to portray. Lacks understanding in the section on the Spirit of God. Does not believe in the power of the baptism in the Holy Ghost and speaking in other tongues. Believes Jesus had to surrender to go to the cross...as if he wasn't anticipating with great joy redeeming fallen mankind.
3,How to Say No to a Stubborn Habiat,"I was satisfied with my order, but did not know that the books would be yellow from age. I was satisfied with the service."
4,Rich in Rhyme,"As in the Ugly Duckling, things do not always turn out as expected. The subtle theme that beauty of character is more important that outside appearance comes across as well in this book. The language in the book and tape is rich in rhyme. The book is useful for individuals as well as small groups."
3,Comfy,I failed to read properly and assumed that for the price there was more than one or two of the items included. I opened the package to find a single panty for the price.... They are fairly comfortable but for that price I can get others equally comfortable and better value for my money.
2,Disappointed,"I got two of these panties after reading other reviews. Yes, they are indeed nice and comfortable. However, the trims on the panties came off in several places after the first wash. It is ridiculous to pay $16 for THIS kind of quality. I am very disappointed!"
3,ok book,"It has a large number of pictures of german vehicles, hence the name. That being said the details and information in here are umm... sparse. Some of the pictures are helpful for building models, but as a book for a military enthusiast save your money."
4,Love this kind of movie,This is a keeper for sure. I will watch it over and over again. I love this era where men were men and women were feminine. The story line is intriguing and I sat riveted from beginning to end.
3,Tide of Life,"I usually love a Catherine Cookson movie, but...this one did not appeal to me. It was acted well and the sets were great. I just found the story line a little too pat for a Cookson story. Others may well like it better than I did."
2,beware,"First of all, this book isn't 344 pages as listed. It is only 156. Secondly, this book only consists of english words and their chinese equivalents in simplified character form. NO pinyin and NO example sentences. This book would only be useful to Chinese people who want to translate english words directly into Chinese. This book is advertised as both english-chinese and chinese-english, however there is no chinese-english. I ordered this book before it was released and just received it. I am extremely disappointed. I repeat: NO Pinyin and NO example sentences."
1,No Pinyin,"I checked Borders and this book doesn't have pinyin, which is a great weakness. I feel it should have pinyin at a minimum."
1,See The Original and then comment!,"The story line is ok but the series sucks!See the Original movie with a fetching young Fairuza Balk as Mildred Hubble.Even my niece who's 7 hated this movie but loved the original. When she saw that there was a series on tape she made me buy the first one then cried when she saw it and wanted to break it.If you can, skip the music video by Curry and concentrate on the movie. You'll love it !!!!!!!!!!"
5,wonderful Idea especially for Hill Side Landscape,As I web searching a lot of Hill side design and idea. Finally got this wonderful / Beautiful design. I can't imagine moving thousand and thousand stone and set up on the Hill side. Made the slope become beautiful just by 2 manpower. I like it !!
4,Good Alternative to Sherlock Holmes,"Lady Molly of Scotland Yard is an enjoyable collection of stories in the Sherlock Holmes manner, although the accounts aren't quite as detailed. Is this where Carole Nelson Douglas got her inspiration for Irene Adler's expanded character, in addition to ""A Scandal in Bohemia""? Both Lady Molly and Irene bear remarkable similarities."
3,early female detective,"Lady Molly seems an interesting prototype for women detectives, and displays some early backbone against gender discrimination. She also seems one step ahead of the crook.This book is actually a collection of short stories with the same title character."
2,Too gruesome to be fun,The 80's remake of The Blob has much wilder special effects but every time The Blob shows up your stomach turns its not as fun as the 5o's version when you couldn't wait to see more Blob. Characters in this movie are the biggest problem THEY ALL DIE. You can't follow anyone cause they die in the next two minutes. And the two chosen characters are less than interesting. Not great. Music by Michael Hoenig. Check out The Stuff its pretty bad too but in a fun funny way.
3,Jelly good fun,"The Blob is a fun movie. It is nothing more. It is nothing less. It won't win any awards for acting or plot, but then it was never really meant to. You see, this '80s remake of the 1950-something [ahem] ""classic"" is really just a ridiculous b-movie with fancy special effects.The plot is almost as absurd as the title, following what appears to be a colossal alien jelly as it rampages through an American town, munching on its inhabitants and generally being a bit of a nuisance. Cue face melting, blood spurting and lots and lots of gore.The acting is as cheesy as everything else in the movie, and the very idea of a psychotic blob murdering people is somewhat laughable, but as i already mentioned, this is an entertaining Saturday night horror film."
4,"Good, Goopy fun","This is a great ""drive-in"" style film, similar to the original except that the special effects are much better. Its well worth a look."
2,The blob,"It is extremely freaky , I still can not get to sleep without the lights on, but it has great special effects and and a extreme gore factor so I give it 2 stars"
3,Gruesome but Witless,"Not a big fan of 50's sci-fi, but the original Blob freaked me out something good. This one just doesn't retain the freakishness or eerie dread of the original. The special effects are definitely better and the gore factor is high, with the requisite shlock-horror bits of T&A thrown in for good measure. Highlights : Blob snaps man in half and pulls him through a small opening, Blob ambushes and explodes woman in phone booth; Dissolving boyfriend scene; Blob ambushes evil men in bio-warfare suits who want to kill blob; and the aforementioned sink scene which could be used as an effective deterrant to young people who want to become plumbers."
4,Classic 80s horror remake,"This movie always scared the crap out of me as a kid and most (but not all) of the FX still hold up pretty well. If you like creepy, slimy alien creatures this is the way to go."
4,Orthodox Church History Interpreted,"This is another important work from the Orthodox scholar Alexander Schmemann worthy of our attention. It was written originally in Russian for the Orthodox people and then translated into English for the sake of the western audience, largely Catholic and Protestant. The difficult and intriguing path of the Orthodox Church through the centuries is the subject matter of the book and it is narrated and interpreted in a scholarly manner here providing a sourcebook for ecumenical dialogue. In commenting on the difficult road of Orthodoxy through the centuries focussed on Byzantium, the author has endeavored to avoid any polemic against Western Christendom in an effort to understand the issues from a neutral standpoint. As a fairly accurate and dependable summary of the history of Eastern Orthodoxy, it is valuable to anyone intending to learn more about the Christian Church from the historical perspective."
1,And Ms. Hegi's point is?,"Early on, I found the author's descriptions of the characters and their Bronx neighborhood both charming and (as a displaced Bronxite of the generation represented by the book's central figure) right-on. Unfortunately, the personal journey each of her characters pursues over some forty-plus years was hopelessly flat and failed to sustain my interest as I labored through to the last, unrevealing chapter. I found myself wondering what point Ms. Hegi was trying to make. Whatever she was aiming at, it never came to fruition."
1,A family saga that disappoints,"I got this book because Ursula Hegi wrote an Oprah Winfrey pick ""Stone From the River"" some years ago and I remember enjoying that book.. While I love a good family saga, I cared nothing about any of the characters in this book. It was tedious, boring and repetitive. The premise of how an act in childhood affects members of several families for years to come seemed intriguing, but it was the only reason that held me to the end and then I realized that the book was actually a waste of time."
2,Disappointing,"I found this book on an awards list and listened to it on CD. It was difficult to finish because I just didn't care about any of the characters. The only redeeming part of the book is the charming narrative with which it opens, told from the viewpoint of a little boy growing up in a close-knit Italian-American family. But the narratives of the adults, which follow, are predictable and fall hopelessly flat. There are the obligatory infidelities and a lesbian dalliance, and there is even some completely gratuitous George Bush bashing! There is much better contemporary fiction out there."
5,sacred tune,i just started it but already enjoying it - i really enjoy all of her books and the book came in very good condition
3,"Lots here, but hard to use","This a very complete book, which is its strength, and the reason I bought it. The whole of Carcassi's method is here, and then some! But, the pages feel crowded and busy, making things difficult for a marginal music reader like me. I get lost. Also, I much prefer a spiral binding like the Mel Bay series. This one is not happy when open on the music stand! Still, it may be the best and most complete reference for Carcassi's method that is readily available."
4,Great Mix,"This book is not for the beginner, but for one who is eager to move beyond an intermediate or beginner stage in classical music. One of my first guitar teachers used this method. Twenty years later, I can still pick my recital tunes like it was yesterday. Well worth the money if you're willing and able to dedicate the time."
1,Lost Its Touch!!!!!,"this season really changed direction,its not even the same show anymore,hey and whats with Nancie and her change of personality(Her Character)its not her anymore,Conrad is gone the best person in the show,They Shoud just call the Show ""Drug War"" Now, not Weeds,this use to be my number 1 show,now its last,and Nancie has to be the biggest most Stupid Drug Dealer/Pusher,she would have been locked up in season 2 in real life, Another Un THought Out Drama Story"
2,Problem with digital snow and freeze up. Pirated?,Long freeze ups and digital snow on last 2 dvd's of season 4. As I bought 3 seasons I did not find out in time to return or replace. I love the show but this set was a pain to watch.
1,Poor DVD Quality - Not Able to Watch,"We bought several seasons of Weeds during after Christmas sales last year. It took as a while to get around to watching them. However, on at least THREE seasons, the DVDs were damaged beyond being able to watch. Buying the seasons was such a WASTE since the DVDs are worthless. I do not recommend buying these DVDs. I have never had trouble with other DVDs purchased from Amazon."
3,I wish they hadn't left Agrestic,"To me, the best part of this show was the contrast in the upper middle class Nancy and her decidedly lower class way of making money. A mom with two kids in a beautiful neighborhood dealing to make a living was interesting. It was fun to see her trying to adjust to this different way of life. Now that she, her family and friends have left Agrestic, it's just another show about another drug dealer as far as I'm concerned."
2,Boo on exchange policy!!!,"Hey, great series... However this is the second time that Amazon has delivered a set of dvds where one is severely damaged. No noticable marks/scratches but disc will not play and freezes up system. Returns for full refund are only if item has not been opened... the exchange policy requires return for half refund and then you have to buy it again at full price. Very dissatisfied customer."
1,Beware: region coded,"Unlike seasons 1 - 3 of Weeds, this blu-ray is region coded and will noy work on European players. I've bought a useless disc.Since Weeds is unavailable on blu-ray in my country (Holland), to me this means it's another example on how the industry discourages customers that like to buy their media legally. I guess I'll have to resort to downloading the rest of the series.At least we are able to buy real weed here legally."
2,Weeds and other trash,"This series, like its predecessors is nothing but trash. It is soft porn (and not so soft), derides all morals and sensibilities, and is an insult to one's intelligence. Steer well clear."
3,Not the best season,"Season's 1, 2, and definitely 3 were quite a bit better than the season 4 of Weeds. It moves away from the suburban life that we've grown to love and into a darker more drug realistic lifestyle. This show isn't trying to glamorize the drug industry anymore... at least not in this season."
3,"AMAZING series, but problem with one disc.",LOVE the season!!! This show is incredible!!! But the 3rd disc will not play. The inside of the disc is horribly cracked. I am very saddened by this. But I am going to send it back and order it again!!! I'm addicted!
5,Weeds Season Four,"This wacky series of soccer mom, Nancy Botwin never seems to disappoint. Wildly entertaining."
5,Simplemente maravillosa,"Esta serie ha sido desde la primer temporada simplemente adictiva para mi, se las recomiendo a todos..."
1,This series went downhill after Season 2,"I enjoyed the first 2 seasons of Weeds, and I tolerated the 3rd season, but I just couldn't find anything at all to like about season 4. If you can get it free somewhere, I would say go ahead and watch it, but don't pay money for it..it's not worth it. I was given seasons 5 and 6 and I watched all of 5 but only got halfway through 6..by that point the lead character is so horrible and the whole plot so tired I couldn't keep watching even for free lol."
2,"As go all good things eventually, Weeds has jumped the bong.","Very disappointing fourth season of one of my favorite all time television shows. Pretty obvious that they lost a key writer or writers, and having MLP always in skimpy outfits is nice, but doesn't save the season by a long stretch.The outrageous, hilarious gag ratio in this season has dropped precipitously. Lots of trite, shopworn humor has taken the edge and originality off. Only a couple of laugh out loud moments. Won't be buying or watching further. Thanks for three great seasons of incredible television."
5,Great show! Great cast! Cant wait for season 5!,"The first time I watched weeds I didnt like it. For some reason I watched another episode and absolutely fell in love with it. I now own seasons 1-3 and have just preordered season 4 (which I have already seen on showtime). The cast is great. I really like Kevin Nealon's character, absolutely hilarious!If for some reason you are having doubts as to buying this season, believe me, it is as good if not better than the other 3. I would encourage you to start from season 1 (which is also cheap on amazon.com) so you can see all the character development. Season 4 is great on it's own(it was the first season I watched prior to buying 1-3) but watching the other 3 first would make it even better!"
3,No longer a need for me to watch,"Everything that was enjoyable about the first season is pretty much changed and gone with this season. Her interaction with Helia and family - Gone. The soccer mom turned drug dealer - gone. The chicanery of the neighbors in the burbs is gone as well. Andy is no longer funny, as he used to be. Shane is no longer cute. Doug used to be hilarious. No more.Had this been season 1, I wouldn't have watched Season 2. However, I'm still hooked and have to continue to see how things play out, so I'll be watching more. But by this season, the only characters I don't dislike are Conrad and Celia.Albert Brooks? Not funny at all. Not even a little.I miss the gut busting laughs and I keep watching in hopes that they get that back."
3,The slide begins...,"Nancy Botwin and clan are now on the run from their suburbian paradise/hellhole of Agrestic. While the show was never truly believable, it was witty and clever. This season is where the comedy starts to disappear as the Botwins are fugitives hiding out near the Mexican border. The drama is turned up a notch but the switch in supporting characters makes the show rather worse for wear. As Celia Hoades exits we no longer have a villain/nemesis that we can have a hearty laugh at. Instead there's an attempt at creating a sense of danger in breezy 24-minute chunks. It doesn't really work, and this is where Weeds starts to slide into the pits. Ratings continued to increase as word-of-mouth about the show spread, but the charm of the early seasons is well and truly lost."
5,Great series,A must have series. On the lines of Sherman Oaks if anyone actually saw it). Hats off too showtime. I only wish i could find the Sherman Oaks series on Amazon.
5,Great series.....,"The video is in good quality and DVD was shipped in 3 days without having to pay for extra costs. It was hard finding Season 4 at any department store, book store or electonic store. You'll definately enjoy season 4 it flys by and you'll be tired the next day cuz you stayed up all night watching ENJOY"
3,When good writing goes bad,"Season 4 is when Weeds jumped the shark. I'd say beware of spoilers but it seems that nobody warns about spoilers anymore so here goes. Nancy starts dating a mayor/drug czar from Tijuana??? Doug and Andy become immigrant coyotes??? Really? It's still relatively entertaining because I've had so much enjoyment watching the lives of the characters for the first 3 seasons. I want to see what happens, I'm invested in the story, but good lord, the writers screwed this season from the get go. Disappointing."
2,Cover is kinda cute but..................,"Aside from the hot cougar in this show, and yes I think she's a decent actress the show just isn't funny or really intriguing. Also I always thought the plot was kinda bad. Whaaaaa! I can't live in the wealthy suburbs I gotta turn to illegal drug trafficking. It would be one thing if if was to survive and barely cling to life. But this show is just about money loving people who wanna live the fine life at the expense of others!Its not the worse show on TV (DEXTER owns that) but there are much better programs out there."
4,DVD-series,"Came within a couple of days of ordering, was in great condition, couldn't expect better."
5,realy great show,"realy liked the show, was nice to watch when the boys where at school or sleeping, always kept me wondering what was next.!"
1,bummed out in north idaho,"Awesome show! However dvd's were poor quality, they skipped around a bunch on several different players. Didn't pay a lot for them, but a dissappointment."
4,good,"great season, however i have my suspicions from the buyer. opened it and the disc holders were falling apart. i think it was open already and i bought it ""new"""
3,Disappointing considering how much space the DVD gave them.,"My review in on par with most of the ones written below. If you're an avid NFL fan like me, DVDs like this will attract your eye, but wait for the documentary on HBO or another channel.The documentary has a few extras included such as extended interviews, different audio segments of the same play, etc.. but there was so MUCH MORE that NFL Films could have included on a DVD capable of holding this much memory. I viewed the extras that are watchable with a computer DVD player... Nothing impressive, a collection of stats that you could get on any internet site...Not worth it until the price drops... If you're an NFL fan, you'll enjoy what you watch, but it's over quick!"
3,"Jam packed with exciting DVD features, but short","This DVD is a great one if you are hoping to see what differences there are between DVDs and VHS tapes. It has several cool features, including listening to commentary on certain plays by broadcasters for both teams. The DVD highlights one scene from each Super Bpwl up to and including Super Bowl No. 34, so it does fall short of packing in more of the truly ""greatest"" moments of the game. It is a fun DVD for features and the interviews & trivia are great, but don't expect too much in terms of length and materials."
2,Football...,"The dvd does not live up to expectations, the details were sketchy at best... I would not buy another..."
2,Disappointing,"I am quite possibly the biggest football fan on Earth (though I'm sure most of you will argue that point). My library of NFL films spans darn near all of them. I received this DVD as a present, watched it once and have never even had the urge to pick it up again. It's not very exciting, it's not compelling and it's basically little more than a droning documentary. It gets two stars just because it's football."
1,Not For Sale!!,"Mr. Cayse never charged for his work, because he thought that it was to help others and, that it was a gift. I have seen many of the things he had seen. I know that there is no way I could ever sell that kind of information, nor would my childern for that matter. I feel that Mr. Cayse would still feel the same about his gift if he were a live today. Thank You, Randi"
3,Kate zuliebe,"Die ganze Geschichte hat mich gelangweilt. Ich fand keinen Draht zu ihr, wie man so schön sagt. Wäre Kate Mulgrew nicht mit von der Partie, ich hätte den Streifen nicht bis zum Ende durchgehalten.Filmisch ist nicht viel daran auszusetzen. Die Kostüme sind gut und die Darsteller passabel."
1,Kate Mulgrew before Voyager,"""A Time for Miracles"" is an underrated gem. Showing a bit of American history that is often neglected, and showing Kate Mulgrew as a determined woman who was strong willed, clever, not afraid of anyone, and was fond of coffee. No wonder she was cast as Katherine Janeway."
1,It really could have been more realistic.,"This is sweet family fare, but that is what it is -- sweet. Where is the dirt of the 18th century? Where are the stinks and the vile smell -- even from the Roman curia?Unfortunately this all reeks of one of Kate Mulgrew's ""Irish Spring"" commercials.Saints aren't usually this nice. They are rebels who seek not only to serve God, but to upturn the status-quo. Mother Seton seems to work with the status-quo quite well. Where is the persecution? Where is the burning anger a saint often feels?Isn't there more?Just too sweet for my taste."
1,"Read ""Butler's Lives of the Saints"" Instead","This is a remarkably uncatholic movie that is supposedly about a famous Catholic. St. Bonaventure said that those who do not have a devotion to Our Lady will die in their sins and be damned for all of eternity. Nevertheless, Elizabeth Seton is never portrayed as having a devotion to Our Lady and indeed, never even says one hail mary that I could see. Other Catholic teachings are notably absent. The acting and production values are lamentably poor. Read ""Butler's Lives of the Saints"" or ""The Baltimore Catechism"" instead."
4,Fun read,"Determined to win his rightful fortune and comply with his grandfather's will, Alec MacLean must marry before his next birthday. In just two hours. When his plans to marry the woman mentioned in the will backfires, he marries the woman he accidentally abducted instead, her cousin Julia.Julia Frant has secretly loved Alec for four years so when the opportunity to marry him arises she jumps at the chance, and at the chance for money to go toward her worth causes. But the will has one stipulation. They must live scandal free for one full year. Can a do-good reformer like Julia live a year without a scandal?The marriage starts off rocky with plans for an annulment after one year, but love gets in the way and the two find themselves drawn to eachother. Is it possible to fall in love with your own spouse?This was the first book I've read by Karen Hawkins and was completly impressed. I highly recommend this book and hope to read more of her in the future."
3,enjoyable read,"The Abduction of Julia is light and humorous, with likeable characters. Julia's been in love with Alec for as long as she can remember so when he kidnaps her by mistake, meaning to elope with her cousin, she's not too unhappy! Alec isn't too unhappy, either, because he's marrying to gain an inheritance. A familiar plot, but it's entertainingly handled. I usually like a bit more adventure mixed in with my romances, but I'll be looking out for more books by the same author."
4,A very pleasant read,This is the perfect book for a quiet interlude on the couch. You will enjoy it from beginning to end
5,Grinning ear to ear,"If you liked ONE LUCKY LORD, you'll love THE ABDUCTION OF JULIA. I found myself laughing out loud in some spots, and falling in love with the hero, Alec.The only bad part was that it ended too soon. This is one reader who is eagerly anticipating Ms. Hawkins next release."
1,This is Love?,"Julia, kidnapped by Alec to keep his inheritance, is a reformer who demands half of Alec's inheritance to help her in her Women's Society efforts. Alec should have sent Julia packing. She supposedly loved him for years but instead of behaving in a friendly manner, loving I guess was too much to ask for, is always a shrew to Alec. Why? It is logical to assume that the more shrewish and unreasonable, yes very unreasonable, she became, the more problems they would have. This is not a good love story in that I wish Alec would have found someone else. Lucien's story, which comes out in 2001, I look forward to and I hope he choses more wisely."
1,Interesting Start.. Then really boring!,"This book had an excellent theme: ugly duckling intrigues handsome hero with her wit and unique character, and then she becomes a swan and steals the hero's heart. The book had a promising start with interesting dialogue and the instant attraction of the h/h. However.... the book quickly bogged down. Despite their mutual attraction, and the fact that Julia has loved the hero for four years, and the fact that they are MARRIED - the couple have hardly any physical interaction in the book. The smolder that started in the first dozen pages was all smoke and no fire for this reader. When the couple finally consummate the marriage, it is a disappointment and I almost didn't care! I skipped through pages and pages of this book - which is something I have NEVER done before. Since this was the author's first book, perhaps I will give her one more chance in a more recent work. However, I will certainly check it out at the library before I buy any of her other books."
3,Very middle of the road...,"Maybe I'm just feeling impatient today. I tossed aside several books before I settled on this one and I really can't focus on it so I keep putting it down to do something else. I've read about a third of it and I reckon that's enough. I just feel like I've read it before. Not literally, but more figuratively. There's nothing special about the story. The characters are all suitably likeable, although the heroine is of the sickly sweet do-gooder variety that makes you want to throw up with her overwhelming concern for others. The villians are also suitablly villanous with their evil machinations. It seems an okay story, but there are so much better ones out there."
5,A KEEPER!,I enjoyed this book immensely. The characters were very fun to read. The heroine was very spunky and hero was wonderful. She is a dedicated reform worker from America and he is a rake from England. She marries him so he could take possession of his fortune. She wants a portion of the fortune so she can continue her charity work. She has loved him for many years and he falls in love with her after he marries her. Her cousin and his cousin are trying to foil his attempts at getting the fortune. This was a great book. I cannot wait for her next one.
1,Forgettable,"I didn't like this book. I found it really boring. I had to force myself to finish it. The heroine was too perfect, and I didn't feel that she and the hero had a lot of chemistry. I prefer passionate love stories. They were so dull together. I don't think I'll be buying another book by this author."
3,Too much good,"Having previously enjoyed Karen Hawkins' MacLean family books which were well written with rounded characters and good plots I thought this would be more of the same. It wasn't. In fairness the plot was standard and could have been much more enjoyable except it was difficult to stomach the heroine. She was too good to be true, in fact, she is so good and so selfless that she comes over as being sanctimonious and it is difficult to sympathise with her. Yes we all understand about the redemptive power of the good woman over the rake but come on! I wish I had bought a different Hawkins."
3,"BEEN THERE, DONE THAT","Fairly good writing and characterizations, but not an original plot. For the perfect book using this plot, read Georgette Heyer's ""Devil's Cub"". I guess it is unfair to compare the two since Ms. Heyer is the queen of this genre. Abduction is an amusing story but maybe a little too much angst."
5,Wonderful read!,I thought this book was wonderful. It captured my interest right from the beginning and held it to the end. I was able to connect with the characters right away so I felt like I had a vested interest in the outcome. Karen Hawkins is a very talented writer. When I got to the end of the book I found myself wishing she would do a book on Alec's friend Lucien. I picked up the second book of hers I had ordered that day and it was about Lucien! I am reading that now and am just as enthralled with it.
4,LOVELY,"This book is how romance novels should be. Though it didn't become one of my favorites, I could not put it down. Julia was a steady woman(just the way women should be in and out of love)and Alec couldn't help but fall in love with is unorthodox wife. It is a book with developed characters that makes for a good read."
1,"""Very Boring""",I lot of unnecessary writing. Too boring. I will not be picking up anything else by this author. For all the readers that rated this book a 4 or 5....they must have mistaken this book for another.
3,Washable blue ink,"This ink is the same as Pelikan 4001 Blue or Royal Blue. It is washable, so parents can give it to children without worrying. It can also be chemically erased/eradicated by eradicators like the Pelikan Super Pirat, which is convenient for students. Like most blue inks for fountain pens, this one dries to a lighter hue than most ballpoint and rollerball/gel blue inks. This ink is not safe for writing checks. Many fountain pen enthusiasts love this ink. I think it's OK; it's OK on bad paper, but not good enough for two-sided writing on bad paper. There are better blue inks for fountain pens."
5,love it,"This ink is so durable and the color is great. Just what I want. Oh, I bought several bottles in 2006. It is still good."
1,visual irritation,"I bought this video grouped with ""The Call"" (another awful video). I am not impressed. These are the worst animation videos I have ever seen and am baffled as to how they made it on dvd.This one is better than ""The Call"" but I still wish I had not bought it. I feel fooled by the cover art and the other customer reviews."
4,Old Skool Southern Drop,"If you enjoy DJ Magic Mike this CD is in the same caliber. I was surprised It had all low end bass with scratchin what I am into. Many of some of the same beats Magic uses but with there own style. This is Strip club, booty dropin' , bass CD I enjoyed it. Favorite Tracks 2. A-Town players in the house 7. A-Town Drop Re-mix 8. Kizzy Hurt 'Em and more. Cop it."
2,Not the greatest.........,"This disc is OK if you really don't care about quality. The prints they used show alot of wear. For ""HE WALKED BY NIGHT"", i would suggest you buy the disc put out by MGM. The print they used here for ""TOO LATE FOR TEARS"" looks like the same one that Image Entertainment used. It has several splices and scratches. TOO LATE FOR TEARS was also released under the title ""KILLER BAIT"" which is available in a better quality print in a 6 disc set called ""5 Killer Film Noir Classics"". As for ""KANSAS CITY CONFIDENTIAL"", if i remember right the disc put out by Image is of better quality. (This review is for the ""Film Noir Triple Feature Vol. 1"" disc put out by Goodtimes Video"")"
2,I can think of more interesting people to hang out with...,"Dominik is a mediterranean guy who loves sex. This video treats us to an interview with him, scenes of him trying on various ""sexy"" clothing (jockstrap, wrestler unitard, et al), working out on a treadmill, getting a (rather uneventful) massage, and (finally!) taking a shower. And while Dominik is a decent-looking guy with a nice body, he's hardly captivating enough for an hour-long feature. He has little of interest to discuss during the interview. And while he continues to ramble on while being massaged, the producers apparently decided whatever was coming out of his mouth was so uninteresting that they covered it up with some mellow music.In short, if you're willing to spend the day (or even an hour) with Dominik, you really need to get a life."
2,Don't read the beginning or the end.,"This author actually believes that she can tell you all about your life just by what age you are and she can predict what kind of story you will write, just by knowing your age. Wrong! There is also an entire section telling to basically quit your job, ignore your loved ones and devote yourself fully to becoming a millionare writing in Hollywood (which in reality, most of you will never make a penny doing). This book is entirely unrealistic, but not because of the premise of the title.What I do like about this book is she pushes you to quit procrastinating, gives good writing exercises, and gives you your basic outline without being too specific. Not really the book I was looking for."
2,Outdated but still sort of useful,"This book is okay. I've actually written 2 screenplays in less than 21 days, but I ended up revising them over and over again until I felt confident enough to even register both with the WGA. I'm glad I didn't buy this book new - got it for just a few dollars at a used bookstore. I find How Not To Write A Screenplay more worthwhile."
2,Disappointed,"When ordering this book I thought I was going to get instruction on how to write a screenplay with format, what I did recieve is how to put an idea on paper of which I already have done. Disappointed in Scottsdale!"
1,Haste makes waste,"This was the first book I bought when I was learning how to write screenplays. I have a finished screenplay now, but this book was not at all helpful. In my opinion this book adds to the difficulty of writing a screenplay when there is a time factor. I would suggest a period of at least 2 months, most of the time going into planning. Who really cares about how quick you can write a screenplay, isn't the real goal to see how good you can write one? By the way of all the seminars by professional screenwriters that I've been to, I've brought this book up. None of them cared for it. Suggested instead was WRITING SCREENPLAYS THAT SELL by Michael Hauge, and after that Syd Field's books which go more into detail."
2,How To Write a Movie in 21 Days,"I purchased and read this book because it was recommended by an author that has helped me develop in the screenwriting craft. But I didn't find it particularly helpful or practical. However, you might draw some inspiration from it."
4,Inspiring,"Unlike most sreenwriting books, this one seems to speak directly to the reader and keep their interst by influencing the writer to keep on writing instead of discouraging them with reality checks like most writers tend to do. Viki King has the abiltiy to inspire the writer in all of us helping them to work through the road blocks."
4,Just started but so far so good,"It has really given me alot of good tips so far but unfortunately I have just started the book, I still have lots more to go but so far it has helped me alot in my imagination and writing and helped me see things differently than the dirrection I was going, I recomend this book, it is good."
3,NOT for Beginners,"This book is a quick and entertaining read and if you follow it, you will be able to write a movie in 21 days -- but not a GOOD movie. The book provides a method for producing pages, but gives you nothing about creating a good story, characters, dialogue, or the so very important HOOK. I suggest you read other books, read articles on screenwriting, take a screenwriting class, read good produced screenplays. Go through the process of writing a screenplay with the needed elements -- a screenwriting class can help you do this. Then, after you understand what writing a script is about, then you might be able to use Viki King's book as a discipline guide to help you put out some pages. Fact is, writing a screenplay is NOT easy, NOT quick, and once you've done one and gotten legitimate critique on it, then you will learn what all of the produced screenwriters preach -- writing is re-writing."
5,Wonderful book!,"This book arrived really fast. I already had a copy of this book; I purchased a copy for a friend because I think it's great. It's great for beginners, or writers who feel blocked."
3,How to write a movie even if you have no ideas,"The author don't offer more than it promises: if you follow the advices, you will write a movie. Not a good one, but you will write.In fact, it may be a good book for those who need rules to keep writing day after day.But unless you are very gifted, don't expect to write a selleable script with only this book. According to the author you can write a movie even if you have any idea of plot or anything (just write about your personal experience)."
1,REALLY WIERD!,"I thought this book was the strangest I've ever read regarding screenwriting. Screenwriting and spirituality may or may not mix, but spirituality really has nothing to do with writing a good screenplay! I have to agree with the previous reviewer who gave the book one star and say that I, too, found little practical advice in this book and the premise is even stranger. Why 21 days? Why does the author suggest that we whip out a screenplay in only 21 days? Isn't quality better than speed. I recommend Syd Field and Lajos Egri instead. Both are real pros and their books offer much detail and useful advice."
5,Wanna see it in use?,"I really didn't plan on writin a *movie*, but I was looking for something that would serve as a cheerleader and coach, a mentor with a deadline, to get me to write and finish SOMETHING, hopefully in a relatively short about of time."
4,Worked for Me!,"This is a gimmick book with substance, if such a thing is possible.At the risk of sounding like a cheesey testimonial, I want to say that I bought the book, read it, followed the simple advice she offered and the result was a finished screenplay.Viki King understands all the things that prevent people who want to write from doing so. She can chase away all the negative thoughts that cloud a writer's mind. I also appreciated the way she assures you that quitting your job and selling all you own will not make it any easier to finish something if you are not in the right frame of mind.Have I sold my screenplay? No. But the satisfaction I got in finally finishing one was worth the price of the book and then some."
5,If you can't get past page 60...,"I am a working screenwriter, and this is the only screenwriting book I recommend. Why? Most of the screenwriting books out there are very useful - for rewriting. This book actually gets you to complete the first draft - a huge hurdle for beginning writers. You probably won't finish in 21 days, and the draft you write probably won't be very good. But that doesn't matter, because you will finish a draft, and then you can rewrite it and make it good.I still use this book to clarify my thinking, or if I'm on a tight deadline."
4,Wonderfully helpful!,"This book is only one of seven that I read to get me started in screenwriting. Her techniques really work. She gets you to write. No more endlessly pondering everything and being fearful. After 21 days, you will have a first draft (not a finished script), but it is a lot closer than having nothing at all on paper. I now have an L.A. agent who is working to sell my first screenplay. Viki King is, in part, to be thanked!"
3,Large and thin!,"The clothing from this catalog is a bit overpriced, and it is very thin. You need to wear at least 2 shirts so it wont be see-thru. This shirt was too large for my daughter as the brand runs large."
5,"Awesome, ignore reviewers that DO NOT read the manual","I personally have been using this fountain for three years now and PLEASE read the instruction manual PEOPLE! ( im only saying this because I know for a fact ppl did not do it correctly and made a bad review for their ignorance)You have to put the pump in the water for it to cycle the water back into the machine, once the pump is placed CORRECTLY you will hear no sounds of the pump. You also can control how fast you want the water to flow , which is wonderful. You may have slow flow which sounds like a slow moving creek or turn the water up and you can enjoy sounds of rain, from sprinkles to raining hard! Hope this helps, and everyone please read manuals when you buy something, haha :)"
1,Did not like it.,I am unsure what I was expecting but this was not a good story. I did not care for the authors viewpoint. She was hard to relate too and not easily liked.
5,Not just for women,"This book has turned my head around concerning marriage, love and sex. Even at 58 years old, she taught me about things that I always had questions about but was unable to even formulate the REAL question so I could deal with a long term marraige that has become boring. I now have direction and purpose. This is a must read for all genders and ages if you want to, really live life."
2,"ADULTRY, LIES, PROFANITY and THEFT","This movie is shameful to say the lest! If you like Pride & Prejudice, Sense & Sensiblity, Mansfield Park, The Girl is not a romantic story at all. Movie will be a waste of time and money.Hannah is a thief from the very beginning as a child, she commits adultry, profanity is used throughout the movie every now and then. Not worth seeing, but you judge for yourselfBe warned!"
2,very dark period piece........,"The Girl, based on a Catherine Cookson novel, is a period drama set in Victorian times. While the sets, costumes are actors are all exceptional, the story itself is one of the darkest and disturbing ones I've seen.While in all probability more realistic to the times, Cooksons portrayal of a young girl, born on the ""wrong"" side of the bed, and her eventual life with her illegitimate father, and terribly sadistic stepmother is very hard to watch. Be forewarned-this is not a ""family"" film, as brutal beatings of children, forced sex, adultery, attempted murder, someones hand almost cut off in a ""man trap"", and many more throughly unpleasant scenes make up this mini series.In the end, I found no characters worth any empathy, in fact the ""heroine"" herself becomes so sneaky and underhanded that I for one wished she would NOT end up with the hero at the end.A depressing way to kill several hours and one I would not recommend.1.5 stars for the sets and costuming."
5,Love these!,"I love these, they making shipping items so much easier and are a lot cheaper than bubble envelopes. I don't have to worry about them getting torn and products being lost or stolen."
5,Great buy,These mailers are a great value. They are thick enough to hold items securely and seal well. I would reccomend them.
4,"Yes, Bluegills are easy to catch...","The focus of the book is also where the large bluegills live. Weather and season wise is also taken into account. I have caught nice fish on flys and on string and safety pins as a kid. I want a trophy and dinner. Yes, I will let the trophy go after the photos. Buy it..."
1,I hate it,"After reading the book and having the pleasure of meeting the authors in Missouri, all I can say...nothing new here. If you consider ripping off existing fly patterns revolutionary...go ahead, buy the book. Buy some Tony Accardo flies and poppers and take your hat off to a true master."
1,ONE OF THE WORST VIDEOS EVER!,"DO NOT -- I repeat -- do NOT say you were not forewarned if you buy this video!! It is HORRIBLE!! I bought this video in anticipation of visiting Santiago, expecting film footage and information on the shrine. Instead, it contains about 27 minutes of two old men's comments on their journey through Spain and the surrounding countryside, and only about 3 minutes worth of film or information on the shrine or city itself!! VERY DISAPPOINTING if you are looking for real information, as I was. What a ripoff!! YOU HAVE BEEN WARNED!!!!!!"
5,Favorite Christmas Album!,You'll love this album! I have lots of Christmas music but 'Christmas Under the Western Sky' is without a doubt my favorite! It's a collection of Christmas classics performed in an easy listening but upbeat country instrumental sound that is never tiring.
4,"Nice heater, puts out a surprising amount of heat.","Much more heat than a conventional, wire-element heater. I don't know why that is, but it's true.Controls are a little confusing (actually need to read the manual), which is the only reason the item didn't get 5 stars. Performance is worth 5 stars."
3,A commentary on bipolar disorder set in a fantasy,"This is a retelling of the 12 dancing princesses. In short - the princesses of the land dance their shoes to smithereens every night, and solving the mystery behind these strange events is usually the sum of the tale.In this case, there are other things added in.There is the lesson of true friendship and true loyalty.There is the commentary on representative government versus monarchyThis is the story of dealing with illness in your life - dealing with ""handicaps"" and overcoming them.I found the story to be good, but a little preachy. I think it would be a good story to read if one were trying to expose children to the lesson of tolerance and acceptance. It is not a simple retold fairy tale.(*)>"
3,"Bipolar disease brochure, not a fairy tale","Phoenix Dance is an unusual story for a teen read. As an adult, I was surprised at the entry into the world of bipolar disease. It made a good springboard into the topic, as discussed with my teenage daughter. The abject misery of Phoenix during her onsets, and her dissatisfaction with life while taking the medicines are all common complaints among the mentally ill.The idea of this being a fairy tale retelling is laughable. We have so little in common with the princesses - why do we care about their problems? And the idea of each one picking their own color for the day is just ridiculous. Puh-leese comes to mind.From a teen reading aspect, I like the way Phoenix has to work out her relationship with Rora. And her tough mindedness when it comes to working for what she wants. And her appreciation of beauty. And her creativity.But overall, this tale is hardly entertainment."
1,Faceless by David Douglas Duncan,"Only on very rare occasions has Henri Cartier-Bresson who has spent his adult life capturing the images of others allowed himself to be photographed. Mr. Duncan's decisive five minutes with his former associate now provide a unique opportunity to see HCB in action, but I suspect that ""Faceless"" would not have sat still for the candids if he realized that his old friend DDD was going to blow his cover and publish the off-guard moments. One reviewer of this book notes that Mr. Duncan lost his friendship with HCB because he published these photos. Even though the proceeds from the book will go to the University of Texas, losing a friendship would not be worth this book of snapshots."
5,Replacement Cord,This cord has a straight plug into the back of the receiver. Much better design than original cord with 90 degree bend.
2,Connection wire is broken,"Poor design. Speaker works ok, but the wire is dangling just waiting to completly break. I have tried tie wraps, electical tape and nothing really can hold. Just a bad design."
2,Like the other one. poor cable,"Ese angulo de 90 grados del chupon es malisimo, aparte me costo un mundo poder enchufarlo, no queria entrar y tuve que forzarlo..."
2,Fuse assemply poorly designed,"Unless you catch it, I've unplugged the until from a rental car and not noticed the end screw holding the fuse has come off and I'm left with a worthless cable after I discover the situation when I get home. Yeah it's my fault but it's still poorly designed -- I've had two other units just stop working (after the warranty of course)."
1,bad plug,"eventhough the add for this charger speaker said it would fit several garmin models including the 478 which is what I have, it does not work with my unit. It will plug in and if I want to hold the plug in place, will work.However if you are not able to hold the cable and the unit together, it will fall out. comparing it to my existing charger cord, it is missing a flared out area close to the end of the cord which would allow friction to hold the cord in place. This cord does not have this, it is not the same as the cords that I have purchased in the past and therefore it is useless to me.It was a good price and I liked the fact that the cord did not have a 90 degree turn at the plug but it still does not stay in place and cannot be used."
3,different from textbooks,"This is not extremely helpful. It is explained well, but it does not follow the textbook or use many of the same cases. I really didnt use it much."
2,Dressed to Kill/Woman in Green/Terror by Night-set,"I think some of the postings here have been less than truthful. This particular DVD is very grainy, the sound is often muddy and there are occasional jumps in scenes. I do not recommend this to a buyer wanting to add some Holmes films to his library. Surely there's a better offering out there...and if not, I would suggest waiting till someone offers a digitally remastered version of these very fine old films."
1,Dreadful quality DVD!,The quality of the reproduction on this DVD is appalling and I've had to return this disc as it is unwatchable! Your other reviewers seem to think that the low price more than compensates for the lack of quality!? This disc is an insult to three 'classic' films!This disc is really very poor and it's cost me a lot of good money in returning it!
3,Vintage Holmes Portrayals,"Basil Rathbone's portrayal of Holmes, while less mercurial and intense than Jeremy Brett's, has stood up well over the years. Unfortunately, Nigel Bruce's characterization of Watson as a lovable dolt has not. Also, the production values are far below the earlier ""Hound of the Baskervilles"" and ""The Adventures of Sherlock Holmes"" not to mention those of the modern BBC productions. Nevertheless, I found these fun to watch.My favorites in this set are ""Dressed to Kill"" and ""The Woman in Green"". Both are original stories that transpose the Holmes and Watson characters to the 20th century. In each, Holmes matches wits with a wily femme fatale, as in ""A Scandal in Bohemia"".The DVD transfer is acceptable, but well below the quality one might hope for."
3,not what I expected,I own and have carried several of the Buck 110's over the years. The advertising for this knife led me to believe I was getting the same quality for a reduced price. Not so. I also own several Gerber knives with which I am well pleased. Most of the recent Winchester products I have examined are playing off of a very old and respected line of weapons. The Winchester knife was correctly priced for the quality received. It is not a knife I will treasure or use very much.
2,Very disappointed!,"Very disappointed with this item! First, when the knife arrived it obviously had been a return from someone else because the plastic was sliced open and the knife had been removed before. But, my son really wanted this for Christmas, so I kept it because I had not been able to find another one anywhere else. It was a Christmas present, and the leather sheath broke on Christmas Day after wearing it only about 5 hours! However, my son was very happy with the knife, so now we are trying to find another sheath for it."
3,Gerber knife 22-01322,"It is OK. The price is good, the handle is too thin. Chinese handle designs are not as good as American designs. Nowere says that it is Gerber. Blade is fine."
1,pretensious,"While at first drawn into the lush visual imagery, I eventually found the poems, and long journal in the back, strikingly empty. Christopher seems to be a showman, constantly performing for the reader with too many sleights of hand and verbal somersaults. The basic premise of the journal is interesting, but Christopher takes the rumination of life and death to a cloyingly predictable, pretensious degree. The Dcotor, the driver are one dimensional figures trapped in Christopher's invention. The overall effect is a kind of patronizing and inaccessible work, where Christopher's characters are walking blindly through a universe of chaos, where the poet seems to mourn their darkness yet fail to illuminate much for the reader. A depressing combination, in part because the poet obviously spent a good deal of energy performing for the reader during what's essentially an empty journey."
4,Problem with DOLBY TrueHD!,"I played the disc on 2D bluray.My receiver ( Denon 4310 ) support the DOLBY TrueHD, but unfortunately theDOLBY TrueHD ""stage"" & ""Audiance"" on the disc were recognized ""only"" as Dolby Digital.Nevertheless, the sound was great.Interview of 60 minutes( bonus video )is too long.Extending the paying duration is preferred.bottom line - BUY IT!!!"
5,Surprized,"If you like campy, independant horror flicks, you should enjoy this one. Not too cheesy and not too serious- The acting is pretty good and the special effects are decent. The storyline is fairly well-developed for a movie of this nature. I thought the ending was very good. Also reccommended: The Seven Doors of Death and The Dead Hate The Living."
2,Low Budget Campy Horror,"If you're into cheesy horror films, then this movie is a good rental. If anything, you'll get your money's worth sitting around with a group of friends and laughing at the cheesiness of it all.Perhaps the only two good things about the film were Chris Harmony's acting and the gratuitous nudity!"
5,Not what you think-100X better!,"I bought this book because I needed some motivation in life and was expecting just that. What I got was a book that motivates, clarifies, and changes your perception, which if you think about it, when you are lacking motivation that is usually the cause. Each section, their are 100, tends to blow my mind in some way, and causes me to think-Wow! I have recommended this book to everyone I love. Do not call this a self help help book! This book clears the dust out of your mind and makes you feel a little bit superior, because you may be thinking better thoughts than the rest."
4,100 compelling reasons to keep getting up in the morning,"Steve Chandler is an insistent, unabashed optimist, in the same vein as Norman Vincent Peale. He covers 100 motivational tips that stretch the imagination, factor in the impact of technology, and challenge you to evaluate your situation from different points of view. The choices you make can either motivate you or hinder you, so he provides a wide array of tips you can embrace, reject, or simply read and digest. You can implement the games and exercises to make working toward your dream goal more fun. Though much of the content is basic and available in other self-help books, we recommend this breezy paperback; you can carry it in your briefcase and open it up randomly if you're feeling low and want to get rejuvenated and motivated."
5,very effective,"simple. states the obvious, but easily forgotten ways necessary to achieve success.very practical, with nice analogies and specific examples from life."
3,"Great ideas, but not an exhilarating listen","Steve Chandler's ideas are valid, and if listened to over and over again during your commute - you are bound to be motivated to make improvements in your life. These 100 ideas are just that, ideas - although he does back them up with interview and author quotes to reinforce the idea. I would not recommend to Steve that he record the next audio version of this book, because it is rather dull and monotone in its energy -- but, I am still glad I bought the tape - and I have noticed the difference."
3,Good Points but bad Audio,"I recently purchased this audio cd but was very disappointed with the readers voice (who is actually the author himself). In comparison to the subject matter which is this ""Go get 'em"" motivation ......the voice behind it was pretty bland, disappointing, and very drab sounding. Sometimes I found it difficult to want to continue listening to it because of that fact. Also, I actually had it playing in my office and people would immediately comment the same thing about his voice. The actual substance of the book is great and the 100 ways he lists, but I wished there was more energy and enthusiasm to the voice that was reading it to make it more impactful. The subject matter and reader's tone did not match. I also wished there could of been a print out list included with the cd of all the 100 ways he mentioned as a recap. I ended up jotting down notes myself."
4,"Easy to read, light, interesting and helpful","With less than 2 pages on the average for each of its 100 topics/ideas/tactics/life wisdom that allows for no bs nor sophisticated theories/concepts, this book can really motivate those down and depressed, like me, to get into action, the very first step to solve your whatever problem. Buy it and be ready to re-read it whenever your mood is low. Perhaps you can first borrow one from a library and for sure you will be tempted to buy one at once."
4,Good Listen While Driving to work,"While their is nothing new or earth shattering here, he does remind you of certain things you can do that if followed through with, will help you. But just as in all things, their is no miracle words that will motivate you. It all comes from within. A choice has to be made and then another one and another until you are a motivated person. Many people tell you how to motivate yourself, but none of them are telling you anything you don't already know.Its all a state of mind and this book is good in that it helps you to see that."
3,Yawn,"I'm glad many people were helped by this, but it's pretty much the standard motivational fare. Nothing new here, but I do look at these things as being of value if you can get just one new idea or perspective.What detracts, as others have mentioned, is that the author really needs to hire someone else to do the audio. Imagine Harrison Ford speaking slowly and without emotion, after not enough sleep and maybe two drinks too many - kind of a sleepy drunk monotone. This would be 10 times better if Tony Robbins was reading it."
1,Wake Me When It's Over!!,"Enticed by the title, I bought this audio to help me out of the slump I've been in. While there are some good suggestions, this guy is BORING! One of his suggestions to motivate yourself is to do 2 things that you dislike doing everyday--I guess so that you will enjoy the things you do like even more. It was this thought that motivated me to get through to the end of this tape"
3,motivating ways thru desmotivating voice !!,It's a very good audio cassette... The 100 ways are effective if you REALLY follow the instructions... but his voice... I couldn't believe it... thought my cassette player had a problem... You'd better buy the book !
4,Good ideas for finding what inspires you,"I love this book,it has so many great ideas about what keeps you motivated... and even though I believe motivation depends pretty much on each of us, it's great to have more reasons to stay focus and working through achieving our goals."
2,Goofy book for my Master's Program,"This is an OK book. It was required for part of my Master's Degree. I did not like the book. It is OK, but for use in the class, we hardly used it - which makes me dislike the book a bit more."
1,"The key in in the title: ""Yourself""","I listen to this CD several times a year. I gave the book away long ago, but I think I should buy one once a month and give it to someone who needs it. Lots of people understand this book because they understand the most effective tool left unused is worthless. Insights, many simple, put into practice will change your life. This is the gift of these thoughts. DO ONE or TWO and see if you are not changed. Four circles is my favorite; its easy and always puts a focus on the lifetime that exists within my day."
2,"Slightly disappointing, but effective...","I read the book first and was looking for a tape to back up the concepts in the book. On that count, the audio version is right on the mark. The interesting (and disappointing) thing is that the author actually ""reads"" the pertinent text to you from each of the 100 items. In the book, he talks about overcoming a fear of public speaking and putting inflection into his speaking voice. I guess he feels qualifed to ""read"" to us based on his accomplishment. If reading his text was the selected approach, he should have let a professional narrator make this tape. I guess I was expecting excerpts from his speaking engagements (ala ""7 Habits...""). Unfortunately, he sounds like Tom Boydette on the Motel 6 commercials. The content is there, the delivery is disappointing. If you have the book, make a tape yourself."
2,Superficial,"I found the content of the book very superficial. It deals with eliminating the symptoms of lack of motivation: things like ""Kill your television"", ""Read yourself a story""... (these are chapters titles from the book). Do not expect a deep philosophical of psychological insight about human motivation or even human nature in general from this book."
5,Shocked.,"I'm a reader of self-help since the 80's and am not usually shocked after reading a self-help book, but I am with this one, this book actually left me feeling happy, motivated and inspired. I can't say I feel that way every time I'm done reading a book, but with this one I was, so if your feeling stuck, lost or unhappy then this book may be for you. I Loved the format, short and to the point, great references, tips and ideas, it's a fast read, a book you can't put down."
4,Concise.,"One hundred ways to motivate oneself is really an overwhelming number, but there are some good nuggets in here if you like motivational tapes. Unlike other motivational tapes, this is truly a list, delivered by the author, whose voice and delivery are a little monotonous"
2,Review on the Audiobook only.,"The good is relatively good because it possesses some of the most important self-help concepts i.e Self-image. Now the Audio version sucks big time. It is supposed to motivate you, so I was going to use it as a morning booster of my energy and that ""feeling good"" mood. However, the author speaks as though he is just about to commit suicide from such a lethal depression or you can imagine him weighing 650 pounds lying on a bed not being able to hardly even speak. It actually was a so boring narration that I passed out. No energy. No motivation. No inspiration. Not at all. Get yourslef some Wayne dyer. BUT, I recommend you read the book."
5,100 Ways to Improve Your Life,"One could easily pass over this book by simply looking at the title. Chandler's suggestions will not just motivate you, if you follow them they can change your life. His suggestions are based on his own experience. He is passing on what has actually worked for him and his clients so his comments are rock solid. One of these suggestions is worth the price of the book"
5,the best,"This is the best book for motivation. It's easy to read, but the sentences keep in your mind for months (maybe for years) so you can practice them."
1,Overly complicated,"Being both a U.S. history buff and a mystery fan, I expected to love this book. I gave up after slogging through 150 pages. New characters (many with similar names) are introduced about every other page, making the story very difficult to keep straight. Benjamin January also brings a multi-layered backstory to the proceedings, adding additional layers of complexity (and does anybody else think a musician-surgeon-classically educated sensitive widower is a bit too good to be true?).Add a setting unfamiliar to most readers (an 1830s Creole sugar cane plantation), and the density of details overwhelms both plot and characterization. Casual readers will find this book tough sledding."
5,LOVE BARBARA HAMBLY,"For years, I have loved Barbara Hambly's fantasy novels, but wasn't sure how I would take to a non-fantasy from her. I shouldn't have worried - she has such a magical way with words that she could probably write a cookbook and make it spellbinding. Sold Down The River is the fourth book in the Benjamin January novels and, like the first three, will keep you up all night reading."
4,Sold down the River,I am interested in history of the old south and there were many different characters in the book that held my interest.
2,Too disturbing for most readers,"Written in a claustrophobic, stream-of-consciousness style, this is a portrait of a young woman deeply damaged by emotional and physical incest. The broken chronology and distorted perceptions make the reader feel as confused as the protagonist herself. I had to force myself to finish reading the book. It might have been worthwhile if there were some character development and resolution of the protagonist's psychological problems. Instead I was disappointed by an apparent happy ending that seemed forced and unbelievable. Marble Skin may be well-written (apart from the contrived ending), but it's certainly not enjoyable reading."
2,this cd is misnamed-it should be elo part2-no jeff lynne,"This cd is misnamed. It should not be called ELO but rather ELO Part2. This band does not contain Jeff Lynne, who was responsible for all of the songs on this cd. While ELO Part2 does contain several of the original members (ie. Bev, Mik, Kelly) the one member it misses the most is Jeff Lynne. If you are looking to buy this simply on the track list, don't, especially if you think this is the old ELO. If you already have heard some of the new ELO material then buy it because the songs are fresh. However, it does sound like a very good cover-band doing old ELO music."
5,atlanta/time,"A excellant CD/DVD single,from these extremely talented musicians,there stage performances like there music is exciting ,and an extravaganza .If you liked there follow up album SHINE these two extra tracks are BRILLIANT!too.A welcome addition for a devoted fan like myself of these dashingly beautiful talented ladies.GREAT MUSIC."
4,"Good video, Great Gift for new Parents","This video is an excellant video for new Moms and Dads, and in addition for anyone who will be helping with the newborn, to give Mom and Dad a break. The only drawback I found with the video was the length of the video. I wished it had gone into more detail , most specifically caring for the crying baby, and also, care of the baby up to 6 months. However, I can find no fault in this being a beginners tool for learning, and also, a refresher for us who have not taken care of an infant in many years. I purchased this video for first time parents. I wanted to watch it before giving it to make sure it would be something I would be glad to give as a present. I am glad and the parents were very happy to receive. See visually is great because reading is good but for those who are visual people, the instructions from this video will be more helpful. A great gift idea."
4,Nice info for young girls,"I bought this video for my eight-year-old daughter simply because she's so crazy about babies, and loves to see anything having to do with their care. Except for the close-up of that yucky tarry meconium being passed, it was a big hit. Info on bathing, diaper changes, feeding - she loved it. For most new parents (and certainly those who would be information-hungry enough to pay $20 for a video), most of the information was a little too simplified. Also, maybe it was just my copy, but some of the audio is fuzzy and tough to hear."
3,"Try the video ""The Happiest Baby on the Block""","""The Happiest Baby"" can teach any one EXACTLY how to calm their crying newborn in minutes...and help her sleep longer, too."
3,A good enough case but...,"I ordered 2 of these cases for my mom and I, who both play, and have two different clarinets: a Bundy and a Yamaha Advantage. When we put our clarinets in them, we noticed that the lower joint of the clarinet (the portion right above the bell that has the thumb rest attached to it) doesn't sit far enough in the molded portion to allow the lid to close without compressing the 4 lower keys. In fact it's about an inch or so from closing. We were leary about forcing it closed and so decided to return them. Mine (the Bundy) was closer to closing than my mom's Yamaha so know that if you have a Yamaha, those 4 keys sit higher. The case seems great and good quality and we loved the fact that it had a sheet music compartment. Unfortunately, our clarinets didn't like it =("
5,Good start,When I purchased my LRH Magic Molder I purchased this and several other plug profile cutters.One reason is I used this to find the centerline of the unit on my tablesaw with a zero clearance insert and also needed it for a profile in molding I am making. All profile cutters are sharp and cut well with no chatter. Nice product and well worth the money spent!
4,Magic Molder,Ordering was easy.Product came in a timely manner and was in excellent shape.Magic Molder Detail Patterns P-3Will keep this seller in mind for any future purchases.
4,Very fun!,I bought this for my 4-yr old but it seems that my 7-yr old plays with it more. Unfortunately they fight over the who gets to be Capt Hook. It is very fun. I bought two of the kits so they would have more pieces to play with. I wish I had bought the ship also.
2,Did not fit BCM carry handle,Just as the title says. This mount did not seat properly or at all on my BCM milspec carry handle. i think these are hit or miss.
5,Work great,I purchased one of these last year for a relative who lives abroad and she is very happy with it and uses it a lot. Her daughter who also has neck problems tried it and loved it too so this year I am sending one to her as well. Good stuff.
3,Good but does not keep cold long,"Pros: Good design that fits average size person well, pleasant to touch, does not require cover.Cons: Does not keep cold for very long, 15-20 minutes max."
1,Terrible Disappointment -- parts don't fit,"My son (almost 8) and my husband (an engineer) sat down to put this together. Many of the holes were either drilled too small or, even worse, drilled in the WRONG PLACE. Some pieces are cut the wrong size and just don't fit!! What a terrible WASTE OF MONEY. There is no way to make it work without major drilling and sanding and then re-painting.My son is so disappointed -- he was really looking forward to putting this together."
2,a MAJOR disappointment!,"I'm normally a big fan of Melissa and Doug products, but I can't believe I spent a single dollar on this toy. This is an assemble-it-yourself item, which is fine except...many of the holes did NOT match up (some were up to a HALF INCH off and looked as if a 3-year-old had drilled them). When I say drill, I mean that loosely, because some of the holes weren't even drilled all the way through. The showpiece of this toy is the fire truck ladder, but the ladder did NOT fit into the ladder holder...because the holes for the holder were drilled on the WRONG side of the truck! The only way to fix all the hole problems would be to take a power drill to it, but the wood is extremely soft, so you may end up shattering it. This is the worst quality control I've seen in a looooong time."
3,Not worth the cost,"My son received this for his 5th birthday, along with the Melissa & Doug Mighty Builder Tow Truck. They were both difficult to assemble because half of the pre-drilled holes did not match up. Once I was finally able to assemble it, a piece to the ladder broke off, it was only glued on. I have re-glued that same piece three times now before finally giving up and throwing the piece away. My boys still play with the toy, but only the base truck. The ladder portion never worked right and now has two broken pieces. There are so many other fire truck toys out there, don't waste your time with this one."
3,I would not get it again,Suprised by Melissa and Doug it was not greatly made for kids.It was not well made.Very difficult for kids to make it .. Needed adult help all the time and also string coming out all the time.
4,"Overall, I liked Rembrandt toothpaste. The only thing ...","Overall, I liked Rembrandt toothpaste. The only thing I didn't like about it is that there's no fluoride in the toothpaste. I also didn't get a fresh taste in my mouth after using it, although my teeth seemed whiter. I'd recommend it for whitening purposes."
5,tall stainless pasta canister is a must have,Excellent product for price. Great storage for long pasta products and is a sleek and updated design. I will buy more!!!
1,Didn't hold up.....very disappointed,"I bought this OXO Insight Tea Kettle tea after I'd let my former whistler boil dry. The whistling cover on the spout had been left in the ""UP"" position after filling and I totally forgot about it. Well, I thought, THIS teakettle had solved that problem for me. Just a squeeze of the handle causes the spout top to flip down into the spout. When the the kettle is set down and the handle released, the spout top closes. What a great idea!After just 6 months of light use, the spout top will no longer close. I am so disappointed. FYI, the whistle on it was great, not too irritating, but loud enough to get one's attention.I am on the hunt for a new teakettle. A stainless one with a non-irritating whistle --- some of these teakettles sound like a tornado siren."
5,Pumpkin sexy hair,"Love this product. My hair is soft and smells great. I looked everywhere for it but sadly, it has been discontinued."
1,gene hates jezebel,"i love JLJ but this compilation is so so, poor songs selections, who needs demo and bad alternate take anyway, avoid, only for die hard fan."
5,Very much worth the money!,Our daughter is 6yrs old and this is her 1st musical instrument! She has played none stop for the past 3 days and has already picked up the flash cards that came with the guitar. Next are guitar lessons!
5,A poignant book from the best!,"Roger Tory Peterson author and artist of many bird guides, writes a wonderful 'chapter book' with wonderful illustrations for the young. It brought back memories of my father, my first fellow birder. An excellent book!"
2,Poor quality,Poor quality - pieces do not fit well and are constantly falling apart. The most durable part is the container.
1,Nice toy but ...,"My six-year-old loves space and to get this he was so exciteded! However, as we assembled some of the shuttle and other things the taps and pins would break-off. Needless to say, now he can't put everything together to simulate launch from Kenedy Space Center because all the parts won't stay together."
1,Very low quality,"It's sad to see that the space toys based on the actual space program are not good ones. My son loves space and space exploration, but he hardly plays with this set. The shuttle does not stay on the tanks, even when sitting still.I like the fact that everything fits into a box. If only the toy were higher quality!I'd buy it again, but just for the fact that my son loves space and the space program so much."
5,Barely behaving,"This is a great read as everything written by Jennifer labrecque. This writter cautivates the reader through the whole story with sensuality and laughs.The moment veterinarian Niall Fortson spies Tammy Cooper sunbathing in the nude, he knows his new neighbor is naughty-and a knockout. With a bad reputation and a bad attitude, Tammy has trouble written all over her. And though Niall isn't looking for a scandal, he can't resist her. Luckily Tammy has a solution to cure them of their mutual case of lust-a two-week secret affair....before they were barely behaving!Tammy soon realizes the boy next door is almost more man than she can handle. And she's enjoying handling him -a little to much. After all, someone with her track record is all wrong for a guy dreaming of white picket fences. Still Niall's determined to be more to Tammy than just a boy toy. And with the way he makes her feel, Tammy's inclined to let him convince her..."
4,"Great play, very instructional","I loaded the VP2 disc and I have to tell you it's just like a pool hall without the smoke! If you're into pool at all, this game is for you. I don't recommend it for laptops that use mousepads, as the triggering of the cue stick involves a sweeping motion that, with a mouse is cool, but with your finger can be aggravating. I've tried it on both (who wouldn't want to take a pool table to work with them?) It's smooth and has a ton of virtual players and dozens of game options. The learning videos are well-done, and it's slightly addictive.There could have been more information to show you how to work the controls (no manual?!), but after a game or two, I was good to go. Could have done with a couple more backgrounds as well, though the ones there are serviceable. For general game players, I give it 4 stars out of 5. For pool players, 5 out of 5."
3,Brazilian family values,"This story of a libidinous mother (who has apparently never heard of birth control of any kind) living in the Brazilian backwoods presents some of the best and worst of Brazilian cinema. On the one hand: beautiful cinematography, which is no easy feat for a bleak landscape, and authenticity in sets, dialogue and characters. On the other hand: the seemingly obligatory depiction of squalor both physical and moral, and a storyline that only intermittently entertains. Sinto muito, but the film so merece tres estrelas."
2,slow moving and boring,"I've seen quite a few brazilian flicks. To prove the point at hand, it's just obvious and very slow moving. The plot is not very intriguing.. not what I expected."
1,Totally Tasteless!!,"Do not waste your time on this loser about an irresponsible woman who has kid after kid & then wonders why she is poor! The only thing you can say is ""Please--somebody get her to a birth control clinic fast before she has another one!"""
4,"So many men, so much time.","Darlene de Lima is jilted at the church with her infant son, so she gets on a truck and leaves the poor village of her mother. Three years later she returns, marries a prosperous old godger, and settles down to support him as he relaxes, endlessly, with his old radio in his hammock. Unwittingly, he never gives her any attention, so one by one, she finds men who adore her free, sensual spirit and move in with Darlene and her husband. This is a fun film based on a real person in Brazil. An unexpected little gem."
5,"Terrific plot and acting, wise and warm - a classic!","I never write raves. But this is a very underestimated film. The screenplay is spare and polished. The actors - sublime. Regina Case is amazing in this role. Should have won all kinds of awards. Completely absorbing. Best film I've seen in a long time.No violence, restrained sex - real life, with somebody you are really rooting for."
2,movie,"I love this movie and i received it in good shape, however the shipping was awful, I paid for expedited shipping and it still arrived late/ It took a 1 1/2 weeks to arrive."
3,Good Beggining,"Overall I'm not crazy about this EP. It definetley has things I like on it though and was a sign of what was gonna come in the next two albums Public Warning and Jigsaw. She's very talented in my opinion and is already a lot better than most out there. I admit to not being much of a rap fan either. Lady Sov of course is really under the british grime style though if I have facts straight. Random is a great track as is A Little bit of Shhhhh. The only track I'm not crazy about is The Battle, and I'm not overly taken by the remix for Random and one or two others. A good album but only need to get it if you're a completeist and want to round out your collection. If you buy the version with the DVD that gives a behind the scenes look it's definetley worth it. It's fun to get a look at the biggest midget behind the mic."
1,I opened the CD and there was nothing inside,Beauty and truth are sadly sobbing in the shadows. Music for people with too much time on their hands.
5,AWESOME,"i hate american rap. it is so lame. it was hot when it first came out like 25 years ago, now its just lame. now Uk heads are making this sick grime stuff overseas, i think US needs to watch out and rethink where we are heading."
2,hip hop?,"oh please, however catchy the beats are do not call her music hip hop,for some one who has been listen to it for years, calling her music hip hop is an insult."
1,this is WACK it deserves no stars,I would like to know what type of people are writing these reviews and what state of musical knowledge they have i've never written a review but after reading what these plutocrates have wrote i have to respond this cd is on par with Ant and Dec its terrible she waffles on with an annoying high piched voice about english mcs sounding american then she tries to sound like a cracked out missy elliot who also is terrible she has absolutely zero talent and im amazed she has a record deal its borders on treason that shes allowed to hold a mic
3,Uncover well-hidden historical truth,"This DVD is not available on Netflix. Why? The real question is: how come you can buy it on Amazon? I think, it was mistakenly released by someone who was not aware of its true nature. Several similar movies are still not available. They all show how FDR's administration viewed Stalin and Stalinism. Watch it and think!"
1,To Paraphrase Cordell Hull. . .,"In all my years of viewing movies, never have I encountered a film laced with such infamous falsehoods and distortions on a scale so huge, that until today I never believed a studio was capable."
1,Waste Of Money,"Followed the instructions just like it said. My pictured all came out in a pinkish-red, had tothrow the cartdridge away. A big waste of time and money. I wont buy it again."
4,'Refill system',"Product was received in due time. The postage for this item was very expensive, raising the cost of the product beyond that which I would have been able to purchase at a local computer store."
2,Left wanting to hear more . . .,"The photography in the book is great. I also liked the history on the breed. I was, however, disappointed by the minimal information in the book about the breed's temperment, personality and the pluses and minuses of the breed. I was yearning for more information about this. The second half of the book is devoted to the typical puppy information that was very generic and has been written about in almost every dog book I've read. Anne, next time give us more!!"
2,Care of TT,This book tells more about the history of the breed than the care and what to except when you adopt a TT. I really wanted to know more about the nature and personality and how to care for them. So I was disappointed. A breeder recommended Tibetian Terrier by Jane Reif. I may try that book.
3,"great photographics, generics",Its a very good book for new commers also for other breeds but not for breeders. Why are not included the opinions of other breeders? It hase also commercial announcements I dont like that.
3,"No deep characters, average story line","This book is a nice and easy read - but maybe I was expecting more of a story line than I got. Also, the end is so obvious from the beginning that the plot is completely self-contained. The characters are truncated in the sense that they move from ordinary behavior to rage in a sentence (the father, for instance). I liked the description of the dead mother, though - she doesn't say a word throughout the book (well, she is indeed dead) but the feelings and descriptions given to her by both grandmother and daughter were so strong and elaborated that they ended up bringing her as the most real character in the book."
2,depressive,"it's kinda ok, but quite depressive. With the way the things are today, I don't really want to read about other people's suicide thoughts. But on the other hand, the book is well written and certainly well researched."
2,really disappointed,"Sorry - I try really hard to read every book I start, but I could not finish this one. I found it predictable, silly, and it was not compelling or skilled. The writing was amateurish."
4,A brief glimpse of Chinese philosophy.,"Three Ways of Thought in Ancient China is a book that opens the door to Chinese philosophy. Some of the writing may be familiar, such as Confucius while other lagalist writing sounds more Machiavellian. A good book for an introduction to Chinese philosophy, much of it reads like poetry."
3,Fascinating although off topic at times,"I found this book very fascinating. It explores the various human cognitive processes through examples. These examples are basically constructed through a single mental experiment, the Black Cylinder Experiment. However, in my opinion, the final conclusion drawn in this book is on quite a tangent from the discussions throughout most of the book, but the discussions were necessary."
1,Misleading Title.,"This book's title and its thesis ""seem"" to suggest that it is all about the impact of people on politics, but in fact it is about feminism. The topic, feminism, is fine; anything under disguise is not.It is not quite an academic book with logical arguments but rather a propaganda with a few claims that are appealing accompanied by loads of emotional examples exposing the unfairness of this world which do nothing to strengthen the previous claims."
3,What was she Thinking??,"I love Vandi, but this ""album"" is bellow her normal ablitities. The album translated some of her biggest hits in Greece, with English lyrics that don't make sense. I think Fivos is trying to rhyme too much. She talks about the flavor of chewing gum, and wonder lady. It seems as if he was writing a song and just pick words that match, but don't flow together. If she is serious about an international career she should work with people that will make her sound amazing. She is a great singer in Greek, but the way she sings in English is a little annoying. I don't know maybe I was expecting something better from Vandi. The album combined translations of Greek hits, and some of her Greek hits. It seems as if the album was just thrown together. It's like we have a huge hit ""Gia"" and some other English songs, ""Come Along Now"" and ""Opa Opa"", lets make an international album. Vandi should be embarrassed that her name is on this album."
3,Not very Good,"Three stars because he made the best he could but not five because he couldn't he refute JW's. In chapter seven pages 119-120 beginning in paragraph 3 of page 119 he stars claiming that God does not give us a reason as to why he created Satan or that God gives man a fathomable reason for choosing one person to salvation and rejecting another to eternal punishment. First of all, it is true that God does not always give us reasons for doing things his way or that we even deserve such reasons. However, he does give it to us many times and sometimes we can try to understand why. If he chooses to give salvation to one and not to another it's obvious that person is a righteous man according to the bible. Like all apologists he bases his evidence on misinterpretation and lack of knowledge of the scriptures."
2,Long lists of Ant methods,"This books main failing is that it ends up with Pages of listings of the methods that you can use in Ant which is not really why one buys a book in my opinion. The book feels padded and does not have the feeling of a reference text that a team would use; rather it is functional and dry. However, it does cover all the major aspects of Ant so it's not a complete loss."
4,Good but needs some more explanation,"I have been reading this book for a couple of weeks and have found it very helpful in my journey towards understanding Java Development. There are lots of examples and the book is generally very readable.I do have a critiscism though. The book in some area's could have done with a little bit more detail in its description of some of the tasks provided by ANT. For example in it's covering of the <apply> task the use of the <mapper>, <srcfile/> and <targetfile/> tasks within the context of the <apply> task was only 2 sentences. Although the authors had covered <mapper> in a previous chapter they could have discussed them a little bit more in the context of thier use within the <apply> task. I had to sit down and work out how to use them rather than relying on a clear explanation by the book.All in all though I have found this book helpful and I now feel as if I understand ANT quite well."
5,Still an excelent book,"Almost in each project which I write I find this book to be valuebale.If you are willing to put more time on ant than just to know the trivial parts, than you must read this book, no matter what.You will learn how ant works on all types of projects (web, EJB, web services etc...).D. Orbach[...]"
5,The Worst Witch Collection - very nice short stories.,"Very nice stories. Liked the 3-volume box set. Wish it came in DVD format. Nonetheless, it is a great product. Enjoyed very much. Sincerely, L."
4,Great movie for kids!,"The Worst Witch (The Movie)The Worst Witch Collection - Set 2I bought this movie for my 5 year old daughter, because I remember how much I liked it when I was a kid. She loves this movie, along with my 3 year old daughter, so I bought them the set of the series, and they really enjoy that too. Of course, now my daughter is always making ""potions"" and trying to get her older brother to drink them. I love movies that bring out a childs imagination."
5,The best reference for medical transcriptionists.,"Since I am new at transcription, I needed a great reference book to be at my side. This book is great because its sections are in alphabetical order - if you need to find out the correct spelling for ""mid portion"" you simply turn to the ""M"" section, and there is ""mid"" and the different and correct uses for the word. I have used this book frequently and I haven't seen a book for transcription that has been this useful."
5,Easy to use and very informative!,I was surprised by how easy this book is to use. I can very quickly find the information I need and get back to work. I love having the AAMT style guidelines at my fingertips!
3,AAMT Book of Style,I ordered this book but never got to use it much. But it is good to have for future reference.
1,Item Not Available,"This item was out of stock, so I did not receive it. However, I received timely notification from Amazon.com."
3,Not bad...but could be better!,"I received this 'Don't Go' single from Amazon...couldn't wait to get home and give it a listen. In general...the tunes aren't bad, however.....they've lost much of the older, early 80's feel to them. They sound much too modern. A lot of remixing...if you're looking for modern dance stuff...this is a great CD.* note * There is also an import version of 'DON'T GO' available."
5,Time Life Presents: Soul Celebration Vol. 2,Yes I enjoyed it very much. Yes I would recommend this to someone. I am a fan of old school.
1,RETURNING IT,"We bought this as well as the Elenco electric sets thinking it would be the same.It's cheap, the parts and wires are sharp and it's not even worth the shipping.The Elenco sets are great!"
4,Electronic 50...,"I love the book that comes with it. I tried one of those mail order courses, and it nearly crushed my love of electronics. I didn't try and for a while. I decided to try it with smaller kits instead. This starts off like that course did, and I seem to remember something from it. This is far better though. I'm nervous about trying to start soldering. This kit doesn't include soldering (that I know of anyway). The durability is horrible though. It should be on a sturdier frame, and a better battery holder."
3,Fabulous Toy! But cheaply made.,"We got this for Christmas, for my 8 year old son who is a budding electrician. He loves circuits and is familiar with Elenco products. He was so excited to get this, and pretty quickly figured out how to use it. It is definitely one of the most educational toys out there for engineer-wannabes, and the projects were fun.But I am sorry to say that it is very cheaply made. The base is a thick cardboard rather than plastic, so it easily tears. In fact, we ripped the battery flap almost immediately, even though we knew to be careful. Nothing a little strong tape couldn't fix, but considering that this toy is supposed to be tinkered with, it really needs to be made stronger to last awhile."
4,"Good, clean fun","The body of the kit feels a little cheap and fragile -- particularly since its aimed at kids. However, I'm sure they did this to keep the price down, and it IS a pretty good price. My 6 year old son and I have been having fun learning about electricity and doing experiments based on the instructions included."
3,Looks Stained,"DS's drink spilled a little on the sheet, after washing it, it stilled looked stained. I think I would go with a darker color, this sheet stains easily beware...."
2,Hard to believe,"I don't believe that a writer wrote only one story and all others 15 weren't written by him and everybody says that is a good book and a good writer.All the stories are predictable and alike, if you read them all together at the end of the third one you will know the end of the rest of them only by reading the beginning, if you read these stories between books (one or two each time) may be you will enjoy the book, but maybe also you already read most of them before you read this book."
3,Twisted Could Use a Few More Twists,"Unfortunately, the main flaw of this book is that most of the stories are nearly identical. I'd say that 75% of them deal with a husband or wife planning to kill their spouse, and then the tables get turned and the good guy ends up being the bad guy. Also, the characters from each story are so similar that they all blend together. They're all middle-class suburban WASPs without much personality, and no real reason to care about any of them. The stories themselves aren't bad, but they sure aren't great, either. There are one or two stand-outs which truly did surprise me at the end, but with the other stories I found myself either knowing the plot twist long in advance or just not caring about what happened to any of the characters. This is one of those so-so books which you can read on the plane or at the beach and then forget about."
5,Deliciously inventive and surprising,"What a treat this collection is.Deaver is lke a masterful pitcher who keeps changing speeds and spins to keep you off balance. Almost every one of these stories delivers a twist that is deliciously inventive and surprising. As a previous reviewer wrote, ""Triangle"" is particularly clever.My least favorite was the Lincoln Rhymes Christmas tale, which was too long and sentimental. But that's a small quibble. Overall, Deaver succeeds marvelously."
5,nice,"I liked this. I read it twice & gave it to a friend to read. It had some surprising endings, and what I liked best was I didn't have to read through lots of details to get to them."
5,A treat and another star in Deaver's crown for this,"O.Henryesque anthology of short and yes, very twisted and unique short stories. Each one can stand alone; yet packaged and tied with a bow in this manner, they give the reader a present that opens anew with each and every turn of the page.If you imagaine that you can outwit this author and surmise what the twist will be, you have another think coming. How versatile Deaver is in his range of scenarios, in his wild and wonderful surprise endings; in his choice of characters and his imaginative prose!I recommend this collection to anyone who wishes to be entertained, enlightened and absolutely thrilled to the bone. An exciting and memorable read by the author who has easily soared to first place on my list. I had just finished his 'Speaking in Tongues' when I picked up 'Twisted' and was given hours of reading bliss. Don't miss any of Jeffrey Deaver's works; he is truly gifted!"
2,Not as good as his full length books,"I am a big fan of Jeffrey Deaver, I think he is very clever and original in his work, and deserves the readership that he has garnered over the last few years.Yet this collection did little for me. I tried to like the stories and they were at times ok, but I just found myself trying to guess the sting in each tale and not really relating to the story at all. The stories were not enough for me to get involved and to care about what was happening.This is for the ultra-serious Deaver fan, while others would do better to look at his Lincoln Rhyme series which are brilliant."
3,"Above-average collection, with a few gems","I'd read several of Deaver's novels before I learned about this collection. While I've enjoyed most of the Lincoln Rhyme series, I've always felt that his other novels left me feeling 'flat', and somewhat disconnected from the stories and characters.I noticed that with several of the entries in 'Twisted', although a few, notably 'The Weekender', 'For Services Rendered', 'All The World's A Stage', and 'The Fall Guy', had very good payoffs.Most of the rest, including the Lincoln Rhyme Christmas story, were simply 'OK', with nothing truly memorable about them.'Triangle' and 'The Kneeling Soldier', among others, could have rated higher, but the twists were the result of too many convenient, or simply implausible, coincidences.Deaver does his best work when he doesn't try to hard to do 'contrived' setups for a hit-or-miss 'payoff' at the end."
1,Visioneer doesn't honor its warrenty,My visioneeer scanner broke down after 3 months of use ... Visioneer isn't standing up to its warrenty claims.
2,"Good Scanner, no drivers, no support.","I bought this scanner because of the simplicity and ease of use. But after less than a year, the scanner became practically useless. Scans would take up too much disk space, copies were crappy and the software was confusing to configure and use. Also, Visioneer software loads itself into memory at boot up and slows down system performance. It would not operate properly on certain Windows operating systems and worst of all, Visioneer would not provide new driver for it. Also, though Visioneer makes a decent scanner, despite the flaws, they do not provide any support that is easy on inexpensive to access. You cannot email them, there is no 800 number and the long distance number that you must call has a significant wait time at your expense."
5,Pravana Leave-In Treatment is a necessity for me.,"My step daughter introduced me to Pravana Intense Leave-In Treatment several years ago and I've been hooked on it ever since. I have dry, natural wavy hair that is frizzy when it's humid outside. Pravana helps control these frizzies. Several of the girls I work with complained of static when brushing their hair so I gave then samples of my Pravana. They too are now faithful users. Oh, and it smells wonderful!!!"
1,good product no service,I have purchased this product before and it is a great product but the company I bought it from STILL has not sent it to me. I emailed them and still no response. I bought it beginning of Sept and I STILL have not received it
5,"Detangles My Long, Thick, Wavy Hair","It really did a great job detangling my hair, actually better than most other products I have tried. I like how it makes my hair feel soft without weighing it down."
2,Don't bother...,"It did nothing for me! I have just bleached my hair and was looking for something ""intense"" but this isn't it! It really didn't help with smoothing or detangling, I wouldn't buy this, I much prefer 'it's a 10'."
3,"Reasonable film, but not the story of Beowulf","I rented this on VHS a while back, expecting to see something fairly close to the classic story. It isn't, not even nearly. The film The Thirteenth Warrior (Antonio Banderas) is a closer telling of the tale, and a better film.The film itself stands adequately on its own merits, although it's not much more than adequate. Christopher Lambert rides around on a horse and struts around in armor, while some unknown terror stalks around the basement of a castle. The castle is surrounded by more men with armor and horses, who don't want anyone to enter or leave it, although they're only moderately successful. Eventually there's a big fight, and the good guys win..."
3,"Great expectations, bad experience","When I got this movie for Christmas I thought: ""I'm really looking forward to watch this movie!"". I exepected too much.The first part of the movie was good enough, especially the music. But I was soon enough annoyed by the unrealistic technology. I thought this was supposed to be a medieval movie and as far as I know they didn't have autoreloadable crossbows, speakers and microphones, laserscopes, elevators and a man in a brown coat (of the modern type) wearing glasses!! Now, don't mistake me, I have nothing against black people, but I wonder what two black men was doing in an European mediaval world?The good things about the movie are some sceenes which can be quite exiting and the one who playes Beowulf is quite good.If you want good fantasy/medieval movies I recommend the Thierteenth Warrior, Merlin, Lord of the Rings or Dragonheart."
1,"Good Story, Bad Writing, Bad Acting, Bad Directing","And worst of all was the techno music, which in no way fit the setting of the film."
4,THE SOUND TRACK IS THE BEST !!,THE MOVIE WAS GOOD IN ALL SENCE OF GOOD. IT WAS DARK AND HAD A KILLER SOUND TRACK THAT I WANT TO GET. THE FILM COULD OF USED SOME MORE GORE. IT HAD GREAT ACTION AND A GOOD PLOT. BUT THE SOUNDTRACK IS WHAT DEFINETLLY MADE ME WATCH IT FOR THE THIRD AND FOURTH TIMES.
1,I want my [money] back!,"I was the only one in my senior English class who loved the epic poem. Several years later I bought a copy of it at a comic book shop.For some reason, I liked Christopher Lambert, and I thought he would be a good actor for a movie based on this classic tale.Man, was I wrong!Aside from the names of the hero and one of the villians, this movie has almost nothing in common with the poem. It's got nothing in common with a good movie. It's a travesty!The acting, even with a so-called ""top talent"" like Christopher Lambert, is awful. The setting is almost non-existant, and the plot, ah yes, the plot ....I knew this movie would reek within the first 10 minutes. I mean, I tried really hard to be open-minded, but it was to no avail.Spare yourself the pain and skip the movie. Settle in on a dark winter's night by a fire, put on some quiet music, and read the epic poem. You'll be glad you did."
1,This Film Was a Waste of Time,"I agree with the reviewer who said, ""Read the book."" Or better yet, see Thirteenth Warrior, which is another fanciful rendition of this myth.Yeah, it's a B movie. It even has glimmers of interesting character development and plot line in it. But it's also-as one reviewer recognized--a pseudo video game, an imitation of an imitation of a life. It's a hostile, cretin, pubescent violence fantasy, festering in a cracked mirror. Beowulf, in the original tale, saved people from the monsters and nobly sacrificed himself. In this moronic film, he is a sociopathic ""swiss-army-knife"" who wants us to feel sorry for him. BEOWULF, the film, is gratuitous violence run amok. Who is the real monster in this film? Who really cares if the main character gets et? Everybody, not just mostly everybody, should have died in this film. They were all despicable."
1,bad,"This is a pretty bad movie. It was only 90+ minutes and it seemed like forever. The sets are pretty good and some of the action scenes are as well. That is about all that is good. The special effects are bad...laughingly so at the end. There is no character development and most of the actors don't even bother to act (such as the king). There isn't much plot, except near the end. You spend the whole movie wondering when the actual story will begin. It canabalizes the Beowulf legend to the point where the only thing in common is some monster killing everyone. And while they claim it is a ""technofuture"" its really just a medieval setting with some props forced in (like a loudspeaker in a stone castle). You'd be much better off watching The 13th Warrior."
2,Beowulf films,"I liked the 13th Warrior, at least they tried to recreate the world that actually existed, but in reality it was based on a novel by Michael Crichton called Eaters of the Dead, not Beowulf. Making a film version of Beowulf in the time it existed would be possible, but with no help from the poem. It's images of lands and places are sparse. The original poet liked to describe the insides of rooms, gold, gifts, weapons, battles and skirmishes, but the setting is very sparse, the filmmaker must supply his own image of the setting. I agree however, that this was not the setting the film needed, it suffered as a result. F/X can't make up for poor writing, nothing can, which is exactly why you shouldn't see this film. I was disappointed that Chris Lambert would condescend to play such an empty role in a film that is like a small child with anemia, there's not much hope for it."
2,Does Anyone Read?,"I'm sitting here reading these reviews and wondering if anyone even read the description on the back of the box about this movie. Over and over people are commenting on the technology that is present in the movie. Well, if certain people had takent the time to read the synopsis on the back cover, one would find that this moves takes place in a futuristic setting. There are some remanants of technology left, but most of it has been left behind in a ""muted past"".I didn't find this movie to be a masterpiece, but it was enjoyable for at least a night's rental. Christopher Lambert is just wooden throughout and does his best job at being Mad Max, but just does not pull it off. The character Kyra is tough and really is the only believable person in the movie. What I did like about the movie was the setting, the costumes, the weapons, and overall bleak post apocolyptic vision of the future."
1,"Bad movie, bad writing, bad everything","Ok, where to start with this piece of junk. Christopher Lambert sleep-walks through his scenes and the other actors take their queue from him. The soundtrack his pure heavy metal with no real link to the scenes. The set is minimalist to say the least - pipes and natural gas flames do not make a set. Writing was atrocious, directing was even worse if that is possible.This movie is just one more reason that Hollywood should not be allowed to touch a classic written story. Read the classic Anglo-Saxon story, but don't get this movie. Avoid at all cost."
2,It is a Lambert movie,"Bad special effects. Lambert looked bored at times. The plot has a few holes. Too much cleavage. Bad fight scenes. Beowulf can do multiple black flips and spin in the air and yet the monsters can still hit him! The fact that Grendel's mother is pregnant doesn't really play into the movie, but they keep bringing it up. It is not the worst movie I have ever seen and I pretty much got what I expected so I'm not completely trashing it. The weapons were cool."
2,It's just a movie...,"There's two ways you can watch this movie:#1 - as a film rendition of the great epic poem of the same name.#2 - as a cheesy action flick.Once you settle into watching this movie as #2, you'll be Ok. If you expect this to be Beowulf (""t ws god cyning!""), you'll be severely disappointed, as the movie seems to just borrow a few key ideas from the poem, but goes on it's own from there.It took me about 10 minutes to stop looking for parallels between the movie and the poem, and when I stopped doing that, I was finally able to settle into watching the movie.I wouldn't buy this movie, but I rented it, and for $5, it kept me busy for a couple of hours."
3,Arthouse (or low budget) alternative vision of the Beowulf story,"I must admit, I love this film, while acknowledging that it is not a great film. Christopher Lambert has a tendency to pick offbeat roles (such as The Sicillian) but they are quite charming nonetheless. Only about half the movie is really based on the beowulf story, and it has odd modern touches which make it look like ""Heavy Metal"" magazine (if you remember it). This is obviously shown up on budget and special effects by the 2007 film of the same name, yet for some reason I still like this one. It has a kind of campy gothic theme, think David Lynch's Dune version. Go in with low expectations and you might enjoy it."
2,for sci-fi fan; not English teachers,"This version of Beowulf is perfect for those who enjoy Sci-Fi movies; however, if you are searching for a classroom supplement to the epic poem, this selection is not for you"
1,Yeesch,"I'm convinced that this is the worst movie ever made. I rented it because it sounded like it might have been remotely interesting but it wasn't even that. The story was godawful, the acting was worse and the effects were comical. So instead of purchasing this film, do yourself a favor. Take the money you were going to spend on the tape, buy a torch and a metal hanger, heat the hanger with the torch and beat yourself senseless. It would be infinately more enjoyable than watching this movie."
2,Not bad,"I only saw this movie because Patricia Velazquez is in it. Lets put it this way her small scene in the beging is really the only scene worth watching. I think Christopher Lambart is a first class actor the story is wonderful and so is the sets and music. The audience has to almost help make the story because it seems like the movie is either in future of in the past its hard to say, the movie is based on a 18th century poem and the way people dress and the way they live seems to be from the past but then there is the little thing of having zippers, lighters, and so on and so. I don't understand either that only one person in the movie has an english accent shouldn't they all? In all i found the movie hard to understand you have to watch it a couple of times and read allot about it on the internet to undertstand it."
1,Stink! Stank! Stunk!,"Unbelievably stupid and inane. Chris Lambert has the acting ability of a limp dish rag. If you haven't seen a pseudo-martial arts film that spends most of its time having the actors sommersault backwards again and again and again and again to a soundtrack filled with WHOOSH! WHOOSH! WHOOSH! WHOOSH!, then this film is for you. And the fact that this film is based on what is considered the first English language literary classic is sacrilegious. Everyone associated with this film should be subjected to that huge single-edged razor blade used to separate people shown in the beginning of the film. This goes down in my books as one of the biggest bombs of all time. And Chris Lambert is positively laughable as an actor. Bar this man from acting!! Trash this film or--better--use it to prep people in how NOT to make a film."
4,Its not made to be a classic...,"C'mon really, why else would you buy the movie other than to see a bunch of crazy post-apocalyptic slicing and dicing?!? If you're looking for a epic battle film that will go down as a classic for its acting and storyline, buy Braveheart. If you want a film that doesn't expect you to consider the laws of physics while watching (let alone picking out all the flaws), buy this. Its a good, entertaining movie if you're interested in ""Mortal Kombat"" type movies or if you're a fan of ""Highlander""... if you're looking for Oscar material, you've got the wrong film. They shouldn't be put on the same level."
3,Good Action Movie With Midevil Fantasy Twist,"It wasn't as good as I had hoped, but it was better than I feared it could have been. Nothing embarassingly awful about it, just a good action flick."
5,Perhapsnotwhatyouexpected......,"As a recent ""first time listener"" to this piece (shame on me), I was most pleasantly impressed. I expected the music to be more challenging to the ear. That's usually just fine but the dominance of melody in the songs definitely wasn't a hard thing to handle. Each song seems to have its own individual approach - superb orchestrations by the legendary Mr. Bedford, some tender balladry, some Frank Zappa stylings, some blaring ""War of the Worlds"" horns (after all, we MUST have a few challenging parts). Well worth repeated listenings. I know that for long time fans of this music, the alternate song versions are deservedly welcome, but I would have wished for some unreleased original studio material."
3,BROWN BORE SUMMER,"It is obvious very quickly that the author is an academic and not a writer. I didn't think it was possible to turn the spectacle of Mc Neil River falls and it's dozens of grizzlies into a dull, lifeless narrative, but Thomas Bledsoe has managed to accomplish the feat. If you're in search of a well written book capturing the excitement of being surrounded by bears in Alaska, you will be disappointed. This reads almost like a textbook for a class you wished you hadn't signed up for."
5,wow really good songs,I didn't think there is any good rock coming out new anymore this new Saga cd is really good. well musicianships really good and the songs I was surprised how good the songs are. they are still putting out good music which is why nobody will hear it cuz if you have talent and if you play good it won't be heard. you play like you don't know what you're doing then you make money I'm glad I got this saga cd if your a fan of good songs good musicianship or saga you'll love this CD
1,"OK, really now...","How can anyone like this garbage? I just listened to the song Money Talks with a few friends and we agreed that it was one of the poorest written songs we've ever heard. The overuse of keyboards sounds like something out of a bad video game, only with lots of rainbows and flowers and stuff. But the vocals, man, the VOCALS! The guy sounded like he was getting pleasure from discussing the way that money talks to him and he does what it wants! Sounds like he's looking for a profession in the red light district if you ask me. Howabout they take time off and never get caught... it's all part of the game! In fact, take a lot of time off. In fact, stop ripping off Marillion with a touch of RuPaul and Prince and never write another album again!"
5,Through the Narrow Gate,"In ""Through the Narrow Gate,""Karen Armstrong gives a poinant description of the 7 years that she spent in a convent. She entered an especially austere order with precepts based upon the military, predicated upon Victorianism, upon the misoginy inherent within the patriarical structure of the Catholic Church, upon a revered masochism, and upon a form of brain washing meant to destroy the ego of a novice, supposedly in order to fashion that novice's personage into a more humble, more devout entity. Ms. Armstrong herself is not harshly critical of the Church or of the particular order, but readers no doubt will come to these crucial judgments themselves. We can only rejoice that such contorted religious training has been abolished."
5,Through the Narrow Gate,"This book is very simply written but portrays the joy and difficulty of being a religious sister at the time this young woman entered. Since I was a religious and left, I found a lot of what she said helpful in validating my experience."
2,Mixed emotions,"I enjoyed this book for it's view into the cloistered life of a nun- pre-Vatican II era, but the problems I perceived from the author's vocation seems to have resulted more from personality conflicts and clashes than anything. I couldn't relate effectively to her plight and wondered why she stayed as long as she did. I was also bewildered by her declaration that she didn't believe in the resurrection of Christ. I'm still scratching my head over that one since she obviously believed in the virgin birth (which requires alot of faith as well) and the divinity of Christ or else why the heck was she there in the first place??? I think there was more going on in her head when she decided to leave the convent than she leads us to believe, especially considering her more recent books like The History of God. I think maybe one of the mother superiors in her book had it nailed when she said that karen had a problem with intellectual pride."
2,Too Predictable,"The mystery was almost non-existent. The answer occurred to me 3/4 of the book sooner than the heroine. The characters, however, were great fun and with a little better ""mystery"" could be really enjoyable."
4,definitely cheesy,"More mystery than romance. Not necessarily for you romance readers out there. The characters in this unusual story are trying to solve several disappearing cases--apparently happening during magic shows. A wild assortment of people join together to find the disappearees and the one or thing responsible. What gives this novel four stars? Well, it's so goofy that it's funny."
4,Love these books!,"After reading this one, I went and bought all the others available, through Book 5 I believe. Tight writing, fun heroine, mostly plausible plot, interesting ending. Reminded me a little of 1940s Noir with the character's names. Can't wait to see where the author goes in the rest of the series. Esther isn't all hung up on getting a man throughout the book either. She actually wants to find the kidnapper because she may end up being accused of the kidnappings, instead of becoming limp with anticipation of seeing her love interest."
4,Fun light magical romp,"Light but entertaining magical mystery. Magician assistants are disappearing all over N.Y. and it's no illusion. Actress Ester Diamond quickly adjusts to the amazing realization that magic is real and sets out to solve the mystery behind the disappearances so that her big break shot at stardom won't be her final role. Ester pulls together an unlikely group of cohorts to solve the mystery and tries to resist the hunky detective who suspects Ester knows more of what is going on then she is willing to share. This was a fun romp, nothing heavy or serious, with zany characters, but entertaining enough to look for the next one in the series when it comes out."
4,High Mystery with some Cool Magic,"I really enjoyed the ""cast"" of the book, mainly the ""crew"" with the super-old guy as the fighter of evil with the help of the very smart and Agatha-Christie-like heroine. She's the kind of young woman you want at your side, really a role model as a great friend, and she ends up helping strangers. I think this is a good scifi/paranormal read for any age. I was amazed at her organizational skills (decidedly usually reserved for male roles) and tenacious adherence to solving the mystery. If you like Poirot, Murder She Wrote, and X-Files, you will love this book"
4,Fun fantasy style imitator of Janet Evanovich,"The show must go on. Least that has been the performer's credo, but when magician's assistants start disappearing--yes, almost on a nightly basis--Esther Diamond skips out on doing the 'disappearing act' in her current production. Instead she goes to work with 300 plus year old sorcerer, Max Zadok, to try and find who is making these women disappear. As the incidences pile up, Esther and Zadok acquire quite a team of helpers, including a crew of transvestites, a cowboy and a socialite magician. While this does make for a varied and interesting cast, there are far too many toss-off lines and too much repetitive dialogue. For those of you who have read Janet Evanovich's Stephanie Plum novels, ""Disappearing Nightly"" is definitely a pale copy. If you are into fantasy, go ahead and read the book, but add Evanovich if you want some truly hilarious mystery stories."
4,Nice,"Has a nice heft and balance. Handle is comfortable. Non-stick coating seems pretty thick and works. Coudn't give 5 stars because of the care the non-stick needs, must be handwashed, no metal utensils, no high temps. I am also a bit dissapointed with the amount of time it takes to to heat, probably due to thick non-stick coating. For what I bought it for, frying one or two eggs, it is great."
1,Package fine; pan bent or warped and they shipped it anyway!,"I would assume whoever packages these items, looks at them -- this should be a round pan -- not a dented pan. The box was not damaged, airpacks around the pan. Pan has a serious dent -- not a minor dent. Watch what you buy"
5,Great skillet for cooks,"This is a very good skillet. It retains heat well, cooks with little or no oil and is a breeze to clean."
3,"Cooks Well, But Handle Can Burn You","This is a good small fry pan with a significant flaw. The heatproof part of the handle is somewhat short, and the metal part that connects it to the pan (and DOES get hot) is somewhat long. If you have long fingers or fingers that are difficult to bend because of arthritis, as I do, it is all too easy to inadvertently touch the hot part of the handle. I used this pan for quite some time with good results, but for my next one I'm going to try the T-Fal Ultimate, which has a longer curved heatproof handle that eliminates the problem."
3,Not so happy!,"Very heavy and well made. Nothing sticks to it. Easy to clean.UPDATE:I loved this skillet so much and it cooked evenly. But the coating came off after 2 yrs of limited use on medium heat. Had I known, I would have got a cheaper pan."
5,Ms. Freda Chao Madden,"This skillet is perfect for a large omlett which you can put anything you like. I love it. I hope it will last longer than my last one which was as heavy as this one, but only lasted three years."
5,Perfect little non stick pan,"Great construction, great coating. My wife said it is the perfect fried egg pan, she said she has yet to burn something in it."
5,Best Non-stick I've ever owned,"It's a bit heavy, which I actually like in comparison to my cheaply made lighter pans. After about a week of daily use, this is absolutely my favorite pan. Heats up quickly, totally non-stick, so much that you don't even need half as much oil or butter as usual, nothing burns on, and it cleans up easily. The soft grip handle is comfortable, a nice plus. Would definitely recommend."
5,A surprisingly nice pan,"I've gotten spoiled by >$200 Demeyere stainless/copper cookware, but needed a non-stick pan for eggs. From everything I've read, non-stick pans all eventually scratch, flake, or otherwise wear out, so it's not worth buying a $200 lifetime pan in non-stick. For the money, this is an excellent pan -- I'd compare it against anything else. The handle is firmly attached, comfortable, and stays cool, while the non-stick surface is smooth and non-stick.The one thing I miss about Demeyere vs. this pan is the rivets vs. welded attachment of the handle. Especially for non-stick, having an entirely non-stick interior with no odd shapes would make the pan even better. I'm not sure why other pan vendors don't weld their handles on -- it takes a little bit more work, but it makes the pan a lot more functional and easier to maintain."
3,It was great until the nonstick surface failed,"My wife used this skillet virtually everyday for the past 11 months. She loved how it cooked evenly. Its heft and padded handle were pluses.Sadly I had to order a replacement today. The nonstick surface has failed. Very disappointing - especially considering she treated it so carefully, never using metal utensils, etc.Going with Swiss Diamond Reinforced this time based on Consumer Reports recommendations."
4,Anolon Skillet,"Picked it as a gift. Originally was going to get the green fry pan, but the reviews indicated it would fail at high temperatures. This was a little more expensive but the cooking results are excellent and the anodized surface is truly nonstick. Would recommend to anyone."
5,"Anolon Advanced Hard Anodized 8"" skillet",The fry pan was really well. It doesn't stick and you hardly have to use any butter or oil. I works so well that I'm going to order the next size up to complete the set. I wanted to make sure it worked first before purchasing a larger size. I bought two other skillets that didn't work at all.
3,Great for a while...,"For the first few months this pan was excellent for our main usage: cooking eggs. Then slowly the non-stick faded and now we can't cook eggs in this pan without extensive sticking. So much for durability! Looks nice, but no better than cheaper non-sticks."
2,Unimpressed,"The pan is heavy and appears well made, but even cleaned per the directions it's never had stellar non-stick performance. Because of it's poor initial performance the first few times I used it, I haven't really used it enough to comment on durability. I don't find it to be a very handy size, either, but I can't really fault the pan for that one. Overall, I've had much better non-stick performance out of much less expensive pans."
5,Great Skillets,"I have bought all three now: 8in, 10in, and 12in and they are the best skillets I've ever had. Very heavy duty."
5,excellent. great pan,This is my go-to pan. Cooks great for one and cleans in a snap. After much research--this is the pan for me.
3,"unfinished edge, eggs stick","Bought this to replace my ""eggs only"" non stick skillet. This was a poor replacement. All of my current analon products are great, but this must be a ""second"". It doesn't have a lovely finished edge, as usual, and it actually sticks without oil. generally a spray works great with a non stick skillet, but not on this one. Would pass on this one."
5,great cookware,this is my 4th anolon advanced purchase. they are made to last. i am slowly replacing all my pans with these.
4,psi man review,"It was goodI was suprised by the theme, it was not what I expected.I was annoyed by the fact that the story kept switching time between past and present.However, the story itself was excellant, and was good enough to overlook the jumps in time.I have always enjoyed Peter David's books, and was looking forward to the next in the series.I was disappointed when I realised that there aren't any other books listed in the series.It is certainly worth reading and you will enjoy it."
3,younger readers,"seemed to be a little juvenilIe at first I though I had bought a ""young readers"" book. It did get more interesting as it went along."
3,Novel about Mennonites,"Coming from a family of Dutch Mennonites (my father's family) but knowing very little about their belief system because I was raised as a Roman Catholic by my Irish mother, I looked forward to learning more by reading this book. I learned some info.. Overall the book was OK."
3,"Amanda, a Daughter of the Mennonite",Since I haven't finished the book yet I can't give a full report but so far I am finding it very interesting. I love reading about the Amish faith and have Amish friends.
4,Good Book,"Even though this book was written in the old world style, I really enjoyed it. I like the way the character was able to overcome all of the obstacles that in her way (i.e. the old world style of thinking about women)."
2,Just okay,This book is just okay. It seems that there was a lot missed during the editing process. I am glad that it was a free kindle book because I would have been disappointed if I had paid for it. A simple story with a slow plot. A bit hard to keep your interest but I finished it. Will remove from my library as I wouldn't reread it.
3,Just a time filler for me.,Story seemed pretty lame. Didn't seem to have a lot of dimension to it. Would have liked more substance in the plot.
3,Amanda-a Daughter of the Mennonites.,Seemed to ramble on for quite a while in the beginning. Got better as it progressed. Last few chapters were good.
1,Amanda A daughter of the Mennonites,This book felt like I was reading a book written by a sixth grader. The portrayal of the characters seamed unrealistic and staged. It felt like the writer hadn't done any or very little interaction with the Mennonite community.
4,NICE,GOOD STORY LINE. SWEET ROMANCE. IT SHOWS CHRISTIANS ARE HUMAN AND NOT PERFECT AS SOME BELIEVE YOU HAVE TO BE TO BE CALLED A CHRISTIAN.
5,Sex Pistols live!,"Filth and the Fury is a great documentary from director Julian Temple on the Sex Pistol's.Film shows how the Pistol's became England's public enemy#1 in 1976 and 1977 by shaking up the status quo.They went against the grain and took no prisoners. The main speaker is Johnny Rotten,and he gives his version of the story,which sounds a lot better than their manager,Mclaren.Has a great interview with Sid in 1978,a year before his death,he seems quite lively and funny, and it's quite sad that he died at 21.Overall a great flick."
4,A thinking man's documentary on a band of hellions,"Julian Temple directed this tour-de-force documentary on seminal punks The Sex Pistols. Loaded with interviews and behind the scenes footage (some never seen before), you can see why a band that only released one album in their short career has become such an icon of modern music. Whether you care for the band or not, do not miss this one!"
5,great docu,"Great docu on the band. With great footage of England in the 70's. Great band footage and lot's of great interviews. I laso reviewed the book. It's pretty cool, but this dvd is awesome. Great insight into the whole time period of how bleak everything was. And how they came together to create something that no one realized would become the voice of the youth for a decade. Great film."
1,Ever get the feeling you've been cheated?,"After 20+ years you would've thought Temple could have made a film without rehashing swindle. 99% of the footage has been seen before, the only new stuff is the interviews carried out in pitch darkness - probably sounded good in theory, in reality it is profoundly dull.No complete performances, overdubbed music, endless footage of council flats, endless rehashed footage from Swindle. A complete and utter wasted opportunity.Ever get the feelin you've been cheated?"
4,a great documentary,"as a true sex pistols fan, i really enjoyed that movie when i first saw it at the movies. But, there there is one thing that could've make it better. All the songs are pasted on the performances from Nevermind the Bollocks except a few ones. The original sound must've been in really bad shape if Temple had to do that. But frankly, that's all that's negative about it, the rest is very good and any sex pistols fan with self-esteem must see this, trust me."
3,disapointment,"I found this DVD very disapointing i love the sex pistols but this DVD didnt do as good of a job showing them as i hoped for. Ive read ""i was a teenaged sex pistols"", ""the sex pistols and america 12 days on the road"", and ""ROTTEN no blacks no dogs no irish"" and i have to say this is not near as good as any of those were. There is to much focus on the late pistols and sid vicios and not enough on the glory days"
4,The Filth And The Fury,"This is a great story of strange time for a band that changed a lot of things in rock&roll. This is the story in their own words with some great footage before everyone had video cameras and the internet. If you liked the Pistols and want a raw story and the history of the band, this is THE one to have."
3,Filthy and Furious,"The Sex Pistols were an incendiary band that burned out in a flash, but their impact is still felt today. Their history is presented here through interviews and archival footage, and the documentary is fittingly dirty and gritty considering its subject matter. In addition to the story, there are several almost complete songs performed live in various venues. This is a must watch for fans, as well as anyone else interested in one of the most influential and infamous bands of the punk movement."
1,BOLLOCKS!!!!!!,"The Pistols made Punk into the biggest media bonanza since hippie.When Punk came out, to spread out its dirty little wings, the generation caught by the narcotic f**k up of the sixties had a new hope something to fight for, to live, but within months the dream was sold, baught out it was turned into another commodity beacause of bands like The Pistols,The Damned, and the Clash. They can stuff their punk credentials, with all their money up their a**. ANARCHY IN THE UK WHAT A BUNCH OF BOLLOCKS, what did they ever do to live out that dream.They didnt care about punk, they dont wanna worry about anything. They numb their minds on T.V., space out on coke and dope they dont want their sh*tty lives to surface. I know its sh*t and u know its sh*t but they wont admit to the themselves that the fun they have all that style they got is the same old sh*t. Their music is a joke. Find some other ""Punk"" bands theirs many and a lot better too. THE PISTOLS, BOLLOCKS!!!"
2,Excessive exclusions of important potential entries renders this reference of little value.,"Obviously in a field as large as mystery writing some limits had to be established to produce this relatively small book, somewhat longer than 200 pages. However, in this case the limits are so restrictive as to make this book of relatively little value to the mystery enthusiast.The book is organized alphabetically, with a section for each letter of the alphabet and an index. However, there is no section for X, and the sections for Y and Z are only a half-page each. The entries present are well written, but there are simply too few entries. For example, although the book's title is ""Whodunit?: A Who's Who in Crime and Mystery Writing"" by my count there are only three authors listed under A and seven under T.Because of the excessive pruning of significant and even important potential entries, this is not a book than can be recommend as a reference."
3,Play it till the top comes off!,This is a very good power pop CD from the rhythm section of the Posies with additional members on vocals and guitar. A one off CD collaboration.It gets better with each listen. It won't change your life but it will make your day.
2,Where's the finish!,"I enjoy Hillerman. I like the weaving of cultural information into fine mysteries. But what was he thinking with Hunting Badger? That no one would notice that he shipped the book to his publisher without completing it? It was the most frustrating Hillerman book I've read. HE NEVER FINISHED THE BOOK. ALL KINDS OF STORY LINES ARE LEFT HANGING. The writing style is classic Hillerman, and wonderfully entertaining, but you expect a story to have an ending! It was interesting that in the promo for his memoir (the publisher should have used the pages completing the story), he refers to a book he wrote that had an inadequate ending. He quotes the publisher telling him ""we want to publish it if you can write a better last chapter."" In Hunting Badger, Hillerman should have had as good a publisher."
3,Not Hillerman's Best,"I am a huge fan of Tony Hillerman's novels, and this one isn't up to par. It lacks the depth and evocative descriptions of Navajo belief, lore and countryside of some of his other novels. The story is rushed and spends way too much time referring to an older manhunt. Chee and Leaphorn are always a pleasure to visit, but if you're looking for Hillerman at his best, try ""Coyote Waits,"" ""People of Darkness,"" or any of the others."
4,Almost Worth Waiting For......,"Having read all of the Leaphorn and Chee stories, I eagerly awaited this one. It is not as good a read as other Leaphorn and/or Chee books but I enjoyed it all the same. I strongly recommend that anyone planning to read this book as their first adventure into solving a mystery the Navaho way, start with one or more of the earlier books in this series. I do enjoy the way this author describes landscapes, people, Native American traditions, and Indian folklore to solve crimes. I have never been to Navaho country but somehow (thanks to the author) it seems very familiar."
4,Relationships matter,"If we were reading Tony Hillerman for the plots, we wouldn't be sitting here talking. What is great about this book is the maturing relationships of Chee and Leaphorn, their growing ability to be comfortable about themselves, and the possible, successful resolution of their romantic relationships. In other words, we can be grateful that old friends have survived their respective losses and can look ahead. If you like Navajo country, you'll like this, and if you have read all the other books, this is not to be missed."
4,"Old Robbery, Tribal Policeman Dead","Tony Hillerman's HUNTIN BADGER has Joe Leaphorn and Jim Chee investigating an old robbery that resulted in the death of a tribal policeman. The FBI screwed up and a murderer escaped into the desert and mountains leaving a question of why did one of the robbers kill himself?Chee called in from a vacation discover a gap in the theory of the FBI investigation and Leaphorn joins him at the request of an old friend.Excellent plot with plenty of twists like the fantastic canyons of the Southwest.Nash Black, author of HAINTS."
3,"good story, damaged tape","Great story, well read but tape had some damage. Tape was sold as in very good condition but it was not.Most of it was fine but it was distorted in several places. I gave the tape to friends and told them to expect some distortion - they will be happy but I did not represent it as better than it is."
4,Very Happy,Bought the book to replace a library book my dog destroyed. It was exactly as ordered and came in good time.
4,Another Great Hillerman Novel,"As always, I enjoy reading Tony Hillerman's novels. I read and re-read them (both in print and as audio books). I was glad to see in this book that Jim Chee is getting over Janet Pete and starting to take notice of Officer Bernadette Manuelito. Chee and the retired Leaphorn solve the mystery long before the FBI guys which, of course, is pleasing. And then at the end of the book one of the robbers gets away. Now I need to be sure and read the next book in the series. This book is a good combination of Navajo culture, interesting characters, and suspense."
1,Time to Revitalize,"I think I have read everything Hillerman has written. Hunting Badger, is, at least in my opinion, his worst work. We already know Chee, Leaphorn and the other staple characters. Very disappointingly, Hunting Badger has no character development of the antagonists, no suspenseful plot and no real conclusion. This book seems to me to be a ""My editors want another book."" piece. I look forward to additional Hillerman books with hope that he will again do his usual interesting charatcer development as well as geographically detailed work. But, as far as Hunting Badger goes, miss it. It isn't very good. jbd"
5,Hunting Badger Scores High,"Tony Hillerman scores again with his riveting tale of greed and pursuit in the American West. His descriptions of the landscape of the Navajo reservation are just masterful. The characters are well developed and the story is beautifully crafted as usual. If you haven't read any of the Joe Leaphorn/Jim Chee stories this is a good one to introduce you to the world of the Navajo. Hillerman is a great story teller and ""Hunting Badger"" will keep you turning pages until the end."
4,Another Hit From Hillerman,"Tony Hillerman has written another engaging Chee/Leaphorn mystery, and although it's not my favorite work of the series, Hunting Badger is an excellent read. As far as contemporary mystery writing is concerned Hillerman is one of the best. The continuing evolution of his main characters is as interesting as the plot. With each book we get to know new sides of Jim Chee and the Legendary Lieutenant Leaphorn who had always been somewhat aloof until his wife's death and his retirement. It's nice to see him tread new ground after all these years. As always Hillerman is extremely adept at evoking the beautiful landscape of the Four Corners region, which regular readers have come to know and love. Within the mystery genre you're not likely to find a better sustained series, and Hunting Badger, if not the best in the series, nicely continues the tradition."
3,"Pretty Good Story, Atrocious Proofreading/Editing","I have read all of Hillerman's novels set in the Four Corners area. Must concur with other reviewers that (a) this story wasn't particularly strong, but (b) it was quite enjoyable, esp. if the reader already knows the characters. In most of Tony's other books, the villain and the weather play more of a role, so I was disappointed by the lack of importance given to them this time.But the proofreading & editing of this book were Godawful. I would strongly suggest that serious readers avoid first editions of ANYTHING from HarperCollins. They left it all to the spell-checker, which can't be trusted to replace ""censor"" with the intended ""sensor,"" or to correct punctuation typos. Next time I'm waiting for paperback; hopefully it will be less buggy."
2,Not one of Hillerman's best efforts,The characters are familiar to Hillerman fans and the plot and story are good enough for a decent read. But publishing houses obviously do not proof read books any longer. There are numerous typos that distract the reader.
2,hunting badger,A major disappointment for Hillerman fans. The type is large and the page format designed to make little appear to be a lot - it DOESN'T! Tony should be embarrassed to offer a minor effort like this to his long term fans.
2,lacks vitality,I have read all of Hillerman's work and this was one of his weakest. It did seem like he was just going through the motions. It was particularly weak on the Navajo culture that is usually fascinating and the reason I read him.
3,Rather juvenile,"It's not a bad book and there are some interesting twists in the plot but it's written at a pretty low level. If Hillerman had put a little more time into it, he could have spruced it up into a great book."
2,hillerman befogged,i am a long time fan of tony hillerman but this one has tested my loyalty. no question that it was abysmally edited but has anyone stopped to puzzle out where the villain at the end managed to get his truck loaded with the missing money since he's hardly had time to arrive and shoot up his partners. hillerman must have been working on a bad batch of peyote. harper collins should be ashamed of themselves
1,Hunting for a reason to like this book.,"Tony Hillerman is a great American author. His Jim Chee / Joe Leaphorn mysteries have introduced me to the Navajo culture and the American southwest, about which I knew little before I began to read his books. Therefore, I was very disappointed to discover that Hillerman's most recent book, ""Hunting Badger"", is far below his usual standards. I read the book before coming to this site, and I agree with the many criticisms posted by other reviewers. What I would like to add is my concern that two or more reviewers stated that ""Hunting Badger"" is the first Hillerman book they have read and it will be the last. They don't know what they're missing! ""Hunting Badger"" is in need of better editing, plot strengthening, more character development... and an ending!"
4,Dinetah,"This is another typical Hillerman, with his signature plots and style.I find books like HB one of the best way to understand the Southwest, canyonlands between Bluff, Blanding, Shiprock and Flagstaff. Its people, from rugged ranchers, to acculturated Navajos & Hopis and the 'traditionals'. And the interesting and often exhilarating competitive cooperation between various law enforcement agencies, including Tribal Police, BIA agents, FBI, State Police, INS agents, Border Patrol etc.before he died, Jim Chee's spiritual father, taught him one last lesson to become a hataalii singer. ""When you heal people who are out of harmony, who see no beauty anywhere... you tell them that the Power that made us made all this above us and around us and we are part of this Power and if we do as we are taught we can bring ourselves back into harmony. To cure them you must make them believe. You must believe so strongly that they feel it. ""Can't miss with this book."
2,unfinished,"Tony Hillerman is my favorite author. I re-read his earlier books while waiting for the next in the series to arrive. I visited Navajo Country just to be near the land and people he brings so completely to life. Hunting Badger made me fear that there will soon be no additions to the stories of Jim Chee and Joe Leaphorn. Much of the plot seems calculated to tie up loose ends, to settle story lines. I read that Mr. Hillerman has been ill, and that he recently lost a beloved brother. I hope he isn't contemplating retirement. Please, Mr. Hillerman, send Jim and Joe to us again soon."
1,A misstep in the series,"I've been a fan of the Hillerman series for many years, but Hunting Badger represents a great disappointment. I only hope that most new readers begin with another book in the series--any other would do. Also, why name a book after the villain if you're not going to confront or even glimpse him in the book? I felt as though Hillerman simply got tired and quit before he wrote the final chapters. Lots of typos and poor editing throughout. Maybe he had a falling-out with the publisher."
3,OK..not good....but OK,"[..]i have a very different opinion the adults. this is the third hillerman ive read and i was really exited to read this one. I WAS DISAPOINTED!!!! There is not much action as usual(not thats theres always much),its all driving and talkingThis book starts where 3 bandits rob a ute casino,kill a cop and fly away in a plane. Jim chee teams up with joe leaphorn and they work together to find these men.One ends up killing himself,the second is a ruthless killer and the last man they actually find.The problem is that the FBI keeps trying to stop the two from solvin the crime.The worst part of this book is that theres no climax. They kind of catch the badguys then it ends!!!!! I was very disapointed! Tony hillerman usually writes good interesting books but this was not his usual way of writing these books."
3,"So, So","I keep reading these because I like the characters and the location. However, I have yet to find one that has a plot that isn't superficial. They lack depth somehow. But, I keep hoping and reading."
2,As The Sun Slowly Sinks Into the West . . .,"I think it may be time for Mr. Hillerman to end this series of novels. I've read them all, but the most recent books, including this one, just don't measure up to the earlier stories. Leaphorn and Chee (and the FBI) are becoming caricatures. I think this series has run its course."
4,Classic Hillerman: Refreshing Return to 4 Corners,"Classic Hillerman, with a little growth on the part of Jim Chee and Joe Leaphorn. Loved returning to the high mesas and open spaces, visiting with these ""old friends"" and drawing myself into the magical landscape and native personalities Hillerman paints so well. Blessed with humor and clever insight, and yes, a little social commentary, our heros methodically solve the mystery that isn't quite as it first appears. And, yes, unfortunately this book should have been proofread."
4,A welcome visit with old friends,"The only trouble with Tony Hillerman's Leaphorn/Chee series is that a new one only appears every two years or so and they only last a few hours. I have to read them in one sitting, and then...it's over. The chance to visit, to watch them solve a mystery, is over all too quickly.Disappointing? No. This book delivers everything I want and expect from it. It entertains, it intrigues, it made time flash by. I picked it up and started reading and the next time I looked up it was 2am and I'd reached the end. Can't ask for more than that."
3,Not Great ... But Still Fun,"I have been a fan for quite a while. This book, while not on par with the Thief of Time or Ghostway, is still enjoyable -- mostly due to Chee and Leaphorn. These are two well-developed characters ... old friends I like to check in on from time to time.I found the overall plot to be promising, but at times, the story seemed rushed and not thoroughly explored. I was disappointed by the ending. Starting with Leaphorn's sudden unraveling of the mystery, the end was too rushed and a bit non-eventful.For those who like Hillerman, this is a must read. For those that are new to his work, check the Thief of Time. Read this one later after getting to know the characters."
5,This book makes you think it out!,I hated for the book to end. It left waiting impatiently for the next one.
1,Hunting Badger,"This is my first Hillerman book, and it will also be my last. I put it down after enduring 125 pages. I am not sure what the problem was, but it never really grabbed hold of me. The book seemed to just meander along without any real bite."
3,????? I was confused throughout......,"After reading this book, which I received as a ""freebie"" from a book club, I went to see the amazon.com ratings. Seeing the high ratings prompted me to rate a 3 instead of the 1 or 2 stars I considered.It appears Mr. Hillerman has written numerous other books with some of the same characters. Other authors do this and you can pretty much jump right in. In the case of ""Hunting Badger"" I was left clueless regarding some of the characters.Whatever happened to Cowboy Dashee? Jim Chee? Bernie? Primm? Was anyone brought to justice? What about Bai? That was a weird twist for him. Maybe I should have given it a 2 star rating.I loved the story setting and found Mr. Hillerman's writing gave me vivid mental pictures of areas totally foreign to me. I enjoyed his ""painting"" of the setting. Still, I wish he could have clued me in on what went on before this book."
3,Steelers Jersey,"The black on the numbers is weak. Not really black but sort of a transparent dark gray. Looks cheap. If I had seen it on a rack in a store, I would have passed it by."
2,a great disappointment,The plug into the GPS 276c will not stay connected with the gps on a table or upright on the boat; where I planned on using the etrac. Both the a/c adapter and the car charger have the same attachment plug; I returned both to Amazon when I returned from Central America.
2,"Not great, but I'll work with it.","I'm hoping this tastes better over time. There is definitely a metallic aftertaste. It is strong. Like ""maybe I just ingested something I shouldn't have"" strong. The effect is lessened when combined with other spices. I used a no salt blend (Kirkland brand) and added Nu Salt to give the blend a little more salty flavor. It worked OK, but not as tasty as I had hoped. I'll likely try out other similar products. If they all taste like this, then I'll just use it sparingly with heavy doses of other spices. It is definitely worth it to try to find tasty lower sodium options. Salt kills."
1,CONSULT YOUR DOCTOR BEFORE USING,This product was used in our hospital and had to be pulled.If you have poor renal clearance or suseptable to retaining Potassium you could have heart failure and die. I have seen this almost take 1 persons life before it was realized it was the Nu-Salt.
3,Nu-Salt,I had never tried this product before. It tastes a little different but not unpleasant and a little goes a long way!
2,Some good some bad,"Great to replace for cooking and sprinkling for those with hypertension (high blood pressure) since it has no sodium, but the taste/aftertaste will not be well received by all. Worth a try though."
5,Nu-salt,This salt doesn't have any sodium chloride in it and something else in it that gives it a little tingle on the tongue.
1,Beware if you're sensitive to MSG,"I bought this at the health food store, and I guess I could get used to the bitter aftertaste that, as one other reviewer says, ends up in your throat, but I should have read the ingredients more closely. Even if I liked the taste, I couldn't use it because of that last ingredient ""natural flavor"". Not sure if you're aware, but that's one of the many aliases of Mono-sodium Glutamate, as in ""Accent"", and is a flavor enhancer. Many people have no known sensitivities to MSG, but I'm a lifelong migraine sufferer and have to keep an eye out for it because it's poison to my system."
1,This stuff is absolutely NASTY!!,"I have no idea who is submitting the 5* reviews here, but they lost their taste buds years ago.This stuff tastes nothing like salt. It has a horrible bitter after-taste that lingers in your mouth ruining anything it touches.Try it at a restaurant or something before buying it. It even nauseates in cooking or in recipes requiring any significant amount of salt.If you are on a salt free diet, find something else. Yuk! With a capital Yuk!!=============UPDATE=====================I have found one use for this. In cooking, with tomato sauce, if you mix it with real salt, you need much less salt. The tomato sauce appears to nullify the bitterness somehow. So, if you like pasta with sauce but have to cut down on salt intake, perhaps this is the answer for that.But it is NO salt shaker for the table."
1,WARNING!!,"You should not use potassium chloride if you have kidney failure, Addison's disease, severe burns or other tissue injury, if you are dehydrated, if you take certain diuretics (water pills), or if you have high levels of potassium in your blood (hyperkalemia). Potassium chloride may be harmful to an unborn baby. Tell your doctor if you are pregnant or plan to become pregnant. Serious side effects of potassium include uneven heartbeat, muscle weakness or limp feeling, severe stomach pain, and numbness or tingling in your hands, feet, or mouth.In addition to all this scary information...product tastes horrible. Like something that is not intended for human consumption. Its bitter with a definate 'bite' and aftertaste. I would not expect anyone to use this product regardless of their health...it's that bad!"
4,Eddie still rocks,"I have seen Eddie Money nine times live in concert. Four of those times in the last year and a half. This disc represents exactly where Eddie Money is in his life. This is not his best work, but shows how good he still really is. He has definately aged, but still knows how to rock with the best of them.(The DVD of this show is just as good!) From the opening guitar riffs of Two Tickets to Paradise, to the ending notes of (Wanna Be a) Rock and Roll Star, he can really sing his ... off. Eddie has a remarkable back-up band with him, bringing some re-newed life into some of his songs. I would definately add this disc to your collection! Since his sales have been down, one only knows how many more Eddie Money releases we will be blessed to receive from this awesome entertainer. Also look into his catalog of other releases. He and his band are "" still "" putting out some great material, even though you do not here them on our radios.ENJOY...it's worth it!!!"
3,A B-movie epic worth seeing.,"Director William Cameron Menzies, set designer for ""Gone with the Wind"" and the original ""Invaders from Mars"" (1953, which he also directed), keeps this modest Civil War story moving along nicely and with sufficient human-interest details. Guy Madison (TV's ""Wild Bill Hickock"") and James Craig are close friends who end up on the North and South sides, respectively, and who, not surprisingly, must fight one another in the movie's final reels, though they do so out of sight to one another. Come to think of it, we only see them together some two or three minutes at the start of this reasonably exciting B-epic that belies its budget, courtesy of Menzie's set designs, in spite of harsh early-fifties color and a less than liberal budget. Nothing profound, but this notable picture does convey some of the tragedy of friends and loved ones torn apart by the most horribly personal war in our history."
2,Drums in the South,I was not happy with this movies. It was nott very well written. Long and seemed like it took forever.
1,no Rod Stewarts here,"Cibo Matto are one of the many bands trying to be too many things at once while winking to their friends in the audience. Stereotype A is an appropriation of many disparate styles, and it never comes together. The one lead singer in the band is very attractive, which makes their shows a must. Nothing on Stereotype A suggests that Cibo Matto will ever be able to incorporate many styles into one seamless blend like a music maestro such as Rod Stewart, whose many great albums are on sale right here at amazon, the country's most reliable source for music and book purchases. I think Yuko is the name of the very attractive member of Cibo Matto."
2,Cibo - Oh no!,"I'm a big fan of Cibo Matto's ""Viva La Woman!"" and was really looking forward to this new cd.. But here it is almost a year later and I still can't listen to it clear through. Fans of their earlier work should stay away, or at least be ready to be disappointed. Songs like ""Working For Vacation"" and ""King Of Silence"" are very catchy, and worth the price of the cd. The focus no longer seems to be on beautiful, bizarre, and haunting vocals, but on the electric and synthesizer heavy background trash. I hope their next one is better."
4,wok and roll!,"this album is equal parts bizarre and beautiful. this is wacky pop music at its best, with so many hairpin turns that youre dizzy at the end of it all. if youre a fan of brazilian heavy metal jazz hip hop, then pick it up. if not, loosen up and buy this album anyway."
5,Great Album for new aged music lovers!,"I bought this CD 1) because I love Cibo Matto 2) Because I am a new aged music listener my self, and 3)Cibo Matto`s lyrics dont have to be understandable to say what is said. The beats and techno style music I think is going to be the music people in the future are going to be listening to the most. NOT COUNTRY!"
3,"I loved this, but you might not",As the name suggested there are funky Japanese musicians at work here. This strange mix of pop and rock is perhaps more interestnig than it is good. The lyrics are very original if not a little nonsensical. It's worth having a listen to the tracks before buying. You'll either like it or hate it. I wouldn't part with my copy.
3,fun but a little bland,"this album is enjoyable...the lyrics are fun, and i particularly like ""sci-fi wasabi"" and ""speechless""...but overall it lacks energy. i feel as though the group spread itself thin trying to include a little of everything. cibo matto is not the only band doing the mixing/beats thing, and i think other groups do it better."
2,Where is the quirky fun?,This was okay but I already own Pizacatto Five and Stereolab. I miss the innovative loops and samples - like from the first album.
1,Cibo Matto Goes Mainstream R&B,"What a disappointing, overproduced, overhyped mess. Yes, the ladies have abandoned their former trip-pop, sampled, quirky kookiness for radio friendly, very mainstream r&b blandness, replete with empty romanticized lyrics (I really miss the food references) and annoying (Shades of a Carpenters revival) backing vocals. There are only two vaguely salvagable tracks here ""Sci-Fi Wasabi"" (Derailed for me by an uncool Star Wars reference) and ""Blue Train"" (Sounds like a bad Buffalo Daughter outtake). The rest is an indistinguishable blip on the Top 50 charts. And why did they tamper with ""Spoon"", which was perfectly fine in its former incarnation (Perhaps to show off their improved diction)???? They're sure to make lots of money (Probably the idea)with this as the new Japanese TLC."
1,Cibo Matto has made an incredibly boring album,"Having heard the decent track by Cibo Matto ""Sci-fi Wasabi"" on a CMJ sampler, I bought STEREOTYPE A thinking it might have other songs in the same vein. Much to my dismay, it honestly is a boring album. Nearly the songs sound the same, and the singing of Miho Hatori and Yuka Honda is inept and lazy.Cibo Matto, like several other Japanese artists (most notably Towa Tei), tried to use the American fascination with seemingly alien culture to sell this album. In the end, all one gets is a collection of 14 yawn-inducing filler-pop tracks. It has no redeeming qualities, and I would recommend that people would find much more worthy music to spend their money on."
3,"Stereo type ""Ugh""","this band has always confounded me a bit. they seem to be good musicians and Yuka Honda apparently is a big name around the new york scene, but these Cibo Matto records just do not hold up over time. one of their biggest pitfalls is that they can't decide if they want to be serious or just take the piss and be silly. sure, it's cool to do both, but when you've got an absolutely stunningly great song on here like ""Stone"" on the same album with the cringeworthy ""Lint of Love""...it's just not right. something's gotta give. are you a pop band or a novelty act? it's frustrating, because their are some real moments of great pop genius here ( ""Moonchild"", ""Sunday Part II"") and then horrifying mistakes ( ""Sci-fi Wasabi"", ""Blue Train""). well...take it how you want it, i guess. it could have been so much more. this band has been gone for some time now, but we'll always have ""Know Your Chicken."" heehee"
4,"eh, so so. Not as good as the 1st.","it is still very good,but it is not as fun to litsin to as the 1st cd was.It sounds like they are haveing more fun with abigger band though."
3,"Solid album, but more loungey and boring than Viva La Woman","Don't be misled by the other review on here that says this is ""mainstream R&B"", and that the album is somehow consciously ""commercial."" Ridiculous. However, I can understand the dissatisfied position that that reviewer was coming from. On first listen (which is all I have to go on) Stereotype A seems less exciting or creative than the first album. It sounds like the girls in Cibo Matto really enjoy playing with a full band, but the results just aren't as remarkable as the more eclectic, sampler-driven stuff on their first album. Practically every song has a laid-back lounge vibe, reminiscent of Beck songs like New Pollution, and beautiful singing -- which might grow on me, but my first impression of this album is that it's well-crafted and ""mature,"" but sadly, this seems to equal boring."
5,I Can't Stop Listening to It,"I had never heard of Cibo Matto, but I read a review of Stereotype A in the LA Times which seemed to indicate it would appeal to me. So I listened to some sound samples and then took a flyer and bought the album.All I can say is I am absolutely under this album's spell. I cannot get over how good and interesting and moving and funky it is. It is fantastic and has rarely been out of my car's CD player. When friend's hear it they all say ""This is great. Who is it?""...""Cibo who?"" Best Album of 1999 in my opinion"
3,"Not bad, but not excellent either","This is my first listen to Cibo Matto. I think this album is okay, but it did not strike me as anything too special. I'm a big Pizzicato Five fan and I also like Cornelius' Fantasma. The Cibo Matto vocals are easier to understand than Kahimi Karie, and it helps that they are printed. But the lyrics didn't grab me and neither did the beats. Some tracks had promising openings but didn't seem to go anywhere. I dunno -- I'll give this disc another listen and try to figure out what these Japanese girls are talking about."
3,"Not bad, no Viva la Woman...","This is a definite headphones CD. Although very diverse, I didn't feel the intense groove or sultriness of Viva la Woman. A good CD from a confident band is always welcome, but I expected more from this one."
4,"Cibo Matto fans, grab this one up fast..","Having been drawn into Cibo Matto's music several years ago by a friend who referred to them as 'goddesses, pure and simple', I was quick to buy my own copy of ""Viva! La Woman!"" and adored the food anthems found on that album.. When Stereo*Type A was released, I saved up my pennies and grabbed a copy of this one, too.If you weren't sure you liked Viva! La Woman, chances are you'll find this album more reassuring. While VLW took some getting used to (for me, at least), Stereo*Type A was a much smoother effort. Songs like Working for Vacation, Sci-Fi Wasabi, and Clouds became my new favorite tracks instantly and suffered long hours of 'repeat' mode on my CD player.This one's a keeper, folks. Go buy your own copy and see for yourself. ^_-"
3,"Important writer, but never quite reaches mastery","I am writing a final paper on this book at the moment. Chestnutt is an important writer, but not one of the best of the period. I don't think he ever got the chance to fully mature as a writer. This book leaves me with a lot of what-ifs and whys. For example, he introduces a nephew to the heroine who appears as though he will be important, but simply drops out of the picture. The book leaves me wondering what he meant to do, and didn't have time for. It is a good read, but rather frustrating.If you only have time to read one African American classic, I would turn you instead to Zora Neale Hurston's ""Their Eyes Are Watching God"" which is truly amazing!"
4,"A good buy, no doubt about that","As usual box sets are always pleasing, especially when there are many special features (like this set), but If you are a ""die hard"" fan of Mission impossible 1 and 2 I wouldn't buy this. Tom Cruise and David fincher are in talks to make a third (Tom Cruise want's a different director for each film). If you are truly a fan wait for the collectors edition of the trilogy."
2,WHERE'S THE REMAKE???,"Enough already! This movie was a mess when it was released and it remains a mess. De Palma is a much better director then this so all I can imagne is that he was under considerable pressure from the studio to bring it in under a certain time limit. Please, movie gods, whereever you are, how about a director's cut so we can see what De Palma could really do with this."
2,Recycled And Then Some,"RE-CYCLED VINYL BLUES represents the first time I have ever been disapointed by any music Neil Innes has been associated with.Maybe I'm giving him too much credit, but I always thought Innes was an overlooked genius who could turn virtually anything into an interesting tune. This CD proves me wrong. The production is thick and muddy, the playing is slow and slovenly, and the lyrics are dull and lifeless.The only redeeming tracks here are ""Lie Down And Be Counted,"" an acoustic strummer with a sense of humor and some tasty backing vocals, and ""How Sweet To Be An Idiot,"" which fits in with some of the very best of Innes' catalog. Too much of the rest of the record sounds like Innes and some studio hacks trying to fulfill contractual obligations.Thank God for the Rutles."
2,DULLSVILLE,"MAXIMUM VELOCITY's script is so shoddily written and so many plot devices unexplained, one has to wonder what in the world it was made for. Seems like perennial bad guy Michael Ironside and the US AIR FORCE have developed a Storm Fury program that can generate devastating hurricanes, and has been designed as a weapon of destruction. However, when a black comet passes through the earth's atmosphere, it causes a superstorm with the potential to devastate the entire east coast. Now Ironside seems to be doing good when Storm Fury is reinstituted to destroy this storm. The script is so wishy washy and unfocused that what little tension or suspense is generated is wasted on the muddled governmental interference. Dale Midkiff (Pet Sematary) is wasted in his good guy role, and the rest of the cast merely does their shtick. A disappointingly dull movie."
3,"Where's the cars? This video not reccommended,","The reason I rated this movie as high as I did is because it did have some fine girls; as suggested by the title.However, I was also expecting to see some hot import cars. Did I see some? Not if you call pointing the camera at the car for 1 second. In most cases, they flashed the car so fast that it wasn't even enough time to hit the pause button on the remote.And when they did show a nice front view of a car, it was shot through a fishbowl lens or some dumb angle. Or, it was just the front fender, or the hood. What about the whole vehicle?Oh, they showed close-ups of the rims, the muffler, and the fan belt, but you would think that in a video about import cars, that the focus of the video would be ""IMPORT CARS""; not a s**tload of advertisements (although some are expected).What's sad is that the film editor had the opportunity to make a nice video as evidenced by all the fine cars in the distant background. More cheesy interviews than anything."
5,>_< This is dne of the best books in the world!!!!,"I fell in love with this book as soon as I read the 5th book, A darkest hour! I've been reading all the Warriors series ever since!!!! Please don't stop writing these excellent books@!!!"
4,starlight,I think starlight will be very good! I want to learn about the cats new home! and see if Erin changed it back to Fierstar! I hope she did. Even if she dident I still think that starlight will be very good! I even gave my self a name it is Treepaw my friends have names to they are Skypaw and Windpaw! I hope after this Erin will right a 5th book or iff she dosent I will die!
2,glitch,i love the warrior series but am really annoyed by the fact that there is a reacorring glitch in this book. some of the ends of sentances are replaced but text like this:(.arrowhoriez)as i said it got on my nerves and ment not all of the book made senseplease fix this so me and other readers can truly apperciate this book.
5,Just sample it.......please !,"I i‘m the biggest “hunger games“ fan ever, but i would have to say these book are almost better! You have showed me erin hunter “never judge a book by its cover “ so please just sample it."
2,bad book,i am in absoloute love with the series but this book was appalling. the best was when a tree fell on a cat! there is something to be said about that. thankfully i went on to read the rest of the series and the rest were amazing. but dont use this book to judge the rest of the series. the book is okay i mean u need it for the rest of the series.
5,warriors rule!,"I havnt yet read this book (and i cant wait to) but i read all the warriors books up to this one, and i enjoyed every one of them. Me and my friens even made up numerous names for ourselves and clans. i am Pinestar leader of ForestClan and Mintwhisper medicine cat of FroestClan. i love so many warriors characters such as Leafpaw, Sandstom, Sorreltail and more. buy this book and the entire rest of the series youll enjoy it!"
3,A good addition to the Warriors series,"On a scale of 1-5 I would give this book a 3 because, although it was a very good book, it lacked some of the action found in other books of the series. Although it was much better than the first book, it wasn't the best that I have read so far in this series.This book is about a group of cats that live in the forest in clans but have been forced to leave their home by humans who were building a road (the cats call roads ""thunderpaths"") through their territory. In this book the author tells about how the cats are struggling to set up new boundaries and settle into their new home as well as trying to forget the new friendships the cats have made with other clans on the long journey to their new home (the clan cats don't usually make friends with other clans).I think you should definitely read this book because, although it lacks a lot of action, it is an interesting read and helps the other books in the series make more sense if you are planning to read them."
5,Txighovohckhvkhvkhvihi,It was really good I think people will like this book bchchffbbfhfh Chubb church. Changing funding. Find entrenched this finch fish disobedience
4,Erin Hunter Writes Again,"For those who have just finished Dawn, Starlight is next! When you are reading this book so many questions will pop up in your head. They will be answered, and soon the book will take many exciting turns. Problems will arise, and it's not always easy finding a solution. If you've read Dawn, then you only know part of the story. More of the story is held in this book. It will fill your mind with thoughts, and new ideas. You will look at each character differently in this book than you did in the past books. This book is a great entertainment! Children literally scream for more!"
2,Good Story - Bad Editing,"I've really enjoyed reading the book, but the frequent spelling/word errors are starting to distract from my experience. At one point, Hawkfrost says he's Thunderclan instead of Riverclan... ugh... and various other grammar mistakes. Plus, the characterizations are beginning to run together. Oh.. and don't even get me started on things being mentioned that are completely ignored as though they are never said for books and books. At first, I put it off as: It's a book for kids... but good grief, dragging them out as far as they have and having characters acting inappropriate from what they've been told as though it never happened,... characters who have in the past been known to pay attention and dwell on such things...ugh. I'm going to finish this set of books, then that's it."
2,Did not work for me,"I have a well, and this sprinkler did not work with it. The head did not rotate properly. Maybe not enough psi?"
2,only read this is if you really really like short stories,"I picked up this book after reading John Berdendt's book on Venice and Jane Turner Rylands' book paled in comparison. She captured some colorful characters in her book, the writing is lively, but that's all she does, captures the characters. I realize the short stories are short stories but these character snapshots feel incomplete - more like a bit of poetry."
2,Very pale picture of a colorful city.,"Where is the passion, the color and the life ? These bland stories paint a very pale picture of Venice - the city and people are never brought clearly to life. This book was a big disappointment for me."
4,"A beautiful, serene piece of art and space","Douglas Barry Butler has indeed found his niche and comes full circle with it. His ear for meditational sounds is proven in his work - and meditational it is! It is beautiful and constant in its serenity. A trip in a space stations with a window view, but unlike the norm in spacey music, romance is felt. A romantic and warm view of the outter limits. Mr. Butler's debut has startled my visions of the stars...Enya and Vangelis should be proud to have someone so closely to follow in their steps. Lush sweeps in his song Islands, and icey warm twinkles throughout the album. A definite good buy!"
5,Romantic minimalism at it's best!,"One of the calmest, yet vibrant collection of songs I have heard in years. The way it presents itself is at first almost unnoticeable - like a rain in the forest which plays itself out and crescendos like the force of a waterfall. Meditation music has never been so beautiful."
5,For Christians who like Classic Rock,"I'm a long time listener of Glass Harp and Phil Keaggy. I'm not a music critic, so this review will be simple. This is a good classic rock album for people who like the Beatles and Simon and Garfunkel. They're kind of mellow on this album. Phil Keaggy has some great guitar solos (made even more amazing by the fact that he has only 9 fingers)."
2,wendyr,"We purchased this because I wanted a whistling tea kettle. I am very disappointed because after only several months of occasional use, the whistle component has broken off and fallen out of the kettle. It can not be repaired.The look is sleek and the kettle opens automatically when you start to pour but this does not justify the cost, esp, when it does not last!! Find another kettle that costs less!"
1,Rust problems,This is a great kettle with one serious flaw. My kettle has started rusting inside the spout after 1 year. There is a lip where the spout joins the base and water is caught there after use.
2,Lid shattered second use,"The second time that we used this pan with the lid, the lid shattered. The pan itself is quite functional but having the lid shatter the second time of use merits the rather poor rating."
1,Lid shattered during first use,The glass lid shattered the first time we used the pan. I returned the lid to Anolon and was sent a replacement. Have not tested the new lid.
3,Pan is too heavy,This looks like a great pan but it is just too heavy. I returned it. I recommend the Circulon Elite match. I love mine.
5,THE definitive study of monastic life at the high tide of the Benedictine tradition.,"The most compelling feature of this relatively short book is its level of detail about monastic life at Cluny over two and a half centuries. I've read several books on the topic, and none match the granularity and scholarship of Evans' work. Why is this book out of print?"
5,Best of the Year! alittle bit of everything,"Llanas's sings with so much emotion, every song is believable"
5,Grammy winner - just needs promotion!,"Sam Llanas of Bodeans displays his immense songwriting talents - a personal album, but addicting, as the best music can be. Thanks, Sam & Absinthe boys (& girls), keep it up...."
1,I love the Bodeans but not Sammy's solo effort,"I have every Bodeans album ever made (my favorite is the live ""Joe Dirt Car""), I have seen them in front of 200 people as well as 15,000 people (at Milwaukee's Summerfest) and absolutely love them. I was anxious to listen to Sammy's solo effort but have to admit it is not a CD I listen to often. The theme of the album is extremely dark and the CD simply depresses me.I am eagerly awaiting Kurt Neuwmann's solo effort (coming July 25, 2000). As the other half of the Bodeans songwriting duo, his album will likely be much more upbeat musically but still have great words...we'll find out in a few weeks."
3,Sample questions and answers are right next to each other.,"Would it have been too difficult to segregate the questions and answers from each other? The answers are right next to each sample question, so you often end up looking at the answer before you've even had a chance to read the question! This is really annoying.However, the content is pretty good and clear. It makes for a decent way to review material you haven't touched in years. I just wish they had made it easier to not see the answers."
5,Sweet sword must buy,"i bought this same sword at the mall. it is a fine quality sword good balance, a fine piece."
5,Bronson's Final Bow,"Charles Bronson gives his final performance as Police Commissioner Paul Fein in this very good telefilm. It may not be the best movie, but Bronson gives it his best and goes out in style. Highly recommended for any Bronson fan."
2,Geiger Counter GCK-01 Kit,"This Geiger Counter GCK-01 Kit came from Images SI, Inc. with missing resisters and wrong diodes mislabeled. The instruction booklet is poorly written for a beginner. The company did not respond to my requests for the missing resistors. Unfortunately I soldered in the wrong mislabeled IN4007 1 KV diodes where the zenner diodes were supposed to go and consequently may have ruined the PCB. I do not recommend this kit unless you are expierenced in building circuit boards and are willing to buy the correct resistors and zener diodes locally. I ordered directly from the company and they were one month late in their promised delivery date."
4,No Guru. No Method. No Teacher.,"THE SPIRITUAL TOURIST: A PERSONAL ODYSSEY THROUGH THE OUTER REACHES OF BELIEF, is a personal chronicle of the author Mick Brown's spiritual peregrinations around the globe searching for...well, just plain searching. The author's search for far-flung spiritual gurus takes him from the peaks of the Himalayas to the foothills of the Appalachian Mountains and all points in between. Though Brown approaches his journey with the skeptical eye of a journalist and is forthright in his opinions, he never writes with condescension towards his subjects and allows the reader to make their own judgment about the spiritual validity of the various gurus encountered in his journey. As the title of the book indicates, Brown journeyed as an observer; I don't think he expected to find THE spiritual truth and I suppose in doing that, he indeed discovered a spiritual truth: truth will find you."
4,Everyones esential spirtual companion,"Ever wonderd who or what was at the centre of the universe? heard of gurus living gods and sweet mothers but never found anything compact enough or enjoyable enough to read ? Well then this is for you. A mystical, enlightening and down to earth account of one mans journey through the spiritual extasy and quagmire ,that is the east. you can almost smell the incence filled ashrams he descibes, giggle at the more excentric manifestations of the gods of the east and read in awe as the description of darhsan, with the lamas and sias he has met!"
2,Deeply disappointing; I expected a much better book.,"From the cover I thought this was going to be fairly entertaining, but it was mushy, tedious, and lacking in any serious thought. I found the array of characters Brown meets more pitiful than spiritual. Not worth the money."
3,A good basic introduction - but some problems,"David Libertone offers a readable introduction to MSCS but doesn't offer much more than the Microsoft manual. There are some errors and the (lack of) editing is not what I would expect from a professional reference manual. However, there are currently few Microsoft cluster books to choose from so this is probably the best introduction available."
3,The Anthem is a rocker son!!!!,"Ihaven't heard all of the tracks, but if you can scoop a single, get the anthem dun. This shit of the the meters yo!!!!"
5,first soundboming 2 now sway & tech,"99 seems to be the year of mix tapes first soundbombing two now this what next? this cd is phat from what ive heard. ive already heard the anthem, get you mad by Eminem, and Chino XL's joint and belive me ill be picking this one up."
5,Fresher than fresh!,"To all you gangsters out there! This is hip-hop in its purest form and this is how it should be. All this gun, money, Versace, and crystal talk in today's rap just plain wack. So, know your hip-hop and buy this dope mix tape! (ya heard') P.S. Watch out for those ""sucka emcees."""
2,Monsters of Death Row,it was okay but very monotonous. The author said the same thing over and over again just filled in different names each chapter
3,Thomas the tank engine goes racing!,"The stories are OK, but not great. I think these characters would make great cartoons, but there is something weird about them that I have not isolated yet - possibly a UK child psychology consultant with different views than me!?!.I am a native Californian, and I know that Linda Dennis is also from California, but she went way overboard with arcane UK English and slamming the other teams - there are a number of subtle F1 political jabs ala Rocky and Bullwinkle. Maybe this is what kids want, but we are not a Disney based family.These stories do not keep my 2 year old's interest so far, and even the pictures of the cars arguing and the cars stuck in goo made him say ""No like that ..."" and ""Car fall down ..."". These books will go on the shelf for a few years and we will readdress them then.For the time being, we'll return to normalcy with `Duck on a Bike', the `Runaway Ralph' series, `The Rainbow Fish' and Jay Jay the Jetplane videos."
5,Blew Me Away,"I am going to keep this review brief, but if you are on the fence about buying this stop thinking and do. It's one of the most poetic and musical film(s). Although the films are short they are dense and pack just as much of a punch than any full length film. Definitely worth it."
3,Not Pleased with the shock absorption,"Although the fit and rocking motion of the shoe is good, I am not pleased with the shock absorption factor. On the first day I ran in them, I could feel the shock in my upper quads and the start of a shin splint. I will replace the insoles with Footlocker Brand insoles to see if that helps with the shock absorption. If the new insoles don't help, I will use them ""around the house"" and find new ones to run in. Other than that, they are nice looking slate blue shoes."
4,TRUE TO SIZE - do not order 1/2 size bigger!,"I read a review someplace to order this shoe a 1/2 size bigger - don't! I did, and now I have to return them because they don't fit. Other than that, cool shoe... the upper is a bit stiff, but I think it would be a good gym shoe. Too bad they don't have my size anymore :("
5,Best Shoes EVER,"I have always had problems with shoes fitting. These have been the best shoes I have ever had. I have problems with my left foot after tearing all the ligaments, these have been a life saver."
5,Excellent shoe for the price,This shoe is cushiony and comfortable. Rooming toe box is a plus also.As good as Nike TL4 for less than half the price.
3,Not for me...,"Even though the shoe is pretty comfortable, all the cushion does not really make a difference when running. They are cool looking but for running they were not for me."
2,Pretty but not as good as Mega Bounce,"I bought this to replace a pair of Adidas Mega Bounce. This shoes do not have as much cushion and comfort as the Mega Bounce. I bought it because Amazon didn't have a pair of Mega Bounce on my size.It is ok for short distance walking but for long distance walking and running, I need more cushioning. I felt pain in my toes after a mile and I could use a bit more arch support."
5,This cd is raw!,"i just bought this cd, and i can alreayd tell that this cd is as good as his last. i just listened to track 17, that is the chillest SONG EVER! if you are a no limit fan this is a must have!"
5,GET THE ALBUM,"I DO NOT KNOW WHY YOU, MR. EAGAN,MN,IS DISSING FIEND AND HE'S NEW ALBUM IT IS GOING TO BE THE BOMB. AND SO WANT HE HAS TO MUCH SWEARING WHO DOES'NT. SO WATCH ""STREET LIFE"" IS GOING TO BE 2x PLATNIUM JUST WATCH, YOU'LL SEE."
1,very disappointing,"first of all, this cd has too much swearing. second, it's just boring to listen to...there arent any decent rythms. What was fiend thinking when he wrote this horrible cd??? go buy 2pac or jay-z if you want to listen to decent rap!"
3,Average NL CD,"Since most of No Limit's albums are slammin, this album was quite a disappointment. Don't get me wrong now, Fiend's hella tight. But I think this album could have been better and had more people on it. The best songs on here are The Rock Show, Ak'n Bad, and Mr. Whomp Whomp. Buy it. It's worth checking out"
4,Fiend shows why he's one of the more talented soldiers,"On his sophomore album, Fiend mixes things up a little, most notably including only four guest appearances, as opposed to the fifty or so on his last album. On ""Ak'n Bad,"" over a grimy beat, Mystikal steals the show with the fast paced stutter-stop flow he's mastered. ""Heart Of A Ghetto Boy"" is a subdued track on which Fiend slows his flow to match the sax in the background. The track is a welcome break from the rowdiness of the first six tracks. On ""Walk That Line,"" he totally flips his flow. You gotta listen to it more than once to fully appreciate it. Other standout tracks include ""The Rock Show,"" ""Trip To London,"" and ""Waiting On God.""The album could've done without songs like ""The Truth Is"" and ""They Don't Hear Me,"" as they don't bring anything new to the table. But overall, ""Street Life"" is one of the better No Limit releases of recent memory."
4,The best hip hop artist from the South.,"I actually don't even like no limit, the only artists I am down wit right now are Mystikal and Fiend and I just picked up the new joint ""Street Life"" and it was blazin. The self-titled intro sets up the whole album. The best cuts are ""The Rock Show"" ""Trip To London"" ""They Don't Hear Me"" and what may be the deepest and most constructed piece of hip hop ever is the last cut ""Waiting on God"" which actually got me thinking. This cat needs to leave no limit and start up his own cause he's got some skillz."
3,A solid fantasy,"Having read several of Ed Greenwood's books in the distant past I dubbed him somewhat uninteresting and forgot about him as a writer until now, when he published his first new non-FR novel. After acquainting myself further with The Kingless Land, I realized that despite Ed's best attempts to tear away from his old way of writing, he spent simply too much time exploring Faerun with TSR. His style of writing lacks deep meaning (at least in my opinion), and his unability to produce twists in his work is simply discouraging. The Kingless Land may be a solid fantasy novel with a tried-and-true plot, but if you've read much of the author's previous books, you will immediately see that this is merely his old FR theme in flimsy disguise."
2,Not my kind of book,"This book is full of action, adventure, and magic, so much that it seems as if it were lifted straight from a D&D campaign. Unfortunately, that doesn't make for a very good book in my opinion. The characters do ridiculous things, seeming at times like they were taken from a 14 year-old's hormone-driven fantasies. It is a fast read--you should be able to finish it in a weekend--and it certainly doesn't require much thought. If that is the kind of book you are looking for then by all means read it, I doubt you will be disappointed. However, there are other books out there that have those qualities (action, adventure, magic) but are much more interesting to read (anything written by David Eddings or Raymond Feist, for example). I gave it two stars because the book isn't unbearable to read, it's just not very interesting. Also, I don't think Mr. Greenwood was trying to write a masterpiece and I imagine it is popular among its target readers."
4,Band of 4 Beginning,"Despite being the weakest in the series, The Kingless Land starts off very fast paced and it has that feel like you're playing a D&D game. The characters are very likable and really grow on you. Would make a great movie IMO, better than Lord of the Rings. I recommend checking out the rest of the series as it just gets better and better."
2,Mindless dribble,I've read almost all of Ed Greenwoods works and I really have to say that this series wins the cake on the worst one yet. It starts out with promise but the further you get in the book the more it seems to insult your intelligence. The main characters mainly go through this one and the next two just fighting an endless host of people with swords and magic. Through pure luck they continually win and if they get beat someone comes along and saves them at the last minute. There is really no plot development and it gets way too mind numbing. I made the mistake of reading the next two out of boredom and kept hoping that something would happen. IT NEVER DID!!! Even if you love Ed Greenwood please avoid this series.
2,NOT THAT GREAT,"AS A HISTORY BUFF, I WAS DISSAPOINTED WITH THIS. IT'S CHEAPLY MADE AND NOT VERY IN DEPTH. LOOK FOR SOMETHING BETTER."
5,Babe review,This is a very endearing film. This is a movie any one of any age can enjoy. My toddler watches it and has learned alot about caring and kindheartedness. My 68 year old father in law watched it and loved it just as much! It's one of the few films you can feel good about seeing and can watch over and over again and enjoy it every time!
5,One of my favorite movies of all time.,"I'm a 22 year old guy, and I love this flick, it's great family fun, and Even I like it haha. It's got a ton of adorable animals and a pretty good story line. A must have if you have any kid under 13 years old, or just dorky kids like me!!"
5,"the movie is the best, and better than the new one!",the talking mice are hilarious!The pig thinks he's a sheep pig!The movie is the best of pig movies! The puppies are so cute!!!!!!!
3,DTS but no Widescreen?,"What the hell were they thinking? The DTS sounds fine, but not really neccesary with this title. Giving only the ""pan&scan"" version is a crime.5 Stars for the movie and DTS1 Star for the lack of features and no widescreen."
1,GREAT movie - TERRIBLE DVD,"This is by far one of my all time favorite movies. My wife always loved it, so has my 3-year old boy. So we went ahead and purchased this movie on DVD. However, how annoying is it when the DVD doesn't allow you to skip the previews of other insignificant movies before you actually get to see the feature film. This thing locks up your DVD player control completely (disables functions of menu / stop / fast forward) and forces you to sit through previews of five movies before ever getting to the Babe feature. It is simply the most offensive and intruding thing my family has ever experienced in DVD's and VHS.I have a lot of words to describe those folks at Universal Studio, I will try to be gentle. Let's just put it this way - your limited creativity in marketing really must be the ultimate lowest of all."
1,"Love the movie, not the previews...","First and foremost: Babe is one of my favorite movies.If you haven't seen it, you're missing out.But this movie has ""coming attractions"", previews that cannot be skipped. Granted, they're only a few minutes long. But you have to watch them each and every time you play the disk. No skipping to the title menu.If there were other versions available, I'd buy them.Hey studios: Ineffective marketing tool. Next time I'll research before I buy, and won't buy a movie with forced previews."
1,Buy the VHS Tape,"One of the benefits of DVDs is the ability to skip to any part of the movie easily. This benefit is exceptionally true when you have kids and they want to watch a movie. Normally, you can skip the trailers and head right to the movie or at least the main menu. This DVD makes you go through each of the many trailers before you can get to the main menu. You can't fast forward through them or skip them. You must wait until the trailers have completed then select ""Play"" from the main menu. Because of this, we would have rather bought the VHS version of the movie. With a tape, you can at least fast forward through the trailers!"
5,Pig of Destiny,"A fable celebrating the triumph of the improbable in the face of convention. Clever use of storybook titles, narrative, lighting & music make this a captivating experience. Ntl Soc Film Critics, Best Film. Golden Globe Best Film (music / comedy). 6 Academy Award nominations incl Best Director"
3,"Cute, but could have been so much better","Sorry to all who love this movie. It is cute and loveable and really quite good by kid-vid standards; and I know it's not fair to judge a film by the book its based on: but this could have been so much more inspiring and less silly. I thought this show was cartoon-like, but stylish, until I read the book to my daughter. Now I think it is stylish but cheap.Dear film makers: if you have to use cute singing mice, evil cats, dumb ducks, bad pig wigs and creepy moving animal lips, please pile them on a story that needs that kind of help. Leave Dick King-Smith and E. B. White alone, thank you. I just don't believe classic tales, especially modern classics, need to be puffed up with this kind of pop-pandering padding.On the positive side, This video is way better than the really, really dumb sequel."
3,The pig was a ham,"Journey with a pig's life on a farm, as it talks. Still not as annoying as ""Look Who's Talking (1989)"", but, not as good as Koneko monogatari (1986) [aka The Adventures of Milo and Otis (1989)].This movie is a bit boring, as talking animals who don't talk in real life, talk with sarcastic quips. Will the pig go on to another movie? Will the farmer win a prize for the pig? Should they have cut the dull parts out? I don't know, but, as a movie to watch mabye once every five years, this would be the movie for you."
3,This movie is something I can't quite put my finger on....,"I saw this movie presented in a high-school auditorium, it's a remotley good heartbreaking tale, but I can't quite put my finger on it. There's just something so indescribile about this movie...maybe how curiously short it is, but how it seems much longer, or the fact this movie is too fantasy-like, or maybe that this movie was ""divided"" into chapters, narrated by mice. But either way, there's just something about this movie I don't think I'll ever figure out."
5,Who can forget the goose having a hissy fit at the window?,"The movie Babe is so completely filled with memorable and hilarious gags and scenes and one-liners that it's hard to pick a favorite.I'm a sheep pig.Baa-Ram-Ewe.The goose flapping outside the window.The farmer's wife passing out on the motel bed.Etc., etc., etc...Marvelous, marvelous tale of a little pig on an Australian farm who is adopted by the farmer's border collie and trained to herd sheep. The improbable movie turned into the surprise hit of 1995, the video has probably been bought by more families than any other film of recent memory. With its message of hope and salvation, it's a hilarious and sentimental film you can watch again and again."
5,Amazing and moving!,"The dvd is great for Spanish as well as English speaking households. Both languages are well dubbed and the cinematography is magnificently beautiful. The Spanish version contributes a quirkier, more ethnic humor that just cannot be translated into English. Highly recommended, you will want to see it over and over again. Wish there was a widescreen version."
1,Do not buy this disc; you will be forced to watch 10 minutes of advertisements,"The movie is great. This disc will end up in your trashcan in pieces unless you have the patience of a saint. Universal pictures has decided that you are paying them for the imperative privilege of watching ten minutes of previews. /Dumb/ previews, through which you cannot fast forward and from which you cannot access the main menu. Buy the movie elsewhere or pirate it."
5,"A TRESURED, CHARMING, & SO CUTE!",This has beed on my top favorite movie lists since i was 2 years old. the songs are GREAT! It reminds me of my childhood. This story has talking animals but they don't talk to humans. It is very sweet and charming and you will be missing out on a lot of you don't watch it! Great family movie!
5,the best!,"suitable for wide span of ages, adults included... beautifully made. One of my favorite ""kid"" movies of all time! watch it"
4,Classic,"I can't say much that other reviewers haven't already said. This is a sweet, charming movie with talking farm animals and a decent story. The characters of the animals are pulled off nicely, and if you enjoy films with talking animals, then give this a try!"
5,Perfect Classic,This dvd should be in every collection of great movies. We loved it the first time andactually re-watch in at least once a year. Good old fashion love story between man and pig.
4,Great film with one disappointing note,"Absolutely splendid film, enjoyable by both children (other than the very young) and adults alike. The big disappointment, though, is the lack of widescreen format, especially missed in a film with such breathtaking cinematography, for which I've docked this DVD a star. Now available at half the price in a two-DVD package with the lesser sequel, ""Babe : Pig in the City""."
1,Too sad!!!,"I'm sorry, but my eyes were filled with tears through the entire movie!!! Sure, it's nice seeing the animals talk, but it's SOO 'darn' sad! It's just another depressing animal movie.If you love animals and want a good bawl, this movie's for you."
1,Not Good At All,"This is the WORST movie I have EVER seen. We had to see it in our class one day. The teacher said that I HAD to watch. Reluctantly, I sat down. I hated it. She fast forwarded it to the middle so we could see the end. Even that part was bad, and I didn't see all of it! I'd give it -10 stars for horrible scenes, cruelty to animals, and lack of trying. DON'T SEE IT EVER!!!"
2,Unskippable ads,"The pre-roll ad is unskippable. And long. And obnoxious. I paid for the DVD, I shouldn't have to wait through a 2 minute commercial to watch it."
2,Forced child inappropriate previews,"The movie is a classic, but I wouldn't purchase this DVD again. You are forced to sit through 10 minutes of previews, some of which are inappropriate for kids. There is no way to skip through the previews."
2,Babe is fine - Universal ruins the DVD,"When placing Babe in the DVD player I was not able to fast forward, jump to the main menu, etc. until _after_ all the movie previews on the DVD were played. My daughter actually stood in front of the TV and started to cry because she wanted the movie to start. Shame on Universal for ruining what is supposed to be a fun experience. I've paid for the DVD - I should have full control over what is shown and not be forced to watch yet more advertising. I'll be asking for my money back on this DVD."
3,"Better than the first, at least it ends with the Dundees back in Aus...","The action is fast paced, it's very funny,in a serious way and the actors outstanding.Plus it ends in Australia. And the very badguys get cacked! I loved it (three-and-a-halfstars out of four)!"
3,Crocodile Dundee II,"Not as good as the first Crocodile Dundee, but still entertaining. Paul Hogan is a natural for this part and plays it well. Linda Kozlowski has chemistry with Hogan on screen and it shows. It's not academy award material, just good fun."
5,Voted movie of the Decade in my hometown,In my hometown of New Brighton Pennsylvania Dundee 2 was voted movie of the decade. The story line was a bit complikated for most of us to handle but we felt it was the movie that best represended our small town. Hogan was brilliant. A must see.
3,Crocodile II,It is entertaining. Nice pictures. Paul Hogan is funny. However I think Crocodile Dundee I was better than the #II.
1,"Weak, very weak!","My ex-boyfriend Jeff and I rented this movie a while back and we had very different opinions. I thought the movie was childish, stupid and just simply not dope. Jeff on the other hand thought it was a great movie. I feel it takes a very warped individual to like this movie. This may be why I have since dumped Jeff and moved in with my new boyfriend Jermaine."
3,Slow Moving But Good Nevertheless,This wasn't Jayne Krantz best. But it was still Good. You have stick with the story closely. Because it gets repeative before it gets to the meat of the story. The story starts out with Irene investigating the death of her childhood friend. Was it really suicide or murder? I would give this 3.5 stars.
3,PUZZLING TITLE!,"Haven't read Krentz for a while but remembered I always like her books.This was a 17 year old mystery to be solved by the heroine Pamela with the help of Luke, an ex Marine with a story to tell. These two were so entertaining I just loved the repartee. Luke's responses to Pam's jibes were excellent and entertaining. I sort of got the answer rather quickly to this mystery but it came as a shock anyway.Each chapter had a ending to make you continue to solve this mystery. Luke's brother was a howl and the book kept up a fast pace. All the loose ends were tied up at the end. Good read."
2,Jayne has lost all sense of whimsey,"I have enjoyed Jayne's older novels like ""Wildest Hearts"" and ""Trust Me,"" but her more recent books have been plot driven without likeable characters. I especially don't recommend spending $25.00 for a hardback. Wait for the paperback or better yet, check it out of your local library. I already donated my copy."
3,"Not bad, but VERY poor narration","I may have enjoyed this story more if I had read it, which is certainly unusual. The audio version was presented with a male and female reader, which is usually wonderful. These readers, however, had unpleasant, nasal voices. It made it very hard to get into the mood, and neither had the slightest sex appeal. The male voice was especially unpleasant. I hope Ms. Krentz contracts others to read her next novel.Almost anything JAK writes is worth reading or listening to, and all her other audiobooks have been very well done. Hope this is a temporary abberation!!"
1,skimmed to the end,"This reminded me of a Nancy Drew story in which Nancy gets laid, more than once. If this seems vulgar, then prepare yourself for a big surprise if you read this book. Contrived ""in the nick of time"" encounters hobble the already weak suspense, and stereotypes abound. You'll be happier with some James Lee Burke."
3,So-So,"It's really hard for me to give one of JAK's books only three stars, but this was definitely not one of her best efforts. The suspense was so-so and the romance wasn't particularly exciting. It was believable (the romance, that is), which is more than many relationships in romances, but it wasn't very emotionally satisfying. In fact, if it weren't for the well-written dialogue and believable romance, I'd have given this only two."
3,"3 1/2 Easy, interesting book","As usual JAK aka Amanda Quick aka Jayne Castle knows how to keep you interested. (I always wonder why they write under different names? Confuses me). This book was a light, easy read that I finished fairly quickly. Nothing new but still a good book. I liked both main characters. No gratuitous sex scenes, some writers these days are going way overboard with the sex every other page. You get the feeling that these two characters really like each other."
5,Better than advertised,"This is my second piece of Analon cookware and I really do ""love it"". It's just the right size for not worrying if something is going to run over the sides while cooking on high heat. It's heavy duty and nonstick as advertised. I will buy this as a gift for someone else in the future."
1,Non-stick Coating Wore Off and is Chipping After Three Months,I bought this pan with high expectations given the strong reviews from other customers but after a few months of use I am very disappointed. The pan takes several coats of oil to prevent food from sticking and now the non-stick surface is beginning to flake off. I always washed the pan by hand and never used anything other than plastic cooking utensils. The last non-stick pan I had was Kirkland brand and it lasted four years.
5,"No more burning things, easy cleaning","I've used this pan a few months now, and the non-stick part is still working just fine. I usually just rinse in really hot water, and wipe it clean. This pan heats evenly, and has solved my burning problems on my all electric stove, especially at the center of previous pans. I has nice square sides so the food isn't always trying to slide to the middle, so it effectively gives you more usable cooking space. One hidden gotcha, the manualy saw to never use more than medium heat, but it cooks just fine at medium since the heat is spread out better. You might need another pan if you want to seer something over high heat, however, but that's probably true of any non-sitck coating."
5,Walking the walk you talk.,I appreciate this author because he speaks from experience. He uses a straight forward approach which I also relate too. The book is in excellent condition as have been all the used books I have purchased. Thank you. Signa
3,One of the Weakest Nero Wolf Books,"It is difficult for me to rate any Nero Wolf story less than excelent, but this one must be so rated. It seems to vary sharply from others in the series. This is especially true of the first story ""Not Quite Dead Enough."" Wolf seems close to delusional. Lily Rowan is not the same cool Lily, but some sort of frantic man-chasing vamp.This book was probably quickly written by Stout who was busy at the time in promoting the war effort."
4,good but not his best,"Although written in the 1940s, and using an unusual ""in the army"" scenario, this Nero Wolfe mystery still holds up well, not nearly as dated as you would assume. As always, Wolfe's sidekick, Archie Goodwin, supplies plenty of irreverence and laughs ... and he always gets the girl. Not the strongest in the Nero Wolfe series, but still a thoroughly enjoyable read."
3,Archie in the Army,"This book, like the previous one (Black Orchids) is really two novellas which came out in the same book. Both were written during World War II and both are set during that same period, with Archie Goodwin in the Army as a Major, and Wolfe eating health food and doing exercises in order to get fit to join the Army. The usual humor is there, particularly in Archie's observations about the state of the brownstone in his absence. But the plots are neither as clever nor as convincing as those in the novels, and in many ways this book is an aberration from the other Wolfe novels. The military people seemed like props: not convincing. But if you enjoy the Nero Wolfe books, it's worth reading this one just so you don't miss any part of the oeuvre."
4,Not Quite Dead Enough Was More Than Good Enough,"I have not read Rex Stout. This was a gift for my son and is the tenth Rex Stout mystery he has read. He liked it and said to give it four stars. Apparently it's funny, so I think I'll stay up late tonight and read it too."
1,Do not order if you want JUST calcium!,"I ordered this looking for a calcium supplement. This came with Magnesium, Zinc, Copper, and some other crap. First of all, I already take magnesium so now I CANNOT take this or I will be super loading on magnesium. BUT the bigger issue is the inclusion of zinc. Zinc, when taken with Calcium, is NOT absorbed. This is a waste of zinc."
1,not a pure grade/ too big/ hard to swallow & digest,"I won't ever buy it again. I was looking for pure grade and easy to digest, but with citrate. Big mistake!"
2,end user,"I can't get modulated video signal on a digital TV with channel set @33 or any other channels. With the help of a combiner I am able to watch modulated video and regular cable on an analog TV set. Also there is a problem of switching from one mode of signal to another(ie.:IRC,HRC,STD). If I am able to do the switching is somehow by luck although I followed exactly what the instruction says."
4,Love it,I bought this to use with my clarisonic skin brush. I have some enlarged pores and a few breakouts off and on in my T zone.This works well with my clarisonic and cleans the T zone throughly without drying out my skin overall. Nice scent and didn't cause more breakouts or any rashes.
5,Raw & Ballsy,Raw & ballsy... Jimmy at his best. Like no one else. He'll rip your heart out and rock you out of any stupor you may be in. Get it and be amazed.
3,...dissapointed,"The first two albums The Streets put out blew me away. Original Pirate Material was fresh and abstract while A Grand Don't Come For Free was full of heart-felt tracks that I couldn't help but love. It seems with this album, Mike Skinner got lazy. The music, while catchy, is hardly original and the lyrics... aren't even in the same league as the first two albums. When You Wasn't Famous, the first single is just alright. I actually prefer the Professor Green remix. This album is mostly filler, with a few good tracks like Never Went To Church. Overall, I do like this album, it just doesn't compare to the first two."
2,am i too old?,"somehow i can't avoid making comparisons to the last franz ferdinand and brian wilson albums. it's weird what industry gets hyped regardless of whether it's old burnt-out dinosaurs or young fresh ones.i like this enough to hope the earlier works are better, as people seem to suggest.there are some moments here...especially towards the second half that do start to creep in but not nearly enough to suggest permanent ""genius"" status. my favorite songs were two nations (the least personal track)and never went to church (the most-personal track). for the most part this (like most of today's rap) makes me simply miss the old likes of x-clan, poor righteous teachers....public enemy...and even good old eminem.mcc>"
1,"Guys talking over a beat, great!","This is a joke right?! I honestly thought this group was a hiphop parody group at first because I figured nobody could be that bad on purpose. These British rappers are hiliarous, they basically talk over a beat and it doesn't even rhyme half the time. I got given this cd for free and I still want some money back!"
5,Geezers stay excited...,"Excellent album after a few listens. Love the concept of how Brits ""invented the language"" not us Yanks so don't tell us Brits how to speak. :-)Each album has been different, and that shows artistic development (not that Mike Skinner needed to prove that to me).Would be nice to have some Grime or Drum'n'Bass remixes to play in the clubs. How bout it Mikey?"
4,tasted good,"I was looking for a chocolate bar without vanillin, and this chocolate bar had real vanilla. It tasted good, the kids liked them."
1,Terrible,"If you want to be put in a bad mood, then read this book. I've had the book for a few weeks now and I still haven't found one funny joke. The author of this book must be the guy at the party that drives you crazy with tons of jokes that are not funny. I highly recommend that this book be destroyed.(...)"
1,The Worst!,"These jokes are the worst! Not even good for a courtesy laugh! Do not waste your money on this lame collection of unfunny jokes with a few four letter words thrown in to call them ""dirty""."
1,Worse than surgery,"The jokes in this book are not only unfunny, they are not worthy of actually being called jokes. I have flipped through many of the pages in search of a good laugh and haven't found anything remotely close. I rarely post reviews. Out of curiosity I looked up this book on Amazon and saw someone posted 5 stars.This person is clinically insane.I am _that_ driven to post just to bring the average rating down. You will get more laughs with your seven dollars by renting Les Miserables."
3,Adds a lot of weight!,I loved the Cycle-On Pro 2 bike rack I received last week. I gave it a rave review. I wish I could be as enthusiastic about the add-on but I can't. It works the same way but it just adds too much weight. I can barely lift the the entire 3 bike rack assembly. It's really heavy! This add-on is just not practical for every day use. I stuck this thing down in the basement for emergency situations when I have to carry a 3rd bike.
4,Better than Expected - Worth Recommending,"I have listened for years to slightly ""doctored"" classic music to enhance concentration, focus, and relaxation. I find these tapes worked very well for me even when I was writing/editing long narratives such as grants, etc. I do not like a lot of ""new age"" music, I tend to find it too spacey - it's ok when you are getting a massage, but not okay for staying focused, yet relaxed on a time-consuming project. I wondered if I would like this CD and if it would work. I like all the tracks well enough to listen to all of them and, at the beginning of the day or work session, I find listening to them in sequence helps me find a very productive state of mind. Once I get going, though, I tend to listen only to the second half of the disk. I would definitely recommend this CD, especially to writers."
3,"Amazing Music, but....","Jimi Hendrix's appearance at the 1969 Woodstock festival with his band, Gypsy Sun & Rainbows, was iconic and belongs in every fans collection. However, this is the same mix as the 1999 re-issue. There were six musicians onstage; however, only Jimi hendrix, Mitch Mitchell, and Billy Cox can be heard. Additionally, two songs that were sung by Larry Lee, ""Gypsy Woman"" and ""Mastermind"" were left off. It would have been nice if the Hendrix Estate released the ENTIRE set in a mix where Larry Lee, Juma Sultan, and Jerry Velez could be heard. If Jimi Hendrix believed that all the musicians deserved top share the stage with him, then they should be heard. If the product was to be re-released, the estate should have done this - they didn't; so, buy a used version of the 1999 version and save yourself some cash and not reward the Jimi Hendrix Estate or Sony for selling fans the exact same product."
1,"Incomplete, missing musicians","This release is missing two of the songs from the original performance at Woodstock, ""Gypsy Woman"" and ""Mastermind."" Hendrix only performed these songs at the Woodstock show; therefore, their historic value is impossible to deny. Yet these songs are not on this release!Additionally, this album does not include some of the other musicians' performances. The guitar of Larry Lee, for example, has been mixed out, along with other percussion and singing.This release could have been the definitive edition of Jimi Hendrix's legendary performance at Woodstock. Instead, it represents almost nothing beyond the 1994 Alan Douglas :Woodstock release."
2,Why Couldn't We Get the Uncut Concert??????,"It's a mystery to me why the Hendrix family (ExperienceHendrix) couldn't release the complete and uncut recording of this performance. Instead of releasing the complete recording of this historic concert, the Hendrix family has edited (or deleted) instrumental sections (from songs), guitar solos, some of Hendrix' comments between songs, Larry Lee's solos, most of the percussion section, and two songs (Gypsy Woman and Mastermind).The Hendrix family has announced in the past they have hours of live recordings. It's probably safe to say that we can expect more of the same with regard to these future recordings, that is edited songs, deletion of songs, etc.Unfortunately, we'll never be able to experience these shows complete and uncut. Despite Jimi's musical prowess and talent, which is in abundance on this recording, I can't recommend it."
4,Good stuff even with musicians edited out!,"Great music from Jimi and the boys.One thing-I distinctly remember a Mitch Mitchell drum solo.Furthermore, where is that other guitar player?And the congas or bongos (or whatever-can't be sure)?Why try and remake history?Sheesh...music biz people-can't leave well alone.Nevertheless,a must for serious Hendrix fans and collectors."
1,Trash,I have a good collection of hendrix and heard much more; this is trash cashing in on the extremely overrated concert of its name. The band is very spotty and really juiced making them all completely unable to follow Jimi's talent (which shines through in SSB and the long solo afterwards - pretty much the only highlights of this disc) You would be much better off with Band of Gypsies or Live at the Fillmore. In this vein Isle of Wight works from a more solid foundation. Do note that Jimi never played with this band again.
5,music raw&hard,jimi talks and plays with the crowd and then explores and unloads then steps back and re-aims.that's what this disc sounds like to me.he can solo and groove and keep people in the palm of his hands and then stop on a dime.this is a must have for folks who enjoy sheer raw talent and history .jimi was ahead of the curve.
5,"EXCELLENT, BUT DISHONEST","A good mix, much better than the '94 botch-job. A few criticisms however. Kramer did make tracks like 'Spanish Castle Magic' & 'Lover Man' listener-friendly by editing out Lee's lead guitar, but in doing so he has altered the character of the original performances. They are good examples of Gypsy Sun & Rainbows band workouts. [Brilliant but flawed.] Why alter the truth? 'Jam Back at the House' could have been left unedited too. Gone are both the percussionists' solo and Mitch's drum solo. Why? The lax percussion break offers the song a little space. Apart from these minor complaints the rest of the tracks are well edited."
5,great,I love this book just as much as i love 'The Last One.' I feel that this is a great book for all guys and girls that like things about angels and demons. it is very well written an d while reading it i found myself not wanting to stop. so for a short time i was late doing my homework as well as my lesson plans.
3,Great Learning Aid/But Slow,"I really enjoy this software. The illustrations are live and that is so much better than the illustrations in the books I have. But the only problem is for example: when you are using the two dictionary disc, after you request a few signs the program starts to get reallllllllll slow. You request a sign for a word and it takes forever to process and load. I bought a laptop specifically for this software so I could travel with it.I thought something was wrong with the laptop so I returned it.I have since loaded this software at work and at home and the same thing happens. You have to shut the program down and start it up again to gain the initial speed. And of course there are eight disc. You can't load but one disc at a time.If they could just fix these two things, this learning tool would be prefect."
2,Good content; poor software.,"A good introduction to ASL, but a pain to get the CDs to work together. This should be on DVD -- or allow you to put all the content on your hard drive. Several times when I had CD3 in the drive, the software told me that I had to insert CD3. I could not find any tech support.On the positive side, the presentation of signs at optional speeds is great. Adding grammar is a real plus!"
1,Don't Bother,I bought this program to load onto my laptap for school and work. You can only download the installation cd. You cannot load the other 7 cd's onto your hard drive. For anyone who does not want to have to tote around a bunch of cd's this is not the program for you. I have emailed the company to see if an upgrade will be released but I have not received a reply yet. I am now looking for a program that can be completely loaded onto my hard drive. This was a waste of money.
3,"Great Concept, Trouble Accessing","Don't know why, but my computer (with Windows XP) has trouble accessing the disks. Have not been able to get the dictionary to work at all, but have been able to access the information on the other disks, after constantly retrying. Once there, the information is invaluable and I love the quizzes. Really helps to sharpen skills. Just wish I could access the dictionary!"
3,American Sign Language,"Well, it was not really what I was expecting and I am having some problems to visualize some topics on disc 2. I tryed to reinstall but it does not work out. But after all I still think that it will be helpful to me to improve my knowledge about ASL."
2,not convienient,this product looked great but 8 CD...please !!! not easy to drag around 8 Cds. have to switch cd everytime... beware that th MAC version is cheaper than the windows version.
1,NO TITLE,Instant Immersion American Sign Language DeluxeTried using this DVD. Came without instructions. Never use it.Not recommended.
4,Got my money's worth,"I am still a new user but so far I am learning a lot from the collection of cd's. First, the program installs easily, all you have to do is put in cd 1. The videos are very clear and the wording that goes with each video is a big help in clarifying.The only down side so far is sometimes a box appears when you are using cd2 (dictionary) and it tells you in order to watch the video insert cd3. This can be a minor nuisance but thankfully only happens once in a while. Has a great search tool as well. You just type in the word you want to sign and hit enter.Overall I am very happy with it, especially for the money. Never ending words and phrases."
4,Helpful ASL Software,"My newest daught-in-law is deaf, and suffice it to say, I knew no sign language when I met her. I purchased this product to help us communicate. The dictionary has been a real help and the videos are great for learning. I quickly learned some basic phrases and I, as well as the rest of my family, are learning more each day!"
4,"Needs a little work on installation, yet","ASL Deluxe 8-CD edition is a considerable improvement over the older, 5-CD edition. That edition only worked with old, now-unsupported versions of Java, but the current one works with Java 1.6.On Windows, you'll need to install the latest Quicktime and the lastest Java Virtual Machine before you install ASL Deluxe, and you'll also need to fix program shortcuts if you intend on having limited users, or more than one user, run it. The shortcut installation is pretty sloppy for an application made since Windows XP's release.Fortunately, that's all you need to fix. ASL Deluxe otherwise runs correctly, and the live signers performing the signs are a great replacement for the 3D animated signers in the previous release.You'll find complete installation instructions here:http://www.antiwindowscatalog.com/?mode=product&id;=121"
2,Sign Language,"The video portion frequently skips. The signers have different hand motions, so it can be hard to tell the same sign. Would be interested to see a rating system of beginner, intermediate, advanced from Instant Immersion on their product(s)."
3,The Butterly Effect,"I love the first one it is amazing, I really wasn't too thrilled about the second one. But at the price I was getting for the both of them you really couldn't go wrong. So hey you have to be willing to compromise."
5,great movie,"i love this movie, the second one isn't that great but the price was so great for the double feature that i opted from purchasing just the 1st movie, great price"
3,Five stars for part one. One for part two.,"I've never been a big Ashton Kutcher fan. I didn't like him in That 70's Show, so it took a long timefor anyone to convince me to watch this movie.I was blown away. It was one of the saddest movies I have ever seen. Do you ever think about fate? Isthere such a thing? That, no matter what choices we make, we are doomed to screw up our lives and the livesof our friends? The first B.E. was well-written, well-acted, and had me personally invested in the peopleinvolved. Highly recommended.The second movie, however, was nothing but a pale, poor shadow of the first. I was so bored, I wanted toturn it off halfway through, but I forced myself to finish it. It never got any better. Don't bother towatch B.E. 2."
4,butterfly effect 1 & 2 dvds,"like the movies alot, and that i was able to get em both for a good price"
5,Kevin Ayers and this whole world,"How one band, let alone one English town, could've produced both a Robert Wyatt and a Kevin Ayers is beyond my imagination. I'm not familiar with Kevin's later works, but of his early post Soft Machine work, i find this to be the most challenging and rewarding. The album is four tracks long, though all are the containers for several lovely songs that are pieced together through sound collages and disjointed jams. Fans of Gorkys Zygotic Mynchi, Super Furrys, and OTC should definitly give this a try. I would suggest also ordering it directly from the label's (BGO Records) website where it can be purchased for 10 pounds."
3,Innovative Approach But Superficial,"The video tries to make the Kings and Queens of England into real people and delves into some of the current events surrounding their reigns, but is highly selective in the information that it provides. The history professor who provides commentary really does not add much to the presentation."
4,False motives,"This Agatha Christie novel has a deliciously complex plot with the usual twists and turns which are uncovered by the inimitable Hercule Poirot. A young woman named Rosaleen has married a man named Underway. Upon Underway's death, Rosaleen remarries a wealthy man named Gordon Cloade. He dies two weeks after the marriage, which makes Rosaleen a very wealthy widow indeed. She and her brother come to take over Cloade's home and fortune, much to the dismay of Cloade's family who have lost a fortune to her. Soon a man comes to town and claims that Rosaleen's first husband, Underway, is not dead, meaning Rosaleen is still married to him and so should not inherit Cloade's fortune. People begin to die and one of the Cloade men asks for Hercule Poirot's help in solving the mystery. Poirot interviews the people involved, gets his little gray cells working and puts together the puzzle to solve the murders. This is another wonderful book by the world's most famous mystery author."
5,"Excellent, Fun read","This is a cool book. I love his writing style and the information was very helpful to me.PLUS, I worked with Ken for years and never knew he was a mountain man with a beard!!"
2,Disappointing sound quality,"I bought the Pico for my wife, and was pretty excited to put it to use on a recent long car ride, but I was very disappointed in the sound quality. After following the directions closely (being careful to tune to a channel that was indeed empty static) the music came through, but the frequency response seemed truncated on both the high and low ends. We also noticed that unless we placed the transmitter in a couple of select (and somewhat inconvenient) locations, the signal was somewhat crackly. Overall I'm disappointed, although if you have low expectations for sound quality, this product might be for you."
1,WASTED MONEY,"I WISH I HAD NEVER BOUGHT IT.IT DOESN'T WORK AT ALL IN THE CITY, AND BARELY IT DOES ON ROUTE.TOTAL WASTE OF MONEY."
5,A MUST For Any Library,"This is one of the BEST books that I have found. Not only does the author tell you important information, she has a great sense of humor and style. This book not only tells you what herbs to use for what purpose, she also tells you how to grow them. I found this book just in time to start my own garden. I found so much important information, and now have a great garden growing. I have recommended this book to all my friends."
