5,"The penguin gives it ""two flippers""","Death and the Penguin is a gem, humorous and outlandish. Much of the story is ridiculous, but told in a way that seems believable. The use of matter-of-fact prose and a melancholy penguin provide a unique view of post-Soviet Russia. Highly recommended."
3,"Culturally interesting, but....","Can't say that I'd recommend this. It's just so very low key, lacking in ""I can't put it down"" excitement. But then, I do tend towards pulp fiction detective novels."
5,contemporary ukrainian literature,"I don't think as a review, the ""summary"" of the book should be written. I also found the ending of the book not dissappointing at all, but the only explanation to the events. A bit of a shock it was to tell you the truth."
1,graphomania,"Do not waste your time on this 'post-soviet-era' Russian author. There are plenty of so called ""writers"" there now who do not know their own language. Graphomania."
4,Very nice watch for the Money,"I recently bought this watch for my wife as a daily wear. She loves the watch and the bracelet band on it. Many people have commented on liking the ""heart"" shaped band without it being too obvious.Any problems: Not really however Bulova the parent company of Caravelle has started switching from the thin clasps because they unclasp to their new sizes. I do not believe these are available on their lower priced model lines like the Caravelle.Do I recommend... absolutely. For the money, a very nice high quality watch good for a casual evening or for professional wear."
2,Not ready for primetime,"Plays a bit like a college freshman vocal recital. The voice is occasionally pitchy, but more offensive is the inconsistant vocal technique!!! He can't decide whether he wants a classical edge or a pop-breathiness. Sometimes he goes back and forth between these two very different sounds note after note after note.The ""fuller voice"" is way to far in his nose and going back and forth between such a light breathy tone and this just makes the nasality more obvious!Great potential in this voice, but he seems too unsure of what he wants to do with his voice to be selling commercial albums just yet!"
4,Los Rieleros del Norte,Leonel Garcia is just another of decent album that Polo Urias made. But if your a fan of Ranchero music then I would recommend on buying this album.
3,"Love it, but not the same toy as in picture.","My dog LOVES her squirrels. Her first one was a gift, and was like the one pictured above, in this listing. But, when we ordered her a new one, we realized the ""PLUSH"" squirrel is not the same as in the picture. It is filled with stuffing, and some of the fabric is different. She still really likes it, but my complaint is that it is not as easy to clean off, and if it gets left in the yard, it is not waterproof and gets waterlogged.I would still recommend it, but I prefer the non-plush squirrel.UPDATE April 15, 2009They have now changed the picture in this listing. The picture shown IS the plush flying squirrel and is accurate.UPDATE Nov 11, 2010I don't know WHY they keep changing the picture in this description, but once again, this picture is showing the WRONG product."
5,Homelessness and The Good Mother,I loved this book and couldn't put it down. The author really made the women come alive and I feel like I got a first hand glimpse into the lives of mothers struggling to make ends meet. This book is for anyone interested in why people become homeless and what it would take -- personally and politically -- to get back on track. The stories are fascinating and enlightening -- it's absorbing reading and you'll learn a lot from it.
1,How convenient for Mr. Berkeley....,"To completely ignore a number of situations that did not easily fit into the picture Mr. Berkeley was so carefully trying to weave.The bottom line was this is a classic, marxist-like, half-truth laden revision of history that is more akin to ""blame game"" dynamics than scholarly research of facts."
4,Love this lipcolor,I've tried many lipsticks and this is my favorite by far. The color stays all day. For some reason this product can not be foumd at local stores - at least at in this color. I've been buying it on line from Amazon for the past two years. The Winedrop is my favorite.
2,Not big enough....,"This is WAY TOO SMALL for the price. I expected a bit larger bag. Also, everything falls out when you bend down to dig or pick up aaan object. I am not happy at all with this purchase. The trowel, however, is nice. Strong and durable. But besides that, dont waste your money. Buy something at another store. This one is going back."
1,disapointed,the battery had chalky residue on the ends cleary the battery s were bad had to send them back. wast of time.
1,does NOT work on a MAC,this game is labeled as working on mac or pc - it does not work on a mac - I am sending it back
5,wonderful product,This game is wonderful for my 4 year old. She plays it all the time.There is enough to do that she doesn't get bored and it is age appropriate so that I don't have to help her constantly. I'm really glad we bought it.
1,"Run away, and run away fast!","We have a brand new computer with an intel processor, and windows XP, and I CANNOT get this game to install and work. It is NOT lack of system requirements. It requires Quicktime 4 to run, and seeing as I have quicktime 7.5, I begrudgingly uninstalled the better quicktime and reinstalled 4, and the darn thing STILL wouldn't work. THEN, I couldn't get 4 to get off so that I could reinstall 7.5. I had to use the system restore to fix the damage this CD caused me to do. I tried uninstalling and reinstalling a number of times, finally I have given up and have resigned myself to the fact that I purchased a $10 coaster."
3,Daughter enjoys it but...,Really neat graphics and my daughter has a lot of fun with it but I had to load it at her grandmothers house because it does not work if you have more than 1G of memory - the company sent us one that would work on our system but it's not the same and not as good.
5,dollhouse game,This is a very cute game. The only draw back is its difficult to get back to the beginning. My 4 yr old likes this. Some of the characters say really funny things. It has a uniqueness to it.
1,Bitter Tears of Regret,"What a waste of twenty bucks. Slow, not funny, utterly lackingcharm or inventiveness. My six year old pumpkin is, appropriately, not interested."
2,Not one of our favorites,"Our three very computer literate daughters (ages 3 to 5) didn't respond to this game. The graphics were much slower to come up on screen than other games of this type and you don't get to be very creative with where you put the items in each room. They also didn't like that the click and drag didn't work as well as it does in the Little Mermaid II game. Overall, we wouldn't recommend this one."
1,cinderellas dollhouse LG,I had trouble downloading CD. my screen went blank then could not get it out. had to unplug & take battery out to get CD out
1,Does not work with Mac OS or Windows XP!,"This game will not work on a Mac with OS X 10.5 or above! It must run in classic mode. See Disney's support page:[...]Also this game will not work if you are running Window's XP and your system has more than 1 GB of memory (and what PC doesn't these days). If you do you will see this msg : Error: Dollhouse.exe has encountered a problem and needs to close. We are sorry for the inconvenience.Again see Disney's support page:[...]So, a house full of Mac's and PC's and this game will not run on any of them! Stay away from this out of date game!!!!!!"
1,What a Rip-off and waste of money!!!,This is a joke! Worse than a 12year old's home video of a family trip!I expected to experience the wonderful drives around the Island of Maui and all you see are a couple of spots of the cliffs and people going on a walking tour of the sugar cane fields or a lame 3 man Luau.We Never drive - or see the scenery!The audio was weird and hollow sounding and the video could have been of any island in the world!Wow - how did they get to sell this on Amazon?
2,A Disappointing Drive,"The film showed very little of this Great Drive, The Road To Hana, with the camera shoots being taken from the back seat over the driver's shoulder and with the rear vision mirror blocking any views. There was more shoots taken of the cameraman's traveling compainion walking to the attraction than of the attractions and too much time was spent showing what you can eat. This was a disappointing Great Drive."
3,ok product,"This works to an extent, but a discontinued product called Natrol Carb. works bettr. I think it had a higher level of white bean extract."
4,Seems to work well,"I've been using this product for just over a month and would like to give it another month before I make a final judgement. It does seem to work so far, although it's hard to tell if it's truly blocking all of the carbohydrates or not."
1,I don't like it,"I was expecting something easy this is hard to cut your hair.. You kinda have to shove it.. I'm glad I got the other razor also, but it too wasn't all that great."
2,Professional tool,"I purchased this thinking I could reduce my trips to the barber shop, this razor comb is for professionals only or just not for me."
4,Razor Comb,The Diamond Edge 2 Way Razor Comb is a very good tool. I have thick hair and it grows fast. It gives me an extra 2 weeks for me to get to the hairdressers. It is easy to use and the price was good. I would recommend it.
5,Magic,I love it... Very Useful! no need to go to salon to pay $30 for a simple trim...This its beyond what i expected..I use it to cut my little sister's bangs and it works well it looked so natural.Also works for guys like me(korean hairstyle)Saves a lot of money.. dont hesitate to buy
4,Cool,"Works pretty well, comes with an extra razor, my self-done hair cuts look fantastic. Only complaint is that I can't quite get the razor back in the right spot after taking it out to clean out the hair, and it doesn't seem to close well anymore--it occasionally falls apart (opens up and the razor falls out) while I'm trying to trim up my hair, which could end up being disastrous...maybe a little cheaply made, if you're really serious about cutting your hair and want a good razor comb that will last a while, maybe look for a highly quality, better made, more expensive one? Just a thought, but this is good for the price."
5,LOVE ITTTT!,"Seriously, this razor is amazing! i adore my haircut & my friends haircuts! sooo easy! perfect for shaping and thinning. i LOVE this! i'll never pay for another haircut again."
2,NOT a Stop Bulb,"Amazon had me type in the make, model, and year of my car to make sure the part fits. It fit alright, but as a tail light, not a brake (stop) light."
4,Your Dog Will Thank You!,This book was great to have as I'm not that familiar with the Tahoe area. I only got to do three hikes listed in the book but they were amazing and I probably wouldn't have known where to go w/o this book.The only thing really missing from this book is a MAP! Otherwise well worth the money.
3,"Introductory Only; Too (Two) Few ""Voices""","I found myself rather disappointed with this book, while it conveyed some important insights. It was a one-night read that didn't give me as much insight into Deaf Culture, and the why's behind the recent reawakening of Deaf pride, as such other books as Journey into the Deaf-World (which is itself weakened by an opposite shortcoming, a pingpong organization combining subjects like history [fascinating]and highly technical linguistic theory, alternating with real-life current narratives--MANY voices reflecting disparate experiences. I've marked tne linguuistics chapters--certainly important--to read later, but only after i finish The Journey into real people's lives, The voices we ""hear"" in this book are primarily those of tne authors; despite a strong beginning, the coverage feels increasingly superficial, perhaps making this best suited an intro for those journeying into the land of the Deaf for the first time,"
4,"good, quick, anecdotal intro to Deaf culture","this book is exactly as the title of the review states. It is one that you can fly through and get a good introduction into the ideas of Deaf culture. Early it explains the concepts of deaf and Deaf and it is filled with good anecdotes and a broad range of topics. While it doesn't offer too much for those with knowledge of Deaf culture and cultural issues, it does provide a great start for those that want to learn a little about Deaf culture and will offer a jumping off point for beginners. Because of it being a quick read and many good tales, for those with a strong knowledge of Deaf culture, it certainly offers a light and fast read."
3,More Experience than academic,"I had to read this book for my college ASL class. Its very good at skimming the top of Deaf culture--but it kind of left things hanging out in the breeze. The style of this book is in telling stories and explaining Deaf culture using those example. I enjoyed reading about the Deaf culture, but I don't think that this book is for anyone who wants straight facts and depth."
5,Amazing eye-opening insight into the world of a culture,"This book has opened my eyes to the rich culture of deaf people. Padden and Humphries are masters at explaining the difference between deaf and Deaf and the way Deaf people relate to the world. A must-read for everyone, especially those who want to be free of stereotypes."
5,A Good Book,I thought this book was great. I could not put it down after the third chapter. The book tells you how people lived and how they where treaded during the war and after the war ended. I would recomednd this book for any one who it a advance reader and likes a little adventure
2,Not For Me,"I got hold of this book at West Point, N.Y. but couldn't go very far with it. It's a, let me be overly kind and say, SLOW read. Maybe it works as a textbook for cadets (poor cadets). I don't know. And, I give it 2 stars for effort. But, it doesn't work for me."
5,Exciting,"This book concerns a very real,exciting,and dangerous situation.An excellent book of faith and hope.this is also a book about loving Your enemy as well as Yourself."
4,"An interesting book, unusual but truly inspired",A Christian man shares his personal spiritual journey while held hostage by kidnappers. Both exciting and true plus it has a great spiritual message.
1,Poorly written,"This book DESPERATELY needed an editor. It might have been a decent book with some help with the writing. You would think a person captured by guerillas would make an interesting story, but not in this case. Also, after the book proper was finished, there was an epilogue and appendix, which repeated some of the parts of the book word-for-word. Also, I was expecting a story, but much of the book was more of a ""how to live the Christian life"" book--which could have been fine, if that's what I had been expecting."
3,STRENGTH AND Truth in Faith,The book was a good quick read with a fair amount of thrill and sixpence. I liked the lessons on Truth to Faith that comes through loud and clear in Rescue the Captors.
5,Excellent story of faith and challenges,Well written human life story of Columbia mission field and how one man made a great impact on his captors.
4,True Stories are Better than Fiction,"I first read this story several years ago, but had loaned my book to someone else and never got it back. I wanted to have another copy for myself. It was an exciting story and Russell helps you to see this situation as it unfolds. He is captured by leftist guerrillas and held for ransom. Some of this book was written while in the encampment where he was being held in the mountains of Columbia. The book is hard to put down once you begin. Read how his family and others were involved in his release and how God used this incident to reach some of the guerrillas with the Gospel."
1,Poorly written Book,"I am going through this book in my web design course, and I must say it is one of the worst books I have gone through. Poor examples, boring excercises, and a bad layout.The author obviously had a problem with this program, or didn't test the excercise steps. Many times I found myself going through a whole excercise or chapter multiple times trying to get the process to work. Sometimes they were my problems, but most of the times, he didn't include all of the steps, and I had to go through and figure it out by myself.I suggest you stay away from this frustrating experience."
3,La Golosa,"Oh yes, this is a classic albums. But not there best there's 2 songs that they copied but they actually sound alright, other then that it's an ok album: 3 out 5"
2,Ultimate Ride maybe. Ultimate Game... no.,"I bought this game from Kmart in Australia for AUD$10.00 mainly because I absolutely love Theme Park World, I love making Roller Coasters and riding them, however in this game I found I got really bored really quickly. I built 3 roller coasters and rode them, this took me 2 hours (mainly because of the absolutely horrible viewing angles of the game), I rode them, then I got bored. This game only gives u 3 kinds of Roller Coasters to make in 4 different backgrounds, it has plenty of props, but most dont do anything, so they are all boring.I tried the Imagineering section of the game, but found it pointless and again boring. It just seems that this game had absolutely no lasting value... Great game if you can get it on special, if not. Try for Theme Park World or maybe even Roller Coaster Tycoon.Kizz"
2,Ultimated Unrealistic and Kiddy Graphics Ride,"I rented this game, and thank god I rented it instead of wasting money on it. Stick with RCT and it's great expansion packs, cause this game is saaad. Good graphics, but then again it is unrealistic and not life like. Good game for little girls who think 10 vertical loops in a row 200 feet in the air followed by a 300 foot drop into 10 helix turns is a ""REALISTIC"" coaster."
1,ultimate ride,"I got ultimate ride for christmas, but I wasn't able to use it because I didn't have enough graphic memory to support the game. I called the manufacture but he told me to upgrade my video card, or return the game because my computer is not compatable. I was surprised because I have a new computer, oh well back to the store for a refund."
1,Why get an un-realistic game?,"After buying this game, I found that it is a waste of money. For any roller coaster crazy person, I would recomend NoLimits, one of the best builders out there. (...)"
1,"Hose Job - on ""The Ultimate Ride""","Kellog's put this CD on the front of cereals trying to get kids to buy their Frosted Flakes. The front of the CD said that it is a Preview. Not Even. What a waste of my time, plastic for the CD, the wrapping ect. Hey Tony, you have truly given us ""The Ultimate Ride."" I will not be buying Kellog's products for awhile just to return the insult factor.P.S. Your scale of 1 - 5 needs to have a big zero added.Chris Moran"
1,Sad ...Sad ...Sad !!!,"If you have a lap top then forget this game. I'm very dissappointed in Disney Imaginering for this one. Most lap tops have a 4x video card, this requires a 8x. It can be run on a lap top but not well. Also, all you have is rollercoasters, you cannot build a park. I was anticipating much more from Disney.Patricia, Naperville IL"
1,Definitely not one of the best,"This game does have excellent graphics, but there is absolutely no reality in the game, it is almost as bad as the game Sim Theme Park, I would stick to Roller Coster Tycoon or wait for a better roller coaster game to come along."
2,Software problems keep this game in the station,"With the attention paid to lots of sound and colorful graphics the 3D engine was overtaxed. The point is to build and ride thrilling rollercoasters. There is an objective mode which offers some helps, yet getting through various stages of development between building and decorating to riding can take upwards of several minutes to change ""gears"". I have several software titles which require the same performance from my machine and this program is by far the slowest. I recommend sticking with offering from Electronic Arts and Infogrames."
1,Ultimate ride,"First, it took several tries to get it installed. After finally installing it, I was very disappointed, that app. 50 sec. into the game it froze up and the following screen appeared: Microsoft VisualC++Runtime libraryRun Time Error!Program: GRAM FILES\DISNEY IMAGINEERING ULTIMATE RIDE\ULTRRIDE.EXEAbnormal Program TerminationPlease help, as to what to do to get this game working.Thank u for your help"
5,A great book for hunters and other outdoor enthusiasts,"This book details the career of a legendary federal game warden who worked in Tennessee, Louisiana, Kentucky and Maryland from 1957 to 1978. It offers a great deal of insight into the work performed by state and federal wildlife officers. The book is a mix of adventure, danger, and humor. Several chapters were printed in Outdoor Life, Reader's Digest, and state wildlife and conservation magazines in the late 70s. Out of print with limited availability. ... It is sometimes offered used on amazon.com. A great book and fun to read."
4,The Prayer Amendment review,"Very interesting story of the innocence of children and the life of those around them. What would happen in our world if the prayers of our children were so clearly fulfilled as they are in this book? Although this book is occasionally ""preachy"", and not in the manner one would expect, the story itself is very intriguing and the characters are captivating. Susie and Emma, two school-aged girls around whom the story centers, keep the reader enthralled with their heartfelt prayers and the other characters jumping through hoops. It's a great read!"
1,Very Bad,This movie was just bad. Moved very slow. I could only watch about half. I would not recomend this. I am not speaking to the person who recomended it to me. Time better spent gazing at my navel.
5,"Great Film! Phew, something different~","Great film, acting was amazing. Nice to see David Duchoveny again. Vera Formiga and the young boy were equally excellent."
5,Entertaining,"A very entertaining film, which I would highly recommend. Filmed in the Tucson area and very well made. I assume it is R for the use of weed, but would be fine for teens."
3,Whacky characters,"I think I have been friends with some of characters over the years. Old hippies never die, they just get older."
1,Most boring movie,So slow and not exactly sure what the pot... I mean plot of the movie was. Don't waste you time with this one.
4,"Goats is well written, well acted and thoughtful","It is something like an insightful dramatic take on ""Orange County"". The title raises the provocative question of who the goats are in the movie. It seems to be ""us,"" that is, parents who satisfy their momentary whims, eating and procreating with whatever is convenient, and showing too little care for their children."
2,Slow and boring,"This movie was about 2 generations of potheads--which seemed to amuse and entertain the author for some reason, but I found it boring and slow."
2,where is the humor???,Not at all funny to me. I would never rated it as a comedy or given it 4 stars as the rating said. Just another bunch of dysfunction.
4,Goats,This is my kind of movie. Its quirky and offbeat with a message. Adults wraped up in their own worlds and the kids trying to get by.
2,Okay,Acting is pretty good but story line is just okay. Goat man is a wondering genius that like to play in the dirt.
4,Live but Cooked,"I'm a big admirer of Patty Griffin but I liked the original versions of Tony, Mad Mission, and Rain much better than these live versions. The orginals are more personal and passionate. I used to listen to Mad Mission over and over and the live version has a very different emotional resonance. This live version of Tony is very different from the much older live version that you can hear on KCRW's program archives. One brings tears to my eyes and the other doesn't. The sweetness, agreeability and nostalgia which permeates this performance (not to mention the cloying album art and DVD) is much less appealing to me than the potent mixture of anger, sexuality, grief and passion I felt from the originals, and from much earlier live performances I saw in Texas. High volume vocals have a bootleg sound, with a penetrating extra dollop of high frequency resonance that always makes me reach for the volume control on my CD player."
4,Wonderful,"This CD was absolutely charming and delightful. I've owned it fora couple of years or so. The sound is on the spare side, notcluttered or over-adorned. I guess the challenge here was tomake a ukulele CD without having come across as a novelty -it doesn't. Also, the sound of the ukulele really brings outthe beauty of some of the melodies. One slight criticism:the tempo of ""Summertime"" is all wrong ... James does it asan uptempo disco."
4,Works good.,Took on it vacation to copy SD camera pix to older laptop. Very compact and works as advertised.
1,Not so much,"The pluses it is small, easy to carry aroundThe minous it does NOT read all MMC cards. And since that is what it is for it makes not since to buy this product unless you know for sure yours will be read."
1,It works just for one month...,At first it works well... I've a camera that uses SD cards and it's useful to have a card reader... After the second week I have problems to detect the cards on the computer... sometimes work others not... By the month I decided to dispose of it becasuse it didn't work on any computer I try on...
5,It's like an unlimited capacity flash drive...,"I love this thing! The Kingston TravelLite feels solidly built and is even smaller than it looks in the pictures. Another thing you can't see in the picture is that it has a clip on the back. It also has a hole for attaching a lanyard or keychain, although it does not come with either. I had no problems reading or writing to a 4GB SD card. The SD card door is attached so it can't get lost. The USB cap is not attached, but I find it convenient to slide it under the clip while the reader is in use to avoid misplacing it. The cap also fits snugly so I don't need to worry about it falling off in my purse."
3,Does not seem to work with all of my SD cards,"As other reviewers have noted, it does not seem to work with all SD cards. However, when it is working it is a great little device. I wish it had something to attach it to a keychain."
3,Useful but Incomplete,It works fine with my Canon MMC and my Sandisk SD Card. But although it is a Kingston device it refuses to read my Kingston MicroSD card placed in a Kingston adapter. Fortunately my Canon camcorder is able to read and use the card fine.I was not aware that there wasn't proper standardization even in the SD memory space.
2,Not so great,"This card reader worked just fine when plugged into a Dell laptop running Windows XP Professional. I was a little disappointed by the card slot's door hinge--I would have expected it to open and close a little more smoothly. But I figured this was no big deal as it was an $8.00 card reader.Unfortunately, it crashed the OS when plugged into my Dell desktop system which runs Windows XP Home. The system simply will not recognize this device. While this may have been a fluke, I have never had any issue with any USB device into this system. At some point I may try to resolve this but I had expected this item to just work with minimal or no fuss.I am giving this item 2 stars since it worked okay on at least one version of Windows, I like the design, and the price is right."
2,"Didn't work with ""bulk"" memory card","I had to send this back to Amazon for a refund. It would not work with the ""bulk"" SD card I also bought from Amazon. Went to Office Depot locally and bought another brand of reader, and the card worked fine. I can only guess that this reader is a little sensitive to certain memory card brands."
4,I like it,"I like this SD Card Reader. The only thing that I don't like is that when I remove the cover for the USB end, there is not a really good place to store the cap. I end up sliding the cap on the clip on the back of the card reader and that works. A preferable thing would be to have a hinged lid with the lid that covers the SD card end.Very portable and works every time. I have had usb drives that don't work until a mapped drive is re-mapped to a higher letter. Ex. I had to re-map my F-Drive (a network drive) to my G-> drive so that my F-Drive name was available for the usb drive. But I did not have to do this for this SD Card reader."
5,Yep,"Does exactly what its supposed to. No mess, no fuss, no hassle. Works with all the SD cards I've tried thus far. A convenient way to get pictures from camera to computer without the camera cable. Also could be a good extra USB flash drive."
1,"Do not buy, does not work.","Formats cards incorrectly.1G SD Card will not work with this reader.It's cheap alright, so cheap you can't use it.I wasted a lot of time trying to figure out what was wrong."
1,Doesn't work for me,Didn't work for my SD Ultra II on either my iMac OS 10.4.9 or my Windows XP SP2 laptop. Exchanged for another. The replacement also doesn't work.
2,"fast card reader, but bulky and picky on cards","I had a Iogear GFR202SD for a year. After losing it recently, I decided to give this Kingston TravelLite a try. Major disappointment and I am going to buy the Iogear one againPro: fast(USB 2.0 rate) and supports SDHCCon: compatibility issue even with kingston's own 1G SD cards.bulky: it is so fat and thick that it completely blocks the remaining USB port on my laptop.exchanging the card is more awkward than the IOGEAR reader. the cap is very flimsy"
2,Bad Connection,"Every time I try to use it , I have to unplug theSD Memory Card from the reader and plug it again."
1,wrong product,The information on this product was not inclusive and I was unable to use it for my type of card. Make sure it's exactly what you desire first.
1,Horrible,"This card reader, while it looks good, doesn't function well at all. It doesn't format some cards correctly, and can corrupt your SD flash cards. When you then try to record or write files to the card, they are corrupted as well. This probably works ok as just a reader, but if you plan on writing to your flash card using this device, buy a different product."
5,Great Portable SD/MMC Reader,"This is a great USB reader for SD cards. If you don't have or want a large multi card reader and just need a small SD/MMC reader to use and carry with you, this is a great product. My son uses this to load artwork from his PC to his Nintendo Wii via an SD card and this is great for him. His PC doesn't have a card reader and he has no use for anything but an SD card reader so this is perfect. [...]."
1,Doesn't Work,IF there was a lower rating than 1...... I would use it .It would not read my SD cards and to top it off now my card refused to work in the camera.....so now I am out off pocket 7.95 and my 256Mb SD card....it's gonna cost me more in shipping to return this cotton-picking item.....
2,too old,The cover and the tape are too old and worn. It could wear out at any given time. I have decided to not invest another VHS tape again.
4,A great tape but it was missing something,I thought this was a great video and it has good episodes but it really didn't stand out from any of the other ones. Mind that Bike was a boring episode for older people to have to watch and I was diasppointed to see Bulls Eyes and have it be not so good. This is a old tape and it was Daisy's most recent performance and she's only had two other ones. Thomas Meets the Queen acts after Gordon and Thomas's accidents in Better Late than Never but it was a good episode. Special Funnel shows Peter Sam getting his new funnel which i'm sure he already had. This was a good tape but I thought a bunch of other ones were better.
1,Better Than I Thought.,"I originally wrote this as a bad review, because the player stopped working. But when I checked it out more thoroughly, I found that the USB hub it was plugged into is faulty, so it wasn't getting a good charge.I plugged it directly into the USB port, it charged and is working beautifully again.I can't seem to change the star rating above, but I'd give this little gem a 4 star rating. It's small, cute and works perfectly for me. The only reason I don't give it a five star rating, is that it's difficult to learn to navigate. Even downloading the manual didn't help much. You just have to play with it til you figure it out."
3,Some Problems - Backgound Noise - Playback Order,"I just purchased one and have two problems with it. First, there is a high pitch noise that begins when you press play. It's noticeable between tracks and during silent periods of a track. I listen to a lot of classical as well as rock. If all you listen to is rock or other music that doesn't have silent pauses or quiet passages this won't be much of an issue.More troublesome is the fact that you cannot specify the order tracks will be played. For some reason it always puts a track or two out of order. Even if I drag and drop them one at a time. Again, if it's not a big issue for you, then this product will do nicely.On the plus side - sound quality is very good with the Koss earplugs I bought. At 59.99 it's pretty cheapfor 256 Meg.In surfing the web I've found other reviewers with the same problems. Would appreciate it if anyone else out there would let me (us) know if they also have had these problems."
2,Hard to relate to,"I purchased this book after hearing glowing mention of its author on NPR. I was disappointed. Though the stories are well-written, they are difficult to relate to. Maybe it's me."
4,Good stand for the price!,I bought these on sale for $25 each. They come with the speaker adapter which is nice. A good stand for the money. May not stand up to heavy road use but than what $25 dollar stand would. Oh and the quality of the bag is good if that matters to you
1,"If you want a functional calendar, don't order this product","This so-called calendar is really just a set of 12 poster-like photos. Rather than providing spaces to write appointments for each day, it simply lists at the bottom of each page the days (S S M T W T F S S M T....) in one row and the dates (1 2 3 4 5 6....) in another row right below. Also, the pages are flimsier than those usually found in both calendars and posters. So if you want 12 Johnny Depp photos, you might like this product. If it's a functional calendar you're after, stay away."
2,Not a great calendar!,"I ordered this calendar expecting a regular calendar..but when i received it i found that it just had the days of the week written on the very bottom, then a line underneath it, then the numbered days of the month (1,2,3 etc.) there were no boxes to write things in..which is the whole purpose of a calendar! And the backround was black so you couldn't even write anything NEAR the numbers."
2,If you like your iPod stay away from iHOME,Yes it's loud and clear and surely wakes u up in the morning but beware because after leaving your Ipod on this thing for a week or two it fries your Ipod.This system was responsible for destroying the harddrive in my Ipod but luckily I had the warranty and got a new Ipod.
3,"Decent, but not great","I got the iHome in May for my birthday and I have enjoyed using it. So far it has been very durable and nothing has broken on it. However, the sound is not great. At times there is a lot of static. Also the light, even on the lowest setting, for the clock is too bright. For the money and if you want a good alarm clock radio, this is for you. However, if you want good sound, don't buy this."
5,Awesome For Travel,"I love the travel pack & the remote. I am on the road all the time without the best reception or station choices, my ipod rocks! It has made travelling so much sweeter! I also get audiobooks downloads, which makes hotel room time pass by sweetly. As for the alarm volume...compared to the wakeup call, oh well. I consider this the 2nd most valuable ipod accessory after the car radio output."
2,Buyer Beware!,"The wake-up volume on this device is so loud and unadjustable as to make it useless for bedside use as an alarm. Despite what the description says, the wake up volume is not a gradual increase and is not user adjustable (for wake to radio or iPod). It starts off loud and increases within 3-4 seconds to an level that is so loud as to distort the speakers. This is a common complaint for this unit (check out the user complaints at ilounge.com). It does look nice and works well otherwise. But it gets 2 stars for poor design of a critical function and lack of proactive company response to this problem."
1,Too Bad - Would have been a Great Product,"As I became familiar with the product, I started to fall in love with every aspect of it. Great sound, easy to use controls, lots of options. However, the designer completely missed the boat on the most important aspect of the product. This is an alarm clock first. No one buys this to replace their home entertainment center. An alarm clock that has no volume control but goes from quiet to full blast in 5 or 6 seconds is totally useless to anymore who wants to wake slowly ... and they have the nerve to label it a ""Gentle Wake"" function. I'm boxing it up and returning it."
4,Love it,"Love this little gadget although the One reviewer said it did NOT come with a remote.. he was wrong.. its tiny and I almost threw it out since it was buried in the top of the strofoam.. so PAUL B wherever you are.. the remote is in the styrofoam!!!!Sound quality is good and I love having the ipod come on first thing in the morning.. also charges your battery!! Neat find!The only down side is I WISH the dimmer was a little dimmer, although it has three settings.. its still bright and I have to cover the time next to the bed."
1,DO NOT BUY THIS!!!!!!!,"Read what everyone says about the alarm clock without volume control (0 to 85 db in about 3 seconds), and a light that is WAY too bright. This clock was designed by idiots, and was not field tested. Ihome should recall this product, and/or Apple should remove their name from association with this piece of junk. Since I got it for Christmas I can't return it, so it's headed for ebay."
2,An alarm clock that doesn't keep time...,"This product looks good and came with a nice array of adapters to fit most any iPod. Unfortunately it is not shielded for use with iPhone, and does not charge the newer models. Most glaringly, however, the clock runs slow and loses about 5 minutes every month. In an alarm clock, that is simply unacceptable."
1,Breaks down fast,"The unit worked well for approximately a year. First sign of trouble was when the back-up battery would drain even when the unit was continuously plugged in. Next, the clock began to run slow. I had to reset it every couple of weeks when I noticed I was starting to be late for work. Next, when I would try to fix the time or set the alarm, the numbers would go all over the place. Not in order, they would jump ahead or jump back even when spinning the wheel the same direction. Lastly the connection between the iPod and the system became corrupted. The speakers would be staticy and I would have to wedge a piece of paper or something between the iPod and the unit to get a connection that would hold. Eventually, I couldn't find any position that would get the iPod and the unit to connect anymore. When it was time to replace it, guess what? I didn't blow $100 on another unit. I bought a competitor for $20. So far, I like it better. Don't waste your money."
1,Lasted only a year - Company doesn't back warranty,"Within a year of purchasing this gadget for $100, the digital clock is slow and needs to be reset ever couple weeks (I KNOW! I've NEVER heard of a slow digital clock). The function button starts the wrong function (i.e. push ""ipod"" and the AM radio comes on). The volume button doesn't work at all. It's like all the wires are crossed.The really sad thing is that I've contacted iHome about the product's warranty and they refuse to help me.There are a LOT of products like this on the market. I'd stay away from iHome."
1,"CHEAP, CHEAP, CHEAP","Don't waste your money with an iHome product of any kind - including this one. Three years ago, I spent nearly $100 on a clock radio so that I could have a convenient charger for the iPod and an iPod clock radio. Several times in the last three years, I've had problems with the iPod function working properly and today the iPod connection is finally toast. What a waste of money.I'm going back to Sony. I've never had a problem with Sony electronics and will NEVER waste my money again on any iHome products. What a waste."
2,Black iHome,"I purchased 3 white iHome units at Christmas time last year and no one has had problems with them. I then purchased a black iHome in January for personal use and it would not recognize my iPod and soon after setup the speakers stopped working. I then sent this unit back to Amazon and requested a replacement. The replacement unit was delivered in a expeditious manner. However, this unit did not recognize my iPod. To ensure that it wasn't my iPod, I docked my iPod in my Bose unit with no problems. The second unit that I received provided a clock radio with good quality, but did not work with the iPod"
3,okayy,the alarm isnt that loud and i got it for the mp3 purpose but so far i cant seem to have the mp3 player be my alarm. otherwise it is very good quality.
2,great little product,worked great for less than one year then pfft. all functions ceased to work. broke my heart. then my boyfriend opened it up and blew the dust out and it's back to working like brand new. i love it.
2,Died shortly after warranty period expired,"This iPod clock radio stereo unit was ok - below average. Sound quality was adequate, a bit tinny and not very loud. I would not recommend it at all, as it only lasted about 18 months. After it quit working, we replaced with an Insignia NS-CL3801 iPod / MP3 speaker system - the Insignia is a great little system, much better than the iHome."
3,"worked great for about a yr, now broken (-ish)....","Well, looks like i fared better than some others because mine worked fine for about a year before it crapped out on me. I was pretty happy with it except i always hated that the lightest back-light setting was still too bright for my taste. Overall though when it worked it was good.....But i am upset that now the clock part is broken, doesn't light up for the past 2-3 mos. adding batteries, checking plugs/connections & the settings, nothing worked. so it will play ipod music & the radio works but i can never read the time now unless i get up close bend down & stare straight at it. what a pain in the morning when i'm trying to keep an eye on the time so i'm not late to work. So now i use my cell phone alarm & check the time on that til i can replace this thing."
3,Volume is a problem,"I enjoy this product immensely except when I am going to sleep and when I am waking up. The screen is super bright so I can only sleep facing away from the clock now. The ""Gentle Wake"" feature must have been tested by people who were fully awake in an office building (or at a construction site) not people who are using this as a way to make waking up easier. The 3 second race to get to the volume button down before my roommate or neighbor starts banging on the wall is not how I want to start my morning. It's super loud and there appears to be nop way to fix it."
2,Good for iPods... VERY BAD for an alarm clock,"WARNING... if you use the alarm feature of this product it has a very bad bug.They advertise this as having a ""gradual"" wake up. Sort of. When your alarm goes off, the volume starts off very low... and then rises.The problem is, that it rises to the very loudest setting, with no way to change that. So within moments of the alarm going off, you have screamingly loud music or radio jolting you out of bed. It does not simply rise to the last volume setting you left it on. It goes all the way to the top.I called the company and they say ""that's the way it was designed"".BAD DESIGN.Had I known, I likely would not have purchased."
2,"Product good, but TOO BRIGHT","The iHome works great & has great functionality... however the LCD display is SO BRIGHT it lights up your room at night. I purchased the iHome to replace my clock radio & my Altec Lansing speakers which I use w/ my iPod. I figured it would be less clutter on my nightstand. The LCD is so bright on this thing it kept me up for over 3 nights. If you are using it as a clock/radio/alarm clock replacement you may want to think again. It has three settings to dim the LCD, but it just didn't go dark enough. It just literally shines a blue light in your face. I'm returning it based solely on this, nothing else. So if you don't think the light will bother you, or you are using it somewhere other than a nightstand this is probably the product for you!"
1,big as a cinder block and about as useful,"I have had this thing for about a year and a half. The ipod connection crapped out about a week after warranty expired. The company has an after warranty repair/replacement policy set up that costs almost as much as the unit itself. It is now a glorified clock radio that takes up too much space on my nightstand. When I was able to connect the ipod to the unit, the ipod sits on top of the radio and is very susceptible to being knocked off when reaching over to turn off the alarm or something else especially at night or in the morning when you aren't really awake. The only good features are the dimmable display and the switch on the back that lets you instantly adjust the time +1 or -1 hour. Otherwise, the sound is below average and the reception from the radio is poor and it is takes up way too much space."
2,unimpressed,"Ok...it functions well as a clock radio. Just fine. Reliable. But that's not too much to expect. Yes, it will charge your iPod and it does have the nifty function of an alarm that gradually (though not gradual enough) gets louder. The adaptor for my Nano fit fine; and I didn't find the clock too bright (it has 3 settings). But the sound is really terrible. It sounds like its coming from a transistor radio.As well, it advertises that you will be able to go to sleep and wake up with your iPod. But as we know, you don't need a clock radio to do that--your iPod will do that on its own if you set it.I took this back after 5 days and hooked up some cheap computer speakers with a volume control. They really sound better--I swear."
1,Not that great.,"I got my first ihome for christmas of last year. I didn't have it for more than a month before the connecter malfunctioned and went from distorting all the music played to completely stopping the sound completely. I figured it was just a defective unit. So I returned it and got another one. I shouldn't have. Now the ""new"" one is doing the same thing. I has stopped playing music completely. I am not happy with this product. I won't be replacing this one with another ihome. If anyone has any suggestions on a better product please let me know..."
3,"Decent, works with iPod Touch","Okay, there are some good things about this product, and it works with my iPod Touch, which is great, but ...what were they thinking with the button layout? The middle row of buttons, behind the snooze alarm, is a set of buttons that you rarely want to use, and which are easy to press by accident.In particular, the button on the left, which toggles between which alarms are set (none, iPod alarm, radio alarm, or both) is right in front of the button that plays iPod tracks. So twice already I've accidentally toggled my alarm clock from both alarms being set to no alarm being set when all I wanted to do was play the iPod music. Really bad design.It should be a basic rule of alarm clock design that it is difficult to change the alarm clock setting by accident."
1,gentle wake....right,Unless you like waking up angry or to loud music.The thing goes from a nice low gentle level to a crazy loud disturbing level in seconds. You need to instantly jump up and turn the dang thing off unless you like really loud music to wake up to. Whoever designed this stupid feature that cannot be turned off should be fired.
2,broke after a few months,I got this recently and it was awesome then...the dock piece became loose and i can't play my ipod on it anymore...so now it's pointless. :(
3,"OK, but not great","The good: Looks nice, easy to use.The bad: Sound is terrible (very boomy). Can't turn bass down. Radio reception is very poor. Too bright as a clock radio. No radio presets so you are manually searching for stations all the time.Bottom line: I like my IM3. I would recommend one of those along with a cheap clock radio."
1,Dysfunctional--don't buy it!!!,"I have a name for my I-Home, and that name is Satan.After three months of working fine, except for the alarm that almost gave me a heart attack every morning and the light that was like a car with its headlights pointed right in my bedroom window, my I-Home (Satan) has completely stopped working. It skips like crazy, from song to song, like a cd player being repeatedly banged against a hard surface. The radio skips as well. Now I refuse to put my IPOD in it at all, looking at some of the other horror stories I've read on these reviews. Nothing happened to the I-Home--I didn't drop it, spill anything on it, anything--it just suddenly felt the need to start acting like the alarm clock/music player from hell.Don't pay big bucks for this hellish product that doesn't work. Instead, just get a regular alarm clock and some speakers for your IPOD--you'll be glad you did."
2,Package Contents Misleading,"The outside box package contents states ""4 dock inserts to fit all ipods"". That is incorrect. I found out that you have to go to their web site ihomeaudio.com and order (yes that means PAY for) the IPOD NANO insert. Numerous emails to their customer service have gone unanswered. I havn't even used it yet but I think I will take it back due to this fact. Many more choices out there."
4,Perfect for work,"I like my ih5. The sound is decent for the size of the speakers. They have chambers, to help amplify it,and increase the bass. Anyone expecting big bass is unrealistic. I bought this for work, as people were complaining about the bass from my sub/sat system. The dials are inset, so not as easy to turn, but will probably last a really long time. If you want to wake to a specific song, just make sure and select it before you turn the ipod off. I found a way around having to pay extra for the remote. Get a 20% off coupon from BedBath, and Beyond, then you save 20$ on the unit, and just have to pay shipping for the remote. It only works up to 10 feet anyway."
4,It's ONLY a Clock Radio!,"People out there have to know that a cheap $100 clock radio isn't going to be perfect. Many people say the backlight is too bight, deal with it. If you don't put the iH5 right next to your head, it won't be so bright. Others say that the Reason 8 speakers don't have a good enough bass booster, IT'S ONLY A CLOCK RADIO!!! If you want descent bass booster buy a $100-$200 stereo system, don't expect this little clock radio to supply you with a deep bass. And still others say that the alarm is too loud. Isn't that the alarm's job, to wake you up. I don't care if the easy wake system dosen't work, I just want to get up. I like my iH5, and I will not be returning it. It does its job."
2,Too bright! Not for light sleepers!,"We have had ours for almost a year - it still works great, but there is one big problem - the display is a white/violet bright light. Great for visibility of the clock when you need it, but unfortunately, even when it's on the lowest setting, it lights up our whole room! My husband sleeps through it fine, but I need a dark room to fall asleep and I always have to throw a sweater or towel over it. We finally gave it up and switched back to our old clock radio."
4,good sound; stylish; buttons are a bit weird for my taste,"I wanted an audio option that would allow me to play my ipod (or radio) while in the bathroom and to clearly hear the audio over the water while I'm in the shower. This does the trick.I think the sound on this is great for its purpose. You can definitely hear it well. Like most players of this type, you are not buying this for the bass. So, don't except a rocking deep bass.Instead, you'll get a great player for a price well below $100 that will likely fit your needs.I do not understand why the volume button and the other button on the right (tuning?) are so large when the power buttons are so tiny. I would have preferred a better use of space to make all of the buttons more easily seen."
2,Don't buy this item!,"The machine looks nice and my iPod mini docked fine. However, the radio reception is bad - could not even recieve NPR without a hissing sound. A free radio that I got some years back had better FM reception! Furthermore, the speakers produce an audible humming noise when playing music on low volume. This got to be annoying very quickly. So shipped it back to Amazon who promptly refunded the amount. Checked on apple store and they do not stock this particular model. They only stock the iH6 - therefore ordered that one from Amazon. Will let you know how it works out...."
2,Doesn't keep time very well...,"I suppose I am being a bit harsh here, but I expect a CLOCK radio to keep time better than to lose a couple of minutes each month. All other aspects of this item work well, but why bother paying for the clock feature if you can't depend on it? Buttons on top stay lit (cool), and sound is good, but the a/c adapter plug is one of the largest ""bricks"" you will find these days. I ended up selling to get an atomic clock radio from Sangean. If you don't mind re-setting the time every month or so, go for it."
1,This product destoyed my ipod.,"I purchased the iHome for my daughter for Christmas. About one month later while plugging the 20 gig iPod into the docking port, the iPod started skipping from song to song playing about 1 second of each song (uncontrollably) before going to the next and had to be reset. About 3 days after that occurrence she plugged it in only to have it wipe out everything on it. Her iPod was just over 1 year old and out of warranty. The iPod will pass all self-test and diagnostics including the battery and hard drive but it is no longer recognized by iTunes or iPod restore software.An iPod is too big of an investment to risk on this product."
1,Very bad product for bedroom alarm clock - It's probably OK if you just want a iPod player in an office or other room.,"1. The display, even on the lowest setting, is too bright. Why didn't they provide a ""no light"" setting?2. Can't adjust alarm volume (for iPod or radio). Why didn't they just use the volume that you set the night before?3. The volume and tune controls are hard to use - they tried to make it like the Apple Click Wheel and failed.4. No remote control - what a joke! You really need it if you don't have it right next to your bed (because you have to turn the alarm volume down right after it goes off)."
1,Don't waste your money on this one,"The sound quality is poor and we can never listen to the radio without static. You have to hit the buttons twice to turn it off or on. Needless to say, we don't use it any more. Instead we bought [[ ASIN: B000OFSN4G Altec Lansing inMotion iM600 ]] which isn't an alarm system but you can set an alarm with the iPod and whose sound quality is excellent."
1,Absolutely not an acceptable clock radio,"A clock radio that does not allow you to set the wake volume is fatally flawed. I have read some comments that claim you can set the wake volume. If this is true, please let let the world know how it can be done. I have read the ""manual"" several times and tried everything. (you can set the ""sleep volume"", but that is a different function) It is hard to believe that a product could ever go to market with such a blatant design flaw. Even the crappiest 70's clock radio bought from Goodwill will have a volume control that sets the wake volume."
2,Can't Set the Wake-up Volume - Very disappointing,"I just got off the phone with iHome customer service. I called because when the iHome alarm comes on in the morning, it's very loud no matter where I set the volume before going to sleep. iHome Customer service says that's the way the unit is manufactured. You cannot set the wakeup volume where you want it. The fact that it comes on gradually is no consolation when it continues up to a ridiculously loud volume. Secondly, as other reviewers have said, the backlight on the unit is too bright, even on the lowest setting. Thirdly, a really loud beep occurs when you change the alarm settings, so if you're partner is asleep when you change the wakeup time, they'll be awake shortly. It's like a smoke detector going off. The iPod alarm clock is a great idea, but the basic functions of this unit are really a problem. Don't waste your money."
4,A good value,"It's important to remember that you get what you pay for. The sound quality isn't like a big stereo system, and it's true that the dim setting isn't dim enough. On the other hand you get a machine that has a good radio and alarm system and a way to dock, charge, and listen to your iPod for under a hundred bucks. It's small enough to fit on even very small bedside tables and the controls are easy to see in the dark. It's a very good value for the money."
4,It works . . .,"Have been looking for something that will play and CHARGE my older iPod classic 3rd Gen. According to iHome, this is the only model out there. With Firewire disappearing, using the cable was becoming more difficult. Actually ended up losing it, but new Macs have dropped the port anyway. So I took a chance and purchased it through the marketplace. It works! What else could I ask for?"
4,Great Product - 1 Complaint,I really enjoy this alarm clock / iPod speaker system. My only complaint is that you cannot turn off the backlighting of the push buttons on top.
4,"Great radio, good design, excellent price","Very pleased with design and features. The backlit buttons and illuminated display are great. I would hesitate to equate audio quality with that of a Tivoli or Bose radio, but for my needs, the sound is perfectly fine. Easy to operate, and looks great. I recommend this radio to anyone looking for a) an upgrade of their existing clock radio, and b) a simple way to integrate your ipod with external speakers."
5,iHome Essentials,Bought one for the office and have decided I needed one at home also. An essential for true iPod advocates who want their music everywhere!
2,Not Worth It,"Maybe i got a dud, but My iH5 isnt what I was expecting.I expected that when alarm went off, the volume would slowly fade up to gently wake me. Not so. The volume ramps up very quickly, so that its basically like the thing just comes on full volume.I expected that the snooze feature would work well. It doesn't. When the alarm initially goes off, Ipod plays just fine. After the first snooze, the buzzer goes off. After the next snooze, the Ipod will play again, after the next, the buzzer goes off, etc. How annoying.I expected the manual and the buttons to be fairly intuitive. They aren't."
2,bummed,The iHome I purchased for my daughter for Christmas doesn't work. No sound comes out when it is on.Will check into the matter more and return.
2,Not the greatest,I purchased this item to play my ipod at work. The sound isn't great and the volume is hard to adjust- it's either too loud or too quiet. I'm currently searching for something that won't disrupt my co-workers.
1,alarm unusable,"Like others, I've had to return the iHome. It has a ""Gentle Waking"" feature that raises the volume on wakeup to the maximum within about 3 seconds. The feature cannot be disabled or controlled. Our manual has a line that says, ""Make sure to adjust the volume level for comfortable wake up volume [sic]."" We called technical support and this was a misprint: you cannot control wake-up volume. It's a pity because this product could have been terrific."
2,A Very Basic radio with Limited Compatibilities & poor ergonomics,"This is a VERY basic radio: no presets for stations and limited compatibility that you will only read about in the user manual. And, the firmware can not be updated.I also have a very difficult time using the set-top dials as they are slippery and wobble.In my final analysis, this radio is way over priced for the basic functionality and the ergonomics are weak.I used a 5th Gen Video iPod (60 GB) and the radio seems to lock up the iPod at least once a month.I am disappointed with this product!"
1,overpriced and easily broken,"I was given an iHome as a Christmas gift. I was pleased with it overall but the extremely bright light, not-so-gradual wake up, and no way to set the wake volume or the song you wake up to were huge annoyances. I got used to it eventually. About 4 months after having used it, i took my iPod off one day to find the connector loose and my iPod not charged at all. It had completely broken off. I have always been extra careful to not move the iPod while on the dock and to take it off gently, and it still broke. All in all, this product has far more cons than pros, and needs to go back to the drawing board.Soon after my iHome broke, I bought an iBlaster from Bed Bath and Beyond. So far, it works much better. It's a sturdier construction, you can turn the light off, and is generally easier to use. It also cost 20 dollars less than the iHome and includes a remote. It still has no way to set the wake volume though."
3,Consider the newer alternatives,"While this might still be a good bet for you, and filled a need over a year ago when it came out ... there are newer alternatives you should consider. For example, the Memorex iWake costs less, is smaller, includes a remote, and looks better - and works well, with a few small areas with room for improvement that aren't a problem to me. Look below (under ""News and Reviews About This Product"") or do a web search for ilounge's reviews of the products and see how it would work for your needs.I've been wanting a compact, usable clock radio for my iPod for years, it's amazing no one seems to have really worked the bugs out yet. But the newest models are close enough - it's great to have everything on your iPod easily accessible in the morning and the evening."
2,Whats wrong with this,"Iv had two iHomes. I took the other one back because it stopped working, the light just kept on jolting on and off and thats pretty much all it did. I thought it might be bacause of the addaptor but now i'v got a new one its making wierd smells when i turn it on. Quite frightening actually. I dont really know what to do, it doesnt even look that good. It makes annoying noises which really arent helpfull when your trying to sleep, and thats normally! I wouldnt buy this. Really, its worth getting some bose speakers instead, then atleast you wont break your ipod too. Another annoying thing is that mine didnt come with a remote, like many others, i would have been less irritated if it had. The thing is i cant really take it back because its a present, so annoying. I guess ill jsust have to live with it, or secretly chuck it, it really isnt worth the hassle if its going to gas you over night."
2,wish it worked with 3rd generation...,"After tons of research and buying the wrong iHome product (iH6), I now have an iH5 which is supposed to work with a 3rd generation iPod and does not. So now I have a very expensive alarm clock and a dock for my iPod. Having contacted the seller and gotten several infuriatingly insulting emails from them, I give up! I wish I'd saved my money instead."
1,Conked out after a year.,Everything just stopped working. This is a low-quality product and not worth the money. I should also add that the light showing the time is so bright that it illuminates the entire room. We had to put a sock over the front of it before going to sleep. There is no adjustment for the light. There must be better quality items on the market by now. Skip this one.
2,DO NOT BUY- FATAL FLAW IN ALARM,"Generally this unit is OK, but you cannot set the volume level of your IPod when using it as an alarm! It comes on at mid level, WAY TO LOUD for my tender waking moments. The first morning I jumped 3 feet when my music came on. The ""Fade Up"" feature on the music just faded it in in 3 seconds, you get blasted pretty much right away. I think if you are going to make an alarm clock radio you should be able to get the basic feature of waking people up RIGHT!! I will be returning this foolish thing."
2,"Great idea, but poor follow-through","The iHome iH5 Clock Radio is a great concept and boasts some good features, but has two very important downfalls:One, the display is way too bright, even when set on the lowest level. It has an ""indiglo"" luminescent background displaying the time, etc. in black characters. I don't know why, but it is disturbing to sleep with. I had to cover it up at night, which defeats the purpose of a clock in your bedroom.Two, the volume of the iPod and radio alarm settings is too loud. It claims to ""lull you out of sleep"" by increasing the volume ""gradually"", but by that they mean from 0 to 60 in 5 seconds, and there is no discernable way to adjust the setting. Needless to say, it is not fun to wake up to, even if it is your favorite song.Anyway, I should have just bought a speaker cradle for my iPod, because I went back to the 15-year-old clock/radio my grandmother gave me when I was 14."
1,complete piece of junk,"what a disappointment and waste of money this turned out to be. i don't understand how/why everyone else's plays their music so crisp and clear, because mine certainly doesn't. yes, the alarm clock has nice features but the bottom line is that if it doesn't play my ipod music clearly -what's the point? it has never been dropped or mishandled so i don't understand what the problem is."
3,the happiest little girl,I Purchased the Ihome at an apple dealer for 25 dollars more than i should have <125.99> but whatever you wont do that will you?Anyway the ihome has very good instructions for setting it up< i have problems with technoligy > and boy ill tell you it Will wake you up as a alarm clock <witch is awesome > thats what matters right? sound is really good as well. so while i cant really complain about the price i will tell you that it has giving me what i was looking for.
3,Good functionality but light TOO Bright!!!!!,Overall I am happy with my iHome iH5 system my husband got me for christsmas. My only complaint with the product is the light on the screen is WAY too bright even on the lowest setting.I debated on returning the item but my husband is going to go to a local car shop to buy the stuff you put on windows to get them tinted and were going to try putting it over the screen. I thought that was a pretty good idea.If sleeping in the light is not a bother to you I think this would be a 4 to 5 star product.
2,"Easy to use, great to listen to","it has a great design, was easy to put together and works like a charm"
3,decent,awsome price good product but doesn't charge Ipod Touch. If you have a shell for your Ipod and dont want to take it off every time you use your Ihome you will have to connect it with a wire that is provided.
1,DO NOT BUY THIS ITEM,"DO NOT BUY THIS ITEM. The radio gets horrible reception -- always fuzzy. The sound from the iPod is iffy, very thin, and not very rich. After a couple of months, the buttons start to stick and you practically have to hammer them in order to get them to work.And the biggest kicker is the the clock doesn't keep time. That's right: every month it loses about ten minutes and we have to reset it.If the company can't even make a clock that works right, do you really trust them to make speakers right?"
1,Do not work with ipod nano!,I bought this radio and it do not work withIpod nano 4gb. I am very desappointed.Thank you.
3,Loved it until....,"I LOVED my ihome before one day it just stopped working. I've had it for almost 2 years when I noticed that the remote control wouldn't work. Upon further inspection I found the radio was also no longer working. And with my ipod plugged in, none of the controls built in worked so I had to control the music via the ipod itself. So basically now it functions just as a clock....boo!!! pretty expensive clock!!! looking into other options now..."
1,"High hopes, but woefully disappointed","I bought this thinking it would be great to wake up to the music of my choosing. While it is compatible with my IPOD, there were a couple of big flaws causing me to regret my purchase. First, the volume that the alarm is set on is set incredibly high. So unless you like to be blasted out of bed in the morning, it is incredibly unpleasant. Second, the backlight for the clock/date...etc. is super bright. On it's brightest setting, I can read to it. On it's lowest setting, it just keeps me up all night. I've had to throw a sheer cloth over to dim the light enough for me to sleep,...though it's still pretty bright....and annoying."
2,Breaks down after a year and a half,I came to these reviews to see if anyone had the problem I did. Namely that the setting and volume wheels no longer had any effect. Can't set the clock or reset the alarm -- which was the reason I bought the product.I wondered if I had just gotten a weak unit. I see from the many similar posts that the product was badly made. I won't be buying another.
2,Can anyone sleep with this back lit clock?,Does anybody remember the Seinfeld episode when Kramer couldn't sleep for the Kenny Rogers Roasted chicken sign out his window? The backlit clock design reminds me of this episode. The sound is great on this but my wife don't think the ipod set up is worth the really bad alarm clock design.
1,Sucky radio alarm clock...,This thing is flimsy and broke down and would not work after just one year. If you like getting hosed by one you will be delighted...
4,iHome for your Home.,"This is the perfect alarm for your room. It's loud, it's proud and it comes in 2 shades; black and white. The only down side is that the remote does not work very well and the spinning dials are a bit annoying. Besides that, it's a fantastic product and I would recommend it as a gift for any music aficionado."
5,works well,the radio is great but i ordered the remote at the sametime yet i didn't receive it till a week later.
2,Worked for awhile,I bought this product 2 years ago and I was very disappointed. The charger stopped working after 1 year and the sound system was very distorted whenever I used the ipod.
4,Good radio,I bought this for my daughter and she loves it. She listens to her ipod and uses it as a alarm clock. It is not a expensive high quality sounding stereo system but what do you expect from a alarm clock.
1,Worked well until knobs stopped functioning,I loved this radio for the first year of ownership until the knobs stopped working. I see others are having the same problem and it's really dissapointing. When you try to use the knobs to adjust something like volume or set the time the numbers just seem to randomly go up and down for every click.This is a very strange error and because both knobs quit at the same time it makes me believe that the problem was not caused by faulty knobs but instead something more fundamental to the unit failing like the firmware.I wouldn't be surprised to see a class action lawsuit if as many people's units are failing the way mine did.
3,Clock display too bright to sleep next too,"Overall, this is a great product, but it's a bit big for a clock radio on my nightside table and the clock display is way too bright to sleep near, even though it has a dimmer setting, it's like sleeping next to a night light."
4,Cool - but display is WAY too bright for bedroom,"Even on its dimmest setting, this is very bright so it's not at home in a bedroom. Too bad there isn't a way to turn off the backlight. Else, it's a great gadget. I plugged computer speakers and found the sound pretty good."
4,My I-Home,I like the black color. It was easy to set-up. The directions were good. The sound quality is good. I like that I can move it from room to room and not have to reset the clock.
2,IHome sucks,"An interesting device that does a nice job of integrating the iPod with a radio appliance. That's where the good abruptly ends. Their customer service is AWOL if you try to get any communications started. The radio tuner is lame, especially on the AM side, and the gentle wake feature climbs to volume 19 in about 15 seconds. It's enough to cause cardiac arrest for the dead. When asked about these ""features"" they have a standard set of canned responses on their website.(you'll be lucky to actually communicate with anyone). If all you want is a device to play your iPod loud, purchase something else. If you want something to integrate your iPod into a clock radio, avoid this device."
2,"After a year, it has turned into a static machine","The thing worked great as noted in the other reviews, but as it passed the one year mark, it is almost impossible to play it without annoying static coming out of at least one of the speakers. The ipod has to be held by hand to get it into a position without static. This happens on both my ipod and I am using the correct adapter. The connectors on both ipods are fine.. It's the ihome with a crappy dock connector"
2,Broke after 5 months,"I used my ihome alarm to wake me up for school, then over the summer I used it to play music and wake me up sometimes. Now I need it for school again and the piece of junk doesnt work anymore. None of the buttones work and it doesnt play any music or respond in any way!"
5,Home ipod radio,Works very well using IPOD or radio. Great alarm. Great sound. I would purchase again or similar product.
2,stay away,"This unit has numerous faults, the main ones are:#1 - The radio reception is atrocious.#2 - The sound is weak; the bass is bad, but perhaps OK for a unit this small. (They seem to have sacrificed high end response to get what little bass they could out of this thing.)#3 - The display is much too bright even at lowest setting. You can't turn it towards you as you sleep."
1,Temporary device,"I would only recommend this product if you need something that only lasts six months. There is a reason the warranty is only 90 days. The performance (sound quality) steadily declines over time. The ihome worked great when it was new, but it won't play songs from the ipod anymore, and the radio is a static box."
2,"Nice features, but fair quality at best","The features are nice, such as: light dimmer for clock, sleep mode, snooze, am/fm radio. The sound from the speakers is subobtimal. What the clock radios of the old days sound like. The worst part is the docking station. It worked great for the first year. With time the insert became loose and the iPod stopped charging and the sound from the iPod was akin to the radio not being quite on the right station. Putting cardboard between the iPod and dock helped, but just the wrong move and it was back to it's old tricks. I would not buy this again."
3,Improved:,"The beauty of it is that I can go to sleep to my tunes, but wake up to the weather report and any breaking news on the radio. Also I can create playlists on the iPod specifically for ""entertaining"" and have them right at my fingertips without having to fumble with CDs looking for the right one for the mood. I do have gripes; the backlight is too bright at night even at the lowest setting. I may be able to get used to it with time. Also, mine comes on a little louder than I think it should, but it isn't as loud as what the other reviewers stated, so that is an improvement and I may be able to adjust it - I'll have to experiment with it. As for the in-line AM antenna connector that was griped about, that has been fixed."
1,unfortunate design flaw,"If you enjoy waking to a BLASTING radio you'll love this unit. Alarm volume goes from 0-20 in about 10 seconds, 20 is full blast and it's not adjustable! What a ridiculus design flaw on an otherwise nice concept!"
1,Another sad example of design blind spots.,"I know this has been covered in other reviews, but I'm currently fuming enough to reiterate these points:1. The backlight on the clock display assures that you will not only be awoken by this clock, you actually will never get to sleep! Isn't there some torture technique that uses bright lights?2. The un-customizable wake volume is such that when I was sleeping in a completely different bedroom from where the unit is, I woke up thinking someone was in my front yard with a megaphone.Granted, the concept of this unit is innovative and points at an as-yet-served market need, but the execution is yet another example of sloppy design. Did they even try it themselves???!!!I just returned my unit and will hope that iHome has spurred better designers to enter this category."
4,Review of ihome ih5,"I bought this as a gift for my 13 year old niece, so I can't really rate it for myself, but she says she loves it - works great, etc. Anyway, you certainly can't beat the price on Amazon. I'm giving it a 4, versus a 5 becaue it is an older version and supposedly the new model is much improved, though more expensive."
5,radio review,"I gave the product to my grandaughter for her birthday. She says it great and works real well. Neet, as she put it. Everything was as expected."
2,"Great sound, but beware of control quality","I have had this item for about 6 months. The sound, and features are great, but the overall quality of the controls are very lacking to say the least. The only control that I really use is the volume control. After the first 4 months I noticed that it was becoming increasing difficult to control the volume. Seeing that it is digital, the volume would suddenly go from say 10 to 35 in one movement. If I attempted to adjust the volume down, it would continue to increase. The quality of the servo is very poor. Other than suddenly blowing out your other office workers ear drums, it is great."
2,Can't play iPod - arrrgh!,"After about one year the button that activates the iPod went dead, all the other buttons work. The only way to get the iPod to play is to set the alarm and set the iPod as the waker-upper. Arrrrgh! Warning: iHome products seem to be unreliable when you look at the numerous reviews of similar iHome junk."
2,"Great Features, Unreliable Connections","I like the features. I'm satisfied with the sound. The user interface could be more intuitive.HOWEVER, my overriding complaint is that the docking port (as many other reviewers have mentioned) is not reliable. The connection is poorly constructed, so just walking by the table on which it sits is often enough to make it think the iPod isn't there any more. If they could fix this quality problem, it would be well worth the $100, but since it is very hard to get it to recognize the connection reliably you just can't justify it at any price."
1,Do NOT buy this!,"My sister and I both received iHomes for Christmas. I was very happy UNTIL, after 5 months of regular use, my speakers stopped working with the iPod. The speakers became filled with STATIC and the music was virtually impossible to hear. The speakers had not completely broken, as the iHome radio still worked fine, but the sound quality while playing both my ipod and my sister's iPods on my iHome was ruined. Now, 3 months later (8 months total after buying the iHomes), the sound quality on my sister's iHome is becoming increasingly static-filled. We cannot hear our music over the static.In short, this product is A WASTE OF MONEY. Buy something else!!"
1,Bad Design and Overpriced,"I bought this for my kid for Christmas. What a mistake that was. The functionality as a clock radio is below average. Pair it with the Ipod and it is dismal. No remote included, when you need one to make the Ipod function in the docking cradle. If I could give this product a big fat ZERO, I would. This was way overpriced for what you get, and to not include that remote in the price is shameful. The nighttime display is so bright, I can see it lighting up the hallway 15 feet from my kid's bedroom all the way into my bedroom. Oh well, I don't have to worry about her sleeping in the dark. Now if I could just get to sleep."
3,Way too bright,"I concur with just about everything said below here. Its a very cool unit and works as advertised.However, the display is incredibly bright, even at the lowest setting and is like having a nightlight. Pretty obnoxious and very disappointing. There's no way I can use it as an alarm clock."
2,Great for the 1st 11 months,"I absolutely loved the iH5 clock radio for the 1st 11 months. Aside from the constant hassle of trying to get my ipod video to properly fit into the docking station; I was very happy with my purchase. Eleven months later my problems began: the clock constantly resets, often a factor in me being late because I do not have the correct time and the ipod will often stop playing after a few minutes. I called ihome for customer support and they replied by stating that the product is not guaranteed to work beyond the 90-day warranty. If I wanted it fixed I needed to send it to El Paso and it would cost me at least $40. Since $40 is half the purchase price of the unit, I am on the hunt for a more reliable unit."
1,Highly disappointing,"I was excited to get this to listen to my tunes as I get up, but as several others have mentioned, the tunes blast on at a volume setting of 20. Even though the directions say it can be adjusted, I can't seem to figure it out.The second problem is that I have set the alarm to the iPod setting and the beeper goes off and then later the iPod. I have tried to disengage the alarm and then reset it and the same thing happens.The third problem is that it frequently knocks the iPod of the ""shuffle songs"" mode.Many reviewers said that there was no remote, mine came with one and I don't actually use it much.Don't purchase, wait for a better model!!!"
4,good product,"The ih5 clock radio has been great. Everything was included (except the remote) and it was easy to set up and use. Allows my daughter to use her ipod in her room as a stereo, pretty inexpensive, considering. Recommended if you don't need ""the best"" but a great option for the price."
3,"Good product, minor nits","I like this unit fairly well. The first-generation product had an issue with the display being too bright; this has been corrected in recent units and allows for 3 levels of brightness (the last being almost completely dark.)The only problem I have currently is that I recently upgraded from an iPod Photo to a new iPod with Video, and for some reason docking this unit frequently causes the iHome clock to reset, for reasons unknown."
2,Not what I expected,Based on other reviews I went ahead and purchased the iHome iH5 Clock Radio and was not impressed to say the least. I didn't think the sound was that great and there was no bass. Ended up returning it and for $199 got the Klipsch IFI which is worlds better. I am very satisfied with the Klipsch.
5,Pleasantly Surprised,"I Must say I am Pleasantly Surprised with this Product. After reading some of the reviews on here I was Hesitant to Make this Purchase, But after seeing it on Sale for $75 I figured what the Hey. I recieved My ihome 3 days after ordering it using Super saver shipping and immediately Plugged it in.First, Let me say That The Sound is Awesome for such a Small Unit, I hear absolutely NO Static. There are Lots of different Docks even the Nano. I know some reviewers said the Nano Dock was Missing but I recieved one with Mine.Also the Remote is Included, So you don't have to spend an Additional $20 for the Purchase.I would highly recommend this Product, and if it's still on Sale for $75 when your reading this don't hesitate to Buy Now, You won't be disappointed."
4,"Nice Radio, Nice sound","Works well, provides a nice full-bodied sound quality to both radio and iPod. We just have the old shuffle, and it is a bit of a pain that the iHome doesn't charge the iPod, but it's better than the 5.99 speakers we got at the grocery store!We like the functionality of the clock too, the dimming function to the digital display is quite handy when the iHome is next to the bed.But when will they make a home audio device with a USB port so that we can play all the music we want without having to worry about the charge?"
2,Doesn't charge latest Ipod Nano!,"Great price and product in every way, except that it is not compatable with the latest generation Nano! It plays, but doesn't charge the ipod. That's a pain!!!"
5,Great Product!!,"This is a great speaker/alarm clock. I bought it for my ipod touch, [after reading in the reviews here that it works with it], and it works perfectly, the only problem is that it won't charge it. The speaker's sound is great, and the features for the alarm clock work really well. I just wish you could save the radio stations instead of having to look for them all the time [maybe I just havent figured out how to do it], and as others said it really lights out the whole room at night, I have to cover the front of it, but other than that, no major cons. Awesome product!!"
3,"OK, but could be improved as alarm clock","As some of the reviewers suggest, the IHome is OK but needs improvement in a few areas. I planned on using it as an alarm clock primarily, but even the most dimmed screen is too bright. Also, the snooze stops after 1 hour and some of the alarm functions could be better. The sound however is very good and I haven't had any issue with the Ipod attachment."
1,Franklin,"IPod will not function as alarm clock. Clock needs to returned which is a pain and disappointment. If purchased locally for the additional dollars, the cost would of been welcomed in light of the transport fees, inconvenience, iHome charge to correct ($10.00) and then time pending return of clock."
4,"Works great, but LED light is bright at night","I love the option of waking up to either the radio or my on tunes from my iPod, but the LED display is bright for those who prefer complete darkness when trying to fall asleep. Other than that, it's a great product."
4,Read the manual,Great product. I've read a lot of complaints about the display light being too bright. It clearly states in the users manual that pushing the snooze button (when not being used as an alarm clock) will dim or brighten the display.
3,Not Bad For The Price,I bought one of these for my office because I really didn't want a $400+ unit on my desk unsupervised at nights. The sound is pretty good for the dollars invested and it works well aesthetically. I had to replace my first one because the iPod connector malfunctioned and I didn't want to go through the hassle and expense of sending it back for repair. The second one I picked up is fine except that after a couple of weeks the volume control became temperamental. It will go from very soft to loud at just a touch of the control wheel. I just leave it set at one volume and the problem is solved. It could be argued that I could have had a pretty nice JBL or other brand name unit with the dollars that I paid for the original and replacement. Oh well.
3,Did not last,Purchased this for my son for xmas last year and it has already broken. Did not last 9 months. The clock set dial does not function properly and it is not possible to set the clock or the alarm. Warranty is up so I just purchased another ipod alarm clock by fisher to replace it.
2,iHome Clock Radio,"Very disappointing product. The power cord connection has a defect that results in radio losing power/not working. Amazon was very cooperative and replaced item twice, but both replacements also had problems. The first replacement was not exactly the same model as the original iH5, even though the box looked practically identical, and the second had the same power connection flaw. Finally asked for refund/credit on item."
1,Sure doesn't last long!,"I have had my IHome clock radio for about 2 years. Mine charges fine and it is nice to wake to my ipod, but it is such a pain to set the alarm clock. The dial on it quit working with in the first year I had it. You can turn the dial, but the time on the clock will go up or down, you never know. It is a major pain! I rarely change my alarm time b/c it drives me crazy. I called iHome and they said I could pay to send it back to them, pay them $40 to fix it, but they would pay to send it back to me. How generous!! NOT! Don't waste your money!"
1,Not Durable,"Sound is okay. Buttons are hard to reach while in bed and hard to identify by feel. They want $20 for a remote. My alarm worked for 11 days before dying, and I returned it. That made me shy of any iHome alarms."
1,Poor quality for too much money,"I liked the iHome when I got it. The sound quality was good. Changing the time was a little laborious with the wheel (that imitates the iPod wheel), but then again, those of us who have iPods are used to spinning, right? But less than 6 months after I purchased the iHome, the darn wheel to set the time and alarm stopped working. So basically, I have an expensive set of mediocre speakers with a clock. As long as the power doesn't go out, I guess I'm okay. But I'll have to be agreeable to waking up at 5:40 am from now on, I suppose.Bottom line: nice idea, poorly engineered."
1,one fatal flaw,"The main reason to buy this unit is as an alarm clock. If you want speakers for the ipod, there are many other options... so the only reason to consider this unit is if you want an alarm clock. And sadly, it fails. The volume on wakeup isn't adjustable - it is way too loud. I returned it."
1,Works as advertised - display too bright and alarm volume extremely loud,The product does everything it advertises and works well - except - the alarm volume is extremely loud on it's lowest setting and the display is far too bright on it's lowest setting. I have to place a book in front of the display and over each speaker to reduce the light and volume to reasonable levels. This unit would be ideal for a partially deaf and blind person.
2,I agree -- Design Flaws,"Pros:-->Decent sound for small unit. Crisp and clear, but a little short on the low end-->Cool look and integrates with ipod rather wellCons:-->Unable to adjust alarm volume of radio and ipod (not just buzzer). Always comes out as volume 20 or so. Very annoying and much too loud for me to stand. Even though the company brags about some gradual wake cycle, that volume has me jumping straight out of bed. I will be returning it based on this feature alone.-->Constant buzzing, static noise: minor, but it is there. Upsetting because the rest of the sound is great. But on quiet songs like classical music, is easily heard-->Too bright display -- as everyone else has said-->Click wheel sucks for changing alarm. If you want to change the alarm from your usual morning time, to the afternoon for an afternoon nap, it takes FOREVER. That clickwheel is annoying and slow to change.Summed up: Not worth the high price. Don't buy it."
1,IHOME DOES NOT WOrk WITH NEWER IPODS,"I bought this Ihome IH5 a few months agao when I had an old 3rd genreation IPOD. Well it was time for an upgrade and I just bought a new 8g NANO. Gues what, this machine does not work on any of the newer IPODS brought out in 2007!When I called to complain I was told, ""well we did not know Apple was bringing out new versions??? Come on that is just pure bunk!. So I asked so do I just throw out $99.00 and buy a different machine. The answer was well I cannot tell you what to do, but we are trying to test the new models and maybe you will have to download some software. I asked when and they said we do nnot know it will be a few months. So all the money I spent on this machine is totally wasted. DO NOT BUY THESE PRODUCTS, if you have a 2007 IPOD or planning on one for the holidays"
1,This is junk and it doesn't last 9 months,"I got this for Christmas last year. I hardly use the thing and when I have I have been very careful in placing the ipod on and off of it. I can no longer play an ipod on it as there is no sound or too much static - apparently a short of some sort. I was shocked as it had been used maybe 10 times by my wife and I. Read all of the reviews I am not the only one who now has an overpriced doorstop. Save your money and buy something else.Take your time and read through the ""cotton candy"" 4-5* reviews which bump this up to an artificially high rating of 3* and you will see one consistent pattern, the connection to the ipod is very poor, the alarm doesn't function, and they feel it is overpriced."
2,poor design options,"I concur with the previous reviewer regarding both the volume issue and the backlit display. The volume goes from mild, my personal preference, to FULL VOLUME in about 2 seconds. It's a race to the off button before it drives me insane every morning. Then, there is the backlit display. More light is not better. I currently have a shield over it at low setting just to get to sleep. This is not very condusive to actually telling time. I love the units form and function and the ipod integration, but these 2 ""features"" that are locked in are making me package it up and send it back."
1,Stopped working after 6 months,"Seriously, don't buy this.It worked perfectly for 6 months (warranty is only 90 days), but now it won't respond or charge the Ipod (apparently there is a short in the connecting part).Basically, it's a very overpriced clock radio."
2,Not Ready For the Big Leagues,"Great space-saving idea, but speakers are mediocre. Worse, the AM/FM reception is inferior. The FM ""antenna,"" if it can be called that, is a chord stuffed in the back of the radio. The AM is weaker than average.For now you're better off hooking up your iPod to a Tivoli Model One or Tivoli PAL."
3,poor sound,"I dido Scott Vaughn's review here. It is a really good looking system, the clock is great, one less thing on my night stand!!! The remote is great, the system would have been a home run if not for the sound quality and volume. It is bad!!! Frankly they dropped the ball on this one. Good sound is crital to keep a repeat customer here. Scot put it right on the money when he said it sounded like a transistor radio. (sad). Other than that everything else is great.Peggy"
2,Connector broke after 3 months of use,"The item has a defective connector. My daughter used it with her Nano but now the connector just rattles around on top of the unit. It slowly began to deteriorate after 2 months then finally broke completely. The adapter piece for the Nano does not fit it correctly and allows too much wiggle room. So when you go to change the song, etc. it bends the contacts on the connector. Now I have to return it with 30 bucks to get it fixed not to mention the shipping cost. Plus if the new design isn't better then I'm sure it will reoccur. My advice, unless it is redesigned do not buy it for the Nano."
4,iHome - great dock for iPod,The iHome system is very useful. We can now access our iPod and have speakers attached to hear it without earphones. The radio access is also great - using the remote which was sold separately. The only down side is that the time is unreadable in the dark and difficult to see even with the lights on.
3,Not bad,"I received this item as a xmas present. Overall, I am happy with it. I was looking for a mutli-functional unit that allowed me to play music in the bedroom while getting ready. The ihome does that. I'm very pleased with the sound quality, ease of use and I love that it charges my ipod. I have an ipod video and my unit did not come with an insert to fit it however, I called customer service and they promptly shipped one to me for free.The downfalls are as described. The alarm is pretty darn loud and the clock face acts as a night light (even at the lowest brightness setting). Neither of these 2 defects really bother me and I plan to keep it and use it."
1,Want to be woken up at full volume?,"Alarm always comes on at full volume ( IPod, Radio or Buzzer). There is no way to adjust this. I've called customer service but there is no way to change this. A normal play level would be a setting of ""4"" the alarm clock comes on at near ""20"". Very loud!If your neighbors like been woken up by your alarm clock, then this is the clock for you. Otherwise look somewhere else."
1,Damaged,"Unfortunately, I ordered this item as a present for my brother-in-law and when he opened it, the display on the ipod/radio doesn't work. He also threw away the packaging before he tried it out, so I can't return it to get credit back. Not happy."
5,Book,This book has been a go-to reference many times and I find it fascinating just to read. I use it alot.
3,What answers?,"As a religion teacher I flipped through this book and found it very weak on total truthfulness. The author fails to mention that Muhammad murdered caravan merchants to raise money for a army to kill more people; that in his opinion Christians set up the Church by reinterpreting the Bible; he fails to mention the numerous rules to be obeyed in Hinduism and Buddhism. His lack of accuracy continues through the descriptions of other religions as well. Not a very good ""Answer Book."""
5,Very funny and touching book!,"This is a very well told story of growing up different. I also loved his rememberances of being part of the 70's disco culture.Autobiographies live or die based on the ""tone"" and how much the writer shares with the reader. Here the tone is humorous and refreshing - the details are moving.This is a great book and deserves more attention. I have had my friends all read and love it. :)"
5,Very funny book,What I liked about this book is that it is a coming out story that doesn't get too heavy. Decaro definately went through some tough times but his attitude is refreshing. He does not dwell on negatives. Anyone can learn from that.
3,Worth it.,This cover keeps my car protected and the price was low. It's not fancy nor perfectly fitted to my MINI Convertable but I'm pleased.
2,Format wasn't reader friendly,"There was a lot of good advice in the book; however, I felt it was too jumbled up in the book. I lost interest in reading the book early on and just skimmed over sections. I wish the book had been laid out better."
2,"Ok, but does not work with caller ID",This product is OK but has one major drawback. You will not be able to use caller ID unless you rewire your whole house. The manufacturer claims that this product will work with caller ID but that is not true. Any phone signal that comes out of this product will not display caller ID. You will need to run a new set of wires to each phone location and connect that to your phone line BEFORE it enters the DR401 call manager. You then have to wire the other end to a seperate caller ID box by each phone. Hardly worth the effort in my opinion. If you don't need or care about caller ID this product works great! Otherwise take note of the above.
5,"Excellent, Easy and FUN!","The software is very easy to use. It does work best if you use a fountain pen. Ballpoint pens are not recommened. Felt tip pens can give you letters that are too large, or blurry, which will require a lot of etrxa time to edit after they are scanned. I've created a few different fonts very quickly. It does take a while to get it just right, but, it is very easy to fix the letters and characters to get them just the way you want them.One other thing. The box says that you need a flat-bed scanner. This may not be true for all circumstances. I have a sheet-fed scanner cartrige, (IS-32), for my Cannon s400 printer. The proof sheet scanned into the program, using the cartridge, just fine. I used the OCR setting in the scanner driver. Sending an e-mail attachment with the text in the personalized font was very easy. The whole thing works like a charm.I ran the program on a computer with a 1.2 G Celeron processor, running WIN XP with 256 RAM."
5,Rhapsody contiunes to dominate,"two words, BUY IT.there is not one excuse not to put this cd in your collection, holy thuderforce is easily the best song on this cd. the whole cd is amazing as well. not one bad song. even the vocaless songs are awesome."
1,sorry but i didnt purchase this product,"sorry but i didnt purchase this item, i canceled it because it was taking so long."
3,Good Footage,Good footage and nice fish. Great locations with character. I would recommend this to the fly addict who loves watching adventure type content. Dialogue is a little weak.
1,Nearly useless piece of garbage,"I bought this because my original battery had reached the point where it only lasted 36 hours and I figured I could cheapskate my way to December, when Verizon will give me a free phone. After lasting three days the first time I charged it up, this battery doesn't last 18 hours now, gently used. A total waste of $11, and my first bad experience at Amazon."
2,Low Endurance Battery,"This battery has a great price and the company makes a timely delivery. However, it does not last long without having to recharge. This battery is best used as a spare and not as your primary battery."
5,Great teaching,"The Guide is showing the Poomse from a few views and helps U to understand each move.Also, it is very easy to move with the guide because of the clean moves that he makes"
3,Mr & Mrs North volume 1 of 8 (Alpha Video),"Specifically regarding volume 1 (of 8) from Alpha Video. This single disc contains four episodes but they are not the first four episodes from the 1952-54 television series and Steve Kaplan, Alpha's owner, does not provide original episode titles except for the third episode which has an on-screen title card. The first episode (Nosed Out, season 1, episode 6) has the best picture quality and the other three are soft, slightly overexposed/thin contrast, and missing frames.Episode 2 is ""The Frightened Bride"" (season 1, eps. 22); episode 3 is ""Target"" (season 2, eps. 2); and episode 4 is ""The Third Eye"" (season 1, eps. 18). The Frightened Bride has a poorly written script from M. Coates Webster with major flaws.This is the first of eight volumes (discs) released by Alpha which are also available as an eight volume collection. It is the best price deal."
3,Go North!,"This'll date me: I used to watch Pam and Jerry North on black and white tv as a kid. So this is a bit of a nostalgia trip for me, and I may rate them higher than I should. But in my opinion, they definately stack up well against the likes of ""Monk"" (which I also mostly enjoy). The humor is a little corny. Pam is a Gracie Allen type ""screwy dame"", but the mysteries are ok, and you enjoy spending time with the people. It's hard to say better than that about any entertainment!"
3,DVD,Remember seeing the show as a child and was glad to be able to get the dvd. However it only had four 30 minute episodes and felt there should have been more on the dvd.
4,An interesting and varied collection!,"There are a lot of talented Alabama women writers! I like the cover of the book, too. Editor/Publisher Moran is to be congratulated on this collection."
5,This book is wonderful!,This book is filled with glimpses into the souls of women who are passionate about life. And they can put their feelings on the page and communicate to us what is innermost in their hearts. The stories will truly exhilirate you and the poetry is surpassed by none. I can't tell you how much I enjoyed reading this book!
4,Strong Sticks - Strong Story,"An excellent story, I would like to see it released as a feature-length film."
4,New Jersey Loves The Last Bad Decision,"There's so much controversy over this book/author. Why? I think it's brilliant that Paula Edwards takes a stab at a subject most of us run away from.Chancey is the main character dealing with adversity in his hood of Watts. He escapes once by going to Juvenile Hall, then again when he meets Tia.The thing I liked most about this book was how it went from scene to scene, finally all unraveling toward the end. It was cute, sad, funny, very unpredictable, and most of all a wake up call to black America.Overall, I gave this book 4 stars because of its creativity and well rounded characters. I could have done without the street slang, which made it hard to read at times.I definitely see a sequel stemming from the book from the way Rondell was left to run free after causing such havoc to so many people.RolandaNothing BUT Page Turners Book Club"
5,this was da bomb,this book didnt end the way i expected. chancey was all that and he didnt even know it. i felt sorry for him and i cried at the end but i also laughed too. get this book. its good as hell.
2,"WARNING: IF YOU READ THIS BOOK, START ON PG 15","I'm still trying to figure out what the hype was about this book. First, it was designed for a nonmature audience. I'm very grown and was disappointed to read about a seventeen year old. There was nothing different in this book than any other urban tale. I didn't like how the author told at the beginning what was going to happen at the end. That's why I put a warning to start on page 15, 3rd paragraph. You'll probably enjoy it more if you start from there and then go back to the beginning pages. There were too many unanswered questions at the end, but not enough to write a sequel. I do not recommend this book for mature audiences. This book should be in the young teen's section. I'll let my 15 year old read it and come back with her review."
3,Sometimes it's okay to judge a book by its cover.,"What you see is what you get. This novel was gripping. I hated the ending! I don't think Paula Edwards made a wise decision to end her novel this way. There are a lot of copycats in this world Miss Edwards. My favorite character was Chancey by far, but I also liked his sister Sechi and Kaylan's mother. I think reveiwers are giving way too much credit for a ending that was so tragic it should be banned from bookshelves. Fans of this author might hate me for my review, but be glad I didn't give the ending away. Overall, this book was worth the money. If black men don't wake up after reading this, they never will."
4,R*E*A*L S*H*I*!,This is A true depiction of life in the projects. Don't judge a hustla if you never walked in his shoes. This told it just the way it is.
3,Average,"This was good until the last chapter. The Ronnie character got off too easy for what he orchestrated with Stan to kill Tia (the young lady that Chancey, the main character is in love with). The author has Ronnie standing over Chancey's casket saying I wish I can change places with you. That didn't seem real to me when he was the reason Chancey was where he was. Or did I miss something? I would have to agree with the spotlight reviewer in that the book was written different from the normal format and that made it very interesting up until the last chapter. In the last chapter I was shaking my head NO. Better luck next time..."
4,Don't let this album be Unheard...,"Here's a cd that provides great mood for those early morning road trips, dinner during sunset and cocktails with friends. I first saw Pete perform live as an opener for Better Than Ezra. I bought the cd on a whim and have been thankful ever since.ONE TRAIN is a wonderful addition to any mix tape made for someone you have a crush on...STONES has a HOT HOT HOT bassline, that defines the entire mood of the song. Try NOT moving your head to this one.BENEATH THE FIRE-One of the most beautiful songs ever written for 9/11 exists on this album, and its sad that not many people have ever heard of it thus far. It explains the story of a Firefighter's Dad searching through the rumble of ground zero, searching for his boy's body, so that he may be properly laid to rest.This album is worth the purchase for this song alone.Pete's voice is definately equal to the dosage of a mood relaxor. I highly recommend this prescription for cool..."
5,Unbelievable,"This CD is absolutely amazing. It has so many different moods it reminds me of a motion picture. At first I was little skeptical about his solo project. I heard his first CD ""So they say"" and thought it was pretty good, but I still thought he and the other two members of Dispatch should have stayed together. I still do wish they were together, but Pete Francis' solo project is absolutely amazing. ""One Train"", ""Burning the River"", ""Untold"", and ""Beneath the Fire"" are my favorites. Put this CD together with the new Guster CD ""Keep it Together"" and either of the two Jack Johnson CDs and you have a perfect soundtrack for your own summer."
5,"Powerful, yet smooth","Pete's new album is amazing. It's quite different than his first CD, So They Say. Untold has powerful songs with mixes of acousitc, electric, saxaphone, organs, female vocals and more. Its definitely an album you would want to pick up for everyday listening. I would find it very hard to get tired of this CD, as it seems to mix in a little something new every time you listen to it. So, if you are a lover of dispatch, singer-songwriters, and in general, amazing music, definitely pick up and support Pete Francis. You wont be disapointed. This album is $...well spent."
2,"Good idea, but it's a bit hard","I've been wanting someone to make something like this for a long time for to stretch the sub occipitals at the back of my head, but this thing is a little hard and I haven't been able to figure out how to get it in the right position to make it work yet."
5,best tool for massing,this is a very useful tool to use on yourself or on your clients. sure does save on your hands and thumbs.m. phipps
3,Odd,"My son recommended this to me for shoulder pain. He said it would hurt. It did. Plus, instructions on how to use it were nil.However, I did position it under my shoulder, feeling a lot of pain at the source, and also radiating into my neck. Then after about 20 minutes, I felt a ""pop"" like something giving near my scapula. After that my shoulder was much better. So who knows?"
3,Not what I thought,"Very hard plastic, and I didn't really like the feel of this under my neck or shoulder."
2,So-so,"I found it only moderately good at what it's supposed to do. I think a tennis ball or other small rubber ball would work as well. I used it to put pressure on sore muscles between my shoulder blades. It seems as if it might be too large for me to position well (I'm a 5'5"" male). It's not really bad, but seems overpriced to me."
3,Its ok...Needs Instructions,"I've had it for a while now and I really don't use it too often, mostly due to the fact that I don't know how to. I bought items similar at the same time as this that I prefer for back pains and whatnot; such as, the ""spine-worx"" and the(backbody) trigger point therapy tools. I use those quite a bit and they work great. I tried incorporating the DaVinci into the therapy and I still haven't found great use of it. I have tried though. I'm not really sure if I would recommend this product, for the price its not too bad. I hope this helped."
2,Might be good in limited ways for some people??,"I'm not a super tall guy at 6' 215lbs, but even so i'd expect this to be more useful for my neck like laying on the floor watching TV or sitting on the couch with it wedged behind my neck but it's either too small and/or the design is lacking as it's not comfortable enough to stay in any position long enough to do any good. I think a person could find some niche in his back this would help as part of a 'toolbag' but for a piece of rubber, it's over-priced for what it does. And yes, it is pretty flimsy. Smaller women might find it more useful as it tends to bend out of place really easy on me. The whole premise for it is to sort of stretch out your tight spots or put your spine in a bit of traction but for me, it fails. Price it at $10 and i'd give it more stars."
2,Don't understand,"I don't quite understand what the deal is with this product. I could pull a similar sized toy out of my kid's toy closet and produce the same result. Perhaps I'm missing something, but this isn't one of my better purchases."
1,davinci NOT,"it's a blue rubber triangle that comes in a box with no instructions. every edge is different i suppose for a different use, but i don't know because there wasn't even a booklet to show it's purpose. doorstop?"
2,better products available than this,This is not a great product. I have and recomend Docter Riter's Real Ease neck support. It is a much better product for those with neck pain.
4,Divinci Tool,"This is a ""different"" tool to use but very effective. It is great for working out the knots in the muscles but it is hard to get use to. I use it against the wall for the upper back and scapula areas working in smal circles or up and down motions to work the trigger points. I tis great on the floor for the neck! Especially at the base of the skull. The directions say that it can be used to massage a partner but I don't like how it feels . I can't ""feel"" the muscles I am working. But it is good to massage my legs and glutes as long as there is oil to help with the friction. I to recommend it for anyone who needs to do self massage and trigger point pressure."
2,Soft?,There is nothing soft about the Davinci Tool. It is very awkward to use. Tried using it several times and did not like it at all.
2,I don't recommend this product,It was not a very helpful or convenient product. It's hard to put it under the right position where you pain is. It also lacks of flexibility.
2,not 'soft',"I had expected this to be 'soft' since that's how it's labeled and certainly softer than the 'firm' Davinci Tool. However, I can feel no real difference between the two and can find no place on my body where they help more than they hurt. Also, besides the fact that neither is soft, they are both too large for my body. There should be a choice in sizes. Wouldn't recommend."
5,Tremendous player and composer,"Jane Ira Bloom is an extremely talented soprano saxophonist and composer. This CD features her unique compositional ideas, her warm, rich, yet searching tone, her substantial technique and her ""less is more"" solo style.The CD succeeds in many ways: originality in composition, sound and solo ideas, including interesting use of electronic effects for her soprano and percussion; variety in the recordings which include trios up to sextets and a closing piece of solo soprano saxophone; her unique tone and solo ideas.My favorite cuts are the solo piece, ""Lost in the Stars"" and ""Most Distant Galaxy"", commissioned by Nasa, which features and ARCO (with bow) bass solo and in-and-out time.While this CD, by genre, is technically on the outside as opposed to mainstream, it is still very accessible.Her supporting players include such luminaries as Rufus Reid on bass and Kenny Werner on piano.This CD is wonderful and I couldn't recommend it more."
2,not the best,"I was expecting a lot more out of this game after I read all the reviews. The game is not adicting, I played it for a couple of days and then put it up on the shelve, a sure sign that I didn't enjoy it. Everyone's tastes are different and I guess I like more of the strategy and a lot more types of games within the games. I would not recommend this game."
4,Son Enjoys It,"My 13 year old son enjoys this game, however not as much as the ""war-type"" games. I'm sure that athletes appreciate this much more than non-athletes. Quality of product is good and delivery time was prompt."
5,Awesome Game!,"I ordered this game for my son's 8th birthday! He loves it!!! It is easy enough for him to play and yet gives him enough of a challege that it doesn't seem like what he would call a ""baby game."""
5,Exiciting and Dramatic!!!!!1,"Absolutely astonishing! Expresses the thoughts of a young boy in search for his best friend Scrub, (an old mistreated dog). Excellent book for the whole family."
3,Not quite a hit,"Fans of John McCain who want to know about the senator's life history will not be too disappointed. It's all there, from his childhood through his military service through his ascendancy to the national spotlight.Unfortunately, the book is sloppily written and edited. Alexander repeats himself quite often, and he relies too much on long-winded quotes from other sources. Further, the editing leaves a lot to be desired. Phrases like ""centered around,"" as opposed to the correct ""centered on"" are commonplace and distracting. Alexander's magazine pieces are much better, which leads me to believe this work suffers from poor editing more than the pedestrian prose."
5,This is my favorite appliance,"My mother-in-law got this for us a couple of years ago for Christmas. They have redesigned the feet, yet it is the same thing. I have grilled and used the skillet top and both have performed beautifully. It cleans up very easily and the surface is not only nicely non-stick, it also has held up to wear very well. If I had to go with out an appliance in the kitchen this would be the last one I would give up. My only minor complaint is that the manual was very unclear about whether or not to add water to the pan when using the skillet top. Buried on one of the pages, my suspision that we didn't need to use water was confirmed. Overall a great addition to any kitchen."
3,Go Propane,"This product works, but the heat doesn't get hot enough for real grilling. It is a nice design and the griddle plate offers even more versatility, but electric grills for all their promise of convenience are a pain to clean, especially if you try grilling something such as ribs.I've owned 4 different electric grills from George Foreman to this to large outdoor electrics (bad idea) to Cuisinart and none of them come close to propane or charcoal/wood. They are good for backup, some make ok Panini sandwiches, and they are useful for dorm rooms/apartments or a trip where you want to make breakfast or sandwiches or grilling some shrimp or something small, but for a home or apartment with a deck it is a bad idea to go electric, unless you rarely, rarely grill at all."
3,Griddle,The griddle is missing drain holes that are shown in the advertisements. Either I got a later model or somebody's lyin'
3,Watch what you buy,"Yes, my printer is old in computer-years but it still works like a champ. I ordered this toner cartridge from Blizzard LLC. The shipping was fast enough, but when I opened the box, it was obviously a re-filled cartridge. There was toner all over it, the interior bag wasn't sealed and the cardboard insert was torn while the exterior box was in perfect condition. After I cleaned all the loose toner off, I inserted it in my printer and it works.In the future, I will ask more questions about if it is a factory-sealed cartridge or a re-filled one. I'm disappointed that the web site didn't disclose this."
4,Epson Ink From Amazon,I think the ink is old and does not print as black as it should. But it is OK. The printer is discontinued.
2,Bah!,"This is a really mediocre book with even more mediocre line drawings and the layout is poor. The ""recipes"" are integrated in narrative style right into the same area of the book that contains botanical information about the plant. The book also contains useless information about what Native Americans did with the plant 150 years ago. Personally, I find it very hard to identify plants from simple, black and white drawings, particularly when said drawings are small and not very good, and most particularly when it is a plant I intend on eating! I am really sorry I purchased this book, but I purchased it together with another book called ""The Forager's Harvest"" by Samuel Thayer which is, by contrast, EXCELLENT."
3,A passable overview,This book lists a short description of most wild edibles. It has only passable drawn illustrations.
2,"Important history, poorly written","This is important reading. Unfortunately, the narration wasso poorly written it was hard to keep going. I regret that Icannot recommend this book."
5,Excellent book.,"I recommend this book to everyone. Read this book and find ways to forgive, overcome adversity and believe in faith. Keep up the good work in your community.Art"
3,"High Gossip, Academic Style","It's interesting to observe how dry academic language can take the juiciest gossip, the most outrageous of unfounded rumors, and the most gruesome tales of betrayal, debauchery, and degeneration and turn it into a tedious labor requiring considerable concentration just to keep track of the action.Weakened by unimaginative writing, this tome is primarily of interest for its wealth of genealogical detail. It includes stories of the popes from the tenth century to the nineteenth, but there has to be a more readable source for that material."
1,Baby Book,"The binding of the book was damaged upon arrival. However, the book itself is fun and my daughter loves it."
5,Satisfying Film Making is Not a Simple Affair,"Perhaps the title of this review adequately describes the film's content and emotional import. This brilliant and disturbing piece of cinematographic work by Peter Greenaway ranks among the very best attempts to open the human psyche to its own unfathomable depths.Harry Hughes, author of The Bait Shack"
2,"Highly abstract, bizarre study of life/death/decay","A visually striking film focusing on the zoological fascination that two brothers have on birth, life, death and decay. Not the meaning of life and death but the physical properties of existence and non-existence. Although there is some male and female frontal nudity in this film, there are no sex scenes as such. The dialogue vibrates between being witty and tedious. A slow moving film proceeding towards an inevitable conclusion. There are only a few people to whom I could recommend this film."
5,No chinks in this Armour. Simply MarEvelous!!!,"I read it a long time ago in India and loved Eve-ry bit of it. This is really a combination of Carry on Cleo, Eve-olution of woman in the best possible comic parlance and just wonderful, easy reading that captures your imagination and is too witty. Thank you Mr Armour for your Rich humour."
5,Gold U.S. Navy Seals Insignia Pin,"Gold U.S. Navy Seals Insignia Pin:This is a very handsome pin and is gold in color and has a very sturdy pin clasp to hold it firmly to what ever fabric you want to attach it to. It fits well on a mens suit or sport jacket lapel, the ladies can wear it on a jacket as well, or be creative. This pin is large enough to be seen and recognized and is heavy for its size, but not so large as to be out of place when worn.I've had several people ask about this pin and they all thought it to be well proportioned to my suit lapel, the construction is very detailed as the insignia shows well.I am very pleased with this pin. The Navy Seals are top notch and this pin is as well... 5 stars."
4,Remarkable vocalizing!,"I purchased this rather over-resonant recording for the glory of the singing of Peter Anders. His voice in the Strauss songs is truly heroic and of the caliber and nuance that is not heard today. Here is a glimpse of the kind of vocal delivery that Strauss expected in his orchestral songs - an interpretation that is passionate and urgent, not fussy or over- interpreted."
3,Not quite enough payoff for the time invested.,"A bit of ""Crash"" (and it's ilk). A bit of ""Pulp Fiction"". A bit too long, with not quite a big enough payoff for the time invested."
4,romantic book,I enjoy to read that fantastique book.it speak about the short life of the last Napoleon called l'Aiglon. It is written in a romantic way.You live a period of the French history throught the life of that young man whom destiny was to be emperor but who was to ill to become one.It is a sad book but very well done.You will remember that book for ever.
3,Are the facts right? There are many factual errors.,"I've just started reading this book and am finding factual errors as early as page 4. Mr Linedecker reports the popular, but untrue story of Cassie Bernall being shot after stating that she believes in god. (The real story has not been nearly so publicized - it was another girl who was asked and she was allowed to live). The bottom line is that I wonder if any of Mr. Linedecker's facts can be trusted, since only a few minutes of investigation are needed to dispell the aforementioned misstatement."
2,Do Not Bother,I was very dissappointed in this book. I think the author did not do his homework. Please get the facts straight before you tell the public what you think happened.
4,This is GREAT book!,I have read a lot of true crime books and this book is good for different stories of babyface killers in one.. I enjoy reading them and keep wondering why they have to kill at school.
3,Why does the author keep arguing with reviewers?,"Am I the only one who finds it worrying (and worrying on a number of levels) that the auther of this book feels the need to a) be the first to review his own book and, b) that the author argues with a review he finds less than flattering? Maybe just a little controlling, huh? Maybe just plain creepy. Maybe just unpleasant."
2,Old Wood?,"There's a myth going around that old 1960s Gretsch sets sound fantastic and are better than the new Gretsch 125th Anniversary bop and jazz kits because the wood in the older drums has aged. Well, now let's just think about this for about three seconds-- Those great sounding drums Tony Williams played with Miles were new Gretsch drums; they weren't 30 years old at the time. Personally I would rather shell out the bucks for a brand new Gretsch bop kit than get one from the 60s and probably have to pay nearly as much even IF I could find one at all, let alone one with a nice polished wood finish rather than red sparkle or black diamond pearl. Regarding the book, rather than spending $35 here I'd rather put the money in an envelope marked ""125th Anniversary Progressive Bop Kit."""
5,Unforgetably One of a Kind...,"Wendy Colonna is a ""one of a kind"" talent whose voice can only be described as rawly passionate and as real as true life. ""RED"" is her second album, the first being ""Girls of Stone"". Both albums display quite clearly Wendy's authentic folksy grooves, while also providing emotionally powerful songs of longing and yearning, such as ""Coffee Today"" and ""Wake Me"".After buying both of Wendy's albums, I find myself listening to them over and over again. And not just one song, mind you, but the entire albums.Give them a try. I guarentee you will not be disappointed."
4,"Great book for prayers, Bible passages, and more.","This book makes it easy to celebrate Lent at home through prayers and Bible readings. Includes easy-to-follow days of the week prayers and petitions. Also has stories for reflection. Includes a large section for kids to follow in the family's activities. Very practical and moving. I learned a lot of Lenten prayer practices that I was unaware of, some of the more old-fashioned ones."
3,"Great movie, poor video","This is a wonderful silent movie about the life of Napoleon. The video quality is very poor, but still worth watching."
1,No Renewal,"This was a Christmas present last year and when prompted, I replied I did not want to new the subscription. I hope it was cancelled. I wont be giving magazine subscriptions as gifts anymore, because I don't want to have to make sure it gets cancelled in one year!!Sincerely,Carol Winkler"
1,Still waiting for the first issue!,"I've been waiting over a month and have yeti to get the first issue. Although I'm eager for it, it's annoying to be asked to review a product I've yet to receive."
2,A lot of ads.,"This magazine is great for the pictures, but not the reading material. There are sooo many ads as well. I purchased the subscription for a year and, needless to say, I did not renew."
2,No substance.,"I'm in fashion business since 2011, and this magazine is not helping.You are not getting fashion trends, good pictures of trends, etc.Just boring long articles..."
2,Still havent received first issue,The first issue was estimated to be delivered amonth ago and I still haven't recieved it yet. Tried reporting it on the link in subscription manager and was informed by Hearst that the magazine had been sent... and still no issue!!!!Delivery service is horrible!
3,An ok fashion mag,"I gave this magazine only 3 stars for a few reasons. It does have its good points so I'll start with those first:- Excellent detail to trends and specifically accessories. A lot of other magazines only give these minimal amount of coverage.- Good coverage as far as fashion show lines and drawing trends from them.But that's as much as I can say. I don't subscribe to Elle anymore, but would reconsider if they improved the following:- Included more debuting designers.- Stopped or at least balanced the ultra-left leaning articles about social issues and politics.- Reduced the amount of ads and added more content.- Focused on fashion and style more and celebrities less.Overall 3 stars. I'll buy this if I'm stuck in an airport and have already looked through the other magazines. But that's the only time I look at it now."
4,I'd buy this before any other fashion magazine,"I happen to really enjoy Elle, I believe that they have an even balance between fashion trends, accessories, shoes, articles and interviews. I do wish they would place less celebrities on magazine covers and more models again, but it is nice to see your favorite singer or actress on a magazine, esp Gwen Stefani who is always gorgeous. The magazine does tend to lean more towards the left in terms of politics but thats fine with me, if that isn't your preference maybe another magazine would be better suited for you. That aside, I'd say that out of all the high fashion magazines Elle would rank right next to Harper's Bazaar but behind Vogue."
3,Used to better but still good,"I have subscribed to Elle for nearly 20 years and I have seen it change in recent years into more of a In Style type mag. There is increasing focus on celebrities, with one on every cover. I find this annoying--if I wanted to see Britney Spears or Posh Spice I would buy the Enquirer or People. I wish Elle would go back to featuring relatively unknown models instead of actresses. I think the recent change in leadership is causing the magazine to have an identity crisis. They can't really compete with Vogue but they're not sure who they should be...InStyle? People? Glamour?Despite the recent turmoil however, it's still a good magazine. I love the book recommendations, in-depth articles, and of course E.Jean."
1,Save the trees,This magazine is nothing more than a bunch of ads. There are very few stories put at the end of the magazine and the articles don't match the headlines on the front of the magazine. I only paid $5.00 for the entire year but I won't be renewing or recommending anyone else to purchase this product either. Don't waste any more trees to print this crap.
3,Okay I guess......,"If you are an Elle Fan than of course this is probably a good deal. I subscribed for a year, but didn't get much out of it. I prefer Instyle more. The articles didn't interest me. I gave it three stars because Amazon did it's job, but Elle is not as impressive."
3,Worth the $5,"I can't really complain about this subscription because I'm pretty sure it was only $5... But I'm still going to! The mags come so late and infrequently. I think I've received 4 issues since I subscribed in July or August and it is almost February. However, $5 is about the price of one issue so if you don't care about when/if you receive the issue it's a good savings."
5,Elle magazine,"Love Elle magazine! When it arrives, I'm scouring the pages to see the latest fashion and accessories idea's. Keeps me plugged into what's hot in Hollywood. As a jewelry designer myself, it's important for me to stay up-to-date on the latest designs and colors and/or color combinations. Even though I cannot afford the majority of the items in this magazine, it motivates me to produce my beadwork on the cutting edge of fashion. Thank you Elle!"
3,Lots of Ads,"I thought Elle would be similar to Cosmo with different types of ads and articles, but Elle is really just the pictures of really expensive clothing and jewelry and shoes. I didn't care much for it."
3,Meh.,"Better than Bazaar, but not wonderful. Not much substance, decent photography, more advertising than content, which seems to be the trend."
2,i do not like.,"this magazine is waste money, even though it was really cheap, when i purchased. but it was useless. all ads nothing can improved fashion value."
1,Very disappointing,I purchased this magazine in July and was told that I would receive it in October and that Amazon had no control over this. Then why are you selling it???
2,Why so long?????,I ordered this subscription to ELLE magazine and the price was good. I got a card in the mail that informed me that the subscription won't start for 3 months. This seems like a long time.
2,Not for me,It has ads for things I can't afford. $2000 for shoes? And plenty of Armani & D&G advertisements. I will get something else when it expires
1,Got a bill but no magazine,"Decided to try out Elle magazine with the 6-month special offer. I live overseas so I expected it to take a little longer to receive the magazine but imagine my surprise when last week I got a bill stating that my subscription had ended. I HAVEN'T EVEN RECEIVED THE FIRST ISSUE!!!! Needless to say that I will be saving my money and not renewing my ""awesome"" introductory offer."
1,Don't Waste Your Money $$$$ on this piece of Junk,"I bought this flat panel believing that Sony produced high quality electronic goods. Boy was I disappointed, as soon as I took it out the box I notice a dead pixel in the upper right hand corner of the screen. I took back and exchanged it for another unit. The manager at Compusa, warned me that Sony won't consider it a defect unless there were at least 20 dead pixels in the center of the screen, so if the second unit is defective he couldn't do any thing for me. I get home and install the replacement monitor, and ""Bam!"" another dead pixel, this time in the center of the screen. Sony is junk and produce junk. Don't Buy!!!!!"
4,Excellent value,"The contrast is not like anything I have seen. This baby rocks. No ghosting in games brighter than my sony GDM500 21The colors are fabulous. No more ""heater"" in my office and no more radiation. This monitor is also beautiful so its a real winner. I plan on the 19"" version as well. Buy it you wont be dissappointed. Only down side i could give it is no dvi imputbut picture is fabulouse so no big deal"
5,Great Product,"This is a real quality product. The brushes made my hair soft, shiny and manageable. I am going to buy another for my sisters birthday since it is such a great value. I highly reccomend buying this product!"
1,NNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOO,it is a fun game e for every won right RONG IT STARTS SUPER EASY THEN ON LEVEL 36 IT GETS ULTRI HARD IF YOU WONT A EASY GAME GET SUPER MIRIO DS..
2,terrible controls bog down a normally good game.,I remember this game for the n64 and was excited to see what would happen with it on the ds but once i got it i realized what a horrible mistake that i made...the controls suck they couldn't be harder and if you are like me and had a hard time using the stylus in super mario ds then this is no different. i think that i'll just go to my friends house and play the n64 version instead of this...
2,Controls too hard,"I am deployed in Iraq and bought this game to pass my time when I'm off work. I spend my hard earned money ont his game so I tried to complete the game. The game was fun, but the controls were way too hard. I got about half-way through and got so frustrated with the controls I put the game up. If you don't mind difficult controls, this game is fun."
3,pleasently interesting,There are some things that were confusing (speed of game and controls at first) but overall I did enjoy the game.this game does move fast at times and has many puzles to keep you entertained enough that you may not find every thing the first time around the level.one major dislike was that to do the bonus levels you did have to go throught the level each time to play them.
3,"Rayman DS ""Rayman 2 On The Go""","2 years ago, the nintendo ds was ready for launch.... The big title was Mario 64 DS....The title I was looking foward to Rayman Ds.But sadly, it was pushed back to march or april so i pre-ordered. Alright lets get to the game!!!The game is a cool typical platform game. Fun exciting, theres adventures to explore and more fun. Even though this game, is a Rayman 2 port i still enjoy it. I like the features with the nintendo ds touch screen.I can track how many Lums I collected and rayman's Rayman's health on the bottom touch screen. Lums are yellow things you have to collect during the game and theres about 40 different levels to explore. I recommend this title if you have a nintendo ds and your in the mood for a good platformer."
4,good but can use some improvement,i got rayman ds a few weeks ago and its is pretty fun but the graphics aren't that good and the camera angle was real bad at times. I have never played rayman 2 so it is a fun advenature. One more bad thing is the graphics are pretty dark and the bottom screen is unimagitive. overall i think this game is very fun and challenging. I recomend this to anybody
3,,The classic rayman is back and this time more techniques its an altime best. ERR its the exact same rayman except on a different console. If uve played it b4 its not worth it because its the same thing on another console but if u havent played it give it a go its still a rather good game.
3,Okay adoption music,"Music is okay. Most of the songs are fun, but I was hoping for something a little more poppy"
2,"When the central character is obnoxious and boring, the novel doesn't work","I'm a Harry Turtledove fan, and am willing to overlook a lot of flaws in his writing if the basic idea is fun or intriguing. But a novel with a one-dimensionally insufferable character whose transformation makes him one-dimensionally selfish violent and cruel just won't work magic. The religious system (Zoroasterian or Manichee) where 2 one-dimensional gods battle it out could have been treated imaginatively, but this never got off the ground either."
3,Not quite what I was expecting,"This was only my second book written by Turtledove that I have read. I randomly picked this book up at my local library after having read After the Downfall. I didn't realize it was part of a series at the time. It took me a while to get going with the book, probably 60 pages or so. I thought about not finishing it, but was actually trying to figure out where this book was going to go. After the initial investment I finally started getting into the book and the mid section I couldn't put it down. I think the one short coming is the begining seemed slow and it took a while to become interested in the main character"
2,Evil can be plain boring,"The main character here is a prelate transferred from Videssos the city to an outlying province, who is gradually corrupted by Skelos. The transition from good to evil is not especially convincing. The characters are uninteresting, and the plot is predictable.An unnecessary sequel. Hopefully this is an aberration; I've many good books from this author. But I won't buy the next one in this series without reading reviews first."
4,Karen Morrow is AWESOME!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!,"Let me start by saying that I am a Karen Morrow fan and therefore may be a little biased. I think that Ms. Morrow has one of the most wonderful ""belt"" voices this century. However, most of the women songs that she would be wonderful singing (like ""Dolly"") are performed by Lee Roy Reems. (I am sorry but I think that he is a self-obsessed queen.) If you like Jerry Herman, Karen Morrow, or are a Reems fan (since he does sing most of the music on this disc) buy it!"
4,Great detail!,"Wonderful pirate play fueled by imagination! The size is just right for a play pirate ship, as well as for small hands. The colors are bright (without being garish-cheap looking), and the attention to detail is nicely done. Accidentally left outside in rain, mud and hot sun, this figure, as well as the other Papo Pirate Figures, have cleaned up to resume play looking like new!"
5,Good,"They serve the purpose for what I need to do, my clients love them they're soft between the toes and help with keeping you from messing up the polish."
3,disappointed,"more description needed. mentioned assorted colours, received only one colour. Ordered this product for a spa party theme, but with the colours received, useless!!"
3,Small and flimsy,"These are perfect for a little girls party, but anything else , ehhh. They are too small fro an adult or teen to use, and they break easily. I wouldn't recommend them to anyone if they need them for anything other than a little girl."
5,I love these toe seperators...,"Low price & I think these are actually really Great...I'm not sure what the others were expecting from these, but the toe separators I received are very firm & do the job well... I'm glad I didn't pass over this product, by reading some of the other reviewers I almost did... I'll add some pictures..."
1,Dont work,"very flimsy, won't work because of the flimsyness of the product. Just paid like a dollar but not even worth the dollar. I just threw them in the trash"
4,Bought For Bachelorette Party,A little on the flimsy side but the colors are pretty and perfect for a one or two time use at a Bachelorette gathering.
5,Great cat food,"Wellness makes really good, healthy cat food. My cats really like this food, and I like that its really healthy for them and is made with high quality materials. I believe that if cats eat healthy, high quality cat food, they will have less medical problems and live longer. I think the phrase ""we are what we eat"" applies to all species."
2,ugh!,"I'm a high school student, and I had to use this book for my AP macro and micro class... such a BAD BOOK!, no only the wording was extremely difficult, there aren't enough graphics! >:("
2,Tedious at best,"If you enjoy reading everything from the viewpoint of three people, this book is for you. Otherwise, you might find it, as I did, very tedious. Also, these 3 girls should have stayed home. The author has done better."
5,a great gift,"a great winter holiday gift for my son--they are great fit, comfortable but sturdy--warm and cozy for the winter"
4,Curiouser and Curioser,"These may be some of the strangest tales I've ever read. The Celtic Twilight reveals a side of Yeats that is not usually seen in his work. Many of the stories seem unbelievable, yet Yeats reports them without any sense of skepticism or ridicule. Whether they are true or not, they reveal a very active aspect of the Irish cultural consciousness, which is the imagination. In our modern world, imagination doesn't get much respect, but I believe it is the doorway to realities beyond the material world. The tellers of these tales were obviously quite familiar with this doorway.This is not a book for the materialistic, scientific mind. But if you are open to the strange realities that science cannot explain, you may find some interesting food for thought here. Or maybe the storytellers simply liked to spin fantastic tales. I will leave it to you to decide."
4,"Awesome program, but be sure to update immediatley","I'm not going to go too much into the amazing robustness of this program. It is hands down the best wysiwyg + coding program out there. Even if you are a hand coder, it will help you be more productive. Be sure you have a lot of computer resources for it as it is still a hog, but better than previous versions.**Mainly, I just wanted y'all to know to go to Dreamweaver's site immediatley after getting this program so that you can install v6.1 updater.** I was surprised it shipped as the older version."
3,"Dreamweaver MX 2004 - good for PHP, bad for people","I am a big fan of Dreamweaver 4 and have been trying MX 2004 because my DW4 broke. All i can say is it's a great for writing PHP scripts and not much else. Once i switch to design view, i am confronted with stupid things like the cut and paste feature messesing with my code.If you Google the phrase ""Dreamweaver 4 compatible editable regions"", you'll find a hack useful in helping all who still stick to the old DW4 template syntex."
3,Only works in Code View,"Installed Dreamweaver MX to do basic website updates on a multi-page HTML and CSS based site. The program works fine in Code View, but when I switch to Design View or the Split View, the whole program freezes and I have to restart. Be warned, if you're using Windows XP SP3.Also note, this product is not eligible for the upgrades to Dreamweaver CS4 - only MX 2004 and above are eligible for upgrade pricing from Adobe.Apart from those caveats, Dreamweaver MX is a good code editor for websites."
1,Macromedia...you've lost my business.,"Macromedia...you've lost my business. Other reviewers are right...Dreamweaver has become bloat-ware with too many features no true web-professional needs.Once upon a time I loved Dreamweaver. It was a great code editor with a simple to use FTP client. But, I've had enough; Dreamweaver MX crashes on me 4X a day on average. I'm going in search of a clean and simple code editor. If I can find one that has some kind of code complete feature for XHTML, CSS and ASP.net, so much the better.Furthermore, thanks to WYSIWYG editors, I fear that too many developers out there don't really know what they are doing anymore. If you're a novice, here is my advice: learn to hand-code XHTML & CSS for your front-end web development and embrace W3C web standards. I'm serious...do this and you will become a very valuable resource...maybe I'll hire you someday.Always remember this: the code editor is not your tool; the code is."
1,More Crashes Less Work Done,This product consistently crashes multiple times a day. Usually javascript errors or unknown errors. Yes it does rewrite code incorrectly at times and has cost me more work lost than I could actually get done by using it. It is ust an overbloated text editor. Support is horrible. This product is a waste of time and has been since it first introduction. I only use it occasionally because it is slightly better than the most basic text editor and then I still cringe.
1,Too complex for this beginner,"I'm new to web design and heard DW was powerful, so that's what I got. I found it overwhealming, way too much for a beginner. I've had it a couple months, I've spent a lot on tutorial books, and still haven't gotten usable results -- though I'm so frustrated now I've mostly given up.To be fair, if you're an experienced web design professional, it looks like a useful program."
3,Not worth it..,"I don't own this product, but I have used it to (try to) make my website, and to tell you the truth, it's at best just as easy as using notepad and internet explorer. What you do in this program is type the code, and click on the bottom half to see progress as it happens; there are a few tools like frame maker that simplifies the process, but is also somewhat confusing. The folder management is a nuiscance (it makes its own folder and you have to put all the files into that). If I were you, therefore, I would keep my 200 bucks and spend it on something more useful."
4,"Man, harsh and............interesting!","First of all, let me just say that the 25 minute silence at the beginning of the cd is not necessarily needed(what is with this trend, first Vader then Mayhem...who's next to blow us away with silence?) Anyway, the first 4 tracks are pure Vader! Very harsh, very fast, very heavy! Great vocals and great playing! Then comes the last two tracks. They are Vader songs remixed by a couple of DJ's who's names escape me at the moment. The first one is actually good if you're also into the industro-techno music like I am. The second one left much to be desired, not much going on, you just forget the track if you don't pay attention to it. Overall, very good EP, nice twist of having techno remixes of songs on here. I'm sure true death metal fans became very sour at listening to those."
4,Good Sink,"Purchased this for clients ADA bath. The shipping was good, product arrived undamaged. Sink was easy for plumber to install. Clients like the sink."
1,Buyer Beware!!,"Beware to all Jan and Dean fans. This is not Jan and Dean on this CD. It is studio outtakes, probably Sloan and Barri (the fantastic baggys). You can hear Dean on a couple of cuts, just barely. The live takes have someone singing lead I have never heard. This is a real rip-off and I can't believe it is being sold as ""JAN & DEAN"". I have been a fan since the 1960's and it is NOT JAN and DEAN SINGING!!!"
3,Please consider this,"I rated this book at 3 stars because Amazon wouldn't let me bypass the rating. I tried to bypass the rating because I know the author too well to be able to be objective. Also I'd like to see one or two thoughtful reactions from people who are hostile to Christianity. They're the ones he wants to engage. The book is very like the author himself...outrageous and fascinating and funny and very serious and hard to put down. Neither author nor book needs a `put-down' because both are completely genuine and unpretentious creations. Although he's quite convinced himself that Christianity is `right' he knows it can't be `proved right'. So instead of knockouts or put-downs, he goes for the infinitely superior `please consider this'. That's the closing sentence of the book and it's what made it so appealing to me."
5,Refreshing Discussion @ Christianity and Science,"Professor Schaefer is refreshing, humorous, and insightful about a ""hot topic"" today -- the intersection of science and religion (or more specifically, Christianity). This world-class scientist lets his readers benefit from the decades he has interacted with his prominent peers in science around the world. Reading his book was like sitting down one-on-one with the author to discuss his views and the views of many prominent scientists he quotes.Professor Schaefer's book is bound to stimulate Christian and non-Christian readers to think more deeply about science and Christianity. I am confident a wide range of readers will enjoy this well-written book as much as I did. Professor Schaefer's book is a ""must read"" for 2004."
3,"The ""Who's What"" book","The value of this book is to give the views of many name-brand scientists on the issue of God / creation. And that results is the idea that "" key scientists do believe in God"" so apparently science has not "" disproven Him"" . Because the author achieves his goal ( ""5"" for this).Personal ancedotes are inter-twined throughout...and this sometimes keeps the work from being coherent ( but the text reflects a real lecture...so the lecture was a bit waverly at points).The book achieves its basic purpose of showing that science is not against God but does not produce a sustained argument to that effect. What you get is mostly quotes from fellow scientists . Less personal stuff and more interaction with the ""quotes"" would have been better ( ""2"" for this ). Hence, about 3 for the book."
5,Fuel for Thought,"Schaefer's content, though deep, is distilled down so that we can all enjoy. I have long felt that the perceived division between scientists and Christianity was more in the minds of the rookies than inherent within the halls of the academy. Indeed, this book underscores the fact that there are many scientists who honor God."
4,They are compatible,"""A thought provoking book that will encourage those whotake for granted that science and Christianity areincompatible to look more closely at important issues.""Dr. Tucker Carrington, Jr."
5,Book Captures Author's Public Wit & Personna,"Science and Christianity: Conflict or Coherence?by Henry F. Schaefer, IIIHaving ""seen the movie"" with great pleasure, I was reticent to ""read the book,"" thinking it would lose something. I was not disappointed when I finally did. I have been in Dr. Schaefer's audience many times as his lecture host, international liaison and traveling companion. ""How could a book,"" I therefore wondered, ""capture the warmth, spontaneous wit, wonder, and disarming humor that make Fritz so appealing to curious academics, young and old?"" Indeed Science and Christianity does all that, transporting you into Schaefer's hundreds of public lectures on the university circuit. Not only are these lectures timelessly preserved from two decades, but they are fresh. I was delighted to see the new scholarship and developments in a chapter which I last heard ten years ago.""- David DeHuff, M.A.,Christian Leadership Ministriesat the University of Pennsylvania"
5,A hidden treasure indeed!,"""Professor Schaefer's book is an inspiring contribution that is backed with solid arguments, which in turn make you reflect very seriously about your own position on the issue. This is not only a wonderful reaffirmation of the coherence between science and religion, but also a warm and optimistic story of the random walk the author took toward the most important discovery he ever made. I really hope the reader considers and meditates carefully on the questions that this stellar and distinguished scientist poses and the answers he provides. Within is a hidden treasure to be found indeed. This is a book that ends with a very positive message; one that will make you stop and reflect on where your life is heading."""
4,More Good News for Modern Man,"Henry Schaefer's delightful new book is just what is needed to bring the good news that the relationship between the two great knowledge systems, the bible and science, is increasingly one of partnership, rather than conflict. As would be expected from Professor Schaefer, this book is very well researched and objectively presented. For those who are interested in this subject, I would also recommend the books of Dr. Hugh Ross, especially ""The Genesis Question."""
3,Unexpected long time,"It took quite a long time for the company to find the book, I think. After I received an order confirmation, the order seems stopped. Not knowing when they are going to ship my item, I emailed them. Fortunately they still remember me and shipped my order."
3,"Some good info, but consult with your doctor first.","I read the informational chapters and then completed the questionaires. According to the book, I could benefit from the Protein Plus One plan. After reading the proposed diet plan, however, I have some doubts about its nutritional value. First, as a woman in her mid-forties, I am concerned about getting adequate calcium. I am also aware that studies have shown that high protein intake can increase calcium loss. I recommend any women forty or over who try this plan find ways to substantially increase their calcium intake. Also, there is building evidence that chromium picolinate (one of the suggested supplements) can cause DNA damage. Dr. Perrone suggests throughout his book that you should consult with your doctor before trying one of his diet plans, and I highly recommend that you do exactly that. Otherwise, you could be losing a lot more than body fat."
5,Hopeless about getting back in shape? Read this book.,"Fair, fat & 40. Feeling hopeless about my Size 16 self. I have been battling to get back in shape for the past 8 years - starving myself, eating low fat, almost all carbohydrates. Always feeling like I was dragging an anchor. Now I know why - ""Carbohydrates were wreaking havoc on my body."" Within 10 days - I feel better, people are asking me, ""What are you taking?"". PROTEIN. I can not thank Dr Perrone enough. I would recommend this book to anyone who has failed at the countless attempts to feel better, look better, get healthier."
4,Not bad for the price paid,A brand new book with a small water stain on almost half pf the pages (at bottom - does not interfere with the text)
4,Quality Product,Exactly what I needed! The product is just as pictured and the quality is good. I will reorder in the future.
5,Humble Servants of the Lord,"An Excellent Experiential Theology of Servant hood by Dr. Warren W. WiersbeHere are three nuggets of enlightenment:""Ministry takes place when divine resources meet human needs through loving channels to the glory of God ""God doesn't want us to have ""ministry by imitation"". He wants ""ministry by incarnation"" what Paul wrote about in Philippians 2:13 ""For it is God who works in you both to will and to do for His good pleasure"".""To consider persons and events and situations only in the light of their effect upon myself is to live on the doorstep of hell"""
5,read it often and reflect on it's wisdom,I purchased a dozen for the leaders in my church. I have been through it at least 3 times and am totally confident that it will be extremly helpful to others.
1,Poor service,I still have not received the item ordered. It has been a month since it was ordered. Is there any way to cancel this order and start again with a new vendor?
5,Richer than most,"Really like these incense sticks, they seem richer than most incense. Has a fuller scent without being cloying. Makes the house smell like sandalwood rather than cats."
5,A Good Reprint from 1929,"This is a Dover reprint of SMALL HOMES OF ARCHITECTURAL DISTINCTION: A BOOK OF SUGGESTED PLANS DESIGNED BY THE ARCHITECTS' SMALL HOUSE SERVICE BUREAU, INC., originally published by Harper & Brothers Publishers, New York and London, in 1929. Yes, it was a long title, but Dover is doing a disservice to old book collectors by changing the titles. That said, it is a good collection of examples that could be easily adapted for today's living, especially for those who want a not-so-big house. The cover says that there are 254 houses and each are shown with floor plans, including the second floor where applicable, and a view of the exterior, either a rendering or a black & white photo. In some examples, details are also presented with sketches or photos. This is highly recommended for all interested in traditional residential architecture."
1,Needed magnifying glasses,"Probably a great read. I'll never know because the print was so unbelievably tiny, I thought it must have been a joke. I got punk'd!Larger print please; most people old enough to want to read about Voltaire are already in reading glasses that don't get much stronger.Nice front cover, I must say."
2,My Ears Glaze Over,"Stargazer, recorded in 1997, features the same band employed in Douglas's Booker Little tribute recording, In Our Lifetime (Douglas on trumpet, Chris Speed on tenor sax and clarinet, Joshua Roseman on trombone, Uri Caine on piano, James Genus on bass, and Joey Baron on drums), this time around playing ""music by and for Wayne Shorter."" As with the earlier recording, but even more so this time, I found Stargazer to be quite tedious. Oncer again, there were some interesting moments, but the most part, the performances were overly earnest and overly busy. Drummer Baron especially overplays his part this time around, just overdoing it and not letting the music breathe. I think I could maybe have enjoyed this CD had a different, more subtle drummer been employed and I have heard Baron do much better on many other recordings -- not sure what the problem was on this outing), but in the end, this recording simply wore out my patience."
5,this is it!,"This is THE dave douglas recording. On this great disc Dave shows his enormous skills on trumpet and as a composer. For me personaly as a big Douglas fan it's one of his most exciting recordings. THE recording of dave you must have from his sextet because his other groups are even good but it's quite different. What makes this recording so special? the exciting and perfectionated sound of the group, dave's personal trumpet sound and skills, the great original compositions, etc.... i could go on for long but what really makes it so special is that feeling you get when hearing the disk play and that feeling will increase the more you play the disc. how more you'll play it how more you'll love it and become a Douglas fan."
3,not what I wanted,I ordered these strings because I was experimenting the sounds of my bass.These strings were to flat sounding for me; no reverb.
4,bass strings,If you want flatwounds then you probably know what to expect. I threw these on a $100 Yamaha pawn shop bass that probably still had the original strings on it and they've done a fine job.
5,better than the original,The whole movie on one DVD instead of two vh s. Fast delivery. Great condition. It plays great. It also had special features and the preview that was show for the movie.
4,Hatari,"My grandson loves animals, and this is a good family movie with lots of African animals in it. We watched it after opening our Christmas, and the entire family enjoyed it."
4,Classic John Wayne,"A classic John Wayne film. This film takes place in Africa where Wayne and company have a business capturing mostly large animals for zoos. The action sequences are well done and it's great to see the abundance of African wildlife. My 7 year old loves this show and loves the ""pockets"" character (played by Red Buttons) in particular."
1,FIFTY BUCKS FOR A ONE DISC DVD?!,"I have loved this movie since I was a child. I have it on VHS and have watched it many times. I would love a new copy of it on DVD for my collection, but at $50 for a bare bones, one disc edition? GET REAL!!! Ludicrous at best, ridiculous at worst."
1,...,"Grrr, my husband used my giftcards last night to buy this stupid movie. I was going to cancel the order and re-order without the giftcards box checked but they already shipped. Sheesh, they're fast shippers, I'll give them that."
2,Slow-Import?,"Movie arrived slower than expected. It also had a ""Made in Mexico"" label on it. I am not sure this is a legal copy."
2,Didn't work for me..,"Hatari!Much to my dismay, I was unable to watch this movie on my computer. I don't know if it was the feed or what. It skipped and stopped repeatedly. The voice was not in sync. Hopefully I can figure out the problem."
1,Ripped off,This DVD will not work. We were ripped off. Do not buyAnything from this vendor. We were surprised that this happened.
1,have not seen it yet!!!!!,it has been a month and i have not received it yet. does it always take this long to get a movie? it might be good if it ever arrives.
1,Hatari,I could not watch it because it was not for my region. I never had that problem with any other videos I had ordered. I sent it back and got a refund. I was very disappointed that I was unable to view the film. It is one of my favorites.
1,Hatari,I have never brought movies from Amazon and I don't think I will be doing that again ..after this purchase...I received this movie in the mail very poorly packaged to begin with. I thought they could have done better with the shipping. The movie does not play at all...If you decide to buy movies from Amazon make sure they are new and not like this one that I brought(used)...I have brought used movies before and they have never been this bad that they don't work at all....To top it off it was a christmas present for my husband...I am so very disappointed.
1,Hatari!,"the damn thing wont work I cant play it at all, keeps saying error. So i paid for something that not worth a dime"
5,Great Movie,This is one of my favorite John Wayne movies.. I enjoy watchimg John Wayne movies and I was happy when I found this DVD..
5,love this movie!Z,i saw this movie as a teenager and fell in love every other John Wanye movie had western. so i wasnt interested but my aunt insisted. Iam so glad she did!
5,Bad Reviews are Bogus,Recently it appears several people have rated this movie a 1 star because they didn't look at the region code in the section and ordered a Region 2 DVD which apparently they probably wanted Region 1. In my opinion Hatari deserves at least a 4 star rating.
3,DVD won't play,"I've seen this movie many times before, growing up. Looked forward to watching it w/ my kids the other weekend.Got the DVD, and when put in, got the ""wrong region code"" error; won't let me play it. Funny, since I bought it used, from a US vendor, to be delivered to me in CA.Go figure."
1,wrong regon,I ordered this it was to be regon one (u.s.a.) and it was for regon 4 i would like regon one sent with a return stamped envelope and I would send the regon 4 back
1,Hatari,The CD was a rewrap and was scratched so we could not watch it. So it was false advetisement of being new. I will not be ordering CD or any movies from here again.Juls
1,Great movie but wrong region,"When I bought this movie it never said what region the movie was, so when I got it it didn't play in my AMERICAN DVD player. I wasted my money on a movie that couldn't play. Then the company I bought it from was going to make me pay for shipping to get my money back. So I kept and won't do business with there company ever again ""MoiveMars"" I used my iPhone amazon app to but this movie so it's amazons fault or MoiveMars but someone should fixs this"
1,greek,"be careful of the zone for which the dvd is formatted for. i did not know this, some dvd""s are made for players in different parts of the world, i bought this one shipped from the u.s.a to the u.s.a and it only plays in japan! not language it wont play on eny player"
4,Not Inspirational,"I bought REVELATIONS thinking that it was a good religious book. In this day in age of uncertainty, I was looking for some answers. But it seems that this book is not religious; it is not even serious.I gave it to a friend in the hopes that someone might enjoy it. She seems to love it, and keeps quoting me passages. The 4-stars above are an average of my review and hers.This book gives no answers, only jokes: humor-jokes."
5,"A strange, but wonderful book","""REVELATION"" carves a new and unique niche in the stale field of humor books. At a time when books on humor had only a shock and novelty value, ""REVELATION"" shows that the written word can still be funny. I highly recommend this book, even if only for the bathroom."
5,A must have for Black Belt Test Review,I bought this for my son to help review his forms for his black belt test and he has improved a lot! Even his teacher commented that the improvement in just a week was remarkable.
2,Nice but...,The content of the video is technically correct but layout and quality of the video leaves allot to be desired. The editing of the DVD is wrong the video of the first form is actually Taegueg 2 not 1. One of the high forms shows a dog running through the frame.
2,hard to follow,I purchased this video for my 8 yr old who has a green belt. The master's accent is hard to understand. If you turn the sound off it's better. Wish I had not bought this. Would be good for someone oler.
1,"another rebate scam, stay away","What is it with rebates? Are they just hoping that only a certain percentage will take the time to fight for them when they are ""never recieved"" or ""missing the UPC (or reciept, or the whatever that was actually included!)""Well, this time, after waiting 10 weeks, I'm going to take them to small claims over their theft (failure to give me what's rightfully mine) of a $25 rebate. I'm so tired of rebates and rebate scams that it's time to take a day off and see them in court over this. Ridiculous? Yup, but so f-ing worth it."
3,Sony monitor is so so,"I first purchased a sharp 19 inch flat screen monitor, but returned it since it had a dead pixel. I decided to try the sony 19 inch model instead. The sony model also had a dead pixel, I think this is the biggest problems with flat screen monitors. But I also returned it and was able to get one without any dead pixels. I had the monitor for about a month and haven't had any problem like the other reviewers. The monitor is expensive, but so far I happy with it. Also, it does save a lot of space on your desk and is very lite.One disadvantage is it only has one analog input. The sharp monitor had two analog inputs and one digital inputs. With the sharp monitor I can hook up 3 computers to the same monitor. I have two computers and ended up buying a kvm so both computers can use the same sony monitor. The kvm will cost you about 40 dollars."
2,Sony quality in doubt,"This is a beautiful monitor but it went black after 1 week. It was quickly exchanged and the 2nd one went black after 5 weeks. (Green pilot light stayed on.) They were AC powered (120.0 Volts)in a university office environment (70F)with surge protection. Never lost a pixel on either one, however."
1,GREAT!,Plug-n-play with our WinME machine.Great display including viewing angle.Only had 14 days so far.1 pixel always white.
2,Not So Magical,Franklin Flyer is composed with shallow plots and minimal character development akin to the ideas behind 'March' or 'Gob's Grief' maybe even 'The Adventures of Kavalier and Clay' but the story was executed poorly and hardly worth finishing. Not at all as magical or gripping as it claims.
2,"pirate queen,not so much","too wordy and to much factual rather than story, not much about Grace O'malley more about the era. I was disappointed looking for more story like book"
4,"Useful, Inspiring, Dated","I read this book when it was first published, finding myself resonating and ""in tune"" to the essays which preface and follow the community description pages. The work itself is a great testament to the value of intentional Christian community as a way of life and a way of ""being the Church"". (I was once a member of Plow Creek Fellowship (a lifetime ago, it now seems) and was thrilled to read the words of those who remain.)Many of the communities mentioned no longer exist, something which indicates to me (hint to the author) that a new edition is in order. In my estimation it still rates, along with Dave and Neta Jackson's ""Living Together In A World Falling Apart"" and ""Glimpses of Glory"", as one of the best descriptions of what intentional Christian community is all about."
3,A great book that you might not want to buy,"This- along with all the other Imponderables Titles by David Feldman- is chock full of fascinating trivia and answers to many of Lifes little questions. If you have never read any of these Imponderable books before, I highly recommend it. However- if you are a fan of these books- you likely would be wasting your money. Why? becuase this is ""When did Wild Poodles Roam the Earth"" retitled, much as ""Imponderables"" itself- the 1st book in the series is now ""Why Don't Cats Like to Swim?"".So- do NOT buy this book if you already have ""When did Wild Poodles Roam the Earth"".I am not sure why Feldman is republishing his books with new titles, but it can be very confusing."
1,Disappointed,This was not informative and was misrepesented. The inside cover stated that it could be purchases for $19.15. Roofing Guidebook was sent. It consisted of 10 content pages all in upper case and 6 exact copies of the same sample contract. The illustrations consisted of the same sketch on each of the pages. Would not recommend this to anyone. Save your money!
5,Excellent Book,Lots of great information and pictures of each lighthouse. We have used this book to visit many of the lighthouses and to keep track of our visits. I highly recommend it for Michigan lighthouse fans.
3,not up to Hayden's standards,"This book fell short of my expectations. I love all of Torey Hayden's other books, but this one was written from more of a clinical perspective. It is still good, but I didn't feel like the characters realyl came to life or like I knew them when the book was other. As a teacher, I may have a bias towards her books set in classrooms, but I did enjoy Murphy's Boy which was not----so I don't think that is the problem."
5,great addition,This is a great Product. Look forward to adding it to my 86 house village next year!!!
1,Poor Support,"Backup Now has a nice user interface, but every time I tried to do a backup, I'd get a ""file not found"" message, then the backup would abort. I sent numerous emails to NTI tech support, but NEVER received a response. I finally returned the software as defective."
1,"A waste, don't trust it with your data","Hey guess what, it doesn't backup your Windows registry! Just wait and find that out after a crash...... Also, if a backup drive runs out of space, guess what the software does... corrupts your entire drive! This software is just poorly implemented and you should NOT under any circumstances, trust your data to this."
2,"VERY slow, lots of file errors, terrible product support","DON'T BUY THIS PRODUCT!!!! It generates all kinds of file errors which are not understandable to the common man. It is very slow, and with compression turned on, it CRAWLS!! The product support is TERRIBLE!! The interface, on the other hand, is a dream come true. It has beautiful, logical, easy-to-follow steps to make your backup file. One thing I don't quite understand: I back up to an external USB drive and it breaks up the backup into several files names. I can't quite figure that one out:-( I have been using Acronis True Image 9 for a while now and LOVE it and would recommend it over NTI."
1,Backup support was non existent when needed,"When my hard drive failed I attempted to recover my data to another computer. The new backup hard drive label (D) was different from the prior hard drive label (E). I could never download data to the new computer from the backup hard drive. I sent at least five emails seeking support and received NO help, NADA. It was like having an airbag that wouldn't deploy when you needed it. It was too late to find out that it didn't work. I now use GoodSync which is very cheap and easy to use."
5,Fascinating Subject - Very Readable Book,"I'm not sure why the review below is so negative. Actually, I have been re-discovering Keith Jarrett and, once this reviewer complained about the reviews in the book, I was sold! Just what I was looking for to help me sort through the huge back catalogue! Mr Carr has written this bio in the time-honoured fashion. He does not heap praise on Keith Jarrett's every recording. He reviews every disc (up to the end of the eighties) as one would expect from a biographer - we can't all see an artist live whenever we want to - most of us rely on these ""records"" of the artist's sound, style and progress or whatever. He gives examples of Jarrett's genius and of his to-be-expected-of-a-person-like-this idiosyncrasies and lets us make up our minds about the man. It's worth reading just for the incredible circumstances surrounding the ""Solo Concerts"" and ""Koln Concert"" recordings. Recommended. Hope he updates it in the future."
1,Not what I expected.,"I expected this would be a hose like a soaker hose but would only drip. I was hoping for something I could use more than once a week under current restrictions.Also, no invoice was enclosed so returning it will be major hassle."
3,Disappointing for comfort,"I bought these for the comfort that was advertised. I found them to be OK, but not what I expected. I wouldn't wear them for long walks..Also the first time I wore them, I got a blister on my big toe from where it rubbed."
5,For the Puzzle Junkie,"I knew if I looked on Amazon I would find exactly what I was looking for. My 78 year old neighbor brings the newspaper over every morning, has coffe and does the Jumble. This is the ultimate puzzle book. It has enough room on each puzzle page to figure out the mixed-up letters and solve the puzzle. Perfect gift for Christmas."
5,jumble review,"I thought this would be an interesting book, but the author has obviously failed to learn how to spell. The book made absolutely no sense at all to me. Printed nicely, though."
2,not good for buried small objects,"Will not pick up a coin or ring if it is buried more than 1/4"" in the ground - it will pick up a soda can that is 6"" deep. Not a good choice if you are looking for a lost ring, unless you are sure the ring is not buried at all. This would make a good toy for the kids."
3,Fun,My son really liked this item. Only problem is that you had to be right on top of an object for it to buzz so he soon got sick of playing with it.
3,no ear phone jack,"When I looked at the picture of the metal detector there was a earphone jack, on mine there was not. Other than that a good metal detector."
3,Metal detector,"was a good beginner metal detector, had fun using it so far! delivery was ontime and price was good!"
2,Not a good buy,Bought this for our pre-teen son for a present. The volume/sound went out within a month and the detector needle was overly sensitive. I don't recommend this product.
4,lots of fun,"this thing may not be top of the line but for what I paid, it is awesome. it gets hours of use is light weight and so much fun."
1,no headphone jack,"I ordered it because it showed in the photos that it could be used with headphones. My model didn't come with any 1/4"" headphone jack."
5,For Your Little Truck Enthusiast!,"What a wonderful find! I first borrowed this book from our local library, and ended up purchasing it. My son fell in love with it immediately. I read it to him the first few times, and then he began joining in the fun. His favorite thing to do was yell ""stop!"", ""no!"" and ""yes!"" while pointing to the appropriate words. So, not only are the colorful illustrations entertaining and bright, but the book can also help your child start to recognize simple words! I would highly recommned this book to everyone!"
2,Trashy Town looked like trash,The book looked like it was taken from a public library (it had a stamp in it). Some of it was torn and written in. :(I was not happy with my purchase.
2,Illustrations disappoint... Where is the garbage truck??,"The illustrations are splotches of color and we don't get to see the truck. The focus is on the driver, not the truck. The refrain is catchy but the illustrations leave way too much to the imagination. I would suggest looking at this book before you buy, and decide whether you don't mind the blocky, minimalist style. Luckily I saw it at the library because I just can't get past the lack of pictures, nor did my son find it visually stimulating. What a disappointment, since he likes garbage trucks."
3,More Ordinary than Extraordinary,"I expected to love this book based on the reviews. My son is 4 and he does enjoy it, but it reminds me more of the books I read to him when he was 2. The graphic artwork is cool and the ""dump it in, smash it down!"" refrain is catchy, but that's about it. Here's the ""story"": 1. Mr. Gilly gets in his truck. 2. Mr Gilly makes six stops to pick up trash. Each stop readers are asked, ""Is the truck full yet?"" and cue the refrain. 3. Truck is full, trash is dumped , and Mr. Gilly goes home to take a bath. Very small children love this type of simplicity and repetition; this book is right for ages 2-4, not 4-8. Even so, I just find it uninspired. For the preschool set, check out Daniel Kirk's ""Trash Trucks"" and Cris Van Dusen's outstanding ""If I Built a Car."""
5,a fun favorite,My 2.5 year old son really enjoys this book. It is simple and repetitive which is great for his age. He already has it memorized.
5,A tritium display wrist watch for a gentleman.,"Even better than I expected! Beautiful watch. Very sophisticated. Very comfortable. Very visable at night. The second hand does have a tritium display tube, as advertised, so it will glow all night long, along with all the other tritium display tubes on the watch. Wow, a great tritium display without all the sports bling that I don't use. Be prepared to remove a link or two, or have a jeweler do it for you for around $10...the bracelet shipped with the watch is made for a large wrist. Two things that the write-up doesn't tell you: 1) the back has slots on the edge so it can be opened with a watch wrench, which can be purchased from Amazon, for those who like to replace their own batteries, and (2) the battery is a 371 (my watch came with a Renata 371). The watch is heavier than those made of poly, due to stainless steel case, which gives the watch a manly feel."
4,Melodious music,We got left behind by the rock music(?) era. We prize melody and emotion above all and Friml composed some of the nicest. Well performed and recorded. Takes us back to the days when listening to music was prized for its ability to make you feel good.
3,it's a fine pan but things do stick,The pan has a good weight and is very easy to clean so far. However my banana bread did stick pretty badly on one side. Next time I will oil and flour the pan even though my recipe doesn't say to.
4,Great Pan,I made my first cake in this the other day and when it was done it slid out of the pan perfectly and molded just right. the cake was so beautiful I just wanted to admire it instead of eat it. This is a really great pan for a really great price!
3,smaller THAN DESCRIBED!,"I just received this pan and see that it is indeed SMALLER than the described dimensions found in the product information on Amazon: Product Dimensions: 10.5 x 3.5 x 10.5 inches ; 8 ounces. In actuality, the pan measures 9.5"" x 3.25"". The accurate dimensions are found on the label attached to the pan. Amazon should update the information regarding this item to alleviate more returns of the product because it doesn't meet the written description. RETURN! Update: While the pan dimensions were not as described, the pan itself appeared to be of excellent quality. The customer service regarding this purchase was excellent, both from Amazon and from the seller."
4,A++,Great to cook with. Only used once so far and 7up cake came out great! Product was identical to description. Thanks!!
5,Can't beat the price,For the price you get a pan that bakes evenly and cleans up nicely. No it doesn't have handles but that's that's what they make potholders for.
5,Great bundt pan!!!,"I got this pan mainly for the price. I saw the other reviews stating it wasn't really ""nonstick"" and that nonstick spray would have to used. I've used it 3 times so far (using nonstick spray every time) and it's been great! I'm pretty careful with all my nonstick bakeware so I handwash them to keep the nonstick coating. So, far this pan meets my expectations!"
2,"Aweful, sticky mess... stay away.","I bought this when it was on sale and intended it for an angel food cake (boxed mix). This is way too small for any boxed cake mix... I ended up tossing out 1/4 of the batter to prevent overflow when baking. I also sprayed the pan with cooking spray prior to filling and baking. It did no good. I let the cake cool in the pan and went to take it out. WOW! This came out in clumps... no matter how I tried, it would not come out clean and pretty, which was the reason behind using this pan in the first place. I'm able to do okay jello molds in this... but for baking, it's useless. Don't waste your money. I should have known to not go with this brand. I have cookie sheets in this brand and they burn everything. Bad, bad experiences with this brand for me. I advise you to spend a few more dollars and get something with better reviews."
5,New direction mixed with his early endeavors,"Catchy, little, downtempo melodies with creatively processed instrumentation. The musical style is very relaxing but highly captivating and hypnotizing. Has a hint of IDM with some of the unusually spacey ambient electronics and rythms that complement the melodies. A challenging piece to listen to. You won't be bored listening to any part of this CD.When I put on the first piece, I'm listening all the way through to the last piece. When I'm not listening to this CD, I can't wait till I do.I really enjoyed his CD, ""Yonnondio"" and this new CD is more like that one than his recent works but so much is new. This is another direction for a musician with a long career. I think Peter Buffett is in his element with this new direction. I'm a fan again!"
5,If only...,"If only Peter Buffett made more albums like this...This album is superior in my collection. I haven't purchased any other of Peter Buffett's albums because none are close to this. Although I'm sure I would enjoy his newer albums with him singing, It was not enough to compel me.This is one of those albums that if I saw it in a music store, I would be tempted to purchase it again, just because I wish he put out more like it..."
1,"Don't buy this book, It's not a book","This is a terrible book, because it's not a book; it's a college workbook written by some idiot professor who gives you a quiz on what you should have learned having read the chapter. It doesn't tell you squat about Word 98 for the Mac. For instance, I have problems with my template; for some absolutely unknown reason, my template changed. I want to change it back to something useful. Such advice is not to be found anywhere in this ""book."" How about changing the attributes of the menus? Not to be found in this ""book."" How about getting rid of that idiot Microsoft ""window man,"" who suddenly appears when he thinks you're writing a letter? Nope. How about finding your old spell-check dictionary after having upgraded your OS? No such luck with any of those questions in this ""book."" The only thing this ""book"" helps you with is how to click the mouse. Whatever you do, don't waste your money like I did buying this ""book."" You're better off buying a Pet Rock."
5,"Great, comprehensive guide","This is a great reference book in many ways. It has extensive lists of translations (into English) of all the major works in tons of languages. The lists are arranged as a sort of literary and historical review of the translations, offering information about the stylistic differences between translations as well as each one's scholarly popularity and subsequent influence. On top of that, it includes several well-selected essays on translation theory that readers, translators, and professors will find interesting and useful."
4,Diary of a Southern Refugee During the War: By a Lady of Vir,"I am a student of history and am doing my final thesis on southern woman during the civil war. Thus, I have had to wade through numerous diaries to find what I am looking for. I was very impressed with this diary because it was well written and very intersting to read. I feel that it has something for everyone. It touches your heart strings with it's descriptors and the evident feeling behind them and it also gives awsome accounts of battles though letters and second-hand information. If you are in anyway interested in the civil war, then this is a wonderful book to start your journey with."
2,Runaway Judith: Shed No Tears for Her,"This is the sort of book that reminds you why the Confederacy lost. Women were more interested in their own fashion, etc., than in the travails of their newfound republic. The feeble introduction fails to highlight this fact."
5,Inspired whistful laptoptronic poetry,"Wonderful world is a more sophisticated album for Nine Horses than the more bombastic 'Money for All'. Both are released on David Sylvian's 'Samahdi Sound' label and features David Sylvian, Steve Jansen and Burnt Friedman. There are also a wider cast of appearances by Stina Nordenstam, Ryuichi Sakamoto, Keith Lowe to mention just a few. You get the sense that it is an extended Sylvian project and the mixing is his as well as the sensibility that is brought to the fore by his long history of mixing ambient electronic and acoustic music. However the presence of Freidman and Jansen deliver the innovative techniques. This is a widely under-appreciated album and will reward keen ears to experimentation, electronic and acoustic ambient music."
3,It's OK to Know What you don't Know,This box of interesting facts and fiction is something to have around when you are listless. It's an interesting assortment of challenges.
1,Disappointing,"I looked forward to receiving this and was very disappointed. The questions are very obscure, more academic than interesting. I prefer the original Trivial Pursuit Questions."
5,BEST READ FOR THE BUCK IN HANDLOADING!,"THE BASICS OF RELOADING has not changed. This book goes into very good detail on each aspect of reloading. The cost of this book is very low I believe because people are associating the book with being too old. TRUST ME, this will be a REFERENCE BOOK that you will not want to part with. It has more of the why's, how's and reasoning for doing each step than my new and expensive reloading manuals, at a tenth of the cost. This is not a recipe book, but a clear how and why book, worth the read of a new or old reloader. A definate read for the NEW or want-a-be reloader at a bargain price!"
5,Very helpful,"My 7 year old son got a pair of mice for Christmas and I got this book for him. He found it very helpful, especially when our two MALE mice actually had babies.Perhaps I should recommend this book to the pet store we bought the mice from, since it has some information on determining the gender of mice."
4,Doesn't tell you how to keep the stink down.,"Very colorful and informative book with great photography. Manages to pack a good deal of information into such a small space. Needs some more practical advice. Instead of ""wood shavings,"" for bedding, it'd be nice if the author pointed out that pine shavings help keep the odor down. Also, neglects systems of raising mice in large quantities. This would be good for reptile keepers who raise feeders."
4,"Yes, This is a very good album but......","...I simply cannot comprehend the extreme raves of many of the posted reviews for this. It's a very good album, chock full of melodic psychedelic folk-rock, reminiscent of REM, the Stone Roses, and fellow countrymen Teenage Fanclub. BUT, comparing this to the best works of the Byrds, Beatles, Hollies, CSNY, Big Star, etc.,....not to mention some of the CRRs' contemporaries, the Wondermints, the Shazam, Spongetones, Chris Von Sneidern, etc. - I'm sorry, but I just don't see it! In my opinion, the vocal harmonies aren't comparable, nor the songwriting chops. It's definitely one of the better efforts of this type for the 90's/00's, and if you like any of the above-mentioned bands, you'll like this also, but....don't expect a religious epiphany or a life changing event if you buy this!"
1,Battery last 10 min,My son was very excited about this toy but the battery last 10 min max regardless of how long you charge it. It's a cool concept but it needs to work. We are planning to return it.
3,Interesting portrayal of the life of a rising superstar,"When you here about a superstar like Tiger its natural to wonder where this incredible talent came from. The book is a bit of a mix of golf how to, parent child relationship and history of Tigers early years. If you are raising kids and want a perspective on what went into developing such a great talent the book offers some interesting insights. The book lacks the level of detail or story telling that could of showed us more of Tigers character and made the book a more interesting read. If you love Golf and want your kids to get involved with the great game this book is a must read."
4,A good 1st mouthpiece for tuba,"If you are looking for a good first mouthpiece to get for a tuba player, you could start with this one. Don't spend lots of money for a basic tuba mouthpiece. My 13 year old uses this one so that he has his own mouthpiece for the school tuba. You can spend more, but why."
1,Pewter USMC Insignia Pin,"Due to improper package, came broken. I sent a complain trought Amazon, but they never respond.Saludos, Allan."
4,Very interesting for both left & right handers,"I'm a 'lefty', 'southpaw', 'cack-handed' etc. My daughter bought me this for my birthday. It was a very interesting read.The only downside was that some of the chapters seemed too long, at over 30 pages? There were points when the topic of the chapter seemed exhausted, and was strung out, and on more than one occasion my interest waned, only to perk up on the next page when some new issue was introduced, and off we went again?What I liked best was the little anecdotes, like how it took years for Canada to decide whether to drive on the Left or the Right, with British Columbia & the Maritime Provinces not changing over until after the First World War, and then still over a number years between 1920 and 1924. Similarly how Western & Eastern Austria drove on different sides of the road until 1938.A fascinating read."
5,The One To Read First,"Keirsey's ""Please Understand Me II"" is good. But, his first book is a better one to read before this one. And, in my humble opinion, I agree with other readers who say the one to read first in order to understand the philosophical underpinnings of these books is Norman Thomas Remick's easy to understand, ""West Point: Character Leadership Education, A Book Developed From The Readings And Writings Of Thomas Jefferson""."
4,"A good theory book, but it's all too lifted from reality","The book gave very good overview of temperaments. What's missing is some statistics or scientific evidence to keep the very good theory connected to reality. I think most of the book presented an ideal theory, theory that got romanticized by the author. A shame, IMHO, because I 'believe' in MBTI personality typing. Nevertheless, a very good book."
4,"Not perfect, but highly valuable and interesting","Overall, I think this is a wonderful book and I even think it should be introduced in schools. When you take the test and find out your personality type, you can then read about your type. For the most part, its quite accurate, although I was reading things that were supposedly about me that weren't necessarily true. However, I feel it would be safe to say that practically everybody fits in roughly into one category mostly. But what I think is more important than just learning about yourself, but learning about others. This book teaches you some things you may loathe in others but its not their fault, just their natural personality. Next time you run into someone who is demanding, or a neat freak, or is loud and rude, you will be more tolerant of them. I would've given this 5 stars, because I think they should've expanded on the sub-types (I'm an INFP) instead of going on at length about the main types. But other than that, excellent book!"
5,Really like this book,I started reading this book a couple of weeks ago and haven't finished it yet due to the fact that most of my time has been consumed by a psychology class. The information in this book really went along well with what I was studying in my class. I find it very interesting and cannot wait to read the rest.
5,Excellent...,"Anyone interested in better understsanding human behavior, personality and traits must read this. You'll walk away feeling like a dimestore psycholgist! Interesting and informative, also easy to follow."
2,Disappointing compared to first edition,"I liked Kiersey's frst version very much, and used it frequently with my clients (I am a psychologist) as a good MBTI introduction. I think the revisions in this 2nd edition complicate the work too much and make it less targeted and clear. I'd still recommend the first Kiersey version."
5,The book I buy and give away.,"Please Understand Me changed my life. It validated who I was and helped me understand the relationships between family members from grand-parents to grand-children. In just a few hours, this book can improve the way you view yourself and others. I have given away many copies to friends -- thus my recent purchase to have a copy handy."
5,Favorite Book!,Words cannot describe how much I love this book. I keep a copy at home and at work. It truly provides a great framework for understanding people and what motivates them. I understand myself better and my loved ones and I am able to better work with them and accept them for who they are instead of becoming frustrted. This is a must read.
4,Surprisingly Informative,"I had doubts as to how useful or informative this book would be, but was pleasantly surprised on its content."
1,The most boring book to read on personality types,"This book is so dull, with such stultifyingly wordy passages, that even reading about one's own personality type is boring. I can deal with technical manuals (I used to write them for a living and have a graduate degree) without any problem, but bad writing just can't be overcome or rationalized away.Take the test online, read the distilled version of your personality type on the page(s) that follow(s), and never pick up this book if you care about your sanity and/or time."
3,Please Understand Me II,I find only one thing wrong with this book. In the first section it says you can refer to pages 346-348 for additional information. Hello! My book only goes up to page 343. Is this book a re-hash of the first one with pages omitted?
4,"May the best book on the subject, but ..............Arrogant","I've read for second time, its amazing, may change your life.If you want know a little more check suestilo.com, try Or wilson learning series on social styles or Disc books, basically is the same but from differente angle. May helps uderstand better all that knowledge!!"
4,Beneficial and introspective,"I love books that help you take a closer look into your own personality and temperament, and this one is perhaps the best I've found. The only difficulty I had with it was the test portion. It would have been even better if the book went over how to take the categorizing exam. Everyone I gave it to scored ""idealist"" when most clearly weren't and were just answering what they aspire to be versus what they actually are. If you are into looking at yourself, flaws included (I must stress that), and can get past this problem, this book is for you. In all, it covers how to be more accepting of our differences, which I greatly needed when I purchased it."
5,A very useful book ... highly recommended,"This book promotes self-discovery and/or understanding for others. I recommend it highly for all. I have run into very few people who are not facinated at how well Keirsey describes many of their traits.The previously-mentioned redundancy in many of the chapters is helpful if you just want to skip ahead to the section on your type.The one reservation I have found is his tendency to use technical words that have confused some people who are not used to these types of books. However, this is often not much of a problem for NT Rationals like me. ;)Buy it. I find it very unlikely that you will regret it."
3,Not as good as the first. But still interesting...,Please Understand Me II seems a tad redundant to me. The author reiterates his points often which can become quite annoying. But the historical section is a great read.I'd say this book is a good reference but not something you'd read from cover to cover.
5,if you really do want to understand other points of view,"I have loved reading this book. I was stuck home for while and found an old battered copy of the first 'Please Understand me"" - I was hooked. It is filled with nuggets of insight and has changed how I perceive the behavior of others. It has been great to be able to rethink people's behavior that bothered/upset/hurt me as operating with a different set of priorities and tendencies. It has also helped me manage how I relate to different people, minimizing some tensions (at least on my part).I am encouraging everyone to buy the book."
3,"Do People Behave Strangely Some Times (you feel), The Book Tell You Why","The book gives a good idea on why people act the way they do. It is very good in terms of understanding and tolerating people behavior and how and why it might appear illogical to the other person. The book give a very good analysis about human personalities and its study since ancient time, then give a thorough details about four types of personality as this considered the major four parts of personality.If you would like why people priorities in life might differ extremely from yours, this book might enlighten you on why."
4,Understanding yourself,This book provides a great tool for understanding yourself and your interactions with others. Use what it has to offer but don't go expecting everyone to behave the exact way described. Explore!
3,"comprehensive text, but not reader-friendly","This is a comprehensive text on temperament that advances the work and research done by Myers/Briggs. it's very detailed though and didn't give suggestions on how to apply the information. It's written by an NT. I think Innerkinetics by Ray Lincoln is easier to read and apply to your life immediately. This is more like a textbook or reference book, but the information is good to get a basic understanding of temperaments. But I would suggest buying Innerkinetics instead."
5,Life-Changing,"I have been carrying this book around like a bible for several years now, and always like to buy a copy for friends when the subject of their personality type or temperament comes up. This book is a thorough itemization of each type's basic motivation in life, and has helped me in working with ""different"" people in every area of my life. In addition, it's a great resource for myself when I'm preparing for an interview, as I can go to my type and review all the good things about myself. For further reading, I recommend ""Survival Games Personalities Play"" as a primer into how the different types may behave under stress."
3,Interesting Book But There's a Better One to Read First,"This book is interesting but also somewhat esoteric and opinionated. A much more useful book to start out with is LIFETYPES by Sandra Krebs Hirsh and Jean Kummerow. They also cover Myers-Briggs temperament preferences but in a more straightforward, readable, and immediately usable way. I am a psychologist and I have found LIFETYPES to be perhaps the most personally and professionally useful book I've ever found. If, after reading it, you want to explore different approaches to temperament and explore the topic in greater depth, then David Keirsey's work would be of interest."
3,Not as good as the first,"After reading the first ""Please Understand Me,"" I was eager to delve into the expanded 'sequel.' While the new information is useful, in my personal observations the additions are not as accurate as the original material. Once again the author fails to address borderline scores (which may account for some of the inaccuracies I've observed). Neverthess this is still a book worth reading."
2,"Complex, and Hard to Read","I found the new version of Please Understand Me to be hard to read, written in a very academic language. What made this book very easy to understand was a companion title I purchased called Understanding Yourself and Others, An Introduction to Temperament, by Linda V. Berens, Ph.D.. This book simplified the ideas in Please Understand Me II, but did not lose the richness of the concepts. I recommend purchasing it with Please Understand Me II, it is only $4.95."
4,Laugh out loud funny,"A great book and a fun jab in Americas ribs, especially during the Bush years. Some of the satire was a bit cliche but fun nonetheless."
2,Helprin looses it half way through.,"This book started off great, with subtle jabs at the Royalty, Parliament, etc. As it progressed, it became outrageously silly to the point that by mid-book I wondered why I was wasting my time. Helprin can do better."
3,Hard to suspend disbelief,"I loved the first one-third of this book, but the remaining parts flagged soon after our royals landed in America. I could suspend my disbelief as long as they were acting foolishly in the UK, but the fact that two of the most famous people in the world could go almost undetected for over a year (with missing or oversized teeth as their only different physical feature) was more than I could accept. Also, what was the deal with Freddy falling in love with Fredericka for chapter after chapter, and then oddly taking an interest in that park ranger? Helprin has phenomenal talent as a social satirist (a la Tom Wolfe), and I'd love to read more, if only he can keep his romps from totally straining credulity."
2,moderately amusing but tedious,"The first third of this book is hilarious, but once the characters are stripped of their endearing pettiness, fumbling, and other hang-ups, the book becomes weighed down by long-winded, anticlimactic speeches and descriptions. Helprin may have had good intentions, but after a while it started to feel he was hitting me over the head with a two-by-four inscribed with the words, ""WHAT DOES IT MEAN TO BE A KING?!"""
3,A round about way of lampooning US poltics,"I laughed out loud quite a bit while reading this novel, but I also skipped quite a few pages. A surprisingly quick read and yet makes some interesting commentary on US politics (strange for a novel 'about' English royalty. It's handy to remember that Helprin wrote campaign speeches for Bob Dole's failed presidential bid."
2,Terribly disappointed,"I am a passionate fan of Helprin's since I first read Winter's Tale as a child. I am still haunted by the extraordinary imagery of his previous novels and short stories. F&F is not a terrible book in an absolute sense, but compared to his past work it is a huge disappointment: a parody and a farce, worthwhile art forms of course but far from the most noble. This is not even that funny a farce. The ""important"" themes of nobility, leadership and love are not well served by the broad comedy, and the comedy isn't that funny when set against such themes. To me this book is a spectacular failure, and a shock coming from an author who has been note-perfect in the past."
2,Bloated and not nearly as funny as it wants to be,"What a waste of talent. Mark Helprin has done brilliant work in the past, but here he squanders his gifts on self-indulgent farce. Imaginative, yes, but that in itself is not a virtue, when the imagination leads him to take a lame joke (for example, an argument between the intellectual Freddy, a/k/a Prince Charles, and the dimwit Fredericka, or Princess Diana, as to whether she has one bosom or two) and spin it out for pages and pages. His view of the British royals is not entirely mean-spirited, but nor does it seem terribly well-informed. As one reviewer pointed out, the characterization of Fredericka owes more to press reports about Paris Hilton than it does to any real understanding of Diana. There are occasional flashes of wit and insight, but not enough for a book half the size of this one. I hope the next novel from Helprin will be worth waiting for."
5,The only book to ever make me laugh out loud,"Meet Freddy, the Prince of Wales. Freddy gets into some very strange situations through no real fault of his own, such as accidentally getting tarred and feathered while naked outside of Buckingham palace. Meet Fredericka, the princess of Wales, who may or may not be a genius or total moron. Meet Mr. Neil, a rubber sex toy maker who may or may not be ten thousand years old. Mr. Neil convinces the Queen of England and her prince consort that, in order to make themselves worthy of the crown, Freddy and Fredericka must re-conquer the American colonies after sky diving into New Jersey wearing rabbit fur and snake skin bikinis.As weird as that sounds, that is the plot of this truly hilarious and moving book about duty, courage, second chance, love and history. I didn't expect to enjoy reading this book and ended up loving it. It's a true statement of the human condition, the beauty of America, and the burdens of being a king, in every sense of the word."
1,Freddy and Fredericka by Mark Helprin,"The first twenty or so pages led me to believe that a great imagination might once again be at work. I have slogged through half the book, based upon the belief that a great writer must produce great works and the next page would justify my perseverance but sadly, this is one of the worst books I have ever attempted to read.Much of the dialog and repetitive scenarios, appear to be mindless, pointless and definitely very difficult to imagine as credible at any level.I find it hard to give the book to anyone as I cannot recommend anyone read it."
1,"Very, very desperately in need of an edit","I am sad to agree with the reviewer that said this was one of the worst books he/she had tried to read, because I was so excited to buy this book - from the description on the back to the enthusiastic one-liners from newspapers sprinkling the cover. It even started out nicely, with enormous promise in the first 15 pages or so, but ever since I have found almost every page painful to read. It is as if someone had a really elaborate dream they decided to write down ... nothing makes any sense, nothing seems to really drive the plot forward, and what could have been a fun premise instead is just words, words, words and even more words. It seems like it should be funny, it seems like a great idea, but none of it translates into anything with any real logic or that makes me want to read more about these characters and their adventures."
2,A Big Disappointment,"I am half way through ""Freddy and Fredericka"" and don't know if I will finish it, except to read the ending. The review of the book in our local newspaper, the Santa Rosa Press Democrat, was funnier than the book has been. I was laughing so hard over the review that I had tears running down my cheeks; that hasn't happened with the book, because its length seems to reduce the humor to silliness. Too bad."
2,No title.,"Mark Helprin is capable of writing some of the most elegant prose in contemporary fiction. He can make anything he describes sing with life. That is his strength. But he is no humorist and is out of his depth when he tries to be witty. He is alternately earnest and silly in this novel. The wordplay and puns are facile and make his more heartfelt observations, where he reverts to type, seem cringingly inappropriate. Freddy and Fredericka may have been a lark to write, but it is not all that much fun to read. I was distracted by Helprin's self-indulgence almost all the way through. At least the author had a good time. I did not."
1,Kindle price more than paperback price - really???,I am a Kindle user and will not be buying this book because the Kindle edition is more expensive than the paperback. Come on publishers - does it really cost more to produce a Kindle version than it does to produce and distribute a paperback?
1,"Unfortunately, a long winded and tedious read","This is the first book I have read by Mark Helprin, and I suspect it will be the last. Although there were bits that were genuinely clever, for the most part the book tried too hard to be witty and failed in the attempt. The characters, all of them, were annoying to the point of distraction and it felt as though you could have read about every other page and not missed a thing as it rambled on and on. I was really looking forward to reading this book and it was such a disappointment."
2,Giving Up!,"I've been trying to read this book for over three months and have only gotten through about 75 pages. It's wordy, tends to steer off-topic, and just does not hold my attention.There are funny parts, no doubt, and I've found myself laughing out loud at a few of them. But it's not good when I open the book each evening and forget what I'd read the night before.My boyfriend is a big Helprin fan, so I was excited to delve into this novel, but I'm afraid I'm going to have to shelve it for now. Maybe someday I'll have the patience to pick it up again."
2,A Big Disappointment for a Helprin Fan,"Helprin has become increasingly silly and has, it seems, lost his touchstone. Even where he attempts to rhapsodize about human existence in Freddy and Fredericka, he is too verbose and misses the mark. It is not horrible, but it is not great literature, either."
2,Returned,Durable? No. Does not go very high even if a powerful adult stomps... made horribly. We returned and would not recommend.
2,fun but didn't last more than one day!!,kids loved it but rockets broke easily and product only came with 2. I would not recommend as your little ones will soon be disappointed that toy broke so quickly even when used gently.
2,No Durability - no backup from company,"This toy came with a kink in the air line, so every time the line moved slightly, there would be insufficient flow to push the rocket upward. We ended up having to adjust this line every few launches. The 2 rockets that came with this were damaged within one hour of use. My two kids are not that rough with toys. Somehow with normal use, one rocket became bent in the middle and no longer would fit over the launch tube. That left us with only one working rocket. That one lost a portion of its padding on its top, perhaps from hitting a brush or coming through one of our trees. When it works, it's neat, but it doesn't have the proper durability for a toy for this age group.*Follow up. Company refused to refund or replace damaged unit. We will not be purchasing anything from this company in the future."
5,Super Cool!,You will love this book I gerinteeit! It tells you all about the mighty web-slinger himself!
3,"okay, just small","Worked out well,just wish they make the designs bigger. I think the outcome of final design would look better and maintain structure."
1,too small,"we have used patterns b4, but these were too small so they didnt work very well, they looked ok from afar, but we all said we would not use these patterns again"
2,not all that scary,"If you judge a book by the cover, you expect this book to be a fairly scary read. However, it really never gets to that level. The story takes place in a hospital with a very special little girl causing tragedies to those she percieves as a threat. But, many of the deaths she causes are for reasons that are not clearly explained. A quick read but a not particularly engaging one. This is out of print now and I wouldn't recommend going out of your way to find it."
4,Insights,"I bought and read this book because of a recommendation given to my husband by his communications course instructor. First of all, just having it with me was a communication helper. People would ask about the title and I would explain what it was about and why I was reading it. Secondly, I liked the book because it detailed numerous real life examples of relationships of those who are hearing impaired and includes the writer's/ psychologist's interactions, observations and recommendations for those individuals. But it was also very emotional reading and it taught me some things about myself and my communication issues. My only negative comment: I would have liked to see a few less examples and some sort of summation -- ""a putting together of it all"" at the end, but the author didn't do so. But I liked the book and think it will prove even more helpful as I read through certain portions again with a view to applying what I learn."
3,To many like it.,I have bought a lot of Mary Higgins Clark films. I usually love her stuff but this film was a bit boaring. I about fell asleep watching it. The plot line is not much different from a lot of action/suspense films. I was disappointed because I know that Mary Higgins Clark has done a lot better. I have several of her films and I would have to say that this one is at the end of the list. The actors were good but the storyline was not so great. If it would have been the first of its kind I might have given it a better rating but there are too many other movies like it.
3,"Orchestral Writing Superb, Vocal Writing Unkind to Voice","Much as this listener enjoys the orchestral works of Oliver Knussen the adaptation of Maurice Sendak's children's story/art book has never appealed. Now after hearing and seeing a complete production by the LA Philharmonic under the direction of Gustavo Dudamel the reason seems clear. When the orchestral portions are untainted by the wickedly difficult and unimaginative vocal writing (Max rarely is quiet and as sung by a soprano who is required to have a exceptionally plastic range his music is more than slightly irritating).This recording is probably as close to the expectations of the composer as any available - Knussen conducts the London Sinfonietta and performers (Rosemary Hardy meets the challenges with ease). He work is thankfully brief and often performed by opera companies in tandem with Knussen's other Sendak collaboration opera - Higglety Pigglety Pop! In a word, orchestral writing 5, vocal writing 1. Grady Harp, October 12"
1,Very annoying pauses between all tracks!,"The ones who recorded this CD should be ashamed of themselves for recording it with pauses between tracks, where there should not be any pauses! The music in most cases does not stop between tracks, so these pauses are extremely annoying! It's as if an amateur recorded this CD on a computer, using Nero, and forgot to tick the ""no pause between tracks"" box! What a terrible blunder! This utterly ruins one's listening experience! Shame on the ones who have recorded this CD and on the ones who are making people pay for the privilege of listening to this recording full of interruptions! If I had known, I wouldn't have bought it! So shame on the ones who did not mention this defect in the product description! Please note - the 1 star is for these interruptions, not for the music itself, which is OK."
2,too many tracks,the sound from this CD is great but there are so many tracks (25) that it sounds as though it is a defective CD due to the multiple interruptions from one track to another for such a short piece.
5,inspirational true story,"Lou Zamperini is ""Indiana Jones"" with a New Testament Bible. He's been an Olympic star and a WWII hero, but his toughest challenge came at Billy Graham's first crusade. 37 minutes long."
4,WOW! BLAST OF PHYCHE-POWER POP!,"I'm trying to remember what link I was reading when I first found out about this band. Well, that isn't important. What is important is the music. Now, I'll tell you right now, I'm a sucker for 60's inspired music. I know there are critics who say the new stuff is good, but it's been done before, and the original stuff is better. Maybe... This is a groovy blast from the past--psychedelic pop rock of the first order. Words like 'power trio' and 'Nuggets' come to mind. Powerful, explosive drumming-- at times the drum sounds remind me of Ringo circa 'Abbey Road.' Crunchy, distorted guitar, the sort of sound you recall from the old 60's vinyl you cherish. OK, what else can I say? BUY THIS DISC NOW!"
4,"Mellower than ""Doorway To Norway"", but still an awesome CD.","I was blown away by ""Doorway To Norway"" when I heard it-- hook-ladden psychedelic-y rock, and when I heard that their new CD was being released, I was really excited. And then I listened to ""The Quiet Vibration Land"", and-- well, I'd be lying if I said that I wasn't a *little* let-down after the first time I heard it, because it's a much more mellow sounding CD than ""Doorway to Norway"". In nearly every mention I've seen of Oranger in the press, a Beach-Boys influence has been brought up at one point or another, and while I didn't really see it before, it is more apparent on ""The Quiet Vibration Land"".Even though they've moved in a different direction with this CD, one thing hasn't changed-- Oranger's ability to write incredibly catchy songs. ""The Quiet Vibration Land"" is no exception. If you've liked their previous stuff, you'll like this-- just don't approach it expecting to hear the sort of stuff you heard on ""Doorway To Norway""."
2,a pretentious weezer,"i assume that this cd will appeal to people who like sloan and that sort of stuff, perhaps even fans of elliott smith might stretch this way. for my money, though - well, i wish i had the sixteen bucks i spent on this thing back, frankly. they're perfectly competent musicians, even handy with a harmony (a la weezer), but the lyrics and vocals lack any sort of spark, and the instrumentation has about as much dynamic potential and depth as ""the family circus"" comic strip. not bad, just dull."
4,Magnetic tip makes all the difference,"Klein magnetic tip nut drivers are simply the best. As a HVAC tech, I use these drivers every day. The magnetic tips set them apart from all other nut drivers."
5,Stoner 91384 Bead Max,"Amazon carries just about everything we need and deliveries are always quick. Husband is getting tired and too old to wax the vehicles the hard way and he is really impressed with Stoner 91384 Bead Max Premium Auto Wax. He did our Motorhome, two cars and a motorcylce with one can and was happy with the results. Only wish that it could be purchased by the case for a cheaper price like another Stoner product we order."
1,About 20% useful,"I'm a college professor and two of my advisees studied this book before taking the Ed Psych CLEP. They both agreed that this text was only useful for about 20% of the questions. Most questions on the CLEP test they took were not covered by this study guide, so my students were frustrated and angry over the time they had wasted studying this text."
2,THIS CLEP STUDY GUIDE DOES NOT CUT THE MUSTARD!,"I have taken almost every CLEP test and have used REA study guides many times before. This CLEP study guide for Introduction to Educational Psychology cover less than half of the material on the actual exam. Now if you read all of the reviews on this page you will read all kinds of different things. Some of the earlier reviews seem to say that this CLEP test is a slam dunk if you study this review. It may be that the questions on the actual CLEP test have somehow been updated because this book does not cover the material on the current CLEP test all. If you have never taken a CLEP test before you might want try an easier CLEP test first such as Principles of Marketing so that you can have success on your very first CLEP test. If you keep taking CLEP tests like these and keep flunking them when you finally do pass a CLEP test you are going to feel like Thomas Edison when he invented the light bulb after 10,000 unsuccessful tries."
3,Waste of Money and Time -- Disappointed!,"I took the test today, I didn't pass! I'm extremely disappointed I bought this book. I studied this book faithfully for 2wks. As several other reviews stated, this book only covers 20% of the actual material on the test. Do not waste your money. Make sure the prep you use is officially Endorsed by College Board afterall, they make up the test. This book is not Endorsed by them."
2,CJ,"This product has really good looking stones, the band is bad. I sent the first one back after 3-1/2 wks it was turning. The second one is just as bad. I am going to try & have a band make to put the stones in."
2,Not visually appealing,"To be inspired to cook, I like to have a well presented cookbook with a photo of each dish. I didn't find this book very inspiring for two reasons. Firstly, although the cover photo is very appealing, the photos inside the book are fuzzy. It looks like they were taken using the kind of fuzzy photographic filter which was fashionable in the 90s. I find this style really irritating. Secondly, the print is very small, and uncomfortable to read. These factors may not bother some people, but for me they really spoilt the book. I gave this book 2 stars as the recipes seemed easy, and the basic explanations for cooking techniques are good."
2,waste of money and pellets,"The price online was pretty low, but S&H was so high. It all added up to more than $10 for tiny scoop. And it does not work for my kittens : either practically everything falls thru, including waste, if middle part is used. or everything, excluding dust from pellets, stays in it . I ended up using corner of my old regular scoop. Product was useless for me."
1,Junk,The holes in this scoop are way too large - they let everything through. I've tried using it multiple times and crap/sawdusty litter always falls through the holes. Also - how does this thing cost $8.00 to ship?? What a ripoff. Stay away.
2,HOLES ARE TOO SMALL,"Holes are too small for feline pine to sift through - the litter gets stuck in the holes!!A CHEAP ALTERNATIVE: use a box cutter to cut out every other prong from the plastic litter scoop you already have. I have four scoops from the dollar store with every other plastic bit cut out and all of them work better than this scoop. I purchased this product because I thought it would look nicer or work better. I regret my vanity.If you want this product anyway, check a pet store - I only paid $4.99 and this current listing asks $8 for shipping alone!"
4,Nice scoop for your kitty poop,We got this through the reward program and it is very nice. The only downside is that smaller pieces will fall through the wide slots and have to be carefully picked up with the smaller-slotted front portion.
1,Poor substitute!,"Ok, how many other people have ordered the GREEN wide slot scoop and received the YELLOW not-so-wide-slot scoop? I've had the real thing and this is NOT it. The photo shows the green scoop which works great with Feline Pine original litter. However, what I received (twice!) was the yellow one that's nothing more than a crappy knock off. I gave it a try anyway and then decided to reorder. No luck - I got the same thing. This time it's going back. I also cancelled my order of Feline Pine litter because without the proper scoop, the litter is a hassle to deal with. I'm very disappointed with Amazon. Until now I've never received anything that wasn't described or pictured accurately."
1,Worthless,"Not even remotely large enough slots for the feline pine to go through. Also, I received a bright, ugly yellow version of this. Very disappointed."
1,"Put simply, does not work.","I do prefer the Feline Pine litter to the clay litters, however it's been a real struggle looking for a scoop that works. This product was a nice idea in theory, but in action does not work at all. The idea is to let the sawdust fall through without wasting the pine chips, however the slots in this scoop are wide enough to let everything through. No bueno."
5,Best romance novel of all time...wish I could give it seven stars,"Anne and Christy are soooo wonderful. This is a book I read over and over. It's perfect, wonderful, deeply moving. The characters are so human, and their love story will stay with you forever. Don't miss!!!"
5,Great!,Awesome product! Works fabulously! Thank you for such an efficient and worth-while apparatus for my geckos! They sure do appreciate it!
2,"Good idea, poor function","Compared to Exo Terra's analog gauges, this product is really far off. It's constantly reading my ball python's cage as too cool and not humid enough. I'd say stick to the analog ones."
1,This item is a JOKE,"This item is a POS. Looks great, but way, way off, by as much as 8 degrees. The hygrometer is a little bit better but not much. Find something else. This will be returned."
1,not recieved yet,"hoping it will be in by today. All my items were purchased on the same day but obviously different sellers, as some get it out right away and some do not, as they are not even close to coming in the same time. So basically still waiting and waiting and waiting."
2,Very variable.,"Nice size and appearance; easy to read and use; nice functions. I bought six of these, but found them extremely variable between units. Over two degrees temperature difference and 3% humidity difference between the six units. They are labeled for use in reptile/amphibian terrariums, so perhaps in this environment a little variability doesn't matter. I would not recommend them for inside incubators where accuracy is more critical."
2,It's just a Fluke!,"There's a reason this Hygrometer is called Fluker's, because it's a ""Fluke"" if you can get one that actually works. With their lack luster customer service, you are better off getting the Caliber III digital hygrometer/thermometer from Western Humidor and be done with it or at bare minimum get a Hygroset II thats adjustable."
5,Accurate & small,"Others have noted that they got units which didn't agree, making the accuracy suspect. Mine is spot-on in agreement with a higher-end electronic humidification unit that is calibrated to 70% for a cigar humidor. The unit is very small and works well in a travel humidor as well as the larger ones."
1,Defective,This fluker's things is not durable.. after a month of using the display is totally not working!!!
5,AWESOME,"Product arrived in a timely manor, felt like it came overnight. Recieved awesome customer service, the personalized letter makes you feel as if you're speaking with Elayne herself. I will definetly purchase from All that by Elayne again!!!"
2,Does not last long,"I bought this amp with my headset back in March 2005 and already it stops working. There is no tone coming through the headset and I am really disappointed with the quality of this unit. I'll try to get Plantronic to take a look, but who really needs the hassle? Granted it is used daily in a office environment, but at the price this unit costs, I expect it to work properly in such setting. Instead, it is just another piece of cheap electronic."
3,Works only with Plantronics headset,"This amp may be ""universal"" with respect telephones, but it is not universal with respect to headsets. This will work only with a Plantronics headset with a proprietary ""quick disconnect"" jack. In other words, it will not work with a standard 2.5mm headset jack. I wish I'd known that before I purchased."
2,Mr.,This is the third Plantronics that I have purchased. I am quite disappointed in the product. It is very difficult to set up and even after that it does a poor job of amplification and creates a buzz or background. I have tried to adjust each one an am very dissatified.Mike Kidder
2,recording quality is not satisfactory,I heard the title works PHLEGRA from other recording. The recording quality is bad and performance is also not exciting than other recording even though both of that performed by ST-X ensemble. The last recording that contains xenakis own words is interesting.
4,Gorgeous Electronica/80s Pop/Gaelic Melodies,I discovered this Minneapolis group via MP3.com and have been suitably impressed with Super Powers and Cape Canaveral to place an order for the full (though slim) disc. Ethereal in the way that Clannad and Maire Brennan combine new age airiness with a feeling of ancient folk mysticism. Looking forward to discovering what more the group can do with this sound and direction.
2,Just OK,"Well, these are just OK. Jellybelly should stick to making jellybeans.I guess if you want a gummy jellybelly, you will like these. They dont taste like normal gummy bears. They are also a little too gummy, and expensive.I recommend the haribro Gold Bears, those are the best!!!"
3,Good but had high expectations,"When I first learned of powerful blenders such as Vitamix and Blendtec, I wanted the best at a decent price. I had high expectations for this blender however I found it does the same job as my $100 blender. Don't get me wrong, this product is good, but I wanted more. I can't chop veggies without them turning to mush. Making natural nut butters is not as easy as I thought it would be. I should have saved my money and stuck with my other blender because I constantly pull it out to do the job I wanted this blender to do. On top of that, the blender jar is plastic and very expensive. For the price I wish they would have a glass jar."
5,You will use it more than you think you will.,"I bought the unit a couple of months ago thinking that I would make smoothies once in a while. I do. I also use it to mill flax, grind pepper, liquify onions and garlic for recipes (my kids hate finding any onion in their food). I even made pate in it. But not only do I use it but the kids use it at least two or three times a day for smoothies or shakes. So far, no complaints and the novelty has NOT worn off. It makes a great iced cappucino too! Make margaritas like the pros!Its a lot of money, but I think its worth it. I've tried the vitamix 5000 and prefer the blendtec."
1,MR SMOOTHIE,"I bought a Blendtec and used it for about 2 weeks then sent it back. What a disaster! I love making my own nut butters and with the Blendtec it is such a pain. I have also noticed that is is horrible blending frozen fruit and whole fruits. I have a friend that used to own a Jamba Juice and they used to use Blendtec but had so many problems they went strictly with a Vita-Mix. I saw the Vita-Mix demo at a Costco and realized why all the smoothie shops use them. They are so much more durable, versitile, and easy to use. They circulate better, their warranty is so much better and their customer service is better. I have been using the Vita-Mix for years now and I love it. I use it everyday! It is the best machine I have ever bought"
5,The Total Blender is the best!,"[...]Their friendly service and blender comparison chart won me over. This blender has been a blessing. I make my own nut milks, soups, smoothies and even nut butters. It is a little loud but not as loud as my Vitamix blender. I use my Total Blender almost everyday and my kids are begriming to use it. It's really easy and fast to clean and is very durable and powerful. I just can't live without it. Highly recommended. :-)"
2,Bent blade shaft in jar,"For a $400 blender I was expecting a product to outlive me given the rating on Amazon of this product being of commercial grade and able to blend ice cubes into powder. It worked as advertised however through six months of use the blade shaft came loose then eventually jammed, rendering the jar useless. Blendtec refused to replace the jar given I had had it for 13 months."
3,square tapered blender is stupid design,"See title. This is the dumbest design I have ever seen or used. It works ok mostly, but stuff will get ""stuck"" in the corners sometimes and not get blended well, requiring longer blending times. The larger top portion is problematic in the same way. Stuff will sit up there near the edges because of the horizontal edge at the top. Maybe they know what they are doing. I'm not a mechanical or fluids engineer. All I can say is it doesn't seem to work as good as it could. It also blends a lot of air into the mix becuase of the stupid design. I will say its pretty sturdy and has held up well after 1242 cycles, only having to replace the carafe. I want to get a Vitamix though and compare, hopefully selling this one."
3,Ok.,"Do not attempt to put this together with simply a screwdriver. Get a drill and a driver. Much easier.Relatively easy to put together, but the base of it should be sturdier in my opinion. The drawers aren't huge, but it is functional.The customer service is very friendly but SLOW. It took me three days to finally put this together. (If you are searching for an answer to the ""where to put the screw on the drawer hardware,"" the answer is this: it's ok not to put it in the same place as the picture. You're welcome.)I'd buy it again, but I'm not crazy about it."
2,not what I expected...,"First off, the cover is the OLD cover of the book. what I recieved after I ordered it was a newer edition with a section of how to find gold. I didn't want the new version after I recieved it. I wanted the OLD version which was more relevant to what I was doing. I lost my old version in a move and ordered this one thinking it was the old version. it was not. try switching the cover to the newer version. and for gods sake get rid of the gold chapter, if I wanted to read about finding gold I would buy a gold book not a surfboard book."
1,Videowonderland lemon !,Do not buy the DVD Bichunmoo from Videowonderland . What they represent is not what you get. No Korean language and no English subtitles. I got a English speaking copy and the packaging is different from what is posted on Amazon.
5,Amazing Movie,"I watched this movie in amazement--it was spectacularly beautiful in some scenes--there is no other way to describe it except that it's like an anime movie come to life (solo scenes of the wind blowing through the main character's hair, etc.). The movie also seemed to blend together Korean, Chinese, and Japanese influences, which also made it interesting. It is full of intense and fantasy-like martial arts fighting scenes, but the love story is what truly holds the plot together."
2,"Damn, another over-rated movie(don't let this happen to you)","""Just skip foward to the fightin scenes"" - you might be telling yourself this when you try to watch this movie again and again. Only the fighting scenes makes this movie come alive- the main character has a style of slicing multiple enemies from a distance(and the enemies don't really get sliced, they just have smoke & dust exploding from their torsos). You may like this film if you enjoyed the movie, DEADFUL MELODY, because it has a simple plot,poor dialog, poorly-executed story, yet dazzling fighting scenes. But DEADFUL MELODY makes this film look like a amateur/student film.And if you like CROUCHING TIGER HIDDEN DRAGON, HERO, and HOUSE OF FLYING DAGGERS, dont get this movie! BICHUNMOO has a decent romance story in it but it is not well executed as these movies."
2,not that great..,the only reason i watch this movie is because i need to see Kim HeeSun in traditional Korean costume..coz she's mad FOINE! storywise...this's not more then a hero saving damsel in distress kind...very dissappointing since i heard so much good reviews about it. the action scenes are not that bad though...since they hired HongKong martial artists/stuntmen to cheograph & body double all the fights. i know this coz i happened to watch some clips of the making....and trust me Crouching Tiger is wayyy worth watching.
4,romance and fighting what more could you ask for,"I thought this movie was pretty cool and the fighting reminded me of the legendery swordsman movie. The storyline was'nt all that but that didnt affect the movie much. Overall I think this is the best movie to come out of korea yet,well at least it better than that dumb movie ""nowhere to hide"". Take my word for if you want a movie with romance and fighting together this is a keeper, i should know i saw it at my friends' house , he had the tape version."
2,man this movie sucked,"The claim to be the highest budget film in Korean history did nothing to help this movie. The fight scenes were unimpressive, the story is basic revenge deal and lots characters are underdeveloped so you don't really miss them when they are killed."
3,Good plot & twists. Childish fight scenes. Very depressing.,"The plot is complicated. It covers many kinds of relationship: spouses, friends, siblings, parents and their children.The title indicates exactly what the fighting looks like. The characters DANCED with their swords, they did not fight at all.After their swords banged against each other 2 or 3 times, their bodies would explode into pieces or their hands and heads would be chopped off.The mood is very sad from the beginning till the end. If you like to weep watching a movie, this is for you. I prefer Musa (another Korean Movie). Its fighting scenes are on par with top Hong Kong action films."
2,Horrible korean film,"This sucked in everyway possible the storyline is horrible and its incredibly CONFUSING characters pop in and out, and this movie looks like a low budget film from the early 90s a few guys carry plastic swords and if you pay close attention you can notice the wires on two or three occasions so much for claiming to be the highest budget korean film.i bought this movie thinking that it was a smart, stylish love story but dont let the nice dvd cover fool you this movie is mostly bad fighting the bodies explode after getting sliced, so ridiculous. This movie is perfect for teenagers or if you just want a mindless action film, if you want a good korean movie then buy ""musa:the warrior"" instead."
2,DANCE WITH SWORD PUT ME TO SLEEP!,"I thought after reading the good reviews that this film would be up to par alongside such epics as Crouching Tiger/Hidden dragon, Musa the warrior, and HERO - BOY was that wrong!!This had a lot going for it, but was just dragging along with cheesey old fashioned action sequences. Yuch!!The love story took forever, and after awhile, I could care less! If you like slow-paced, slogging thru mud storylines, along with chincy action sequences - then this one's for you!Me? I'll stick with the better made movies, such as AZUMI and the 7 Samurai, just to name a couple more..."
3,Write-protect switch ineffective for USB,"This is a neat concept. I actually purchased it for a particular and unusual application, in which we needed the write-protect switch. We discovered that the switch does make the card read-only when accessed as an SD card, but still allowed writes when accessed as a USB flash drive. Unfortunately, that made it unsuitable for our purposes.I gave the card to a photog friend of mine, and he was happy with it.But consider also that you can get a SD card reader that plugs into a USB port and isn't much bigger than a SD card. You could use that one card reader for any number of regular -- and lower-priced -- SD cards. And you wouldn't have to worry about breaking the hinge or anything like that.So while I wouldn't call this a bad product, there may be more cost-effective solutions."
3,Very good book but with errors and repetitions,"Geraldine Norman has written a very interesting short history of a very immense museum. She keys in on many of the interesting highlights but all too often she repeats information already given in an earlier chapter. However, the most confusing error comes on page 94 when she talks about the Basilewski collection being sold to Russia in 1884 and being viewed by ""...the wife of Woodrow Wilson, the American President."" Strange, Wilson Wilson was not elected President until 1912. Also, a map showing the overall layout of the museum identifying the various building stages would have been very helpful."
2,Not what I expected....,"The alarm automatically shuts itself off after an hour, however, if you let it shut off by itself, you have to reset the clock again, it will not go off the next morning, even if the alarm button is set.The battery back up has worked when my power was out for a few hours, but when I lost power for 4 days, the back up didn't work."
4,From an Indigo's perspective...,"A helpful book for those who wish to REALLY understand why their children are different. For those who cannot accept that, the truth will remain the truth to your children no matter what you wish to think. The book might have been more useful if it were written by ACTUAL Indigo Children--how are the readers to understand a forgien concept if it does not come directly from the source? No one is suggesting ALL INDIGO CHILDREN ARE FROM OUTER SPACE! The book may offer different explanations for the Children that not all might care for, but it does reveal many of the relevant facts that cannot be denied."
1,Somebody needs to lay off the psychotropic drugs.,"This should be classified as fantasy or perhaps folklore, not psychology or counseling. Seriously, the traits of the ""indigo child"" are also shared by children whose parents were more concerned about being their buddies than being good parents. The authors fail to prove anything (except that they've found a comfortable way to make a few $$)."
1,Our children come from another planet?,"This is a very strange book which asserts that these children are called Indigo because one author sees them as the color blue and they come from another planet. There are several essays which make no sense at all. Some of the essays are well written, but the information provided is nothing new. When you finsh this book, if you read it all, you are left thinking that the writers have lost touch with reality.lost touch with reality."
1,Not a good book on ADD,"As a parent of child with ADD, I have read a great deal of material about children with these types of problems. Unfortunately, this book was very disappointing in its discussion of these issues. The definition of an indigo child was confusing and incoherent. The suggestions for discipline didn't begin to touch on the special needs for these children and things that really can be done to help them. Some of the essays negated research findings without providing any evidence. For example, research has shown for a long time that diet doesn't impact ADD. This was disproved by numerous studies over 30 years ago. This book reflects the feeling of some people on these issues. It has some really far out ideas, like these children come from another planet. I don't believe my daughter comes from another planet. She is a beautiful gift from God, and there are lots of resources out there to help her and others like her. But this book isn't one of them."
3,I expected something more substantial...,"I do believe we are living the indigo children era. However, I think the book brings just a superficial view of the subject. It's a simple compilation of testimonials. It could have gone deeper on the indigo's phenomenon and its spiritual characteristics."
4,Hillarious load of claptrap,"THIS BOOK IS A JOKE, PEOPLE!! Honestly, before you go buying this sublimely hilarious lampoon of cultish, new-age child-raising remember that it is NOT A GUIDE FOR RAISING CHILDREN WITH TROUBLE LEARNING, it is a joke, and a very clever, subtle one at that. Sorry to blow the whole joke people but seriously, working parents whose kids have learning disabilities shouldn't go wasting their hard-earned money on a joke at their expense. ""The Indigo Children"" is good for a laugh but parents, there are lots of real books and real experts out there that can really help you and your kids. This book contains no real info, think of it as the ""Spinal Tap"" of the self-help world."
1,for parents who don't want to set limits: authors get rich,"Now we have a New Age, pseudopsychological explanation for why kids who are not taught any limits act up in school. I recommend books by Alfie Kohn for some real information on raising kids with loving kindness AND limits who will know how to make it in the Real World where not everyone will share Mommy's view that Johnny is a gift from god, and more special than other kids.What a disservice to parents and children!"
1,One crazy book,"If you have a child with ADD or ADHD, this book will waste your time. Do you believe that your child is from outer space and a space alien? If so, read this book. This is a very strange book for people who must be really nuts! Unable to accept their children for what they are, they believe that they are from outer space! My child has ADHD, but my child is very much human! If you want realistic down to earth advice, look somewhere else. This book is from outer space!"
1,"If you're into Aura's, give it another star","Poorly written, the author's are in love with exclamation points. You have to be into New-Agey ""aura's"" to even begin to like this book. Any advice offered is just common sense I used while parenting my children anyway. Save your money. If you're having trouble with a child, I recommend Mary Sheedy Kurcinka's ""Raising Your Spirited Child"" instead."
1,Complete garbage,"This is an utter and total waste of time and money. Be real to yourself and your child, get some professional advice, not this pathetic drivel."
1,I hate this book,"I hate this whole idea. I'm so tired of new agers sitting around doing nothing waiting for someone else to do all the work and save them. It's pathetic.I also hate how this author wants to neatly categorize people into tiny little boxes and put one neat little label on them. Just the idea that an entire generation could be summed up in 1 sentence is insulting to any intelligent human being.Am I an indigo kid? I don't know. I'm certainly in the age group and I certainly have a complete lack of respect for authority. I know who I am. I also can't stand hypocrisy and people who won't get things done for themselves. I am exceedingly empathic and can read people like a book, even over the internet. But I do not have ADD. I'm not here on some mission as a vanguard for a buncha little kids. I'm not here to save humanity from anything. Humanity should save itself. I have patience.This book is just another example of a broken new ager praying that someone will tell her what to do."
1,A disappointment,"As a mother of a child with ADD, I was looking for fresh ideas and insight. I wanted tips for parenting, methods for understanding, and real ideas that might help. This book did not fulfill any of my goals. The main goal of this book is to sell the idea that these children come from another planet. There are no new tips or ideas in how to help these children. Although there is preaching about not using medication. My suggestion is that if you want real help, look somewhere else!"
3,Unsatisfying,"Though this book is filled with sound advice for parents, I was hoping for more evidence of qualitative differences regarding the ""indigo' phenomeneon. However, only testimonials were offered. I found no differentiation regarding modern children contrasted to precocious children of the past. A great book for one who needs a book to figure out that their child is special."
5,Fantastic book,"The Indigo Children By: Lee Carroll and Jan Tober***** (5 stars)I love this book, it made me think and gave me great new facts and information. Lee Carroll and Jan Tober wrote this book about indigo children. Indigo children are spiritual, inelegant and special.One of my favorite chapters of this book is when a woman meets her niece and comes to a shocking conclusion that her 3 year old niece is using rather large words, highly self taught and presents a strong imagination.What I like about the little story inside of the chapter is that it proves that the authors aren't the only ones who notice these outstanding children.I would have liked to hear more from the indigo children themselves rather than hearing from others.I would recommend this book to my little cousin Brett who loves books with information a point and a meaningful message.Aundrea Rogers"
1,Any mother and father has an indigo,"If you want to understand your child read ""The Challenge of Children"". If you want to understand your partner read ""The Challenge of Marriage"". Both are based on the Individual Psychology Theory by Alfred Adler developed 100 years ago. Adler was a doctor in medicine and an expert in children. Scientists who conduct research and practitioners who use his theory and base their practice in science and ethical behabior can be reached by contacting the North American Society of Adlerian Psychology. And this is not the only intervention and child rearing understanding frame of reference with the qualities to assure you are caring for your children and yourself. Invest your money in information and knowledge!"
3,"Misguided, but not All Bad.","This book would be very helpful for a parent whose child has been diagnosed with Attention deficeit Disorder. It offers aternatives to conventional treatment and great resources. Unfortunaltey, it tags these children as part of a spiritual movement and is judgemental towards children that have good results on medication as having ""brain damage."" Interesting in a way, but completely oversimplifies into a deluded attempt to turn children into some kind of celestial saviors. I suggest going to the indigo children webpage and taking the resources without having to buy the book. And if you do decide to buy it, have plenty of salt on hand."
1,A New age book on space aliens,"This book is about a ""trekkie"" new age philosophy toward children. This is not a parent guide on dealing with children. According to the writers, the Indigo children are children from another planet sent to earth to teach us how to love and introduce us into a new age. The ""fine minds"" the back cover describes the writers of these compositions, are believers in a metaphysical philosophy that we have space aliens living among us, mainly our children. This book does not deal with practical parenting issues. It's for ""star trekkies"" and people who believe in aliens and UFOs."
5,"Indigo Children ARE diffrent, special...and they are HERE!","If you are a parent....chances are good that you are parenting an indigo child. It may be difficult for many native Earth vibrations to believe that help has arrived to Earth, and it may not seem like ""help"" at first. Our precious children are masters of Light...no wonder they scoff at our corrupt and blind ""authority"". They will change the world and this book can inform parents how to either help or get out of the way."
1,I believe in angels but........,"First, so you know where I am coming from, I do believe in angels, and in the importance of spiritual development of children. I believe all children are special and we need to learn to understand them. I thought that this book would be helpful. However, there is a mixture of quality in terms of the writing and presentation of ideas. I couldn't figure out what an Indigo child was from the essays. Some were incoherent. Some of the essays were well written, but offered nothing new in terms of a child's spiritual, learning or other development. When it came to the idea that some of these children are from outer space, another planet, I had to draw the line. I believe in God, angels, and spiritual intervention. This book misses the mark."
1,Amazon review does not reveal this book is dangerous.,"From the Wikipedia article:""The Indigo Child concept was first popularized by the book, The Indigo Children, written by the husband and wife team of Lee Carroll and Jan Tober. Carroll also claims to be a channeler for ""Kryon,"" a spiritual entity who predicted the coming of the indigo children.""More info at: http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Indigo_children"
2,no me gusto,no me satisfiso la información del libro como concepto no específicamente del autor creo que hay información mas relevante con respecto a niños hiperactivos
3,Different,"I was not sure what to expect from this book. I found some of the concepts interesting and plausible, however, I find it difficult to understand at many points exactly what the author was trying to get across. It did seem a bit far outside the mainstream for me, but then I cannot dispute or agree with the authors. It does provide a different viewpoint for many of us exasperated parents of these wonderful children with special needs.I don't find this to be any type of cure all, or even offer much advice to those who are living with children who are severely ADD/ADHD, but I do appreciate many of the things they had to say to help me focus on my child as a true individual with a spirit unlike mine.I would suggest getting this from a library before purchasing, just to see if it will be the right type of book for you, your needs and if it will give you an additional perspective into your child."
2,A little disappointed,"Lee Caroll is great and I have enjoyed all the Kryon books. I have been working with challenging children for many years now and I am a little disappointed by the book. Although I am sure that the ""Indigo Child "" phenomenon exists, as I have witnessed it myself in my classroom, I found the book very simplistic and not properly supported by hard facts. Too many comments from people that are deeply into the new age movement talking about their own children being amzingly special..Don't we all think that of our own children? As a worker in the field I was looking forward to something a bit more substancial. Also beware of the ""I am an Indigo Child "" syndrome that seems to be developing in some spiritual circles, with claims of specialness and uniqueness. Aren't we all one? Isn't that what it is all about?"
2,Only an alternative language,This book basically describes the same people that Carl Jung discribed in Psycological Types. If you continue to read you will realize that these children have always been around in about 1%-5% of the population. Think about how society has changed and why these children are currently being labeled then do a little research about children like Einstein. You will find out that society today in general does not desire children like Einstein in our public schools. If you really want to understand your child and help him/her succeed in todays world continue to read and enlarge your languages. I recommend really learning about Myers Briggs Type Indicator and once you have learned the language (yes it's a bitter harder than giving people a color aura) try reading Nurture by Nature by Paul D. Tieger and Barbara Barron-Tieger
2,Picture shown does not accurately depict the item being sold.,"The image shown is of the $100 version of this Neo costume. The one being sold has cheaper material, almost shiny, and it looked like a priest's robe. The company was very good about the return process. 2-stars for customer service, 0-stars for the actual product."
3,handguns mag.,have only recieved one copy to date. i havent seen enough as yet to make a good judgement of the magazine.
1,Way to long!!!,"I ordered this magazine July 3rd and have still not received my first issue,it's October 18th. I will NEVER order from this company again."
5,Hubby loves it!,My husband loves this magazine! I love the look on his face when he gets one through the mail! So glad I ordered it! He's all the time bringing it to me showing me all the new stuff he reads about in the magazine!
2,Do not Order!,"It takes four months until you receive your first issue. I know its only published 6 times a year, but four months?"

5,sign o times by prince,Exellent showmanship! The live performance stands head and shoulders above the rest! The music is fun and captivatingly hypnotic! Great buy!
5,There is a Better Version Available thru Amazon.com Canada,Available at AMAZON.COM Canada. The version availble thru them is digitally remastered in 5.0 and it needless to say is possibly the best Prince Concert film available. Stay away from the Brizilian DVD because the sound and video absolutely stink. Why this dvd is only available thru Amazon Canada and not the USA is beyond me. But if you are a Prince fan this is simply a MUST have and IMHO blows the purple rain concert right out of the water. The music and imagery are just simply supurb. Solid from beginning to end you dont want to miss this one. Get this before it goes out of print and see Prince in one of his best performances.
2,Disappointing quality,"While this is widely recognized as a superb concert movie, the quality of this DVD is very poor. The picture's not great. The sound is appalling."
5,Sign O' The Times...for ALL time!,"Hands down, this is simply one of the greatest concert films ever made. It features Prince when he was at the height of his creativity and the apex of his physical ""dancetivity."" This man is a tornado in concert (even still). If you've never seen Prince live (or even if you have) this movie is really a must. Skip over Michael Jackson's ""This Is It,"" because folks, THIS is it."
5,Un album a couper le souffle.,"Wow... si vous aimer un petit quelque chose de st-germain la poésie. Cet album a un style très Groove, molo, je fond lorsque j'écoute Daniel Bélanger."
1,Not as good as his previous work.,"Daniel Belanger, the ""STING"" of Quebec, with his pure tenor voicals presents to his loyal public yet another collection of low-key introspective songs. Unfortunately, they do not mesure up to the amazing quality of his previous work. This CD is good compared to others on the market, however, should you want a solid francophone CD, then I suggest you select another title from Daniel Belanger's impressive catalogue of work such as ""QUATRE SAISONS""."
5,One of the best to do it.,"If you are a fan of Fred Stoller you'll absolutely love this. I saw this guy on television in the 80's and was hooked.Later I saw other guys who I thought ripped Fred Stoller off, but then he had a spot on the program.I laugh every time I see this."
4,A More Poppy CD,"This album is a little more pop oriented, but it is just as fun as Tub Ring's other albums."
5,Wow,Me and my twin used to not want this because of the price ($14.99- I think!) and now we DEFINATLY want it now!!!!! It's SO cute!!!!! :)! I love the little games and stuff!!!! Those are SO adorable!!!!! I REALLY WANT THIS!!!!!!-TORI-
5,The fun of the Lil Bratz sno fun ski lodge!,"This toy not only shows educational about how to properly dress for snow and what a ski lodge looks like but it really can be interesting expanding the child's imagination. They can think of anything they want and not have to stop if you or they buy the Lil bratz Highschool, Lounging Loft and Mall. It can be 4 things that really expand their imagination."
1,Don't waste your money,"This toy looks very nice in the package, but when you unpack it and start to play, you find it is made like cr*p! The plastic pieces are warped and don't fit right. There is a window that is supposed to open, but it just falls out when you try to open it. The railing on the balcony pops out. a lot of money for a real junky toy"
4,"This is alright, but............",The bigger Bratz ski lodge is better...This one doesn't have much for the lil' Bratz!
3,not that fun,okay the little bratz are not as fun as the normal sized bratz but if you like this kind of thing I reccomend polly pockets they are fun even for me an 11 year old and they are cheaper.
5,best Crackers in the World!,"My Husband & I love this product. They are good with everything from Tuna to soup. I say try them ""You will Love them!"""
1,Doesn't last,"I dont know what the problem is with this toy. It didnt last longer than a week, only days when it stopped clicking - not one toy, but three of them. I am trying to report the problem to Fisher Price. There has to be some problem that it would break that easily with everyday use."
4,I got it cheaper,"I paid $5.00 for this at Menards. I hope it works, if it doesnt, I'll write an additional comment. My 14 yr. old is giving them to my grands for Christmas."
1,"Don't buy, breaks within a day","Like the other reviewers, I found that this cheap View-Master broke within a day. Too bad, because the binocular design is a cute update on the traditional View-Master. I bought the Discovery View-master with the sounds and have been very happy with it."
1,DONT BUY - BREAKS THE FIRST DAY,I have purchased two of these form my son and they have lasted only one day. I tried to report the problem to fisher price via email but they have no link to contact them. You have to do it by phone during normal business hours when I am working. Ridiculous!
1,Not Workable,"I just purchased this viewmaster at Pamida ... opened it when I got home and it would not work. Went back to the store, where there were two more on the shelf. Neither of them worked. What's going on with Fisher Price? I had checked this style of viewmaster at Wal-Mart also, and could not find any in working condition. I certainly am not going to purchase another one since it seems apparant there is some kind of problem that needs to be addressed!"
5,Great cop caper,"A cop novel by a Long Island cop, the first of two in the series, so far as I know. The sequel is The Honor Farm. Very funny, yet dark, and quite moving. A movie based on EXIT WOUNDS is coming, and crime fans who might have missed this book get one more chance to meet Police Officer Orin Boyd (Steven Seagal)up close and personal. They should take it."
3,It's OK but not perfect,"I bought this to mount a DLink DGS-1024 Gigabit 24 port switch in my Leviton structured media enclosure. It works. There are little wing-nuts that let the bracket clamp on whatever product you are trying to hold. In my case, the bracket needs to be opened up all the way in order to clamp on the 24-port switch.When you open the bracket all the way up, the little black push-rivets are not accessable. Like I said, it works but it is also a very clumbsy product. I'll keep it because I bought it sight unseen. Had I been able to fiddle with one in-hand before buying, I would have found something else."
4,a fine recording,"Is ""Sleepin' With the Dogs"" a listenable CD? Yes, it is very listenable. I have seen/heard Rane Nogales and her band in person, and this recording more than does justice to her heartfelt, skillful song craft and her tight-knit (though not up-tight) players. Her original pieces elliptically contain life stories worthy of repeated listening to draw out their subtly woven layers of meaning. And, while you're at it, your ears will thank you for the sonic pleasure."
4,"Cool, Smooth, groovy and healing","This music is smooth, cool, romantic, bluesy groovy, and jazzy too. Rane's songs and her quality musicians send a mist of joy that lingers on and makes you want to hear these sweet sounds again and again. Beautiful and Healing. I recommend it to anyone with a heart."
2,Not the most up to date book,"This outdated, massive volume is really of no use to anyone other than archivists, collectors, or someone who, for whatever reason, might find the history of hospital employee health programs captivating."
1,"Unfortunately, I fell for the design","The look of this radio is the only positive thing on which I can comment. The stations are difficult to tune in, and drift in and out. You can be tuned to a station one minute, and literally 10 minutes later lose it, ending up with nothing but static. Frustrating. The sound is basic as well, even with the low expectations I had.I also was another one who could not find any television stations (though I did read this was an issue in a prior review). I have logged on tonight to buy another radio and really should return this one since I only got it a few weeks ago. I recommend this product if you only want to look at it, but not turn it on."
2,TV reception is not good,I bought this radio mainly to listen to television while working.With some effort we can find the station but listen to them is not easy.You have to use full volume and this mean low volume to your ears. I have tried others radios and brands with the TV sound feature and they all work poorly. Perhaps a Digital one can deliver more volume but they are expensive. At the price I recoment this PHILIPS since if you are in a quiet room it may be useful.Mario.
2,Elementary,This is a very elemental work. Did not contain the historical detail I was expecting based on the description of the work. This would be OK for a Sunday School study but don't expect an in depth discussion of characters or events.
2,Not the book I was hoping for,"I can't imagine how difficult it is to write a book, but this book was not what I hoped it would be. I frequently teach adult Sunday School and I had high expectations that this book would allow me to teach a series of Sunday School lessons without the amount of background work that I often do for a class in addition to such books. However, I was disappointed. This book looks just did not come through as I hoped. It just is not sufficient for my lessons. I gave up on this book and went back to old fashion work with my Bible and commentaries. I do not recommend this book for adult Sunday School teachers."
4,Excellent book enjoyable to read and keeps your attention,"Reading this book as part of my school curriculum. This book is so amazing I don't want to put it down. I struggle understanding the old testament, it is dry and sometimes hard to inturpret...but this book reads like a novel.It really draws you into the OT characters and connects it to our current life events. This definitely draws you in, keeps your attention and keeps you wanting to read more. Awesome entertaining book while educating you in bible history. I will keep this book to read again and again."
3,Uncle John's,These books make good gifts for someone you don't know that well. If you have a surprise person stop by on Christmas a book like this is a nice last minute gift.
5,Simply beautiful,"Who can disagree when it comes to Schubert??? Purchase it, play it, enjoy it...great music by great musicians. The Notturno is my favorite...."
1,the worst book i have ever read,"this book is an incredible waste of time. contrary to popular belief, there is NOT a book in EVERYONE.save your money"
2,Not impressive,"I was very disappointed with this book. As a long time fan, I learned nothing new here. In fact, probably any average fan could write a similar book. In additon,the author has an annoying habit of trying to be funny by insulting practically everyone George ever worked with continuously throughout the book. I'm still waiting for a good biography on George."
1,I wish I hadn't purchased,"I couldn't get past his spiteful, sarcastic writing style. Too many attacks on other people. Is this the truth or incredibly biased reporting?"
5,Pondering Nature,"Most of us do not spend our days thinking about the magic of nature. In fact, it is rare that we stop and wonder at the unique qualities of life and evolution. This book is a collection of short essays which seem to take a walk through nature, pondering its interesting and beautiful idiosyncrasies. Without going into too much detail, Eiseley helps us to stop and look at the seemingly small things and understand their vast importance. This is not a complicated book designed for naturalists, but a fairly straightforward and engaging book for those who simply enjoy nature. A high school student interested in studying anthropology or environmental science in college would be wise to read this as inspiration."
5,Eisely is a must read!,"I was introduced to Loren Eisely in a graduate class on Scientists and their Essays. The Eisely book in the course was (of course) The Star Thrower. It is astounding how many scientist create such thought provoking writings that are not related to the fields in which they practice. A few years after reading The Star Thrower, I became a public school teacher and I look at a sea of starfish every single day and hope that I never quit trying to return them to the ocean!"
5,A Must-Read,"This is one of my all-time favorite books. Eisely makes me dizzy sometimes with his beautifully and entertainingly written evocations of archeological time. He was amazingly precient in seeing where our population explosion would lead us. The chapter entitled ""The Judgment of the Birds,"" (I think) brings a tear to my eye... and this is a most curmudgeonly writer.I confess I'm an Eisely nut, and have read everything he wrote. For perspective, I also like Richard Russo, Alice Munro, Anne Lamott, Kent Haruf...One more thing: this book makes a great gift for just the right person."
3,scholarly treatment of Darwin's ideas - and textual analysis,"Eiseley has read all of the different editions of ""Origin,"" and in that way traces the evolution of Darwin's thought in the context of his times and in how he re-edited his books as his opinion changed. It is well written and argued and somewhat better than normal academic writing, but it still reads like a pedantic text. Perhaps it was too advanced, or simply too detailed, for the level of my interest, but I found a lot of this somewhat boring - and I admit that that is as personal as a reflection on the text. Eiseley is a world-class science writer, up there with Sagan and Gould, and explains with great clarity, etc. You get to know Darwin's mind, his many doubts, and the way he constantly hedged and worried about his reception.Recommended with this in mind. It really depends on what you are looking for."
2,"Vague, Disappointing","Eiseley essentially drafts the story of evolution, with personal observations thrown in, but in a style I found maddening. I guess he didn't want it to sound like a textbook so he laced the book with poetic-sounding sentences and vague references. Half the time I didn't know what he was talking about and had to re-read the sentence or paragraph several times. Eiseley has a strange way of writing, as if he's trying to make the subject matter more fascinating than it is. However the story of evolution is fascinating enough. He shoulda just played it straight and let the story tell itself."
2,Anthropologist or Literary Hall of Famer?,"This book can quite simply be summed up in a few words: A storyof evolution... I admit that I was required as a university studentto read this book, and I have enjoyed the readings that my English class has offered thus far. However, the only people who are going to enjoy this book are absolute Darwinistic evolutionists who enjoy dry reading about how rats are the ""fathers of mankind."" I caught myself asleep several times through this one."
4,Memorial day Remembrance,"I checked out 7 books from the library to read on Memorial Weekend 2000. I chose Art of the Inner Meal to start. It was so wonderful, easy and thought-provking that I never got to the other 6 books. I re-read it the next day and began typing each of the poems, prayers and practices to create a remembrance book of my own. I have already recommended it to a friend who is doing a doctorate in theology and who is an Anglican priest. I am an ex-postulant of a religious order, the ex-wife of a priest and a mother and grand-mother. This book made me rearrange my kitchen. It made me focus on my body and on the food I eat daily. It even invited a healing sensation in my right side which has ben numb for several years.I related totally to the exciting and meditative atmosphere of this work. I thank Mr. Altman for letting me share his adventures into fasting and spirituality. I am grateful indeed. ShalomSylvia Worrell 149 Nw 11th St #17 Miami, Florida 33136-2779"
5,Poetic Reality: Wiowode's World is Wonderful,"This novel, it must be said, is not quite as good as Wiowode's finest, 'Beyond the Bedroom Wall.' But Wiowode's second best is anyone else's excellent. As North Dakota's poet, Wiowode uses prose in stark, image-packed lines to tell the story of two brothers, their respective roads through triumph and tragedy. Though Wiowode is a Christian (Presbyterian), he doesn't flinch as his characters grapple with homosexuality and even sibling experimentation. Alchoholism, a factor in Wiowode's own life, also plays a role, as does the uncharacteristic (for a modern novel) love of parents found almost solely in Wiowode. This is a beautifully-crafted book, a story about faith, sin, lostness, and love. Redemptive, yes. But not cheaply so. Highest recommendation."
4,Mandman? Maybe,"I have read other Katzenbach novels, but this one is very different. I like the style of his writing; he takes the time to fully develop his characters. The plot is slow-moving but I found the descriptive paragraphs engrossing enough to read every word. The word ""sanity"" takes on a new meaning in this story. And the very subtle intertwining of reality and illusion plus switching from past to present sets this novel apart from your common ordinary suspense thriller. Is this ""madman"" really mad? Take the time to read this absorbing novel and decide for yourself."
4,A really great read!,"I really like the suspense! Towards the end, I couldn't put the book down because I was dying to know ""who did it"". I thought the characters were brought to life fabulously. Felt like I knew all of them. The writing was good and I liked how the story line went from the present to the past."
2,Too much description,"Ive read several katzenbach books, and the analyst is one of my favorite books of all time. However, The Madmans Tale was too slow. Really good premise, but he was too descriptive and it seemed like he was trying to lengthen the book. I skipped through a lot of paragraphs."
2,Like bad sex,I read this book on vacation and found it to be intersting enough not to put down but kept hopeing it would get better or have some great twist (involving the main character) at the finish. I was expecting a lot from the ending but was sadly let down. It was alright (I didn't throw it away) but could have been better.
3,I need to be locked up to finish this,Too much for too little a payoff. The author writes more and delivers less.
2,"Not what I expected.....Slow, boring....","After reading and liking the Analyst, I picked up the madman's tale. I found it slow, boring, a little confusing....The 100 pages were good....."
1,Bad writing and no plot,"This is my first Katzenbach novel, and my last. I enjoy the tight writing and characters of Michael Connelly and Dennis Lehane. Aside from a fairly intriguing first chapter, the rest of the writing here was a complete disappointment. Way too much internal thought process with overwrought emotion, e.g. ""Will I ever love again?"" and the like. I started reading the first line of every paragraph and skipping the rest. I finish everything I start so I did get to the end to see if there was a payoff in plot, but no."
3,good book if nothing better shows up,"THis is the second bok I've read from this author, so I'm not a fan but the book in some parts was too long. The main character is great, but the story was not good enough for me to recommend it."
3,Was I the only one fooled?,"I thought for sure half way through the book I had figured out who the ""Angel"" was.If so it would have been an interesting twist and kept me reading all the way through to the end to see how the author would wrap it all up. I don't want to give it away but the ending was very anticlimatic with the realization of who the ""angel"" was. I had put up with all the unbelievable aspects of this ""tale"" just to get to a satisfying end and was let down. I did enjoy the characters of the various patients in the asylum but overall the book seemed too LONG."
3,Mostly disappointed,"I read this because I had read Katzenbach's ""The Analyst"", and while that book was a little long it was interesting enough to hold my interest and I liked the entire story. This one had the same problem of being too long, but this time the story didn't support the length. The best thing I can say is that some of the characters are fairly well drawn and memorable, but the book is way too long to sustain suspense and the end was letdown."
1,Disappointing,"Way too many words -- especially adverbs and adjetives. It's as though the editing process was skipped in the rush to publish. The premise of the plot is intriguing but it becomes increasingly unbelievable as it goes along. For a while I wondered if that was an intended part of the plot, given that it takes place in an asylum. By page 345 I no longer cared. I rarely give up on a book in mid-read, but I did in this case."
1,a confusing totally unbelievable farrago,"I read it to the end hoping, in vain, for some clarity to this overwrought, confusing and completely unrealistic ""thriller"". Way too many words about events that in even in these days of medical errors, hospital mistakes etc. are inconceivable. It was a waste of time, money and effort."
3,The Problem with Authenticity,"The Eastman-Dryden ensemble continue their Victor Herbert series but not with a great advance on previous issues. Orchestral playing is efficient but somewhat lifeless, even mechanical. The arrangements are contemporary pot-pourris of tunes from various Herbert shows, while Teresa Ringholz (Eastman-Dryden's apparently resident soprano) is a pure voiced if uninspiring coloratura in the 'Marietta' excerpts. When will we ever get a proper full-length studio recording of this definitive American operetta? Come on, Americans, show a bit more pride in your cultural heritage. Until then, if you want Victor Herbert, you are much better off buying the issues on Marco Polo."
4,The great American songsmith,"Herbert was a great songwriter. Most of his operettas were classic.This CD is a good sampling of his music. Badinage is a great tune and you will recognize the melody if you have a liking for good American classical music. Even if you dig rock music like I do, you can enjoy listening to this."
4,Road to WWII,afair liook @ events leading up to WWII Could have arranged in carlinder orter muh better to much skipping between yrs
3,Nice read overall,"This is a neat book in that there are several time lines unfolding to the reader. The present, the past for the characters and the past of the people in the photograph. It begins with Claire and her estranged husband, Joshua digging up a photograph of people who look exactly like them, but from over a century ago. It's mystery forces them together, something they haven't done in over 5 years, since the death of their son. As the three time lines intermingle the hero and the heroine grow closer again, in ways that their younger selves were unable to due to immaturity and situations.All in all it is very enjoyable and has two great supporting characters in Sarge and Wilma. The ending is a bit dissapointing as I had hoped for an explaination for the photo, instead it sort of mysteriously changes into people who look nothing like our reunited couple"
1,reveiw by hands-on trainer,"This book is packed with icebreakers, but I personally wouldn't use most of them. They border on the ""touchy-feely"" side, and will only work if your audience is open to that type of activity."
2,Inventive but is it practical?,"My first observation on this book is that it is focused on the large group not the small group. However, the rationale for some of the large group focus seems to flow entirely from a preoccupation with dividing large groups into smaller groups and then applying tasks or games to these subgroups. If you have never thought about working with groups this book may be of some use, but by and large I judged many of the examples were impractical in terms of the time and resources needed to get deploy them.My key reservation about these icebreaker books is that they are written more to help the presenter break the ice rather than any presumed intra-audience barriers."
4,Fun Training Games,"This is a great book that will give you ideas on how to incorporate fun ice breakers and fun activities into your next training session. After 10 years of training, I am happy to have found this helpful tool to get groups thinking outside of the box, networking together and having a great time. There are so many ways to learn, remember to include them all in your next training which include auditory, visual and kinesthetic approaches.Cheers!"
4,Great resource for group meetings.,"We use this book in our Fortune 500 office all the time. In fact, people are always wanting to borrow it from me when they are planning meetings. It has excellent ideas that are easy to execute. Definitely a keeper!"
1,Rude remarks and low level math,"I'm a former teacher and a current home educating mother of five. I'm always on the lookout for fun, educational software for the kids. I had high hopes for this software as I'm a big fan of Dorling Kindersley books. This game was a huge disappointment. The math problems were much too simple for my 7, 9 and 10 year old children. The characters in the game also make remarks that are impatient and rude which really turned me off. I would not recommend this one. The Learning Company software is a much better match for our family."
4,"Studio, Mainstream Version of Brother McMullen","I saw this before ""the Brothers McMullen"", and thought this movie was great. Eddie Burns is great with visual narrative, and this Main-stream version of ""The Brothers McMullen"" turns out really great. I really like the story, and how the multiple stories were related directly and in message together.I also loved how it ended, and did not have a ""sunset"" Hollywood ending. A great romantic comedy that seemed to be about real people. This is not the more modern romantic comedy with strange characters that are hard to relate too and seem unreal.Eddie is an Indie guy, but this Studio version of his store does not take too many great bounds from the themes of ""The Brothers McMullen"". It simply beefs up the cast and makes the characters and story more ""Hollywood"" (easier to understand off the bat).Overall a great movie, and a worthy of watching, it's pretty clear what you are getting into."
1,1/3 worked the board is super cheap!,Used no more than 30 watts and the copper connectors on certain areas of the board would disconnect from the board. Really can't fix easily. I can;t say I have 20 years of soldering experiences but I would assume if the copper contacts melt away something is not right.
2,Could have been better,"This album has some decent tunes. Musicaly it is a cross of rock, blues with a mild country feel. The first half is the stronger while the rest is forgettable. The main letdown is Rhatigan's abuse of her vocal capacity. Her frequent tendencies to screech and squeel makes me cringe. This is a shame because when restrained she comes across as more confident and sensual.I picked this a for a buck in a used bin - thank god for that."
5,Good insights on living aboad; wonderful humor!,Read Tom Neale. Take notes. Be prepared to laugh out loud. Neale's book is on the short list of important book companions to take along as you cruise.
3,"It's ""OK""","This book, ""Falling Stars"" by Mike D. Reynolds, claims to be ""A Guide to Meteors & Meteorites"" ---- Well, yeah, I guess you could call it that, but he tries to pack a lot of information into 150 pages. The biggest problem that I have with it is that the whole book is in black & white, photos too. Most other books on the subject have color photos so you can see what the samples really look like. Still, it has a lot of useful basics on meteors and meteorites."
1,DO NOT BUY!!!!!,"The seller is AWFUL! They didn't ship my item for a week, when I asked about it they blamed UPS for them never shipping. They would not expedite my order even though they screwed up. Then, when it finally shows up...the product is terrible!!! This item is NOT the product shown. It is nearly black (not brown as shown) and it comes with cheap, bulky, square, silver painted stands."
3,The cats love it...,"This is an excellent cat toy. Our cats go crazy when they see this toy come out and cannot wait to chase it. But, we've gone through at least 2 or 3 of these because they break quickly. The line becomes tangled and then the reel is useless. Usually I can fix the line but it fails again after a few more rounds. It's a shame, because it's an awesome toy when it works. I've stopped buying them at this point because it's too expensive for throwaway item."
2,my cats love it,"I just bought this for my 2 and 3 yr old playful cats. They both love it. I love that I can play with them without putting too much effort into it. To me it seems pretty sturdy, but I have only owned this for a day or so. All in all I have bought a lot of cat toys and I have gotten pretty picky but I love this.let me add to this, about half an hour after I wrote this review my line got tangled and broke. And I am trying to figure out how to fix it. this might have been a waste of money. Awesome concept, poor quality."
2,Too long,As others hav said it's too long when wipers are shut off it rides up on the fender on passenger side put the old one back on so I have 1 winter and 1 regular blade
3,OK,"it works but is about 1/4"" too long. just slightly longer than the orginal.also, the rubber boot over the entire wiper does tear easy."
3,Addictive Ginger,"The Ginger People produce an excellent product; it melts slowly in the mouth with a smooth texture; it delivers a mildly spicy flavor; it's not overly sweet; and it contains some ginger.Yet chewer beware, these tasty treats may be addictive; see the ingredients obtained from the manufacturer's website where sugar is listed first; remember that this is CANDY.Ingredients: cane sugar, ginger, tapioca starch.Two chews contain 40 calories, 0g fat, 0mg sodium, 10g carbohydrate and 10g sugars."
5,"I'm not a ginger lover, but I LOVE these!","I don't love ginger but I don't hate it either. Basically if the recipe I'm using call for ginger, I typically just omit it. I've never cared much for the floral aspects. I purchased these on a whim and am now totally addicted! They start out with a mildly sweet ginger flavor (minus the flower taste) and then change to a wonderful spicy. They are the consistency of a really firm Tootsie Roll and I can't get enough of them!!"
3,Wouldn't buy them again,"These are pretty tasty, but the flavor is VERY strong. The main problem with them is the texture - too much chewing required, and they stick in your teeth. I like ginger, but not these candies. I'll stick with crystallized ginger instead."
2,Spicy Hot Ginger Chews Ick!,"I did not like these at all. I tried these for morning sickness, but I couldn't even swallow them. They were so spicy that they made my mouth burn. They also took a long time to receive after ordering them. Around 2 weeks for them to show up."
2,Great product in terrible packaging.,"If you like ginger, you'll love the taste of these candies. I've had them several times, and the ginger flavor is always pleasantly strong.The wrappers, unfortunately, are consistently a pain to deal with. Most of the time, the paper sticks to the candy in a way that requires five minutes per piece of candy to remove enough paper to eat. Even then, you frequently have to make the decision of whether to just eat some paper or throw out a significant portion of the piece of candy (because paper is irretrievably stuck to it) that you've just labored so intensively to unwrap.I'd rate five stars for the candy by itself. Packaged as I've always received it, however, I can only give this product two stars. It really, really, really should not be so difficult to remove paper from food."
5,Awesome supernatural air story of WWII,This is not just your regular air adventure story - no! This guy ends up meeting a guy in the afterlife who predicts his future for him and sends him back to Earth to have him live it out in all its gruesome reality. But our hero is determined to change his predicted fate - at all costs! A great story with a love story you will not soon forget.
5,An Air Adventure Story--With a Twist,"If this was just an air adventure story all by itself it would be a great read. But then you add in the main character of the story being a hero and in love with a woman who is a Russian--who he is fighting against. Then, he ""dies"" and goes to where all great pilots are supposed to go, only to find out that they will not accept him. So throughout this great air adventure story that L. Ron Hubbard wrote very well, you have these other plots happening and you end up routing for the seemingly not possible acceptance of the main character to pilot's heaven and getting the girl."
3,On Blazing Wings by L Ron Hubbard (Audiobook Review),"L Ron Hubbard is an excellent storyteller. He grabs your attention right away with thrilling scenes of aerial combat, then brings you down into the golden city of Puhjolh, then wraps it up with more dogfighting. In addition to all the fast-paced action, this audiobook may also cause you to stop and think a bit. I won't say that it will change your views on death and the afterlife, but you might find yourself examining your life, at least in some small way. ""On Blazing Wings"" is a story of love, and destiny, and second chances. It teaches us that our lives are not set in stone, and that we can choose a better path for ourselves."
5,Provides a different view of the leader,"Mao: A Reinterpretation is a new political biography of Mao which provides a different view of the leader as a committed revolutionary who contributed to China's history and culture. The real Mao wasn't a genius, nor the evil leader later biographies have portrayed. This reinterpretation examines both his life and the lasting effects of his ideals."
5,Real Life Personfied in Poetry,"These poems are an extention of this authors raw and realistic way of sharing himself and his life with his readers. He writes about things that are a part of everyone's life. It makes you feel his pain, his joy, his sorrow and his life experiences like they were your own and in fact most of them have happened to you as well.Very well written, simple and to the point from the authors heart and touching....and you don't get all bogged down with the King's English and meters ...a must read."
3,It works if you can turn it On,"It works well once is on. It's a pain to turn it on though. Rotating switch is flimsy so don't expect it to last, however for $20 money well spent.Cumbersome ignition process."
1,Worst blowtorch ever,I was able to light it once every 40 tries or so. In the time I spent trying to make it work I could have walked around the corner and bought a new blowtorch.
2,"OK for the money, but not worth it in the long run.","I bought one of these at a local hardware store a couple years ago for just over twenty bucks and it produced a nice, hot, tight flame until recently. I've been using it a lot lately with my oil rig and had noticed that the flame seemed to be getting weak well before the tank was empty, and now I can't even get a good flame out of it when it's full. I just upgraded to a Vector Nitro and it was totally worth it - far hotter (on low, even) than my Weller at its best.Also, the safety mechanism makes the ignition quite clumsy. You have to twist the button and then push it in which is quite impossible with one hand and not always easy with two."
2,Extraordinarily dull reading for such an interesting life,"""A Beautiful Mind"" is promoted as the story of a brilliant mathemetician who overcame mental illness to win a Nobel prize in economics. This is misleading. He won the prize for work he had done 40 years earlier, in spite of his history of mental illness.This biography is no Rocky-of-mathematics comeback story. It's the dry, detailed, well-researched, yet ultimately superficial tale of a man who saw the world a bit differently, and yet the author gives us little sense of what it was like to be John Nash. She tells us what happened in his life, gives us the dates of the important events, and relays anecdotes, but never truly gives us a sense of what life was like for Nash.After reading the biography I feel that I know what he did, but not what he was truly like, and that is a disappointment."
5,engrossing bio,"I must admit, I saw the movie first - and ran out for the book immediately! I loved the book, especially how Nasar wove together the essential elements of context, timing, location. There was enough description of the science involved to give mathematically challenged a sense of what was at stake. Nasar did a good job of describing so much of the U.S. during the 50's and 60's: the various academic environments, the state of psychiatric research and treatment, the paranoia of the cold war, the social mores in play, the economic environment, the political climate.... And all of that was just background to the main attraction: the life of John Nash.Thinking now of the movie, I'm impressed with the really good job they did getting it right. It shouldn't matter to anyone that the details were not the same - it wasn't a documentary, after all. But the movie captured the emotion and energy, like a good impressionist painting.I recommend the book and the movie!"
5,The book is not a hack!,"The book definately trumps the movie on this one (big surprise really...). Although I think that given the descriptions in the book Crowe was a great pick for it (she mentioned his ""powerful"" appearance frequently). It is set up very well, and for someone who doesn't like to sit and read long chapters it is set up into 5 parts with numerous chapters to keep the interest alive.In reference to one of the reviews below, the title of the book came from Lloyd Shapley using the phrase ""a beautiful mind."" Its on page 442 in the acknowledgments. Not being brash about it, just providing a little information to the future readers, since most people don't bother to read those anyway. You'll do about anything on a 23.5 hour bus ride to kill time!"
2,Another unauthorized biography?,"This book chronicles the life of Nobel prize winner John Nash. I found it disturbing in the distinct sense of ""gossip"" I got from the whole book, as John Nash was only referenced as a direct source once or twice, and although Alicia Nash (John's wife) was referenced more often, I still felt that the couple's privacy and wishes weren't respected enough. Note, however, that my opinion isn't based on anything except the feeling I got from reading this book.Another downside is that there was a bit too much detail given to certain things, such as the people Nash met throughout his life... a large percentage of this book doesn't have anything to do with John Nash.Given all of that, it was still incredibly fascinating to learn about this intelligent, torn, complex person."
4,A sad story,"I was torn between two emotions - sadness for Nash and his family and joy in the human friendships and love that supported him through all his difficult years. It's a tribute to the mathematical community that there were so many individuals who cared and assisted him however they found possible. As for the details of the book, it's well written, articulate and full of historical anecdotes. Makes for a very pleasant read."
3,"A good book, could have been a lot better","The book painted a vivid picture of what pschizophrenia is for a person who never really understood what it means to be schizophrenic, and that for me was the most interesting part of the novel. Also some insight is given into the nature of genius, and how precious it is. But overall it did not flow very nicely and had many redundancies that became annoying after a while making the book more difficult to read than it might have been. probably a few pages could have been cut here and there."
3,A tabloid analysis of a human being.,"Nash was not a very well like person, certainly not by Sylvia Nasar. Which makes me wonder how she could even spend the time to write this biography. Her analysis of Nash seem to be base on heresay and embarrasing gossip.Her only point of passion in this book, was the character description of the two women in Nash's life."
3,Explanations are weak,"I wanted to understand some of the basic math, economics, and game theory. I think with just a few more words, the author could have made the concepts comprehensible. Instead, she opted for over-simplifed explanations that just didn't sound right and couldn't help the reader learn. A few times I wanted to throw the book against the wall due to its lack of comprehensible explanations. After doing some research, I think some of the technical material was over-simplifed to the point of being wrong. Nonetheless, I enjoyed the book because of the characters."
4,Nobel Prize Winner and Schizophrenic,"This is a very interesting biography about the Nobel Prize winner, John Nash. The math and economics in this book were beyond my ability to understand. What I focused on was the presentation of Nash's mind, social interactions, mental illness, and bi-sexuality. Interesting aspects of Nash's history are his deadbeat dad, his relationship with Eleanor Stier, and his continuing to hang out at Princeton University when he was ill. I was pleased to learn that his colleagues and students treated Nash with respect even when he was at his worst. I was fascinated by the seeming remission of his schizophrenia as Nash aged.Nash has a beautiful mind and I applaud Ms.Nasar for writing this book!"
5,A Beautiful Mind,"Was impressed by the speedy service, the book was in perfect condition. I am truly satisfied."
4,A fair biography made memorable by an extrodinary subject,"An interesting study of a number of subjects: mathematics and economics, life in academia, schizophrenia, Nobel politics, and last but not least the complex personality of John Nash.Nasar's journalistic style does not make for spellbinding reading, but the subject is himself interesting enough that the book keeps the reader's interest through it's 450 page. To Nasar's credit, she strikes the perfect balance between in presenting the mathematical themes. She neither presents too little nor too much, and she does this in a way that allows lay readers to appreciate the elegance of Nash's discoveries.Nash is not always a likeable character, but he always fascinates. Nasar paints the supporting characters with enough realism and depth that the reader cares what happens next; the pages keep turning. A good science biography."
1,"A beautiful mind, a annoying man","While reading the book I kept wanting to like Mr. Nash. I couldn't, he seemed to be an annoying prig for most of the book. Always trying to show off. I slogged through the book hoping but even the ending was tepid, 'glad he got the Nobel so he could get a credit card.' There was not enough in the book to show why he deserved the Nobel, more of an 'it was important'. Some things were explored with great detail and other parts were glossed over, a very uneven read. This is one book I will not recommend to other people. I can only wonder how the movie was able to dredge enough interesting things together."
5,Journey to and from madness,"The author gives a straightforward exposition of Nash's mathematical ideas and schizophrenia. Her story of the undercurrent behind Nash's Nobel is fascinating and one of very few such descriptions available in a book. If I had to sum up the book, it is about genius, journey, and the thin line between madness and genius."
3,A Frustrating Read,"I picked this book up to read on my flight home. Skimming through tht first few pages of the Prologue, I was not surprised to find out that the movie screen writers had chosen to dramatize, fabricate or omit certain elements. But the content of the book or the movie is not what I am reviewing.Sylvia Nasar chose to include too much detail in her sentences, to the extent that they did not flow. More often than not, she would tack on useless trivia or personal opinions - that don't add to the reading experience, and frankly I don't care about! - interrupting the reader's train of thought. Unlike a previous review, I would've appreciated the author including the details as footnotes instead of forcing them into the sentences. Otherwise, it was a very informative book, with interesting background on the recruitment of foreign scientists and mathematicians to the United States."
2,more information than you need or want,"If you want a detailed account of the life of John Nash - along with a detailed account of everyone and everything that touched his life, then this is your book. Well written but much too much information for the non-scientist. And I never did find an explanation of his game theory.... was it ever really explained or only its impact?"
3,Not 'new',I ordered a new copy. I received an extremely 'yellowed' paperback that seemed no at all new. I can still read it and there are no marks...but yellow limp pages not nice.
1,John Nash is messed up,John Nash made the life of those around him miserable. The person who suffered the most is his wife. An intelligent woman who is attracted to a selfish man invites misery.
1,Dad's father's day gift,"Amazon's website wouldn't let me type a zip code; the website defaulted the zip based on city name and zip was incorrect. As a result, package couldn't be delivered and I was issued a full refund."
5,A very enjoyable read,"Nasar does an excellent job of introducing us to John Nash and to essential economic concepts such as game theory. The book does several things well. Best of all, it tells the story of John Nash who is one of the one most original thinkers of the twentieth century. We see all sides of Nash: his brilliance, arrogance, childishness, madness, and reawakening. Alicia, his wife, seems nothing less than extraordinary in this story. Nasar also gives us a basic introduction to economic and mathematical theory that is easy to understand and move through. The end result is a well-written and well-told story that is engaging, intelligent, and difficult to put down. I read the book in only two days, and enjoyed every minute."
3,"IN THE INDEX, WHERE'S FEYNMAN?","Please do NOT print my review of yesterday. It contains an inexcusable overstatement regarding the number of American mathematicians discussed in the book. If it is too late to withdraw the review, please do not fail to also print this addendum to it. Thank you. -- lloyd rowsey"
3,Not close enough,"After reading his nobel laureate autobiography, brief as it was, I was left unsatisfied by this biography that was too distant in it's approach. It was as though the author was walking twenty feet behind Nash and gave little if any real insight into what he was makng of his environment. It was an interesting time full of interesting characters, many of which the author gives more insight into than Nash himself."
2,Not What You Will Expect,"I had already seen the movie when I plowed through this biography of the great mathematician John Nash. In my reading, I could not decide if I was reading a book about math or a book about psychology. There is a lot of extra information about other mathematicians and their works that I found irrelevant to the point of the book. A simple focus on Nash, with the story of his life is what I had expected. However, what I got was more information than I was interested. Stick to the movie. It overdramatizes the life of Nash, but it's a lot easier to follow."
1,I wanted to like this book,"but I found the book depressing both because of the writing and subject. In fact I had such negative feelings about the book that I refused to watch the movie until a friend insisted.The movie is excellent, wonderful, and the John Nash of the movie is interesting and human. I decided to read the book again. Certainly there is little similarity between the two stories.I don't know which one is true either. The book does not make John Nash seem human to me. I guess if I have to choose I'd pick the movie."
1,Worst book ever,"This book does not do justice to John Nash. He's a brilliant man and deserves someone to write a real book about him, not just copy down facts and call it a book. Anyone with time on their hands could have written this book. It's just a collcection of facts, many of them completely useless and irrelevant, that are put together in a ""book"". It's much more interesting to read Webster's dictionary than this book. John Nash is a great man, I'm so sorry on his behalf for this ""book""."
2,not like the movie at all,"Nasar is a good writer and she's obviously done her research. My problem was with the subject matter. In this book John Nash comes across as boring, creepy, and a bit of a jerk. Not the kind of person I care to read about."
5,A BEAUTIFUL MIND IS A BEAUTIFUL STORY1,"I read the book before seeing the movie and could not believe how different one was from the other. While I preferred the book to the movie, both spun a very real tale of what it is like living on the edge with schizophrenia. The book was more in-depth and the details and characters were rich and vibrant. The movie, on the other hand, contained segments which painted a rather over-dramatized, Hollywood view and many of the intimate details were lost. The book tells of Nash's younger years, his college years, his illness and recovery. One will be touched deeply by the story and it will, no doubt, be one you will remember for years to come. It is sensitive, inspirational and highly emotional reading. The book contains well-developed characters and weaves a beautiful story from start to finish. ""A Beautiful Mind"" is highly recommended and deserving of far more than five stars in the rating."
3,Not so beautiful,"This is a poor biography of a brilliant man. Nasar's style is too journalistic, which isn't unexpected since she is a journalist, but as a consequence she lacks psychological insight and can't get herself nor us into Nash's skin.What truly cheapens Nasar's biography is that she directly pleads Nash's case for him at the end, claiming he is of a stronger character now than he was in his arrogant youth, although she recounts an appalling episode after Nash's recovery in which Nash expresses vicious opinions on his elder son. Nasar should have given us the facts and allowed us to make up our minds ourselves.I wish Nash and his family a peaceful life, if they will accept a stranger's blessing."
1,So...what is this book about???,"I had just finished watching the movie Beautiful Mind and rushed out the purchase this book...I was very dissapointed with it.I was dissapointed in the way the book was written. The first 1/3 of the book reads like a brochure for Princeton, Nash is hardly mentioned. The rest of the book mentions him more, but the author CLEARLY was trying to write the longest book she could by filling it with the most bulls**t she could copy and paste. I found myself skipping over nearly entire chapters due to this.I would recommend the movie instead of this book anyday. The movie makes Dr. Nash look like a genious with some social problems, living an adventerous and romantic life while dealing with a mental illness. The book makes him out to be a COMPLETE jerk, though still a genious, living a life not to terribly extraordinary. I dont know which description is more acurate, but at least the movie is MUCH more entertaining and less frustrating then this book!!"
3,"The history of Princeton University, not John Nash","This book should have been called ""The History of Princeton University"" instead of ""A Beautiful Mind"".I haven't had a chance to see the movie yet so I decided to read the book. I really didn't learn all that much about John Nash. However I did learn about M.I.T, Einstein, Princeton University and other famous places and people. It's not that I was really disappointed but I think the book could have been a lot shorter if it just stuck with the story of John Nash. A lot of chapters in the book didn't even discuss John. It was a good book and I learned a lot of things I didn't know before."
5,A beautiful read,This man's story is facinating. I read this after seeing the movie and it was wonderful. The book gives some deeper insight into his marriage and life as well that you'll enjoy.
4,"watch the movie, but be sure to read the book","Watch the movie for the Hollywood treatment of Nash's life, but read the book for the real story. (Love does not cure schizophrenia, but time does.) Sylvia Nasser is to be commended for her evenhanded, compassionate treatment of a complex man and his complex body of work. Although her detailed descriptions of his mathematical endeavors may prove to be heavy going, she also brings Nash to life in his glory as an innovative thinker, and in his ordeal as a victim of mental illness. A caveat to keep in mind: Not every genius is schizophrenic, and not every schizophrenic person is brilliant. Also remember that Nash's anti-Semitic ravings stemmed from his mental disorder, not from the man himself."
4,It's definately worth reading,"Did you ever wonder what it might be like to hang it with geniuses working together on a common goal? That what it must have been like at Princeton in the late 40s and early 50s. I loved this book because it gives us a glimpse into that kind of world. As a highly isolated economics student trying to finish his dissertation, Nasar's book made me feel like I wasn't alone. I still can't get over the fact that Nash's dissertation was just 27 pages long!!"
4,excellent book - more honest than the movie,"The book tells much more of the entire story of his life, good and bad. The movie makes him more likable, which is understandable."
4,"Beautiful Mind, Beautiful Math, and Very Fine Biography","I remember reading in night school John Rawls's A THEORY OF JUSTICE, which referenced one J.F. Nash's 1950's paper, and thought how I never heard about any subsequent work or about him again. Ms. Nasr's biography gives a fairly comprehensive explanation why. My one minor complaint is I wish Knopf had taken the trouble to place it in a more readible format/typography. (I know there is an audiobook, but still prefer the pleasure of reading, however fitfully). Contentwise,Ms. Nasr gives an adequate rendering of his personal life: mathematical work and contemporaries,years with mental illness, and barring remission, his triumph over them. In this regard, this biography has the graceful arc of a finely wrought novel."
3,A beautiful story; an okay audio,"Having read about half the book before taking a long road trip, my wife and I picked up the audio CD for the ride. As far as truth of the abridgement, I can attest that the first half of the audio CD stays true to the book (and I would assume that follows through to the rest of the book). As such, the story is everything the reviews say it is, and would have won it 4 stars.My only complaint with the audio CD is that the reader was at times difficult to hear over the car speakers and it was difficult to follow which character was speaking when not specifically cited (granted, I'm comparing this to a few Clancy audio CDs I have). Because of these two factors, it was difficult to really follow the reader without occassionally having attention drift off. For this, the review is knocked down to 3 stars...I don't regret the purchase and would recommend it, but it's not what I was hoping for."
4,Cool and Fun little house,"I bought this house and the bumper cars for my 7 year old daughter for Christmas. I got it at Toys R Us store for a great savings and my daughter loves it. She enjoys the updated features such as the little lava lamp, the juice bar, and the video game. She loves to dress her dolls and there is even a space provided to store some clothes and the small accessories that come with the house. It folds up fairly small for storage. She has some of the 4-ever dolls, Kellys, and the Wee 3 dolls and they all live in this cute house in harmony. I think it's a great success."
2,Daughter ignored it. And now: teeny parts everywhere.,"It's been eight months. The doll house remains untouched. The fold-up / stand-up architecture is more klunky than clever. The teeny tiny little bits are a perpetual annoyance. The bright side is that she's not interested in them, either, so it doesn't matter if they accidentally get vacuumed up."
2,Unless they are LED they Aren't Good,"These kind of lights break to easily. say you go over a rough railroad track, your out of 70$."
3,exactly what i needed for cutting fire blanket,i give this knife about a 3.4 rating mainly because at times its difficult to open and the clasp or lanyard hoop (not sure what its called) has some sharp edges where it is riveted in place. the blade is carbon steel which is exactly what i was looking for. klein does sell a stainless model but i prefer carbon for this type of blade because its easer to maintain the blade. i use a round diamond sharpener on it. i use this on fire blanket to build hooches and it works much better then box cutters. as for durability i don't see any problems with it except for the plastic handles but they look and feel like good plastic.
4,Good Sequel to Nagina,"SHEMAROO subtitles all the songs of ""Nigahen."" SPARK does not subtitle the songs of ""Nigahen."" This is the biggest difference between the two editions of this movie.The SHEMAROO edition of ""Nigahen"" displays a logo throughout the movie after the opening credits. The SPARK edition displays no logos or watermarks.The subtitles for the dialogue in the SHEMAROO edition ""stick"" for about 2 minutes about halfway through the movie (at least they do in my copy).The movie itself is a good sequel to ""Nagina"" with many good songs. I prefer the SHEMAROO edition because SHEMAROO subtitles its songs. (SHEMAROO subtitles all the songs in ""Nagina"" as well. SPARK and EAGLE do not subtitle the songs of ""Nagina."")"
4,Not for Profit accounting is not easy,I have looked at a number of books on the subject and this one comes the closest yet to having the kind of information I am looking for. The basic problem is that all these books think that you have a full time accounting staff. I have a degree in accounting and a MBA so I know something. For the small non profit what these books all say to do is unreasonable. The average board member has difficulty understanding a simple P & L.
2,Soporific and Overly Wordy.,"Reads like a law textbook. Author often uses three sentences where one would do. Much ink is wasted telling the reader ""we won't go into that here, but Chapter ""X"" deals exclusively with that."" Concepts are understandable for those with an accounting background, but definitely would not recommend to someone without a solid grasp of accounting fundamentals. Author should have hired a writer to help him smooth out his writing style. Not recommended."
3,Not for Profit,"This book has some good information for novices. If you become involved with the finances of such an organization, the book is informative. If you have an accounting background and are looking for info on how not for profit accounting differs from GAAP, this book won't help you."
3,Raising Great Kids in Tough World,"Probably good for some people but for me, it was far too general. I prefer the book Raising Good Kids (from birth to the Teenage years) by Dr Thomas Lickona."
2,For Beginners Only,"I have been doing martial arts for almost six years and bought this book looking for new ways to develop speed and strength that directly relate to martial arts. I found the book to be very elementary, it lists different suggested workouts for different arts, but they are just a different combination of simple exercises such as pushups and body weight squats. If you have never done martial arts or followed a workout plan before, this is a good beginner book. If you're already working out or have been doing martial arts for more than a year, I'd look elsewhere."
2,Not all that useful,"If you already have even a minimal background in sports and fitness, I would not recommend spending the money to buy this book. While it is informative and well written, I found that I already knew most of the material even though I have no formal education in sports and fitness - I just got into weightlifting on my own and figured things out, sometimes by watching what other people in the gym were doing. However, if you are totally clueless when it comes to strength training, then this book would probably be useful for you."
2,Not good enough quality,"I bought these because they were on sale, but I can see why. I do not like them because they always ride up too high on my leg and just don't seem to fit as well as all the other boxers I buy from Old Navy. If you are into the silk feel and don't mind the boxers getting crunched up all the time, go for it. I'm a bit disappointed, however."
5,Worth the buy...,"I got 3 sets of these boxers not knowing much about the quality, fitting, material, etc... All I have to say is these are well worth for the price!"
2,Beyond a sophamore slump,"I loved Baby Animals first CD, so I was very excited when this CD came out. Sadly, ""Shaved and Dangerous"" is unremarkable. I don't know enough about the Australian music scene to know why this album was there last, but listening to it is a pretty good clue. While most of the songs are okay, there is not a single one as good as the worst song on their first CD. I haven't been this disappointed in a follow-up CD besides ""Wig"" or maybe ""Gravity Kills"". If you Don't already own it (and you probably don't), buy their self-titled debut instead. It ROCKS."
3,Not as good as first effort,"I gotta say i didn't become Baby Animals fan right away the hit the scene, but after listening to thier first record, i liked them a lot. A Rock band with a strong frontwoman, some rocking anthems, some slower tunes, even a bit of hard rock riffs and attitude. However, this second album lacks of a lot of the aforementioned. Half the songs are kinda boring, seems the imagination and attitude is gone and gives you the impression they ""had"" to record a follow up instead of they ""wanted"" to."
4,One of the best Aussie rock bands of the 90's!,"Baby Animals created a bit of a stir in the early 90's with their self-titled debut CD which sold very well and helped get them support gigs with both Bryan Adams and Van Halen. That album was very good and filled with a lot of catchy heavy rock tunes. They followed that up with this more diverse collection of songs and a more polished overall production. Led by the sexy female lead singer Suzi Demarchi, Baby Animals established themselves as the leading live band in Australia and tore up every stage they played on no matter how large or small. They were at the peak of their career following their first album but this is still a worthy recording for all fans of good Aussie rock!"
1,"No hooks, no beat, no Lyrics",What a disappointment I loved there first album. They defiantly fall into the second album let down category. Gone was the hard edge they had to their songs in the first album. Skip this one.
5,"Excellent for the price, but its particle board","We were positively surprised by the looks. Minimal smell, confirming the lack of VOCs. It does not scratch THAT easily, I dropped a few pcs around while assembling but didnt cause any damage. We were also positively surprised by the dresser we bought from the same line, though we havent extensively used it since the baby is still on the way. The material seems particle board, not solid wood."
2,"Nice crib, but not worth the money.","The crib is fairly nice and fits together very well, but I had a few issues with this bed. First the finish is not a true espresso finish. Not compared to our other furniture that is espresso finish. Second the hardware that holds the mattress is very noticeable after the crib was assembled. Big metal brackets are attached to the sides of the front legs and sticks out like a sore thumb."
4,Great crib. Affordable price,Just put the crib together. Very easy assembly. Directions were spot on. The only draw back is that the screws and screw holes are visible. If that doesn't bother you (I'm okay with it) then this crib is perfect. Great size and you can't beat the convertibility.
4,"Love it, wish it was heavier","I think this will be a great crib, although I am not convienced it's going to hold up to really be able to use as full bed but only time will tell. I love the color and the look but I wish it was a little heavier, seems a little too light making me wonder if it's cheap. The screw holes do show on the outside but aren't too noticable, I didn't know that when buying and may have thought twice. I like the look of it being 1 big piece not a bunch of assemebled pieces. Im also concerned since out first one came damaged because it seemed as if another heavy box was dropped on top of this box causing a deep gash on 2 parts of the wood and one of the slats was together but completely cracked all the way through, which means if you pushed on it, it would break off into 2 pieces and not be fixable. But Amazon was great about sending out a new one and we just replaced the front since it was already put together."
5,Just like the pictures,"Make sure to read the instructions. I had to take apart and re-assemble several times because I just started putting it together. Oh the instructions are in French, look for the small print in English.There is a plastic envelope on the bottom of the metal frame for the mattress that holds the instructions. Great for later when you want to use the toddler rail (which comes with the crib!) or turn it into a twin bed. Now I wont have to dig around and find a place to keep them safe.The crib does look like it has a bit of cherry in it, but matches great with all of my other espresso furniture.Very sturdy, no dents or scratches. It looks like it may actually last all the way to a regular sized bed! Really excited to put it to use."
4,Beautiful Crib,This is a very beautiful crib and arrived quickly. We looked at many many cribs online and in stores and decided to go with this one after the wonderful reviews on Amazon. It is very sturdy and has a wonderful cherry finish although does take some time to put together. We used wood glue as added support which worked out well and we highly recommend. Also we used an electric drill which saved us a lot of time (which we finally used after assembling two out of the three pieces) instead of manually screwing in the nuts and bolts. As other commments have mentioned the finish does scratch easily so be careful when you put it together.We also bought the 4 Drawer dresser and the Combo Changing Dresser. We were nervous the woods may be different shades but surprisingly all the pieces matched perfectly and complete the nursery. We are very pleased with our DaVinci purchase and of course Amazon. Would recommend this crib/set!
4,great - except for teethers,"This is a great crib. We ordered 2, one for my 9 month old and one for the one on the way in a couple of months. It's is incredible sturdy and well made. Easy to put together and exactally the color we were looking for. I was pleasently surprised by the quality given the cost.Only issue we discovered a few days ago is since my daughter is teething, her sharp little teeth scratch the surface of the wood and leaves marks if she chews on the edge. Not sure if this is an issue for all wooden cribs."
3,HARD TO ASSEMBLE,"looks nice but it is hard to assemble..CS was not very friendlymake sure though you have time when you start this and make sure you do it right so you dont need to call CS and ask for parts.also get the teething guard for the sides with this and put them on... the babies love to bite on the sides of this and if there is no guard on it will destroy the crib and you will find bunch of brown residue in your baby's mouth..babies have sharp teeth and this crib is soft and paint comes off easy..use it right and be careful and it will last you a good while.. we had ours for 3 years by now and 2 kids.final point : INSTALL IT WELL, GET THE TEETH GUARD lol--------------------If you fine my reviews helpful please mark it as so.. Thank you."
2,Very disappointed!,"I bought this bed for my granddaughter thinking it would grow with her and be worth the investment. First, I was surprised how soft the wood was... my granddaughter was found biting off pieces. I had to tie a blanket over the top edges to keep her from eating wood. Second, the screws stripped out of tne sides when she jumped on the bed in a fit (didn't think it was time for bed). Of course this broken side piece is a required part in the growth of the bed. My granddaughter is now three and in a new bed."
4,Looks good and works but gets scratched very easily,"It looks nice and it's been working ok so far for about 3 months. The wood seems to be light and cheap material, and it gets very easily scratched. I know it can be converted to a full size bed but I don't think I want to use it as a full size bed at the rate it's getting scratched."
5,Perfect!,I absolutely love this crib! I bought it for my daughter in the spring of 2010. It is very sturdy and great quality. I love the color and I really can't think of anything bad to say about it. You can't beat the price that comes with this quality. I purchased the changer and the dresser as well and love them both. I will probably buy the same set for my next child or at least buy a product from this brand. Love it! :-)
4,Looks great!,We order the crib for baby #2 early so we haven't actually used it with baby yet but it's very attractive and assembly wasn't overly complicated. Very comparable to the $500 one we bought for baby #1 and it's great that it comes with the toddler rail so you don't have to buy a separate rail set if you don't want to turn it into a full bed.
3,"expensive, bulky","it's a nice crib, but it scratches easily. pine wood. would go with something harder like maple next time. shipping was ok. i don't like the current trend of this cheap do it yourself furniture, but to keep prices down, you have to do what you have to do."
1,LIMBS GET STUCK!!,"This crib was great at first. Then at three month my baby started to roll. I tried putting the bumpers in, but they would not fit, so we were going to try to fix it. I put my son in the crib while I went to the bathroom and when I came back out his leg was stuck in between the wooden slates up to his thigh. I could not pull his leg out, so we tried pulling the slates apart trying to bend the wood to shimmy his leg out, but it did not work and he was screaming in pain and panic. To finally get him out we had to pull one of the wooden slates until it actually broke off in order for us to get his leg out. Fortunatly for us he was not actually harmed any any way. We have not put him back in this crib. The slates should not be wide enough for a little baby's limbs to get stuck and then the end slates be so wide that the bumbers do not fit. This is an unsafe crib."
4,"BUEN PRODUCTO, BUEN DISEÑO","Un producto de alto valor, la calidad de los materiales es super aceptable, muy resistente y con un diseño elegante de mucha altura."
2,made in china or taiwan,"I have been researching cribs extensively. There is alot of misinformation on the internet including information stating that Davinci cribs are made in the USA. Davinci cribs are made by the company Million Dollar Baby. I contacted MDB for information on where the cribs are built. Their response was as follows:"" Thank you for your interest in MDB. Our furniture in manufactured, under the highest standards in Taiwan and China. Please keep in mind, all juvenile products are required by federal law to abide by the rules of the CPSC in order for them to be sold to customer. All of our cribs are manufactures to comply with the federal guidelines and standards set forth by the CPSC, as well as the ASTM."" Unfortunately I purchased a Davinci mini crib prior to acquiring this information. I don't know that this company is any better that others who manufacture product in china.Hope this information is helpful to others looking for a safer crib"
4,Great crib for the price,"I searched high and low for an affordable black crib. This one kept popping up everywhere I looked. I finally ordered it and am very happy with it! It's relatively easy to put together with 2 people. It probably took my husband and I 40 mins (while wrangling our baby). It does show the screw holes, but on the black wood it's not that noticeable and doesn't bother me at all. My baby isn't standing yet, but I plan on buying the teething rail covers to protect the wood (and my baby!).Overall, highly recommended!"
4,So far so good,"Directions a little annoying but went together pretty easy. Because of the shape, a bumper pad did not fit right. Still happy with product"
4,Really Nice,"My mom bought me this crib (from Amazon) as a gift for her new grandson. It is very nice, really good quality. I gave it 4 stars instead of 5 because the instructions were not the easiest to understand, but other than that, I have no complaints."
5,Kalani Crib,So far so good. the baby has been using it for a few months and is fine. I like it because it allows to get the baby in it until is ready for good furniture for his bedroom
5,Love this furniture!,Mu husband and I bought almost the entire DaVinci Kalani bedroom set for our son almost 2 years ago. It took my husband a couple of hours to put all 4 pieces of furniture together including the crib. He said it was not that bad. The furniture has held up great and I know we will be able to use it for many years! There are a few scratches but I think any crib would eventually get scratches from teething or toys. They aren't that bad and can definitley live with them!
2,DaVinci Kalani Crib in Honey Oak,"Just received this crib yesterday. First of all, the box had split open and the pieces were all falling out on my porch. Secondly, the color, honey oak, looks more red than anything...the color is nothing like the picture depicted. It's still a nice crib, but if I had to do it over again, I would just go to the store and find one. If it wasn't so big and heavy, I would pack this up and ship it back."
3,Solid crib with horrible finish.,"First the good. The crib is beautiful and it's very sturdy. The wood is great and I do love it. It is a little difficult for me because I'm short and the front doesn't go down, but I also like it for the same reason. There are no moveable parts to pinch little fingers. I like how the whole crib doesn't move when my daughter jumps up and down.But, the finish is terrible. It scratches extreamly easily and there are teeth marks all up and down the rails. I scratched it on accident with just my fingernail. We are going to have to refinish it when my daughter is older."
4,Great looking crib...though alittle darker,"We decided to order the DaVinci Kalani based on others reviews since it's not sold in a lot of stores.It arrived packaged very well and took my wife and I about an hour to put together. That was with taking our time and making sure everything was fitting correctly and not scuffing the finish. We did ding it once, but with the lighter color finish, it's not very noticeable.On the subject of color, it does appear darker than the image shown. It's not a big issue, but some might be disappointed.I measured the mattress location after assembling the crib to verify that the mattress we have on our registry will fit. Guess what, it won't. The dimensions are 52""L x 28"" W. Make sure you double check.All in all, it's a VERY sturdy crib and I have no doubts that our little girl will love it. The rails are slim enough that they should fit any mobile/crib toy."
5,Great crib for the money,"Really like this crib. Went together easily and looks great. The toddler rails that come with it are a bonus. While you can purchase the rails to convert to a full bed, I highly doubt the crib is going to withstand the early years of childhood well enough to ever function as a bed. That should be expected though at this price."
4,"A solid, sturdy, well made crib.","My wife and I just purchased this crib for our first baby. When it arrived, it was well packed and all the wood pieces were covered in protective foam wrap. The crib was easy to assemble and is very sturdy. The hardware is of good quality. We love the color and the finish has a beautiful luster. The only negative is that the finish scratches quite easily. In assembling the crib, it is nearly impossible to not hit the pieces together and each time I did, it left a little scratch. Still, we are happy with the crib and look forward to using it!"
4,Good Crib,"I purchased this crib after months of reading reviews and consumer reports and it is everything I hoped it would be. The crib I purchased is a Kalani Espresso; the color is a little darker than I anticipated, but it is still very nice. The other reviewers of this crib are right...it does scratch and chip easily. However, if you are careful with putting the crib together you can manage little or no damage to the finish with assembly. If you put the parts together wrong the surface will be scratched just from the parts rubbing together...unfortunately, the directions are not very helpful. My husband and I had better luck just looking at the picture on the front of the directions!"
4,Great so far,"Contrary to what others have said, putting together the crib is NOT difficult. It looks fantastic. We decided to go with the Kalani crib with the espresso Roxanne furniture (changing table and dresser). All were relatively simple to put together, although I would recommend having two sets of eyes to view the instruction. We avoided the Roxanne due to the drop down side.Still waiting on the baby, but if she doesn't like it, I'm sure she will let us know. Best wishes."
1,Destroyed this crib during assembly,"This was the worst piece of furniture I have ever assembled in my life. I actually destroyed part of it in a fit of rage trying to get the machine bolt to fit into the barrel nut to assemble the frame of the crib together. Now I am out the cost of the crib and need to go buy another one. Even for those who are used to putting furniture together, prepare to lose your mind with this one. Got to love the geniuses who design these things and have obviously given no consideration the the mental health of the poor parents trying to put the stupid thing together. Buy this product unassembled = anneurism during assembly."
1,Promotional Discount Didn't go through!,"This review won't be useful to those wishing (of course) to know about the product, but I had to write. I bought this item right off the Amazon Mom's Promotional page promising a 20% discount. Every item in my order but this one was discounted! Now, I can't find a way to contact Amazon about this and am out more than $40."
1,Parts not included,"Crib comes with NO mattress or parts necessary to make it a 4 in 1 crib. All are extra. Shipping costs are almost 50% of the price. Buy at Kids Are us and save the money and trouble.Don't buy here, get help with what all is needed to use as advertised."
4,Da Vinci,"Just got this gifted. Arrived safely and on time. Relatively easy to assemble, took hubby &dad 1.5 hrs. Bought the espresso and like the color....follow up review in few months."
4,Good Crib,Very sturdy - not too complicated to put together. All the parts were included. Each part was labeled. Make sure you sort the hardware before you begin and it is no trouble to follow the instructions.
4,Davinci Kalani Convertible Crib,"After researching and pricing cribs, we settled on the Million Dollar Baby Brand (DaVinci) and from there chose the Kalani Convertible Crib. Although we had some issues with the quality of some parts, Amazon was prompt in sending out replacements. Only wish that this came with a ""repair"" kit as it easily scratches. However, the crib itself is beautiful, my only draw back (aside from how ""soft"" the wood must be) is that the hardware is quite visible once put together. Great crib for the money."
5,Excellent Crib,"We got this for our twin boys and they have enjoyed it much. They play in it, chew it and love it. We love it too....the set up is easy and it is very sturdy. I am going to buy another one now that they need their separate cribs."
4,Beautiful crib for your nursery,I ordered this crib and was pleasantly surprised by the quality and packaging when it arrived. They put lots of care into padding it and assembly was not overly difficult. It's a beautiful piece that looks more expensive than I expected.
5,"Beautiful Crib, Great Price.","The crib arrived only 3 days after I purchased, kudos to Amazon for that. I had no trouble assembling the crib by myself in about 1 hour. I found the instructions easy to follow and the hardware easy to work with. The final product was a beautiful, sturdy crib that I trust my daughter will enjoy."
5,Very nice crib,"We purchased this item on amazon, as they had the best price. We are very pleased with this crib, the color is very nice, and it is sturdy. It did not take my husband long to set up. Cant wait for baby to use it."
1,Don't Buy - Not Practical for Babies,"While this crib looks beautiful and is very sturdy, the wood is so incredible soft that it scratches very easy. Not only is it hard to assemble without causing nicks and scratches in the wood but once you put your child in it you can kiss the nice look goodbye. Our 1-year old no longer chews on things and puts things in her mouth but one day rested her mouth on the edge of the crib, not even gnawing on it, and now the finish is stripped and there are dents in the wood. It is a shame because this is a great looking crib and seems to be fairly good quality but the wood is way too soft for this to be a practical material for a child!! The idea that you can keep this bed for years to come is a farse because by the time your child is old enough for the full-size bed the wood will be so scratched and dented that you will want to replace it!"
4,"Looks great, assembly was relatively easy.","This crib has only been in my house for a couple of weeks, and baby isn't here yet. However, I do really like this crib. I originally purchased a ""sturdy heirloom quality"" crib at over $700. After I saw this one on display, I returned the other one. This one is just as sturdy. We took about an hour to put it together, but both daddy and mommy are good with tools. The instructions were not very clear-- whole steps were omitted and there were typos all over the place making you think you had skipped a step, when it was just a (s) in the wrong place. I had read other reviews, so we put a big comforter down to lay out all of the pieces to avoid scratches. It came with gliders - and I have hardwood floors. It hasn't scratched my floors, and it's easy for me to move it (8 months pregnant) to sweep/vacuum the room. I feel like $250 for a crib makes it worth it if it doesn't last.... and the fact that the toddler rail is included made it even more of a bargain."
4,"Great looking, sucky instructions","Hubby put crib together on his own in less than an hour. The instructions were poorly organized and was his only complaint. Other than that, his ole ingenuity guided him and the crib looks great. The crib is a lot bigger than anticipated but welcomed. We had 4 screws left over and can only imagine it belongs to the toddler rail, although it would have made just as sense to reuse screws. We tested the stability by placing our 20 lb dog in the crib, and it remained stable."
4,"solid crib, decent value","We are still awaiting the arrival of our little one, but we have assembled the crib. We followed the directions exactly and it went together pretty easy. Just read over the first few steps before you start and lay out the hardware so it is easy for you because some of the parts look similar. It took us about 2 hours.The crib is solid and looks very nice. I like how the mattress frame will adjust as our little guy grows and how it came with the toddler rail. As some have mentioned, the holes where you screw in the hardware aren't the most inconspicuous, but you don't want covers because of choking hazards to your baby. We took white paint and painted the heads of the screws and that helped. I do not find that it is a deal-breaker for us. The white finish is not tough though. We did have one area scratch during assembly. They could've done a better job on that. But, again it wasn't something we felt is a deal breaker.Overall, we are really happy with our purchase, so far!"
4,"Great looking, sturdy crib","Ordered from Amazon and not only a slightly better price, but free supersaver shipping better than truck delivery and ended up being faster too (shipped day after order FedEx overnight). Crib is true to color (bought espresso) and very sturdy. Took about a half hour with two people...would have been over an hour by myself due to the fact that you need to suspend some pieces in the air to attach them. Not looking forward to lowering the crib height-that was the most annoying part of assembly. Didn't scratch during assembly, but wife did with her engagement ring while taking baby out. Overall, great crib, hope it wears well. By the way, full size bed rails were hard to find order them now so they aren't discontinued by the time you'll need them."
4,Good buy!,We recieved this crib shortly after placing the order. Came in one compact box. Was fairly easy to assemble and seems to be of good quality for the price. I would reccomend this crib!
4,Fit Form and Function,"Only using it for a newborn at this point so time will tell on additional options. I own other convertible cribs for my other children(older now) however and they have lasted much abuse.-I'd say the color is pretty true to the photo, it's not really an espresso.-Assembly was great, easy, instructions are incredibly user friendly.-Packaged better than any furniture/product I've ever bought.It(the box) arrived destroyed, but the item was still flawless because of their packaging."
3,purchased a few days ago,"well,very quick shipping so that was nice!love the color,no where for my son to get fingers and toes stuck in,solid,doesnt move when hes jumping around.my only complaint is that its was getting scratches and dents all over when i was trying to put it together...frustrating.:/"
3,"Overall good product; scratches easily, though.","I managed to avoid scratches during the entire assembly process, up to the point of attaching the front. This involved lots of sliding tight wood pieces into place, and even with trivial contact, the roughness of the unfinished ends was enough to ruin the (apparently shallow) finish. DaVinci should address the problem of scratches in the form of a better finish or denser wood. I've built my own furniture before, and I haven't used particularly expensive materials, and I've never had this problem until this crib."
3,"Great crib, but scratches way too easily","We recently assembled this crib and it looks great. My 17 month old son is switching to this crib in his big boy room so his new brother/sister can take over his old crib in the nursery. So far he has banged a few toys on it and it's already got several scratch marks. The wood seems very soft, so I""m sceptical as to how this crib will hold up through my son's toddler years. Other than that we really like it."
4,Great bed highly recommend,"I bought this crib & have used it from newborn & now my son is 2 1/2. He is still using it as a crib because he hasn't tried to climb out yet (the crib railings are quite high which is great). However, when he does decide to try and climb out this crib converts to a bed, perfect! I have enjoyed this bed and highly recommend it to all. It is quite big & decent quality. I assembled it & then had to take it apart and put it back together after moving overseas & is still in good condition."
1,"Crib got with missing hardware, twice!!","I got the crib and the hardware was missing. I had to wrap all the pieces again, pay for a box to ship it box. Got the replacement crib 2 days later and hardware is missing again. This time i went to home depot and pay extra for buying screws. Huge hassle and waste of time!!!"
2,Not so sturdy,"I expected the product to be lot more sturdy. I purchased based on the reviews posted earlier, however I was a little disappointed with the sturdiness of the crib. It is definitely good looking and get VERY easily scratched. By the time I was done with the assembly it had a lot of scratches. Little disappointed with the product."
5,Awesome!,I purchased the ebony colored crib and also the dresser. The wood materials seem heavy duty and the crib is very strong and well made. The option to convert from crib to toddler to full sized bed is well worth it vs having to buy three different beds. The head and foot board of the crib have a nice sleigh bed style with curves. The feet of the crib is that similar to high end expensive cribs. I would def suggest this crib to others.
2,Fatal flaw: no storage underneath the crib!,"The crib is solid enough and fairly easy to install, however, the front rail is fixed so low that it is impossible to slide anything underneath to store it. For example, we have another crib that we store boxes of diapers and wipes underneath. Look at the clearance on the lower front frame, you can't slide anything more than like 5 inches underneath..."
4,Good purchase,"After a meticulous research, we finally found a sturdy, non-smelly, easy to assemble and good to look crib for our newborn.We highly recommend this product:-)"
5,The best baked beans,"B&M is the best brand of baked beans; far superior to Bush's. Try them, most stores still carry them. I was raised on B&M but had switched to Bush's for a while because they seem to have taken over the market. Just switched back to B&M...forgotten how great baked beans are."
3,Not a thriller,"I expected to read a thriller, it was even more intriguing.Years have passed but the case is still involving and the mystery has not been solved. Anyway I believe in Claus von Bulow's innocence."
1,MediaJERK,"MediaWerk...Should call himself MediaJERK. Some of his items are dropshipped from a third party and take almost a month to receive. Some items are never shipped. Regardless, he will not answer your emails. He loads his own feedback rating with false positives. He needs to be removed from Amazon. This is why I always hesitated buying from an individual."
1,didn't play sent back,sent back did not make it here for the little girls birthday it took 3 weeks the mailing process took that long when I finally got the package I already bought the little girl something else. Sent it back. They are going to refund and that is good they were sorry they did mail it out on March 19 but I did not receive it till April 7 and I had order March 11 oh well I will still try to order I don't usually have problems and this was the mail system not the company. I am sure this product was fine I did not open or play it so do not know about product. thanks
2,An off night for Dave and the boys,"Having seen Dave and the Guilty Men a dozen times or so in recent years, I feel qualified to say that this CD does not document one of their better performances. I don't know if appearing on ACL for the first time made Dave and the boys nervous, but a listless, tentative air pervades almost the entire set. Rick Shea's overbearing lap steel drowns out the other instruments; the usually reliable Bobby Lloyd Hicks' drumming is downright sloppy in spots; and Dave has some glaring vocal misfires during his ill-conceived ""Cupid"" interlude in ""Border Radio."" This album also contains the most lackluster version of ""Fourth of July"" I've ever heard. The band only really comes to life on ""Marie Marie""--unfortunately, the CD's final song. Save your sixteen bucks and see the Dave and crew when they come to your town instead."
3,Just not enough,"I have been a fan for a long long time, since the Blasters days. I was looking forward to the CD and DVD, I saw it reviewed in Vintage Guitar Mag. As it was recorded on Austin City Limits the recording tries to please people that are interested in more of a roots rock type set, like rockabilly. When playing the rock songs there is that honky-tonk piano sound, clanking on the high register. I can take a bit of this but to hear it over and over is a pain. I think Alvin is a great ballad songwriter and when presented acoustically it is great. Consequently there was not enough of these types of songs presented. I would suggest getting the CD for your collection but depending what body of Alvin's work you enjoy you may be less that pleased."
3,Take some NO-DOZE,"I am a BIG Dave Alvin and Blasters fan and have been for 25 years. The songs chosen to be played here are on the mellow side of the tracks. Big mistake. A couple of the songs lean towards the good rockin' that Dave is so good at. The rest of them will put you to sleep. The reaction of the crowd shows that most of them agree with me. If this band was anyone else, I would give it 2 stars."
4,Some Stereo Songs Missing,"I admit I am disappointed since the stereo versions of World and Words are missing from this collection (come on, now, Rhino). Otherwise, the sound quality is excellent, although the mono versions could have been skipped, and the 3 albums would then have fit on 3 CDs for a lot less $."
5,Bee Gee's Studio Albums,"This was a gift to my daughter, she said, as usual, it was wonderful like all Bee Gee's albums are."
1,RJ Smith,"Powers was a well-known writer and commentator on intelligence issues who has had valuable insights into the process of intelligence and the role of the CIA. This book was billed as a serious of essays but that is completely wrong. It is ONLY a collection of book reviews (from the late 1970s through 2002). Powers acknowledged in the introduction that the reviews ""appear here with only small changes to correct minor factual errors"" and ""they address many episodes of American intelligence history, but make no attempt to settle controversies."" It is a scam to call these ""essays."" The book is not worth even the price of shipping."
4,A very useful book!,"I have used this book both as a Student and as a Teacher for many years now. If one wants a quick reference guide to a long ago age, you could do a whole lot worse with another book."
4,Planet Waves Products,"The bridge pins are of excellent quality, as are the ""Planet Waves"" mic cables that I use almost exclusively. Unfortunately, they did not fit my particular guitar without ""slipping"". I cannot give a bad review, however, as such things happen from time to time."
2,Not as described,"Received this item yesterday. They are NOT ""high-quality boxwood, which lasts longer than ordinary plastic bridge pins"" as described on the product page. They are, in fact, plastic. They may be fine plastic pins, though I have yet to try them on my guitar to see if they even fit.This is the third time I have received an item from Amazon.com in which the description omitted crucial information or provided a description of another item entirely. Someone at Amazon.com needs to take charge and monitor the descriptions of the items they sell.Amazon.com is certainly dropping in my esteem as a reputable online merchant."
4,Good addition to the series.,"A little hit and miss, but mostly excellent. Hank Ballard, Little Richard, the Tokens, and the Dells stand out as simply terrific. If you have the series, this is a must."
2,Rural teenage insomniac's delight!,"Paula Cole just didn't have the voice to match the fancy production on this album, or vice versa. Her best lyrics are the more personal (""I am So Ordinary,"" ""Bethlehem""), but even these are far to pretentious or or amateur to have any resonance combined with the pop-ballad production they are given.When Cole attempts a poignant *statement* as in ""Black Boots"" or ""Curandisero,"" the results lack the originality, passion, or lyrical style to do justice to the politically-correct subject matter."
5,It Rocks!,"This album is so wonderful. She has this awesome spark that she lacks on the latter albums. If you want to hear Paula Cole at her best, you should definitely check this album out."
4,Adventures in Northern New Jersey,"Garson is one-of-a-kind. Bob Arsena created this blue-collar private investigator to showcase the voice skills of his repertory company, and does well with it.The writing is clever but not overdone, and the humor is accessible without being too broad. My son and I really enjoyed these over and over. I found the cassettes in the trunk of his car recently and was amazed to learn that he still listened to them, ten years later.That's staying power!"
5,Victim of Sanctiphobia and Church Politics,"This book was originally published by the Concordia Publishing House of the Lutheran Church-Missouri Synod. Although later decertified, the authors were never given concrete reasons for this extraordinary action. I found the book to be an exciting treatment of the doctrine of sanctification -- something Lutherans are not usually big on. Using numerous true to life vignettes, the author illustrate how God is at work through the Gospel both to save us by his grace, and transform us into the image of his own Son. The authors identify what they call ""the Gospel Chain"" which includes both the Gospel itself (Revelation of Jesus Christ in Scripture and Justification by grace through faith) and the Goal of the Gospel (sanctification, mission outreach, and living to the glory of God.) Lutherans who read this book may find themselves challenged, but not led astray. I recommend it!"
1,Non-Lutheran Theology written by Lutherans?,"This book shows the disfunctionality in the LCMS now that has been allowed to exist for at least 50+ years now, possibly even since 1939.The theology behind this book was rejected and termed as unbibical in the Praesidium's decision concerning false doctrine filed against one of the authors. Sad that the decision said that this most basic doctrine of Justification and Law and Gospel is not understood by the authors. So no wonder when the Lutherans took over CPH and doctrinal review they discarded this. How about Courageous Churches and Luecke's book as well.Certainly who is in seats of power in synod publishing and control makes all this happen. When are we as Lutherans going to stop playing politicas and be the confessional theologians we and our history says we are?This book is well sized up by excellent review in LOGIA."
4,enjoyable,This is a very enjoyable prduct. The only problem I have had with it thus far is the base seems a bit small making me whery of tipping it over.
1,No Good:,"This not a good movie at all.....to me and others that watched it together. We decided to change to another movie after watching this one half way through. We just couldn't take any more of it,the movie wasn't making any sense to us!!!"
1,Thanks for the Great Advice!,I had all intentions of purchasing one of these pens to use next college semester. After reading all of the good advice from the ones that have purchased it..I'm sure everyone knows that i will order one just as soon as i am finished writing in this comment box! If it would do what it was intended on doing it would be great for all of these notes that i have to keep up with. And running Windows Me to find that it is not compatible saved me alot of headaches!
4,Good but not perfect.,"This is a great device for school or office. It is suprisingly accurate and a abundunt amount of memory, but it has its flaws. For one it is not compleatly accurate. Sometimes even with perfect text quality it misinterprets what it scans. Also it gets hard to work on curved surfaces such as an open book. All in all this is a good product once you get a hang of it."
5,The best,This has to be the best handheld pen scanner I've ever used. It is much more comfortable to use compared to the Quicklink. A bit costly but worth ever cent.Ideal for students who highlight and rewrite lecture notes.
1,C-Pen 600 -- a potentially good product that does not work,"A great concept---and it really does a good job of scanning various size text pretty accurately. Nice size; feels comfortable in the hand; a few of the commands to modify text have an awkward pattern or series to them. It could be very good. PROBLEMS: 1) it shipped without the CD for the software. 2) After downloading the software, I came to realize that it is not compatible with Win ME. I have to scan text, and upload to a PC that runs Win 98 and then transfer the text to my PC. No where on the web site or in the printed material does it state this. In fact, technical support does not even OPENLY acknowledge this. 3) Since the company is in Sweden, one must relay on email----the first response took a day or so. Not bad. The second response took 3 weeks. I am still awaiting a response to the 3rd ""fix""that tech support has suggested---4 weeks later."
2,A novelty to impress your friends,"Initially I was stunned by this technology. I scanned text from books, the newspaper, nutrition information off a candy bar wrapper... all with reasonably good results. Once I started to use if for serious work, I was substantially less impressed. I had planned to collect specific data fields from a printed directory; instead of using a sheet-feed flat-bed scanner followed by heavy cut&paste, I thought I could just selectively hand-scan the needed data fields. While the OCR accuracy might be acceptable for short passages, the error frequency becomes unacceptable when more text is collected. The frequency of errors was so great that I went back to the flat-bed and cut&paste. I like the ergonomics of the unit. I am trying to figure out what I can still do this device."
1,Not worth the price; purchase a used cheaper one instead,"When I decided to cough up the $150 dollars, I expected to be amazed by it's power. I was definately wrong. The only thing I found it useful for, was containing addresses and amusing myself. If you are considering purchasing this product, I would suggest you buy it from an Amazon user for a cheaper price."
1,Very disappointing; I regret having purchased it,"I purchased the CPen 200 and regret it. Accuracy is not good enough for most purposes I have tried to use it for and I have found it much quicker to type out text manually, or even write it out by hand, than to try and scan it in and correct the errors made by the CPen. The XTNDAccess infrared connection which I needed to purchase with the device is extremely temperamental on Windows 2000, and impossible to install on Windows NT Workstation - the tech support people were downright unhelpful and refused to direct enquiries to customer services. The battery life on the device is poor and I found I had run down the batteries in only a few hours of use. If I could return the device I would; buying it was throwing money down the drain."
2,Grrrr,"I have enjoyed Clair Poulson's suspense novels in the past. The story line in this one was no different - I liked it. What bugged me and the reason I am rating it so poorly is the character Warren. The guy is a jerk, controlling and shows signs that he could become abusive. Yet Jeri excuses him because he had 'reason'. Given that she does not love him and doesn't end up with him but part of the solution to the story is that he winds up with her best friend. It bothers me to no end that he is presented as a 'good catch'. The issue of domestic abuse is serious and girls should be taught to recognize potential signs and not be encourage to rationalize it to acceptance. Although I truly enjoyed the book, this issue is so egregious the rating goes from 5 stars to 2."
5,Awesome!!,"This was the first book I had ever read by Clair Poulson, and I recomend it to anyone. It is such a touching story, but don't get me wrong, it isn't a 'dumb' story. From the begining to the end I was mesmerized. My friends and I all read it, and we all agree, this is the best of Clair's books. Filled with intruge, terror, and ...I won't say. Dont want to ruin it. But believe me, anyone will love it."
1,just plain cheesy,"I got this book at a book swap and later saw that the first 75 pages were missing. I read it anyway and found that I missed nothing at all. The writing is very amateurish with the characters doing lots of cheesy self-reflection. The end is nothing but LDS (mormon) propaganda. The main character is torn between her LDS standards and the man she loves. Lo and behold he turns to the mormon faith and all is well. Puh-leeze! This might be an okay read for a teenager, but for an adult it's pathetic and laughable."
4,Great Music,"It's too bad that Gina Leigh is no longer with this band as her vocals are outstanding on several tracks. Their take on ""Going Down South"" is the best I've ever heard. These guys must be great live. Great sound, lively music with a Mississippi/Delta flavor."
1,Where's George?,"He certainly is the ""quiet beatle"". Giuliano couldn't even find enough on George to fill a cassette. Instead we get an endlessly long press conference featuring John & Paul. George might have been there. Then another endless prattle from his discredited Yogi. This is not a tribute to anyone. It's a travesty. Giuliano is a parasite & should quit feeding off of dead Beatles who cannot defend themselves from his ilk."
5,"Huge Monitor, Tiny Price","It's hard to not be satisfied with a 22"" LCD for $200. It nicely replaced the $400 17"" monitor I bought from Alienware two years ago."
2,Oldschool Neurosis fan left hungry,"I started listening to Neurosis with the release of Pain of Mind and for a long time they were my favorite band by far. Ever since A Sun That Never Sets though I haven't really enjoyed their music very much. I still think they are awesome and unbelievably talented, but the music just doesn't drive me anymore. I miss the heavy days of Souls At Zero and Through Silver In Blood. For anyone that feels similar to me I doubt you'll really enjoy this album very much."
2,Disappointment Of The Year,"Sorry folks. I hate to say it but this album is boring to me. Except for the second track, I haven't listened to it since the first week I bought it. The second track does kill though, a glimpse of the ""crush you with one hand"" Neurosis that I used to know and love. I am a huge fan of everything they've released except the first two and this one. I must admit though, I didn't like A Sun That Never Sets at first either until I saw it live. Maybe I'll try to like it again some more and give it a few more spins. Check out the song samples, see what you think. True fans will buy it no matter what. I did. But for the most part I agree with ""A Music Fan"" ... fans of heavier stuff will hate it."
1,Shockingly Awful,It is beyond me why an author would distort history that is so interesting on its own. Sulla murdered? Octavian as Ceasar's cousin? WHY!?!? I couldn't agree more with a previous reviewer's advice to avoid this author in favor of Colleen McCollough's Masters of Rome series. This book is beyond terrible!
5,Excellent Read,"This is great historical fiction. The author does a great job combining fact with fiction to weave a great story. At the end of his books, the author lets us know which content in the book was fact and which was fiction. So all the reviewers complaining about the book not being accurrate need to read this part of the book. It's presented as historical fiction by the author not historical fact."
5,Emperor The Death of Kings,"If you've read any of Iggulden's other works you'll know his style: he takes history, applies creative licence, and generates a thrilling story. The four books in the Emperor series need to be read as a series, and in order to get the overall story.... but they're good stuff."
5,Fantastic Book,"The entire series 'Emperor',including 'The Death of Kings',are very exciting and well-written.It's true that Iggulden made many changes from the original story but I believe the most important thing is to understand the character of Julius Caesar and of Marcus Brutus,and how life was at the time.The author takes us close to the characters and the story is so vivid that you can't stop reading..For me,the most interesting thing in the series is the relationship of the two friends and how they changed during the years."
5,HISTORICAL FICTION MEANS HISTORICAL FICTION,"Some times real history is boring and we want to hear what we want to hear. Like for instance the Gettysburg address is considered one of the greatest speeches in American History, but woud you like to hear that when Linclon gave the speech, hardly anyone was moved, they were soaking wet from satnding listening to Websters 4 hour long speech and they were too tired and wet to even care. But in history class, you dont hear that because nobody wants to know. And I hate to admit it to you but in the back of the book there is a list of things the author changed. Did you not see that somehow, if you want to learn real history fo to school, but if you want enjoy some bits of history in a great read, buy this book. I read it twice in a week, and ive read it 5 times since then."
2,Lions and Tigers and Bears! Oh my!,"Now look, even the most pedantic of historians or history buffs must allow novelists to tweak the facts to aid their plots. BUT there is a line once crossed that passess from tweaking to revising. If this book had presented itself as a revisionist historical novel--then fine it's a decent enough read. The question I always have for this type of excess (when not labeled as such) is why-when the actual facts are just as intriquing or exciting? The fact that after-the-fact the author fesses up doesn't dispel the annoyance and disruption that occurs when the knowledgeable and true-history-loving reader is reading. If you care about history and historical figures at the level that most of the reviewers seem to, then its a good enough read-so enjoy. If you truly care-read if you want, but be afraid-be very afraid."
5,Excellent Read,"I really enjoyed this book. The second in Iggulden's Emperor trilogy, I found the pace to be exciting and the story engrossing. The character development is clear and interesting, and not too over the top as you sometimes find in this type of story. Great stoyline and action.I have been reading a lot of historical fiction about Rome, and this has been the most enjoyable read so far. Still getting into some of the older books of this type, but can't wait to read the 3rd in the series.Highly recommend."
5,A Great Historical Novel,"I say novel because it is precisely that. A wonderfully detailed and fairly accurate portrayal of ancient Rome. True, Iggulden takes liberties with many facts (or creates some fiction) but the book overall is a page turner that is hard to put down. I am an avid student of ancient history and truly enjoyed this book as a story set in my favorite period of time. It is in the style of Pressfield's ""Gates of Fire"" or ""Tides of War"", but a bit more gritty and realistic considering the time. I have recommended this book to many friends and all have reported that it was so good they bought the series."
2,Not bad if you don't mind alternate histories....,"Somewhat entertaining, and I give any author credit for writing a readable story, but as far as Julius Caesar's life goes, this ongoing series is more of an alternate version than anything else - just keep that in mind.Those more interested in a much more historically-accurate, as well as meticulously-researched and vivdly-detailed series on Caesar and/or the fall of the Roman Republic should read Colleen McCullough's ""Masters of Rome"" series, in which Caesar's life begins midway through the 3rd book, ""Fortune's Favorites""."
2,To Many Liberties With History,"There are so many better books in this genre.While one must suspend belief with much of the dialogue put into the mouths of the great men of history, it is unforgivable how the author changes well documented important events.Cato is killed during the Spartacus rebellion by Pompey? No he lived for many years more, died in Africa and should be a MAJOR character in the next books in the series - except the author has decided to kill him off. Ridiculous.Caesar personally kills Mithridates during a great battle the same year he escaped from pirates??? No such thing happened.There are many other major changes in History that make this mediocre book and series a must avoid."
1,Diabolically bad : pity we cant give negative stars....,"This is grim stuff. One of the things that attracts me to Caesar is that his (extremely well documented) life reads like an adventure novel. A straightforward novelisation works well.The ""history"" in this book is so laughably bad, so poorly linked to the reality, so flagrant with its driving of coaches and horses through the fabric of reality that its almost amusing.Avoid this like the plague."
1,Ops...he did it again,"Unfortunately Soemone gave me a copy og this book.I read half8 Im somewhat of a masochist) Its a book foro children, with a plot too simple, and with so many liberties taken in real history that it should be forbidden to be read by children befor they lear about the roman empire..."
1,Has ruined other Iggulden books for me,"After reading the entire Khan series and enjoying it thoroughly I thought why not give the Ceasar books a try. They had to be as good, right? Wrong! One howlingly bad historical error after another interspersed with some stab-in-the-dark guesswork totally ruined this book for me and now has me wondering how really bad was the Khan series? Honestly, if you want a mostly accurate history of Sulla, Marius and Julius read Colleen McCullough's Masters of Rome series or Robert Harris's Cicero trilogy, not this drivel."
5,Quick and Easy,"This drive is very portable and quickly adds on a good amount of storage. Although it only spins at 4200 RPMs, it's high speed connection is good and it's hard to notice is slow unless you are filling the drive in one shot. Since this is USB powered, it's makes it very travel friendly and I can breath a sigh of relief that I know where all my data is. It comes with a PS2 power option as well. Nice job SmartDisk."
5,Excellent harddrive,Great for backing up pictures and music files. That's all I use it for. No issues on Windows XP with a Dell Inspiron 600m.
1,flaky -don't buy,"i got two of these inexpensive drives. they are cheap!!!both of those work on and off on an ibm laptop. never worked on an imac (2007).bought those for a friend and my daughter so they back-up their data/photos/songs ... big mistake, both (both! what are the odds?) are terribly unreliable. what a waste of time and money.NEVER again."
1,Great Product until it crashes,"I have had the FLBUSB80-C model for 2 years. It worked fine with my desk top PC, several laptops and my Epson P3000. Then, recently I plugged it into the USB port and got the message that the unit isn't recognized. It had been sitting undisturbed on my desk since its last use. I tried it on another desktop unit and on 2 laptop units where I had used it successfully in the past. Same message. I hear the disk spin up when I hold it to my ear. The product's website offers useless ""help"" information. I used it for photo backups. As a product it was a great idea for that purpose. With such a short unpredictable lifespan, I can't recommend it for anything, other than the trash."
3,Mac G4 laptop doesn't provide enough power thru USB,"I've used a 40G Smart disk with Firewire for several years and it works great. I needed a larger drive for my music collection and since I only have one FW port on my Mac G4 laptop I got this USB model. It just spins and chirps because it doesn't have enough power through the USB port. It would probably work great on any desktop or a more recent Mac laptop. The product is great and I recommend it otherwise. Also, their return policy is fast, easy and done online. UPS picked up the package the next day without question."
1,very bad,I researched hard drives and portable hard drives for two months. This is the only on that had no bad reviews. It died two days after I completed my Itunes transfer. Lost 22gb of Itunes. I was told by MFG that some electronic devices just quit. I did get a full refund from Amazon.
1,Very Disappointed,Received Firelite portable as a gift and while it worked on my Mac G5 desktop it didn't work on either a Toshiba notebook or Apple Powerbook. This has to be more then a coincedence since a similar drive by CMS works perfectly on all three machines without the need for an adaptor. The support offered by the Smartdisk site did not resolve the problem.
1,Doesn't work with Mac G4!!,"Beware those of you who try to use this device with a Mac Powerbook G4. It doesn't work. Mine didn't work , and SmartDisk customer support told me the device would not work with any Powerbook G4!Grrr"
5,The Good Beer Book,"You want a beer book? This is the ONE. This book made me want to drink beer while reading every other book Harper has written! Things I never knew about the subject told in a clever, insightful and always interesting style. I was never a beer lover until I read this - the author opend up a whole new world of drinking pleasure by introducing me to a wide range of really good, and really different brews. This ain't Schlitz! My husband and I are on a mission to check out all the great drinking places he recommends - so far, Harper's right on the money."
4,Great book,"I am a huge ""barleyjuice"" lover and this book helped me to further understand the different styles and their origins. I also enjoyed the author's opinions and comments in each section. This made the book more personal and not like a text book. I walked away feeling a whole lot smarter about beer....that was my goal."
4,"Very solid, easy to put together","I was impressed by the weight of the shelves, they would hold much more than the DVR, Playstation 3, and Bose 28 system, that I have on them.It was extremely easy to put together, took about 15 minutes while I was watching TV. The unit is really stable and I had room with the pre-cut holes for all the cables and wires to fit easily.The one problem was my own fault. The unit is pretty tall and just fit under my wall mounted LG TV. It was so close I couldn't put my DVR on the top shelf, had to put the bose system there...not a big deal.Also, unit is a little deeper than I need, but other people with large components may find this a plus.Overall, really pleased, should last forever."
4,It's Great!,"We love this stand. It is just perfect for holding the TiVo, DirecTV box, surround sound system and dvd player when your TV stands on its own."
4,Precautions on assembly,"Becareful when you unpack the shelving materials. There are 8 circular styrofoam spacers on two square sheets of styrofoam that look like packing material. You could easily damage the styrofoam if you don't notice them. Other than that, the table was very easy to assemble. It looks great and seems to be very strong."
5,A very good product.,"I assembled it in 10 minutes, clean contemporary look. I have a 32 in. LCD TV on top, a VCR, a DVD player, a 200 CD changer and an amplifier and they all fit beautifully. I am considering buying an additional shelf just to add a bit more storage and to heighten the TV (my kids are always blocking my view!) and this would save me from wall-mounting the TV though this is a great height now. I also thought I'd be bothered by having all my electronics visible and considered an enclosed unit, but this stand unites the look, is not as overbearing as some units that ""hide"" media equipment, and just looks sleak."
5,Great Product for the money,"I've had seven different stereo systems in the last 30 years and my amplifier weights 50 pounds and so does my cd player and this rack is the strongest I've had for the least amount of money, and it took me only 30 minutes to put it together. I love it !!"
5,Solid Stand,I just received the stand today and had it set up in about fifteen minutes. I use mine for my audio system and I have no fear putting expensive components on it. All the pieces fit together snugly and it gives you a good feeling of strength and stability. If the need ever arises for more rack space I would definitely get another one of these.
3,Subject to change?,"The unique texture of this product caught my eye and persuaded me to seek more. After doing my ""research"" I dealt myself to buy one and drifted towards a new unit. When received in the mail, I assembled the unit and after 24 hours, only 50 pounds of force, the unit collapsed. Now, feeling that this must be an unknown error, I returned it and received another unit. The same thing happened, yet again.So, this may just be a ""luck of the darn draw"", but it sure was some bad luck."
2,No inside seal and 2 tablets were missing.,"I ordered 2 Source Naturals GliSODin Power 250mg, 60 tablets from Nutricity on amazon.com.The first container seemed to be fine so I never counted the tablets. When I opened the second container there was no seal inside the cap and two tablets were missing. I counted 58 when there should have been 60. The tablets all looked the same.I do not know if this is a Source Naturals problem or a Nutricity problem?"
1,overcharge,"I subscribed to this product at a discount price of about $18.80. However, when I received the product, my credit card was charged nearly doubled. Called Amazon, the Rep told me that the supplier had increased the price. I asked why they did not inform me. She said ""no idea"".Be careful with the subscription price!"
2,Worst wrestler to get over...EVER,"I will have to agree with the last reviewer, Hulk is and never will b known as a great wrestler...In my eyes he flat out stunk but he did have tons of charisma and quit frankly i dont think anybody else but him would have been able to propel wrestling to the heights he did...thats the only credit he gets..there were tons of guys back in the days that would put on better matches but with less hype of course...so to say Hogan was the best, well then ur smokin some superduper high grade ish!!!Bottom line..if u cant get enough of mid 80's to early 90's wrestling then get it, even if its all hogan matches..lmao....weeeeeeeee"
5,born hulkamaniac turned game,"Hulk Hogan is one of the best wrestlers, yes this is true, but the wrestlers of today will be the hulks and rics of tomorrow. Not to mention that ric flair is also one of the best wrestlers in the world. One of the reviews urged people to read hulk hogans book. I urge people to read ric flair's book and see hulk hogan through someone else's eyes. He isn't the humblest guy in the world..."
1,why?????,"off topic about the dvd but since this is about hogan, why do people talk so much crap about the warrior for having no wrestling skills but praise hogan. warrior gimmick was so much more entertaining. other then no showing the warrior in my eye was a better superstar then hogan (probly going to get flamed for that)"
3,Poor Match Selection,"Here's my one major problem with this DVD set. Many of the matches are already available on other DVDs. The WrestleMania matches can be found on the WrestleMania Box Set, and ""Greatest Wrestlers of the 1980s"" and ""Hulk Still Rules"" has many of the same matches.My question is this: Where are all the great Saturday Night's Main Event matches? How about some good MSG house show matches as well?Hogan had some really good fueds in the 80s that didn't get a lot of television exposure. Matches against Greg Valentine, Ted DiBiase, Rick Rude, Big Bossman, Killer Khan, ""King"" Harley Race and others made good money at house shows and have appeared in the old VHS format on Coliseum Video's old ""Hulkamania"" series (for those of us old enough and lucky enough to own some of those!)As far as the PPV matches go, hopefully the WWE will release SummerSlam, Royal Rumble, and Survivor Series sets similar to the WrestleMania set. If so, why bother putting them on this set too?"
3,Rather Humdrum to say the least !,"This wasn't a book that was exactly a page turner. The characters of Martin, John and Caroline live rather humdrum lives, obvious as to why they have to take so many drugs. Some funny situations, especially the one where Martin snorts his roomates toenail filings thinking that it is cocaine. Overall, not a book I would recommend very highly. Haven't read any other works by Burston and don't know if I will in the future. He is a good writer, however this story just didn't do it for me."
3,"Good, but what's the point?","This book was mildly entertaining, but overall it is something I could have easily done without. That's not to say it's bad. It is written well enough, you get to know the characters adequately and the story is pretty interesting along the way, but by the end it's sort of like peering into the lives of a few random Londoners for a period of time. At most this book will make you want to start up a drug habit (with the exception of one non-fatal OD, this book paints a rather flattering picture of drug use, one that is at least more accurate than what you learn in DARE), and I found most of the humor revolved around that. This isn't a book to avoid, but perhaps one I wouldn't put at the top of your list either."
1,Huge Disappointment,"I paid 12.00 for this silly toy. Add on shipping and handling, and it came to over 20.00. It looks and feels like something out of a 50 cent gumball machine. It is so small I could hide it in the palm of one hand. I have seen better quality from happy meal toys."
2,Quite difficult to follow,"Although at the beginning the book seems to be really helpful for those wanting to learn Kana and Kanji it turns out to be extremely difficult. Especially the Kanji (which is presented in Chapters 3 and 4) is presented in a way that only fluent Japanese speakers can follow, i.e. tha Kanji is sorted in categories by number of strokes and difficulty and not by meaning which would be easier for a Beginner). The Kana Sextion of the book though (Chapter 2) is quite good, giving all the necessary guidelines that one must follow to manage Kana. In general it's a satysfying book only if you already have a good experience in Japanese."
3,long,the shipping was quick and it was a good copy. The book itself was very very long and seemed to drone on.
2,Fictitious slander,"The ""documentary"" had good information overall with good narrative however, one female speaker made the false claim that ""even Lincoln owned slaves"". This false statement may have been a popular myth among southerners at the time but it is a lie. The narrator does not indicate it as a myth but as a fact. As a documentary, it gives the impression of truth. There should have been a subtitle or a following note that clarified the remark as propaganda. To leave it in the documentary in its present state would be the same as giving credit to a holocaust denier in a history film. As I said, this was a nice effort overall but, now I have to fact check every single thing to see what else was fabricated."
2,toss out the other reviews - read this first,Hate to throw water on the parade here.. but as a fan of earlier volumes.. this one is flat out awful. Its like a cross of new age jazz and flat beats with a little bossa nova mixed in. Really dissapointed in where this series has gone - there is really no need to venture outside the single digits i.e. volumes 5-9 with this series.. believe me.
1,Don't buy it! Fourth mixer died after 6 months....,I have replaced 4 mixers during two years. They usually work three to six months and motor dies. Mixer was used every 2-3 weeks for mixing light dough. Is it Bad luck ??
3,A question of speed,"I have a problem with the description of this mixer. I do not appreciate expecting 12 speeds to find out that I really only have 6 speeds. When I called the company and asked them what was up, Hamilton Beach explained that there were 12 speeds and every time I clicked into a new speed, I was advancing 2 speeds instead of one! It is marked on the head of the mixer 2-4-6-8-10-12. Those dashes are NOT another speed in between the 6 numbers.Not that I really NEEDED 12 different speeds. If I was rating the mixer itself instead of comparing it with the product description, I would give it 4 stars. I have had my mixer for about a month now and it has done everything that I have asked of it and done it well."
2,Mixer didn't make it.,"I returned the mixer. It was advertised as 4 qt. capacity, but it couldn't possibly operate with 4 qt. of contents. The 4 qt. was absolutely to the brim of the bowl. It couldn't handle a small batch of bread. The dough went over the beater and had to be stopped and poked down all the time. The mixer might be OK for cake recipes and other light duty~definitely NOT for bread, which was my primary need."
1,DOA and poor Amazon customer service,"The mixer was dead on arrival. Packed it up and tried to arrange an exchange. Exact exchange supposedly not available for over a month. Exchange for a different color is not allowed and I was told to just set up a return and order the item in a different color. I cancel the order and go to re-order in a different color. Oh, but wait, the promtional code isn't available now. Trying to work this out with Amazon through alleged customer service was a nightmare. The comment in an earlier review about the red being more pink is just about right on. I'd say it is more of a light purple, but it is definitely not the red you see in the photos."
4,Nice Mixer,"I enjoy this mixer, but I miss being able to scrape the sides. It does the job well, however. You just need to stop it and lift the head before scraping - sometimes a pain. I got it for a great price, so you get what you pay for in terms of capabilities."
4,How do I release the attachments?,"I'm really liking this product so far...quiet, doesn't move around even after I put felt pads on the bottom so it can slide easily on my counter top and it's not as big or ugly looking as the Kitchen Aid. As others have mentioned, the splatter guard just gets in the way so I don't use it. My only problem - and I couldn't find this in the manual - is ""is there an easier way to unhook the attachments other than to undo them by getting my hands all messed up with whatever I just mixed?"" My hand mixer has a release button so I can just flip the beaters into the kitchen sink. Thanks for any responses."
4,"Hamilton Beach Stand Mixer, #63227","Finally here is a stand mixer in the affordable price range. For years, these ""must have"" items have been on the higher end, price-wise. I found this item to be equal in performance to the higher priced units. I found the unit and the attachments to be of a sturdy quality. I lost count of the number of Christmas cookies that were made from the amount of cookie dough my neighbor and I made in one week."
2,"Built well, but doesn't mix bottom. Poor customer service.","We bought this instead of the Kitchen Aid; it looked like it was very well built and the price was right. Wish we had bought the Kitchen Aid [this replaced an old Kitchen Aid]. The beaters do not come close to the bottom of the bowl, always leaving an unmixed area. There is no adjustment for it. When I contacted their customer service about it, they were not concerned about it and of no help, so I would rate their customer service even lower than the usefulness of this appliance. It's about ready to go to the Goodwill and get a mixer that works. Stick with Kitchen Aid... they work the way that they are supposed to."
3,Good enough to make bread,"I just bought this mixer from Amazon. Truthfully, the mixer is pretty average. Makes dough well enough which is the acid test. For buttercream icing I had to scrape the bowl a couple of times but otherwise consistency was good. Only complaint I have is the rebate from Hamilton Beach was misleading since it is available if you buy more than one product. Thankfully, Amazon has an instant $25 off when you buy this so ends up costing about $145 which is the cheapest stand mixer you'll get for the quality. KitchenAid's cheapest mixer is $170 but I don't know how well it will operate. There is also Kenwood but it is not widely available in USA. However, that seems to have the best reviews from people I know. Hope this helps anyone looking for a stand mixer."
5,Love it!,"I bought this mixer for my dad. I have a Kitchenaid but the reviews liked this model better for bread making, my dad's passion, I agree. He is really happy with it and I used it last weekend and I love it. It is great and bonus, $100 cheaper than the Kitchenaid. It would be nice if it had the capability for some grinder, pasta, etc, attachments but really, I buy my sausage and pasta so......"
2,Only worked for 7 months,I purchased this mixer 7 months ago and only used it maybe 10-15 times total to make cakes and mash potatoes. All of a sudden the speed regulator stopped working and no matter what speed I put it on it mixes as if it was on 12. I had to scrape potatoes off the walls because when I put the mixer on # 2 it started mixing so fast everything flew out of the ball. Will be calling HB to replace it within the warranty. I'm only afraid that they would send me a refurbished unit that will stop working too. Fingers crossed. I wish I had purchased Kitchen Aid instead.
5,Best mixer around!,"Bought this Hamilton Beach All-Metal Stand Mixer about a month ago. Love it! Was looking at Kitchen Aide, but the price was a bit more than I wanted to pay since I don't use it real often. This mixer is great! Not the least bit sorry, and would highly recommend. Also, shipping was very fast. Totally satisfied!"
2,Not for dough!,"I make a 1 pound whole wheat loaf of bread once a week. The mixer head wobbles terribly during the 7 minutes of kneading and the mixer tries to walk off the counter. Under this light load, the first mixer lasted less than 1 year before the bolt holding the head to the base snapped in half. Hamilton Beach replaced the mixer. I figured it was just a fluke. It's not a fluke. The replacement mixer is doing the same thing and I'm now smelling a strong odor of ozone from the motor head.VERY disappointing considering the fact that HB states that the mixer can handle the lightest egg whites to the stiffest dough! When the current mixer fails, I will be buying a Kitchen Aid."
4,I like it!,"We had an ancient Kitchen Aid and I loved it... but always had to store it in the cupboards since it was so big and clunky. Our daughter now has it and is happy with it. We bought the Hamilton Beach mixer and I like it almost as much as the Kitchen Aid. The best thing about it is that the mixer lifts up, making things a bit easier. The only slight complaint I have is that the medium to high speed is a big jump... it's a little too fast for what I want, most of the time. Another plus is that it sits beautifully on my counter!"
3,OK but,"I purchased the Hamilton Beach after my KitchenAide stand mixer stripped its gears (which were not metal but some plastic or such) doing a whole wheat bread dough. Repair would have been about $100 so I figured more plastic gears I do not need. The Hamilton Beach mixer handled the whole wheat bread dough with no problem but the motor assembly did move side to side (as was described by a previous buyer). I returned the unit and promptly received a new one which I will be using shortly. Hopefully the new one will not have this movement, or it may just be normal."
5,Great product,Love this mixer works great!! Very fast shipping and decent price. Comes with warranty that's always great news. The cover keeps me from having chocolate everywhere deff recommend;)
3,Note on Apple Color,"Hamilton Beach Eclectrics 63224 All-Metal Stand Mixer, AppleI just received my Apple Hamilton Beach Stand Mixer and, while I cannot comment yet on the performance, just wanted to forewarn anyone who may be under the impression that this is a ""cheery"" shade of green. It is closer in shade to what those of us born in the 50-60's know as ""avocado"". I also got the toaster in the same shade. The color is not offensive, merely not anywhere near the citron shade it appears to be on the web. It has, on the first try, delivered the most evenly browned toast I've ever made in a toaster. Be aware that the toaster (as other posters have mentioned) is not classically shaped (not readily apparent in the photo)--- it slopes downward toward the controls. Looks very nice -- but you may want to know that. As always, it was delivered by Amazon at warp-speed."
3,Mixer,"I'm disappointed. The machine is well made, but I like the old fashoned kind with the two beaters. This one seems hard to get all the ingredients scraped from the sides and mixed. I've only used it once and may get used to it, but the two beater machine I learned to cook with was so good to mix with the least amount of side scraping. The bowl of the two beater mixer moved around as it beat. I didn't even find a two beater machine while shopping. Aunt Mildred's two beaters would even un-hook from the base to make wonderful beaten white icing over boiling water in the double boiler. Oh well.... I'll try it some more and if I just don't feel it's worth the counter space, give it away. I do think it's probable the best of it's kind and a best buy of it's kind. I'm just disappointed."
3,Too big for small kitchen,"I didn't even use this mixer - sent it back right away. It is very large; the mixer head is NOT removable, so you will have to have a lot of room to store it. I'm sure the mixer performs as it should if you have the room in your kitchen to keep it."
3,price is good but kid is better,"I bought a kid and just time i saw this, so i return kid choice this. my opinion kid still better. When this one working, sound terrible let me feel it will be damage soon.if money no problem. go to buy kid. Trust me!"
3,Should have invested in a better machine,I chose this mixer because I had a limited budget. For light weight mixing at lower speeds it's fine. At faster speeds the head shakes back and forth more than I think a mixer is supposed to shake. It really can't handle dough. The motor on mine burnt out within one year. If I had to do it all again I would have invested in a better machine.If all you want is the ease of a stand mixer instead of a hand held one and don't have heavy duty mixing jobs then this is a fine machine but if you need a sturdy stand mixer you might want to choose something else.
3,No Complete Mixing,"Overall, I am pleased to use the Hamilton Beach stand mixer. It does a lot of the work that I used to do and now do not have the strength to do, like mixing cookie and cake batters. The one flaw in the product is that it does not thoroughly mix. For example, when mixing butter and sugar, there is a layer of unmixed butter along the sides and bottom of the bowl. I have to lift the beater out and hand-mix it before adding the flour. I consider this enough of a detriment to rate the product as ""ok"" rather than very good."
5,Outstanding Book That Should be Required Reading!,"Disregard the inflammatory sounding title; this is not an Ann Coulter unsubstantiated rant-and-rave. Instead, this book is a much needed measured and rational look at history and racial/cultural issues. It is a breath of fresh air to read Sowell's examination of facts which disregards political agendas and ""correctness."" The book should be required reading for high schools and colleges and, if not the whole book, at least the chapters ""The Real History of Slavery"" and ""History versus Visions."" No matter what your convictions, beliefs, or political party, you should read this informative book!"
5,Great History Lessons,"This is the most inclusive book I've read about this the history of slavery and anti-semitism. It goes back hundreds of years and to other countries (not just the U.S.) where slavery existed. He points out that slavery existed long before the U.S. was a country and - contrary to liberal rants - in many non-Western countries. Actually, the U.S. was the first country to begin outlawing slavery and has used it's influence in the world to outlaw it in other countries. He also points out that more blacks sold blacks into slavery than white people ever did.His discussion about the prosperity of Jews and the resultant anti-semitism was the best I've ever read. I learned more in this book than I did in any history class in high school or college!A MUST BUY!"
5,READ and UNDERSTAND THIS BOOK!! Insist your children read and understand it.,"In this Book, Dr. Sowell has provided historical precedent and well documented reason for virtually everything I've felt true about our society but until now had only instinct and the anecdotal evidence before my eyes as the basis for my belief. That's a pretty encompassing statement, but it's true. Virtually every paragraph of this book is revealing and delivers body blow after body blow to long held beliefs and socially accepted notions of ""history"" which have done so much to damage our society over the last half century. Thomas Sowell is without peer as a historical sociologist and in this book, he lays bare the facts against the politically correct social holograms we are spoon-fed every day. It is my intent to commit this book to memory and to see to it that anyone for whom I care reads it and understands its meaning."
5,Must read.,"Just finished this and provides great perspective on the devisive issue and politics of race in America. Sowell is a favorite author of mine. This book is well reasearched and footnoted. It is excellent counterpoint to Obama's twisted, anti-colonial view and redistribution agenda. The information from the book was helpful before viewing the movie ""2016"". I particulaly like the section on Germans & Germany, a people who are forever stained by the Holocaust, for which most Germans had no involvement. I purchased the book because I wanted a more complete picture of the history of slavery throughout the world, not just the slavery in colonial America, which from most books, movies, & educators try convincing you it all began & ended in the American South. In Sowell's book you will find a more comprehensive coverage of this reprehensible practice."
5,More compelling arguments from Dr. Sowell,"This exhaustively researched tome explodes the usual stereotypes and myths that liberals have been promulgating in colleges and journals. Dr. Sowell uses logic and research to show the misconceptions about slavery in America, Germans and middleman minorities. With many compelling arguments, it's difficult to find any verisimilitude in other books on the same subjects."
4,"A bit dry, but the ideas are well developed.","Sowell will probably not win a writing award any time soon (his style is a bit too academic for what is meant to be a layman's read), but the ideas he articulates are well developed. The basic premise that black culture is the primary cause behind the achievement disparity between the black and non-black US population is well supported by research data and anecdotal evidence.The timeliness of the correlations between the 1960's equal rights movement and the general decline in prosperity of the US black population is particularly striking. Sowell makes a strong argument for an introspective look at the problems holding back progress among members of this group.Even if you take offense at the notion of internal-causes to the problems of the US black population, Sowell is worth reading in order to understand the broader context in which the debate should be framed."
4,"Insightful, but not convincing","I think the book was rather insightful, but I am not convinced of it's conclusions. For those with open minds it is a very good read, but if you already lean one way or the other you'll either take everything as fact and beyond reproach or you'll ignore the many insightful conclusions Sowell provides. It's a good book, and good for those who can think critically about what they read. I'd recommend it."
5,A true history lesson for all,"This book by one of the great authors of our time will open your eyes to truths about not only the history of this country, but to the sociology of our planet. It will empower you with knowledge on how to change the future for yourself and our nation by better understanding our history and why things have gotten to the mess we are in. If I were President I would put Thomas Sowell in charge of the Education Department tomorrow and make this book required reading in every school in the country."
1,"Yeah, right","The main problem with this thesis, aside from the fact that it is yet another attempt to blame everything on the South, is that these pathologies did not manifest until the northern migration. Gangs, disintegrating families, epidemic drug and alcohol abuse, rampant illegitimacy all occurred after Blacks moved north and were plugged into the welfare state. Part of the reason Blacks are returning South is that they are more comfortable there, have more in common with white Southerners than hypocritical yankees, and fit comfortably into a culture of faith. At least he is trying to look out of the box....but blaming ANYBODY at this stage of the game is not part of the solution. Its the problem."
1,A black man defends slavery!,"Basically, Sowell belives that A)Urban black culture is a result of interaction with poor white trash; B)Slavery wasn't really a racial thing; C)Other minority groups who exploit urban blacks are, in fact, providing a valuable socio-economic service; and D)Blacks need to stop living in the past and blaming whites for their problems.He brings to mind that blind black man on Chappelle who was a white supremacist. Only, Chappelle's version was more entertaining."
4,Eye Opening Reading,An excellent collection of thought provoking essays from one of the top minds in American academia. Dr. Sowell blows through our presuppositions and media driven stereotypes. His unique way of examining the root causes and historical foundation of today's most difficult issues is eye opening to say the least. I recommend his work to anyone that has a desire to better understand economics and society in general.
5,Who Woulda Thunk?!?!?,"Simple American history we were never taught in school! It's factual, and explains everything us ""Northerners"" could never figure out about the ""Southern"" mentality and ""Black"" lifestyle from WWII through today. Mr. Sowell does the world a service with this book. It should be a mandatory text in every American high school. If the adult population read it, our ""racial"" conflicts would disappear in a heart-beat. This book goes a long way to help us understand the issues that don't seem to go away."
5,Lo mejor,"Es lo más importante libro en todo el mundo. Si hay un libro que debes leer antes que mueras, este es el libro!"
4,"We're the sci-fi club, we're here to save you...","This was a neat film. Zombies infest the prom with some quirks and humor. If you've ever been a nerd/geek/etc, you will appreciate this movie. Its a typical zombie flick. Zombie movie fans will delight at this one. I reccommend this one if you like zombie movies for sure, and general horror fans should get a kick out of it also."
2,Not too bad,"For a straight to video zombie horror/comedy this wasn't too bad. It was, of course, pretty silly and not a serious zombie flim but it was fun for a a few laughs. The special effects were a little better than most."
5,Dance of The Dead (DVD),"At first, I thought this movie would be like ""Final Exam"" or ""Cutting Class, or one of the earlier ""kids gone berserk on parents and teachers"" thrillers. BUT IT WASN'T! The acting is great, and the plot well-done. I especially liked the scene when the students and parents turn up at the Alien/Teacher's house! I won't spoil it by giving away the scene, but it was great!I recommend this movie to those to like a bit of SciFi,with a unique twist, and original acting. The cast is great and did a fine acting job."
4,Fun with Zombies,I really enjoyed this movie - it reminded me a lot of the teen flicks of the 80's like Breakfast Club but with the Living Dead thrown into the mix. It was a lot of fun with enough gore to satisfy zombie fans while still managing to throw in a lot of just for laughs moments. The characters include all the stereotypical high school types who end up having to work together to stop the zombies and in the process learn to like each other. Ghost House Pictures has really done an excellent job with this one. I'm looking forward to checking out the other Ghost House Underground films.
1,Don't waste your time.,The comments on the box made it sound like it was a goof and would be fun.I like camp films but this is so dumb that I could not finish it.This thing looks like a Junior High School film project (Grade D-).The script could have been written by a ten year old and the acting is as much fun as watching a congressional vote on stamps on C span. The Vombie effects are a joke.I paid $4 for this and feel really ripped off.Save you money.
3,Was ok,"This movie was an ok zombie flick, not the greatest ive see. But, then again, not the worest, either. Fair amonut of blood and gore. I just felt they could have done more with it."
3,Zombies on Prom Night!!!,"I thought this was pretty good. It wasn't really what I expected, but that's alright. For some reason, all the zombies come back on the night of the prom. Some of the nerds, and groups of people who didn't go to prom have to save the day and kill the zombies. Something I thought was too silly was when the zombies drove the car, and when the zombies listened to loud rock 'n roll music! If you like horror comedies, you might like DANCE OF THE DEAD!!!"
3,Story of a Key Figure of the Golden Age of Aviation,"This book is a relatively well written story of one of the key figures of the golden age of aviation, Roscoe Turner. Through flying in races, movies, record breaking flights and attempting to stay financially aloft, this is a good overview of a life. The only issue I had with this book was that it never truly conveyed the character of Mr. Turner and seemed more like a chronology than a true biography."
2,LONG and cheap...,"The bracelet arrived in a plastic bag (not the most impressive gift packaging), was 8 inches in length (which is HUGE when it comes to a girls wrist) and the construction is cheap. For $30? You get 2 stars."
4,Beautiful bracelet,"This dainty bracelet is a beauty. Sweet and delicate with a strong color to the peridots, it is very noticeable on the wrist. I especially like the double security latches. I am very, very pleased with my purchase."
2,"Yanni-Live at El Morro, Puerto Rico","This one is not so great. Instead buy ""Yanni Live - The Concert Event"" in Blu Ray. I give full 5 stars to that. It is stunning and I have watched it many times over with guests and friends and still love it."
2,Not what I expected,"Sadly last performances of Yanni are not as good as the others. The orchestra has beed reduced, great musicians like Pedro Stagnaro are not present, although voices are good."
1,Love Yanni,"One of the best prefomers out there, this concert was the best yet. Yanni always delivers a great musical experience."
1,Yanni: Live at El Morro Puerto Rico {Blu - ray ],"I did not know anything about [ Blu - ray ] , so I could not even watch it. Do you have it without the Blue-ray, so I canbuy it and be able to watch it???"
5,Very good,I have always liked Yanni's concert dvd's This one is just as good. Nice to see some of the newer songs played live
5,music for everyone,Yanni is simply a master not only as a musician but as a writer and a magnet for insanely talented musicians. His enthusiasm and soulfulness of his music is incredible. I really enjoy his concert DVD and would like to see a show should he come round my way.
5,The most amazing and uplifiting concert ever,"My kids don't like to watch cartoons, my kids love to watch and enjoy Yanni concerts instead. They actually love to play along with their imaginary instruments, they are 3, 5, and 11. Its amazing to see how my kids appreciation for good music has increased after discovering Yanni for the first time, and this concert at ""El Morro"" is the best ever in our Yanni DVD collection. So natural, so encouraging. Thank You Yanni for being such an example for our youth. My kid's dream though is to meet Yanni in person and play Felitsa with him, so they just starting learning violin."
3,"Get a Real Book, not a Movie Souvenir","Skillful rendering of the Disney animation by the same name with illustrations from the movie. I suppose this is a fine souvenir of the movie, but there are several lovely non-Disney versions of this famous tale out there, including many interesting ethnic versions. Save your money for those instead of a movie rehash."
4,Good for kids,"As advertised. I would recommend this for kids, which is what I bought it for. Kind of slim on the chips but otherwise great for their purposes."
3,"A ""fair-weather"" camera...","I bought the 8800 as a second camera to use when I didn't want to cart the DSLR and it's bag of lenses around. After using it for about two weeks, it's been returned.On the surface, it seems to have a lot of features, but I'd have to characterize the 8800 as a ""fair-weather"" camera. In sufficient light (e.g. daylight) it takes great pictures.Let the light get dim, however, or use it at it's extended zoom range, or indoors, and it just hunts, trying to find focus. Not being able to use the extended zoom in anything but the best lighting conditions make having one a bit pointless. The EVF is coarse, making it difficult to judge subject focus, and the camera's high ISO range (400) isn't really usable.For those trying to make the purchase decision, be aware, the camera has some major drawbacks. You'll definitely need to determine if it fits your needs and shooting style."
4,Check for RAW support with your Nikon Picture Project Program,"My Coolpix 8800 with the image stabilization and zoom is a real pleasure to use. I just wish somebody had pointed one thing out to me. When I finally got my computer upgraded to handle large files, and tried some camera raw files, the Nikon PictureProject reported the raw (.nef) file was un supported.When I went to the Nikon web site which listed an update to process raw files, it asked for my camera serial number. It then rejected the number with a message that I might have a camera that wasn't a Nikon US camera, and cancelled the download.I'm not sure how this could be avoided, but recommend that any purchaser of a Nikon camera register it immediately while they can send it back for a refund if it doesn't meet Nikon US requirements. I still like the Nikon cameras and lenses, but I will point out this problem to anyone asking how I like my camera."
1,Nikon Lens Error,"I was down in Antarctica when I turned on the camera and it said ""lens error"". After a day of missing some of the best pictures of Emperor Penguins with my 8800, I twisted the lens and got it to work. The same thing happened to me in Bolivia, just after the warranty expired. I called Nikon and they insist there is no problem with the camera. Do a Google search of ""lens error"" and Nikon 8800 and you will find lots of unhappy people with the same experience. This is my third and last Nikon."
2,Broken,"This camera has a built in zoom lens. If the lens breaks, you don't have a camera anymore. My lens is failing to zoom and now I have to buy a new camera although the rest of the camera works fine. It's money down the drain. Before the zoom malfunction, the camera took great pictures on a perfect day, but night time, indoor, and action pictures were almost always blurry even if you put it on the night time, indoor, or action settings. Also, the macro doesn't focus as close as I expected. That's something I should have known when I spec'd the camera though. I liked the swivel view finder."
1,Bad focus for a great camera.,The camera has really amazing features. But it also has an outrageously major focus weekness. I made a mistake of buying one.
1,Boring with a capital B,"I usually do not review books but felt it was necessary with this one. After reading the reviews (5 stars), I thought the book would be a page turner. I kept wondering when the action was going to start......."
4,Works like it's suppose to.,Nothing to write home about...its a hook. It works for what I need. The satin looks works well with my bathroom. Thats all.
3,cute rooster,"I loved the fitz & floyd art glass rooster. It arrived with a broken foot but, I will figure out how to repair it. so, it won't fall over anymore. It was too beautiful to send back."
1,False Advertising,"This chicken is not at all the size of the dimensions specified. It is actually about 3x3x1.5 inches and fits in the palm of your hand. I resent that the dimensions are wrong and if I had known, I would not have purchased the product."
3,Glass Rooster,"Product was smaller than I realized, but beautiful. This is a birthday present for my future daughter-in-law. In our family, it has always been said that it is good luck to have a rooster in your kitchen. I'm sure she will love this rooster, no matter what the size."
2,Philips AQ669117 Digital AM/FM Stereo,"When I received it ..I loved it! Until... I realized you could not rewind the tape!! I thought how absurd, this couldn't be..then I called the Philips `hotline' and they confirmed my apprehension. So I guess the theory `you get what you pay for' is really true."
1,Got a klunker,Quality definately missing in this machine. Radio stations that are clear on our other radios are static-laden on this player. Cassette sound also poor with a lot of hiss. Won't play cheaper tapes at all. Bought it as a gift and it was so embarrassing I ended up running out to Circuit City to grab a Sony replacement.
1,Knee strap,Item is not as described and lacks any effective support. Would not recommend for any knee condition.Seller has problems with returns and sent a used support. It did not arrive in its original container but rather in a plastic storage bag. Unhappy with product and seller. Would recommend to not order or use this supplier.
4,Cho Pat Dual Action,"I purchased this knee strap to alleviate my knee pain from ""runner's knee"" and I can't say how much it has helped!! The pain disappears once I put on the strap and go out running. I am training to run the Marine Corps Marathon this October and I can't do it without the use of my knee strap. My only complaint is that it tends to slip down my leg after a few miles due to sweat. I now use athletic tape along with the strap to prevent it slipping down my leg. I recommend this knee strap for anyone dealing with knee pain!"
5,good knee strrap,"I have used an Ace bandage on my weakest knee when it complains until it gets stronger but the Ace bandage in either size I have is too tight for comfort especially when I stop walking. I followed the instructions for measuring my knee and this one is much more comfortable and effective due to the tightness being where the knee is weakest and the center cut out. I like it very much. The company had a problem with timely shipping due to a 'glitch"" in that department. However, that was promptly addressed and I received the strap as promised on May 7."
5,Great Solution for my problems,"I have been playing tennis for the last 25 years once or twice a week ,, recently suffered from knee problems diagnosed as Patella Arthritis (which is knee cap pains) i have nearly stopped tennis for the last year ,,, i have tried a lot of knee supports & had the same pains during & after playing tennis ,, bought 2 of those straps for both knees & they work great ,, no pain & comfort .. im glad im back in action ... & would recommend it especially during practicing sports."
3,Knee strap okay,I bought this because I was having problems with my arthritic right knee. I used it while waiting for my MRI appointment with little positive effect on my pain. Found out that I have a torn meniscus.
1,Waste of money,This product offers lttle support. I was desparate for something to help my knee alignment and this did nothing. About as good as an ACE bandage.
4,"Nice support, very stable but bulky","Good support and stays on your leg where you put it. However, the straps are either padded ""for some reason"" or just very durable. Either way, the bulk is not necessary and gets in the way putting jeans on or taking them off. I ordered an XL because XL knee braces don't fit me, but in this case XL is too big for me. I'm 6' and weight 285#, most of it NOT muscle. That's not a complaint, just an observation in case you are ordering to know these run large... measure if you can."
4,"Good product, Timely delivery","Haven't had to use it much, recently. But it seems it will be helpful for my bad days! Thanks.Seller was good, no problems.I like that this is much more compact that some braces I have used. Easy to put on."
2,"Good for walking, not for moderate sports","Somewhat good support, but slides off during my basketball games. Waste of money for me. Too lazy to return. Might cost more but the McDavid knee support hinged brace would help with total support."
2,knee strap hurt,"Even tho' recommended by my doctor, I had more pain after strapping in this one, compared to the elastic one"
2,"Didn't work for me, maybe for someone else.","I purchased this item for running with my patellofemoral syndrome (kneecaps don't track correctly). I am an average to thin weight 5 foot 2 female in my 30s. I didn't find it to make any difference. I ended up seeing a doctor and a physical therapist and was taught to use Kiniseotape and do some strengthening exercises instead. Maybe this works for some but I didn't find it to make any difference. On the plus, it's not too expensive so might be worth a try before you spend more to see a doctor."
4,cho-pat,I'm very happy with my knee strap. It gives me the ability to walk or play golf without knee pain. I would recommend this item to others with similar problems.
2,Cho-PatDual Action Straps,"This is a nusence to use. It slips down and causes my slacks to ride up. I am never sure how tight to make it. Then if too tight is makes ""dents"" i my skin!!!II have stopped wearing it."
5,Great solution to knee pain.,"Have been running 40 years. Had a knee problem that put me out of commission for about a year. Started using the Cho_Pat and have no knee pain at all. Great product. Does the trick. Doug T. Scottsdale, AZ"
3,I thought it would apply more pressure to the lower tendons below the patella,Overall quality is good but was not that effective for me. Did not enough pressure/control for the tendon below my kneecap.
3,Helpful up to a point,"I have used the Cho-Pat during one full day of bicycling and felt that it provided useful support and lessened knee pain. I have used it on a recumbant exercise bike (for an hour each time) and found its support useful, I then tried it during skiing and felt that its support diminished over seven consecutive days of skiing (about 6 hours of very active skiing each day). I believe that a sturdier knee brace would have been a better choice for the skiing activity. Several years ago I had orthoscopic knee surgery and a fair amount of torn cartiledge was removed. I now have more bone on bone contact in the knee."
4,Ch Pat,The Ch-Pat Knee strap has worked as adverstized. I can exercise without knee pain. And there is no pain after I'm done either. Good product.
4,Excellent Support,This knee brace is terrific and gives me the support that I need above and below the knee. So far I have been pleased with this brace and it is described perfectly on the website. The sizing seems to run true and I would recommend this brace in addition to an under the knee strap brace. I think having different types of knee braces for different activities is important. The Cho Pat is fairly comfortable to walk in but you are aware of it being around your knee and it does restrict bending your knee a bit. If this fact bothers you then a simple under the knee strap is probably a better choice
5,Helps on the downhill part of a hike/backpack trip,"I am an avid hiker & backpacker, and so is my wife. Sadly, our knees are sometimes not as excited about exploring the great outdoors as we are, particularly on the downhill portions. There is something about hiking downhill, especially with pack weight that really aggravates our knees. Wearing the Cho-Pat, and using hiking poles, helps a great deal. I would recommend these to other hikers looking for some help with knee pain."
5,Very Pleased,I have a loose and painful knee joint resulting from years of running and martial arts practice. I was reaching the point where I almost could not run anymore due to this injury.I purchased this brace and ran comfortably the first day that it arrived. The brace has allowed me to keep running while the knee seems to be healing. This is a great product that I recommend without reservation. It does take a little time to get used to wearing it but it was not a significant issue for me.
3,Trying to decide between this and the Mueller one just like it,"I just put an average rating since this isn't a review, but I'm hoping to get responses from others who have maybe tried both the Mueller and this one and think one is better. I haven't boughten one yet but am going to. One thing that I notice about the Mueller is that is looks smaller and less cumbersome. I have used the single cho-pat but that's not enough so that's why I want to get one of these but hate the idea of having to wear something so bulky but if it works and I can run, then it's worth it:)."
2,Not impressed,It runs a little big and for the price I wasn't impressed with it. I should of went with a knee brace instead.
2,Only wore them for a few minutes and my knees were sweaty,"I just received these braces and since they are so thick the area that is covered by these braces receive no air whatsoever. After only wearing these for a few minutes I felt like I had to take them off to make my knees ""breath"". While wearing them I fail to understand how a simple wrap around your leg can really prevent knee pain. They also have a strong tire scent that I can still smell but I assume that will go away after you wash them a few times. I purchased two of these with shipping it came out to be $70, and that is not worth it."
5,Works great for me!,"When my knee starts acting up I put on this brace. Within 10 minutes of wearing it, the pain goes away. I think it really helps with alignment and support. It stays in place well too. I have been very pleased and consider it well worth the money."
2,Cho-Pat not too comfortable,"This knee brace is rather uncomfortable. When it is tight enough to stay in place during skiing or other activities, the edges dig in causing discomfort. It does a reasonable job of bracing the knee, however."
2,Awkward Product,I didn't find that the product provided a lot of support. It quickly becomes uncomfortable while working out due to the fact that it tends to slip when bending the knee.
5,keeps knee in place,my son has dislocated his knee three times and this seems to work very well keeping it in place. he likes it because it is endorsed by some famous cyclists
5,Knee Strap,We purchased this for a friend and it really feels comfortable to him and does the trick! Would buy another.
1,Can't wear under pants.,"I'm sorry to say I had to send this item back since it is too bulky to be worn under pants. Before I bought the product I did read another review that said this same thing, but I bought it anyway so I could see for myself. The other reviewer was correct."
4,"So far, so good","I play squash and I needed a little more support than an normal knee brace provides. I saw this advertized in Outside Magazine and decided to give it a try. So far, it is working to help my knee."
4,Great Knee Support,"At first, I didnt like it bc I put on wrong, but once I got it on properly, and went for a 7 mile jog with NO issues, I was sold!"
3,this Knee strap is just OK,"This only works (I guess) for a very mild knee problem. It just does not work for me. I have to go back to my Kneedit. I've been using that Kneedit for 2 years, and it's supporting my knee cap much better."
4,They work!,"I was experiencing knee pain and when I walked. I'm not overweight, but 5 miles daily was giving me aching knees, not shins. I tried other types, but they didn't work. These worked right away. The only complaint is that they're a little bulky - but... no pain."
4,Helps me workout,"I have been using this knee brace for some time now and it really seems to help. I try to stay active and a about a year ago I started having pain in my knee. The doctor said that I have Runner's Knee, odd since the only running I do is chasing the kids and playing softball. The doc suggested I get a strap that goes below my knee. I found this one and thought I would give it a try. I still have occasional pain when working out on my elliptical trainer or bike, but more often than not no pain. I have been very happy with this product"
2,Pressure Points in wrong place for my knee,I wanted to like this Knee Strap because of the great reviews. It did not work for me. The strap put too much pressure around my knee cap and the inside of my knee ached. The strap seemed too restrictive for my purposes.
1,Bad Product And Bad Customer Service,Very disappointing.The upper strap did not stay in place and slipped down even after just walking a few steps. I measured myself and did have the proper size. I tightened it as much as possible but nothing worked.BAD CUSTOMER SERVICE.........I was refunded only half what I paid and when the strap arrived it came with a very rude soundingreturn policy. I then read the feedback ratings at the Cho-Pat storefront on Amazon and wow they have one rude lady leaving very rude responses to the complaints made here on Amazon.I was going to order another product from them but they lost me as a customer forever.
2,WARNING!!! Incorrect sizing labels!,"My knee measures 13 inches, so a person would think this is the perfect size. WRONG! It was way too small.I followed the procedures for a return to Amazon.com and put the mailing label on a 7"" x 9"" mailing envelope. It weighed next to nothing. I was charged $5.19 for the return shipping PLUS the $.94 the seller originally paid to have it shipping to me. The $5.19 is an outrageous charge; $.94 is more like it.As I had to use the shipping label for the return, I had no choice in the matter. The shipping charges were 1/4 the cost of the knee strap. Quite a rip off! It makes me not want to order anything from Amazon.com unless I'm POSITIVE it will work.Little did I know that my 13"" knee was too big for a 12"" - 14"" strap!"
3,EASILY SLIPS DOWN,I LIKE THE BRACE BUT IT EASILY SLIPS DOWN NOT REALLY TRUE TO ITS XXL SIZE. NEEDED A LARGER SIZE
4,Cho Pat,Knee support works great. I've used the original Cho Pat knee brace previously and recommend it to anyone who wants a brace that will give you support and flexibilty. The dual action support gives you more support for athletic activities.
5,Best sports-related braces,"Purchased one a few years back, just picked up another for the other knee. By far, this brace is the best support for the patella while running, stopping, lateral movement, etc. I have used different braces while playing soccer, and none compare to the Cho-Pat line.Would highly recommend these."
5,Knee Fix,"I got back into running after talking to some of my neighbors and then trying a few races. Through the years, I have endured some minor knee injuries/issues. After stepping up my mileage, I began to have some knee pain. I did some research online and found the Cho-Pat. I then went to my local running store to see if they had one. They did not, but after all of the good reviews that I saw online, I decided to buy a couple at Amazon. They work well and I am pleased at how comfortable they are to run with. You might want to check with your doctor first, but if you are looking for a quick fix, this plus some strength training really helps.One final note, make sure you measure your knee accurately before buying. I was surprised that I was a medium. I'm a pretty big guy."
1,Don't bother,"Ordered 2 of these tables in December, they sent me Chestnut, not Walnut and one of them was broken and reglued. The second order; both Chestnut.Weeks later I found out they don't have this table in Walnut, only Chestnut and I had to call to find this out they never contacted me and attempted to fix this. Also I had to call a seperate number and argue for a refund on shipping for items I never received, now I expect 2 checks (I paid by credit card) sometime in the next 7 business days. We'll see if I get my money back in february."
4,"Great singing - but this is a CD-R, no notes!!!","Great singing here, particularly by Augér and Larmore. Seven (!) settings of Mi lagnerò tacendo in Musique Anodine. My principal objection to this disc is that it's a burned-CD-R and not a normally-produced CD. Far more annoying: no recording data, no texts, no notes in this re-issue. All this re-issue information should have been included in amazon's item description. Caveat emptor."
2,A Mere Peek at a Genius,"When I saw the word 'unauthorized' on the front of this book, I bought it thinking I would find out some real facts about this wonderful actor. Instead, I was spoon fed glossy peeks into what makes Keitel tick, most of which I could have looked up myself. I believe this author was too scared to write the truth. Who can blame him? This book is nothing more than a big disappointment. I never even found out why Copolla really kicked Keitel out of the Phillipines. That alone would have been worth the price of the book."
4,My Favorite Everyday Knife,"Some nicer scales are all I'd wish for to give this knife a full five stars. The shiny, hard plastic ones it has are too smooth and slippery if your hands are a little greasy or slimy.This three blade combination has always been my favorite configuration, so I was excited to see it offered by a reputable manufacturer like Klein. The slot-screwdriver blade is rigid enough to pry the lid off a paint can without bending or twist when applying a reasonable amount of torque to it...like the no-name brand examples I have had have usually done. The carbon steel blades are just the right hardness to sharpen easily yet hold an edge. I bought one of these knives about six years ago, and bought the one I have now about a year later after dropping the first one in the drink. I carry mine every day and hope Klein keeps making them forever."
5,long experience,"I rebuild old houses. 35 years ago, I bought 2 of these. One got crushed (I forget how), plastic jacket broke and pin at one end came loose. The other I still have. One or the other has been in pocket of my work pants since I bought them. It is built to last. For me, this is a must have tool. If I misplace it, I look for it until I find it."
5,good knife.,"My other electrician's knife was lost. This is a great replacement. The blades are very sharp. The screwdriver blade is stiff, but it does open with a little effort. Hopefully it will loosen up with time (since I use that blade almost every day)."
5,Finding Family DVD,Outstanding family movie that made you thankful of your own life and just how fortunate you really were. I think this is one that everyone should purchase.
5,Great movie,This movie is wonderful because it tells a story of a boy who doesn't quit for anything to get a good education.
1,pass this one by (no pun intended),Dry. Boring. Had to re-read sentences to understand them. Just not a pleasant read. I ended up donating it after a few chapters.
5,good band,"having listened to the agression album a lot,i always thought the best tracks they ever recorded were on the B.Y.O. sampler all those years ago.dear john letter is one of my fave tracks of all time..."
3,Works well until it breaks down,"This machine is very effective for treating colds and allergies. Several times I have had the spooky experience of washing a cold entirely away.However, as another reviewer pointed out, it is cheaply made. Ours lost power and stopped working after less than 2 years of occasional use.The problem was apparently the lubrication. I removed the black, gritty grease from the reciprocating part of the mechanism and put in clean synthetic grease. That apparently fixed the problem."
3,Great Product -but doesn't last more than a year,"A sinus irrigator is a great product for folks like me who suffer from faulty sinus plumbing or chronic sinus infections.It's loud but you get used to it because it works.I've tried a few different brands of these products and they all work about the same.The work well for about 10-11 months and then they die.So you have to spend about $100 on one of these at least once a year - or at a cost of about $2/week.Mind you, I have followed the cleaning/maintenance instructions to the letter.I have gone through 2 grossan sinus irrigators - both have leaked from the bottom, and died within a year.All in all, I've gone through about 10 sinus irrigators over the past 10 years. I just wish they were better quality."
1,"Great idea, cheap piece of junk","Thr Grossan Irrigator is great. It does just what it says--it helps relieve sinus congestion issues. I actually love it.When it works.As others have said, this this is the cheapest piece of junk I've purchased. My original one didn't seem so bad--it lasted two years before the motor seized up and stopped working. So I got a new one. It started leaking all over the place just a few months into using it, and then its motor stopped working as well.It really is a shame--with just a little bit of thought and care into the manufacture of this device it could be fantastic. But instead they clearly decided to cost-cut as drastically as possible, and you are left with a pile of junk that is guaranteed to break down on you sooner rather than later. What a shame."
2,Dreary,This author seems to develop darkness. The reading of the book was laborious and the ending is apparently typical of his other novels. I should have checked out the themes of his other books.
2,Server + Exam Cram not up to Coriolis Standards,"The Server + Exam Cram covers most of the subject matter in the Comptia Server+ Exam. However much of the material is descriptive rather than hard information expected from a ""brain dump"" tome. There is no excuse for the many typographical errors throughout the book, as well as incorrect answers to practice questions. One of the answers listed Amps as a unit of Amplitude, rather than Current flow, showing that the Authors had no concept of basic electricity! Many of the Comptia exam questions are now real world situations with more than one correct answer, which this book covers superficially. This Exam Cram book needs to be revised and brought up to the Coreolis standard of hard facts, accurate information, and practice questions simulating the actual Server+ test."
2,Disappointing,"While the few other Coriolis Exam Cram books I have used have been of good to excellent quality, I discovered when only a few questions into the Server+ exam that this particular book was almost completely useless. I did pass the exam, but with little help from this book. There are numerous typos (is that GB or MB?), inconsistencies, and straight-out errors. The actual content is barely relevant to the onslaught of experience-based troubleshooting questions on the exam. I gave this two stars instead of one because I do recall a couple questions (out of an eighty question exam) where my studying in the book actually did help me. I hate to give a Coriolis book a bad rating, seeing as how they've always released quality products in the past, but this book is just terrible in comparison."
2,Skip this Server+ resource,"This book brings nothing to the table except for more review questions for a Server+ candidate to dutifully go through. Even then, some of the questions and answers are mismatched. The information presented are wrought with spelling errors and can only imagine that the editor(s) were busy doing something else. The SCSI, RAID and backup chapters did not have enough information in my opinion which is a no-no considering the emphasis the exam puts on these topics. However, this book is a quick read and is best used a week before the actual exam date much like the Passport series, but I think you'd do better elsewhere."
2,Exam Cram Server+ Full of errors but cheap,I bought this book as a second source for studying for my Server+ exam mainly because it was cheap on the Amazon used market (50 cents). This book has served that purpose well but I'd be reluctant in recommending it as a primary source for study as it has many distracting errors; many of which could lead the reader to answering test questions incorrectly. I could recommend this as a secondary reference for the well experienced reader who would not be lead astray by the errors. The poor proof reading of this volume is evidence to the reason for the disappearance of Coriolis publishing shortly after this book was printed.
1,Not helpful to pass the test,"This book doesn't cover a lot of things one needs to know the Server+ test. It's definitely not up to the usual Exam Cram standards. The chapters are lacking facts and information, structure, and are quite frankly boring to read (yes, some technical books are quite entertaining or informative...;)"
2,You expect me to pass the exam with this?,I give you 2 stars for effort. This book didn't not have any relevant information in it about the Server+ exam.It did cover the basics of the topics but it did not include any useful tips or proper practice questions relating to the exam. It did not go into detail on what to expect on the real exam or did it cover the objectives fully. I was very disappointed in this book and was surprised it was so thin for a study guide. Do not use this as your only source for the exam. You will need more then what is presented in this book
2,Not the Best,"Admittedly, I've only read the first couple of stories, but they weren't all that interesting or humorous. Maybe I'm just not the right audience for it (I'm 20, and need real adventure and excitement). I wasn't able to continue on with reading any other stories."
5,GREAT INFORMATION!,A super documentary with tons and tons of information on homeopathic medicine. I work in the natural medicine field but have always had some questions surrounding homeopathic medicine. This documentary answered those and more
3,back rest review,"it's okay, but doesn't fit on most chairs and slips so becomes more of a nuisance. better to just buy a high back chair to give support where needed."
2,"Not for neck support. Buy for lumbar, maybe.","Bought this for lumbar and neck support due to disease. Lumbar is merely passing. And there is NOT ANY neck support. There is a gap between me and the back support that would need to be filled to provide support. The lumbar is attached by velcro. This product needs an additional piece to velcro for neck support to fill that gap. Buy a lumbar pillow and neck pillow -- cheaper on you. I still have to add three pillows to make this work because the design is lacking. Probably returning after being delivered just today. None of the previous reviews stated the lack of neck support requiring to add pillows or something to adjust for the poor design. I think it would be okay if you already have a really good chair that fits you like a glove. And then, what's the point of having to buy this?"
