1,"Yet another overrated, boring movie","""Lost in Translation"" is another one of those boring movies that gets praised by film critics who think it is very deep and meaningful. It reminded me a lot of Stanley Kubrick's films ""2001"" and ""The Shining"". All three of these films are beautiful to look at, but they are otherwise empty in content. About an hour into this movie, I found a book to read. Nothing interesting or exciting happened during the whole movie. It just seemed to be ""there"" and did not have a real story to it. What I saw in this movie was a middle-aged man who was bored and lonely. This movie really made me miss the Bill Murray that I loved in ""Ghostbusters"". The wit, fun, and cynicism that he showed in ""Ghostbusters"" was gone in ""Lost in Translation"". It made me feel sad."
1,Would anyone care if they carbonized this one?,Hundreds of thousands of people gather around in huge circules to watch as millions of VHS and DVD copies of this movie are burnt into piles of carbon.
1,This movie is boring.,I saw many good reviews of this movie and I trusted them when I decided to watch this movie. I was wrong. This movie was very boring. The story is slow. Camera work is awful. Music sucks. The ending is cheesy. It reminded me many things about Japan but that's it. It's not really funny. It's not really a love story. It's not really anything. This movie is boring for regular folks like me.
5,"""An Amazing Film""","The Coppola saga hasn't ended yet. Sofia Coppola is a genius, she's not as aggressive as her father, she's swewet, she's gentle, and mostly about business. Sofia Coppola's best film was ""The Virgin Suicides"", which was overlooked.The way I heard about ""Lost In Translation"" was my favorite critic Roger Ebert who quoted: This is Bill Murray's best dramatic performance. I said ""Bill Murray doing a drama, well I'm pretty shocked."" Murray has never done a great dramatic performance until now, he made me cry, he made me laugh, and made me cry some more. This is agreat film, and I can write a sonnet about Scarlet Johanssen. I love this film."
1,What about a story?,"This excruciatingly slow and dull film would have been enhanced if it had a decent screenplay. (To show you how far out Hollywood is, this movie won an Oscar for Best Original Screenplay.) The plot takes forever to emerge, and then it isn't worth the wait. Deadpan Bill Murray, flirting with a girl half his age, seems to adlib many of his lines. After, say, an hour, the incredible shallowness of all concerned becomes overwhelming.Both of the leads complain of insomnia. They could have been cured by watching this film."
2,Worth the Buzz?,"I felt bored watching this. I am not sure what all the buzz was about. I love Bill Murray, completely enjoyed the Life Aquatic, but this flick didn't do it for me. Scarlett Johannsen seemed flat, not restrained as another reviewer stated."
5,Everybody who gave this a 1 out of 5 are so wrong.,"Firt of all this movie is more of a suddle comedy and not a lugh out loud comedy, and that's what I like so much about it. And aside from the comedy, the acting is the best I've ever seen! Bill Murray is at the top of his game in this film. Another thing I like about it is the wacky romance between Bill Murray and Scarlett Johansson.Overal, if youre somebody whose favorite movie is something like Scary Movie, chances are your'e not going to like it."
4,If you've ever been abroad...,"Those who have ever spent some time abroad, and not just for a few days on vacation, will recognize themselves in the lives of Bob (Bill Murray) and Charlotte (Scarlett Johansson).The differences in culture overwhelm you at first, as they did Bob, and you're so tired from jet lag and the time change you barely notice your surroundings. After awhile, you might begin to feel as Charlotte does, isolated and lonely without any family or friends, an outsider observing another way of life.You begin to gravitate towards any other Americans that you encounter, which is what Bob and Charlotte find themselves doing."
2,"ok movie, not great and definitely not Oscar worthy!","This movie is nowhere near as good as all the hype that surrounded it. The story is weak, and the chemistry between Murray and Johansson was a dry, boring snooze fest. What am I missing here? The plot is something my four year old niece could of created. A girl, whose boyfriend ignores her while in Japan, falls (sort of) for an older guy (not likely, unless of course it is the real ""Bill Murray"" and not his character). They be-friend each other and go around to different parties and places hanging out just to keep each other company. The visuals are pretty good and I liked watching all the beautiful sights and hearing the sounds of Japan street life, but it was not enough to carry the whole movie. I found it rather boring, and was surprised considering I like realistic movies that do not rely on special effects and cheesy one liners. Unfortunately this movie failed to peak any real interest out of me. Rent it and decide for yourself."
1,Easily one of the worst movies I've ever seen.,"This is one of two movies I will site as creating a desire to have my time wasted watching the film returned to me. I don't care how, time machine, karmic reversals, spatial anomaly... I'm not picky. But this is a horrible viewing experience. It's decently acted but the story is, well, an ass sandwich."
1,Should have won a razzie,To err is human. I will be orderinfg chinese food tonight..any suggestions?
1,One of the all time WORST movies ever made,"This movie is one of the worst that I've ever seen and my dead grandmother could have done a better job than Bill Murray ...When the credits rolled at the end of the movie, I had two conflicting thoughts ... First ... hey wait, the story hasn'teven started yet ... what's the story??? and 2. THANK GOD IT'S OVER !!!! Only intellectual snobs who are totally clueless but feel they have to be PC will say that they honestly like thismovie ..."
1,Lost in watching this worthless piece of ....,"If you've had trouble falling asleep, this is the film for you. I hav'nt seen a film with this much action since Andy Worhals Empire State Building. I've worked in Tokyo under similar circumstances and had an exciting and eventfilled experience. These principle characters come off as a couple of dull folks from the USA. Why all the fuss about this film? Somebodies pockets must be getting lined. And I'm a big Bill Murry fan. I'd rate this film 0 stars and 5 ZZZZZs."
2,Lame,"Oscar? People actually think this deserves an OSCAR??????? I admit, there are some fun moments in this movie, but for the most part i found it boring. I also happen to like movies that make you think (Lost Highway, Mulholland Drive), and this is just boring straight through. The acting is decent, but the plot falls short of capturing the attention of the audience. Interesting to see once, but never again."
1,So Boring I couldn't watch 50% of the Movie,"Watch out for this one folks! I didn't think that I could ever NOT like a Bill Murray movie. I think Mr. Murray may have been nominated for an Oscar because he is totally ""out of character"" and ""unfunny"". Let's hope we never have to see the serious side of Bill Murray again. Scarlett Johansson was beautiful and did a better acting job in ""Girl with the Pearl Earring"". Now we know why movies with NO plot don't work!"
2,Overblown,"An okay movie but as most of the reviews state, very oversold. If it wasnt made by a Coppola it'd be just another film."
1,Ignorant!,"I rented this movie thinking it was going to be funny and entertaining... How can a movie like this be nominated for an Oscar? It is terribly slow and the dialogues are far from intelligent. It could have been a very interesting introduction/discovery of the Asian culture. I found it stupid and a permanent demonstration that the american culture is superior to the local one (usually the attitude that ignorant people assume when they visit a foreign country!). I would have given it -5 stars if that option was available!Sofia Coppola... pfff!!! If her name was Sofia Smith she would still be selling popcorn at the theater, not sitting at the Academy Awards ceremony."
1,Much Ado About Nothing,"This film is about nothing. There is no intellect. There is no inspiration. It goes nowhere, and starts nowhere. Instead, it uses the Japanese people and their culture as comedic devices. Unfortunately, it was disrespectful, insulting, and racist. This movie isn't even worth a one-star rating. It's definitely on my worst list. I wouldn't even wish this movie upon my worst enemy. Yes, it was just that bad.It's unfortunate when people have to put other cultures down in order to feel good about themselves. Sofia said she wanted to make a movie in Japan, but she should have left this one on the cutting-room floor. The entire movie is ""Lost in Translation."" Can someone explain to me the purpose in making a movie with no plot, empty characters, and meaningless dialog??? You can't, because it would be a fruitless exercise.Hollywood likes boring, derogatory crap with big names attached to it, and this is all the proof you will need."
2,At least it looked cool,"Getting a better view of Tokyo was cool, but I think the movie would have benefitted if it had an actual plot, other than Scarlett and Bill having a sulking contest, moping around Tokyo. My summary - he's bored, she's bored, they're slightly less bored together, and slightly less bored than the audience."
3,didn't love it OR hate it,"As much as I want to beleive I haven't matured since high school, watching and understanding what this film is saying has slapped me with a slight realization, that maybe I've grown up (a little) I only am prompted to write this, in response to some of the long winded and negetive reviews. Be thankful you didn't get it, as that means you still havn't experienced many of the disapointments that await you in life. Bill Murray is a very successful actor, the dream acomplishment of thousands, yet his life really sucks. Taken for granted by his family, bored out of his mind in a luxury hotel.Treated like an idiot by some idiot director of a liquor ad. The list goes on and on about why his life sucks, and maybe ours isn't all that bad. That's what I got out of it. And I also got a great laugh from the ""lick my stockings"" scene."
4,i can totally relate,those that have spent any amount of time in asia (like i did) will definitely relate to this movie...
3,"Love the movie, hate the DVD","I only give this DVD 3 stars because the DVD presentation is fairly bad. The Focus Features advertisement at the beginning has to be fast forwarded through. I couldn't switch audio presentations during the film; Dolby had a light crackle in the right rear speaker (maybe just my system, but DTS didn't have it). When I did switch to DTS I couldn't resume the movie where I left off, I had to use the scene selection to get back to where I was. The list goes on. Extras are nice but the only thing I would have liked would be a commentary track by the stars and/or the director. I thought this movie was out kind of soon on DVD, and now I see that they may have rushed things. I have rarely been this disappointed in the DVD presentation of a movie I've liked so much. Collectors may want to wait for a better presentation.The movie is excellent. Issues aside, once you hit play it's about the film."
2,Nothingness,"1. It's not a bad movie. If it were not for the hype, there maybe fewer people who hate it. Quite some people would find it interesting/different - a little off the Hollywood mainstream.2. Being different does not necessarily mean being great... We are all so often and so easily confused by the two, admitted or not.3. People get tired of Hollywood mainstream - the usually show-off stuff (action, plot driven, nudity, dramatization, etc); when we come across something that lack all of it, more or less nothingness... then we tend to believe there must be something special... We can believe or imagine somethingness from nothingness which dress itself in the artsy clothes at the most...4. It's nice to have family in show business. There are so many independent films there which are equally and fairly interesting, different, or maybe more so if given the similar resource as in this one. However, never has such an ordinary movie received such extraordinary acclaims"
2,Possibilities Squandered,"I saw this when i first came out.There was so much that could have been done comedically with the premise of this,without stooping to lowbrow slapstick (though that has it's place too). The same story could have been told in America. I thought the setting of Tokyo was,with a couple of exceptions,wasted.I found it very difficult to get to the ending,,and I'm perfectly capable of getting through a movie where stuff doesn't get ""blowed up real good"" every two minutes.But,i've always been one to make myself sit through a movie, and I'm still glad I sat through it, because my prediction of ""we're going to see a lot more of Scarlet Johansen"" appears to be coming true."
1,I hated it,but then I found out it was a spoof to fool all the wannabe intellectuals. They have identified themselves here with their 5 star reviews.
1,Great for Insomniacs,"I cannot understand the glowing reviews of this exceedingly boring film. I fell asleep on the three separate occasions I tried to see the movie all the way through.I do not know anyone who liked it, not even a little.Why is the Industry slobbering all over Sophia Coppola? Except for some brilliant photography, the film is amateurish, plotless, and really dumb.Bill Murray's so-called ""performance"" is so bland and dull, it's difficult to remember how good he can be.If Murray wins the Oscar for this movie, it will be solely due to the fact that he is much loved by everyone in the business.If Ms Coppola wins, it will be because it's the only way to keep her behind the camera instead of in front of it."
1,snore,"if you like movies that go absolutely nowhere and have zero character development and have scenes that always seem to go on about 5 minutes too long then you'll love this one! the humor always seemed to play out like an inside joke that i just wasn't in on...it's just not a funny film, it tries very hard to be one, but it isn't...and it's a shame b/c bill murray and scarlett johannson are terrific actors and they are wasted on a pointless and tired script....i really have no idea why critics and people alike are just raving about this one, i walked out of the theatre about 3/4 through the film, one of the best decisions i've ever made..."
4,Thought provoking,There is alot more to this movie than meets the eye. I've never written a review before but this movie was good enough to make me stop and tell you to buy it. Bill Murray's performance is unbelievable.
1,If I could give this zero stars...,"I have to admit that I'm not a Bill Murray fan, but how this movie could get 5 stars frome anyone is a mystery. It is plotless, houmorless, and an overall waste of time and money. Can people ""pump"" a movie online just to get sales up? Every movie I've seen Murray in was better than this one."
1,No Point,"If any movie demonstrates the corruption of the ""system"" it is this childish movie that has no discernable value... I can not believe that this monster made by anyone other than FF Coppola's daughter would habve made it to any theater. Horrible and embarrassing."
3,Again with the dreaming older men.,"First of all I actually did like this film, the charecters were interesting and Charlotte was so somber and sexy.BUT>>>>Who told Bill Murray that he is sexy???Why would she,Charlotte be attracted to him ? I guess the obvious being he was the only American around.Why no implication of a love making scene. The movie gives the viewer the impression that Charlotte was all for it but it was Bob Harris that abstained... Yeah right. A young girl crushes on an older,much older, guy and he is a complete gentleman. Sorry not believable."
5,The most boring movie I saw this year...,"...was without a doubt ""Matrix Reloaded"" and particularly the fight with the white haired guys which went on FOREVER and got absolutely nowhere. I really felt I'd wasted that two hours of my life (and I was dumb enough to waste even more on ""Matrix Revolution"" just in case they could pull it all together - they didn't.)I point this out because some seem to think that superficial speed counts for more than believable content or characters drawn with any degree of emotion or intelligence.As for ""Lost in Translation"" Slow? Perhaps. Because it needs to be. I'd say evenly paced.Plenty of plot for those with the brain to see it. Wonderful performances. Great cinematography. Assured writing and directing from Sofia Coppola, who knows exactly what the story needs to be told well."
3,Middle-aged American male suddenly intriguing in Toyko?,"Bill Murray maintains our (middle-aged American male) interest only by looking poised to mug for the camera; why 23-ish Scarlett would be attracted is puzzling. Murray as an ex-action hero is also problematic. Bruce Willis would have been perfect: there's even a guest shot on Japanese TV that matches his scene on the cruise liner with Chris Tucker. In the making-of documentary Sofia says she only considered Murray, so draw your own conclusions.The film's sight and sound suggest sinus-related hearing loss as much as the jet lag and insomnia oft-mentioned. But the filmmakers say they suffered this symptoms as well, so one must yield to cinema verite.Although Murray's bed scene describing his life and family is a stunner, follow his character's lead by watching ""La Dolce Vita."" Marcello is matchless, and the interview with Sofia Coppola and Murray was filmed in Rome, but what is Coppola's point?"
1,HORRIBLE MOVIE,"I managed to watch about 9/10 of the movie before I had to turn it off because I was so bored. I kept hoping that it would get better, but it didn't. There wasn't even really a plot line!"
3,Average movie for a very good comedian,"Although I am fond of his comedy since Ghostbusters and even before that, this movie is below average on comedy and not for the family to enjoy.It could be compared to several of Kubriks movies, including Doctor Strangelove, for its bizar content and focus, but if your looking for a nice evening of comedy and enjoyment, this is probably not for you."
2,Lost In Translation DVD,"I didn't particularlly care for this movie, it was just too slow with little or no plot of interest. But that's only my opinion, someone may find it more appealing than I did."
1,Have never seen this film,I have never seen this film so I am totally unqualified to give a review. But becuase I took the time to write this I would appreciate some folks indicating this review was helpful to them. Peace out.
1,Too Boaring for Words,Unfortunately for me I went by the cover and actor when picking out what I thought would be a good movie.If anyone reads this and can tell me what they see in the first 45 minutes that was worth any thing to spend there time watching. Please give this review a rebuttal. This movie to me is too Boaring for Words!Toney BurkhartSan Francisco
2,Lost in Transcraplation,"Wow. After reading all of the rave reviews by the critics and the accolades of others who had seen this movie, I though that I was in for a real treat. This was not so, however, and I found myself tired and bored out of my mind. I guess I just can't connect to the humor in this movie about being stuck in a different country, but to relate one would have to first find the humor. I don't suggest buying this if you haven't seen it already."
1,Lost in Translation is a Looser,"""Lost In Translation"" is a looser. Bill Murray is his typical dead-pan dull self projecting the same persona he has perfected in all his other films from his ""Stripes"" and ""Ghost Busters"" days. He is a straight man in search of a side kick to breath life into his act. He has not found one to date.The story is about a man out of his culture. Bill Murray plays the American buffoon stumbling into and around in a land (Japan) totally alien to him. Do you want an in-depth analysis of the story line? I just gave it to you. This film is not that deep.If you are a Bill Murray groupie you will love this film. If you are a Bill Murray groupie you need to get out to other films. Rent some films with Ben Kingsley in them if you want to see a versatile actor. Broaden your horizons.I am always in search of something good to say about a movie...ah, a colleague lent me this DVD so I didn't pay a cent. There you have it, a positive aspect of ""Lost In Translation."""
1,Lost In Translation? I'd prefer just lost...,"My goodness, if ever a movie had been so boring in my childhood, I may never have watched another movie again!! Don't get me wrong, I LOVE Bill Murray and Scarlett Johnansen certainly has what it takes as a newcomer but this movie bases it success entirely on the name COPPOLA...I can't tell you what this movie is about. I don't know. I don't care... My Mother and I get together once a week and watch movies. Old movie, new movies, color movies, black-and-white movies, silent movies, and we could not wait for the release of this. So finally, it came out and we watched it... and watched it... and watched it... and waited for something to happen. It never did.This is not even one of those movies you can say, ""Hmmm. Didn't like it the first time, maybe I'll watch it again and I'll like it."" Absolutely not. That opportunity will never come. I will not watch this again. Sorry, Sofia, but you should give those awards back for this one."
1,And they call US the stupid ones....,"Here's a tip for all you 5-star ballot stuffers like Yoshi Gaiden: If you are going to engage in ballot stuffing, then it might be a good idea to change your name and location on each vote. Oh, and maybe wait more than a second or two after your first vote before you submit the next one. Yeesh...Anyway, this movie stunk, even for something that was supposed to be a quirky, subtle, slow character study, in the indie-film vein. Forget trying to pick up on the ""subtleties"" of it, because there are none worth picking up on. It's just a whole lot of mostly nothing. Good for insomniacs, though."
1,DON'T BUY THIS MOVIE!!!,"This is one of the worst movies to ever end up on film. Don't waste your money. Wait until it comes on DirecTV, Cable, HBO, or Showtime. Rent it at Blockbuster Video. This is not a five-star movie. Don't be fooled by the hype that is being generated to empty your pocketbooks. She won an Oscar because she had a famous last name. Without it, this movie never would have left the port. This was a racist flop of epic proportions. Please don't judge good movies according to the standards this trashy movie has set forth."
1,"There was no ""Zero Star"" Rating","Sophia has proven herself as dismal a writer as she was an actress (and who can forget her abysmal performance in ""Godfather 3""?)It is an outrage that she was nominated for best director, particularly since Barbra Streisand had been ignored for ""Prince of Tides"".Bill Murray did an excellent job in what was basically a mocumentary of Tokyo night life.Our family tried to watch this thing on three separate occasions, hoping to find what critics saw. Eventually, we gave up."
1,lost in translation,"Not much to say, it was a terrible movie,. I waited and waited for something to happen. Like Bill Murrey had a stupid look on his face the whole movie, which might of meant, you dummy, you paid over 7 bucks to view this crap???? I think it made the Japanese look like nitwits."
1,One of the worst I have seen,"I desperately wanted to like this movie; The rave reviews, the awards, and Bill Murray were all so enticing. I tried. I truly did. But it was so boring. It lulled me into a stupor and I can't even recall how it ended.If it were possible, I would give this zero stars. I graduated from film school but I""m not snooty. I enjoy almost anything; all I ask is that it hold my interest. This most definitely did not.There are very few movies I truly detest for boring me to tears. In fact, the only other one I can think of right now is ""The Bridges of Madison County""."
1,'LOST' CURE FOR INSOMNIA,"Waste of time, one of those movies where you keep watching, telling yourself ""10 more minutes, I'll turn it off it doesn't start to get good"". And you don't listen, and you keep watching, and you dozzzzzzzzzzzzze off knowing you are not missing anything substantive. And those who agonizingly stayed awake, through vigorous caffeine stimulation, tell you upon your awakening that it never got better. It stayed bad. Very bad, very low budget. Like $50. budget. Like ""Thin Red Line"", well, not that bad, but close! And you awake, knowing you were the wiser for getting some rest instead of wasting time on this flick!"
2,The movie is fine if you like...,"...slow movies without an identifiable soundtrack....movies about romances between old men and young women.If you don't (and you're like me), then don't bother watching this movie! The movie started out okay, but just went downhill and slowed down as the movie progressed."
1,"wow, I am quite sure",that this TV season will be very good. Look for new episodes of law and order. Does anyone know when the Sopranos begin?
1,What a yawn-fest,"Maybe I didn't get it, but this movie was really a disappointment. All the hype and I was left wondering why??? Skip it..."
2,This just didn't do it for me,"Take a good camera and cinematographer anywhere in Tokyo, and you're bound to get some striking imagery. It's a beautiful, clean, lively place. That's about all you get here, though. Director Sophia Coppola has created a bourgeois tale about lonely superstars, millionaires and dilletantes in Japan that seethes with poor-pity-me melodrama and American xenophobia (witness the endless 'L' for 'R' gags, or the the gush of verbage quickly summarized by a translator at the photo shoots). 'Lost In Translation' had a remarkable opportunity to build bridges with modern day Japan and blew them to maintain this idiotic sensibility. Aside from cinematography, the film does two things right: the soundtrack is packed with great music selections, and Anna Farris' character Kelly virtually defines the modern young Hollywood actress, with inane banter about body cleansing and the low-carb Japanese diet."
2,Eh!,"The movie played more like a documentary. I can't believe they actually had lines to memorize for this. It would have been a quite decent documentary if it were one. As it is, Bill Murray the actor seems to be bored and on auto-pilot as the movie drags on. He's wry - which is usually good for him, but I found myself just waiting for the film to finish ... then when it did, I couldn't believe that was all there was to it.The title of the movie is just a ploy to use a cliché to sell it, and it worked as far as marketing goes. But it has nothing to do with its contents at all and is very misleading. There was no attempt by the American characters to understand anything Japanese, and between the Americans there was nothing to misunderstand. I am at a total loss as to why Bill Murray or the movie was nominated for an Academy Award. I didn't hate it, I just didn't like it."
1,A bore to sit through,"Not for people who like movies with plots. Basically, Lost in Translation follows two Americans who are in Japan on business. Both have their problems (one has a workaholic husband and doesn't know what to do with her life, the other is an actor but feels stuck doing commercials, both have failing marriages), but they are not the highlight. Neither do anything to fix their problems, but they lean on each for support. Meaning, they go to karaoke bars and arcades and drink. There is absolutely nothing meaningful about Lost in Translation.While the back of the DVD case says an unexpected friendship blooms, their relationship is more like that of two people who don't know what they want. Ex. They act as if they want to help each other with their marriage issues, but then wind up sharing a passionate kiss before the guy (I forget his name.. It was really that boring) has to leave for the States. If some development of the romance had occurred, it might have made more sense."
1,For What It's Worth ...,"This is my first, and hopefully last, movie review ever, and it's written as more of a warning than anything else. I feel it my civic duty to plead anyone considering spending the time to watch this movie (let alone rent or buy it) to just walk away. I don't want you to be fooled as I was by good reviews and Bill Murray's name.I won't waste any more of your or my time on thoughtful insight here, except to say that this movie defies my worst expectations. With the possible exception of interesting scenery and atmosphere, it lacks anything remotely entertaining ... enlightenment, humor, emotion, acting, etc., etc. Sorry to be such a downer, but this movie is so useless I couldn't fall asleep watching it.Again, this is just a warning for what it's worth: this movie just isn't worth it."
2,Lost on me,"I saw this movie because *everyone* was talking about it. I was expecting a comedy, like everyone says it is, and I went away feeling stupid. It made me feel like its movie more geared towards the upper class.I felt stupid. I honestly think this is a movie not everyone can apprieciate. It makes me sad, because its not often I don't like a movie and I wanted desperately to like this movie. Maybe I was trying too hard to like it.Overall, it plays like Elephant long scenes, hardly any dialogue, and detailed character protrayal. Except, I just was bored with this. There, similarly to Elephant, is simply no plot. However, that was intended on that film, and it just doesn't make sense with this one. At least not for me."
3,"Movie is great, but this DVD is terrible","I was so excited to get this DVD in the mail only to realize that when you put the DVD in your player, you cannot skip chapter, stop, go to the menu. You are forced to watch the previews. I'm the viewer and the CUSTOMER here, don't insult me like this. I want to be able to control how and what I view. Terrible, terrible DVD."
2,averaged&uneven,"i finally saw this film after all the hype it's gotten.I've always fug Bill Murray&was glad he was finally getting some Props.but anyway this film goes all over the place without making a single statement&becomes one long film that I spent a good hour wondering how it got all the hype it recieved? it has some cool moments,but it doesn't merit all the hype."
2,I just didn't get it.,"The rating is more like 2.5 stars, but who's counting. The main reason I didn't get or like this movie is because I've never been to Japan. I can't feel for the characters because I don't know the culture, which I get that they don't either, but it still just didn't work for me."
1,Overated,will not recommend. Husband and I fell asleep twice watching. don't get the whole Oscar buss. still love Bill Murray!
4,A Little Over-rated But Still Very Nice,"I don't share the conventional wisdom that this is some kind of masterpiece, but it's a good film. It's slow in spots but Bill Murray is inspired and Scarlett Johansson is touching, and the last 30 minutes are genuinely poignant. I think the reason this film has been so praised is because it is so different from most commercial Hollywood movies out there. But I remember the movies from approximately 1967 to 1981, and believe me, this is what they used to be like before Spielberg and George Lucas infantilized them and dumbed them down. Characters and stories were allowed to be complex and adult, like a good short story (like this film.) People saw the name ""Coppola"" on this film and got nostalgic for a time when movies still mattered to grown-ups. This movie isn't in the same league as ""The Godfather."" But's it's definitely in the same honorable tradition."
5,looooved it!,"OOH to be in Sophia Coppola's shoes...to have an idea that is like poetry...to tell a story without sex or things blowing up!I loved this movie.Bill Murray and Scarlett Johansson meet at the right place and time. They give one another something that the other needs. They communicate when the rest of the world appears to be concerned with superficial stuff like carpet squares and diets.""Lost in Translation"" does not mean ""Oh too bad they cannot speak the language!"" It means...that many of us are not listening anyhow, even in the same language.Bill and Scarlett are 30 years apart, but are both filling a void in one another, they are listening to one another.The sexiest scene is when her toe touches his toe!Ohhhh yea, baby!Finally, a movie where two minds meet, love, even converse without talking at times. The sexual tension is there...(We feel it!) BUT...nothing happens!!!!!After all, they are both married.I loved this movie.It was like a poem, and every stanza flowed into the next."
1,Thanks for wasting 2 hours of my life.,"This movie is about 2 knuckleheads who have no life, and are boring, not funny get lost in tokyo.Its funny that the academy even wasted ink on putting this movie in oscar ballots."
1,Lost in Translation,"The movie had a couple of funny Bill Murray moments. But what a dud! Kept waiting for it to get started and at the end, all I could say was ""what was that all about"". I know the critics highly praised it, but I have to be honest about what I saw, it didn't hook me emotionally and it rather irritated me in many scenes. The only scenes that were entertaining were when Bill Murray was doing the commercial. He was very good in that."
1,Kept waiting for the PLOT and HUMOR,"Granted, Bill Murray can generally make me laugh with just his facial expressions. However, this movie was still looking for a plot when they ran the credits. I have no clue as to how this movie got the nominations and awards it did. I have a friend who LEFT THE THEATER half way through. Glad I didn't pay a cent to see it; a friend rented it then loaned it to me."
1,HYPE AND MORE HYPE,"It's totally ridiculous that Sophia Coppola has won an academy award for this. Just ridiculous. Meanwhile Kubrick, Scorcese and so many other haven't got squat. Tarantino was totally ignored in favor of THIS? Oh the hype!..."
1,BOYCOTT THIS DVD,Before you can watch this DVD you must sit through 10 minutes of Universal Studios commercials. There is no way to bypass the commercials. Please help support the boycott of this highly unethical practice of forcing customers to watch commercials. You wouldn't stand for listening to commerical on a music CD would you? Why stand for it on DVDs.
1,BORING BORING BORING!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!,"Let me first say I love great cinema, Peter Greenaway makes brilliant though slow moving cinematic ballets. Kieslowski's films are also rather slow moving, as are most European cinema YET they usually have something to say. THAT SAID, THIS FILM IS A PILE OF DUNG! Horrible, boring, no script at all, pointless, total purposeless, unfunny, uninteresting DUNG! As if Sophia's first film wasn't boring enough, she took out Kirsten Dunst and a handfull of teenage beauties and replaced them with Bill Murray (whom I usually love) and the fat lipped, creaky voiced, bare bummed, Johannson. HORRIBLE FILM, 2 hours of my life wasted never to return."
5,Best movie of past 5 years,"A lot of people don't ""get"" this movie. I guess it is too deep & intricate for these shallow thinkers. Don't worry, Fast & the Furious is waiting on ya pal. This is simply my favorite movie of all time. No movie has EVER captured a mood like this movie has. Sofia Coppola's recipe of vivid imagery and wonderfully ambient music makes you feel as if you are there in Tokyo. Coppola has impeccable taste in music, as evidenced by the Soundtrack (one of my favorite CDs ever). Watch this movie - It will take you away to another place. You won't be disappointed. ~"
2,yawwwwwwwwn....,"what can i say about this film?...i'm not quite sure.but i will say this:after all the hype of this movie...i was not impressed.i was bored and knew exactly where the story was going all the way through...although i liked the fact that there was no need for sexual display and they had their own chemistry blend going, nonetheless, it was all in all quite ridiculous.(we all have that in people we come across though -whether it being strangers or not and this was not an extraordinary event of happenings.ohhhhh, but since coppola wrote it and produced it...but of course it MUST be original (???)--miss coppola, even the 'little people' make these moments happen in a much more exciting and fun way than your little 'lost' movie did. (without sex too).yawwwwwn. miss coppola's love letter to japan? how demeaning for the japanese!want to rent something grand? go for 'son of the bride' (in spanish with english subtitles)...now that's a moving story worth tuning into. you'll feel each character."
1,Waste of time,"When I read the description of this movie, it didn't sound too interesting to me. But when I heard it was up for best picture, I thought there must be something to it. WRONG. This was a terrible movie. There was little if any story, none of it made any sense, it was full of scenes that had nothing to do with what was going on (i.e., Bill Murray staring at his razer, Scarlett Johannson sitting in the bathtub staring into space) and I never once felt the urge to find out how the story ended. I am sure that is because there was no story to end. I asked around and every person I found who had seen this movie felt the same way -- it's a dud. I love Bill Murray as an actor, but there was simply no material in this movie and there was no interesting acting (except for maybe the one scene when he was making a commercial). This movie was certainly not worth what I paid for it, and I doubt I would even recommend the $3.95 to rent it."
3,mixed pleasure,"Lost in Translation has both its high and low points. I definately like the shots of Tokyo and the wonderful cinematography not to mention the soundtrack. Both Bill Murray and Scarlett Johansson give nice polished performances that are not overacted to compensate for a script that is thin to say the least. I was expecting a little more in story/plot development after watching Sofia Coppula's the Virgin Suicides. Overall, I couldn't justify more than 3 stars, I mean even beautiful pictures can carry a movie only so far."
2,Lost in space,"Bill Murray for best actor not sure why? Lost in Transtation was dull,dry and boring it could not keep my attention,nothing really happened in this slow depressing movie of two people Bob Harris (Bill Murray) and Charlotte (Scarlett Johansson).Both were in Tokyo Bob for the shooting of wiskey commercials and Charlotte there with husband John (Giovanni Ribisi)a photographer on business.They both find one another as lonely lost soles and talk to one another about their life, and so they understand each other sounds intersting right, well two star's for trying. Enjoy!!"
1,Slower than slow,"I have watched lots of movies in my 30+ years. Many of my favorites are dramas that my friends say are ""slow"". When I heard this movie might be a bit slow, I still didn't hesitate to rent it. What a mistake! This movie never got going. It was one slow scene after another. There was little dialogue, little humor, and little of anything to be honest.Also, the movie was easy to get ""lost"" in. The Quiz show scene and many others were so brief it left one puzzled why they were even included. The acting was okay, but it gave Bill Murray little to do with such a dull script. If you are looking for good dramas I'd recommend Sea Buscuit, Radio, or nearly anything else in the video store."
1,Absolute worst,I have wasted my time and money. This movie can only excite people that have absolutely nothing to do. I thought maybe its just slow ... no its a pathetic movie with hardly a plot.
3,What was all the fuss?,"I can't deny that Bill Murray and Scarlett Johanson (Johansen?) had a certain chemistry, and there were a few moments that were funny and sad at the same time, but the overwhelming feeling from seeing this movie is the same trapped, bored feeling that the lead characters felt. Yes, we get it, Japan is a foreign culture and they both feel trapped in their lives.I saw this movie because it was on so many ""Best"" lists, and the reviews used words like ""hilarious"" and ""heartfelt."" Don't be fooled. This is not hilarious. It may be heartfelt, but the dazed and sleepy dialogue really threatens to leave you with eyes glazing over, desperately wanting something to happen.Here's the secret: it's a cute character study, but nothing ever happens."
1,"Not only lost ""in translation""... it lost me!","This movie rates only a little higher than my ""all time worst"" - and that was ""Up the Sandbox"" with Barbra Streisand... yuck! It is also the second movie which pained me so much watching it that I could not bear to inflict the entire thing upon myself. I walked out of Up... this one I just hit the ""stop"" button. No way this movie could or should have been seriously considered for best picture. Same with Bill Murray for Best Actor. Much as I love the guy in other movies (Groundhog, Knew too Little) I had a hard time believing he was ""serious"" about this role. The more the movie went on, the more it seemed that he would really rather be ""someplace else"" (not trying to act the horrible script, for example). The humor was unfathomable and had a mystic, ""should I laugh here?"" quality to it.I despised the agony I felt watching this movie. Don't buy it, rent it, or go anywhere near it. If you do, I warned you!!!"
4,S.L.O.W. -- Must Be In Right Mood,"This is a film that you have to be in the right mood for, otherwise it is way too slow. Fortunately, I was. I was physically and mentally tired. I needed something that was easy to watch, yet could get me just a little emotionally involved. This movie fit that. It is not a tear-jerker, but it does remind you of those times when you had a short period of really feeling comfortable. For some, it may be a summer romance. For others, it may be spending a warm summer afternoon with their favorite pet. The ending leaves it unknown just enough to keep you in that mood for a while. Good movie for the right circumstances."
5,You'll either love it or hate it,"And I loved it. Those who enjoy the typical Hollywood approach to film making will generally dislike this movie. This is no elaborate plot line. The characters aren't extraordinary heroes or heroines. And there are no dramatic deaths, over-the-top angst or drama. What there is, is a subtle, underlying set of emotions that you either will or will not relate to. Like most great things, this movie is not a compromise. It is not written and created to appeal to ""everyone and their brother"". And for 102 minutes of your time, I think it's worth the gamble for the opportunity to find a movie that will strike a deep emotional chord that most movies miss."
4,A very memorable film,"We all feel alone at times... this is something 'lost in translation' brilliantly shows its audience.. Indeed loneliness often, paradoxically, occurs in highly populated areas.. It is as if the more people we are surrounded by the more alienated we feel - the more our differences stand out... Bill Murray is superbly cast as the outsider celebrity guy, who dosen't seem to quite know why he is where he is, and why he is treated the way he is - in a culture and a pace of life so distant from his way of seeing and experiencing reality.. This is a very promosing feature from sofia coppola.. It captures hotel life in a way that only direct experiene could top.. This also sort of represents the zenith of Bill murray's career and perhaps his best performance to date.."
3,"Sometimes a little longwinding, sometimes funny","This movie was highly anticipated, especially because it was so highly thought of during the Oscars. It is certainly one of the better movies of last year but I can also understand why some people might not have liked it.I sometimes felt a little monotone, there are now downs or ups, which can be seen as a good or bad sign. The acting is funny and good and the American actors have done a good job acting in a way that they are completely out of place in the strange country that is Japan, this is the best of the movie in my view.The story is very good, about two people lost in Japan, a country with a strange language. This is definitely one of Murray's best parts (next to the Royal Tannenbaums) but not as good as I expected. I think Sean Penn deservedly got the Oscar that year.People interested in Japan should also watch, it's really funny what you see of Japan. Both the serene rest and the highly fluerescent lights of entertainment.Music is also good."
2,Hillarious?,"So, Rolling Stone critic Peter Travers calls this film ""hillarious"" according to the reviews on the box. Peter, please define ""hillarious"" for us. Please."
5,my favorite movie this year!,this movie had such a simple message and a simple story with a touch of humor. i've not seen a movie in a long time that made me think long after i left the theater. i can't wait for this film to be released on DVD.
1,errr?,"Bill stares out the window... Scarlet stares out the window....Bill stares at Scarlet.... Scarlet stares at Bill.The only person more bored than the characters was me.I found myself daydreaming and wishing for anything, anything at all to happen. At one point I dozed off and dreamt that Godzilla started to crush Tokyo and eat Bill and Scarlet. Wishfull thinking I guess."
1,What drug do you have to be on to like this movie?,"Really now! I know everyone has their own oppinions, but I can't see what there is to like about this movie. I thought I was the most patient person on the planet, (I even sat through Solaris) but what was the point in this movie? I'd rather count all the stars in the sky then see this movie again.It seems as if Sofia Coppola ever wants to win another oscar all she has to do is film clothing in the dryer, because this movie is that exciting."
1,How about 0 stars?,"This movie, in my opinion, is a pathetic excuse for a film. I literally was forcing myself to watch it, thinking something would surprise me at the end, but I realized I wasted my time. I actually do not understand how any human being could actually write a story about this. The plot is basically based on nothing. Well, how two strangers meet each other in Tokyo and they are bored together. Great. Where's the twist? Where's the actual plot? There is none. They just drag themselves around bars and parties being bored out of their minds.One thing I really do NOT understand, is why the majority went crazy over this movie and believed it to be a masterpice. I personally, do not find it interesting to watch a middle aged man being followed by a camera in Tokyo, and him being bored the whole time. Where is the satisfaction?Overall, I wouldn't advise anyone to rent this, let alone buy this. A total waste of time."
1,Great Movie for Self-Righteous Snobs,"I find it interesting that most reviews that give this movie 1 star bash the movie itself, while the 5-star reviews can't really explain why they liked it; they just bash the people who didn't like the movie. As one person so aptly explained, ""you need cultere"" (love the spelling!).Some people like to equate this movie to a good foreign film, but as a lover of foreign films myself, the storytelling in this one was extremely weak compared to just about anything I've seen from offshore. And why the high praise for the camera work -- average at best. Also, this was NOT a comedy by any stretch of the imagination. An all-around substandard cinema experience."
2,Not Worth Buying,"While I am a big Bill Murray Fan, and think he is truly under-rated as an actor. This movie was awful! We kept waiting for it to pick up, and be funny, but the laughs were few and far between. Even the outtakes were not funny. Photography and music was very good, but the story and dialogue was terrible. What could have been a really funny film showing the difference in Japanese vs. U.S. Culture was just a hodge podge of scenes thrown together to kill 90 minutes. If you really want to see it, wait for it to come out on Cable!"
2,Deadly dull and hideously overrated,"This movie is really nothing too special at all. Bill Murrary sits around and scowls and drinks whiskey, letting us know he is sad. He picks up a sad, hot young number at a Tokyo bar and proceeds to have a half-romantic half-platonic reltionship with her.The film's pace is as slow as a snail and the humor, while often genuinely funny, is given in small and infrequent doses.The ending is really anti-climatic, to boot.I'd recommend seeing this movie, but only because so many others seem to just love it."
1,Lost In Translation,"Maybe I just missed the whole point here, but I don't really understand why this movie recieved all of the praise it got. When I rented the DVD, I was interested to see what all the hype was about, but it's still beyond me. It was quite literally plotless. It's a bit like watching a home video of two people's trip to Tokyo. The actors are good, but they have nothing to work with. You wait the whole movie for something to happen, but nothing ever does. It's just a montage of seemingly unrelated scenes. Maybe it's just too artsy for me, but I felt that this movie was a complete waste of time. It was neither entertaining nor amusing. Very much a disappointment."
1,Wasted Translation...,This movie just proves if that you have enough marketing money...the hype will build.This movie is all dressed up with no place to go.....I saw it in the theatre and I should have asked for my money back.The script stunk. The characters are bored while in exciting Tokyo so they sit in bars and smoke and share shallow dialogue. Gee hold me back! This is one big yawn...This flick makes my top ten list of worst movies I have ever seen.
1,Over-hyped!,"I REALLY do like Bill Murray a great deal but, to paraphrase one clever critic of old, his performance in this movie went the whole gamut of A to B. The problem probably lay in the immature direction of Coppola and a creeping, boring script that perhaps tried to be subtle and ""sophisticated"" in defining characters, but failed miserably. I think the reasons why this movie got so many nominations and Oscars were, one, the name Coppola, and two, HAD TO award a woman director."
1,Regarding Ballot stuffing comment,"To the individual who wrote regarding the obvious ""ballot stuffing"" 5 star reviews by a single person here, I would ordinary think it is a joke, but the person (from Seattle) has written a pretty organized and diverse opinion for each post. This leads me to believe that maybe it is not just some fanatic writing these but maybe someone interested in making sure this film does well on amazon..I wonder who that can be? One word of advice..if you are going to take the time to write numerous reviews, try at least changing your location once in a while (watch how we will now get a bunch of 5 star reviews from other locations lol)By the way, I found the film very boring and encourage people to rent it before buying since you are very likely to be dissapointed..unless of course, if you watch movies to be depressed and bored."
1,Worst movie ever...,"This is a junk movie... no redeeming value, no plot, no anything! Total hype!Like the emporer's clothes, there is absolutely nothing there!!!An ego trip for a no talent wanna be... someone needs their olfactories checked... this stinks to no end...How low can one's level of minimal standards go? This is an insult to all movie buffs... watching grass grow is way more exciting and interesting than this tasteless waste of time and money; an insult to the movie world...Nothing there to get lost..."
2,This was tedious not subtle....,"This is Bill Murray doing his quiet I am barely here routine again. Like the guy in Broken Flowers, Rushmore and Life Aquatic. Strangely I liked all of those other movies, but this one was boring. It looks pretty and the performances are okay, but not enough happens, it is not romantic and it is most certainly not funny.People keep speaking of all these cute social observations as if they require a meticulous or intelligent mind to capture or something.I mean hello? It is no longer observationally witty to realize that the Japanese are short, have bizarre television shows and run American sit-coms with weird voiceovers. It is not much of a revelation that a person would be lonely in a strange land with different languages and customs.This is not wit or subtlety. It is unfunny and boring.I really liked the Virgin Suicides and I love Bill Murray, but I do not recommend this movie."
3,"After long anticipation, a little let down...","After all the fanfare this film recieved, after so many friends recommended it, after Amazon started bundling it with Eternal Sunshine OaSM, I finally sat down to watch this. It had some fun moments, some introspective things I could relate to, good acting and cinematography. However, I found the ending terrible, and much more could have been done with the very interesting characters she built up. I would have gladly sat through another half hour if the characters came to some new plataeu or deeper understanding of themselves. Overall the film is worth seeing, but I'll not be watching again."
1,The Academy owes me $19.99,"I would've chose zero stars but there is no option. I bought the DVD because it was nominated for an Oscar. Thinking...Bill Murray in a comedy...nominated for an Oscar...good reviews...Gotta be a good movie. One thing I require of a movie is it must be entertaining or stir emotion or stimulate reflection. This movie does nothing. It is not entertaining, It stirs no emotion (well it did make me mad that I wasted 20 bucks and an evening)and the only thing it stimulated was this review. By far the worst movie I have seen this year. I do, however, recommend that you watch it for yourself as words cannot possibly express how bad this movie is."
2,Dissapointing,"The acting is very good, the movie well carfted, but the story, simply put, is not interesting."
5,WOW,"This was one of the three best movies I saw last year. I cannot say enough good things about the performance of Bill Murray. Sofia Coppola may not have been a great actress, but she certainly is a great director. What a wonderful film."
2,Lost on me.,"I'm sorry but what's the big deal here? Lots of dead spots. The academy awards nominations were what attracted me to rent this. Bill Murray is amusing as a lonely 50 something man far from his comfort zone. Scarlett Johansson is cute & pulls off being older than her 18 years. She is also lonely in Tokyo. They find each other, bond & have some adventures in the big city. It doesn't become sexual which is good. Their affection for each other is genuine & their parting is a nice tender moment. The real star of this movie is Tokyo."
4,"Movie out on a limb, love it or hate it..","This movie is quite good. I love the revelation of Tokyo which I'm guessing is a first for most westerners. The gamer subculture glimpsed in the arcade parlor is amazing. As others have noted though, the dvd begins with a MOST annoying preview that will only let you fast forward (no disk skip or menu!). When I buy a DVD I want to be able to control every aspect of it and when a manufacturer impinges on the control of my own property it makes me annoyed and angry. Is that the emotion Universal expected from buyers by doing this? Oh and the case has no insert but it does have weird clasps which are sure to break off with repeated use. It's better than a cardboard case at least."
3,Am I missing something?,"I can't say anything really bad about this film, but I can say I was certainly expecting to be more impressed after hearing and reading all the hype surrounding it! Huh? Did I miss something?! I mean it was very well acted and I do love both Bill Murray and Scarlett Johannsen, yet, this movie left me feeling very unfulfilled. Perhaps I was let down due to all the hype, and that of course has everything to do with who the director is and hollywood politics, and nothing to do with the quality of the film itself. Not a bad movie, just not nearly as good as I expected. I anticipated being blown away, I was not, to say the least! If this type of movie is one that appeals to your taste, I won't say don't see it, I suspect you won't hate this movie, but I'll bet you've seen better!"
1,Really Really B...O...R...I...N...G and Pointless,"Unclear motivations and poor pacing make this a disappointment. Whatever was the Academy thinking when they gave a Best Screenplay to this film? Turn on the subtitles or you'll miss some of the dialogue that's made so subtle in the audio mix that you really can't hear it. The proufound alienation and artificiality of the characters is mirrored in the treatment of Japanese society. In the end, there's nobody in this movie to care about or even to like."
1,The Most Boring Movie Ever,"I saw this film in the theater. There were only two other people there. It was boring, slow-moving and had no plot. It was about two people being bored in Tokyo."
1,racist rich girl fantasy,"Narcissistic, racist and empty. Japanese people, for the crime of not being American, are sneered at by Murray and Johnanssen for an hour and a half. All those friends of yours who hated it? They were right."
1,They should force prisoners to watch this as punishment.,"I'm a hard person to bore. I can sit through the entire 4-hour direcetors cut of Dances With Wolves or a chick flic and be more entertained. This is actually boring, boring, boring."
1,ugh!,"Well, after hearing the hype about this movie I was really excited to get a chance to watch it. Two hours later, I feel as if someone owes me my money back! The movie is slow moving, and really has no point. It is just a movie about two sad people stuck half way around the world from home, hanging out for a week, and that's i t . No plot twists, no climax, nothing just ... u g h !"
1,a real sleeper,"This disc is great for those who need sleep and are afraid of sleeping pills.you'll be in snooze world before you can say, where's the remote.What a waste of talent.Murray and Johansson deserved better than this coma of a script!"
1,sigh :(,"We, my husband and myself, have never been so disappointed in a film. The good news was that the store, which we purchased it from, did an exchange for another DVD. We do realize that expectations can be a set up for disappointment, but sadly this film was just plain empty other than a few intermittent moments of humor."
2,Scenic But Goes Nowhere,"Interesting view of Japan, and Bill Murray is amusing, but there is no real plot. After a while, it just becomes annoying.I cannot believe this won an Oscar for Best Screenplay - it takes real genius to write a screenplay with lots of scenes of people sitting around, looking melancholy.It had potential, but went nowhere in the end."
1,Bad.,"If you are faced with choosing between this movie and the ""other one"", always choose the ""other one"". I do give this movie five stars, however, for its title: the title means a lack of gaining full meaning from communication and this movie itself functions as a communicative medium that presents little meaning."
2,TOSSED IN TRANSLATION,"I have little doubt this film depicts what it was like to be an American overseas during 9/11. Although it is never mentioned there seems to be no other reason for the constant inability to leave a Tokyo hotel, spend endless hours watching the tv, allow the camera to repeatedly capture the sight of Tokyo skyscrapers. It so conveys the feeling of being stuck somewhere that I felt increasing impatience and a bit of anxiety watching it. As it started, I was laughing with abandon at Bill Murray's culture clash with the Japaneese, but this initial amusement soon became restless as the culture of Japan is never seen as anything but a stereotype. Scarlett Johansson is sweet but dull as Murray's interest and Murray's character is soon diminished to a meaningless person as the director steers us into what must be her expression of 9/11. Thanks but no thanks. I have my own impressions."
2,LOST DIRECTOR AND VERY LOST MOVIE,"Lost in Translation is probably one of the worst movies ever produced. It was badly concived and terribly executed. There is nothing there but the lack of knowledge, multiple mistakes, and the non-existant talent. Why do we lie to ourselves and to others? Why is it nominated for anything? I do not know anyone who liked it and I hated it. It was so boring, wrong and predictable. Cinemas are empty when they show this film but they still show it. Well, maybe the answer is in the family. This family controlls business and there are many in the family. I wish Sophia all the best but this is not the way to enter business. I think she should try to use talent instead of connections."
1,Couldn't sleep...,"Just what went on un this film? Supposedly there is supposed to be some kind of spark between the two main characters, but where was it? No dialogue to explain why we should care. A disappointment to say the least."
1,Totally Dissapointing,I was so looking forward to this film. I love Bill Murray and I really enjoyed Virgin Suicides Coppola's early effort. But this film is such a mess I don't even know where to begin. It was trying to explore some very fascinating themes with extremely poor execution. I just didn't care about these characters when it was all over and I knew that that was not the filmmaker's intention.
1,Awful,"This is one of the worst movies I've ever seen, and it's disappointing that people made such a big deal over it. Isolation, I get it.But, seriously...what is the point, and the awkward script leaves so much to be desired. I wonder if Sophia would be allowed to make movies if she had a different last name? Is she just trying to be weird, and find some weird niche? Yes, her dad was ground breaking, so I guess those are big shoes to fill...but, then maybe you just should'nt try.The movie is boring, with little dialogue, and you don't really care what happens with the character. The setting is boring, and the movie overall is weak."
3,Overall kind of shallow...but did have a nice ending,"On the one hand I enjoyed the touchy-feely way Murray & SJ got to know one another other (I especially liked the ending myself).On the other hand I found the japanese stereotypes a bit tiresome and utterly atypical wrt my experiences. Literary license, for entertainment value, is part of life, but impacts everyone differently. The movie almost felt like an advertisement for a lopsided Xenophobe's guide to Japan.I definitely felt it was far too shallow of a movie (and too shallow acting-wise) to rank anywhere near the top of my movie ranking list.I wonder how much the 'coppola production' thing resulted in them having an easier time getting funding, and getting distributed, etc. than might've happened otherwise (?)"
2,Very Slow,This movie absolutely bored my wife and I to death. It was very slow starting out and continued to drag on throughout the movie. We didn't finish watching it because we fell a sleep. I give it a 2 because I like Bill Murray.
2,????,"I dont understand the official intelligenzia raving about this movie. Next time you are stranded by a snow storm in an airport hotel in the middle of a non-english speaking place for a week, just let run your video camera, do a bit of editing and called it a movie. Boring..."
1,"WHY PERPETUATE THE ""UGLY AMERICAN""?","THIS MOVIE IS SO BAD THAT IT BOTHERS ME THAT I SPENT $3.00 IN RENTING IT. PLEASE, PLEASE LISTEN TO ME! DO NOT BUY OR RENT THIS MOVIE. YOU WILL REGRET IT! I KNOW, I HAVE SEEN A LOT OF ""BAD"" MOVIES AND THIS ONE IS THE ABSOLUTE WORSE. LET ME TELL YOU WHY:THIS MOVIE MAKES THE JAPANESE LOOK LIKE CARTOON CHARACTERS. WE ARE TO LAUGH AT THEM TALKING ""FUNNY"" - NEVER MIND THEY ARE IN THEIR COUNTRY AND MAKING A HECK OF AN EFFORT TO SPEAK A FOREIGN LANGUAGE - I WOULD LIKE TO SEE US SPEAKING JAPANESE TO SOMEONE WHO COMES HERE FROM JAPAN TO DO A COMMERCIAL. THEN THERE IS THE ABSOLUTE ABSENCE OF INTELLIGENT DIALOGUE, STORY LINE OR ANY LINES THAT MAKE SENSE (ALL THE LINES IN THIS MOVIE SEEMED TO BE IMPROVISED AS THE MOVIE WENT PAINFULLY SLOWLY ALONG.I WISH I CAN GET MY $3.00 BACK. NOT BECAUSE I NEED IT, BUT TO MAKE A POINT. THIS MOVIE IS GARBAGE! AND IT IS A SHAME THAT WE HAVE TO SEE IT TO KNOW HOW BAD IT IS. PLEASE STAY AWAY FROM THIS CRAP!"
1,Absolutely boring...,"don't believe any of the 5 stars you see here. I am so glad I did not waste my money on this boring, senseless movie, since I saw it on cable. I was looking forward to seeing it after reading so much good things about it. Wow...what a disappointment. I kept waiting and waiting for something to develop that would justify the acclaims it received, but it never came. In the middle of the movie, I muttered to myself...""and Coppola won an Oscar for screenplay?!"" The movie is not funny, and it is not dramatic. What it is is a waste of time."
3,Men Versus Women,"Sometimes you have to be patient with your people watching, and this is the kind of movie that fills that roll. If you are an uninvolved person you might just see these as self absorbed characters... but they are actually a lot deeper.I found something profound here... although I am a guy ! If you look through the reviews here.. the guys like it... and the girls don't. This might be a reverse chick flick... so if you aren't in the mood for an action flick guys... just get this. My partner and I were at different ends of the spectrum on it. She got bored, I got enthralled. Ms. Coppolla hit on something here... maybe it's everyones middle age angst."
3,"Not Good, Not Horrible","I saw this film with high expectations and was pretty dissapointed. I'm a big fan of Bill Murray and his peformance was good, so that wasn't the problem. This movie had very little going on, I was just bored throughout the whole thing. It's about a man, Bill Murray, who is on a business trip in Japan, trying to launch an alcohol brand that he is the spokesman for. While on this trip, he meets a young woman, played by Scarlett Johanson, who is recently married and confused with what she wants out of life. The two instantly connect and quickly become close friends. Not much else goes on in this film. It's boring and I was tempted to just turn it off and do something else, but I finished it anyway. If you're a fan of Bill Murray you may like this film, but if you're looking for something entertaining, this isn't the film to pick."
3,Moves at a snail pace,"This movie moves at a snail pace but it still has its funny moments. Definitely a rent first movie..unless you are a diehard Bill Murray fan, of course."
2,Positively Pastoral-would make a good screensaver,"I really wanted to like it. I love Bill Murray's acting but this movie never gets started...and maybe that's the point...but it's still no fun to watch. It is a strangely compelling flick but in the same vein as a still life tableau. I've also never been so aware of screen changes as I was with this movie, because the scenes don't seem to flow and instead come across as an arrhythmic collage with rather random syntax. With this in mind, it might be more satisfying to put the scenes from the movie on a PC as a screensaver! In the end, however, it would probably be as maddening as the movie. Given the awards frenzy, I just can't help but think that the public has been led down the garden path by the Hollywood establishment promoting one of its own."
1,0 stars actually,"Lost in translation quite possibly one of the worste movies I've ever seen. This film dosn't even have a genre. Its just a movie about two people who are wasting there lives and in the end nothing has changed. The story doesnt go anywhere and has no meaning. Its simply a really boring film, if you can even call it a film."
1,Can I Rate it a Zero,"I rented this one, What a waste of time and money. As I have had the opportunity to travel to Japan I could not believe the self-pitying of the characters. The movie is long, slow, boring, and only really rates an R by unnecessary inclusion of a strip joint. Avoid this one if you can."
1,"Excellent and beautiful film, awful DVD","Someone else wrote a similar review, so I'm just affirming here: Lost in Translation is one of the best films of this year. It's beautiful, real and emotional and the acting is fantastic.The DVD however is junk. There's no chapter slip inside- just some advertisement for a beer company in Japan. You can't skip through the trailer after trailer at the beginning and the deleted scenes, while nice, are somewhat lacking. I expected a lot more.DO get this movie or at least watch it. But wait for a better DVD version to come out."
1,Plagarism Rewarded,"This movie's director won the Oscar for best screenplay. What no one at the Academy seems to have realized is that it was grossly plagarized from Haruki Murakami's 90's novel 'Dance, Dance, Dance'. Characters are rearranged, subplots eliminated, but the basic themes, settings, characters, and relationships are identical.(Example: in the movie, the young woman is abandoned in a large Japanese hotel by her photographer husband and taken in tow by a middle-aged man; in the book, the young woman is abandoned in a large Japanese hotel by her photographer husband and taken in tow by a middle-aged man.)In sum, the movie is a blatant, shameless, rip-off.Murakami is one of the foremost Japanese authors of our time. The fact that no one at the Academy caught the theft is a sad comment on the insularity of Americans. The Oscar should be returned."
2,Oscar Winner? How?,"Maybe its me, but i settled down to watch this with a lass 12 years my senior, hoping to be entertained and captured by this film, which many have raved about. Instead, frankly, i was bored senseless.Nothing at all grabbed my interest. I neither empathised nor sympathised with the characters, and the only thing that kept me to the end of the film is that i'd made a big deal of it myself to my companion, based on the media coverage and reviews.The story can be covered with a hugely brief synopsis. Two people, of different age-groups and sexes, in Tokyo although not really wanting to be there, are drawn to each other via the hotels bar, and become friends, both feeling gladness at the others uncomfortableness in this culture so different to what they are used to.And thats about it really. ""Dull"" doesnt seem to be a strong enough word, but perhaps i over anticipated due to the hype, so i am restraining myself from using the word ""drivel"" instead."
3,"great potential, but doesn't make it","This could have been a fabulous film. Instead, it seems the product of someone still in film school, who needs a lot of help from her teacher. It seems like a short, not a full-length film. The acting is first class, and the idea is great. Sophia Coppola needs some assistance. Certainly she got it from her father, who financed the film. I wonder if being his daughter also influenced the critics? But what she really needed from him, was help making this snippet into a film."
2,Just could not get into it.,"Boring excursion into Tokyo lacks a funny bone that could have been needed to keep this movie running along but it get bog down with too much drama, and too much head scratching on what is going on. Bill Murray is fine but he needs to get back to real comedy, Not this."
1,Don't Bother,No plot + no direction + 3 mildly funny Bill Murray scenes = 2 hours of my life I wasted. Enough said.
1,Hated It,"I heard all the accolades this movie received so I went and bought it on DVD without renting it first. BIG MISTAKE. I couldn't tell you how horrible this movie is with just a 1000 words. I am an American that lives in Japan and could relate to the characters the first time I came here, but this movie just never grabbed my attention.We passed this around to our friends who had similiar reactions. The best quote was from one friend who gave it back and said, ""I'm sorry we didn't get to finish the movie, we had to go change our sock drawer."""
3,Good movie that wasn't entertaining.,"This movie is well acted, well scripted, well...it's just a well done movie. It portrays life as it actually is, without the glamour of hollywood. They manage to capture the beauty of the seemingly insignificant relationships that you have throughout your life. How a momentary sharing between strangers can change your outlook on life. In short, this movie is about life. The problem with that, is that we get to deal with life every day. I watch a movie to be entertained, to be swept elsewhere; not to be carried back into my parents house. I am glad that I viewed the movie, but will never see it again. :o)"
5,Great,Came in very good condition. I used to work the lessons from the computer but it does not come close as having the actual book.
4,The phinal album?,"After many weeks of listening now, ""Undermind"" has taken a permanent place in my top three ""Phish"" albums, after ""Rift"" and ""Billy Breathes"". This disc is just absolutely incredible, and any fan who thinks this is bad needs to stop worshipping ""A Picture Of Nectar"" and open your ears, it's not 1992 anymore. This disc is the best of all things ""Phish"", be it jamming or pop songs, it's all here. Plus the DVD is a nice bonus too. Current favorites are ""Song I Heard The Ocean Sing"", ""Army Of One"", ""Two Versions Of Me"", and ""Scents And Subtle Sounds"". Too bad these guys are calling it a day, but what a great way to go out."
3,Not Their Best Album,"It's poppy. It's soft rock. It's more mainstream than anything they ever put out, but it still has some Phish twist in it. I'm kinda glad that they are calling it quits, cause if they kept putting out albums in their 50's, we'd see some bland rock coming from them. But it could be worse. I'm not sure if I even have a favorite song on the album, the Connection is ok, but too short, and the slow songs just seem to run together like they're parts of one huge mediocre slow song."
1,A TRAGEDY!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!,"Phish trys to go pop and horribly fails.................uninspiring , unlistenable,very disturbing , undermind. Now dont get me wrong im a phish fan (they've been my favorite band since 01 and ive been listening to them regularly since 98,seen em live a few times,blah blah blah) BUT im not a liar im not like the majority of people who think there favorite band can do no wrong. IF AN ALBUM SUCKS THEN IT SUCKS and this album sucks. I truly believe that phish just released this to cash in one more time before calling it quits. I just hope that now that there reformed they will take there time on making there next album instead of just cashing in on us poor saps(phish fans.............no i dont spell it phan or call the hampton coliseum the mothership its suppose to be a shell!!!!! if you haven't guessed by that comment im a hampton native). From what ive heard live of whats suppose to be on there next upcoming album i expect good things from Joy."
2,phish has sold out,"Phish sucks now they are a bunch of sellouts. Their studio albums are no good to begin with and this is no exception, just like round room, and farmhouse before it, this album is bad. If you like their studio albums you are not true fan and you are an idiout. Do yourself a favor and buy the live albums they are way better, even though phish sucks live now because they incorporate all their new crap. Phish is only good pre '98. Trey only cares about himself and just loves to hear himself talk...my friend does way more drugs than he does"
4,Phish's Last Studio Album,"This is definatly not the same Phish that made Junta, Lawn Boy, and other classic albums, but at the same time a better Phish then the one that made Round Room and Hoist. Not expecting much from their last cd, I enjoyed it much more then I thought I would. It is rather simplistic, but it works. If you listen expecting a Divided Sky 2 or new version of YEM, youll hate it but go in with an open mind and its not a bad album at all. With bands like Yellowcard and Story of the Year polluting rock music, its definatly a breath of fresh air."
4,Gone phishin',"This album is very poppy for Phish. Yet it still works. These guys are amazing musicians first and foremost - and this album proves they can play just about anything and pull it off. And convincingly at that. Several of the songs on this album are even air-ready for the radio, should Phish decide to take that route. Don't get me wrong - this still has elements from the Phish pond. The quirky lyrics are there, and there are some drawn out instrumentals. They are still Phish after all.Though of course, Phish is broken up now, and they mean it. And this is their last album - and they mean it. No really, after this tour, they are not touring. Ever. Again.For a discography as staggering in size as Phish's, it's easy for an album to get lost in the shuffle. I don't see that happening to this one. Highly recommended. Though, if you're looking for a regular Phish jam album, this ain't it."
3,Hits and Misses,"I bought this cd on my way to work and only heard the first three songs. I was disappointed. However, after listening to it more and more,like all Phish albums, it grows. I love the popiness of Crowd Control, Nothing, and even The Connection. Song I Heard the Ocean Sings sounds alot like Phish meets Pink Floyd. I absolutely love Access Me. It is very reminiscent of some Bowie tune that could have been on Heroes or Low. Very different, very Gordon. The album, of course, has its bad points. Undermind, the song, is just plain bad. Secret Smile is without a doubt the cheesiest song I've ever heard Phish do, and that includes Cracklin' Rosie and Hold Your Head Up. It'll grow on you if you give it a chance. However, it's no Story of the Ghost and it's certainly no Rift."
4,Phish Phinale,"The album on it's own should please most long time Phish fans. The album is all Phish, you could take each song on this album and piece it into a different part of their careeer as a band.The album doesn't personally stand out to me like ""Billy Breathes"" or ""Farmhouse"" but is still a rockin' Phish disc. Tchad Blake did an excellent job of finding a way to bring the subtleties of the screeches, wails, thumping, and pounding Phish fans would recognize live, unto the album.Highlights? ""Army of One"", ""Crowd Control"", and ""Nothing""."
5,Phish brings it home,Never on a Phish album has each member shined so brightly. Each member is given room to shine. Thus this album is truly a great way to cap off an amazing career for the phoursome. Trey shines as a songwriter and his solos are amazing on this album. Page plays his heart out on this album especially on the title track. Fishman drums really add a new element to the songs. Mike holds the bottom end and really interacts with Trey a lot on this album. Overall I would give this album a 5 out of 5. Not since Billy Breathes have the band sounded so cohesive.
4,Good Stuff,"Personally, I don't understand why everyone is slamming this record. This is the best Phish has done on a studio album. Sure it doesn't capture their live show, but this is still a great CD. There is a huge difference between a live album and a studio album. I personally was very impressed by this album, while it doesn't have their best songs, it's still a great album and its very listenable."
3,Picture Trey listening to this,"As I was listening to this album, I could picture Trey listening to it and thinking to himself, ""Yep...we're done."" The majority of songs are overly simple and repetitive. Its seems like they stuggled to come up with enough songs to make a whole album and just let anything they came up with pass. With the exception of Paige's ""Army of One"" and few other hints of Phishiness, I was for the most part disappointed. This being the direction they're heading, it does seem like this is the time for them to go their separate ways. I'm sure they would have made these songs more interesting live, as they always do, but it seems like the innovative creativity is for the most part gone. It's certainly a must-have because it's their last album, and frankly, any of their albums are must-haves. It's sad to listen to for more reasons than one. It's hard to believe that they didn't know it was the end when they wrote these songs because some lyrics are just ominous."
4,their last effort,"it is different, but it is PHISH. they are breaking up and this is a good album. i dont think it is their best but anyone who likes phish should get it and they will enjoy it. BUT THE IMPORTANT THING IS... anyone who likes phish should see them this summer, its your LAST CHANCE!!"
4,"Good as usual, but not very Phishy","What astounded me most of this album is how unlike it is to every other Phish album. Concededly, it is good, but it is equivalent to the first album of some other band. Some of the tunes are reminiscent of great jams like Picture of Nectar or Lawn Boy, but the vast majority of tunes are (and there is no other way to say it) a lot like Pop. Not really what I expected from the Phab Phour.Again, Undermind is a good solid album and a must have for every Phish enthusiast. Just don't act so surprised when it's not what you expected.One thing is for sure, every album Phish produces is always different."
2,OKPHiSH,"Much too poppy and over produced. If you want good PHiSH check out ""Round Room"" and ""Billy Breaths"". Scents and Subtle Sounds is probably the best song. It's a perfect time for the to call an end to a ""good thing""."
3,Not up to par!,"I think it all started when I first heard a phish song on a pop hits radio station in 2000 right after the release of Farmhouse. Although Farmhouse is probably my favorite studio album, it's clean it's creative and it was a new sound for Phish, it was the downfall of their creativity. I think Phish lacks creativity in this new album Undermind, they've played it out with Round Room and Farmhouse. If you're looking for a good studio Phish cd save your money on Undermind and get Billy Breathes. I'm big phish phan but all good things must come to an end right?"
1,Are you people all insane???,"How in the world can anyone like this album as a Phish album??? I mean, c'mon, this album would be ok by a freshman band trying to break into mainstream radio, but this bubble gum sheet is definitely below these seasoned veterans......their worst outing since the decline started with Farmhouse. I guess the people reviewing this album haven't seen these guyas live, because they are far better than this pile could ever reveal. After a piece of junk like this, I would break up too! In fact, I'd have listened to it, realized it sucked, hid it away and snuck off into the night!!! Mr. Anastasio needs to get back to his roots, and be a member of the band...instead of trying to be the king phish...because he has the ability to make some sweet sounds when he does that. But, hey, fame would go to my head to. I guess when you have made enough money that you don't have to practice, Trey, it shows!!! Still, I'll miss you guys. See you at Coventry."
1,stinks like a big PHART,save your money. nothing worth listening to here.remember Amy's Farm? that's when Phish was good.
4,Catchy tunes ... only one solo,"First, I'm a huge fan ... first show back in '93. These guys pretty much defined my early twenties.I found it a little shocking that there is only one guitar solo from Trey on this CD. As a guitar fanatic, this is tough for me to deal with.Overall, the tunes are pretty good and sure to become live classics, but I'm a little disappointed with the energy level on the CD. ""Undermind"" and ""Crowd Control"" are highlights, and ""Access Me"" really shows off Fishman's skill ... and Mike Gordon's strange ways ... my personal favorite.The DVD is worth watching. In fact, I understood and enjoyed the album much more after doing so. I keep picturing the mountains of vermont ... piles of snow ... forests ... well maybe even Scents and Subtle Sounds ... now I think I get it. Nice job Phish."
4,"Perfect, no. Great, yes.","I admit this isn't their best album ever, but I still find it very good, and as always, it keeps getting better with each play. Are the songs shorter and possibly more radio friendly, yes, but that's fine. If I wanted to hear ""Rift"" over and over again, I'd go listen to that. The songs I like most are ""The Connection"", ""Army Of One"", ""Two Versions Of Me"", and ""Scents And Subtle Sounds"". The DVD isn't too amazing, just them recording at the barn, but it's a cool bonus. Overall, I really like the way they're going out, and all of their music really makes me happy, including ""Undermind"". In fact, the only thing that makes me happier, is knowing that I got Coventry tickets four days before it sold out."
5,Super Easy,"Easy to install, quick, works great. Why would you want to drill a hole and install a second light bulb in your taillights, when you can use this instead and at a much better cost."
4,Positive Feedback,"Good quality razors at an affordable price, plus some very fast shipping. Thanks for a smooth transaction."
3,SLICK SCHICK,"AMAZING HOW THEY HAVE SET UP THEIR REVIEW SYSTEM SO ITS 1 AND UP 2 AND UP SO THAT MEANS THAT EVERY REVIEW WHETHER 1 ,2 ,3 ,4 OR 5 ARE ALL LUMPED TOGETHER AR EVERY LEVELLL SNEAKY SNEAKY"
3,Miles and Lester Young,"This is a collection of live recordings from various Miles Davis groups in the 1950's. Of note is a Paris concert with Lester Young. Sadly, Young's playing sounds tired and uninspired, probably as it was recorded in the last year or so of his life. Miles's playing is solid throughout and there are some interesting recordings with Sonny Rollins and John Coltrane as well who are in fact wrongly billed."
5,Hudson and Landry still a classic,"Despite the attraction of video entertainment, there is still something magical about old time radio entertainers. The universal appeal of Hudson and Landry is legendary and this CD is proof. Particularly entertaining for this time of year is the classic ""Frontier Christmas."" For anyone not familiar with Hudson and Landry, I highly recommend this CD. I guarantee you will become an instant fan."
3,Old Family Favorite,I bought this just for the Ajax Liquor Store bit. It's a classic. Depending on one's sense of humor of course.
1,Kate Smith; God Bless America,Instrumentals were good and clear However on the first track which was the only one with Ms. Smith singing (God Bless America) her voice was much deeper than it should have been. It sounded like the recording was not in speed or was dragging. I'm very disappointed with this purchase. Hopefully this was only my C.D..
1,Kate Smith - God Bless America,"Very disappointed with this product. There were only two songs by Miss Smith and the rest was ""marching"" band music. ""God Bless America"" did not sound like anybody I had ever heard before. Digitally Remastered - bah!!!"
2,well blessed,"Disappointing because I wanted a Kate Smith audio and the audio portion of this is very small. It is mainly an instrumental. It does have its title song, but that's not enough."
2,Disappointed,"I bought the CD only for one song: God Bless America, thinking that all of the stanzas would be on it. All that was on this cut was the chorus. What a disappointment."
3,BEWARE - Kindle Option is Not the Mitford Translation,"I was pleased to see that the Kindle format was free--until I downloaded it. Turns out, it was free because it' the old public-domain download (the translation of which is amost a century old) instead of the far more readable Mitford version.I DO recommend ""The Princess of Cleves,"" and free downloads are nothing to spit at, which is why I still gave this a 3-star review. ""The Princess of Cleves"" is an excellent example of literature from the Age of Reason, because the heroine (never given a first name) is so driven by public appearnce and virtue and proper behavior. I'm also a sucker for the Henri II & Diane de Poitiers romance, some of which plays in the background of the Princess of Cleves' story.But seriously, I do recommend the Mitford translation. Those downloading to Kindle, be aware that you'll get a far more stilted read."
2,Poor translation,"I was reading away happily at the original French version (struggling occasionally over some of the older vocabulary) until I realised I really didn't have enough time (essay due in tomorrow evening), so I quickly nipped round to a friend and borrowed this translation.And it's not good, people, not good.While parts of it have travelled quite nicely from French over to English, a lot of it is very badly done - some word for word tranlations and FAR too many repetitions of words. For example, I'm sure I came across 'agitation' three times on one page, and I can tell you I ended up more agitated than Mlle de Chartres ever would be after trying to scrape my way through it.Needless to say, I'll be allowing more time to read these books beforehand so that I don't have to delve into another poorly translated version again.Get it in French."
2,Pointless,"Allegedly the music is lost in the translation, and since the novel reads like an encyclopedia entry i wouldnt bother unless you have no choice. Such and such married such and such who begat so and so... Almost absent of conflict and plot. I'm sure its 'important' literature, but leave it for those who care."
2,It's ok...but there are better ones,"This cd rom slot style is an alright game just as long as you don't have anything else to play. If you have any others, they would be more interesting than this one. The game has some fun bonus rounds but there are not that many. My advice is to find something else like Reel Deal Slots Nickel Alley."
5,Breath Easy,"After reading customer reviews, I did additional research about the product.All good. Without any modifications ( performance parts ) I will gain MPG with my car."
4,Useful reading for both software developers and project managers,"If you've been or had been working on a software project, you will know what George is talking about. Small of big, a software project never fail to challenge you with every-growing requirements (so the complexity), unexpected obstacles, and never-enough-time. The book well analyses the nature of software project and provides a good insight of the real challenges/issues we face when working on a software project, so to help us deal with them better. Very useful to read."
5,Real,"Barrels full of people say Blood for Blood sound too silly. Ostentatious and unapologetic both in sound and philosophy I have always seen more depth than they are ever given credit for. Blood for Blood feel their pain like a bar brawl and a fit of lonely tears. No the introspection is not frilly sleeved but it is there in the crushing blood soaked lyrics. There is no allusion or allegory it's all laid out on the bar, in your face. Blood for Blood mean it. No messing around.A great album!"
5,Its Blood For Blood!,"you can never go wrong with a blood for blood cd, on of the slower more intense cds from them"
2,Nice looking but a wobbly,"This cane arrived quickly and was packaged carefully.The pros: comfortable, seemingly durable foam handle; it's easy to adjust for different heights; nice color and finish.The con (and it's a big one): it's slightly wobbly. If you place it flat on the ground and apply slight pressure to the handle, it wobbles as though one foot is slightly shorter than the other three. Upon closer examination, that was exactly the case! I went to a local drugstore to look at others. Maybe is was suppose to be that way, I thought. However, the quad canes I found at RiteAid were much more stable. Their legs were all of even length. I read a similar complaint about this a Duro-Med cane so I can't help but wonder if this company is trying to unload the canes that weren't manufactured properly."
5,Amazingly insightful,"As a now part-time, but previously full-time graduate student in a doctoral program I can say this is an amazing piece of work. It is incredibly insightful and provides a great deal of humor in what can sometimes be a tough situation. I have totally enjoyed this series online and will be buying the other collections as well."
5,Got me though my PhD,"This is a great book. His humour is so spot on - it really is a great representation of grad life. This first book also shows how the strip has progressed over time - the artwork and the story arcs have developed a lot.A comic book that is extremely cathartic - and yeah, It really did help me get through my PhD."
5,"Sigh, the life of a grad student","You think you have unique problems in grad school. Then I read PhD comics and realized that ALL grad students have the same problems. Even though you can go for DAYS not talking to another human (professors don't count!), Cham describes our lives accurately! :) It's a perfect gift!"
5,This book saved my life!,PHD is a great source of Ramen and procrastination. It makes you love and embrasse your inner geek... It totally rocks!!!
2,A disappointment,"I bought this book due to the recommendations listed here and was very disappointed! Not only was the print quality of the book very poor, the comic strip was only mildly amusing at best. This was surprising to me, because as a Ph.D. student, I am intimately aware of the insanities associated with grad student life, and thought they would be humorously profiled here. Although a few of the strips made me smile, none of them evoked the rolling on the ground laughter that I was hoping for. I guess I will have to find another diversion from my thesis! :)"
5,creatively funny,i have been following Jorge Cham's work for a while now and i must admit that i find almost every one of his cartoons painfully truthful and funny.This is a good compilation of some of his best works.
5,Third Day Rocks,THird Day is a Super great awsome christian band. I listened to these guys before I was a christian. Now my wife and 4 children love Third Day too. God Bless.
3,"One album, only one good song","Im not wasn't so glad when I first listened to this cd, I thought all the songs I listend to where bad untill I got to the song ""thief"". I think that song is so good! Its a sad song but good. I am giving the 3 stars to the album for putting thief on the album, and the actaul song ""thief"" Im giveng 5 stars. I think Third Day should sing this song again, and have it get really popular. Everyone who believes in Jesus Christ should hear this song."
4,Buy the CD just for the song 'Thief.',"Buy this CD just for the song 'Thief.' I nearly wept the first time I heard it. The song's perspective is from one of the 'thieves' who died on a cross next to Jesus. Simply stunning! Kudos to the guys in Third Day - I have two Third Day albums and enjoy them both! Thank you, gentlemen, for bringing me closer to God."
5,THIRD DAY (WOW),"GREAT CHRISTIAN ROCK I OWN MOST ALL OF THEIR MUSIC,ONE OF THE BEST SONG ON HERE & BELIEVE THERE ARE ALOT OF THEM BLACK BIRD IS A GREAT TUNE"
5,"great songs, awesome lyrics, great sound","Can you say, ""ROCK!"" ? These songs are awesome and so is the band. Penetrating lyrics that actually mean something and a great sound to boot. You can listen to this CD front to back over and over... it's like a greatest hits CD. If you heard ""I've Always Loved You"" on the radio and liked the sound, get this CD, it is awesome and all of the songs are of the same caliber as those that get radio airplay. A mix of acoustic, folk and alternative rock that is just awesome. I've seen these guys in concert twice and their sound just never gets old."
4,"Good, worshipful music","I purchased this on the strength of the single ""Consuming Fire"" and have since gotten into some of the other tunes like, ""Holy Spirit"". Don't exactly know all the names of the songs I like, but I do here secular influences on certain songs in the music itself, but the lyrics are all God, all the time. Wouldn't have it any other way. I was enthused to check out the humble begininings of this prolific Christian rock ensemble & it did not disappoint. God bless!"
5,Awesome Third Day CD,"This CD is an absolute must for any Third Day fan. It contains many Third Day classics, like Love Song, Thief, Consuming Fire and Take My Life. Many other good rock songs are included on this debut album as well. I absolutely love this CD."
5,excellent..excellent,Third Day CD was givin to me as a gift from a nice lady in Holland who knows the band.Powerful stuff and the best song writing I heard in years.
1,Sleepless instead of Sleepy,"This product helped me to sleep. But, I then wake up every 30-45 minutes for 2-3 hours. It's happened several times, and I didn't connect my usage of this product with the strange sleeping patterns until it happened repeatedly. Never had the problem the other brands. Tossing the remainder."
5,Does it really need to take 20 years!,"Finally ... a happy ending after 2 decades! I found this sequel a week after the original and was glad to see a happy ending. Love doesn't die and can persist no matter how many years, activities, distractions, and justifications you come up with. When the old lovers are reunited they actually don't mess it up this time! A happy ending is rare in French films. Watch this and weep. Great to watch the duo with Before Sunrise/Before Sunset. It plays on the same kind of theme of lost time and memories."
3,Hard to understand,"I have to assume this video was intended for young people to view so that they might be inspired to learn to play an orchestral instrument. I have tried showing it to my upper elementary students and they lose interest quickly. I believe this is in part due to the difficulty of understanding Sir George Solti. I have run several of his statements back four or five time and still cannot understand what he's saying. I think it is interesting that the DVD has subtitles in four or five ""foreign"" languages, when what it really needs are subtitles in English so people can understand Solti!As a musician, conductor and teacher, I personally found the DVD quite interesting, especially the discussion of how the orchestra has evolved over the centuries. But the difficulty of not being able to understand what is being said causes the entire production to fall short of its goal."
4,Secrets of the Vine,This book was suggested by a friend.Am reading more religiously inspirational material.Excellent book. I would recommend it to anyone who is growing in their faith-walk.
5,Secrets of the Vine Bible Study,"A profound, enlightening reveal of God's love to His people through the process of spiritual pruning to bear ""more fruit."" Something every believer in Jesus Christ should understand to be able to have joy in walking through it."
5,love these sponges,"I have been looking for sponges like this in stores and could not find one anywhere. This sponge holds together, where others fall apart after using a couple of times. Great product!"
4,Just what I was looking for,"After looking in every store I could think of for these sponges, I thought I would have to give up. I even tried other types and most were too scratchy. And I really dislike those nylon puff balls. Pretty as they are they just aren't my cup of tea. So I was thrilled, actually, to find these at Amazon. They are exactly what I was looking for. Thanks!"
4,SHOWER SPONGE,"THE SIZE OF THE SPONGE IS A LITTLE LARGER THAN I LIKE, BUT IT HOLDS A LOT OF SUDS. I WILL BUY THESE AGAIN IN THE FUTURE. I ONLY USE WASH RAGS FOR SHAVING."
2,"its ok, buy the one at target, its the same","its the same as the sponge u get at target, i own both, and i feel i wasted s/h charges to get this. i DONT recommend it."
4,The album that announced Horn's breakthrough!,"Apparently, this very album was the first after 10 years of no-recording. AND in fact her recording debut as a self-accompanying singer, as we know her all now.It displayed her mature style and versatility (she swings, soars and entrances). On the strength of this album Shirley Horn began to receive invitations to tour, which resulted in the succesful career when, 9 years later, Verve Music signed her and she finally started a full-time performer life.My favourite tracks here are ""Why Did I Choose You?"" (a typically powerful Horn interpretation), the title track, and ""New York's My Home"".While I was so glad to find she recorded the great Brazilian standard ""Gentle rain"", it's eventually no real disillusion that she doesn't sing this one; her instrumental rendition gives us no less than 10 minutes of atmosphere!(4 stars for a Shirley Horn album, 5 stars for a jazz album)"
3,Sounds great.. but how do you apply it?,"The product works great-- but is difficult to apply. I should have ordered the spray bottle type. This product is so thick, you can't spray it. Only option is to dump in a pail and us a paint brush to brush on."
4,New insight into how young you can be and remember.,It is amazing to think that babies in the womb are so aware of things that are happening to mother and father. I found it very insightful to think that so many things may have begun before birth and brought to fruit only after being born. I wish that there was a volumm II since the book was written so long ago.
2,Allisya,"I love bratz and I am new here. I just start to like Bratz and also My Scene. I don't like this theme so much co'z of their hairs. I don't like their hairs. It's ugly but there's a lot of stuff that came along with this doll. I love the Princess, Tresures, Genie and Rockz Anglez theme. Not my favorite theme.``!!~~Allisya~~!!``"
1,Just thought id like to say.........,"What a rubbish doll!I hate Bratz but I have my reasons......like:they copy myscene(see my other review for Chelsea Masquerade madness),they break all the time and there really big headed lacking feet,weird proportions and gross angry snobby faces!DONT BUY THIS DOLL!!If you have,(what were you thinking...sell it quick and buy a myscene(i personally recommend Kenzie but they all rock! Thankyoou!!!!!!"
3,This bratz un cool,I am a major bratz luver iim 15 which is old for dolls but is so cool except dis one cloe and sasha look amess ive been to tokyo and they do not look like cloe or sasha they dis gust me
1,Breaks Easily,This controller is not good quality and mine broke in around 3-4 weeks. Better if you buy the Official Funtastic Controller by Nintendo. If you dont have the money to pay $$$ for the official one.. I suggest you buy the Mad Catz Advanced Control Pad which costs the same and feels just like the Real controllers + has comfortable hand grips + slow motion and turbo mode buttons.
1,Garbage,"Purchased 2 (in black)... if you drop it, it is garbage. The pad holds-up for 2 weeks of constant use. The joystick hesitates after a month of use. Not a good product at all. DON'T WASTE YOUR MONEY."
1,Horrible,"I bought this THING a week ago(6/9/00), it broke today(6/17/00). On top of that, it was sooo hard to grip. I have 10 games and it's bad with all of them. Trust me, get a regular controller."
1,A Frustrating Read,"I started reading this book for a research paper on hostage taking situations. However, after three chapters, I had to put it down. It is poorly edited (missing apostrphes, etc.) and poorly written. Griffiths has an annoying habit of injecting his own opinion and politics into the text. Although I had hoped that the book would still be useful as a resource for my paper, I finally realized that it was not credible source."
5,"Makes you think and laugh, dammit!","I think this is one groovy book! The graphics are sharp, and add to the lighthearted approach the author has taken to a heavy, heady subject (i.e. how (why?) individuals fit into the bigger scheme of the universe). You don't have to be an expert in chaos theory or zen or anything to understand, and ENJOY this book. Buy it, read it!"
1,**NOT** for cynics,"This book is billed as a ""cynic's guide to spiritual happiness."" I am a cynic, and this book is not for me. It's just another variation of the power-of-positive thinking, be-happy line of thinking I was hoping to avoid.My advice to genuine cynics: avoid this book."
2,"Meh. Not for me. Preaching to the choir, sorta.","To a cynic this is a humor. to a ""Normie""(aka- average person off the street, stupid) this is a self help, by illustrating to you some common views that commonly float about a Cynics mind. With pretty, glossy pictures, varyingly inconsistent text size ,and a damn flower on the front. Theres more stock imagery in this then Microsoft office 03. So, should you buy it, or not. If you read this and understood it, don't. if you didn't, still don't. (it originally was $14.95... now its selling for less then one dollar.)"
2,Moving right along...,"The funniest part of this book is the title. After that it's a bit 'try hard'. Some parts are funny, but basically it is too simple an approach of a serious topic, and hence, much of it isn't either particularly funny or helpfull. There are so many more books on subjects such as 'the law of attraction' that are better value, and humorous books that are funnier, that this book wasn't worth the trouble, in my opinion. If you want a good laugh I recommend you buy something else. If you want a self-help book I recommend you buy something else."
5,"I totally recommned this book, dammit!","The last few months have been very ""challenging"" for me...so a friend gave me this book. I was skeptical at first that any book get me to shift my emtoional state...but I gotta say this book definitely did! I laughed as I read it...which helped me to kinda feel better right away...BUT... mostly (and surprisingly) I found its insights and advice very VERY helpful to get me to a stronger emotional place to make the changes I need to make..and make them I did. I totally recommend this book to anyone out there who is in that ""challenging"" place in their life. I also loved Ms. Salmansohn's THE 8-MINUTE GUTS BUILDER...which also motivated me to make some needed changes in my life. Thank you Ms. Salmansohn! Thank you, thank you, thank you!"
5,"Great Gift for that ""refuses to be happy"" person you know","Like me, I bet you know someone who just seems to refuse to be happy, no matter what, year after year after year ...I have known my friend ""Z"" for 15 years. She always has something to complain about. No matter how well the day, week, month, or year is going, she will tell you stuff she is anxious about, that she just has to complain about, etc. etc.Really, some years are better than other. But she won't admit it. I get it now -- she refuses to be happy; complaining is her habit, her worldview, her addiction.So I gave her this book for her birthday to say to her, please learn ""How To Be Happy - Dammit !!"" This is a fun but also provocative book in that it communicates more than just humor. If this does not work, I'll give her the longer, more serious book 'Addicted to Unhappiness' to try. But I'm hoping Salmansohn's attractive gift book will communicate my message to my friend. Worth a try."
2,"Too simple, not real life.","Too simple. Relationships, love, careers and life take work. It is give and take. It is easy to say, ""It's not working, get rid of it"", instead of working at it. It is give and take all the way around. This book tells you to think of you and only you without a thought of others - that is selfish. Yes, we want to be happy, but you can't keep throwing people, work, things away because it is not working the way you want (what are you going to do if the next way doesn't work, get rid of it too?) You need a balance in life, work and love, it is finding that balance that you need to think about."
5,Great fun - and great advice,"The writing style is breezy and fun - but the book has some deep truths and strong advice as well. My favorite part came at the end - I won't spoil it though! The graphics for the most part reinforce the messages, but get perhaps a little overdone. Still though, it's a 5 star book all around. Enjoy!"
2,A little confused,"This would be a great ""jumping off place"" for pre-teens and/or teenagers just beginning their journey of self development. I feel it was a tad elementary for adults. The giant fonts and clip art would, however, appeal to the younger set. I don't like to be too critical of any author but I do feel the reviews were a little ""over the top"" and that's what I went by when purchasing this book. It just wasn't my style but who knows, someone else might find it inspiring. We are all in different places in our lives."
1,"Sweet, but useless","This is a very quick read: each page with one paragraph of nice, simple, quirky inspirational phrases. This is a great book for post-pubescent kids trying to cope with their hormonal fits of confused, low self-esteem, puppy love sadness. I, however, struggle with clinical depression. I need a text with substance and insight that will help me deal with this illness. These cute, quirky, inspirational, abstract phrases do absolutely nothing for me."
5,Years of therapy in a nutshell!,"I caught this book while out with a friend, and we both wound up buying the book. It's a fabulous, fun, witty, deep little book that is an excellent guidebook for life. Yay for this book!"
3,Annoying print,"I have no idea what I expected but definitely something higher than kindergarten type of print and upside down pictures.Next thing would have been what? Counting numbers on you hands?Some drops of wisdom, but totally eroded by the mode of presentation, at least for me."
2,"Fun book, bad shipping experience","The book itself is fine, but I got it as a gift and during the shipping it get messed up, the seller did not cover it with anything and put it in the box with other stuff I ordered which was heavier, and the book got damaged during the shipping, I had no time to get the other gift so I had to explain what happened to the person I got it for. Wasn't very pleasant thing to do. But the book it self is fun and my cynic friend liked it. :-)"
5,What a pity that this book is out of print,"Germaine Greer takes no prisoners in this extensively researched, insighfully analytical account of human fertility - and the First World's influence upon fertility in the developing world. Unlike many progressive thinkers hesitant to criticize the family planning movement for fear of landing themselves in bed with the ""radical religious right"", Greer takes on Planned Parenthood founder, eugenicist Margaret Sanger; her cohort, Marie Stopes; UNFPA; USAID; and more. A caustically-written yet somber look at the harm incurred by both misguided and insidious meddling in foreign affairs."

2,Dated.,"There are far better Italian progressive rock bands than this outfit. This particular recording does not hold up well over time. The vocals in particular sound quite dated. The organ/keys, bass and drums trio is nothing better than competent.For a better intro to Italian prog see PFM, Banco del Mutuo Soccorso and Le Orme....Simon"
3,Software Version Updates,"The unit itself works well. However, Parrot has periodic software updates which are difficult to download to your computer, then to cell phone, and then moved to the car unit. The computer must have bluetooth, or serial cables are required to connect the phone to pick up the updates for transfer to the Parrot. Parrot does not service Mac's.Very importantly, there is no OFF button or switch in case you don't want it operational. What? Something you can't turn off easily? What is the manufacturer thinking?"
3,Parrot Review,"I do LOVE having hands free communication in my car. My only complaint at this point is that when you are talking with someone else that also has a hands free unit in their car, it is very difficult to hear each other."
5,Excellent,The Parrot works great once you figure it out. The directions that come with it need help. You'll need to purchase the correct wire harness for you car seperatly. I did the install my self and took about 1hr to do. It took longer to get the phone to work with all the features.
2,Horrible Support - Decent Product but support really SUX,The product is good and works pretty much as advertised. My problem is with their support. I had the problem for only a few months and it developed a problem where the MIC does not work any more. Nobody can hear me when I am talking.I opened a support case through Parrot's fancy website that makes you think something will happen quickly but it is a week now and I haven't heard back from Parrot Support at all. Even after putting in multiple notes and raising the urgency of the case to Critical.Everyone has some problems with their product and I can live with that. The big test is how the company responds to and addresses these problems. Parrot has rated an F. Big FAILURE in support rating.Look at other similar products if you can.
4,Extra Parts Needed,"The Parrot CK3200 is an excellent bluetooth device for your car or truck. However, this item is manufactured in Europe where all vehicles come equipped with ISO connectors on all sound systems. If you are intending to install this item in a vehicle sold in the U.S., you will need ISO adapters. My 2004 Chevrolet Pickup with the Bose Sound system required two adapters at 20 dollars each. The install was 50 dollars on top of that. I still like the system, but want to make sure all buyers are aware of this fact. If you have questions, contact a local stereo installer and they will tell you if they have the adapters needed."
1,"Works great, but only when outside temp is under 70.","This unit has a serious problem with overheating. Anytime the car interior is warm the 3200 will display a white screen. Other reported issues include intermittently cutting off the stereo sound or getting a black screen. Parrot has not acknowledged the overheating problem, but it has been reported on several different forums.Great unit, but only if you live in Antarctica."
5,Gearing to Go Video,"This video is ideal for people who want to learn how to ski or snowboard. First-time participants will see how to use their equipment, what they will learn in a new skier or rider lesson, and how to use the chair lift.New Skiers & Riders Gearing to Go Guide"
1,useless,"that is useless it is not an instruction that is a small video showing what to take for the mountain and how to put the equipments, can you imagine that is ridiculous you find better videos in youtube. I don't recommend."
4,A forgotten near-classic,"In the spring of 1945, with the war winding down in Europe, Nick Leonidas is one of the thousands of GIs who have become deserters, hiding out in Brussels and Paris. Dodging the seemingly ever-present MPs, trying to survive by selling stolen goods on the black market, Nick struggles to stay free and to maybe even find a way home.All in all, I thought this was a good book. A fascinating premise and a quick read. And if not a flashy writer, Linakis is a sold one. While there are the occasional slow spots, he knows how to keep a reader's attention. ""In The Spring The War Ended"" isn't a great book but you could do a lot worse."
3,kids love it,"The dispenser looks cool on the countertop and my kids love being able to get their own cereal anytime of the day, but what a mess it makes. The internal wheel crushes the cereal as it dispenses, sending crumbs all over the place. If I had to do it all over again, I'd just stick to the cereal box."
2,works but not for large cereal or large bowls!,"works great for cheerios....but not well for large granola clusters. granola clusters dont seem to come out easily at all. ALSO you can not fit a large bowl under the dispensor, it works for small and short bowls ONLY. Very small room for the bowl. Also, with tax this is appox 50.00, so not cheap."
2,arrived cracked,"Ordered 2 units, 1 plastic container arrived cracked. Finally, after no response to 2 emails, called customer service and was told a refund will be issued. You must keep the cap on the bottom or the cereal does go stale, I like the design but would like to see a declining barrier on the top of the cereal that goes down as the cereal goes down to keep the air out."
5,I love it!!,I am a cerealholic. I mix different kinds of cereal and it was getting time consuming.I went to one of the hotels that has free breakfast and I saw the Zevro for the first time.Mary was with me and she said it was perfect for my mix. I bought it and I do not regret it.
2,Expensive and messy,The dry food dispenser is nice to look at but very MESSY...cereal falls out of the dispenser after you are finished dispensing...save yourself the hassle and expense and keep serving cereal the old fashion way...out of the box!
3,The hill thrill,"Not a bad mix with some of the Cypress Hill crew scattered throughout the cd, B Real has a good verse in track 2 and Sen Dog has a few. Some of the Hill metal music tracks are on this which i wasnt huge on but you got to try new things i spose."
3,Fantastic Victory - Israel's Rendzvous with Destiny,"Just a hard book to read, full of war, etc. but I really liked reading the ending about the end times and the prophecies regarding Israel, etc."
3,heavy,"This tool is too large for head bolts and other mechanical products that are not designed to accommodate such a large tool. The required opposing action to loosen the fastener is equal to a normal rachet. As one has to hold the opposition bar stable while loosening a fastener. This tool was much more difficult to operate than I expected. I returned it for credit, which was easy but expensive to do."
5,Genre-rama,"In ""Snake Agent,"" the ever-clever Liz Williams concocts a tongue in cheek brew combining the police procedural, the horror tale, fantasy, and science fiction. Set in an alternate Earth that seems to be a few years beyond our present, it features Singapore 3's (don't ask what happened to Singapore 1 and 2) Detective Inspector Chen, the police inspector involved with the supernatural--the snake agent of the title. (This is the first of a series, but it's complete in itself.)His current case leads him to hell, where he teams up with Hell's Seneschal Zhu Irzh in order to thwart a vast conspiracy involving one of Hell's many bureaus. Ms. Williams has serious issues with bureaus and the 'crats who run them (she's shown this before in an earlier novel, ""Empire of Bones""), a fact that figures prominently in this novel's clever plot.Wittily written (the characters often speak in phrases that evoke Jack Vance's--hardly a bad thing), cleverly plotted, the book's a total delight."
4,Great series,"Really enjoyed the first book, whipped through the next couple as well, awaiting the fourth, have the fifth sitting on my Kindle. Like the glimpses of the future dystopia and enjoy mining the books for hints about the how and why of Singapore 3. Interesting characters through the books, enjoy the increasing disconnect of Heaven vs pretty much everyone else. Gory in spots.The thing I don't understand is: if Earth is the place where ""the balance is worked out"" (Miss Qin, Book 3, I think) why is Hell multi-level yet Heaven seems to be only one dimension and a pretty cardboard one at that?"
3,"Entertaining enough, but not substantial","If you ever wanted to read a crime/supernatural novel about a Chinese detective who descends into Hell, Snake Agent is the book for you. To be honest, it is not my kind of book; I prefer more substantial fiction. However, it achieves what it is supposed to achieve: It is breezy and entertaining, with likable characters, interesting ideas, and some humor. I compare it to Jim Butcher's Dresden novels or Glen Cook's Garrett books. You read them to be entertained; you don't expect complex characters or storylines or lyrical writing. As long as you don't expect those elements in Snake Agent, you will probably enjoy it. If you want to read a better fantasy with an Asian twist, I recommend Bridge of Birds by Barry Hughart."
1,Don't bother,"I do not know Ms Williams, and this was the first of her writings I read. I will not read any more. Others have done this genre better, without stooping to a world view that inculcates so much that is gratuitously evil. Writers like Randall Garrett have been able to successfully blend both Christan and pagan aspects,without denigrating either. I felt it ironic that while Christian icons were used to repel evil, Ms. Williams found it necessary to mock Christ "" the dead Christian god"". I am sure her regular audience would expect nothing less of her - I will not be counted among them."
3,Liz Williams... Lite,"The book is well written, but did not present anything truly novel. For the most part, it felt like a TV series. Also, I'm not sure whether or not it's because I'm Chinese, but the ""Chinese"" theme didn't work its magic on me. I guess I also expected something... deeper. I have read ""Nine Layers of Sky"" and ""Banner of Souls"" and Liz Williams did so well in presenting some pretty interesting novel ideas there. All in all, I feel Snake Agent is a good read, but not something extraordinary."
3,A pleasant read,"Clever twist on the crime procedural with mismatched partners, but slow-paced, and rather flatly written. I enjoyed it well enough, but I won't be picking up another volume in the series."
4,British craftiness,"The paranormal investigation sub genre is pretty crowded field. I've read quiet a few of them over the last few years, and the thought of reading yet another one practically had my eyes rolling back in my head and foam frothing from my mouth. None the less, I found this novel to be quite hard to put down. It's inventiveness certainly raises above it's competition. Part ode to the pulps of yesteryear, part mystery, part new weird and set a few beats into the future, it's all guided by Williams' gently erudite British craftiness into winning combination. I'll certainly be reading more of her work with pleasure. This one is Good Fun!"
4,An exciting story for any Star Trek fan.,It was very exciting. Once I got started I couldn't put it down. I have started reading all of the Star Fleet Academy Star Trek The Next Generation books. This is a must for any Star Trek fan.
2,didnt work,"My friend own one of these and it made a drastic changes in the quality of the tone. so i had to get one for my self. But the one i got didnt work as my friend's own. i could hear an improvement on the tone but i could barely hear it cause it create a very loud hum. mine didnt eliminate any hum, it created hum. so i could not use this at all when i am playing. I tried all kind connections and wires it still makes a loud hum. so i borrowed my friend's hum eliminator and all of a sudden, no hum. so it not my connection."
2,Product requires amplification,"This product has a tremendous washed-out quality when plugged in without amplification. I don't have an amp and can't test it with one until I do, but I have tested it with my VCR and laptop going to a surround 5.1 speaker system. They worked fine, nice and loud before but the laptop used to run with a ground-loop hum that was kind of annoying. Now the sound is anemic and has the quality of listening through a soup-can telephone system (phantom reverb, small echos, totally washed-out sound and very weak.) On the upshot, it completely got rid of the ground loop hum. Now I'm searching for an amp that works with 1/2"" plugs. This may be a goose-chase though and I may wind up returning it to where I got it (not Amazon unfortunately.) If you're looking for un-amped ground-loop elimination, look elsewhere."
1,Degrades audio and adds hum,"I bought this since one of my laptops (generic brand) had a ground loop problem when connected to my powered monitors (KRK RP-5 G2) and I was trying to fix it.With the laptop causing problems, which has a power supply cable with an earth pin, it does reduce the hum when using XLR-cables (although still adible in the signal). With my other laptop, which does not have an earth pin on the power supply cable (Dell Vostro 1500), however, it adds a serious amount of high pitched noise, clicks and hum to the signal when no noise was present before. Due to this reason I sincerely recommend against buying this, as for some devices it works, but for others it apparently does the opposite of what it is supposed to do."
3,decent,This CD was delivered promptly. The only problem I have is there were a few scratches on the disc and some of the songs skip
4,Truly Uplifting,"This is a must-have CD for your contemporary Christian music collection. If there is an album that I could call 'divinely inspired,' then this is one of them. It is truly uplifting, for those times when things get a little too much to bear. The music plays like scripture in song."
5,Inspirational & Divine,"My favorite song by Kathy is ""My Life is In Your Hands"". That song ministered to me very deeply and at a point where a lot of things in my life didn't seem to make any sense. But the song reminded me that no matter what I go thru, that God is always in control, even if I don't understand it. I just Praise God for using her as a reminder of His faithfulness and goodness. He is indeed an awesome and wonderful God!"
4,"No more golf, just bones, please!","This is another fascinating forensic mystery in Elkins' Gideon Oliver series. Considering how I dislike gory stories, I am always surprised how much fun and interesting the forensic details are in his books. Really, Aaron should stay away from those boring golf mysteries with his wife and stick to the bones!"
3,Shallow treatment of Tahiti,"This book is fairly standard Elkins material, but personally disappointing to me in the shallow treatment of Tahiti, where the novel is supposedly set. Not at all true to life as it is lived on Tahiti, the coffee plantation should have been sited on the Big Island, where this kind of coffee growing is done. While some coffee is grown in Tahiti, most of the local coffee comes from the Austral Islands, and is not a premium product. The author only spent a week in Tahiti (I spoke to him at a fund-raising auction- we were interested because we had lived down there for several months on two occasions). Readers wanting to get some idea of daily life on Tahiti will not find it here."
2,not very good...,i'm not mormon but i've read several outlines of their faith. half of this winded and detailed outline drags on and on. Zzzzzz....
4,"Good, solid jazz","Bags and Mr. T(urrentine) - enough said. They have each made better recordings and have been involved with more suitable pairings and groups, but neither one ever made a bad record to my knowledge and although the results here are uneven it is still a worthwhile example of straight-ahead funky jazz from the seventies. Some memorable cuts and some just decent background grooves."
5,Still my favourite book of all time!,"Sophie hatter is one of the best charcaters ever to be created, she is my role model in life. I first read this book when I was about ten years old, I'm now in my twenties and I read it at least every few months. Diana Wynne Jones is the funniest writer I've come across (for children or adults). I adore Calcifer the fire demon...I wish he'd come and live in my fire. If you haven't read this book, you've wasted your life!"
4,Howl's Moving Castle is a Delightful Fantasy,"I first saw Hayao Miyazaki's animated film and read this book afterwards. It was really a double treat because the film and the book are vastly different and they are both excellent. Diana Wynn Jones is a good storyteller and writer,. You will especially like her work if you amongst the Harry Potter crowd. Miyazaki's film however, is an absolute must-see adventure-romance epic. He changed plot elements that didn't work and cast his magic animée spell and a materpiece was created. My whole family was enthralled with it and watched it many times over."
5,Wow!,"A delightful experience to read this book. Very imaginative and original. I recommend it fully! I want to see the movie, but I don't think it could be better than the book"
4,"Something of a mish-mash, but quite inventive","This YA fantasy novel moves at a breakneck speed, and some of the action scenes would be better suited to a faithful movie adaptation than the printed word. It was too hyper for my tastes, with too many important side characters, but I was eager to see what happened. It is very different from the movie of the same name,Howl's Moving Castle, which shares only the title, the moving castle setting, and some character names; the tone, plot, and most of the characters in the movie are vastly different from those of the book. I found the book better suited to the younger audience; the dark political message of the movie was unsettling even to me as an adult. But if you like this book, be sure to check out Terry Pratchett'sThe Wee Free Menfor a similarly spunky young heroine."
4,A fun book,"I had to read this for a class and I have to say I actually enjoyed it. We watched the Anime first, which to my suprise I enjoyed. I'm not a big fan of Anime but It was a good film and this is a fun book."
2,Movie is SO MUCH better,"I wish I would've read the book first before I seen the movie..maybe that would've changed my opinion of the book but still.....I say see the movie instead of reading the book...The book gets 2 stars because I LOVE HOWL'S CHARACTER. But Sophie was annoying at times. I wish Michael was Marco, the kid in the movie, he was much cuter. The book is boring and wasn't as creative as the movie AND the ending of the book was HORRIBLE. Everything was rushed. The author like crammed up everything..it was like she was sick of the book and just ended it because she gave up on it or something...it was the worst ending ever, it wasn't even worth reading like...so abrupt. The whole book was all suddenly concluded in like 1 chapter."
2,Hard to get through if you're an adult,"Some of this author's early books are entertaining even for adults in the same way Harry Potter is, but this book is very difficult to get through because of the nonsensical plot. You can feel the author trying very hard to make something out of an idea, and spinning out prose just for the sake of making a longer book, but it is a very very thin story. It was much better conceptualized as an animated film by Miyazaki (Studio Ghibli), also of the same title, because the film made much better use of the characters."
3,Not a master,"I like to know what my 10 year old son is reading these days. His choices are the Harry Potter books, Captain Underpants, etc. This book looks on the surface to be a good choice for him, but once I got into the story it is more like a twisted romance novel for pre-teens. The sentences are short and choppy with oddly placed words. Story-wise, it is not bad, but CS Lewis or JK Rowling it is not."
1,kids books shouldn't be lame,"I enjoy reading fantasy fiction, including titles primarily intended for children, and I applaud the imagination of the author. A full-sized castle that roams the hillsides is a fascinating invention. The author's inclusion of some side trips into modern-day Wales, set in a Welsh-speaking household, were also interesting and commendable.Nevertheless, the poor character development, flimsy story lines, and impausible (if predictable) plot devices made Howl's Moving Castle a painful read at times. The book seems as though it was published before the final draft was ready, and it could use at least one more thorough edit. As a reader, I got the sense that the author felt that this was ""only a kid's book"" and that a feeble story with plenty of flash would be just fine.I would like to see Ms Jones match up her strong imagination with a more proven and compelling writer. Such a team could develop some truly wonderful storytelling!"
4,"Very good read, but nothing like the movie.","Absolutely loved the book, but if you are looking for it to be like the movie, you will be disappointed."
5,Good read,The story is a fun read for adults and kids. It is different enough from the movie that you will not know what to expect after having seen the animated film. I loved both the movie and the book.
5,Enchanting,"Wonderful book with a richly drawn world, charming characters, and an engrossing plot that's appealing to adults and young adults alike. This is a real masterpiece that only gets better on rereading."
4,Looking forward to reading this to my son when he is older,My son loved the Miyazaki movie of Howl's Moving Castle. I am looking forward to reading this to him when he is older a couple of years older. It's a great book.
5,Adventure and Romance,"The perfect combination of two elements that can make a persons imagination sore. Sophie, the main character is well writen and very well liked. She is sweet, and stubborn, always thinking that she will get nothing better becuase of her status in life, until one fateful day a powerful spell is cast on her by the Witch of the Waste.I really enjoyed this book, even though I didn't pick it up until after the movie had been released. I have to say it is quite enjoyable. The characters are well writen. I plan to read this someday to my child, and I hope the power of Diana Wynne Jones words can take him/her to a fantastic world of witch craft, adventure and romance."
5,Diana Wynne Jones IS A GODDESS!,"Diana Wynne Jones is my absolute, undyingly favorite author! Howl's Moving Castle is the first book I ever read by her, and it changed my whole perspective on fantasy. Howl's Moving Castle remains my favorite book, though it is closely followed by A Tale Of Time City and Aunt Maria.EVERYBODY, READ ALL OF HER BOOKS! EACH AND EVERY ONE OF THEM ARE FANTASTIC! I MEAN IT! READ ALL OF THEM!"
4,** A REAL fantasy book **,"I am a reader of many fantasy books, and Diana Wynne Jones is one of my favorites because of her mysterious aspect of fantasy. One of the things I found so interesting and refreshing in this lovely tale, was the strong sense of irony I felt for the main character. All throughtout the book, she hobbles and cackles as an old woman of 70 or so. What a brilliant and hillarious idea! This book is definitely a fantasy classic."
3,Howl's Moving Castle,"Sophie is oldest child in her family and this means that she is doomed to a crummy fate. The superstition comes alive when she is turned into an old woman by the jealous witch of the waste. She runs from her little hat shop to find her fortune, but she is now old and doesn't get around so well. She meets the mysterious and vain wizard, Howl. She becomes a member of his strange little household in a castle that is enchanted and moves around the countryside.The book was amusing at times and at others frustrating because it was full of details, but the story never really went anywhere. Jealousy and romance in a fantasy setting are the prevailing thems. Howl is the typical pretty boy that no one ever wants to get involved with. All of the characters were completely unique and well thought out. The ending was satisfying but sudden. The book was entertaining at times, but was difficult to get fully interested in."
3,almost the same...,"I watched the movie first and was later prompted to read the novel since the movie had unanswered questions here and there. To my surprise, there are a lot of parts in the book that were not in the movie. The book did not mention a war and Sophie was more bitter. However, it did clear up any misunderstandinds from the movie which is why I bought the book in the first place."
4,Quite Magical,"_Howl's Moving Castle_ is a whimsical and funny fantasy about the adventures of Sophie, a girl who is transformed into an old woman by the wicked Witch of the Waste. She goes to the magical moving castle of Howl, a wizard rumored to eat the hearts of young girls, to be a cleaning woman. There is much misunderstanding, tantrum-throwing, seven league traveling, and wizardry; Howl and Sophie are endearing protagonists, and Calcifer the fire demon is my favorite sulky supporting character."
4,Lovely.,Slow at first but picks up towards the end. It was a good read and I would definitely suggest it. It is an adventure!
5,Wonderful,I love this story. I didn't want to put it down. Can't wait to read more. Howl and Sophie are wonderful characters what are they going to do next?
5,This was great,Howls moving castle is a must read I loved it and was more that I expected it to be. If you're thinking about getting it the DEFINITELY BUY IT and it came in amazing condition as well.
5,Good book to read,I decided to read the book since I love the movie and once I started reading I couldn't put it down.
5,Another great book by Diana Wynne Jones!!!,This book is both funny and intelligent a combination not often found of late in fantasy novels.
5,"A ""moving"" experience!","Being a school librarian I am always looking for something I can recommend to the kids...I will enjoy very much recommending this book. I read 2-3 pbs a week so rarely consider rereading a book, yet Howl's Moving Castle is making me think this is one to reread. I enjoyed the characters, the plot, and the magic! I obviously need to read more of Jones' books."
5,Loved it.,My daughter loves this movie and has probably watched it 50 times. She loved being able to finally read the book.
4,A favorite book of mine...,"I really enjoyed reading this the first time and since then have enjoyed reading it over and over. It makes for a very entertaining read and most of the characters (Calcifer was my fave!) are very interesting and easily understood; which is a must for a good book. The book was funny, the plot flowed well and, for the most part, was easy to follow. It is certainly not a masterpiece (not a Bronte or a Shakespeare), and it does have flaws (like an occasionally confusing plot and a rather abrupt ending), but it is a book that makes one laugh and makes one care about the characters, which keeps one coming back for re-reads. The open ending also allows for the reader to make his/her own assumptions about what will happen to Sophie/Howl.Even though this may not be the best book you'll ever read, it is a highly entertaining piece of light reading for in between weightier works. I recommend buying a copy and keeping it in your desk drawer next to your best pen."
5,This book was excellent!,"There was only one thing about this book that I thought could improve. It took a little while until the story got tremendously suspenseful. Bul it was never the slightes bit boring. I highly disagree about the age group of this book. This book is the kind of book that can be highly interesting to both kids and adults. I would recomend this book to everyone. Diana's books are so much better than ""Harry Potter"". This was probbably the most suspensful book I'v ever read! I hope she makes another sequel besides ""Castle in the air"". (that book was even better!)"
5,I Simply Loved It !,"THis is one of my favorite books! This is one of Dianna Wynne Jones' best. I mean it. The characters are hilariously funny. I love Sophie and Howl. Howl's tantrums, and the way he is so not like an ordinary wizard. Sophie is definitely not a failure. She is great! Calcifer is loveable. With his blue hair, and Howl's coal lump of a heart. This book was just amazing. I've read it four times, and the characters and plot never bore me!"
5,Howls moving castle,WOW WOW WOW WOW WOW WOW WOW!!!!!!! This book was so amazing. I saw the cartoon movie and left just being confused and disappointed. This book answered my questions and much more. I love the story and the land and the castle. What an ingenious place. Highly recommended for readers who love magic and that sort of thing.
3,Has not read it yet,"Bought this for my teen, she hasn't read it yet. Not sure if it is just not interesting enough, or she's too busy?? Anyway, it did solve my issue with not having another gift to give for xmas."
3,Book of Howl's Moving Castle,"Love the story...but the condition of the book isn't very good. The speed at which I received my order was fast. The book looked good on the outside, but I have to be very gentle and careful when I open in because the inside binding is cracking and ready to fall apart."
4,"A charming, wry fairy tale","As satisfying as a fairy tale, but with a bit of an ironic take. The romance is satisfying yet deepened with the wisdom of an older character's insight."
5,Surprisingly better than the movie.,"To be honest, when I heard there was a book that Miyazaki's film was based on, I was surprised. I thought the book itself would be no where near as good as the movie. After reading it, I really have to say that the book surpasses the movie by a long shot. It is written extremely well, it is easy to keep up with and really holds your attention. The characters are a bit different in the book compared to the movie, and you also get so much to each of the characters.If you loved or even liked the Miyazaki production, I would highly recommend reading this book! If you haven't watched the movie but would like to, I'd suggest watching the movie first. Even if you read it first, the story lines are relatively different, as well as some of the characters, so you'll be surprised to see how they are different, especially if you watched the movie first. :)"
5,Howl's Moving Castle (Howl's Castle),I loved reading Howl's Moving Castle.(Howl's Castle) I couldn't put it down and read it in one day. Easy read but kept you interested.
5,Hey!? What happened to the Kindle edition?,"It would appear the Kindle version of this book is no more:( I am a bit miffed to say the least! I had pulled the Kindle sample of this book before Thanksgiving, but it now has vanished! I finally got around to reading it this week, got to the end of the sample, clicked on the link to buy the book; then was told that it no longer exists!?I am not sure what to do, I started reading it in a digital format, but now nobody has it (not even Barnes and Noble). Am I supposed to move backward and buy the paperback?Aside from that, from what I was able to read, it is an enchanting story that helps clarify many points that were missing from Hayao Miyazaki's interpretation of the work. I wish I could say more, but I am unable to finish reading this unless I feel like toting around an actual book; a ""novel"" idea in this world of digital readers. I will check back later in hopes that it reappears."
5,better than the movie,"the first time i heard of ""Howl's Moving Castle"" was when i went to go see it at the movies with some friends. i LOVED the movie. but in the credits it said ""based on a book"" so i bought the book. WOW. it's like getting a whole new story. this book has so much to offer readers young and old alike. it's fun and full of whimsical adventure. i highly reccomend this book."
5,Howls moving castle,"I read this book when I was 10 and loved it,after seeing the movie I was curious to see if the book was as wOnderful as I remembered it. It was so fun to reread it as an adult and I am so excited for when my daughter is old enough and I can pass it on to her."
3,"Great book, bad digital version","I'm about halfway through this book, and I love the story. For the content, I would definitely give 4 or 5 stars. However, I feel that people should be aware that there are multiple errors and typos with this Kindle version. I for is, Moth for Both, etc. They don't make the book unreadable, but there have been a few times when I had to reread a sentence to try to figure out what it should say because a typo was making it really confusing."
5,NOT OVERPRICED!...,"Unlike all the other dragon ash cds/eps on amazon this is at a reasonaable price.I enjoyed this single greatly.I own the cd ""Lilly Of Da Valley"" and the song ""Deep Impact"" is on it.That is the best song on that cd and the best song on the single.The Dj Krush remix is great also.The rest of the album is good to but the only reason i would suggest buying this is the origanel and the dj krush remix of ""Deep Impact"".Dragon Ash Is Great!!"
3,3 out of 5,"This is one of dragon ash's newest singles but isn't all that good. Deep impact gets kind of agravating but i enjoyed the remix, this cd was DA's change from the good old stuff to the new [junk]. If you are going to buy one of their cd's get mustang or buzz songs."
3,It's OK,The chair is not as sturdy as the ad implies. No mention was made of free gift wrap at the time of purchase nor was a color choice offered although it said there were three colors available. The can holders appear fragile.
3,Portable stadium seat,The seat comes with cup holders however they are not attached. They have a screw to attach and are basically cheap made. Not much padding in the seat and the inflatable seat cushion is a joke. For the price paid I would have a hard time recommending this chair to anyone. Only recommended for an occasional user.
3,Decent chair.,"It definitely saves my butt from cold bleachers, but it doesn't live up to the ""heavy-duty"" title. I'm 6'3"" & about 210lbs & it doesn't seem to have a limit on how far it will lean back."
3,Stadium Chair Review,"Stadium Chair was okay, but one of the support straps broke on first use. Seat padding inadequate, not enough cushion. Have seen better models at sport chalet."
2,Not enough info in specifications,Nowhere was it available the weight limit on this item. For heavier people this is important!! Weight limit is only 225lbs. Wish that marketing would display this in specifications so consumers would know what they were buying.
2,poor seat design,The hook that secures the seat to the bench moves.It is not attached to the frame but to soft farbic.You can not lean back too far or you fall over.The old design had the hook attached to the metal frame.
3,Product = great - Shipping = Not so much,The product is everything that was claimed but I was told that I would received this item in time for Mother's Day and that didn't happen. I was very disappointed about this. When I inquired about it I was told that it was Fed Express that was the problem and I was told they would follow up with me as to what the problem was. I never heard from them. I give them 1 star for their customer service.
3,Stadium Seat,We use this as an extra seat for friends at events. Could be a little more stable in it's attachment to the bench. We use extra bungy cords as people often feel like their going over backwards when they lean back. Cup holders are handy as well as the storage pouches. For the price it's an ok seat. If you want to feel super secure while seated this would NOT be the chair for you.
4,Oasis sport seat,"The chair is comfortable and gives me the back support I need. The cupholders are a little shallow and ackward when carrying the chair. The ""bonus"" key chain is not really a bonus. I also found the shipping costs to be on the high side."
1,Not a good vendor to work with!,I order the exact chair and color in the picture. Upon receiving my chair it was red and black in color. I attempted to contact the vendor about sending the wrong chair. The gave every excuse under the sun not to correct the problem and satisfy the customer. What a terrible experience!
3,"Sits too far back, and leans too far back","The two hooks that hold the chair to the bleacher are too far forward such that the chair is too far back and interfers with the person behind. The two straps also aren't tight enough, so that the back tips back beyond vertical (I saw others with seats that had straps that adjusted). The front is close to being flush with the edge of the bleacher as shown, and so for at least the bleacher I was sitting on (Austin Circuit of the Americas, it extends into the legs of the person behind. I think I'll drill out the rivets and bolt the connectors back on several inches back. I can also sew the straps to be shorter."
5,Gift,I buy my mom a chair so she would stop taking mine. lol. Actually my boys bought her this chair for wen she goes to support them at games.
1,DID NOT BUY THIS,zero tipping heavy duty sport oasisdid not buy this prduct donot bill me for it how did it get on my account ////// darwin hall
3,Problems with the gift wrapping,"It was nice that this gift came gift wrapped for free; however, someone was not thinking before it was gift wrapped because he/she put an invoice inside the gift-wrapped box. If it is a gift, we don't want to share the price with the gift recipient."
2,Stadium seat,It is a nice seat but I think it is a little overpriced.I found one similar to it for 14.00 at Wal-Mart
2,Misleading information,I've been trying to find an extra-large stadium seat for an overweight person. Most show 19 inches as the seat size so I was very happy to find this one which said it was 22 inches. When it arrived I realized that it was the same size as one I already own. The 22 inches apparently included the arm rests. Now I'm stuck with having to send it back.
3,Disappointment,"On the plus side, this chair has lots of pockets to store items and the cup holders are functional. The shoulder strap makes carrying easy and the clamps secure the seat to the stadium bench.On the negative side, the seat bottom is only marginally comfortable and the angle of the back is uncomfortable and cannot be adjusted. The arm rests are woefully inadequate other than to hold the cup holders. They are small, short, and narrow, too far back to comfortably rest ones arms on them.If the seat back was adjustable and the arm rests wider and more forward, this might be a great chair. As is, it is merely adequate."
5,THE ULTIMATE REFERENCE,The ultimate reference and final word on the vanished civilization of Iraq. It encompass all the aspects from economy and culture to history and religion. It s a universal mini-encylopedia in all its splendors!
5,great book,"Very educational. if you are as interested in ancient civilizations as i am, this is worth getting. glad i bought this. Kind of a boring read but very interesting."
3,no pictures,"This book is one of the best that I have read about ancient Mesopotamia, but is so badly illustrated."
3,Mayra Calvani -- TCM REVIEWS,"""Sleep peacefully my princess..."" Thus begins this sweet, illustrated poem of a father who night after night fights the monsters in her small daughter's darkest imagination. On his noble steed, he is her brave knight in shining armor, ready to destroy the beasts and bogeymen that disturb her quiet dreams.""I'll ride my noble steed to battle,/My sword and shield held high./I'll chase away those demons, On my winged horse in the sky.""This is the perfect kind of story for a father to read to his daughter before going to bed. Though the illustrations are somewhat bland, and at instances fail to bring to life the beauty of the poem, most children will enjoy this book cuddled up in bed at night.Early readers may read this one on their own, though an adult should read it the first time in order to explain that the ugly monsters coming out of the closet only exist in the girl's imagination."
5,Great Action!!,My husband and I started watching The Ultimate Fighter at Season 6 so we had to come back and watch them all.
5,"Reality tv show works out it's kinks. Still cool, esp. the end.","I like reality tv contest shows, and I like ultimate fighting, so this is a good mix for me. What's more, the payoff for watching the season (that is, the UFC final match) had a fight between two of the contestants that seemed truly historical."
3,Haven't Recieved Yet,The item was susposed to be here between these particular dates & we haven't recieved the item yet & it is 3 days past the due date. Hoping we still get this product.
2,poor quality,"I returned this once because the 2nd DVD wouldn't play. Got the new one and it wouldn't play again. Neither would DVD number 4. Good season, too bad I couldn't see the whole thing."
1,Terrible,Just terrible and not worth the money. The fights are horrible and the fighters have very little skill. Puchase PRIDE instead where the best fighters in the WORLD come to fight.That Matt guy who wrote the first review has no clue what he's talking about. PRIDE is the biggest stage for MMA not UFC. That is a fact.
5,TUF 1,"Overall this might be the best reality tv show of all time, the ufc is what it is today because of this show. It shows the struggles fighters go through and the demons that some have to stop from taking over them, i have seen all the series and i still cant get up from the tv until i watch the entire season again!"
4,Missing The Maples,"David Maples helmed this show from the beginning, and gave the subtle mix of tragic comedy a real bite. His wife, Holly Maples added a lovely grace note with her relationship to Mary in the Marshals office.The producers have made a terrible error in removing the Maples from the mix, and after watching two of the new season shows, I'm beginning to have my doubts the show will survive their removal.brendan"
1,a great show ruined,"Why do people who produce tv shows do this time and time again? They take a near-perfect show, a fan favorite, and just HAVE to overhaul it to give it a fresh look. Why? In Plain Sight was wonderful the way it was for the first 2 seasons. There were so many cast deletions and additions in season 3 it hardly looked like the same program. A word of advice to the show's producers. If it ain't broke, don't fix it!! Bring back Eleanor, Raph, Jinx, Brandi, and Peter. Stop making Marshall into Mary's lapdog. Give us Stan the way he was. Get the show back on track. And no offense, but get rid of Allison Janney. It was like she was added to the show because she had a couple of free weeks between other acting gigs. Her character certainly didn't add anything to the season. Neither did the actress who played the accountant. The poor woman wasn't given much of a part to work with."
2,Screw up a good thing,I have now seen the first two dvd's of season three. It's not good. I gave the first two years five stars. It now gets two. Even the music is bad. The theme over the end credits has changed to a fluffy piece.I see the show has been canceled. No wonder.
1,"Been there, done that....",Imagine my surprise when I picked up _The End to Privacy_ only to find that it offers nearly the identical thesis contained in my book _The Culture of Surveillance_ (St.Martin's Press) published more than two years ago. One would think that Professor Whitaker would have at least reviewed the literature before penning this obviously redundant book.
5,Simply the best,"I think Reg Whitaker did an excellent job in descriving how our privacy can be infringed on a daily basis. The best part is the second chapter, where he explains that the digitalization and the creation of databases are the main 2 causes of ""the end of privacy"""
3,Prof Needs Some Schooling,"The book was very thought provoking. However, there seemed to be some factual errors when discussing intelligence-related topics that he might have cleared up with a little homework. It amazes me that so little is actually being published on this topic when it will dramatically (and irrevocably?) alter our own sense of who we are and how we fit into society."
5,Gripping and disturbing,"I could not put this book down. I read it in two days. Deeply disturbing and very sad. Harley, a 19 year old boy is left to care for his three sisters after his mother is sent to prison for shooting her husband (so we are led to believe). It is strange to see that Harley ends up taking the blame for shooting Callie just like his mother ends up taking the blame for shooting her husband. Tawni (the author) is very good at describing her characters and making you feel as though you know them personally. I would definitely recommend this book to fellow readers but would caution them around the contents."
4,good start slow middle killer end,I felt like being on a runaway train the first hundred pages. Pieces of things kept popping up and you know they will be back to haunt you. A stunning debut for Ms. O'Dell.
3,Not for young readers...,"I have worked with Emotionally Disturbed teenagers as an English teacher for 10 years. In that time, I have heard stories of abuse that are so disturbing, I thought nothing could shock me. This book shocked me. I didn't know what I was getting into when I picked it up. The front and back covers are very misleading. I feel, after reading this, that I know now exactly what Holden Caulfield was trying to protect kids from. Many times during reading this book I thought of putting it down and not finishing it. It was written in such a way, though, that I felt compelled to finish it. In fact, I read the last 100 pages in one sitting. I am warning the faint of heart, the weak of stomach, the prudes out there who don't want to hear about things that make people uncomfortable: Don't buy this book. For the rest of you, be open-minded, read it, and think about ways to make this world a better, safer place for those who need it most."
3,I liked it and I was disappointed at the same time...,"I like dysfunctional family books (lots of experience growing up! - :), especially with the psychology aspect of it thrown in. This book was right up my alley and I rushed out to buy it. Read it fast, too. It had a lot of potential, but was murky in the character development, I thought. I had trouble bonding with any of the characters (the only one I liked was the 6 year old little sister). I think that would have helped me care about the outcome of the characters more. The incest storyline seemed thrown in to me and could have either been left out or written to make more sense. All-in-all it was an interesting read but could have been a lot more than that."
3,WoW!,"Kudos to Tawni O'Dell! This was a touching,funny,deep read. I wanted to hug certain characters all through out the book! Your hear will go out to the eldest child and all he has and will endure as he takes on the role of the father and mother in his household. This is a great vacation or rainy day read for all."
4,An interesting read...,"I enjoyed Back Roads, and while I was reading it, I found I could barely put it down. Tawni O'Dell tells the story of a troubled young man forced to be an adult too soon. Though disturbed by his violent fantasies (which contributed to the suspense of the book), I found I like the character and even laughed out loud at some of his views of the world. (Asking to the talk to the bank, for instance, was very clever.) I don't know if this book will stand out in my mind over the next few months or years, but it definitely kept me enthralled while I was reading it."
2,Unrealistic depiction of Western PA...,"I bought this book for two main reasons: first, Oprah recommended it and I have thoroughly enjoyed the other books on her list; second, I am from the same area of Western Pennsylvania as the main character Harley and the author are from. In fact, I live only a few miles from the town of Black Lick, PA and the kids from Black Lick went to the same high school as me.I thought this was a disgusting book. I was very upset with the way it portrayed Western PA. I do not know anyone whose life has been at all like Harley's. I think Ms. O'Dell is giving a bad impression of this area through all the talk of murder, incest, adultery, etc. She is obviously enjoying her new life in Illinois! If she feels that Western PA is such a ""beautiful"" place (as noted on the back cover) then next time I hope she writes a ""beautiful"" story!"
3,Grab your prozac,"This is the most depressing book I have ever read. Yes, it is a story that keeps you turning the pages, but each chapter brings a new sense of sadness and tragedy. If your life is filled with happiness and wealth and you need a reality pill to show you how other people live, then this book is for you. But if you are looking for a reason to be happy each morning, skip this book. I am avoiding all of the Oprah books from now on."
3,Good'n'Bad.,"This story is confusing. It's good and interesting, but very sad. I didn't like the way Harley think, always aggressive. The beautiful things turns to ugliness. The end wasn't enough, I want to know about Harley till he die. So, read it but don't finish it."
1,Stop!! Don't waste your time on this book.,"I was terribly disappointed with this book. I read it because I have lived in western PA all my life. There are very few local references, and they aren't really part of the story at all. This book could be set anywhere. It was full of depressed, violent, angry people who are overlooked and manipulated by ""the system"". The characters in this book are very shallow, and their decisions are predictable. I enjoy a wide variety of books, but this one is one I wish I hadn't wasted my time on. This is the first ""Oprah's picks"" book I have read and I doubt that I will read anything she recommends in the future."
2,Disappointing,"When I first started the book I had high expectations, I thought the story would be interesting. However the characters were poorly developed and uninteresting. The book was very slow, in the end I didn't care what happened to the characters. I put the book away when I was only half the way through. This was the first book I have read from Oprah's book club and it was a disappointing experience........doesn't she read the books she recommends?"
1,One of the worst books I have ever read.,"This is undoubtedly one of the worst books that I have ever read. I seldom read fiction and this is a good example of why I choose not to. If it wasn't for the F word there wouldn't have been a plot. In fact I never did understand what message the story was trying to get across. I am a 70 year old male and let me assure readers that the male personna was not captured....at least not for my generation. I am a former steel mill worker and a former combat Marine. I point this out to show that I am not a prude. I have heard it all, but in my opion this book is offensive to men. Real men."
1,waste of time,"Don't waste your time ready this book. Harley is just as whiny as his sisters. The author used this book to make an excuse to throw in some sibling incest, masturbation and gender violence into the pages. Harley hates his sisters so much that he constantly imagines killing them. At the end, he ""redeems"" himself by taking the blame for one of their actions. Oh please. The characters are unbelieveable and very unlikeable. Then, the author puts in a discussion page at the end of her book asking why Harley did this or why his sisters did that. As if this book were to replace classics such as ""The Catcher in the Rye"" in the classroom. Get over yourself, Tawni O'Dell."
2,Different perceptions,"Funny? An enjoyable read? Not hardly. Engrossing? Disturbing? I think these adjectives are more appropriate. This story of 19 year old Harley who is suddenly the head of a family caught in the middle of murder, incest, poverty and dysfunction (to put it midly) is dark and riveting. As other customer reviewers have indicated, Back Roads is a difficult book to put down. O'Dell does an excellent job of writing in a male first person voice - something that I think takes a particular talent for writers depicting characters of the opposite sex. However, the continuous trauma suffered by the children in this family only results in more pain. Just when you think there is a flicker of normalcy for them, the candle once again blows out. As the end of the novel drew near, I was looking forward to some redemption, some promise, some hope - and found none. O'Dell has an eviable way with words in her descriptions and dialogue. I look forward to giving her next effort another try."
4,Emotionally Haunting,"This is the story of 19 year old Harley ... an average lower-middle class child of parents who married in the seventies because his Mom was pregnant with him. His parents did the ""right thing"", then had three more children, all girls. They lived their lives as best they could ... with little money, a small tar-paper shack they rented, and lots of abuse.Fast forward to when Mom ends up in jail for life for the shooting death of Dad and Harley is left to raise his three younger sisters. What a struggle.I was immediately drawn to the story line as well as the characters in it. I was also very disturbed by it. I have by no means been sheltered, but this story still made my soul hurt.Many reviewers said it was ""funny""... perhaps I don't have a good sense of humor because I didn't find anything about this story funny. I found it very sad, very memorable, and very worth reading."
5,Back Roads is gripping!,"I read this amidst the chaos and activity of a household with young children, and miraculously managed to finish it in two sittings. Back Roads is not just a gripping story, it is also beautifully written, and the character is completely engaging. The author has captured an endearingly honest (and humorous) voice in Harley. To put the book down felt like hanging up on a friend in need, so I had to keep reading. I look forward to more works by the author."
2,Very disturbing book,"There was a comment by Margot Livesey on the back of this book that said '. . . This is a fast, furious, funny novel.' There were a few parts of this book that were on the VERY dark side of humor, but the subject matter was so far from humorous that it left me feeling ill.Was it well written? I guess. Did it keep my interest? Like a train wreck might keep my interest. I would never recommend this book to anyone and wish I had never read it."
3,"Sad, complex","My sister in law lent this book to me - I had never heard of it. From page one I was swept up in the characters and the story - but it's not to say that I liked what I was reading - I just couldn't put it down. The characters and the story were very complex - which kept me reading. The story is very sad, and at times hard to follow. The people in this book made me feel remarkably ""normal"" and very sheltered - I was shocked many times as I read along.The story is disturbing, but if you can stomach it, it's worth the read. It takes you to a darker side of humanity - and the stuggles that go with that side.Consuming, but heartbreaking. Read if you can handle 200 pages of pure sadness."
3,Not bad for an Oprah pick.,"When I saw that this was an Oprah pick, I almost didn't bother. I figured it was just another down-in-the-dumps, dusty little nowhere town, people struggling-to-get-by book. And I was right. But it also had another element to it. There was just something about Harley, working two jobs to support his three younger sisters after their mother was convicted of murdering their father, and the ensuing events. There's no one thing that held my attention, but I'm glad I took the time to read it."
1,Back Roads,"This was one of the worst books I've ever read. I kept waiting for something to happen. I wadded through the problems and woes. It was depressing to say the least. I never saw anything ""funny"" in this book. It was so sad and depressing and the conclusion just hung in mid air. I was so disappointed. I picked it up four times before I finally finished it. I would not recommend this book to anyone. When I read a good book I don't want it to end. I wanted this book to end many times while I was reading it. d"
2,Buyer Beware,"Backroads may be an o.k. book but buyer beware! Shrouded inOprah's stamp of approval, one thinks ones in for what the cover &copy advertise. By calling the book ""hilarious"",""sexy"" and ""funny"" this author is done such adisservice. I thought it would be the dysfunctional lovable bumblingof an Anne Tyler or the complex country flavor of a Carsen McCullers,like one is lead to believe. In truth, its the intensifying of someSpringer characters with the polish of seriousness, smartly decryingone's parents and dallying with an ever-radiating incest. Doessemi-incestuous content automatically get catapulted to literaturethese days? Book isn't so bad but so misadvertised and hyped I wasangry enough to write this review. I feel I just got had at the usedcar dealership. While the main character is familiar and sympatheticin his desparate grind, I am not passing this book on to anyone I knowto read. It is not funny, sexy or hilarious."
3,"depression, dysfuntion, incest, violence......","This is a story of a truly dysfunctional family. A mother in prison for the murder of a husband that physically and emotionally abused her children. Four children left in the world to fend for themselves. The effects of the abuse lingered on long after the murder of the father. Harley is the oldest, left to care for his three sisters. In addition to the normal ""troubles"" of a nineteen year old boy, Harley had to deal with poverty, thoughts of violence, poverty and mental illness. Two of the sisters have problems and secrets of their own. The youngest is the only light in Harley's world. This story is depressing throughout. You would hope for a light at the end of the tunnel for this family but there is only more of the same. It has a dissapointing ending that leaves you with a lingering feeling of sadness. It was an interesting book but I found the foul language and violence unsettling. It could have been written well without it."
5,A great story teller,"This is one of the best books I have read in a long time. The story is wonderful, but the best part is the story-teller. Tawni O'Dell is a straight-forward writer, and spins a wonderful tale of angst, anger, frustration, hope, and human resilience. I read the entire book in 24 hours. I couldn't put it down! It is a must read."
5,Love this book!,"This was everything a good book should be. I didn't want to go to bed because I wanted to keep reading, laughed out loud, reread passages because they were so unique, and found it very fulfilling overall. Don't pass this one by."
5,Oprah's redeemed herself!,"After Daughter of Fortune, (HATED IT) I was hesitant to follow Oprah's advice on another book. I am glad I did. Back Roads is a wonderful book, full of thought-provoking images and detail. It is not a book you'd want to pick to pass time because you'll read it in a day... it's a page turner. I laughed at one page and cried at the next. It causes you to pause and wonder what you'd do in Harley's situation and then thank God you're not in Harley's situation. Sadly, 'Harley's situation' happens to more kids than we'd like to admit."
2,Fast read BUT watch out for ...........,"I found this book hard to put down, BUT it truly disturbed me. I read it w/in 3 days. Maybe I just needed to get through it and I was searching for a light at the end of the tunnel. But Oprah has done it again. She has found something disturbing to that will shake the human core. The synopsis is misleading. Go to your local bookstore, read the first chapter, and get a cup of coffee or tea before you buy the book. I gave it a 2 because the author has potential but the context was WAY to disturbing and we don't need that.*** Warning *** She's a great writer but the context is disturbing. Don't we get enough of this on the 5 o'clock news?"
3,Well-written but the back cover lied,"This book was well-written, but I was completely mislead by the back cover. It implied that it was a kind of fun-loving story of struggle and ""bumbling heroics"". Uh-uh. It was funny at times, but also dark, sad, shocking, and upsetting. Do not think this is a happy book. It is different, but also very traumatizing, even to those of us who have read loads of very traumatizing material. I'm looking forward to her next book."
2,Completely Strains credibility...,"As other reviewers have mentioned this story starts out strongly but falters as it progresses. The author is able to convincingly develop the character of Harley and he has a distinctive voice.I enjoyed the initial parts of the book, but the subsequent developments were completely unbelievable. I'm unwilling to accept the reality of a story that has two members of one family separately committing murders. The plot does not tie together and is ultimately very disappointing."
2,just didn't like the story,"I thought that the writing was good, but the story was awful. It was just an absolutely depressing story about someone whose had EVERYTHING go wrong it his life. The way it ended was annoying and extremely depressing. It was not ""funny"" at all as the back cover boasts."
2,wrenching,"This book, while vivid and well-written, was just too brutal for my taste. I am usually a fan of dark fiction, but this was simply too devastating. Tawni O'Dell is talented, all right, because she took me straight to the characters' guts, and I didn't want to stay."
3,"Good, not great","This was interesting, but having worked in social services for years, I thought this was quite inaccurate and just not believable."
3,Hmm...,"The characters in this book remind me of some charachters that were in the movie ""Deliverance"" The writing is good but sometimes hard to follow when the main character Harley has flashbacks of bits and pieces of childhood memories. It was hard for me to figure out if there was child abuse the author gives you hints but it's very vague. There are some disturbing themes in this book which doesn't surprise me given the title,setting and family history. The ending could have been better."
4,A Great Book,I enjoyed reading the book all the way through. A young boy is left to take care of his 3 younger sisters.They came from an unhappy home where the mother finally kills the father and she is sent to prison.Books that touch the emotions are my favorite and this one does that very well. It is a great story and you will love it.
2,A reader,If you feel that you must read it because it appears on Oprah's list then at least do yourself the favor of purchasing the paperback. This is not a book to keep. I'll give it 2 stars because it passed the time and kept me reading but it's not a book that I would bother recommending to others.
5,!...Excellent...!,"This book just left me in complete Awe. I counldn't put it down for the life of me. Yes, indeed it's quite the page turner. This book is very well executed. Honestly, *one* of the greatest books I've ever read, thus, I felt the need to comment on it. :)And *ahem* this book *is* ""funny"" and may be described as such by the ""professional reveiwers"". For, in my *OWN* opionion, I do not belive they were referring to the ""themes portrayed""...but to Harely, the main character, for his **wittyness, and sharpness.**I certainly do not, believe that the reveiwers were sitting there saying...""....family abused..haha..father killed....hahaha..that's funny""If you got that impression. I'm very sorry that you missed some very great moments from Harely."
4,Farfetched & Depressing ... but REALLY Good,"I had to laugh when one of the other reveiwers wrote, ""... ignore Oprah's abused-protagonist-of-the-month-club."" All the books I've read on her list are exactly that! While it is true I've never read so many heart wrenching books before refering to her list, I've also never read so many well written books.Backroads is shocking. It is hard to put down. Sure it is depressing, but it is great reading!"
3,Backroads--A Book of Interest,"Life is hard at best, but especially for a boy left to raise his sisters while his mother is in jail. A surprise ending, which I won't divulge at this time. But I would say it is a satisfactory ending. I actually give it 3-1/2 stars, and highly recommend it."
5,Gripping,"This book has a lot of depth to it. I really don't think it was intended for 'light reading' at all. I could not put it down, despite the harsh plot. The main character, Harley, is forced to grow up & take care of his three sisters when his mother is in jail for shooting his father. There are so many stories that unwind & secrets that unlock in this book. This book is about reality & its cruelty. I do not recommend it for the weak-stomached."
5,up with the best,"This book is fabulous. My favorites are She's Come Undone and White Oleander, if you liked them you will love Back roads, it is a touching yet disturbing story that keeps you hungry for more!"
2,"""Back Roads"" Book Jacket Misleading","This book intrigued me when I first bought it because of the subject matter: a young man trying to deal with raising his three younger sisters in the absence of their parents. But as I read further, I found the content of the book to degenerate and become highly disturbing, especially the incest theme that threads through the novel. When the father is posthumously found not guilty of incest with his daughter, the reader discovers (and has seen all along) that Harley and Amber have an incestuous attraction or need, and this turned my stomach. I was particularly repulsed to discover Harley and Amber having sex after Harley discovers Callie's dead body--and to top it off, he knows his sister is the culprit. Is this at all realistic? I am interested to know whether sibling incest is a characteristic of parental abuse--I highly doubt it. I found the story outrageous and overly dysfunctional. This book sickens rather than intrigues."
2,Disappointed,"I was not impressed with Tawni Odells syle of writing, I did not like how she introducted the characters. You read the first few pages without even knowing WHO it was you were reading about. She did that as well with the sisters. Not one of my favorite Oprah books. The second 1/2 of the book was better than the first 1/2.....they story kept you going in the end, but getting there was not done as well as I would have liked. Hope Tawni does better with her next book."
1,Back Roads,"I am surprised at the number of very positive reviews. The subject matter was believable, but I thought the characters were only stereotypes and had little depth. I also found the style ""cutesy"" in parts, and I thought that the writing needed much better editing.I would not recommend this book."
1,Last three chapters missing.,I ordered this book as a gift to my sister. I called her and asked how she liked it and unfortunately the last three chapters were missing! She told me not to worry about it but I paid for the whole book and either send her another one or refund my money. Thanks.
1,A Painted House - John Grisham,"This was not the usual exciting work of Grisham. It lacked that grasping, take hold, affect his books always have had. Book as a whole was very slow going and and had a lack luster ending."
4,Very Pleased and Suprised,"Back Roads is truly a journey into raw, disconnected emotion fueled by love and the desire to survive. I am familiar with small town PA, having lived there four years..the characters are true, sound and developed. I highly recommend this book."
4,Oprah did it again,"I read this book in 3 days! The title character, Harley takes you through his life in the backwoods of Pennsylvania. It's a little explicit but justifiable for the story. You want to take Harley and his siblings home with you and shield them from the world. You won't be disapointed in this book!"
1,A disappointment,"As I read this book, I kept asking myself ""Why did Oprah recommend this?"" Why is there such a need to write such explicit sex scenes and filth to get your point across. I felt very uncomfortable reading this book. If this was Tawni O'Dell's intent, then she succeded.I did not find it 'funny' at all.I would not allow my teenage children to read this book or recommend it to anyone I know. Will Mrs O'Dell let her children read it and will they feel the same about her afterwards? The insightfulness of Harley was the only positive thing about this book and Jody was a sweet child. Don't waste your money."
2,Oprah Trash,"The author writes well and can create strong images and convey powerful emotions. But, the good news ends here. It is no accident that Oprah selected this book. It contains the familiar message of the abuse culture: everything evil we do is really the responsibility of someone else who has treated us badly. Murder is OK, if someone (not necessarily even the murder victim) beat you. This is just dressed up talk show trash. It gives you a jolt when you read it - but it's cheaper to go stick your hand in a light socket."
5,I GIVE IT A TEN,"SIMPLY PUT , I WILL NOT WRITE WHAT THE BOOK WAS ABOUT BECAUSE THERE IS ENOUGH OF THAT ON HERE , AND IT DEFEATS THE PURPOSE OF READING THE BOOK. BUT I HAVE TO SAY .. ITS A TWISTED BOOK , BUT THE BEST BOOK I HAVE EVER READ AND I READ ALOT OF BOOKS. I PASS THIS ON TO EVERYONE .. AND YES YOU SHOULD READ IT TOO !!"
2,Overdone and gross,"I recently read this book, and I was dissapointed. I saw that is was part of Oprah's book club, so i took a chance and decided to read it. What i got was a book overflowing with over-the-top dirty and disturbing content. Normally, I find one or two disturbing twists exciting, but there are so many in this book that after you finish it you feel nauseous. The character was not likeable, the ending was terrible, and the book is innapropiete for people under 18. I would only recommend it as a book to scare you... and not the good healthy kind."
2,Coming of age soap opera,"This seems to be a popular title for both movies and novels. This one is about to become a major motion picture though I have doubts that even the author will recognize it when Hollywood is finished with it. In my library for a decade before I got around to reading it I will admit to its being sensational enough to carry one along intently to its crushing conclusion. This is not a feel-good kind of story. One is moved to feel empathy for Harley's plight realizing the while that he is hopelessly in over his head and that the outcome is not likely to be a good one. Along the way we are thrown several plot twists and unexpected turns of events that keep it interesting. What this book brings home to us most vividly is the woeful state of our social work system with its overworked and under-paid employees and the fact that justice is what can be proved in a court of law, not necessarily truth."
3,Dark and disturbing,"Hurley Altmyer is a 19-year-old who has taken on the responsibility for his three younger sisters after their mother has been convicted and sentenced to life in prison for shooting their father. He is hanging on by his fingernails - working two low-paying jobs in an effort to keep their house and the family together. But he is clearly at the breaking point, totally unable to cope or even to face the truth of what has happened and is happening.This is a dark psychological story of a family caught in a cyclone of dysfunction. It is violent and crass in places. I was caught up in Harley's life - in his skewed view of the world, and in the downward spiral he is caught in.I did think the book was rather unrelenting in its psychosis. Yes, O'Dell includes some scenes of tenderness, even a few of humor, but it is a powerful and dark vortex in which the Altmyer family (and the reader) is caught. Not a book for the faint of heart."
5,One of the best books I have read in a very long time,"What a great story; told with humor and depth. I couldn't put it down. It had everything; tragedy, humor, love, hate, violence, defiance and absurdities. Hopefully this is a first of many novels for this author."
4,FAST-PACED...DISTURBING,"Harley Altmyer has a load of responsibilities for a man of his young age.Harley's father is dead, and his mother is in prison for the murder, so he is left to raise his three younger sisters. Working two jobs, and looking for love in all the wrong places, his story of abuse, incest, and the strange relationships between siblings will unfold to answer the question...can he be the savior his family needs?""Back Roads"" is a fast-paced novel dealing with some disturbing issues. At times hilarious and heartbreaking, while also being gritty and violent, first time author, Tawni O'Dell, handles herself like a seasoned pro; dishing out the heavy subject matter, and at the same time creating a hero in Harley.This book was an Oprah pick, but don't read it for that reason, read it because it is a well written, well executed story that grabs the reader and doesn't let go. This may not be a book for everyone, but any reader looking for intense fiction should pick it up.Nick Gonnella"
2,Dark,"This book was well written and the characters fully developed, however, I found the story to be a bit over the top for my taste. I did not see one thing funny or sexy (as portrayed in some reviews) about incest, adultury, or murder.The story is dark and disturbing, without redemption. The character's extreme dysfunction was not quite believable (even in our present day society where this behavior seems to be rampant, their behavior was bizarre).Although incest, murder and adultury occur everyday, the sequence of events in this book impacted me as though I had witnessed a bad accident. The senseless wreck of lives has, unfortunately, lingered in my mind."
1,Weak...,"This story was boring and useless. It was very unbelievable and repetitive. I kept hoping the story would develop, but it never got off the ground. I found myself tired of hearing about the main character, chapter after chapter. Rent - don't buy."
1,An introduction to suicidal thoughts.,Read this book if you are in serious need of feelings of depression and suicide.
1,Disfunction-Junction!,"Was looking for an escape from reality ----- murder, incest, adultery --- just read the newspaper! I really didn't like it at all."
3,Back Roads,"This book was exceptional in that it portrayed a raw and exciting look into the mountanious, and rural region of the northeast. It examines the hopelessness that WE all feel at some time and place in our mundane, everyday and pitiful lives. Harley shows that even when you attempt to do the right things in life. Life personified is BackRoads - it was a really good read - well balanced, easy to follow, and a wonderful introduction into the life of a young man and his family."
2,"puts ""dysfunctional family"" into a new stratosphere!","I don't get all the raves. This book kept me interested, but the last 100 pages were just over the top and wierd. And some of the resolution just didn't make sense to me."
1,HORRIFIC,"Reader beware: The main themes of the story are incest, abuse and murder; the ending offers nothing in the way of redemption. The main character is a hateful young man with fantasies of sex and violence towards his younger siblings. The setting is a dismal village in rural Pennsylvania where each resident almost competes to be more hopeless than his neighbor.I am no prude and I have no problem peppering my library with a little dysfunction every now and then, but I actually finished this book feeling like a worse person. As far as I'm concerned, the only thing this author got right was picking out the cover image; a back road that leads to hell.Rating: One ""trillionth"" of a point.Suggested With: A pair of running shoes, a jet pack, a concord plane, anything that will get you the hell away from this book as fast as possible."
2,"Nothing new, nothing gained.","Having grown up in the region that O'Dell is writing about, I was eager to read this book. But BACK ROADS could be set anywhere that people are poor and more rural than urban. The setting was almost incidental, and I was disappointed. The characters too, tended to disappoint. The writing, while technically fine, tended to disappoint. There was nothing new explored here, not in terms of the family, the region or the male or female psyche. I could predict everything, which is for me, the ultimate disappointment."
2,Backroads,This book takes an intense journey into the mind of a psycho. I found the scenes in this book disturbing and pervertic. The book grossed me out considerably and should not be available to anyone under the age of 30.
4,Back Roads,"The only reason I haven't given Back Roads five stars is because of the language used and violence. I wasn't sure I'd even be able to read it, but I'm very glad I did. Once you realize that the subject matter, although shocking, is actually handled in a way that is in favor of the very best of morals, you can gain an understanding of those in very difficult circumstances. I really hope that there will be a sequel. I also hope that there will be a movie! (If there is, I have just the theme song for it. I had written it before I heard of the book, but it fits well.) The characters of the book have become like well-known acquaintances. I especially like Harley. I hope things turn out better for him in the next book."
1,Horrible Book,"I believe this book was the most depressing one I've ever read. I saw no light at the end of the tunnel and couldn't figure out why someone would write a story with absolutely no redeemable characters. Everyone in this mess is completely screwed up from either domestic abuse, incest, lies, irresponsibility, poverty, desperation, mental illness, you name it. I only finished it to see where it ended and hoped like hell SOMEONE was going to get a happy ending but alas, no. Read this book only if you like reading about non-stop misery and unhappiness."
2,Why did Oprah love this book?,"I am still trying to figure out why this book would beconsidered enjoyable. I found it very disturbing and uncomfortable.At times I wanted to stop reading because I felt like it was a trashytalkshow in words. I read email about how people loved Harley (found him endearing) I found him repulsive. The character did not even bathe. I feel that the author is a very good writer and very descriptive but the story was over the top when it came to dysfunction. I know people are saying it is true to life, but how much murder, incest and sickness can be in one family. I feel the story could have been more uplifting in some way..."
5,Best Book of the Year!!!,"Tawni O'Dell begins her book with one of the all-time best first lines and continues with that momentum to the very end. Powerful images, characters and situations. Bravo Ms. O'Dell! Thanks for the great read!Karen Albright Lin"
2,"Read ""Here on Earth"" Instead","This was a big disappointment. It was too disturbing, too dark, too depressing. I am sure that there are a lot of poeple out there who could relate to the characters, but I sure couldn't. Read ""Here on Earth"" instead. That was 100 times better!"
2,Bitter disappointment,"This could have been a great book if the characters were better developed. I felt almost cheated the further I read on ... realizing that the mystery and vagueness of Harley and his sisters' personalities were leading nowhere. The book left me feeling empty and disappointed.I find it interesting that that there is even a Reading Group Guide with 'Topics for Discussion'. Does she really believe this to be great writing? Don't flatter yourself Tawni, you're only an amateur."
4,solid debut,"This novel is asolid debut. It was well written and the main character really affected me. The story, I thought, was a bit too dramatic, though; there were too many dramas unfolding, too much angst, and not enough levity for my taste. If it were not a first novel, I would hvae given it 3 stars, which is still pretty good."
5,Dont miss this one!!,"This is one of the best books I have ever read. It is filled with secrets and leaves you guessing about what really happened all the way to the end. Surprises hit you in almost every chapter, some you expected and some you didnt. This book would make a great movie!!! You guys have got to read it!!!"
5,Best book I've read in a long time.,"This book was fantastic. Once I started it, I could not put it down. The story is dark and at times heartbreaking but at other times, quite funny. Just like real life. I was deeply touched by this book and didn't want it to end."
2,Not a very good one...sorry....,"I read alot...I am usually 3 books behind for Oprah's book club. If Oprah recommends it, I want to read it...Well this one I completely hated. It was a page turner. It kept my interest, because I kept waiting and hoping for something good to finally happen for Harley. But...wow...If you think your life is bad, read this, and you will feel better. Thanking God that this is not real, or your life. The ending made me so angry. This is one book, after I finished, I wanted to speak to the author, and ask her ""what happens next to Harley""? Please say, he was able to get his smallest sister and move far, far away. Very depressing. Completely sad."
2,Haunting yet trashy,"It has now been two weeks since I finished ""Back Roads"" and although some of the images have stayed with me and haunt me, I must say that I find the language and the content of the book to be disappointing, almost to the point of disgusting. I feel that the disfunctional family theme both in movies and in novels has just about run its course. It is a sad commentary on American society that such families do exist, to be sure, and we should be aware of their existence, but I fail to see the ultimate point of the book. I shall remember it to be sure, but I dare say that I do not have any desire to read Ms. O'Dell again."
2,It started out great and then unravelled......,"This book was so GOOD at the beginning! And then it unravelled into a mire of child abuse, incest, adultery.....I had a hard time finishing it. The epilogue was the only thing that ""saved"" it for me."
2,Spelling,"The Monsters of Rock festival is held at Castle Donington, UK: one 'n'. (There IS a Donnington Castle, but that is actually the ruins OF a castle, in a different county.) After the first 'MOR' Polydor released a compilation album, on vinyl and cassette, featuring at least one track from all bands on the bill (save for Judas Priest, who declined to be featured, it seems). Those tracks were recorded live on the day and the sound was raw but very good. Saxon's track was 'Backs To The Wall' and I had hoped this release was from the same source as had been used for that Polydor release. It patently isn't. Treat it as anything other than a cheap bootleg, providing a useful chronicle of the band's performance at the start of a legendary series of festivals, and you'll be disappointed. Now, Polydor, DO you still have those mastertapes?"
2,Its OK,So I've been using the professional cleaning an the oxygen face cream and I haven't' seen any different in my skin. The acne hasn't really gone away and after using the oxygen face cream my face only feels greasier. After I finish the tubes I don't think I will be ordering more. The Karin Herzog products haven't done anything for me so far. Not sure what all the rave is about.
2,Virtual Memories,The concept on which the story is based is far fetched. Even worse is the fact that the villain was not introduced until the story was almost over.
3,Warning- only 4 songs/11minutes!,"$11 for 11 minutes/4 songs? the Amazon UK site has this for 3 pounds (6 dollars)...the tracks are:1. Stop Stop Stop2. Bus Stop3. Carousel4. Instrumental and DanceI haven't watched this recently, but if I remember correctly these are live, not lipsynced performances.Great for Hollies fans, but not a good value..."
4,very cute and comfy,"The fit is a little larger than true to size. I would have almost gone a size smaller had I known. I would say that they are designed for bottom heavy body types (wider hips and fuller bottom) and I am not that type so a medium would have probably been a bit more flattering in the backside...but they are just for lounging around and working out, so I am not that worried about it...and just for the record, they are not hideously unflattering, I would have returned them if they were, this is for sizing information only. the look is great and they are really comfy!"
2,Almost not worth reading.,"Other than a short portion at the beginning of the book where Tohru meets another Sohma, the bulk of this book is about Uo-chan and how she became friends with Tohru. For those of us interested in the romantic aspects of the Sohma story, this was a waste of money.In fact, this book has probably put me off reading the rest of Fruits Basket. If I bought more and found them to be as dull as this one, then it would really start feeling like a rip-off."
5,A delicious romp!,"I saw this movie for the first time as a rental years ago. My initial uneasiness at seeing Roger Corman's name was not enough to keep me from giving it a try, and since then I have rented it at least seven more times, until finally I had to buy it! The cinematography is superb, the special effects range from subtle to spectacular, the cast is excellent, the story well done, and if there is any fault to be found I'll let someone else find it! Best of all, for me, despite at least one quintessential Corman touch, even that was so perfectly in tune with the story I could find no argument with the brief gore."
3,Great Movie,"This was a really fantastic movie, i only got it for the Michael Hutchence cameo, but the movie in whole was Fantastic, very interesting, great storyline."
4,monsters,very interesting movie. I like the details throughout the movie that fell in place at the end of the story.
2,Frankenstein Unbound,"I first saw this in the cinema & later on video,not much of a difference.This is just not a very good movie.John Hurt & Raul Julia are excellent but they cant save this film,nobody can."
2,"Abysmal Faire, but....","This movie would bore the heck out of anyone. Everything about it is poorly done even the acting despite the fact that it's done by John Hurt, Raul Julia and Bridgett Fonda. When I saw Roger Corman's name I was expecting something campier, but instead he came up with a yawner that one might expect to discover may have been a Sci-Fi original.I still give the movie two stars, however, for one of the worst lines I've ever heard, that manages to make the whole the parcel worth while:After spending all of an hour with the protagonist Mary Shelly says, ""Byron and Percy preach free love."" She unbuttons her blouse. ""I practise it."""
3,Good book but lacked depth,"There were a lot of liberties taken for the sake of telling a story in this one. The author could have gone deeper into the men and their effort. I would definitely recommend other books, for a historical view, first. Not a bad book just not that great either. I would recommend ""Finding the Lost Battalion: Beyond the Rumors, Myths and Legends of America's Famous Ww1 Epic"" for more depth."
5,Great Reading,"Very well researched and yet very entertaining. Hard to put down once you get into it.Lots of time period sayings, song verses,skits, and jokes.Not hard reading at all. Usually these books bore you with too much of what wasn't important. Not this book. It will definitely hold your interest."
1,BRATZ SUCK!!!!!!MY SCENE IS THE AWSOMEST!!!!!!!!!!!,"I HATE BRATZ!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!THEY ARE SOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOO SLUTTY FOR CHILDREN!!!!! DONT BUY THIS UGLY,FUGLY,BRATZ DOLL!!!!!!!!!!!!LIDIA-MY SCENE FAN-BRATZ HATER!!!!!!!!!!!"
4,well....,"I quite like this new ""Tokyo a-go-go"" line from MGA Entertainment [Bratz] and hope to be reciving some other Tokyo a-go-go for Christmas..Yasmin is quite pretty, except for the braid that is really not her thang so i took it out as soon as i got it...I don't really like Yasmin's threads (Clothes) so i took them off and gave her new ones..Overall, GREAT JOB MGA Entertainment, and a VERY Merry Christmas to everyone!!"
5,Yasmin Rocks!!!!!!!!!!!!,"Yasmin is by far the best bratz doll.I love her clothes and the green highlights in her hair.I got her for my birthday and she is soooooooooooo cool.I am sick of MGA releasing new bratz , can't they stick to the originals?Ally"
4,blackmarket theygod,"well lets start by saying blackmarket records are the best and always will be. I think you have to like your D'n'B but this isn't as good as blackmarket presents Drum and Bass, It isn't as dark and the bass line infrequently kicks like I would like. Still I recomend this to all you common Roni fans but if you want underground, dark drum and bass check out the phonix at argon records. For real."
2,"good, just not good with the double-bass.","I purchased this tuner as a replacement for my Korg CA-30, however, I was disappointed to find it would not register the low string. Now I have to purchase another Korg CA-30 anyway."
1,It quit working within 30 minutes,"This thing is a POS.I bought it because it was a Sabine. I've used a Sabine ST1000 in the past, and it worked great.However, don't was the money on a Sabine NexTune-12Z Chromatic Tuner"
5,It is great!,This soundtrack is really really good! They have great songs by great artists. I strongly recommend you buy it!
5,I rate this cd 5 stars because it is an awesome cd.,Its an awesome cd as is the t.v. show and I'm so glad that they came out with the cd.
5,For Buffy the Vampire Slayer Fans,"My girlfriend loves her Buffy the Vampire Slayer, so she loves this CD. If you were a fan of the Buffy series then this is a must own."
5,fantastic...,i love all the music on here... alison krauss and the sundays ROCK!! definitely worth buying!
3,"You win some, you lose some","This soundtrack has its hits and misses. I boohoo the second season version of Nerf Herder's Buffy Theme. I would have gone with the classic, unedited first season theme, with its screeching in the first few seconds. Also, who needs ""Teenage FBI,"" by Guided? It sounds like something older people listen to in order to ""understand"" teens... But I did enjoy K's Choice, Black Lab, the Sundays' nice version of ""Wild Horses"" (go, Buffy, Class Protector!), and Bif Naked's ""Lucky."" But, wherefore art thou Cibo Matto? -- not to mention Four Star Mary's more original song, ""Sway,"" from S-3 eppy ""Dead Man's Party"" (as Dingoes Ate My Baby). Please, do as you must do with ""Angel,"" soundtrack decision-makers: get a focus that works!"
4,Really Good!!!!!,I thought this was a really great Cd. My favourite song was Strong. Its a good album if you like 'rock' music or if you are a really big fan. At first i thought it was boring but if you listen to the songs a couple of times they grow on you! I do recomend this soundtrack!
5,Absolutely Amazing!,"This is one of the best CDs I own. It has a nice variety of music, from country ballads to hard rock and pop. My top five tracks consist of:1. ""Virgin State of Mind"", K's Choice: Very well written lyrics and nice melody.2. ""Nothing But You"", Kim Ferron: A very catchy melody. I often find myself singing along to this track.3. ""Translevanian Concubine"", Rasputina: I couldn't get this song out of my head for months. It's just the type of song I would play at a halloween party.4. ""Charge"", Splendid: Again, very clever lyrics. This band makes good use of several different styles of music.5. ""I Already Met You"", Superfine: There is a good story in the lyrics, summed up with a good catchy melody.The only downfall is that my favourite song from Buffy, ""Stupid Thing"", Nickel, isn't on the album, but then you can't have it all. Who else likes this song?"
5,I wasn't sure what to expect but it's become a favorite,"CD for me to play in the car, while working around the house or surfing the web. Before I bought the CD I wasn't familiar with any of the songs except for the show's theme; I ended up liking every song on the CD, and it's introduced me to some groups I hadn't heard of before. Favorites from this one include ""Strong,"" ""I Quit,"" and ""Already Met You."" This soundtrack has the same wit and humor that makes the show such a wonderful experience."
5,Excellent and absolutely haunting,"This album is fun, haunting, and very nifty album. Between the opening track; the theme by Nerf Herder; and the final track; the absolutely lovely and haunting Buffy and Angel theme by Christophe Beck; is an eclectic and occasionally humourous collection of songs. From the well-known Garbage, to the band Four Star Mary; the band that actually plays the songs that the TV band ""Dingoes Ate My Baby"" preforms; to the absolutely quirky Rasputina, the bands are very good and make this album worth buying even if you aren't a big Buffy fan."
5,A Perfect Mix,"Regardless of your feelings for the show, this album is supurb. There's an angsty side (like ""God is a Man"" by Face to Face), a sweet side (Alison Kraus, The Sundays), a pop side (""I Quit"" by Hepburn) - and a lot that lie somewhere in between. Imagine walking at night without being afraid of the dark. This is a showcase of true independent bands placed together in an enjoyable venue. Expose yourself to new music! Some songs may take you back to certain Buffy episodes; but trust me, if you were to anonymously play the cd for your friends who laugh at your Buffy obsession, they would fall for the music too."
5,The Best CD I Own...,"I have watched only one episode of Buffy, so I would hardly say that I'm a fan. When I was in the mall, this cd just seemed to be yelling ""Buy me!"" So, I did, and I was not disappointed. This is truly one of *the* best cds I own. It's far better than the poppy, overplayed tunes that grace the ""Dawson's Creek"" soundtrack (and did they *really* need a second one? It's worse than the first...) If you overlook ""I Quit"" by Hepburn, then this is a great cd. I love the hippy-dippy sounds of ""Wild Horses"" by The Sundays. Another great track is ""Virgin State of Mind"" by K's Choice. This song is enchanting, with beautiful lyrics and a wonderful tune. I cannot stop playing that song! There's something darkly gothic, yet soothing about it. Also Splendid's ""Charge"" is a must listen- has very good lyrics. I would say that even if you don't watch the show, but the soundtrack, especially if you like music of the alternative genre."
4,Where's Cibo Motto?,"Although I wish those tunes that I associate with Buffy the Vampire Slayer (Spoon and Sugar Water by Cibo Motto, Full of Grace by Sarah McLachlan, etc.) would have been on here, there are a LOT of new songs. ""It Doesn't Matter"" is great, I remember exactly in season 2 (""When She Was Bad"") when this song played, and ""Wild Horses"", who can forget when Angel and Buffy danced at prom? So, 4 stars, I just wish Nickle was on here..."
4,Superbokk's 2nd review,"This album has totally grown on me. It's got me through two pieces of major GCSE coursework and many sleepless sites. My favourite songs are: no.4 - 'Strong' by Velvet Chain, no.7 - 'Lucky' by Bif Naked, no.9 - 'Virgin State of Mind' by K's Choice, no.13 - 'It Doesn't Matter' by Alison Krauss and Union Station, and no.17 - 'Transylvanian Concubine' by Rasputina."
5,Definatly and completely worth it.,"I got this CD recently and I can't stop listening to it. From the songs 'Temptation Waits' by Garbage, to 'Virgen State Of Mind' by K's choice, and 'Pain' by Four Star Mary which are the one's I liked (especially 'Virgen Sate of Mind). Most of the songs really go with the show, and they are the best in the Album in my decision. Also 'Close my eyes' by Christophe Beck is a nice ending, because this score will have you reduced to tears... This to my opinion, is the best that could have been produced. You really can't go any better."
4,Must BUY for B&A Fans!,"First of all, I'm a huge fan of Buffy and Angel so if you're the same, I really recommend getting this awesome Buffy soundtrack. ^_^ Bif - Lucky is always a great song but I find this soundtrack special as it contains the Buffy opening theme song along with ""Close Your Eyes"" (Buffy/Angel Love Theme) by Christophe Beck.That's my favourite song and it ends nicely to wrap up the soundtrack (unless you have it on re-loop like me). The booklet is nice but I think it would have been nicer if the cast inputted their favourite songs or something. =("
5,"wow, totally for buffy fans",since hearing the album i can't stop it is such a greate cd. this album has to be bought if your a buffy fan. The cd has such a greate mixture of sounds which makes the cd even more superb. My favourite is 'It Doesn't Matter' by Alison Krauss and the Union stations.
3,Superbokk's review,"Reasonably good, although Hepburn's 'I Quit' doesn't fit in at all. My favourite song is 'Virgin State of Mind' by K's Choice. My advice is if you're buying it for the Buffy anthem, don't. (It only lasts a minute.)That's why I bought it. Hmmph!"
4,"The BTVS album is so good, your ears will bleed!","If you are a fan of the WB shows(Dawson's Creek, 7th Heaven, etc.), then you will really be able to bite into this Album. It has numerous soft rock/alternative songs. The album fortunately has a lot of variety into it, so you will be able to listen to the whole album while slaying vampires, without stopping to change the track. If you like the Dawson's Creek soundtrack, which was also exceptionally good, then you will like this soundtrack because they are so similiar, which is good! I'm out of here, because the album is so great, that my blood shivers when I don't listen to the soundtrack."
4,I great album for a great show.,"I have been a fan of Buffy for about three years now. Of course, as a good fan I had to get the soundtrack. The music from this album is awesome. I love the Garbage song, ""Temptation Waits"". I was already a huge fan of Bif Naked, though I think ""Lucky"" is one of their weaker songs. I would have rather they had put ""Anything"" on this album. By far my favorite song on the album is ""Transyvanian Concubine"". The song is a little odd, and not for the average listener. Still, I am a sucker for strings. I recommend Rasputina's album ""Thanks for the Ether"" and Bif Naked's ""I Bificus"" to anyone who likes the Buffy Soundtrack."
4,Pretty Good I guess,"Well I read all the reviews for this cd so i thought i should check it out considering that everyone liked it so much. anyway, some of the songs on here are amazing, the best one by far is Lucky by Bif Naked. K's Choice and Black Lab are good too but the rest of the cd is kinda cheesy. I like about half the songs. The cd is worth buying but I doubt you'll be playing it over and over."
2,Wish I hadn't bought it,"Listen to this and other reviews - this CD does not have many recognizeable Buffy songs. I'm a HUGE fan and I've never heard of most of these. The CD with the Score is amazing, however. It has no vocals but it's very impressive.Buffy the Vampire Slayer: The Score"
3,good!,"it is a good album that works...i hadn't heard those bands before(maybe 'cos i'm italian and so..)but i found the cd great. anyway it's good but nothing more. i liked very much ""lucky"" performed by bif naked , ""temptation waits"" by garbage and ""god is a man"". a good work like the tv series... buffy wins again! just hear ""buffy's theme"" and u'll believe what i've said before!"
3,Slightly disappointed,"I am a huge Buffy fan and was very excited to purchase the CD. I was disappointed by the omission of one particular song on the cd. I fully expected the song that played at the end of the season finale when Buffy ""killed"" Angel. The song when she was getting ready to leave town, and she was watching her friends...it was such a gripping emotional song, that I thought for sure it would be on there. I was only interested in that song and the Buffy/Angel Love theme. The rest I can do without."
5,"""Lucky"" Rules","I bought this album just for ""Lucky"", by Bif Naked. After I heard the song in one episode this past season, the album was first on my Christmas list. I listened to some of the other songs and thought, ""Hey, these are really good!"" Some of my favorites are K's Choice, ""Virgin State of Mind"", Rasputina, ""Transylvanian Concubine"", Hepburn, ""I Quit"", Black Lab, ""Keep Myself Awake"", and of course, Bif Naked,""Lucky"". The gothic theme to these great alt bands fits right in with the shows theme. I recommend this album to any fan of the show."
3,Mediocre,"I honestly would say that this disc is FAR inferior to the second soundtrack to the TV show, ""Radio Sunnydale"". There are songs on this CD that were never on the show (Teenage FBI), don't fit the tone (""I Quit""), or songs that just plain suck (""Wild Horses""). While it is nice to have the title track by NerfHerder, the great redeeming song on the first soundtrack is the score ""Close Your Eyes"". While this album may have paved the way for ""Radio Sunnydale"", it falls far short.Buy the soundtrack to the musical episode ""Once More With Feeling"", ""Radio Sunnydale"", and then see if you have the extra change left over for this soundtrack."
4,All Good,I bought this because I wanted to own the music from the show and that is exactly what I got. Yay!
4,Super Cute!,"I hadn't heard of this movie, but my husband got it for my little girl who loves monkey's and this movie is funny and really cute. Fun for the whole family!"
3,Campy Fun But not For Fans,"Though true Star Trek fans are appaled at this episode, and I admit in many ways it is just plain dreadful, it is a lot of fun if you don't take it too seriously.It has a sexy green girl, a crazed mad man, a Tellerite and Andorian...I mean admit it! It's gotta be fun!It is not intelligent, poetic Trek for what made the show famous, but it is entertaining!If you watch the shows for deep meaning, you will not enjoy this episode, b ut I don't feel it deserves all the critisism it gets. It is certainly one of the ""darker"" episodes and one of the <sadly> last.Buy at your own risk but it is certainly fun and the ending is a neat little twist."
2,It could just be me.................................,"It is probably just my own particular preference. This book just did not grab me. First of all at my age, I had difficulty reading the print. The recipes did not catch my eye."
3,Average,"I'm a huge Byrds fan and I especially like the last lineup of Battin, McGuinn, Parsons and White--but this cd is just kind of boring. There really isn't anything exactly wrong with it, and there definitely are at least three classics-'Truck Stop Girl', 'All The Things' and 'Just A Season'-but the rest is just nice and, well, boring. The live material is good, but aside from 'Eight Miles High', it's also...a bit boring. I'd not want to steer anyone away from this cd, because there are flashes of brilliance even in the tracks I haven't mentioned. But I'd recommend their final album, ""Farther Along"" if you had a choice between the two. That cd is, I believe, still available as a Japanese import, and it is simply awesome. Even ""Byrdmaniax"", with all of it's quite obvious overproduction, is more engaging than ""Untitled"" is. To me, that is."
3,THE CHARLES BAND DVD COLLECTION VOL.1,"I ordered this collection because I had an urge to see Meridian,which if you enjoy the classic Beauty and the Beast type storyline then this is a movie for you.The other movies in this collection are entertaining with all of the B movie cheesy plots and special effects."
2,Nothing new in book compared to movie,"I am a committed BG fan, but this book was a waste. I expected it to have expanded detail and sub plots not included in the movie. It didn't. I could have sat in front of my TV and written this in no time. I appreciate the author for trying to feed my BG need, but this book was not worth reading if you saw the movie. I never not finish a book, but with this one, I didn't even reach page 100."
2,Liked the book but not the reader,"The book was exactly what I thought it was going to be. However, the actor reading it constantly mispronouces names and the shorthand of the military speak. As Capt. Apollo once said, ""C-A-G, That pornounced CAG."" Everytime the reader spells it out or calls Sharon Valerii and pronouces it as ""Valerie"" I cringe."
3,Great Author,"I really like the author. The writing style is good and engaging.I stopped reading the story, however, because it doesn't seem to add anything to the overall story. I'll be honest, I was hoping for more mini-stories, background, and revelations.I will probably seek out other work from this author, but as far is this story goes: been there, done that.I'd recommend it for people who haven't watched the series though."
2,"A bland, emotionless reading...","I wasn't expecting much... and that's what I got. As a rule, I find that most abridged readings are stale and uninteresting. However, I really dig BSG so I thought I'd give this one a shot. I didn't care for it very much. It told the story... it got the details right. However, it seemed to me that Jonathan Davis was just going through the motions and wasn't putting any emotion behind the words. This performance was significantly bit less than stellar. I didn't hate it... but it's priced low for a reason."
2,Less than the original,"When I read this book, I thought I would gain insight into the minds and hearts of the characters that could not be expressed on film... this book did not give that. It's more a printed version of the Battlestar Galactica mini-series/pilot and nothing more.Another thing that disappointed me was that I personally enjoy the differing viewpoints of religion in the show and in this book it is so inconsistent that it's almost jarring when I find it. When most of the Colonials say ""Gods"" it's spelled as ""God's"". I have to wonder if Jeffrey Carver actually saw the show to know that the Colonials' religion was polytheistic while the Cylons' were monotheistic.The 2 stars I gave were pretty much for its association with Battlestar Galactica."
4,Ignore the inconsistencies; it's a good novelization,"Other reviewers noted small inconsistencies between this novelization and the miniseries it was based on: like using ""Husher"" for Adama's callsign instead of ""Husker."" My thoughts: no big deal. The novel stayed true to form, and was a quick, enjoyable read. I don't care to put in spoilers, so I'll leave it at that.I'm also pretty impressed with Carver's willingness to post some of his novels for free. It shows a pretty modern attitude, willing to try out different methods of marketing and outreach. For the record, what goes around comes around - in recognition of Mr. Carver's willingness to provide free material, I ended up making a paypal donation."
1,Nothing New,"There is nothing in this novelization that is not in the miniseries on dvd. Novelizations are only interesting if they contain deleted scenes, or some background material from the screenplay that was not filmed, or (occasionally) new information created by the author to flesh out the story. This does none of that."
4,a stripped-down sound,"Geoff Farina's solo album is definitely worth your time. The entire album is acoustic music, which I enjoy more than a lot of people... If you only buy it for ""The Same Way"" it is still a great purchase... This song has been running through my stereo non-stop since I bought this album. A song about a failed relationship... something we have all gone through... he sings, ""I hear you say I have to change. I can not change. Of course I turn and you're not there."" His voice is melodic and soothing as always... if you are familiar with Karate (his band), then you already know what I am talking about. Their new album, ""The Bed Is In The Ocean"", is the best I've heard from them. Geoff is heading in a positive direction with, and without his band."
2,it's about time someone remixed a TKK song...,"...(i'm kidding, of course)Bullet points!1: Production value sucks. Cheap sounding effects, vocals and sampling on a lot of tracks.2. Crummy programing. Very basic run of the mill, nothing you haven't heard before.3. Very little thought put into the mixes.EXCEPT FOR:""Leathersex"" - very good mix. Borderline electroclash.""Dementia 66"" - BRILLIANT mix! Very different, nice interpretation.I am really impressed with this one!!!In fact I only wrote this review to praise Grayarea on thier mix!These two tracks are what this project SHOULD have been about!____"
3,Good but-Huh?,"This is a nice dictionary- IF you have some knowledge of the Irish language.It is VERYY HARD to figure out how to say the majority of words in here without that knowledge. There are a few exceptions however.It's a good dictionary,it's just that I'm sorta ignorant.A phonetic Irish/English dictionary would be cool!"
3,Some good points but with a harsh tone,"This author brings up a number of points for authors to keep in mind when writing about Native Americans, and clearly defines sensitive issues revolving this. However, her tone is often sharp and at times I was turned off. Although it may not be the author's intent, I gathered that she doesn't feel non-natives should in fact write about Natives. I have seen this done poorly but I've also read many fine works that to me were respectful and not stereotypical. I wanted to get more from this book but came away feeling like I'd just been preached to by someone assuming the worst."
1,Ethics is a two-way street,"Prof Mihesuah has a lot to say about other people's ethics but sees fit to write a 5-star review of her own book using the space provided for reader reviews, even though there is a separate area provided for authors to make their own comments. As a published author myself, I wouldn't dream of doing this. It's completely unethical and undermines any valid arguments she puts forward in her book."
1,Go to Hell Carruthers,"This DVD is a worthless piece of trash. I have read Fripp's comments concerning this DVD release and I agree with his point of view. The 'Classic Rock' production co. that made this DVD is a mirror image of the ills of the recording industry.The nerve that this Carruthers band of thugs has to more or less threaten Fripp & Co! It doesn't matter, Robert will have the last laugh, as DGM's DVDs sell and this does not.Please go to http://www.dgmlive.com to enjoy the history of King Crimson. All you have to do is download the music and liner notes to see King Crimson's great history in music. dgmlive.com is an amazing website! Don't bother with Amazon!(I think that Amazon.com should get rid of this DVD. It's not a legitimate product - and it's not going to sell!)"
1,Classic Rock Productions are unethical / but only Mr. Fripp can rectify the root problem.,"Every criticism of this DVD is correct, the clips are cut short, their are numerous comments from unknown ""experts"" that are in no way related to the band, and provide no new insights into the music, and everything is completely unauthorized by the band. However, the band and it's fans will continue to be victimised by poor quality releases such as this unlit Robert Fripp and the band release a quality DVD chonicling Crimson from 1969-1974."
5,as good as any of them,"Rich Mullins' music grew out of a heart that earnestly sought to be God's. Rich saw them largely as Christian entertainment. Yet as Jesus said, we know a tree by its fruit--and much fruit has come from the music of this remarkable man. Never Picture Perfect contains some of Rich's greatest songs. ""First Family"" was a song Rich wrote for his Mom and Dad on their anniversary. If it does not move you, nothing will. ""The Love of God"" is possibly the greatest song Rich ever wrote. ""Somewhere"" and ""Bound to Come Some Trouble"" are also up there in the pantheon of Rich's songs. Rich Mullins made some remarkable CDs in his time. Never Picture Perfect is as good as any of them. The greatest thing I can think to say about Rich or this disc is that he, like his parents, ""worked to give faith hands and feet--and somehow gave it wings."""
5,Just plain nice!,"The cd I ordered was delivered quickly, the product was in great condition and I am enjoying my music and I would not hesitate to order again."
2,rattles around.,I put this on six months ago and sometimes it justs starts slapping around and making a fluttering noise. I tightened it up but it didn't seem to help. I wouldn't recommend.
3,Compact but good on rough grass.,"I was a little disappointed at the size of the wheelbarrow, I had expected it to be somewhat bigger. Definitely for the little ones to wheel around, and not for adults to assist, unless you want a bad back to follow. Still, it was very simple to put together and was durable in our graded and bumply garden."
2,A suprisingly poor release,"Rich Mullins is normally known for his introspective lyrics and catcy melodies, but on this project he suffers in both areas. However there is one bright spot, ""What Susan Said"". This is Rich Mullins at his songwriting best. He mixes personal comments with a darn right hummable melody. Also Reed Arvin greatly overproduced this whole album. IF your not a hardcore Mullins fan, don't bother. END"
2,Letdown after Songs in Ordinary Time,"I was excited to read another book by M.M.Morris after enjoying her masterful, fascinating book, Songs in Ordinary Time. I could predict the ending and who her ""real father"" is about a quarter way through the book. I was hoping I was wrong and the plot would be interesting, but it isn't. If you want some silly beach reading, get the paperback. It is a bit entertaining. Don't spend the money for the hardback though. It is full of typos. It seems no one proof read it. I find that very irritating."
1,take a pass,"truly bad. I read four books per week, and maybe twice a year don't finish one. Fiona Range is one of those. I don't know which was worse:1. the egregious typos -- authors get to read the galleys before they go to press -- was Morris too lazy, or what?2. lack of plot, dialogue that does not progress the story, repetitive scenes"
3,Good easy read,"I picked this up on the bargain bin, and it was a good little read. I got a little annoyed with Fiona for always being the victim. Seems like it would be easier to just pick up and go somewhere where no one thinks that you are the worst thing around. But it was entertaining nonetheless."
3,It was ok,"I found that I was able to predict the ending very early on as well. I did find it hard to put down though. I did not, however, like the clean, happy ending. Givin the amount of psychological problems that the main character has or probably has, it doesn't seem to fit."
5,I LOVED IT,"Where do I start? At the beginning of course. Fiona's character jumps off the page from the start, in fact her life was thrilling to the end of the novel. Morris once again paints a complete portrait of a woman. By the time I finished I felt I knew Fiona inside and out. If she waited on me at the local diner here in town, I'd spot her before I read her nametage. But it wasn't just Fiona. This book is packed with 3-dimensional characters. The judge-what a crafty, yet somehow still respectable man. (By the way, has anyone stopped to follow how Morris portrays judges in her four novels? That would be an interesting essay itself) His wife, Aunt Arlene-keeping up appearances no matter the cost. Dear Elizabeth-Almost as complex a character as Fiona. Get this book, you won't be disappointed."
1,Right down there with the worst I've ever read.......,"Repetitive, silly, ridiculous, tedious, monotonous....if you've started reading this book, do yourself a favor and just skip to the 2 last chapters and save yourself some valuable time. Thank goodness I got mine at the library and didn't waste my money."
3,Could have been better.,"This is the story of a 30 year old waitress who hasn't done anything with her life and seems to do nothing but cause problems. I enjoyed reading this book but wish that it wasn't so transparent. Mary is a gifted writer but this book needed a little more meat and some speed to it.This short review comes from a reader who's favorite books include, She's come undone, White Oleander, Amy and Isabel and loved the Bridget Jones'"
3,"Predictable, but good reading anyway","Poor Fiona Range. If only people would LISTEN to her, she'd probably not be in half the trouble she got into. At times I wanted to scream at Fiona to tell those around her to just sit down and shut up, already, so they could hear her side of the story before they judged her. But if she did that, we wouldn't have a story, now would we? At any rate, I found this book enjoyable, but somewhat frustrating, as I figured out before I had gotten past the dust jacket one of the big secrets of the novel, and the other secrets became just about as obvious as the novel went on. Still, this novel teaches its readers a very important lesson, one that hit home with me, anyway -- peace at any price is not worth it."
1,She's written better,"I found this book SO exasperating. Fiona is totally unsympathetic. Within a single paragraph, she thinks she's being dismissed by her family, then she likes them, then her feelings are hurt by some perceived slight, and on and on it goes. I thought it was carelessly written; it felt very lazy to me - it could have done with serious editing. Plus, I couldn't shake the feeling that the book was set in the 40s or 50s, which is fine, if the book REALLY were set in those decades; I had to keep reminding myself this was supposedly set in the current day. I finished the book because I just had to see if it was going to be ludicrous to the very end, and it was. Even the ""happy ending"" was apathetic and tacked-on.I've liked the author's other books, so I was most disappointed when I finally got my hands on this one. I did finish it, but I sure won't be passing it on to my friends!"
2,Depressing!,"For a book as long as ""Fiona"" is, one might think that the author would be able to create likeable, sympathetic characters and bring their actions to some type of believable conclusion. HOWEVER, this novel was 400 pages of sad stories, meaningless sex, and nonstop disappointment. I expected so much, and kept waiting for the good stuff to start... I didn't like any character, and the ending was a monstrous let-down! Read if you need something to waste your time."
1,Save your money...,"This is my first MMMorris book and my first Amazon review - I read a lot but have not taken the time to ever write a review. I feel compelled to because this book was so bad - I want to warn others about it so they don't waste their money! The story was so repetitive and boring and MMM's writing was very poor. The story line was transparent - there were no surprises whatsoever. I had it all figured out about 1/3 of the way through and just slogged through the repetition and confusion so I could see if it got any better. Also, the editing was horrible - the book was full of typo's, missed punctuation, and incorrect words (cold instead of could, for example). I want my money back from the publisher - shame on them!"
2,I should get my wasted time and money back.,"Fiona Range is a good book for someone who does not know good literature. There are so many typos that it is distracting to someone who knows how to use grammar. Tbe plot is too simplisitic for a book this long--maybe better suited to a novella or a short-story. Also, the characters, excepting for Fiona, were very shallow and needed more purpose. Considering that the author has written much more enjoyable novels previous to this--it leaves the reader with the sense that it was intended as a money-maker, not a heart-warmer."
2,Amiable Effort,"You can almost see MMM trying to bring out the characters, to shed some sort of three-dimensional light on them, as well as giving some meaning to their interactions. There are too many characters, however, and past the 200th page you kind of stop caring whether Jack wants to live up to his fathers expectations, or that Elizabeth is torn up inside about her feelings. Fiona keeps making stupid decisions and having sex with every TOm Dick and Harry that knocks on her door. Not to mention the fact she keeps associating herself with Patrick, after what he's done to her. She acts like a battered woman, but meanwhile she's supposed to be some sort of strong, outspoken diva. Perhaps it shows up her different faucets, but afer the fifth time she hangs up on Patrick and the thrid time she gets caught trying to get in some guy's pants, it gets kind of annoying. This could have been a very insightful book, instead, it reads like a soap opera. I hate soap operas."
1,Morris and Fiona have failed...,"I am always on the lookout for stong female characters, Fiona has proved to be the weakest yet. With her life revolving around one man to the next, she never takes the time to evaluate her own NEGATIVE choices and take stock in her own worth as a human being. I kept reading simply for this hope, but it never arrived. In the end, Fiona still takes pleasure out of seeing other lives destroyed. Only skillful writing could have saved this character, and unfortunately Morris has failed. Fiona's story is thinly constructed. Morris's novel is devoid of any quality literary technique. And I certainly hope that the copy editors of Viking have been retrained, as misspelled words and punctation errors further scar this already poorly written novel. May I never fall in the type of love that The Philidephia Inquirer calls Morris ""a master at depicting."""
2,"Sophomoric, read like a bad romance novel","I am not a snob, but I do have high standards, and I believe the author wrote ""down"" to us . . . nowadays, the population is fairly sophisticated. I found many editing mistakes and was surprised that Viking/Penguin had published it. There were too many contractions - speaks to the entire book being poorly written. Ms. Morris - I challenge you to rise above mediocrity.Why does this all of a sudden happen in Fiona's 30th year . . . what on earth has she been doing for the past 12 years since HS graduation? She is shallow, petty and childish, and not a character I care to read about.Less than halfway into the book, I figured out the ending . . . so much for plot twists. There's an incredible amount of foreshadowing.I am honestly surprised so many readers enjoyed it, but I doubt if my views are in the minority. However, since it was an Oprah book, my hopes may have been too high."
1,Surprisingly bad.,"MMM is a good writer (especially A Dangerous Woman), but this book is flat.Fiona is unsympathetic. She is a 30 year old brat. Her feeling of being an outsider is self-induced, and the constant episodes where she is ""acting out"" are repetitive and exasperating. The other main characters are equally repellant.The book suffers from sloppy editing, as well.No one hits a home run with every book, but this one doesn't even make it to first base."
2,Easy book to read; too soap opera bubbly for me,"I must say I was a little disapointed with this book. I got more excitment when Billy Ray Tuggle and Opal were introduced years ago on ""All my Children"". At least they could act. Fiona was a whiney woman who just made me sick instead of sorry for her. Her cousin was a poor excuse for a human being constantly crying and acting like a two-year old. I felt like I was reading a book about two woman who where psychiatric cases. That premise would have been interesting if I actually had any feeling for these characters. The only person I had any interest in was Fiona's father. He was an interesting character study. I recommend this book to anyone who wants to read something to take up time on an airplane or bus ride. I think I would have been more satisfied reading a Harliquin Romance or watching Spongebob Squarepants."
5,I could'nt stop reading!,"This book was by far the best ever by Mary McGarry Morris. The characters were so real and the ending...what can I say, I never suspected it! I loved this book and was done with it within a week. Fiona Range is a character who you really feel sympathy for. i'm sure everyone knows a ""Fiona Range."" Eventhough, she frustrates the reader, and I felt like taking the book and shaking it, Fiona is a great character with a witty unique personality."
3,4 star effort that fizzles at end,"I thoroughly enjoyed this book until about the last 20 pages or so. I would definitely rate the previous part 4 stars, but the ending deserves only 2 stars. Morris did an excellent job of describing Fiona and her place in her family. Most people probably even know a Fiona....nothing is her fault and everyone is plotting against her. Morris's descriptions are vivid and satisfying. It's too bad that she seems to have failed to wrap the story up in any meaningful way and simply went for the ""movie of the week"" ending. What a shame because I really enjoyed the book before the ending."
5,An Absolute Must Have for the Existential-Humanistic Therapist or Therapist in Training,Bugental's book is captivating and inspiring for any therapist wanting to work on truly bringing the therapy into the room. You will learn from Bugental in many ways professionally and personally by reading his refreshing perspective.
1,"Parents, think twice","If you think this single is an opportunity to pick up the popular 'Walking on the Sun' for your child without the x-rated lyrics found in the other songs on the full album, you are mistaken. Some of the other cuts on the single are inappropriate."
5,I love it!!!,"I absolutely adore this song! It's catchy and has a great beat, and funny lyrics! It's one of my favorites!"
2,Good song and trash,"Smashmouth fluked a popular single by abandoning their usual style, if the rest of the songs on this single are any indication. ""Walking on the Sun"" is a good sixties send-up, and catchy to boot. The rest of the songs here are amazingly bad, full of screaming and howling. What an awful din."
1,Walkin' on the sun,"The CD was in great shape, I bought it used. This Smashmouth CD was not very good all together. Just one good song on it."
5,Andrew,Walking on the sun is like the best song i have ever herd i would give it 10 stars but there is only 5
2,Some helpful information but overall a big disappointment.,"There are a number of helpful tips in this book. But, there is **no where near enough information** to make it worthwhile. The title gives you the impression you can buy this book and get right down to work. Don't believe it.The author rarely does much more than talk generalities. He never gives the kind of detail you need to really begin thinking about all that must be considered when launching into a huge project like building your own house. At points, he says in essence ""I could spend pages talking about this subject, but I won't."" Okay, then where is the reader supposed to get all the stuff the author couldn't be bothered to include?Again, I'm not saying this book has no value. I got some useful information out of it, but the book overall was a real big disappointment.Good luck with your project!"
2,Build Dream Home for Less,"While this book has some useful tips for dealing with subcontractors, the book is outdated. There are other books available that will be of better value."
5,An exceptional work depicting the better parts of Alaska!,"I have lived in Alaska all of my life and I have never found anything that described this land to its fullest. Wayne Mergler's anthology is one of the few works that takes both Alaskan and non-Alaskan authors to describe not only the adventures and dreams found here, but also the riches. Included in this Anthology, are authors like Jack London, John Haines, Nick Jans, Margaret Murie and many others. From poems and legends to excerpts of novels, this anthology has something for everyone. This work is not only a good book for Alaskans to read, but also any people in the lower-48 who ahve never been here, or still think that Alaska has nothing to offer except snow and ice"
3,"Ordered M/L, received S/P","Ordered a medium/large, received the small/petite. I still liked how it looked, but had to give to a friend as it did not fit."
2,Small Petite = Medium/Large,"I ordered a Small Petite scarlet garter belt and received a M/L. Thinking that it was a mistake, I returned it and ordered another one Small Petite I ended up getting another M/L. I have a feeling that they're probably just all M/L."
1,THE MUSIC OF MAXWELL,I TRUELY BELIEVE THAT MAXWELL'S WORDS DEFINE A POWERFUL WOMAN. MOST OF HIS SONGS DESCRIBE A STRONG WOMAN AND AS A WOMAN HIS SONGS MAKE ME FEEL GOOD. AND HE IS A GREAT PERFORMER.
4,A master of funky Fender Rhodes,"I always refer friends to Weldon Irvine and this CD in particular whenever the discussion comes up about the best examples of nasty, funky electric piano. It just doesn't get better than this. If you ever delved into the Blue Note releases of late 60s Jazz/Funk (many people were introduced to these gems following the success of US3 back in the early 90s), then you've almost certainly heard Irvine's Rhodes work, even if you didn't know it. Many of Donald Byrd's killer grooves are built around W.I.s work on the keys. Great stuff."
5,Perfect!,"Ever had one of those songs speak to you and you can't get it out of your head? Found it on this CD and made the purchase in time for Christmas. Wonderful service and the product was exactly what I'd heard, not to mention the rest of the songs on this CD are great for Christmas."
5,The best christmas album ever!,"It was and still is, my absolute favorite Christmas album. Michael W. Smith is an amazing artist. This will always be my favorite Christmas album."
2,Poor Quality Recording,I love Michael W. Smith's music but this CD is very poorly produced. The sound is not up to the standard of his other music.
3,nice Christmas cd,nice Christmas CD from Micheal. Allot of Orginal Christmas songssung by gospel biggest artist.
4,You cannot go wrong buying this book,"There are three excellent reasons to buy this book. First, Tom Siebel is the # 1 player in the CRM revolution, which is overturning how business gets done. Second, this book will seriously help you get outside the box and think about e-business not tactically but with vision. Third, the case studies in this book are amazing and will help you to understand the range of possibilities available to your organization."
3,"Pretty Cute, My Baby Loved It","BUT, it was a little short! Her rear end was hanging out... Also, the skirt was not attached very well to the bodice and it separated even though we did not tug it on or anything.... I am giving it 3 stars because we were able to sew it right back on without much trouble and mostly because my baby thinks it is so ""pre-ey""!"
4,Adorable,"Our daughter was a hit at the kids halloween party in this thing. The only downside for me was the wings; the velcro's a little weak, and they get glitter everywhere. The outfit's pretty darned cute even without the wings, and easy to get on/off for diaper changes. You'll want black tights and a one-sleeve onesie to put underneath it."
4,Adorable costume for baby,"This costume is very cute, but it is definitely not a durable purchase. It is 100% polyester. The top is stretchy and a little scratchy. My daughter is 17lbs and 28 inches. The top was a little big on her but still very cute, and the length was perfect. I was a little concerned the material would bother her skin, but she didn't care. As another reviewer mentioned, the wings do not stay on very well, but they can be made to stick long enough for a picture. If you want the skirt to be as poofy as shown in the picture, you'll need to starch it to give it some extra lift."
4,TRACK LISTING:,"1. Big Man on Paper2. Fool's Gold3. Force of Nature4. Haunted Episodes5. Fly6. Here It Comes Again7. Crawlin' Fom the Wreckage8. Partner for Life9. Disney's America10.

2,works but cheaply made,"I've built a new computer and want to keep the cables tidy, this cable does fit that bill. Looks good in the case but after a few cable re-routes I realized that the hoods and cable body are seperate pieces. There is nothing molded about this cable, but it does work."
3,Interesting legends about the afterlife,"This book was originally published in 1893. Father Schouppe presents an interesting collection of short legendary accounts of purgatory. Schouppe points out that his purpose is not an academic presentation or an argument. Instead he has written an understandable and entertaining volume that assumes the existence of purgatory, and can be read easily by anyone. The stories contained in it deal with the questions of the location, purpose, pains, and duration of purgatory. And it deals with how living people can relieve the souls suffering in purgatory, and how to avoid purgatory.For non-catholics, it would be helpful to keep a dictionary with Roman Catholic terms nearby when reading this. But while reading this book, I kept remembering John 19:30 when Jesus said ""it is finished"", and Hebrews 1:3 ""Who ... when he [i.e.,Jesus] had by himself purged [i.e., made purgation for] our sins, sat down at the right hand of the majesty on high;"" KJV"
1,Major disappointment,"I ordered this cd expecting to hear more great songs like dirty epic, pearls girl, and dark and long only to find out that this is just complete 80s music. blah. It is cds like this you wish they had samples of before you order (sounds a lot like change the weather so check out those samples). If you like ambient/electronic underworld, avoid this cd. I give it the one star because as far as 80s songs go, the song underneath the radar is pretty good."
2,Where is Underworld,"I understand that groups evolve over time. I admit that I am a relative newcomer to Underworld, but they did ""rock my world"" when I first discovered them. They have had such energetic, innovative songs. For this reason I feel it necessary to warn future buyers that this album is not related in any apparent way to their prior musical sounds. Though I respect them, this album sounds like George Michael through and through. If you like George Michael, then you will enjoy. I was hoping for something ""Underworld.""If you, like me, are hoping for something new and creative, you will be disappointed. Perhaps the title ""Underneath the Radar"" is fitting. It sounds nothing like anything they have ever made before, nor do I hope they make again."
1,Stay clear of this first release,I could not believe this disaster is from the band I know and love today. If anything it's a testament to their longevity. Other than that this album holds no value for fans of this band.
2,Neurotica,"Compared with Karl Hyde's first band Freur (producing 1984's acclaimed album ""Doot-doot"" and a hit single of the same name), Underworld's debut is somewhat of a disappointment. And there's certainly no resemblance to Underworld's music in the '90s. The band comes up with a limp electro-rock style, clearly lacking the hit appeal and catchy melodies that distinguished Freur's work. Most of the music plods along boring anti-rhythms, plastic guitar riffs, and ludicrous lyrics. Rupert Hine, who has worked with bands like Rush and Saga, gives a flawless, dynamic production, but the song material just doesn't catch fire. Nevertheless, I think the uptempo ""I need a doctor"", the lofty ""Bright white flame"", and the title track are quite rewarding. ""Glory! Glory!"" was released as a single, but it failed to chart just about everywhere. Of interest only to hardcore fans who are looking to buy anything with the Underworld name on it."
1,Oh the shame!,"The album Underworld wish would disapear.This is a terrible 80s Depeche Mode meets Yaz rip off. Underworld realized this quickly after realeasing this horrible album. By the early 90s, many of the members quit, and the survivors went on to build one of the best electronica acts in the world. Buy any (and every) Underworld album EXCEPT this one!You have been warned!"
5,"Using consumption surveys, chapters provide lively insights into evolving American eating habits","American wasn't born a meat-eating nation: it evolved from colonial to modern times and was as much influenced by technological developments and processing and production advancements as by consumer tastes or meat availability. PUTTING MEAT ON THE AMERICAN TABLE: TASTE, TECHNOLOGY, TRANSFORMATION is a lively study which will also earn a place on the college bookshelf for its scholarly side in examining how new technologies have advanced American meat. Using consumption surveys, chapters provide lively insights into evolving American eating habits.Diane C. Donovan, EditorCalifornia Bookwatch"
4,An excellent introduction,"Picking up David S. Reynolds' WALT WHITMAN armed with almost total ignorance of the poet, I was satisfied in finishing that I had gained a good grounding in Whitman's life, times, and work. The first chapter, a brief biography, lays the foundation for those that follow on Whitman's art and his response to, among other things, war, sex, and science. Annoyingly there are four typographical errors within its 138 pages of text, but WALT WHITMAN nevertheless succeeds marvelously in providing scholarly content to the generalist in a crisp, well-organized style."
4,pretty damn good,"i would buy this album for ""arpeggiator"" alone, but most of the other songs are great as well (""break"", ""five corporations"", etc.)"
4,Heading uphill again,"Finally Fugazi has released an album which is better than the previous one, after hitting bottom with Red Medicine. End Hits contains just enough gritty hooks and shout-alongs to make the discordant interludes tense instead of wanky (""Break"", ""Caustic Acrostic""), and their patented chunks of controlled feedback return in great form (""Floating Boy""). If I were new to Fugazi I'd get Repeater first, or maybe 13 Songs: if you're an ex-fan wondering whether they were ever going to stop sucking, go ahead and buy it."
2,Post-punk experiments,"2 1/2 starsWhile not an inspired work, their are many great ideas on this album, especially given the narrow genre that fugazi helped innovate..Alot of the compositions seem to be trying a little too hard in the wrong directions..There is a huge attempt to bridge out as far as possible on every track in an individualistic sense, but the notes just arent really there..It is in its most simple moments ironically, that fugazi affects their listeners most earnestly one last time....."
4,Way better than most critics make it out to be,"I don't listen to Fugazi much but when I do I put in newer Fugazi, because in my opinion it is much more creative and interesting than their older stuff. End Hits has countless magical moments and nicely crafted songs, so I'd say it's my favorite Fugazi disc. Be sure to check out ""No Surprise"" and ""Arpeggiator""."
5,"Incredible, Fugazi has come so far","Fugazi had been progressing musically on every album since their inception but ""End Hits"" is probably the crowning achievment of those progressions. The album starts with ""Break"" an amazing song which showcases more of Brendan Canty's great jazz-influenced drumming. After ""Break"" it rolls right into ""Place Position"" a really propelling song that also manages to be different. The album continues on displaying so much blending of styles, riffs, drumming, effects, moods, feelings and subtle nuances to keep you involved in it for years. That's right I have been listening to it for years and STILL pick up new things (noises, sounds, all kinds of stuff). This is the way an album should be. Also the title joke is kind of funny too, if you can figure it out. Another must-have."
5,Dont let them brainwash you,"At other sites they get some useless reviewer to put in ""moderate"" this and ""mediocre"" that about this album. UBL's site review for example only likes the more hard edged stuff. Fugazi cant do anything else??? i think so. sorry didnt mean to moan but you HAVE to hear this album. theres only a maximum of 1000 words and that isnt even close to getting my point halfway across."
4,Fugazi at their best,"I love this album! I have to admit firstly, though, I was no Fugazi fan before this. Friends had subjected me to ""Repeater"" time and time again...I just didn't get them. Then this! ""Arpeggiator"" is a superb track, but I also think ""Five Corps"" and some of the other tracks are catchy.This album has Fugazi leaning more towards sounding like they're from Chicago than DC, but then , Trans Am is from DC, too, aren't they?"
2,Only mildly amusing...,"I've never seen the TV version of RUMPOLE, so whenmy local library had the cassette version of RUMPOLE A LA CARTEby John Mortimer, I grabbed hold of it to see what all the excitement was about.A LA CARTE features six short stories about Horrace Rumpole,an eccentric British barrister . . . they were mildly amusing, but none of them leaves me wanting to listen to more and/or goout of my way to view the program when next on the tube.Leo McKern's narration, however, was excellent."
4,A Good Read,This booklet tells Lindsey Hall's story of a nine year struggle with bulimia that began in 1967. In the booklet she talks about what led up to her eating disorder and how she overcame it. Chapter 2 of Bulimia A Guide To Recovery by Lindsey Hall and Leigh Cohn is the same story. And is a better read because you get to read the whole book which explains bulimia and how to overcome it and read Lindsey's story at the same time. Read the reviews for that book.
5,Best Investment Book,"This is the first book which demonstrates how to calculate the intrinsic value of a stock. I read through many famous books like The intelligent investor, How to make money in stocks, Only 3 questions that count, How to beat the street, Technical Analysis of Financial Markets etc etc, but non explained me this most basic fact of how to calculate the intrinsic value.This book do require basic mathematical knowledge(+ - * / %) but nothing fancy. If you practice the value calculation twice you will get it how to do it for life. Putting it in excel just makes things far easier."
3,"Great overall understanding of the market, but a little out of date","Morningstar's guide is an excellent reference tool for any beginner investor. In detail, he explains financial statements and what to look for as a value investor. One section takes a step-by-step analysis of each sector of the market: typical breakdown of the businesses, trends & comparables, and what to look for in the sector. This book is dense with relevant information!My only critism is that the book is out of date I.e. written in 2004. The reason it is an issue is because the analysis of financials, technology, and housing have a pre-resession vibe that is disconnected with current views on the sectors. However, the vast majority of the book is timeless, and an excellent guide for understanding corporations in the context of their sectors."
5,"Great, easy to read book.","Does not get too bogged down in details and tells you what you need to know. at the same time, if you want to know the details, this book gives you a helping hand and points you to places where you can become even more knowledgable."
4,This book is more for value investors,"This book is great for getting a basic understanding of what to look for in companies before you invest. However, I have to warn you that the information does not apply to ""non-value"" stocks that well. The chapters in the back of the book are great in terms of breaking down each industry and giving a quick overview of what to look for in each of these sectors. Overall, the book is a good read even if it is more tailored to value investors because a lot of the lessons are universal such as not falling in love with the product or finding companies with large competitive advantages."
5,Hidden Gem/Awesome Intro to Stocks,"It is absurd how good this book is.Sadly, it's also overlooked by many and doesn't seem to get the ""shelf space"" it deserves. I guess in a way that's good --the more knowledgeable the masses become, the harder it is for us folk to capture and exploit pricing inefficiencies in the market (greater fool theory).Anyways, back to the book: It is pure genius -- insightful and easy to read.Dorsey is a CFA who knows stocks like the back of his hand.The best part about this book is when Dorsey goes off and breaks each sector down to its most important metrics for study.For those just beginning to dabble in the market, I can't think of a better introduction -- in fact, if this is your first book on stocks, consider yourself way ahead of the the crowd, who is probably off somewhere reading Suze Orman, buying expensive mutual funds that lag the S&P;, and drinking 5$ latte when they should be buying SBUX and betting on rapid expansion abroad."
4,The Five Rules For Successful Stock Investing,Well written in clear layman's terms. For a more complete help in putting together a strategy for investing would recommend a book on value investing and techinical analysis.
5,GREAT!!!,"This is well written in conversational style language which makes it is easy to get through, yet, at the same time it is extremely detailed. The author has a fun sense of humor too. Many great ideas about what to look for in determining the financial health and value of a company - and how some of these rules change depending on the industry it is in. I took a lot of notes and I consult them often. I love the system they use to determine what a stock should be selling at, before you even look at the stock price. This is what Buffet does too. The book is bloody fantastic! What's also great is many of the things you would normally have to find by searching in the 10k back when this book was written, you can now just do with screeners!"
2,Still don't recieve the mallets I ordered.,I need the mallets for the 18th of October and it's the 14th my auditions depend on me getting these mallets.
4,"Simple, Basic, Elegant","I am an amateur photographer with just a few pictures I consider worthy enough to put in my portfolio. I purchased this for a total of just under $10 (including shipping) and received it VERY promptly. Though it's probably not a portfolio a professional would use, it suits my purposes perfectly. It is all black, simple, and elegant. I would be proud to present this portfolio to a photographer to display my work."
4,Excelente!!,Le recomiendo este producto a todos! Es muy profesional y elegante. Lo unico que no me gusta es que las hojas divisorias son negras pero al final se le pueden quitar. Lo utilice para guardar unos diplomas asi que al final esas paginas negras ni hacen falta. El precio es una verdadera ganga!!
3,"No closure, but otherwise good","This portfolio has no way to close it securely...nothing. Otherwise, it seems to be a good quality. The price is good.I tried to find a closure on Amazon for it, but no luck."
3,Not the best choice to show off your photos,"The book is well-made but the display sheets seem to reduce the color and contrast of photos when viewed through the pages. Not to an unacceptable degree, but I think will choose another option to show off my portfolio and use these books for storage only."
5,Awesome mix of rap and techno to keep you moving all around.,"Jason Nevins has brought along a whole new dance trip with mixing up an old school favorite with some great techno beats. Non-stop dance and movement beats seem to keep you traveling along, while experiencing electronic music with the feeling of breakdancing just a step away."
3,ADD Rom Com,"The movie is fun and it looks great BUT, they wanted everyone in the movie and it never gives any one story enough attention. Every time you settle into one story it has to switch again because there much be seven to nine different stories. They packed the cast, everyone is great, but probably no member has more than a dozen lines except maybe Ashton Kutcher. It has a happy sitcom feel and it will probably be the perfect Friday night movie when you're tired and just want to watch a mindless happy DVD."
1,Sorry cookie cutter excuse for a film,"Just bad in so many ways. Boring. Not funny. Bad music. Full of cliches. A poor copy of Love Actually. Lame kid. Lame lead (Ashton Kutcher? say no more) Obligatory stereotype gay and Hispanic characters. Julia Roberts must have had a mortgage payment or something due for the weak cameo she puts in as a thoroughly unbelieveable soldier on a plane ride that never seems to end (at the beginning of the movie, as the day opens in LA, the captain says there are 6 hours left in the flight; they land and it is nighttime in LA); she sleepwalks through her lines, but undoubtedly got paid many hundreds of thousands of dollars for it. I actually have a weak spot for chick flicks (note reference to the classic Love Actually above), but this one was offensively bad."
2,Can we say boring?,All I can say ---the Bloopers at the end of the movie were the only clips worth watching.
3,Bridget's Review,This was a pretty good movie. I liked how the lives of the characters were woven together. I just wish it was a bit funnier.
1,I had expected Better.....,"I feel as thought this movie was a complete waste of my time. I didn't find it to be at all as good as others had informed me it was. The role of Taylor Swift was basically the only amusement I received from this film. The rest of the movie jumps around way too much with this too huge cast. By the time I'd get slightly interested in someone's story, it would jump to the next couple. I actually found the movie to be quite annoying. What with the cheating, and the break-ups, and the arguing, I hardly found it a film to enjoy with my husband on Valentine's Day. It was a complete waste of time."
4,great comedy,Valentine's day was a fun and at times unpredictable movie about love and unexpected romance. Having a blockbuster cast is a plus. I would watch it again. I actually did watch it two times. Could be one for my collection.
4,Very Cute!,"I think this was a really cute movie. Not sure it would be worth buying, but it was worth watching. I am sure I would watch it again if it was on television."
5,Great!,"Great condition, fast shipping! Would definitely buy from again. I saw this in theaters and I couldn't find it for sale. Once I saw it on here I knew I had to have it."
3,LIGHTWEIGHT BUT LIKEABLE,This film doesn't pretend to be anything other than what it is - a fluffy multi-storied romantic take on one Valentine's Day.
2,Towering Inferno,"This felt like one of those old fashioned disaster movies that was crammed with stars. Unfortunately the movie was a disaster of epic proportions. At first it was fun to spot and name all the stars that popped up. Then as you watch and realize how weak the plot and story is, you end up feeling terribly disappointed at the waste of talent. It seems like they just asked as many actors as they could to appear in the movie to cover a terrible plot. Basically the movie stars Kutcher and Garner, the rest of the actors put in a few days of work each and get 10 or 15 minutes screen time tops. I wish I could have liked this one, but the story is so lame, and the moral messages so heavy handed it really just ruins the picture."
2,Great actors weak story.,"This film isn't short on talent. You have an All Star cast. Gary Marshall is a great director. However the story just isn'tvery strong and that is to bad because the storyline has great potential. I like a lot of films, but this one was disappointing and there's not much more to say about it."
2,Mediocre at best,"Valentine's Day is an RC without the C. Actually, even the R is cliché. This movie is dull for the most part, and as another reviewer posted, the bloopers at the end were the only clips worth watching."
3,Not the Worst.,"It's a good movie, but completely cheesy. I wanted to see it because of all of the great stars that are in it; I think that's the only reason I continued to watch it. Okay, that's a lie. The stories were cute, but Taylor Swift's character was completely annoying! I was so excited to see her act, and I can't say she's bad, but her character, along with Taylor Lautner's, are completely obnoxious. Not a bad film, though."
4,actually very good,I was skeptic by getting this from the redbox for free. To many bad reviews. But I am glad I did. This was very good. From start to finish I loved it. I guess thats what they mean by each there own. jennifer Garner was very good in this movie and so was Jamie Foxx. Queen Latifiah character made no sense I didn't get her part. All in all very good.
2,Ensemble cast in a busy yet weak movie,"With a female cast of Jessica Biel, Jennifer Garner, Anne Hathaway, Julia Roberts, Jessica Alba, and Taylor Swift -this is a guy's dream come true. I'm sure the same goes for females with the male actors. I can handle the occasional ""chick flick"", but this one just had a bad story with annoying characters. Ashton Kutcher and Jamie Foxxx are really lame in this movie, as are most of the characters and situations that are squeezed in to give all the stars enough face time. I thought it was interesting to see Julia Roberts in an army uniform, never thought I would see that. The movie doesn't even really end with that much of a ""feel good"" ending. I thought it was comical that someone as gorgeous as Jessica Biel could possibly be a frustrated single that can't get a date. I don't think Jessica Biel has ever had to go without a date ever. The movie has plenty of attractive people, but the movie itself is pretty bad."
2,Hardly watchable...,"I am not terribly picky over romantic comedies. I usually just grin & bear it and usually end up talking myself into thinking it was a ""pretty-cute movie."" Not this one. With about 20 minutes left in the film, I was getting furious that I had wasted an hour of my life and was contemplating pulling the plug on in. I hung in there but the general vibe of this movie is very sloppy and rushed. The acting, writing, filming, editing...everything. I picture the writer sitting down with a friend and writing it from start to finish over a quickie lunch.I got two light chuckles from this movie, the rest was pretty much awful."
4,Valentine's Day,Valentine's Day single disc widescreen starring numerous big named actors like Ashton Krutcher and Jessica Alba. Would recommend to a friend.
2,Love Actually wannabe,"This movie seemed like an American rip-off of ""Love Actually,"" even to the appearance of the little boy experiencing his first crush. ""Love Actually"" is a much better movie. ""Valentine's Day"" is the kind of movie you'd expect to see on the Hallmark channel; while there's nothing horrible about it, there's nothing particularly engaging or memorable about it, either. Even the plot twists are predictable. And Jessica Biel repeatedly dateless on Valentine's Day? Puh-leeze.You might be drawn to the movie because it's loaded with celebrities. Someone obviously had the clout to get both reputable and currently popular actors on board. But most the stars in the film have done better work on TV or in other films. And if you're looking for a romantic comedy with a predictable plot, there's much more entertainment to be had from a slew of Bollywood films--at least then you'd also get music and dancing."
1,Valentines Drab,"Oh Dear, so much talent in this film and even the dazzling Shirley McLaine cannot save this Titanic as it sinks. Perhaps it's because I am Australian, and we have an English culture base, that I believe this is such a poor imitation of other films that have really delivered. I was bored about 10 minutes in and never recovered my interest, but in a masochistic way I watched it to the end. No stars and no compliments to anyone involved."
1,The Dramedy version of Crash,"The reason that I liken Valentines Day to Crash is all the big name celebs..in a contrived attempt to make it look like our lives are all intertwined in some way. The only difference is that there is no message to Valentines day accept to say that it really shouldn't even exist. Not that I care if it does either way. Regardless of whatever holiday is being exploited in a film like this, this one really left me feeling a little peeved. At who? Julia Roberts, Queen Latifah, Ann Hathaway, Shirley McLain, Patrick Dempsey, Ashton Kutcher, and all the rest of the highly regarded actors. It was only their names being attached to this stinker that made me waste my time and money. Shame on all of you."
1,Homophbic hollywood does it again!,"Gay viewers will have to endure almost 2 hours of gratuitous heterosexual activity, which while completely inoffensive to this reviewer only served to enrage me when the only gay couple in the entire movie have what should have been a heartwarming reunion at the very end of the film reduced to a mere pat on the head...literally! Their love for one another was shown only by one man stroking the hair of the other. No kiss. No embrace. Nothing.This film is rubbish and shows hollywood at its most shamefully intolerant, snivelling and pandering pathetically to a noisy minority."
1,"""Valentine's Day"" tries to be ""Love Actually"" but never spends enough time with any actor to be special","Length:: 5:04 MinsGina from Haunted Flower reviews ""Valentine's Day"" starring just about every pretty Hollywood face: Ashton Kutcher, Jennifer Garner, Anne Hathaway, Topher Grace, Taylor Lautner, Taylor Swift, Jessica Biel, Bradley Cooper, Julia Roberts, Shirley MacLaine, Hector Elizondo, Jessica Alba, Jamie Foxx, Patrick Dempsey, Queen Latifah.....[...]"
1,Another movie to ignore....,A perfect date movie: you'll miss absolutely nothing of merit if you make out in the back row instead of watching the film.
3,decent movie,"This movie has an interesting cast of well known actors. The movie itself was decent, although you should not get your hopes up if you are looking for a deep moving picture. Its fun entertainment. Nothing more."
1,Unwatchable,"This movie is simply atrocious. I recently learned that the average number of days of filming per actor/actress was 3. Let me tell you, it SHOWS.The dialog is written by what seems to be an alien who has learned about human behavior by watching Saved By the Bell episodes.Every single scene of this movie looks like the first take. The only thing more obvious than the plot is the lame attempt at humor, each and every joke comes at you like a freight train. Despite the collective talent of this cast, none of them can save the impossibly cheesy dialog or improve about the hopelessly thin plot lines.Please save yourself the 2 hours and watch a test pattern instead."
1,Terrible Movie,"I have never written a review before. I was compelled to do so for this movie in the hopes that I would stop anyone wasting their money on a truly awful movie. Its terrible. Myself and my partner both went hopeing for a Love Actually or a Notting Hill or something similar. It failed spectacularly. It is poor poor effort. No chemistry, no plot, no laughs. Terrible. If I had to give a positive I would say Taylor Swift was very good.Avoid this film like the plague!!"
4,Something for everyone.,"This is not for those seeking ""highbrow"" entertainment, if you want that, look elsewhere. This is just pure fun and that is what some movies should be for... entertainment and escaping from the real world and it's problems. Sometimes you just want to watch something and not have to overexert the braincells! Life is short, hectic, and full of chaos. You need to let the brain relax and this movie lets you do it. It has a wonderful cast of characters, in a wide range of ages, sure to please everyone. Check it out, just for fun!"
5,HAPPY VALENTINE'S DAY!!!!!,"In honor of today actually being Valentine's Day, I wanted to see this movie. I actually liked it. It is very funny, and very romantic. All the characters are interesting and you care for them. There were a few twists that I didn't expect. This movie is filled with a lot of great actors.On Valentine's Day, we see the lives of different couples and how they deal with love and friendship. Some hearts are broken, and some will find true love on this magical day.Ashton Kutcher plays a florist named Reed Bennett who pops the question to his girlfriend. Jennifer Garner plays a teacher named Julia who falls in love with a doctor who is unfaithful. Anne Hathaway plays a receptionist named Liz who tries to hide the fact that she is a phone sex operator. A kid in Julia's class named Edison tries to send flowers to his Valentine. All this and much more happens on the day of love. I highly recommend VALENTINE'S DAY!!!"
1,"Rent, don't buy","I thought this would be a fun light-hearted movie, but it was a mess of differenct stories and lack lustre performances. I was even disappointed in Jamie Foxx, and I think he is a top notch actor in other films. Taylor swift was extra ditsy in this, and I don't think it helped her aspiring movie career. I would recommend renting it from Redbox for $1 before you decide to purchase it."
3,Fun and Entertaining,"I saw this movie with three friends and we all enjoyed it thoroughly. We even laughed out loud at some parts of the movie. I really cannot see that this movie is any worse than the other dozen romantic comedies released each year. If nothing else, you get to see a lot a stars that you like in the same place."
4,Very cute and a ton of big names.,"Entertaining, light romantic comedy. Fun to keep seeing stars pop up on the screen. Similar to New Years Eve. Wonder how many other holidays G. Marshall has directed...."
4,Excellent chick flick,"I know a lot of times when there are movies with several big stars in it the expectations are really high and they dont always work. I however, love this movie. I love the different stories and how they intersect. I am a sucker for a good romantic comedy and this movie does not disappoint."
3,"ok, but not as I remember it.",I must've been in a very romantic mood when I first saw this movie...thought I would recapture the feeling by watching it again..little disappointed. I will give it another chance.
2,Too many couples,"There were too many couples to have any depth with any of them. If the story had limited itself to three or four couples, then maybe there would have been some connection, but with the story going back and forth between so many people, I didn't feel anything for any of them."
3,Valentine's Day,Valentine's Day was a quirky cute movie. Loved the variety of actors in this movie and would watch it again.
1,stupid is as stupid does...,"This movie had very low humor. Taylor Swift's character annoyed me so much I had to turn it off. I was really disappointed when Reed and Morely did not get married. Over all this movie was a big waste of time and the only characters in this movie I liked were Ann Hathaway and Topher Grace. They were so cute together. But, honestly save yourself the money and time to watch it."
2,Star Studded Cast,"You can't get really too excited about Valentine Day's from a stand point of creativity. It is your basic romantic comedy with the ups and downs of relationships. The plot is a little unwielding, focusing on what seems like two thousand people living in Los Angeles. It tries to tie in a bunch of storylines into one neat package and flip flops all over the place. That being said, the film is enjoyable as mindless entertainment. The cast puts forth maximum effort (though Julia Roberts seems to be there only as a thank you to director Gary Marshall for making her career in Pretty Woman) in the paper-thin plot and they are quite likable. Ashton Kutcher and Jennifer Garner stand out as does Jamie Foxx with many other recognizable talents offering solid support."
4,Chick Flick,"I love this movie, I saw it in theaters on valentine's day with my best friend and we fell in love with the movie. I love how all the characters are combined in some way or another. I love how obnoxious Taylor Swift is, she needs to stick to singing.. Curveball at the end.."
2,Wasn't the best,Out of all of the Valentines movies this wasn't the best out there. It was just placing celebrity with celebrity. Too many story lines and some were NOT worth it.
3,Many stories to follow,"It can be a cute movie, but they are trying to cram too many stars together that it falls a bit short."
2,lame,"boring movie, not very good acting and slow moving. overall not entertaining. I was hoping for a feel good chic movie but I was disappointed."
5,I Loved It!!,"Awesome cast fell in love with every story. It showed that love has no certain age, race or gender. Loved it"
3,Anyone else have this problem?,I was wondering if anyone else bought this product to find that there were no extras? From the product description it's supposed to at least have deleted scenes but mine has nothing but the movie by itself. The main reason I buy movies is for the extras so I'm kind of mad.
4,Lovely!,"With such a good cast, there were going to be some highlights and lowlights with this movie:- Fun. Lots of different stories to keep your engaged or interested. Some will spark interest, some will not.- Cute. The endings were nicely crafted to give you warm feelings of love.- Actor/actress performance were collectively good, but with a few rotten tomatoes. I will say that most of individuals involved in the cast did a good job. However, there were a few that just left a bad taste in my mouth. They contributed almost absolutely nothing to the movie.Solid love movie with a few flaws. Bearable though. Watch with your family, significant other, and friends"
4,good movie,This movie had some of my favorite actors and actresses. I don't think I have ever seen so many big actors in one movie. It wasn't the best movie but I enjoyed it.
3,A date movie,"This movie is as advertised - a cute date movie, nothing more, nothing less. The acting, plots, and everything about the movie are shallow and mushy. That being said, it does work as something to watch with your significant other when you just want to feel good about your relationship. Recommended for that purpose alone - otherwise, this isn't anything special."
1,A mess with stars is still a mess!,"Something like this makes you wonder what all of the stars thought of the script. Remember when you could go to any movie with your favorite movie star and walk away satisfied. Even if the movie wasn't great, you felt the star had not let you down. So much for class, ethics, morals or tastes today. You can't trust anyone to only do quality movies any more. A mess like this makes you miss Love Boat, or Love, American Style -- nifty short episodes where true love finds a way...and you didn't have to be gay to enjoy it.Save your money. My wife and I got this free on a Red Box coupon and I went to bed early. She fast-forwarded most of the movie and said we were robbed. Getting it for free was still too high a price!"
3,Pretty long,"This movie is pretty long, but it's sort of cute. The disasters and issues that can happen on Valentine's Day are copious. I was bored at times."
4,Surprisingly enjoyable,"A star-laden film containing several interconnected plotlines involving people either in love, falling in love, falling out of love, or wanting love. It is Valentines Day (surprise!) and the personal lives of multiple people are affected in different ways. At times, funny, other times touching, the film was effective at weaving together many different storylines without short-changing any of them, or being difficult to follow. A fun film for an evening out with your significant other, or, if you don't have someone, see it alone."
3,"For so many stars, it's a little slow","Okay, I HAD to see this movie.Valentine's Day is my favorite holiday.I love romantic comedies.Then all the cast - geez, so many stars!But, the movie was a little boring, to be honest.I liked it, and yes, I'd watch it again, but it doesn't have anyof the staying power (Ie - want to watch repeatedly) of movies like""Sleepless in Seattle"". They could have done SO much more with the stories.I would have loved to have the movie be longer and more interesting.If you can get it really cheaply, or collect movies with a certain starin them, then go ahead. Otherwise, wait for a sidewalk sale or penny sale!Shame on the director for doing so little with so much!"
2,Did I miss something,"The film just seemed to to be a Mish-mash of story lines very loosely linked. Hard to relate, connect and understand the relationships of the characters. It was fun to watch and count all the recognizable faces in the film but nothing else was valuable."
2,sorry to say this was poor,i had decent hopes for this movie but there was no emotion in the whole film. a subpar effort in which i blame the screenplay .not worth the time
4,"Not highly original, but entertaining","Valentine's Day is the interaction between a series of people on Valentine's Day. A bit ""off beat,"" it's interesting enough to hold ones attention without being so deep you can't stop to pop the popcorn. Fun, relaxing, enjoyable."
5,Valenyine's Day,This was a very entertaining movie. It had so many great actors. I which there were more movies like this one.
4,Great movie,Wasn't sure if this movie would really be any good because usually ones with so many good actors turn out to be flops. Not this one!
1,"I was so hopeful, but this was a disappointment.","With the cast of actors, I was really excited about this movie. (In spite of poor reviews, I was ever hopeful! Alas, I should have paid attention to the reviews.)Anne Hathaway's character was not only completely unbelievable, she was a morally bankrupt, sickening character -- not the girl you want to root for, hoping she will find her true love. Topher Grace is usually intriguing to watch; he was mostly just annoying in this movie. Ashton Kutcher's acting wasn't too bad, but his character was so pathetic, he was difficult to watch, as well. Jessica Biel, Jennifer Garner, Patrick Dempsey - all yucky characters and ho-hum acting. I could go on, but won't. The only redeeming personality in this movie was George Lopez' supporting role. His was the only character that was somewhat noble and praiseworthy. My overall response to this movie is just, ""Yuck!"" ~ Debbie"
5,Thought it was great!,"I thought this movie was fun! It really did have a little something for everyone. I loved the twists and that there were so many different story lines going on at the same time. I'm very happy with the movie, especially since I gave it to a lot of people before I even had a chance to watch it!"
5,256k memory card,This product is so cool.I might just get 2 of them.I wish I had one to save every game that I have. I have 14 games so I guess I have to buy 14 memory cards. Memory cards are so easy to use. I just love using them. This is one of the best brands you can buy!
2,"Entertaining, but shoddy research","This is yet another of the many books claiming to identify J the R. This one focuses on a wierd person named Stephenson or D'Onston, his first name changes from Robert to Rosslyn. The case seems to be based on hearsay, and the subject's own ego. He repeatedly wrote giving his theories to the media and police, and really anyone who would listen. The theory is largely unsubstantiated and the author does little to make us believe in his theories. He just says that all the others are wrong and he's right. Great ego, less great book."
2,"Please, wake me up when it's over.","Okay, I got it! Michelle was a bad lady, full of deceitful and murderous thoughts. She's the kind of lady we all love to hate. Good true crime story. But, reading this book is a lot like spending all day with my aunt Helen in Queens. I kept waiting for the author to write something creative to help move the story along, but it never happened. Bore, bore, bore! I just finished reading a similar story about another lady who conspired to murder her husband with her boyfriend (Dale Hudson's Dance of Death) and it was like riding a roller coaster. I couldn't put Hudson's book down. But with Fleeman's book, I couldn't wait to put it down. I assure you I won't be telling my friends about this book. Hey, I'm a generous guy, but two stars is all you'll get from me on this one."
2,Newspaper Read,"This story could have been an interesting read but it wasn't. It was like a story boringly told by a narrator. Terrible read. It was not like a true story book at all. The intrigue,suspense and mystery were missing. I felt like I was reading a bunch of articles clumped together. It was very boring,I had to skip many pages at a time to get through the book it was terribly boring. Very Disappointed."
2,Same old story.....same average writing,"I would never want to make light of someone's murder and the pain their family suffered. But, having said that, I have to wonder if this story really warranted a book.Unfortunately, it's a too common tale of a spouse (in this case a moderately attractive wife and psychologist in desperate need of a facial waxing) gets her military boyfriend to murder her military husband for his life insurance.The story is certainly more interesting than the writing would indicate. The writer really drags out each bit of (sometimes) minor and seemingly unimportant information.If you like a good true crime read there are much better ones out there. If you are looking to pass the time without wasting too much brain power this one works."
3,Good but could have been better,"This book could have been written better- too much like a newspaper article. Still can't believe how incredibly stupid this woman was to think she could get away with it ! Especially with her education. She thought she was smarter than the cops and they would just leave her alone. And didn't she know that once something is on your computer, it's there for life? How ignorant !"
4,Tragic story,This book is excellent. All I read is true crime and this was really good. This women is cold I can not believe how she manipulates those in her life. I highly recommend those who read true crime does miss this one.
4,Great Book... Tragic Murder!,"Easy read... I did not want to put this book down! Not a book for children, and early teens to read! The writing keeps the interest of the reader, and the story is truely heartbreaking."
3,OK but still worth buying,I was inbetween 3 and 4 on this. It is a really good reference but it doesn't really give that much information for any of the symbols that it lists and it's not quite a complete list but still worth buying.
4,Very comprehensive in general,"This book is a scholarly work and contains many good references. It is easy to use and comprehensive. This book does not address some of the symbols of alchemy and ceremonial magic, so you may have to look elsewhere for those. Also, hieroglyphs are not, in general, covered (but there are some). I liked this book and recommend it."
4,"Great, Solid Rock album","Wow. Had this album a while back, lost it somewhere, and just bought it again. This is Prayer Chain at their best. From their stirring and thoughtful lyrics (something you don't always or ussually find in christian music) to their rythyms this album is golden."
4,"Organizations, leadership, values","This book is not loaded with facts. It is loaded with thought provoking challenges about our country and the people who lead America's companies and other organizations. Amos doesn't preach, but he knows where the answers are. If you want to give a CEO, VP or other senior level professional something that's easy to read and can better the businesses and lives they affect, consider this book."
5,Everything I was looking for,This book is great. Helpful tips told in an inspiring and delightful way. Roy Peter Clark does an amazing job giving authors of every kind suggestions on how to improve upon their natural abilities. Very enjoyable.
4,Well written and easy to digest,Well written and easy to digest. I love the idea of these tips as tools in a toolbox rather than rules to follow.
4,A joy to read,"The purchase of this book was a very good thing. It arrived on time, was everything they said it would be and was very affordable."
3,Not Comprehensive,"The author labels his fifty strategies ""tools."" Like the items in my toolbox, some of Mr. Clark's tools are very useful and others are not. Some of the strategies or tools need explanation while others are obvious, even to a beginner like me. And, like my own toolbox this book is not as organized as I would wish. If I have a problem, I can see myself rummaging around in this book hunting for the right tool to fix it."
3,A Casino in your Hand,"This game is alot of fun to play and give off a pretty good atmosphere imitation within. However, the detail could be a little better & the character choices could have more of a variety to them. All in all it it a good game...Thanks"
4,Standard Casino Fare,"Game is very easy to play. You have a wide variety of Casino based games you can participate in. Game play is fairly realistic, and challenging. Graphics are very good and crisp. A good game to buy if you have a lot of idle time like flying to a far away destination where you need to kill some time."
4,Good Distraction,I only understand about half of the games you can play on here but what I've been able to do has been fun. The game is larger than I expected which is great. It's a good way to pass the time if you're feeling bored.
4,A Must Read!!,"This is a story of four generations of women named Dorinda and the things they go through. It's one of the best stories I've read, and I read A LOT. It's not your typical love story; things aren't always like that and this book illustrates that very well. I won't tell the story, but I'll give a little insight as to what it's about.It takes one generation to make it,One generation to lose it,One generation to talk about it--And one to make it again!Four generations, four stories. If you enjoy romances, you'll love this one."
1,Zero Stars,"It remains mysterious that humans are held to be the cause of any kind of phenomenon that is otherwise unexplainable within a uniformitarian framework. The mammoths went extinct precisely where they'd have had no food supply to build their population to such high levels, nor indeed to support so much as a herd.In other words, they didn't go extinct because of conditions that exist today, but they did go extinct due to natural conditions. And not due to fictional bands of ravenous human hunters.This book should appeal to the knee-jerk reactionaries who sanctimoniously hand down judgments about the lifestyles of the rest of us. This book is worth less than fossilized mammoth dung."
1,Fine fairy tale but scientific rubbish,"What a disppointment. The author, a geologist, falls flat in this book. He strays into areas of expertise with grand claims and zero proof. He does not refer to his ideas as theories but as fact. Aside from the joy ride around good questions, the book is filled with extreme political correctness... Why are SUV's, Republicans, and present day humans always the ones that are to blame for extinctions that happened thousands of years ago (now you get an idea of what light that this book was written in). Pure rubbish as a science book. Great for ""politically correctness"" fans."
3,Not my favorite,"I found this book to be kind of dull actually. The characters are broad and somewhat unrealistic, and I don't know that Snyder has found an effective way to combine fantastic elements with a realistic world.This is a good-hearted book, and might be worth a read as an afternoon's entertainment, but it didn't hold the magic for me that it seemed to hold for other reviewers. It reminds me a little bit of the works of Ruth Chew, which all center around kinds and magical objects.I would recommend Beatrice Gormley's ""Mail Order Wings"" above this for a book about an adolecent who takes flight. If you're looking for a good fantasy story involving children and magical adventures, I think ""James and the Giant Peach"" or ""The BFG,"" both by Roald Dahl, would be more satisfying."
3,Good Fairy Tale Twist,"So, I read The City and The City by China Mieville and didn't like it. But I could see that the author had interesting ideas and wrote well. I decided to try another one of his books, that being King Rat. I ended up liking it. Although I would say I am not an experimental music buff, and I don't know anything about the culture, I found the book interesting. It was good to be immersed into a new world. I wish I had been immersed into it more. Usually, I find books to be too long. This one, I was wanting more details. Write a sequel or something in that same environment, and I'll buy it!As for storyline, I liked it. But, I always end up comparing to past books, and I just kept thinking how much I liked The Fox Woman by Kij Johnson. But, I prefer sensual books to gritty. It is just a matter of preference.I will definitely try another one of Mr. Mieville's books, most likely Perdido Street Station. I think he is interesting, and that I might find one of his books to be gold."
3,3 and a half stars,"""King Rat"" is pretty good for a first novel. It's a fun, fast read and Mieville's writerly skills are apparent. I loved the way he painted his neo-Goth portrait of London's darker side, but the story-line is a little thin and the characters are kind of flat.It did whet my appetite for his other books, which I'll soon read.Perdido Street StationIron CouncilThe Scar"
3,Citizen Rat,"Alright, so this novel is no Perdido Street Station , but it was Mieville's first book and it is a gripping, well-written piece in its own right. The same urban decay and chaos that made Perdido a masterpiece is already evident in King Rat. However, while Perdido was layered, complicated, intense, and grand in it's scope, King Rat is more of a one idea exploration. Still,its well worth the read and hasn't stopped my high expectations for the next Mieville novel. Here's an odd recommendation: Read Neal Gaiman's ""American Gods"" and King Rat sequentially - the books share an important yet incidental character..."
2,Early work - unimpressive,"I am a HUGE fan of China Mieville. I have read Perdido Street Station, The Scar and Iron Council. Those were GREAT books, but this is not in the same league.The book was interesting at the beginning, but there was not enough going on to keep me interested. I forced myself to finish it, hoping that it would get better. I would not recommend this book to anyone, since he has written far better novels."
2,...not by a long shot...,"Sorry, folks, but this book does not hold up. It's starts off with a fast pace and characters and a story that just sucks you in. But as more (annoying, pretentious) characters are added...well it goes down hill. This was a chore to finish. The writer is clearly trying to appeal to the hip, cool, gothic youth and is kills what should have been a great book."
2,"Good, but not compelling","I read ""The Scar"" as my first taste of Mieville's work, and was blown away. I have to say that this work is not up to the level of his later work, but still evokes interest and images.While dark, it did not grab me by the throat the way his other work did. And I felt very little association or empathy for the characters.This is a good book, but worth reading more as a glimpse of where the author started from than as a work itself."
3,"Good read, but not his best","I found ""King Rat"" to be another creative and entertaining world created by China Mieville. Unlike many of his other books, which take place in fantasy cities based on London, this one is set in the real London, but one that normal people never see. Like his others, it's an epic life-or-death struggle against a seemingly invincible enemy. I enjoyed the book but did not find it quite a good nor as engrossing as his best, like ""Perdido Street Station"". Worth a read."
3,It was okay,"Here we have a tolerably competent but not remarkable first effort from an author who later produced great things. The story and characterization are uneven. Things move too quickly at times; there's a lot left unjustified. Too many elements are too obviously derived from old fairy-tales. Heavy use of Cockney slang may be daunting for some readers, but I had no problem with it. The meaning is usually clear from context. The late 1990s Young Urban fascination with Jungle drum & bass music has dated badly - it makes the characters seem trite and phony, which would be brilliant if it was intentional, but I'm not sure it is. It may be unfair to compare this book with Mieville's later work, but such comparison is unavoidable. My advice is to skip this one and go to Perdido Street Station. ""King Rat"" is only of interest to fans of this author; as a novel in its own right it does not withstand the test of time."
3,"Good, not great",Interesting read and easy to get through. The story was well written and the descriptions of London gave it an added dimension. The ending...eeehhhh.
2,"Apathetic, shallow, and not at all ground -breaking",What a ho-hum of a book this was. I was waiting the entire time for some sort of depth or astounding revalation only to find that the author drivels on with all the writing talent of a 10 year old hastily tossing together something for the teacher.Not at all a book I'd reccomend to anyone who is *truly* looking for a unique read.
1,"Great story, dissappointing execution","Great premise, great start....then we get the language of the gutter in it's fullness. This is not a book for kids, and if you are not into bad language that jumps off the page, neither are you! I loved Unlundun and decided to try this one....not the reader friendly book I imagined. The story is great, a wonder and brilliant in some areas...but there isn't a need to drive a story with such a good premise off the road with bad language. Sorry.....but it would have been a great book with out it!!"
4,Very compelling story,Chiana Melville did a fantastic job with this story. All the characters were fleshed out to the extent they needed to be. The story flowed extremely well with events seeming to occur naturally without being forced.I would recommend this book wholeheartedly.
4,My 100-word book review,"First novel by inventive left-wing fantasy author China Mieville, in which young Saul Garamond comes to terms with his true identity as a half-rat superhero, after the murder of his father. Set in the shadowy, seamy underbelly of London, this novel is also about the esoteric world of drum-and-bass music. The characterisation is fairly flat, and there really should be a bit more of a background to Saul; King Rat is not quite in the same league as the Bas-Lag novels, but still displays a brilliant imagination, and a rather anarchic mix and match approach which I find very stimulating."
3,"Duke Rat, at best","I really wanted to like this book. I'd heard great things about Perdido Street, and the description sounded so interesting...I like urban fantasy, I like tight writing, and I like jungle, so perfect, right?So wrong. It's not that Mieville can't write -- he can. And the first few chapters were really good. But as soon as the plot began to develop, it because sadly predictable, leading to a disjointed ""climax"" I'd seen coming a mile off. Still, the worst part was the music. Other reviewers have charitably guessed that the drum &bass/jungle bits (of which there are many) are more interesting or make more sense if you like the music. Unfortunately, the opposite is true. If you appreciate or make drumn & bass, the musical passages come off as contrived, hysterical, and eye-rollingly embarassing.I'm sure he meant well, but jungle just isn't something you write about that way.Still, Mieville shows promise, so I'll read Perdido Street next."
3,rat tale,"King Rat is a fun read whose fantasy element is skilfully worked. Mieville has an obvious love of London's dark underside and his other sources. The problem with fantasy is that you have to believe the fantasy and not just the story. Mostly Mieville makes this leap successfully. But where the book doesn't quite succeed is in its violence (I prefer the play on dark folk tales rather than the more graphic fights) and in its passion for Jungle music - the latter is fine if you share it and makes a nice background for the modern setting of rat tales, but may be just a little too much for non-fans.But, if you're looking for a bleak, tricksy, dirty and easy to read exploration of London's real or imagined underground, this has more than a good share of thrills in story-telling and imagination for this genre."
2,Ok..ish,It's very hard to get into a story based on rats. There are some tiresome stetches of narative that could be lost.
5,I couldn't put this book down,I was instantly drawn into the cleverly woven storyline. The novel takes several unexpected twists and turns that really keeps your interest through to the very last page. I found myself wanting more when I got to the end. The main characters are very vivid and likable. Thomas does a fine job of creating real life mysteries that drive your imagination. I absolutely enjoyed this book and recommend it highly.
2,mildly entertaining,"The book started out pretty good, interesting storyline with the potential for a great read. Unfortunately, the story wandered all over the place and the ending left me shaking my head wondering what the heck that was all about. Fortunately, it was a quick read.."
3,"There are many better Rich Mullins works, get them first","While strong for a first album, Rich is still trying to find his style on this CD. After writing for Amy Grant et al for so long, he is unsure of his style and it shows. Not his worst work, but still, no way am I going to give this the same rating as his better albums.The best song is ""Elijah"", but the better version of ""Elijah"" is the reworked one on ""Songs""."
3,Worth it for Rich's best song,"I'll be blunt--most of these songs are what we dread when we think of 80s CCM. Save the lyrics, there is not much going for most of these songs. The one exception, and the one song that makes this CD worth having is ""Elijah"". Rich's most heartfelt, soul bearing song was his personal favorite and, in my opinion, his best. ""Elijah"" was rereleased on the 'Songs' CD, but it was over-produced and sounds like a studio exec asked him to make it ""hip"" or something. In any event get this CD, as it contains Rich's favorite song and his best."
2,I love you Laura but you went too far,This albun is the crescendo of Laura Branigan's perverse(at times) experimenatlism Her courageous pushing of boundaries is what I most loved about her and for years I forgave her for this album. But I decided I can't any more. This album was the first part of a two part experiment(next .album- Touch part 2)The basic experimental issue: is it possibly to overpower absolutely trash songs and music with beautiful singing. Can you detract from the obvious lack of ANY serious investment of time or energy from the song writers with the ultimate use of your vocal chords. The latter is certain there her singing and use of her voice richness is at it's peak. For years she almost succeeded. The test tubes incubated over the years but the final results on on the data pad. Didn't work. I love her ability to try anything as long as I have some idea what or WHY. That's what I could never quite get on this one. Bad burn from the bunsen burner.
5,A superb book,"More than met my expectations. The author, who is very much an intellectual, manages to write in a style that engages the average reader without seeming to ""talk down"". His love for the Eucharist and fascination with all he learned in studying its various celebrations is interesting and, for me, makes the experience much more meaningful."
1,Point de Vue,"I have been kept waiting for over 4 months for this subscription to start. Whenever I call I get a runaround about talking to the wrong person, switched to another department, etc. If I had know it would be like this I could have gone directly to the magazine and had my first issue in a matter of weeks. I would never subscribe to a magazine again through Amazon"
1,If you like junk...,"I normaly love Bratz. I normaly don't mind fashion 'errors'. I normaly enjoy mixing and matching, but this time MGA has taken it one step too far. Ok, lets look at this perspectively, she has green pants (that have elastic bottoms with lace) and an orange belt over it. Triple ew! Next, she's got an ok shirt thats black with a pink and orange striped scarf. It resembles dog puke. Now she has an adorable skirt and they just had to ruin it by adding an ugly pair of ankle tights with rainbow stripes. Yeah, the accessories are fine but to make up for it they gave her NEON (yes, N-E-O-N) high-lights. If anyone thought that looks good, you need a reality check! And no, I didn't make a mistake when I said five stars for educational, because it teaches you how to ruin a perfectly fine doll. At least the rest of the Tokyo-a-go-go dolls are partially matching!! Please, I am only trying to do you good when I say this, DON'T BUY THIS DOLL!!!!!!!!"
2,"Okay, but the other Tokyo dolls were better","Fianna is okay in the Tokyo Bratz, but why did they put so much yarn in her hair?! One day I was playing and a bunch of yarn came out of the hair style; this doll's hair is terrible but the accessories are awesome! Also one of her feet pegs is coming lose, I mean right when I opened the doll her feet fell off revealing a crooked Peg on her leg! I do not suggest this doll. Yasmin is very cool though!"
1,poor quality,I have owned this product now for a little over a year and I have been through 4 wa302 instrument cables. They are cheap chords and also very expensive. I would never buy another shure system again.
2,Not agree with this,"As you show in the picture I recived a completely different product, not like a picture I don't why.I ordered according to the picture but you sent me another product, for example without antennas external only internals.So I pay like a PGX14, but you sent me a PG14.I'm not agree with this purchase"
2,Worked with modification,"Had to epoxy a couple pieces together because they wouldnt stay... Liitle too much cheap plastic, but its doing the job now"
4,For the student without a teacher,"This book is excellent for someone new to programming and/or Oracle PL/SQL. The book contains one lab after another to allow the true beginner to practice concepts. Cursors, exceptions, procedures, functions, packages and triggers are all covered. Keep in mind that this is not a reference book. To learn the topics that are covered in this book you will have to work the labs. Combining this book with a reference book will set you on the right foot. As of this writing (April 20, 2000), the website for the book ( ) was not up so I can't comment on that."
1,Poorly structured,"If you like a structured lesson, then you will find this confusing. Usually you expect a lesson then examples and labs. In this book the lessons are mixed in the labs. Lessons often use something that isn't covered until a later chapter, but they don't mention this. This book looks to be rushed too early to publishing. If you are OK with a scattered instruction method, then this is the book for you. Unfortunately there aren't many alternatives to this book."
2,ORACLE PL/SQL,"Ok the content was OK to get a working knowledge of PL in a hurry. It was almost impossible to have to go to the web look up the author at the PHP site simply to download files you needed to complete the ""interactive exercises"". On top of that you had to then compile the database to be used. They took the shortcut that ruined the entire experience. By the time you find what you are looking for on the web, you have lost your train of thought. A lot of typos cost me a lot of time trying to figure out why I was not getting the same answer. I would really appreciate a refund on this one to be honest which I would never persue. A CD Would have made this book and excellent learning experience. I think the corporatation's decision to not include one ruined the author's attempt to write a good book."
1,An exercise in frustration,"I bought this in hoping to find a PL/SQL book that could give me a real life lab exercise. I gave up on this book. The examples would sometime refer to advanced topics not discussed. There were errors. The exercises did not appear to be kitchen tested before the book was published. I am still looking for a good PL/SQL book that has good interactive lab exercises, if you find one please let the rest of us know."
1,"Good idea, terrible execution","The idea of an interactive workbook is good, but this book is so riddled with errors, undefined terms, and grammatical/language errors as to be an embarrassment to the publisher. If you're going to publish a book by people whose first language isn't English, then make sure you get a very good copy editor and proofreader."
2,Almost Horrible,"Grammar mistakes that lead you to wonder exactly what they are attempting to say, not systematic in explaining all the parameters/options of a command/function, and only skimming the surface of many concepts. Save your money, there's got to be a better book out there..."
5,Great little mouse,"I ordered this for my four-year-old, who couldn't seem to master our wireless mouse. When I first looked at it, I had some doubts, because it's not dramatically smaller than our other mouse. Nevertheless, the first time I plugged it in, my daughter instantly got the hang of it and I was astounded."
2,Right size but poor functionality,"This mouse is the perfect size for my four year old's hands, but the pointer on the screen jumps around and is incredibly imprecise relative to the mouse movement. This is a big frustration for a child just learning how to use a mouse. The old full size Dell el cheapo mouse this was to replace is too large relative to my daughter's hand, but functioned much much better."
4,Chester Creek Kids' Optical Tiny Mouse review,My 5 year old grand daughter was having trouble clicking the buttons on a regular size mouse. She needed something smaller and this turned out to be perfect for small hands.
3,Good Fun,"At 35 tracks, 'Our Live Album...' is more than just a live album; it's practically the definitive collection of Reel Big Fish's greatest hits. In between the vulgar, arrogant, and generally hilarious banter, even a complete stranger to RBF is sure to find plenty of songs to enjoy over and over. The album sounds great, seamlessly integrating recordings from a half-dozen or so live shows. While this allows the band to create a ""best of"" collection of ""Suburban Rhythm"" versions, it also causes the who experience to run a little long. And when the DVD documents the band dubbing guitar and horns right over the original live recordings, you have to wonder how close to an actual RBF show the whole thing actually sounds.Standout tracks: Beer, Take On Me, S.R. (The Many Versions Of)"
5,REEL BIG FISH RULES!!!!,"I'm from Quito, Ecuador in South America and the reason i write you is to tell to the world that this live CD is the best, you need to buy it. I love Reel Big Fish and i'm proud to own this CD/DVD. You'll not be disappointed!!!"
5,Find out if TM is worth the money for you.,"Even though this book is now 35 years old, it is still the best and most inspiring introduction to Transcendental Meditation I know of. The author makes it clear that it is impossible to learn the actual technique from this or any other book, but, as a long time meditator myself, I know that most people I've given the book to have wanted to take an in-person course after reading it.That's because it reveals in a very accessible way the deep principles underlying the mechanics of the technique rather than just reciting a series of testimonials. The technique is worth the time and money needed to take the personal course of instruction, and this book will help you determine if it's for you. It covers everything from the practical benefits of increased energy, productivity, clarity of mind, resistance to disease, harmonious relationships, and world peace to an understanding of how one incredibly simple process could have such an impact."
4,Growing on me more every day...,"The first time I listened to this I wasn't sure what to make of it, but the more I listen the more I like it. I really liked Escondida, this album is a little different, on a lot of songs her voice sounds like an instrument. Sometimes she's all over the place and some of the songs get a little tiresome. But what a voice it is, the songs are beautiful and interesting, overall a pleasure to listen to. Ms. Holland's music evokes many styles and era's, but I think she's more and more sounding like herself."
4,Best alterna-fem album of the year so far,"Cat Power and Neko Case didn't do it for me this year, but this album by Jolie Holland is solid. It's by far, the best thing Jolie Holland has done. Unlike her previous albums, the musicianship is tight and free of excess. Holland has gotten more sophisticated and adventurous both lyrically and melodically and it suits her.The album has a very dreamy, hallucinatory quality. It's like taking The Little Willies album - an album this year that's pretty boring - and adding opium. And that's a good thing.I don't do drugs anymore, but I can remember that music like this was - like Billie Holiday or Dan Hicks albums - the perfect drug companion. And maybe that's why I like this album so much. It makes me a bit nostalgic.The more I think about it, the more this sounds like a young, fresh female Dan Hicks. Except Ms. Holland is a little easier on the ears and her lyrics are less straightforward. Recommended for fans of Tom Waits, Joe Henry, Bjork and Andrew Bird."
5,The music I needed to hear today,"I loved Escondida and Catalpa, and I couldn't wait for Springtime Can Kill You. It arrived in my CD player a week ago and hasn't left. This music is now in my bloodstream; it's food for the ears. Crush in the Ghetto, Springtime Can Kill You, and Stubborn Beast are instantly addictive."
3,Uneven and The Same,"I love Jolie Holland. But on this album (like on Catalpa) the sound quality and pitch are uneven. It sounds like recordings from various performances, rather than a studio recording. That could be good, if done well ... The songs are too much the same, and many are too much like the Escondida & Catalpa songs. I think she can do much better than this."
4,It grows on you.,"First listen was ok. I had a little trouble understanding the lyrics, good sound though. Second time around was much better. She is very good and I think she has a great future."
4,Noteworthy Effort,"This release truely represents the proggy sound of the 70's. Noncommercial, surreal, impetuous, strange, ethereal, offbeat; all adequate adjectives to describe the five tracks on this CD. Hammond Organ, VCS-3 synth, piano and soaring vocals. Dissonance mixed with symphonic melodies, polyrhythmic structures. The sound is very reminiscent of King Crimson's ""Lark Tongue in Aspic"" or ""Lizard"". To some degree this CD also reminds me of the first Flash album recalling Tony Kaye's keyboard passages and Colin Carter's high pitched vocals. The lyrics are somewhat dated and goofy but the music stands on its own. From a composition standpoint I would give it a 3 to 3.5 out of 5. Production quality is excellent on this remaster, 5 out of 5. Overall, ""The Sleeper Wakes"" is a noteworthy effort and progressive rock enthusiasts should seek this one out especially for the epic ""What Is - Is What""."
2,"A nice match to collection, but I'm not crazy about the rug.","I recently remodeled my son's room with the entire collection of the InStyle Home Collection Sports Theme. I went as far as painting the walls to match the sheets (pinstrips and sports ball). I was very happy with everything except the rug. The size is okay, I didn't expect it to be large since I did measure my space before I ordered it. I like the design since it matches the rest of the room, however I've vacuumed it a few times and now it looks older than old. I'm so disappointed in the quality of the rug. I don't think its worth the money. I ended up seeing another similiar rug at our local store and bought it. It matches just fine and it was 1/4 of the cost and looks like it was made much better. I wouldn't have bought it if there was a review for me to read when I ordered mine. NOT WORTH THE MONEY. $15 tops."
2,not what I expected...,This rug has no backing (not skid resistant) and the color's were much different than appeared. However I will say they handled my return wonderfully and provided a full refund promptly.
3,"Family, Love, and Revenge.","Dara Singh and Anita star in this 1969 classic about family, love, and revenge from the justly well-regarded old-time Bollywood director Radhakant. Dara Singh and Anita star in this 1969 classic about family, love, and revenge from the justly well-regarded old-time Bollywood director Radhakant."
4,Good song,"This is a really good song. I really like the Rolling Stones. Although, the only album I have is Forty Licks. They should make a Forty Licks two or something so we can get more of their great songs."
2,Very Beginner Material,"I had hopes that this book would be for Pro's since that is what it says it is. It is very high level and uses 2003 samples like Task Vision and Issue Vision. So none of the topics it covers are related to .NET 2.0 except how to upgrade these to work with .NET 2.0. Which means open them up in Studio 2005.The web service material was also very high level. Nothing on WSE at all. Which makes building web services much easier.Nothing on Mobile SQL or SQL CE in the disconnected data section.Nothing on SharePoint and office 12, although not much is available. But office IBF is history.No real .NET 2.0 coverage at all, none.The architecture samples used are very very high level. And kind of pointless.I gave this book a 2, because the material that is in it is good for beginners to get an overview of what smart client and SOA are, but it is useless in the real work and has nothing much to do with .NET 2.0."
2,Poor,"This book is apparently ""for .Net Developers, designers and architects who want to build next=generation solutions"". It promised to ""use a practical, example driven approach"".Well, it doesnt do any of the above. This book gives a rather poor introductory narrative of Smart Clients. I wouldnt recommend this book for a developer who wants to get a good idea on how to build Smart Clients."
3,Misleading title,"I have read this book, I'd say that is a good book if you're trying to get an idea of what a Smart Client is, and a little bit of what SOA might be etc. After reading this book, you can go and talk to your peers about what is a Smart Client(those without a big inside in the Smart Clients area). Plus there are some good architectural advices on some chapters.But if you want to have a deep technical understanding on some of the tough questions on SmartClients, I'd say this book is a little bit too ""For Beginers"" one."
5,Finally a useful book on smart clients,"Thank god someone finally wrote something useful on smart clients. Within a few hours of reading this book, I had a clear understanding of what a smart client is and how to build my own."
5,THE Smart Clients book,"This is THE Smart Clients book! If you are going to be implementing smart clients, you must read this book. The first few chapters will make you an expert. I've been working with smart clients before they were called smart clients...and I have learned from this book!"
4,Worth a $40 Gift Card,"I have been reading this book along with the smart client guide I downloaded from Microsoft. This book is actually pretty good. The author doesn't try to confuse you with complicated examples that take away from the concepts. The book discusses some of the smart client implementations by Microsoft, which is good because it gives you several sources to understand exactly what smart clients are. I had no idea this stuff was available, which is why I bought the book. It was definitely worth the $40 gift card I spent. Just to be fair, some of the later chapters could have been better but I got my moneys worth."
4,Minsky is a bold thinker,"I work in virtual human technology and Minsky has long been an inspiration. I can't just sit down and read this stuff through, I have to think about it in chunks. Society of Mind suggests some operational views of the mind that can be helpful in designing thinking machines. I don't always agree with him and sometimes he's not the easiest guy to read, but overall this book is a must read for any one interested in how the mind may work and how to emulate it with Natural Language/artificial Intelligence engines."
5,This book may change the path of my life,"I bought this book, two months ago and I didn't finish it. I have given it 30 minutes every night before I sleep. When I sleep, I am completley excited, filled with ideas, with hope, that may be one day we will be able to fully understand how we think, may be one day all the drudgery and routin works in the whole world is being done by good,intelligent agents(robots) and people have enough time to do good for themselves and society. I don't remember any book that I understood completley and enjoyed at the same time. It's not only the subject the attracts me, but somewhere hidden inside the book you will see how this great mind(Minsky's) works. I am sure that my reasoning ability have increased a little after starting reading this book. I think one day Minsky's name will be called over and over when all his dreams(now mine also) come true."
2,The last reviewer got it wrong,"The book has nothing to do with artificial intelligence. It has everything to do with speculation. And since no one has builty the society of mind from this blueprint in over 15 years, what does that tell us about the usefulness of the idea??"
5,Reasonable instead of AI,"Marvin Minsky are great scientist, but he and the crowd are mistaken.Intelligence can't be artificial. Only system could.My definition for reasonable system is""System is reasonable if it could define it's own behavior by own representation of the World accessible to it.""Cognition is an illusion. No entity could be named ""Conscious"". That term could serve only as tag on the systems satisfying given above definition. My E-mail: szeldich@netzero.net"
4,are we of one mind? NO,"Marvin Minsky, pioneer in AI presents digestible pieces on how the mind works, how it develops. Excellent. Probably intended for the AI community, but works for anyone wanting a better understanding of the mechanics of their mind."
5,Great Insight into possible mechanisms for the mind,"This book is wonderfully readable! Each page is a chapter in itself describing possible mechanisms that cause and describe our being. If nothing else, this interesting read will make you think about thinking. Check it out!"
5,"a modern ""The Origin of Species""","like Darwin's epiphany- Minsky's genius has revealed an idea that once understood- it is almost unquestionable- and makes you shout ""Of course! how could I have not seen it!"""
5,GrandParent Best Gift Ever,This has been the best gift ever. It did not take my son-in-law any time to put together. My grandson who is 2 1/2 years old LOVES it.Thank you for a great product Little Tykes!Shipping cost is a bit high (...). That was a big draw back for me.
4,Wowzer..,"We bought this for our almost 2 yr old for Christmas and he loves it. We set it up in his playroom during the winter time so he could enjoy playing with it, but are planning to move it outdoors soon."
4,Dick S,"excellent service from dealer, the product exceeded my expectations, and I will order from them again"
2,Low quality,"This light has a nice design. But,it has cheap plastic nuts for the adjustments. It arrived with one of the black knobs broken and the plastic lever that locks the adjustable stand broke while I was assembling the light. I used it for an hour and thirty minutes and one of the bulbs blew. Don't expect much and be prepared to buy a lot of exspensive bulbs."
4,The Nation will put you under its spell,These youths came crashing out of the Fugazi dominated DC punk scene unexpected and overwhelming. Ian Svenonious delivery of a mysterious propogando laden youth gospel is at times screamed then whispered into the ear. The band takes its hardcore energy and channels it into a jazz structure leaving the whole mess busting at the seams with intensity that if not prepared can be off putting. All together one of the most compelling albums of the decade and the premiere of a new voice that can still be heard preaching over the hot rodded soul of the Make-up.
3,Typical 70's cd.,"Not horrible, but nothing like there first album. Almost completely different lineup. If you like a band such as sugarloaf you may like this one. Very similiar."
5,Tasty and healthier option for snacktime!,"My kids LOVE their 'Elmo crackers'...I do too! They taste like Ritz crackers, but are a much healthier choice. Their small size makes them perfect for toddler fingers. Thanks to Earth's Best for creating healthier alternatives for our hungry kids!"
1,NOT HEALTHY FOR CHILDREN!!!,"I bought these for my 2 yr old and 11 month old. WHile I love EB products, I bit into these and said OMG these are SALTY!!! Salty like you can taste the granules of salt on your tongue! Come on, you expect EB to be a healthy alternative-yeah right. Wont be buying these anymore and mad I spent my money on them. Like the other reviewer said 'save our children's kidneys and skip these'."
4,Tastes ok,"It's an ok product, but my daughter is not too excited. We usually love Earth's Best, so by their own standard, this is not as good as the others."
3,Like that it's Organic but can find same item with that quality with larger quantity.,"Like that it's Organic but can find same item with that quality with larger quantity. My son likes the taste. It's an option for a dry snack or travel snack. So there are pluses, but the price for the small amount doesn't make it a total win."
1,SALTY!,"The first time I tasted these crackers, I thought to myself ""Are you kidding Earth's Best?"" Really EB should know better. 220 mg of Sodium in a single serving of 20 g. Save your developing baby's kidneys and buy low sodium Ritz crackers which has 30 mg in 16 g (I know it's not organic). I would never each these crackers because they are too salty for my tastes."
2,i just never shop at store expires in a few month.,bought in June/11 and expires in October/11.they just look like old stock.i just never shop at store expires in a few month. i do not like them!!
5,Sons favorite snack plus Best price could find,These are my 18 mth old Son's 1 of 2 favorite snacks plus this is the Best price I could ever find for these. ;) elated because our stores stopped carrying this flavor for some reason Thanks
3,Live Set (LIVE) - Michael W. Smith,"I am a fan of Michael W. Smith and enjoy most of the music he has written. However, this album I found to be too loud and some of the words of the songs are hard to hear. I have severeral albums by him and his album ""Lead You Home"" is a truly remarkable CD of a gifted songwriter/singer."
5,Classic Michael W. Smith!,Michael W. Smith live in concert! No matter how many times I listen to this one it never gets old!
2,He misses his Mark all togther on this one,This was not Micheal Smith at his best I give 2 stars. George Bretz.
2,Too many left out,"Too many of the contemporary aircraft do not even appear in this book. For Cessna, only the 152 & 172 appear, but not the 206, 210 or models like the Cutlass. Beech Duke & Duchess not featured. Blackbird not in, etc. Many Pipers missing. Then they give pages of planes that nobody will ever see.Specs are also very limited.One would expect at least the common planes (as mentioned above) to be featured."
4,A good buy!,"I purchased a reconditioned licorice mixer & have used it now a few times. I got a good deal on it here from Amazon & love it! No problems with it at all, & it only had a very tiny scratch on it."
5,fantastic value,"I was sceptical on buying a factory reconditioned model, but after reading all the other reviews I dedided to go for it and I'm very pleased. The mixer arrived and I immediately started using it-it's great. One tiny little cosmetic flaw that was touched up with matching ""paint"" on the base behind the bowl that can't even be seen unless your actually looking for something wrong with it-it's great, and at less than half the price of a brand new never touched one, it's a wonderful value for someone on a budget. I recommend factory reconditioned to everyone now. A 6 month warranty rather than a 1 year warranty is no big deal to me-I love my new mixer-now I have ""power tools"" in the kitchen comparable to my hubby's power tools in the garage :)"
3,No pouring shield,"I picked this item as a gift to myself before the holidays. When I opened it I did not receive a pouring shield. The advertisement stated that a pouring shield comes in the box. It also stated that it came with a pouring shield in the description. I am dissapointed. I did notice however...that it does NOW state that a pouring shield is NOT included in the description BUT....""In The Box"" at the bottom of the page it still shows a pouring shield included. I have not called customer service yet. I just received it and will call today."
1,NO Pouring shield included but was advertised,"I called kitchenaid and they told me to purchase a pouring shield. I told them amazon advertised a pouring shield included in the purchase price. I'd appreciate if amazon would stop their false advertising of the contents of the box. Please send me the shield that I""m missing. Also, please redo your description of the item and it's accessories.All people who have purchased this item should be given a free shield since it was told to us that it was to be included."
4,Factory-Reconditioned KitchenAid Accolade,"I love my Accolade. The price was very reasonable & it looks basically new. The only reason I did not give it 5 stars is because it is a bit loud. Other than that, I have had no problems with it & have been baking cookies like crazy! ;-)"
4,Beth G.,I love this mixer. I wish the bowl was a little bigger at the top so that it would be easier to pour the ingredients in when it's turning. But it works great
5,BEST DEAL IN TOWN,"THIS IS THE BEST STAND MIXER I HAVE EVER OWNED. I BOUGHT IT LAST JANUARY AND HAVE MADE HEAVY BREAD DOUGH IN IT AT LEAST 3 TIMES EVERY WEEK SINCE PURCHASING AND IT HAS PERFORMED EXCELLENTLY. I WOULD HIGHLY RECOMMEND THE PURCHASE. DON'T BE APPREHENSIVE ABOUT BUYING A RECONDITIONED ACCOLADE, MINE LOOKS LIKE NEW AND PERFORMS LIKE NEW. HAPPY BAKING!!!!!!""A VERY HAPPY CUSTOMER"""
2,KitchenAid Accolade 400,"This item was sold in the discription stating it come with a pouring shield. I emailed them and got a respond as follows:Thanks for writing to us at Amazon.com.I have reserched the web site and found that this ""Factory-Reconditioned KitchenAid Accolade 400 Stand Mixer, Meringue""Does not include pouring shield. You can see the product description in the following URL.Then they give you a website to go to telling you in two placesit comes with a shield.The mixer when I recieved it did not work. Kitchenaid say they discontinued them and wanted to exchange it for a 325 watt vs the 400 watt I originally purchased. I sent it back to the company to get fixed. Not a good purchase on my part!!!"
4,"Generally great , but a few issues","We just purchased this and are generally very pleased with the stroller. It seems sturdy, is easy to fold and unfold, and has a nice sunshade, cupholder, and cushiony seat for our 6 month old. He seems very comfortable. Steering is easy, and I like that it is quite narrow.A few things came up that almost made us return it - the main issue being that the handles are not extensible, like they are on the deluxe model. Since we live in a very hilly neighborhood, longer handles would be easier on the back, especially for my husband (who is 5'10"")The second issue is the cross bar in the basket, which makes it difficult to carry large objects. But this is minor. The stroller is sturdy and balanced, so there have been no tipping problems with a full diaper bag hanging from the handlebars.In general, we're happy with the price/quality of this stroller, and I love that it can be recycled or repurposed by the company when we're done with it."
4,worth the extra $$,"This stroller is awesome. It is a very good looking stroller. It comes with a huge basket and is super light.I can push it with one hand (and it doesn't go in a circle like my chicco c5 which broke after 1 use) The handles are comfortbale I'm 5'3"" and my husband is 5'11''.My son who is 2 is comfortable in the seat without being all cramped up. There is plenty room to grow. It also holds up to 55lbs.It would've gotten 5 stars if it came with a rain cover and a handle for easy carry and putting it in the trunk and/or airport security belt. At the price it should've, but a small sacrafice for comfort for the little guy."
5,The best stroller!,"After reading reviews for Maclaren and Chicco strollers, I decided to purchase the Baby Planet Solo Sport. First of all, it was easy to assemble. I had to practice folding it a few times before I got the folding down. We brought it to Disneyland for 3 days this week and it was easy to fold and take on the parking lot tram. My 17 month old was able to fall asleep a few times with the seat reclined all the way down. I do find the stroller easy to maneuver. I found the crossbars in the middle of the basket awkward, but you can place items underneath it. Overall, I think it's a sturdy, lightweight stroller and in my opinion worth every penny."
3,"Beautiful, but not versatile","Love that this stroller is very baby friendly and that it is so damn beautiful. The back rest can be adjusted to many different positions and there is lots of cushioning so your baby rides in luxury. Not good if you have to travel by public transportation or have to climb stairs with it. The canopy actually broke because I live in a building with no elevator and I had to lift it up and down 2 flights of stairs every time I went out with it. There's also no shoulder straps so you can carry it. And with the combined weight of your baby and the stroller, it can definitely harm one's back if lifted."
4,Love the stroller!,"We bought this stroller when our baby outgrew the Pram. Since then it has been all over San Diego and Disneyland! The baby can easily take naps in the stroller when we are out because it reclines into a bed position. The foot rest also adjust to keep her little feet supported until they are long enough to dangle comfortably. The handles are easy to hold onto and there is plenty of room for me to strap on the diaper bag. It is a very sturdy stroller. We had trouble with the canopy, I think it became distorted when it got too hot in the sun, but Baby Planet had a new one to us within the week so we did not have to miss any outings."
4,Good purchase for the money,"I reviewed strollers, like other mothers, for a few weeks before I decided on this one. I wanted a cheap and well designed stroller for my toddler. We got to the zoo and in airports and malls a lot!!! I like this stroller for almost every reason. It has a really cute look and comfy padding for my son. It folds rather small and quite easily. It's light. My only issues were this: I wish it had a carring srap(it's kinda akward to hold in any such way), the visor could provide better sun coverage(the weather shield would be good to come with it or buy after), and the strap between the legs is just to far back. The part where it meets the fabric to keep it in place is too far back and makes it uncomfordable for an older child. I just took the strap out from the seat and made it a 4-point harness instead. Overall my son loves it. It has bright blue and meets all my needs. The cross bar in the basket doesn't interfear in any way!"
3,Tell Me A Tale,"And what a tale it is. Years removed from slavery, a teen-aged Moses leaves his caretakers and makes his way to Red Springs, North Carolina. When he reaches his destination, a ramshackled country store, he finds a group of men and while liquoring them up, begins to tell them a tale. As Moses' tale ends, one of the men realizes that this just isn't any old tale but his realization comes just a little too late.If you can get past the first couple of chapters, you'll find that this is a decent piece of storytelling. I found the story pretty far-fetched, but it's well-written and finely crafted with nifty twists and turns that I didn't see coming. I must admit, it took about two weeks for me to finish this because while I found the story quite interesting, it was hard to read. I didn't find a rhythm or flow to the writing, so I was only able to read a few pages a day. It's pretty solid, though - different from my norm but not something that I would read again."
2,WATCH THIS MOVIE WITH KIDS,"This movie was not funny although it tried desperately,(perhaps thats why they didnt advertise it as a comedy).I got about 20 minutes through it and stopped.Only watched further along into because my kids saw it on the shelf(even they got bored with it).Although i saw it only 2 months ago..it is a vague memory.Do not buy this film unless u can get it real really cheap.Finding a respectable ninja/shinobi movie is harder than finding a good lasagne or shoes for that matter.Oh well the search continues,Any ideas?"
4,Modern take on traditional Genre,"The story centers around a triangle of Ninjas who have grown up and trained with eachother all their lives. If you are not familiar with Nakano's work then this movie will come as a shock for it is not your classic samurai movie. Instead Nakano breaks away from rigid tradition and does something different for a modern century. Though i will always enjoy classic japanese cinema, its great to see a young director do something new. Red Shadow features great cinematography, entertaining characters, and an intimate storyline. This one should definitely have a place on your shelf."
4,Ninja A Go-Go!!!,"This is a great movie. It is intended as a light hearted adventure. A younger generation's not so heavy journey through friendship. Maybe some people don't care about such things, but I do :).It's hip ninja action with 2 male leads who try to do just that in that silly way that makes this a joy to watch. Personal issues arrise and we are witness to how 3 young friends interact with each other. In the end they come out showing what friendship is all about.How can you not like the Ninja Perfect Landing? ;)"
1,"Run, run hard from this mess","Unwatchable dreck. And coming from Toho studios? Toho has been around since the 1930's...and produced all the Akira Kurosawa films, which includes The Seven Samurai. Granted, Toho also produced a slew of all those huge monster flicks, starting off with Godzilla in 1954. Many silly, but never inept."
3,"Entertaining, but...","Two things I immediately noticed: 1) Ancient Japan didn't have toenail clippers, 2) Nor did they have aerosol spray bottles... both of which were shown in the film. This cheapens it for me. While the action scenes were good, the acrobat scenes were highly unbelievable, and the part where Akakage disappeared in thin air were a bit over the top. That and the part where the master was creating fireworks from his fingertip. It was all done in a serious manner. If this was supposed to be a spoof movie it missed its mark big time. Maybe only a Japanese sense of humor would get it. I don't know. I did moderately enjoy the movie, despite the obvious cheesiness."
5,A Great Holiday Video!,"This is a wonderful Holiday video, a terrific family video. Marie Osmond shines as Star.The story, characters,and animation are all excellent.Very enjoyable!"
5,Very Interesting,"This book definitely held my attention. It is well written and documented. Some have claimed that it seems an exageration for the author to have been involved in so many unholy arenas in his life, but it does not surprise me knowing how the enemy will lead one down one unholy path after the next until one is destroyed or until The True Savior is found."
3,It's not really leather.,"I really thought this was going to be leather. I guess I was being naive. It basically is made to look like it is leather, but it's plastic. But as a mousepad it works well. No problems with my mouse. The little logo on the corner is kind of annoying. But overall I guess it's nice to able to put in photos and change them whenever I get bored.I also bought one in burgundy leather."
3,Excellent - but what happens to the authors names???,"I'm currently listening to this series of short stories on CD and thus far they are excellent. The problem is, the titles of the stories are given very quickly and the narrators don't tell the names of the authors. There is no listing of the stories on the cover or on the CD or on the inside jacket. I would love to know the name of each author as the story starts. Would have have been so difficult?"
3,Fair,I felt I knew more than this guitar player. I am 58 and have been playing guitar since 10. I also majored in music in college. He did not show me anything I already knew.
4,shimmers of brilliance,"Glow is one of my favourite albumns i've heard. place your hands, yer old and summer is in bloom are all awesome and most other tracks are great. few do lack in instrumental section but overal preety satisfying"
4,A welcome improvment over Replenish,"Well, Replenish was pretty good, but this just got better, as Reef finally hit the big time with singes such as Place Your Hands & Come Back Brighter. This is a very cool album, full of songs for pretty much every mood, such as the aggressive Your Old, to the more mellow Indifference. I would have to say that Come Back Brighter is one of the most infectous records of that year, and, as for all of the unspoken album tracks, well, many of them could have been singles as well."
3,an under-par rock album,"its got really simple music and the lead singer just sounds fake to me. he sounds really passionate and stupid about it. another thing is that he sings kind of normal and then starts really singing wierd. and it doesnt sound natural. its like hes trying to sing that way but he wants us to think hes not. there are some good beats in there that sound good with the funky bluesy guitar riffs. these guys can try there hardest but i just dont think they have a grip on what it takes to take their music higher. plus there is a song on this album where its really slow and he sings in a really high voice. and its like a love song or something and he complains the whole time. and then at the end of the song the music gets loud and more uplifting and he starts singing ""its gonna be all right."" over and over, and it is really silly sounding. i think they are just not a good band."
1,I'd rather chew aluminum foil.....,"If I had not had to read this book for a class on Weddings, Marriage, and Family: A Feminist Perception, there is NO way I would have ever had bought this book. Ms. Ingraham wants half the world's population to not marry AT ALL. Yes, there are excellent issues she brings up regarding sweatshops, racism, corporate greed, etc., but to deny a little girl a dream of wanting to be a princess for a day is ridiculus! She uses weddings and marriage interchangeably which gives a wrong impression. This book was the last straw for my EVER wanting to take another feminist course in college."
2,"Great topic, poorly executed","This book made some very good points and was a necessary exploration of the ingrained ""normalcy"" of marriage. I do feel, however, that the book lacked substance and repeated the same thing in a different way. This topic definitely deserves much greater attention and perhaps with more attention, we will get better and more thoughtful writers.I also was driven insane by the shape of the book. Besides making it physically difficult to read, it turned a supposed academic study into a novelty book"
2,Ranting instead of argument,"I began this book expecting to agree with much of it but was very disappointed. The author is ranting instead of calmly stating a realistic argument. If I understood correctly, she believes that the Wedding Industrial Complex (with some vague notions of society and government) CAUSES women to desire marriage, view themselves as princesses and then spend as much money as possible on the wedding.Although her argument is far-reaching her facts are extremely narrow- (she spends a chunk of the book repeating herself with magazine advertising statistics).If her point was to let us know that many business owners within the wedding industry do not operate out of good will but are in fact out to make as much money as possible, point taken. But I knew that before I read the book."
2,Poor fit,"I bought this as an 'around the house' bra, so I wasn't concerned with looks or whether it could stand up to exercise. Unfortunately, the cup size is much too small and the band too loose. I can understand why this bra is so cheap."
2,doesn't hold,this bra doesn't hold anything. it will cover you they still bounce everywhere and needs consistent readjusting. Not very helpful in any capacity
3,Too thin,"It's comfy but the material is too thin, it doesn't have a pad to support your boob. I wouldn't wear it for workout."
1,awful,Ripped as my daughter tried it on. Skirt not the same length around. Very poorly made. Will never be seen outside her room.
4,Makes a little girl smile,"I just received this as a Halloween costume for my little girl, but it could easily be a dress for a play or something.It's not satin or the netting the American Ballet Theatre uses but it isn't like something you could get in the Dollar Store.The fiber optic effects are great and they are controllable, through a tiny button. If you have ever purchased any such items at the circus or fair, you are familiar with this.The jewels attached to the front aren't very durable but honestly who would purchase this seeking Crown Jewel attachments.All in all this is a nice costume for dress up, plays, Halloween, etc.It does run small which is why I am glad I got the 8-10 size (our daughter really wears 6 or 6x). I would say do as I did and buy a ""size up"".The smiles on my little girl's face and my husband's make this a worthwhile purchase.I also bought a fake tiara and wand and wings to complete the outfit but this can stand alone."
3,Ugh,"Paid $35 for this costume for a toddler that is supposed to fit a 4T but I don't think it will fit my very thin tall niece. We got a costume with only one ribbon. Very cheaply made, and it is itchy."
2,Cute but dissapointed,"Dress was very cute but the light colors do not match what is displayed on screen. One color lights not multi. The lights only worked a few times and then stopped working all together. Had used for 2 hours, long enough to trick-or-treat."
3,fun for child use for short time,Stitching came apart in places very quickly.. Battery for flashing lights died before trick or treating was over.. but overall since it made her feel very happy and beautiful it was priceless..
1,Don't waste your money,My daughter fell in love with this dress when she saw it online. We were very dissappointed in the quality of the costume. The lights in the skirt do not stay on and you have to keep turning it on all the time. I would not waste your money on this product.
1,poor quality,fabric on the outfit was cheap and very itchy. I did not want any child to wear it for fear of skin irritations the lights did not work either
1,Propaganda for the New World Order,"This show has to be one of the most blatant and perverse piece of lies and anti-population propaganda ever shown on TV. The lovely, scantily clad Odona thinks she can ""save her planet"" by infecting herself with a disease that no longer afflicts Kirk and passing it on to her population, which is medically impossible. The show is full of population hysteria that has since been disproven and ends with an incredibly warped scene of Kirk and McCoy grinning in approval as the depraved Odona returns to depopulate her planet."
5,Fishing Stories at their best!,"Just about everybody has either experienced the sport of fishing or they know someone who has. This book is the perfect choice for all who love fishing and for all who love those that fish. The stories are a good mix of humor, sentimentality and inspiration.Note to Erie, PA residence: Having gone through the ""GoFish"" art project the last couple years, this book is a perfect follow up to that event. There is a story in the book based on fishing in our local Edinboro Lake."
5,Great Buy,I received this book within 4 days and I live in the midwest. My father loves it. He is 81 and loves to fish. It arrived in excellent condition. THANKS Amazon
2,Great Stories,"The stories were very well written with the exception of Jennie Martin. I just don't beleive her stories, though she passes them off as the truth. I also heard that the fish she catches are hand offs from guides. She fly fishes irregularily and posts that she doesn't catch many fish either on her own website. I think she should not have been included with the other illustrious fishing writers."
5,A Book for Everyone,"Young or old, large or small, male or female, this is a book that will please, delight, and inspire anyone who has ever baited a hook in anticipation of catching that lunker whether in fresh or salt water.Some stories made me howl with laughter, and a few caused tears, but all are uplifting and made me want to read more."
1,Cumbersome,"Sir Gibbie was recommended by a friend but somehow I have not been able to embrace it with the same fervor. It is difficult to read in that it has quite a bit of dialog written in scottish dialect which slows the story down so much that you forget what you are reading because it took so long to figure out what the character was actually saying. I am sure it is a lovely story but I could not get into it and I am glad I didn't have to pay for this edition. There was one long conversation between two characters where I was real not sure what it was all about and only got the gist of it. NOT a page turner, this one, unless you are just trying to get past certain parts."
1,Not a great Fugazi record,"I bought this record when it was originally released back in 1991. Fugazi had been getting a lot of attention around that time due to the success of the Repeater record, which I believe came out the year before. I this thoroughly uninteresting record. The music conforms to the Fugazi template with droning guitar sounds, pseudo-dub drumming and basslines, and the annoying Ian/Guy lyrical dichotomy: Ian writes the straightforward preachy stuff while Guy gets all esoteric and weepy on us. Kids, take it from an old fart: this band is really just Phish for the hardcore set, managing note-for-note renditions of Ted Nugent classics (compare ""Stranglehold"" with any Fugazi tune - pathetic huh?) most fifteen year olds have never heard, let alone forgotten. So scrape some loose change together and go buy a 'Noog record off that needy dude who hangs out on 7th Avenue in Brooklyn around the corner from the D train. Please don't finance any more Fugazi condos in Georgetown."
4,"A downslide, but still good.","This isn't as strong 13 Songs or Repeater. They take some chances, instead of staying with the tried and true, but some fall a bit flat and the songs aren't as strong."
1,"Not Sharp, Not Matter What","Bought this from Amazon at the same time we bought the Sigma 10-20 super wide and the Canon 100MM Macro. Those two lenses are great, this one is a complete dog. Unfortunately, we have been so busy with the other two only recently have we had the need to use this one. The clarity is simply poor at all focal lengths and F stops. Does not matter if hand held, or on a tripod with a wireless flash, it's a dog. Just tried to return it, today is the 31st of May, and Amazon says my return window expired yesterday. Now I'm going to have to deal with Sigma I guess. I'll never buy another Sigma lens."
4,A MUST BUY!,"Be proud of Pelican and what they have achieved, because this expansion ram rocks and definitly the BEST! You will instantly see the better graphics, sound, anything you can think of. For the price I garuntee you will have spent your money wisley, get one for your N64 TODAY."
2,Failure,"This expansionpack is a failure. Oh sure, it gives a little better graphics but thats all. Just get the other one."
1,won't hold the weight of my novatron monolight,"You would thing a novatron light stand would hold a novatron monolight, but it doesn't. If you plan on changing the position of the light stand, BUY ANOTHER BRAND!"
3,Talk about Kim,"Kim Hill has made 2 good albums according to my opinion. I remember she had a hit here in Sweden with ""Snakes in the grass"" and that's when i discovered Kim. Otherwise i'm not into gospel music at all, but this album is more of a pop/singersongwriter album. That's why i like it more. ""Inside of you"" is one of the favourites and of course ""Snakes in the grass"" too."
5,Merry Christmast!,"If you enjoy the MUSIC and the HEART of BJ Thomas... it all comes through in this great recording! From all I have read and heard, I know that Christmas is BJ's favorite time of the year. The INSPIRATION, MEANING and REASON for the SEASON comes through in a most meaningful way!"
2,Questionable Quality for the Millenium,"This book of elderly, sometimes fuzzy photos and rough drawings is outrageously overpriced, even with the small Amazon discount.Try to find a copy of the far better Rukl Moon Atlas, or write lots of letters to Kalmback to get them to reprint Rukl.The only virtue of this book is the paucity of any Moon Atlas - a juicy opportunity for someone - Hello Msrs. Tirion, Dickinson, Ottewell, Crossen, Kepple or O'Meara?Help, help!"
3,Old pictures,"Old pictures and quite badly drawn maps of the moon makes this book feel to expensive no matter what it costs.Although, it gives you (as a matter of facts) very much information of the lunar surfice when it come to manmade names of the different places. Still some names misses, like the crater named after Neil Armstrong - where is it?I also wish a book that says it is an Atlas of the moon, sold year 2001, would contain fresh photos of better quality (The Hubble Sky Telescope could maybe do something for us moonfans!) and better drawings. And why not more information about how and where the names of the places came to real and, what I really miss - pictures of parts of the earth placed on the lunar surfice to give me a view of how big the craters and the moon as a whole actually is. And why not a part in the book with pictures from the Apollo missions?! More could be done."
3,Great Show,"This show is great, the writing is good, the actors are funny, and there has been some great character development this season. The guest stars are spectacular, especially Cary Elwes reprising his role from last season as an international art thief and Nestor Carbonell from ""Lost."" The show itself deserves 5 stars.One complaint: disc three will not play properly in my Samsung Bluray player, although all the other discs play fine. It plays in my laptop and my XBox 360, but not the Bluray. I have no idea why and I have seen that other people have had the same complaint with other DVD players. This is unfortunate."
2,Disappointed,"I was a big fan of the first four seasons with clever detective work and interplay between the characters. Season five lost all of this. The little detective work this season has tends to be bumbling with successes primarily coming from luck instead of a clever assembly of the miscellaneous facts.Even worse, the characters seem uncomfortable with their lines like you might expect during the first year of a series. I don't know how that happened after they have been together for five years. Nearly all the personalities have shifted enough so they look and sound like actors instead of characters.In the end I don't know if it was a director change or a writer change or both but I got too bored to watch all the episodes."
1,Wonderful series but poor quality control.,"This a a great series and I own the first four seasons. We ordered the fifth season popped it in and sadly enough the first disk was defective. The video became choppy and skipped around beginning with episode two. Tried it in a different player and the same results. No problem. I called costumer service and they sent a replacement. The replacement had the same problem on two different players as well. The conclusion I came to as well as customer service was that there must be a bad production run. They quickly issued a full refund. The series gets 5 stars, the quality control of the manufacturer gets one star."
5,Date Night,My husband and I love to watch a few episodes each night. We love the humor and the slight mystery. We mostly like to see how he used clues throughout the episode to figure out the crime. Another plus is that they don't show too much of the crime (I don't like to see such parts).
5,psych is the best show,We have all five seasons now of psych and watch them over and over. It is one of our favorite shows. Season five does not disappoint.
5,Psych Season 5 DVD,"Psych is the best show on TV and this DVD set is great! The commentaries are really funny, especially Romeo & Juliet & Juliet, as well as the gag reel. There is also a short behind the scenes video of a commentary. I would definitely recommend this DVD set."
4,a bit silly but...,"Yes, it's a bit silly, and this season is probably even sillier than the previous ones, but there are some good second degree gags. I like the fact that the 2 main characters keep on commenting everything in the midst of fights or dangerous moves: it brings a distance which most series lack totally. James Roday has grown a little too ""mature"" and chubby for the part... It is time to wrap it up, I'm afraid!"
5,Funny!!!!!,"If you liked the other seasons, you will definitely like this one. This one is for the collection along with seasons 1-4. This was a great buy especially for the price."
5,Exit Mundis,"This nonfiction work by Issac Asimov describes all the ways that the world could end, from the eventual collapse of the universe in the Big Crunch, to a boring ol' meteorite impact.But never fear, you planetary hypochondriacs, for the great doctor patiently describes how horribly unlikely most of the scenarios are, and how to avoid the few remaining.In true Asimov style, the information of the events are described play-by-play; from far back in history, when we first discovered the possibility of them occurring, to all that we have learned since then, information is derived from past information, so no one gets lost in technobabble. In fact, technobabble is even explained, so you too can learn how a black hole forms.Recommended for fans of the website Exit Mundis, which has a similar concept, and for all other fans of the good doctor's work."
5,Great album!!!,"This edition is like the perfect Rasmus album out there, get it!!! it's so great and full of talented melodies!!! I love it!!!"
5,One of my favorite CDs of all time!,"This cd is a MUST have! I've been a fan of the band for 3 years, and I think that this cd is the best one that they have. It's combination of hard rock and melodic vocals make this one that you can play over and over."
5,diserving,this record really held up to its potential. evey song has its own feel and additude. they diserved it when they went gold.
5,US version of this amazing album,"I'm super happy to finally own this version of ""Hide From The Sun"" by The Rasmus, it includes bonus tracks which are not included on the European versions, e.g. the song ""Trigger""!"
1,This book is not worth the $5!,"I am sorry for even hearing about this novel and i am very upset that it was required reading in my high school. It is horrible out-of-date novel about a guy named Heathcliff, and that's where i fell asleep. The description of things in this book take up 8 lines at a time and are unecessary! I don't reccomend this book to anyone!"
2,"maybe I'm crazy, but it was not for me","actually, i didn't find this to be the book that it is pumped up to be. I braced myself for an exciting deep love story, tragic..instead i was bored. The style was not for me, I found it difficult to read, and in the end was just plain dissappoited. Maybe my generation is too tained by TV, James Patterson and Danielle Steele for us to appreciate the finer works."
5,"""The Behavior of Belief""","Deep, illuminating, realistic, spiritual & amazing! A marvelous read for personal enhancement & a priceless jewel for preachers to work from. Each chapter's topic is its own individual message(a sermon in the rough).God's anointing was prevalent throughout...cover to cover!Zodhiates dissected the text and gave the reader an inside/up close shot of the actual meaning and explained the various key words with such clarity in our everyday language. I recommend this book for every christian reader, pastor, bible student and family everywhere. It will bless your life.Hat's off to Amazon for this fantastic find!"
4,The Weather Outside is ?,"I enjoy keeping track of the daily weather at our house. My first Weather Wizard's Diary was a gift ten years ago. I'm about ready to start my third one. For me, it has been enjoyable to jot down what I see going on. I know there are wonderful computerized ways to do this, but the Weather Wizard is perfect for me."
5,A Great Diary for Weather and Life Events!!,My husband has been using these diaries since the '80's to record highs and lows and important life events.
4,I love the weather so I'm hoping to love this diary,"I have always been fascinated with the weather so I thought this might be the perfect diary for my desktop. I'm not sure why I need to remember the weather from year-to-year, however, but since it only takes a moment to record the info in here, perhaps the purpose will become clear sometime around year two or three. Or not. No matter. It certainly wasn't expensive and when you spread the price over 5 years it seems like a downright bargain."
5,Weather Man,"If you want to be a weather person or work for the NOAA or the NWS this is the thing for you. It helps you to know every thing about weather I have one and I'm recording every day the weather in this book and I got it for Christmas 2001 and I LOVE it. So pick one yp today and enjoy,love and respect weather all arround you. :-)"
3,"Sorry, but I found this book to be too inclusive & unhelpful","This work is so inclusive that it is inconclusive. The authorattempts to summarize various perspectives about women's anger fromChristian, Judaic, and Buddhist perspectives. The problem is that shedoesn't do justice to any of these faiths because she just picks andchooses the pieces of each belief system that agree with her veryfeminist perspective. She is particularly fond of Carol Gilligan'swork, so if you like Gilligan's works, you may also like this book.If you consider your own beliefs to be ""new age,"" you willalso probably enjoy this book. However, if you are a practicingChristian, or Jew, or Buddhist, I suspect that you, like me, will notfind the work particularly insightful or helpful."
5,"Easy to use, superb sound quality","Ordered this and use it for voice projection, not performance, but it works absolutely perfectly. The sound quality is much better than the Samson we had, and the sound is actually much better than the hard-wired handheld that we have. Shure makes great quality products. I am very impressed by the depth of the sound that this produces and you can hear it clearly. It has a sync button that makes connecting it to the receiver ever so simple. By far the best quality mic we've purchased in the past several years, and it feels sturdy, and as if it will last many years."
2,Great Sound... But that's not everything in a wireless mic...,"I purchased this microphone from Guitar Center and spent almost $400 on it when i was out the door. The sound is great!!! But... the cable that hooks the receiver into a power source has a short in it. As if it couldn't handle a bend? So whenever the cable or recover is touched at all, the power shuts off and back on again. This is my second unit since the first one was stolen from a gig, and the older one did the exact same thing. The second main issue which has led me to purchase a whole other system altogether, is the fact that I can only go about 20 feet from the receiver before I get dropouts and lose signal. 20 feet! I have a mobile DJ business and it works great when I'm emceeing behind the DJ booth, but during toasts or speeches, I'm sweating bullets, hoping they don't go too far.All in all, excellent lows and sound, terrible range and power supply unit..."
5,Shute PGX24/SM58 Handheld Wireless System H6,Works great with no problems. Just follow easy instructions on selecting the correct channel and it connects without a hitch. No dropouts ever.
3,Made in China,Shure mic made in China not in USA. I've bought this same model that was made in USA 5+ years ago. :(
5,Perfect step after baby swing!,"I had accidentally picked up the wrong swing for our granddaughter at Target so got online, found the Little Tikes and had it by the weekend! She LOVES it and really ""chills out"" when swinging!"
4,A great swing that will last through all your children,"We bought this swing for my first daughter when she was about 7 months old. She loved it from the get go! Now is is two and still loves to swing in her special red swing. The high back is great for babies, especially our new little girl who is now 7 months. There is also plenty of growing room, so that you will get more than one year out of it. A great addition to any outdoor set!"
3,Easy to use,"I found that this swing is easier to get your child in and out of compared to other toddler swings. However, my 2 1/2 year old hasnt taken much of an interest in it yet, but that could just be his personality."
5,In love!,"We bought two of these swings, one for our 11mo. old and one for our 23mo. old. They absolutley love them! They are very easy to get the child in and out of, very durable, easy to adjust seating position, and all arould great. Everyday that we can the girls are wanting in their swings. I bought mine for $20 a piece so this price is a steal!"
3,Hard to get child out of,I bought this swing for my son when he was 11 months old. It is easy to get him in but getting him out is another story. His feet get caught every time and I have resorted to lifting him out of the back. I am definitely looking for a different swing.
1,Fraying Ropes,We have had this swing for only two years and have only used it a few times and the ropes are fraying. It leaves little slivers all over the child and the person pushing the swing. Currently I have the rope duct taped and that is working for now. I do not want to spend the money on another Little Tikes swing after dealing with their customer service. They will not do anything about their defective product. If possible I would buy anything Step 2. They have awesome customer service.
1,poor quality swing that swings crooked,"i bought this swing for my 18 month old. it is a piece of junk. the ropes are not put in right, and the thing swings crooked. there is no way to fix this yourself, i have to lug the thing back to the store. do not buy this swing - get any other model - preferably one that you can adjust yourself to ensure that it swings straight forward and back - not diagonal like this particular swing. very annoying!"
3,My son's too big,"He received this as a gift for his 1st birthday. He is a big boy, at the time, he was 30 lbs and 36 inches and was almost too big for it when he received it. Six months later, we can get him in ok, but he gets stuck getting him out. He loves to swing, but it takes 2 people to maneuver this thing (one to hold him and the other to disengage his legs and pull the swing). Our only other option would be to sit his bottom in it and leave his legs dangling over the top. I'm not very comfortable with him swinging that way because I worry he could fall out. I'm currently shopping for a larger swing with a back that will last until he can balance himself on a big kids swing."
5,This swing is a real hit,This swing is such a big hit with all our grandchildren under 5. It can be swung back & forth and also goes in a circle which is lots of fun. And the design is so safe--no moving parts to come loose--they can swing high and no worries about a bar coming loose. We love it and it works for the baby and the 3-4 year olds too.
5,Must-Have Toddler Swing,"My daughter is 9 mos now. I bought this swing to attach to our swingset a month ago & she loves it! I cannot take her near any location where the swing is in site or she'll fall apart.The price, durability, & comfort of this wing was worth every penny."
5,Hours of affordable fun!,"My son LOVES this swing. He would swing for hours if I had the energy to push him!It was so easy to install on our existing swingset, and was very affordable. I also like how secure he is in the seat- no chance whatsoever of falling out or flipping over. It is very sturdy and durable. I would definitely buy it again."
3,Great swing but needs improvement,This swing is great as other reviewers have pointed out but here are some items to consider:1. It does not come with a swing set. So you have to buy one. They are quite cheap (around $3) although this is a trip to home depot.2. The restraint is not sturdy enough. It is very possible that the baby can pull it apart!3. The holes where the legs go in are too big. My baby was able to get his leg out of one and put it in the other! It might help if there was a way to restraint the leg hole so he cannot do that.So safety is questionable and I would not leave the baby alone for more than a minute or two in the swing.
1,This Swing Stinks,Buy the FP swing. This swing was very uncomfortable for my child and hard to get in and out of.
5,A great sturdy swing at a reasonable price!!!,"A great swing. Both my 3 year old and 9 month old just love it! I think its easy to get them both in and out of it. Ours has been hanging in direct sunlight for about 14 months and hasn't faded at all. My older son always preferred this ""bucket"" type swing (like they have at playgrounds) to the fisher price model. This has been a worthwhile purchase for our family."
5,Fantastic swing!,"Fantastic swing! Very sturdy, great size, a lot of support for little backs, and big leg holes. A great value."
5,"Many, many hours with this one!","It has lasted through all of my kids and every single one of them LOVED it as youngins. In fact, some of our best pictures of them are in this swing laughing hysterically.Fantastic value. :)"
1,bogus swing,"ropes are cheap,and while strong,make the swing sit at an angle and swing not straight, but in an eliptical figure eight pattern."
5,Sturdy Swing,Purchased for my grandchildren; very sturdy and was a great price. Child sits down inside the swing and with the safety belt I feel confident in this product.
2,Not the best swing,"I have to agree with a previous reviewer who mentioned the twisty ropes and short length of the ropes. First of all, the height of the swing is just perfect for me to get hit in the face with my toddlers feet. I haven't actually gotten hit because now I push from the back. The swing is crooked and swings diagonally, which doesn't bother my daughter, but makes it a little more difficult to push. I am not a fan of this swing. We got it because our other swings strap lock broke, but I actually prefer to use our old swing even though it's broken. My advise would be to keep shopping around for a better swing."
3,Hard to get out of.,"The swing is safe and fine in every way, except that I constantly struggled to take my child out of it, his feet inevitably getting caught. It was a two-person job to get him out. We ditched this and got a swing with a front opening bar instead."
4,Best Swing for kids with siblings!,"For anyone debating between this one and one of the infant-to-toddler swings: if you are planning on more than one kid or already have more than one kid I'd recommend this one. I had an infant-to-toddler before this swing but had to get rid of it when my daughter was 1 because my 3 year-old and 6 year-old sons and their friends kept trying to use it instead of their own bigger swings. They'd get caught in the straps and need help getting out. This swing is perfect because it holds no attraction to older kids and is clearly ""for the baby""."
5,Great Swing!!,"Another great product from Litte Tykes!! I would recommend this swing to anyone. Durable, and safe!"
2,I DIDN'T LIKE IT,THIS ITEM NEEDS MORE RESEARCH GOOD CONCEPT BUT IT IS NOT AS SAFE AS I WOULD I LIKE . IT NEEDS SOMETHING.
4,"Baby's first swing, loves it!","Got this for my son for Christmas. It is nice and feels sturdy. He loves swinging in it! We hung it on our existing cedar swing set next to our older sons' swings. The attached rope isn't long enough for the swing to hang at an appropriate length, but we fixed it for us. I guess it depends on where you plan to hang it, if the rope will be long enough for you."
1,no way to rate,We can't rate this product as we have not received it. Our attempts to e-mail Moonglo books have been unsuccessful. We are extremely unhappy over what is beginning to look a lot like fraud.
4,1960s -1970's Yiddish Humor,"If you grew up in a Jewish household, or in a Jewish neighborhood during the 1950s - 1970's You will appreciate the humor. It's a classic return to the Good Old Days.Enjoy it,Lenny"
3,"decent book, needed a read editor.","This is a decent book for using UML for VB, but I don't think the editor had his lights on while ""editing"" the book."
2,Digression Redefined,"This book is 50 pages of information compressed into 500. The author comes across like a fairly sympathetic, but totally disorganized lecturer. His editor had to be his worst enemy.The author's design guidelines and code examples may be useful to someone getting started with Visual Basic. The problem is, finding his ideas amid all the clutter and tangle.I wish someone would edit this work and publish it as an on-line magazine article."
2,Dangerous,"This book was a complete disappointment. The editors did the author no favors. The numerous errors (both typographic and technical) greatly obscured the valid content the author attempted to provide. The sample code is simply dreadful.If you buy this book, do not read it. Read ""Instant UML"" and ""Visual Basic 6 Business Objects"" (both from Wrox Press) instead."
2,"Good ideas, bad presentation","Jake obvious knows UML and VB, but as other reviewers pointed out, the presentation of his code examples is a mess. While the code contains good form and helpful ideas, because there are several other similar Wrox books out there, you can better spend your $39.99 elsewhere. I'll take a look at Jake's new book on project management, but only after I make sure he's using a new editor."
5,More than i expected,"I read the chapter titles for this before I bought it but upon reading I was even more impressed by its thoroughness and unbiased opinions. It is very scientific, up to date, and factual and leaves nothing out."
4,Informative and well designed to find your topic of interest,"Overall this is a very good book with a wide variety of information written in a consumer-friendly format. It is an overview so don't expect scientifically hard data from clinical studies. The only warning I have is to beware of any claims about indications for treating specific diseases. There are a lot of sentences that say marijuana ""may"" do this or ""is being researched for"" that or ""has been reported to help"" the other thing. So take any claims of efficacy with a grain of salt.There are discussions on how it is used as medicine, with some solid basic information on THC extraction methods into foodstuffs (butter, oil, etc). Anyone who is contemplating the use of marijuana as medicine for pain, nausea, etc. would appreciate this book."
3,Alright,"Not exactly what I thought it was, a lot of repeated information I already had knowledge of, however is a great book for newcomers to this topic."
5,Changed My Life,"I highly recommend this book. It really taught me how to think, view life and cope with a positive angle on life. Also, most importantly, it made me understand why my negativity had helped me cope with life in the past and why I felt unprotected when I viewed things positively. My life has changed for the better due to reading this book."
4,The five C's,"A little out of date in this digital age, but still very useful to know the basic of cinematography."
4,Good for the REAL basics,"This is no doubt a very BASIC book on Cinematography from 1965 (but still applicable today)- yet if you are unfamiliar with the basic Five C's of shooting, then it is a good tool for learning these rules. I recommend it for film students new to camera work. But if you have been working with shooting for awhile, it may be a little too basic."
5,5C's of Cinematography,"Have an original printing of this book, and so glad to see that it is still available. It is a superb book on the subject. I may be teaching a course, and if I can get quantity, may want to use it as the course text book.Antony Alan Botto, Producer{202} 255-4043"
3,Has some useful information but overall not very good.,"This book had a bit of useful information here and there, but it is extremely unorganized and unhelpful in the way it gives you its information. The book is also a bit outdated, however basic cinematography never gets completely outdated. Not awful but not great."
5,The Bible of Cinematography,"The five C's: camera angles, continuity, cutting, close-ups, and composition. This book takes the filmmaker through understanding exactly what goes into getting the best image imaginable onto film. The true treasure of this book is that is was written long ago enough that the author does not feel bound to polical writing: in this authors world there are black and white rules of what is acceptable and unacceptable. While ""creative-types"" may find his insistance on what can be done insulting to their vision, I think we can all agree that if you are going to break the rules, it is important to know them. If you read this book and study it, then you will KNOW the rules and UNDERSTAND when, why, and where you need to break them. It is a delightful read, filled with information, and though written in the 1960's... the concepts are timeless and very applicable to filmmakers in the 2000's. Buy it and enjoy it! Best Wishes....Jason"
4,A classic about 180-degree rule.,"This is a classic book (1965) about camera rules in cinematography. You can learn in this book all about axis and 180-degree rule. A lot of photos makes easy to understand all. But this is not a book about direction techniques. If you are interested in camera techniques, you must read this book, but also you must read other books about direction, montage, script etc... This is indispensable but not enough.These books are very interesting about direction: ""Film Directing Fundamentals"" by Nicholas Proferes, ""Cinematic Storytelling"" by Jennifer Van Sijll and ""Hichcock"" by Francois Truffaut (an absolute classic). About Script I recommend: ""The Writer's Journey"" by Christopher Vogler, ""The Art Of Dramatic Writing"" by Lajos Egri, ""The Anatomy Of Story"" by John Truby and ""Writing your screenplay"" by Cynthia Whitcomb."
5,The best book available for learning Classic Film Storytelling skills,"When I was just starting out as an animation storyboard artist, this book was recommended as ""THE BOOK"" for learning the language of film storytelling. It is clear and well-organized--with no fluff or nonsense. The principles are timeless, and since it was written at the tail end of the Hollywood studio system, it does not fall into any of the bad filmmaking traps that started to pop up in the late sixties. The photo illustrations are perfectly-suited to communicate the important points of clear storytelling.In 1994 this book was long out of print, and I paid about $150 for a used copy...so be very happy that this is once again available, and at a reasonable price!"
3,The basics and a must for a beginner...,"This is book gives cinematography some simple rules that helps future filmmakers and the book explains the rules fairly well. In addition, the images and pictures in the book enhances the readers ability to understand what the writer is trying to communicate. It is a good beginning for those who are interested in film making."
2,"Old, quite old",This book sounded interesting but i relized after purchasing it that it was published in the 60's. this book would not be for anybody who wants to learn new standards in flimmaking but rather learn the basics and how it was done back then.
1,THIS BOOK IS 30 YEARS OLD AND HAS NOT BEEN REVISED AT ALL!!,YES THIS BOOK IS OVER 30 YEARS OLD..COPYRIGHT 1965...UPON OPENING THE FIRST PAGE OF THE BOOK I SEE MY GRANDFATHER IN A SUIT...NOT TO MENTION THE ANCIENT EDITING EQUIPEMENT THEY MENTION.THE TECHNIQUES IN THE BOOK ARE VERY BASIC AND SOME ARE MORE DEVELOPED UPON...WHICH THIS NON-REVISED BOOK FAILS EVEN TO MENTION..SO IF YOU ARE LOOKING FOR HISTORY OF CINEMATOGRAPHY THIS BOOK IS THE ONE FOR YOU..IF YOU ARE LOOKING FOR TECHNIQUES FOR THE NEW MILLENIUM DONT PURCHASE THIS BOOK!!
2,"With all the respect, but...","I am for about one year in the process of gathering /Huntingevery knowledge i can, about filmmaking (actually video)Sorry but this is the most non-readable book i've baught.Whith all the respect to the author, who must have beena very important person in Hollywood 40 years ago, and to Mr. A.Miller who wrote the introduction, butdespite all my five effords i made in order to try to read some of it,i didn't manage to. Seeing all those b/w picts from unknownactors some 40 or 50 years ago mixed with endless texts, and then more irrelevant b/w picts from usa in the early 60's .. sorrynot for me. I'll try another book."
4,"Humorous, but not lighthearted poetry","Robert Funt has written a few poignant poems in this volume, but most reflect a rye sense of humor and an almost slap-dash style that makes the reading easy, and the self-deprecating humor both accessible and touching. I wanted more."
3,Made for a giant!,"The bag is sturdy but won't fit in the lockers at the pool. I find the handles difficult to maneuver. The bag seems off-center. It is very large for a swim bag. If you are looking to haul your entire wardrobe, this is the bag for you!"
5,Trust Charlap to pick a winner,Bill Charlap's collaborations with tenor sax players are some of the best examples of the continuing heritage of straight-ahead jazz. He has recorded with Scott Hamilton and Frank Wess with great success. And now he has given us a great session with traditionalist Houston Person. Newcomers to the world of jazz should listen to this release to learn why older fans flock to Charlap's performances and to experience the sounds that made jazz America's pop music 50 years ago.
3,"Okay, but there's much better out there","""Stay Down"" has some decent tunes on it, a couple of excellent ones (tracks 9 and 12, I forget the titles), but it has a few very dull ones and only lasts 45 minutes. It's definitely not at all commercial, but there are a lot of other bands that do this sort of thing a lot better such as Boards of Canada and Plaid, and I'd definitely invest in albums by those artists before this one, but this is still an interesting enough experiment, just lacking some of the depth of other artists in the genre on repeated listens. There's enough to suggest that their next album might pull a few surprises."
3,unprofessional behaviour,"There are several levels from which to enjoy this CD by the TWO LONE SWORDSMAN. For those lacking the propensity of active listening, STAY DOWN fits well as ""wallpaper"". It is unobtrusive enough to fall into the background yet, distinctive when acknowledged. As such, I find it easy to read with this music in the background. There are rewards, though, for those who listen more closely. Tracks 1-11 intimate a watery journey. This is accomplished through the use of ""bubble"" fx, tremelo with phase shifting, and familiar sounds presented in an unfamiliar way (e.g. backwards). An entertaining rhythm ties the journey together. If you are interested in electronic music with a theme that fits nicely with the decór, this CD will interest you."
4,Quirky and creative,"I heard a track from this album on Internet radio and knew I had to check out the whole CD but I didn't know the exact name of the band. Unfortunately the track I heard was called ""Gay Spunk"" so you can imagine the trials and tribulations I experienced searching for this CD on the internet. :PIt was worth it. Like a previous reviewer pointed out there is quite an underwater feel to the album and it roams around from hi tempo to low without ever getting too heavy or dance-like. I look forward to digging up some of their other CDs."
3,No depth!,"Despite the divers on the cover, this work lacks depth. This is nothing more than a ""concept"" album with one or two catchy tunes. The CD is suprisingly short (<60 min) for a mix album and ends right when it starts to grow on you. Other than the couple of songs that I really liked (tracks 9 and 11), the rest just sort of floats along with no direction. It would be nice background for a dinner party if it were longer. I would get their other works before this one."
2,"fiddlin john carson, vol. 7","my father marion ""peanut"" brown wrote ""do you ever think of me""?and "" the stockade blues"". he recorded this album with john carson in 1933.he also sang these songs on this album.and sang and played guitar on the rest of the songs on this album. he is in the atlanta country music hall of fame.he passed away sept. 5 2003.fiddlin john carson's grandson { johney carson}spoke at his funeral. i am very proud of my father and love him very much. thank you, marlene brown faith p.s. he was 96 years old"
3,Good b-sides,"Since the description does not give much information, I would check with Amazon before buying it . . . but, the version of the CD-single that I have is pretty good in terms of b-sides:""North and South of the River"". This would rank high among the canon of U2 b-sides lyrically.""Your Blue Room"". Although an atmosphere piece when compared to U2's other work, this is one of the better and more coherent tracks from 'Passengers: Original Soundtracks I' and features a rare vocal by Adam Clayton at the end."
5,LOVE IT,"love this work out and as i stated in my other review, i have no BARRE stuios in baltimore.. no bar method, daily method, pure barre, NOTHING.. i'm reliant on DVDs and this one is great so far! love it."
1,Worst intro to string theory ever written,This book is little more than an incoherent compilation of research papers. It is worse than useless.
5,CANT GET ENOUGH OF PAUL WILLIAMS,UPON LISTENING TO THIS CD I WAS VERY IMPRESSED WITH THE WORDS TO HIS SONGS.THEY ARE SO BEAUTIFUL THAT IT TOUCHES NOT ONLY MY HEART BUT MY SOUL.PERHAPS DUE TO THE FACT THAT I CAN RELATE MY OWN LIFE TO HIS MUSIC. HE IS ONE OF THE BEST SONG WRITERS I KNOW OF.I AM SURE HE WOULD BE GREAT IN CONCERT.
1,can't cancel order,"I'd like to cancel this order, as I ordered the incorrect item, but the amazon interface keeps erroring out and refuses to let me cancel. Sounds fishy."
3,1 of the better outlines...,"i've read many bible prophecy outlines. this one's good. daniel, israel, everything's covered. this guide has the BEST illustrations/charts."
5,Excellent resource,"Kabbalah by Gershom Scholem is not for the beginner. He traces the history and roots of Kabbalism and the Zohar. He was a professor of Jewish mysticism and writes as an academic. A beginner will be lost in the technical explanations. If you are familiar with Kabbalism, and want to understand the roots, history and how it has influenced everything from Freemasonry to Mormonism to mainstream Christianity, it is an excellent book. Gershom Scholem was the acknowledged authority on Kabbalism."
4,"The Kabbalah's history, facts and evolution.","If you are interested in Kabbalah's history and facts, definitions and biographies of the main figures that contributed to the evolution and development of Kabbalah - this book is for you.Although, if you are a member of one of the popular kabbalah organisation, you might be disappointed, since you would not find in it ""slogans"" of hope and motivation."
1,And I thought the Bible was over-the-top,This book just proves that religion is something the world does not need. You can get the same effect of this book by reading a Dungeons and Dragons rule guide or listening to a Helloween song.Avoid.
5,truly the blues who's who indeed,"As a member of the audience at many of the 'gigs' compiled here, I know first-hand of their accuracy,(a rarity in the field). Considering the age of this edition, there is still nothing that comes close to its accuracy and completeness. The info isn't spoon-fed, but the ""small print' leads to much cool fact-finding. For instance; BB King,(1964, Chicago's Regal Theater, the best known and most honored live blues recording ever), was the -opening act- for Jackie Wilson's show!"
4,i like it,"a must have for blues lovers. short biographies of all blues singers, from an early age with references and most important work."
5,Old school Christian music that never goes out of style!,"If there are any albums of Christian music that should get remastered, this needs to be one of them. Ever since my college days I have enjoyed this CD. The songs I like most are ""Secret Ambition,"" ""On the Other Side,"" and ""Help You Find Your Way.""There is one instrumental song titled ""Ashton"" which is based on the Frank Peretti novel ""This Present Darkness"" which has a lot to do with spiritual warfare. Smitty brilliantly sets the mood for this song... it starts out slow, the gradual crescendoes help build the tension and then picks up the tempo.Fans of Contemporary Christian music should definitely check this out. Michael W. Smith, sometimes referred to as ""Smitty,"" has written some unforgettable songs over the years. One of his most well-known songs, ""Friends,"" is timeless. It was a personal honor for me to sing that as a solo in church near the end of my teen years."
5,The first of Smitty's truly great albums,"For an album that came out in the 1980's, there's an amazing amount of great stuff on i 2 eye. Michael W. Smith really comes into his own here, delivering such powerful anthems like ""The Throne"" and one of my all-time favorites, ""Secret Ambition"". Any fans of Smitty's classic song ""Friends"" will eat up the song ""Pray For Me"". Also, don't overlook a wondrous instrumental, ""Ashton"". MWS was way ahead of the Christian music curve in the '80's, and this album is Exhibit A of that."
4,New Brazilian Sounds,"Think you know Brazilian sound? Take a listen to Anastacia Azevedo and think again: here's a vocalist who limits herself to no influence: at once blending hip-hop elements into a Brazilian Portuguese sound, then adding near-salsa rhythm to the mix."
1,Brave Heart - Kim Hill,"I had no trouble receiving this item in good condition. I have several of Kim Hill's CDs and this one is my least favorite. It is too ""rock n roll""for my taste.Jackie"
5,A real musicians album...,"This is quite possib ly one of the best albums I have ever heard...from the legendary Tommy Sims melodic bass playing, the tight drumming and Kims awesome voice...I cant fault this album. Every song is strong, its beautifully produced and arranged. Whether you like Gospel or not, you wont find something that you cant appreciate and enjoy on this album."
5,Coughlin,"I didn't read this book yet but I knew Jack back in the day when I referred to him as a Sh** Bird. He actually was a good Marine as were most of us. If this book is anything like the Coughlin I knew back in the 80s, then I am sure it will be quite a read. Semper Fi."
1,Don't waste your time,"I spent a number of years in the Marine Corps and can smell BS a mile away.""Shooter"" stinks. Semper Fi"
4,Deep insight into a complicated man/vocation,"The writing isn't the best, but I didn't buy this book for the writing, rather for the subject matter. Jack Coughlin is a complex individual with a heart for people. Still he killed people for a living. That dichotomy comes through with heartfelt emotion, wit and thoughtfulness. I appreciate that. A good story, an interesting guy in a complicated time--great elements to keep you turning pages."
1,If you were in the Marine Corps its Laughable,"I have been in the Marine Corps for 9 years, 6 as a scout/sniper. This book made me sick. Scout/Sniper's o not act like this, there is no top-ranked marine sniper we have no awards. We no longer collect confirmed kills. To see someone make money off of lies like this is heart-breaking. The public will read this a think it is true and pass this fish story along. If it was sold as fiction its just another story but to claim these events happened this way is unjust to the real scout/snipers in combat. Read NO True Glory if you want fact. You can read about what real marines do."
2,There must be better books of this sort out there,"This book was certainly a fast paced narrative. Basically, it's a walk through the author's experience in the second Gulf War as a Marine Sniper. I don't particularly think it paints him in glory, and actually found some of his insubordination and whining when things weren't going his way borderline appauling. In places it's as if he's tried to humanize himself by talking about his reaction to certain events and his home life, though the latter gets at best a thin treatment. The writing itself is somewhat forced at times and the language occassionally getting stilted. In general, it was an OK read at best, and even then only if you've got an interest in snipers. I'm not an avid reader of the genre, but I have to figure there are better books of this sort out there."
1,I wanted more,"I got this book hoping for an eye into the mind and heart and process of the ""shooter"", and I sort of got that. But I have to say, his writing style is SO bad that I just could not finish the book. Though some of his stories were interesting, he really is not a writer, nor a story teller. Maybe someone else will be better at getting the story across, this guy was not the one. I applaud his efforts though, and I wonder why the publisher ever released it."
1,SIMPLY THE BEST,best book ever the perphaps only book i read because i want toooBEST BOOKwho ever says it not GOOD IS WRONG
1,does anyone believe this,"I can't believe the author can believe it himself - while I'm sure at least a full 1% of this book happened the way described, I wish I had paid only 1% of the purchase price - I still would have overpaid"
5,"""Pumped Up""","Its going on the 4th day and my damn book hasn't arrived to the door step yet. I'm eagerly awaiting this read and to the critics that favor the content of the read over the passion of the story, all I can say is that Jack Coughlin is not a writer he's a Marine Sniper and his story should be honored above any writing mechanics.OOHRA!!!"
1,disrespectful,"I am an ex-serviceman who has been on ops, but I found this book and some of the 5 star groupies shameful. Is this a man who is a killer or a soldier. A soldier serves his country and friends, a killer serves himself and kills for self-gratification. This man is the latter. If you want to kill in a war zone,it is easy, it doesn't take skill. It does however take skill to fulfill your mission, your duties to your men whilst ensuring that no life is taken needlessly. This man only takes life, and I wonder how much was necessary. Did he really feel remorse for shooting civvies or does he feel that is just the right thing to say. Sounds plain trigger happy with no sense of discipline. Lets not get patriotism mixed up with collusion with self satisfied killing."
5,"Excellent book, written by a real marine sniper!","I tore through this book in two days. The only bad thing I can say about it is that I wished that it were longer because I was hungry for more after I finished it.Coughlin is the real deal. He has been in two theatres of operation: Desert Storm and Iraqi Freedom. He is highly decorated and has numerous confirmed kills. If you want to find out what it was like for him, buy his book. You won't be sorry."
3,okay read,"I bought this kindle book after it was recommended do to other purchases. Shooter was an okay read at times I found myself having trouble staying focused and picturing what was happening. There are also several typos and words in the wrong places, at least in the kindle version. Overall it wasn't bad. I still respect all the men and women who serve in the military."
3,Shoot the wife,"Yeah. Perhaps a bit of water under the bridge by this time but not a bad book. Interesting. As reviewer 'Mike' says there are no good shooters who can write. So the book makes a couple of good points - some good officers out there - maybe officer training works? Officer Bob's lurk in all the dark places of our lives - and get unjustly rewarded! What sticks out in this book is someone lurking far in the background - the wife. What an unholy b--ch. How any woman can dump a guy who is out there risking his life for her and her country? The 3rd party in this triangle is not much better. Sure many (most?) marriages fail, but sort them out before going on active duty or give it another try afterwards. They were in love once. Remember? Is the mother going to raise the children as another generation of spineless wimps? I sure hope Jack got custody."
3,Shooter,"The author relates his successful struggle with the USMC top brass to utilize the skill sets of Scout/Snipers in front line battle situations, rather than relegating them to taking out occasional designated targets. The editing is very poor leaving the reader the task of grinding through some very sophomoric prose, none-the-less, the story is worth the grind."
1,carlos hathcock greatest USMC Sniper of ALL time!,"i spent twenty years in marines from 1959-1979 & i was a TM instructor (target management)& can say without ANY doubt that carlos hathcock was & still is our foremost scout sniper we have ever had in marines! i watched this young man shoot 247 on qual day, watched him shoot 53 straight blacks at 500 yards? i cannot understand how mr.coughlin can even imply he was a better marksman? carlos used a 30-06 boatail ammo & reguarly made shots of 1500 yards or more in vietnam? while i know mr.coughlin was a good marine i find it VERY difficult imagining him better than carlos at any of the characteristics of a scout sniper than carlos!gun.sargent j.bryant"
1,"If you feel you have to buy, buy used ... awful book.","Respect the soldiers that do this. Respect all soldiers period - so no negative intentions there. But this guy is either the most egocentric person on the planet, or the worst writer in the galaxy. Can't decide which, but I should've asked my brother-in-law to buy it so I could've borrowed it instead of wasting my money."
3,Good Military Read,I liked this book for the realistic view into Iraq that I came away with. The author was also kind enough not to include to much language and gore. You do get a great sense of the Marine mind-set and camaraderie
2,SHOOTER,"Having read both books about Gunnery Sgt. Hathcock I was impressed not only with his technical abilities but also his modesty,humility,leadership and devotion to the Corps.I can sum up Coughlin's technical abilities as possibly being equal to Hathcock's but there the comparison ends. To me, what clearly came across in this book,is Coughlin's attitude of being a ""legend in his own mind"". He seems more concerned with looking bad in front of his fellow Marines while at the same time, beating the drum for the mystique(his in particular)of the scout/sniper.He takes many cheap shots at ""Officer Bob"" and takes exception to his being awarded a commendation medal and a bump up promotion.Obviously, higher ranking officers must have thought differently than Coughlin regarding ""Bob's"" abilities including Coughlin's own CO(McCoy)who could haved disapproved both awards."
1,DONT THROW YOUR MONEY AWAY,"This book is full of contradictions and tales. It well known among Marine Sniper Instructors that the author isnt listed on any of the graduation roles at Camp Pendleton,Camp Lejeune or Quantico. .The self proclaimed title of top rated sniper is joke and insult to the sniper comunity and the Marine Snipers that have done far more and been awarded for there acts to include the Silver Star. Dont waste your time or money on this book."
3,Author seems to enjoy shooting people a bit too much,"The author/sniper seems to enjoy shooting Iraqis a little too much. Of course, shooting enemies is one of his duties, and he has a right to feel good about doing it well. But the book overflows with cocky statements like ""I considered the ill-trained, poorly led soldiers of Iraq to be hamburger in my scope, practically begging me to kill them, and I was more than ready to grant that wish."" Still, if you can tolerate the author's apparent machisimo and arrogance, and his constant whining every time his superiors order him to do any job that does not involve shooting, you will get a little piece of action-packed history from the perspective of a person who lived it."
3,3 rating,"If you start from a 0 rating, then I had to give this book 3 stars right away because this author is someone who has done what very few people have done. His description of the moments before killing an Iraqui soldier is mesmerizing. The rest of the book fails however. its written with a third grade style of writing. The author's sense of defiance towards Colonel Bob, his platoon leader does not convey any true rebellion in the writing style. His description of the comradarie between his fellow soldiers is not heartfelt. If the whole book was about scouting, sighting and scoping enemy targets, then this book would have generatyed a 4 or 5 rating."
1,Lies,"First of Jack Coughlin was never a sniper. While he may have been a fine marine that's up for debate if he has to lie about what he did to sell books.The book is full on inconsistency's and tactical errors that would most likely get you killed. Other reviewers have given plenty of fine books to read instead of this. Save your money, and if you already own this book you might as well use it to steady that wiggly leg of your coffee table it would be much better suited for that."
4,Good story. No nonsense.,"I personally liked this book despite its sometimes choppy writing style. The writing is its down point, and not because he is a terrible writer, but because he is not a great writer. Its a great story if you can get through some of his ego. I think that the story is good enough to outweigh the sometimes not flashy writing style."
1,Not worth it,There are far better books out there that do way more justice to the Marine Corps and the invasion. The author needs to tone down his self promotion. Having been a Marine (infantry officer) I can say no true leader like Col McCoy would put up with this especially not from a Ssgt. Not worth your time and not an accurate depiction of the Marine Corps.
1,this is bad fiction,"This is bad fiction - I have never met a col. who would treat someone 15 years his jr as an equal - nice trynever knew a ""sniper"" who fired from the top of a hummer"
1,shooter?,"In short, How can anybody be this good at shooting with one hand on himself and the other on the trigger?More on the Marines and less of the I,I,I,Me,Me,Me"
1,Ronald Oveson,Apparently you didn't kill enough of them loser! Don't be jealous with the new warriors.<>
1,lame,this is an awful book anyone who says other wise dosen't read much.Big fan of first hand war accounts with the exception of this one.Don't waste your money.
5,A really great book ! Women will probably not like it......,"A really great book! This guy was in the thick of it again and again....... US solders are alive today because of this guy, both because of his individual efforts - grippingly told - and his leadership. It's about war.... and Women will probably not like it......"
2,STICK TO SNIPING,"I bought this book with high hopes. I groaned at the bravado of the opening sentence. I had thought that snipers were self-effacing, quiet, unassuming types, not chest beaters like these guys, but who knows? I had anticipated a rapid narrative but around page 80 boredom set in, and then I ran across this chapter-opening sentence: ""There's nothing like a good war to get your adrenaline pumping."" Or a good cigar. ""And giant butterflies were bumping around in my stomach."" Who edits these books at St. Martin's, a monkey? I read that last sentence while waiting in line at the DMV, and I stepped out of line and dumped the book in the trash. Nothing a sniper or a marine can say to my mind can overcome this kind of hacking at the language."
3,Could have been great!,"This book COULD have been one of the best ever - the man certainly has a story to tell. Being a sniper and writing a book are two separate things - and the publisher could have done a much better job keeping the author focused and editing the manuscript. The events don't really flow together, the characters never fully develop, and a lot of information is squeezed into a small space. Here's to hoping Mr. Coughlin chooses to write another book - spending more time on weaving a story that flows from chapter to chapter."
2,It's really pretty bad.,"The writing is unnecessarily ""over-wrought"" and the guy is such a megalomaniac it's shocking. I mean I am no military expert, but I'm shocked that I hadn't heard of this guy before since he basically won the whole war for us."
5,Outstanding!,"This is an Outstanding book! I am a former Marine and bought the book after seeing a friend who was reading it. After reading a few pages, I couldn't put it down. It's an easy read, filled with stories of the Marine Corps and Jack's assignments.A must read for Marines and anyone interested in combat.JoeNew Orleans, LA."
3,Shooter,"As a memoir of war, this is shallow in almost every way possible, and as a memoir of a sniper it's a flat out bore. There is nothing of psychological interest in this book, unless you read it as an instance for the study of superficial, tough-guy story telling."
3,not bad....,guess truth isnt as exciting as fiction. Kyle Swanson books are easier and faster read. question the truthfulness of it after reading reviews.
1,Head Shot,Mr. Coughlin didn't need to shoot all those enemy soldiers. If he had just talked to them for ten minutes they would have shot themselves.
1,BEWARE!!,What is in the pictures is not what will be shipped to you. The blue packaged Fuji's pictured are made in Japan by Taiyo Yuden and are of the highest quality. What will be shipped to you are the vastly inferior made in Taiwan media in the gold package. I even called BEFORE ORDERING and was assured by customer service that what was pictured is what I am being shipped. HUGE INCONVENIENCE that could have been avoided by simply checking the bin to see what was being shipped that obviously wasn't done when I called before I ordered. I think they call it bait and switch or false advertising. You decide.
2,Yawn......,"This cd was...well... yawn. There is only so much one can take with the monotone singing tone and music that never seems to change, speed up, get interesting. This is a cd that I would listen to if I needed something to help me fall asleep. I am a big fan of neo-soul, but this is a bit much."
4,3 Chords & The Truth,"Soulful delivery, honest grown-folks lyrics - what more can one ask for? I'm sorry I took so long to get this album but I'm fortunate I was able to get a copy. Anthony David reminds me a lot of Musiq Soulchild in that neither is the ""perfect"" vocalist but their heartfelt delivery of their songs more than makes up for that. This album is a good representation of soul music with the beautiful music arrangements & live instrumentation. It's also really nice to hear a man sing lyrics like this - expressing honest emotions in a non-mushy or disrespectful way.Over time my favorite tracks are: YES (both versions), BELIEVE ME, SPITTIN' GAME (both versions), SKYLINE, 50/50 LOVE, AIN'T ENOUGH FOR ME and GA PEACH (remix version).Tracks that I appreciate moreso for the honest lyrics are: KROOKED KOP & CHEATIN' MAN.This is a very good album and I'm looking forward to hearing more from this talented young man."
5,Where's the competition ?,"This is what it's all about; since the Clash vacated their crown there's been a void in the music scene that's been fleetingly filled by a few bands, early Public Enemy, Janes Addiction, Living Colour, Nirvana and Manic St Preachers to name a few, however some shockingly bad attempts at ""punk"" have been shifting millions of units to the kids, god knows why when there's a band like China Drum out there, if they don't make it then there's no hope for this generation. This albumn is faultless, ""fiction of life"" is an anthem for the late nineties, ""Down by the River"", ""60 Seconds"" what a record, and I foolishly thought that their cover of ""Wuthering heights"" couldn't be bettered before the millenium, well they've written a whole albumn to prove me wrong."
4,what a fun lil punk band,"China Drum are a fun take on punk. Like Biz Markee next to Puff Daddy, they stand next to the self-seriousness of their British predecessors and guffaw. Sure they sound serious sometimes, but the pop mixed into the tracks belies a sense of humor. They have a great time being loud. Madness and Sex Pistols thrown together."
3,"Good,But Not For The Beginner.","If you're looking to learn how to play upright bass take my advise and buy Todd Phillips ""Essential Techniques for Acoustic Bass"" videos one and two before spending your money on this one. In this video Lee Rocker demonstrates the three different slaps used,then applies them to a couple of rockabilly bass lines. No fundamentals are explained, nor are any basic scales illustrated. Rocker's demonstrations are also a bit too fast for a beginner to follow along to. In short,this video won't be beneficial to the beginner. It's more intended for an intermediate bass player who's looking to develope the rockabilly slap technique. Get a few months of playing under your belt first before buying this one."
1,DONT DO IT!,"For the love of GOD, DO NOT BUY THIS! It is unbelievably bad. Go to any upright bass forum and search for lee rocker and you will see that this video is the red-headed stepchild of bass instruction."
2,Not impressed with video,"Production of video is not student friendly, every time there is a particular thing you want to learn, (triplets, rapid slap technique, etc.) the camera moves to rockers face not his hands. You can't see what his hands are doing"
1,May not fit all - I would order directly from Hoover,"Very disappointed, this did not fit.Same size just nothing to secure it to stay put. Most reviews said it fit.Model # 7440-980 If you have this model, it will not fit!"
5,Whoo Hoo!,This tank is so much better than the original. I used to have problems getting the old one. It was taking a few tries before it would click. This one goes on first try. I'm so glad our old one broke.
1,another defective tank,"This is my second tank that leaks, mixes soap and clean water in the clean water tank. I am not sure what to do now."
4,Saved me from buying a new machine,"I bought the Hoover Dual V a couple of years ago. After about ten uses, it began to leak. I took a chance that this new solution tank would solve my problem. It did. I thought I was going to have to chuck this one and buy a new steam vac. Glad this part was available. Could have been a little less expensive."
5,Fit right in,"Was exactly what we needed to replace our tank. It has held up, even though I had reservations it would not. It arrived with a few ""pieces"" on it which we did not need, and once we moved them, it fit well. I guess it has some various pieces on it to fit different models."
4,Great Replacement,I bought this replacement tank and it fits perfectly and works great. I have used it twice now without issue.
3,cute and fun,"An easy fun read for when you don't want to think too much. Good descriptions and mood setting. Almost a perfect job of convincing the reader you are in the fifties. The ""little woman"" sydrome got a little old. But I guess it's hard for me to identify with a woman from back then."
5,"Fun, intelligent, a great read","This is a great 'fun' read for when you're looking for something not too heavy but definitely not a book that insults your intelligence. The period milieu is quite authentic (I checked with some people who lived through the 50's), Paige is a great heroine-- smart, resourceful and energetic, the kind of girl you'd want as a friend. It seems to me the author had a lot of fun writing this and it shows; I know I had a lot of fun reading it."
2,OK for a YA book,"The Star Ghost, while I guess acceptable to younger kids, is really not very good. While technically it's ok, the author doesn't seem to have a feel for DS9. He makes Jake a bumbling fool who needs everything spelled out for him, an idiot who can't figure out his algebra homework without Nog's help, and who is constantly drinking ""chocolate malted""s and eating hamburgers or steak. There is some interesting humor, but most of it is just cheap-gags obviously meant for little kids, but which they probably wouldn't find funny anyway. The back story is minutely interesting, but I'd recommend only buying this book if you're a collector"
1,"Poor design, no customer service","The strainer would not let the water out. The product is poorly designed. Emailed customer service, but got no reply."
1,unsatisfactory service from Opella,"I ordered this item from Opella in June, was told it was on backorder, started calling again in September, and kept getting different stories about whether it was or was not in stock, when they would receive another shipment, when they would fill my order, etc., until I finally canceled the order in mid-October.I was very disappointed and frustrated in the entire interaction, and would not recommend Opella products to anyone I know."
1,stay away,"I bought this white opella sink strainer on line because I could not find one locally. I had it installed by a local plumber i trust and it would not drain. I called and e mailed opella and they were clearly not interested in helping, nor was the amazon approved vendor i bought it from. Call the plumber, pay him again and pay for another strainer (certainly not opella) Not a good experience."
4,Good mindless fun,I'm a busy 40 year old who was looking for a game that I could jump into for 20 minutes before bedtime for some relaxation. The Simpson's game fits the bill for the PS3.The good:-balanced gameplay-not too easy or hard-good puzzles-well written story with lots of 'inside' gags-cell shaded graphics looks just right for the Simpson's worldThe bad:-Several of the cut scenes had some PG language that disqualifies it from being a kids game (can't turn them off).-people under 30 probably won't get some of the gameplay gags. Not to ruin the surprises but there are some 80's arcade homage's to be found.
3,Its intersesting but may want to skip,"I bought it on the statements of other reviewers saying if you're a Simpson's fan its a must for $24 I went with it.......I agree if you're fan you will like the atmosphere and feeling of being in Springfield with many characters through out and episode jokes, but its a puzzle game, which wouldn't be so bad, but the game play is frustrating due to limited camera angles and not much action per say. played it a few times when I first got it but you lose interest in it, so i don't really play it any more and have yet to beat it."
4,Fun but quick,"This was a fun game, and very funny like the show. Overall very impressed with the game. My only compaint is that I beat it in about a week while not even playing for extended hours. The main game goes by quick. After the main game you can go back and do the levels again trying to beat times to get trophies and find all the hidden stuff for more trophies, that will keep you busy for awhile after you beat it."
2,Ok game for Simpsons fans otherwise don't waste your money,"Ok, I've been a Simpsons fan for bout 20 years now so there's definitly a certain level of excitement to play them in a video game. The characters do, for the most part, stay true to the show, and there are many funny clips that are enjoyable. The fun, however, stops here. The gameplay is very poor, and for me, extremely frustrating. It pretty much plays like a low-budget game with poor camera angles, sub-par graphics, and annoying and pointless tasks. Even as a Simpsons fan, I can only give this game 1-2 stars. Good to have as a novelty, but if you're looking for a good time, look elsewhere."
2,I expected better,"I expected better, i wanted to see 3 molds of them instead there 2d- ish, and i was fine with that untill i found out the button play is limited to 3 butttons, it told me one thing this was going to be a Very BOring game, and guess what it was,"
4,Fun for the kids,Bought this for my daughter (8 years old) and loves this game. It's a great incentive to finish up the homework so she can play with dad (two players at a time option). highly recommend for those rainy days.
4,A nice way to spend your time,There are a couple things I liked about this game. First is that it reminded me of the good old days of the Simpsons when it was still good. It was also very playable. Many of the levels are logic puzzles and that is a refreshing change from the generic shoot em'ups that have come out. Much was less complex than I would have liked but understandable since it is designed mainly for kids.Overall it is worth the time and money
2,Not much fun,Not much fun at all and a bit too difficult & crude for my 6 year old for whom it was intended.
5,beiker,I really liked the speed of arrival .. consider to be very good .. fectivamente I recommend them to all ... excellent work. thanks
4,A good game for fans,"It's an average 3D platform action-adventure game. It has some terrible camera problems. But that said, it's a Simpsons game, and if you're a fan of the show you'll enjoy it. The script is good, with some genuinely funny moments. There are some fun parodies of other video games."
3,"Fun, but graphics are sub-par","This game is a blast for any Simpsons fan, but the graphics should have been taken up a notch for the PS3. The graphics are no better than PS2 or an old Xbox."
1,EDITED PRINT - Shriek Show Screws Up Again!,"Yep, that DVD company that just can't get it right strikes again!WARLOCK MOON - a fun little independent 70's horror flick finally sees the light of day on DVD. And thanks to Shriek Show, the version we now have is CUT! Over 10 minutes of the film are cut out! Unbelievable! Thanks Shriek Show - for nothing!Do not support this shoddy release. Seek out the old UNCUT vhs version from Unicorn Video instead."
3,Interesting extrapolation from a real-life case.,"Few people remember a book called ""The Fifty-Minute Hour"" by Dr. Robert Lindner (who also wrote ""Rebel Without A Cause""), but the story of prot was originally based on a famous case detailed in that book.The fictional prot (protagonist?) was mislabeled with ""multiple personalities"", because at the time Brewer was writing, this quite real condition was being used as a grab-bag diagnosis for everything doctors couldn't figure out. However, in real life, the alien visitor simply got tired of writing reams of scientific detail to prove his bona fides to the doctor, and declared himself cured of his own delusions."
4,A must to ...,"A must to any Science Fiction and Fantasy lover. Though the psychological descriptions may look a little outdated in those days of SOMA for all, the book brings out many interesting questions, and some of the answers. It makes you keep reading the next books (which I'm going to do now...)."
2,GIVE K-PAX AN X-LAX!,"COULDA BEEN A CONTENDER (BUT DIDN'T GO ANYWHERE)...COULDA BEEN A NOVEL (BUT PETERED OUT)...COULDA BEEN A WORTHWHILE READ (BUT HIT ITS HIGH POINT EARLY AND WENT NOWHERE THEREAFTER...)NICE WRITING BUT PLOT WAS UNFINISHED OR POORLY THOUGHT-OUT.I CONSIDER MYSELF A SUCKER FOR THIS GENRE BUT SUGGEST YOU AVOID THIS BOOK UNLESS YOU ENJOY BEING LET-DOWN AND LEFT UNFULFILLED!TO THE AUTHOR....KEEP TRYING, YOU'LL GET THERE. JUST NOT THIS TIME."
4,Wonderful quick read - great gift for ages teen to adult!,"Not being a major science fiction buff, this wasn't number one on my list of books to read. But after my 17 year old son read it and said it was ""really great"", I picked it up and stayed up till 5 am to finish it. And I had to admit it was not only a well-written and totally engaging mystery about a man who may or may not be an alien from another plant - but also one of the more thought-provoking books I've read in months. Even reluctant readers should enjoy this one!One minor quibble and it isn't the author's fault - the book has been made into a move and before reading this book, I'd seen the media blitz on televison and movie trailers for the movie, featuring Kevin Spacey as alien Prot. So I couldn't read the book without envisioning Spacey as Prot. This is not necessarily a bad thing, but I prefer to use my imagination to picture characters. Other than that, I found this to be a wonderful book."
4,Great insight into our culture.,"This book offers a very cool way of looking at our culture as a human being (among many other factors). I read it in one sitting, as it reads very easy. A nice afternoon read for all those philosophy majors out there."
3,"A quick, interesting read","I was able to easily finish off this novel in less than a few hours. The story line was enjoyable, but I felt the ending was rushed and easily explained...I would have rather had it a bit more drawn-out. I am glad to see they are making a movie of this novel, because I think Kevin Spacey would make a great prot.I am also interested to see where the author will take this story in his sequel. I also didn't get it until the very end that the author used his name as the novel's psychiatrist...I thought it made this work of fiction even more interesting."
3,Plagiarism?,"I have not read Gene Brewer's book and do not know whether he has acknoledged this fact, but its premise is the same as that of a 1980s South American film called ""The Man Facing Southeast."" Neither the film company nor (so far as I can tell) any reviewers have pointed this out. The parallels are, I think, much too close to be attributed to coincidence. I hope that more people will look into this. If you cannot find the movie anywhere, it is easy to read a synopsis online. ..."
4,Many Beautiful Things:Stories and Recipes frm Polizzi Generosa,"This was a book I knew my son would like. He is a very good cook and particularly enjoys preparing Italian food. In addition, he is partly Sicilian and proud of it."
4,So Far So Good,I recently bought this book mostly due to the fact it was by Vincent Schiavelli who I really liked as an actor.I am still rather shocked that he has passed away but I am glad I have got one of his books and I could consider getting another one.So far in the book it has stories and some nice recipes.Vincent shall live on forever even though I will miss not seeing him on the screen.It is already something I will hold on to for all of my life.I love the fact that actors do this by making there own cooking books.I did always want to meet Vincent Schiavelli and it is a shame I never will however having a book or two of his books could be as close to as I will get.
4,Exactly what it is shown,"This is a replacement for the same. the 1st one lasted a couple of years, the chrome faded from exposure to soap and detergent and the spout being rusted and plugged up.Franke dispenser looks great , works great but it's very pricey for a factory mass item."
5,This CD is a must have if you are a Wes King fan!,"This album, which is Wes King's first he ever made sounds a bit different from his most recent work, but still displays the talent he has."
2,The spark of life,"This book starts out fine as to laying out the different scenarios for life's origins , but one has to read it cautiously because it is filled with the biases of the authors, occasionally lacking a balanced scientific perspective on the origins of life."
2,Enthusiam,"The best thing about Orbiter is Warren Ellis' impassioned forward. I have doubts about the space program, myself. I believe in pure science and exploration, but I can't help but wonder what we might be able to do with that money on the earth's surface, when so many people are so impoverished. Still, Ellis' arguments catch my imagination, and I hope we can afford both.The story itself... well, it's a lesser work. Hard-SF speculation about gravity drives and relativity isn't my cup of tea, though Doran and Stewart do an admirable job of infusing the panels with inspiration and momentum. I feel like the living-spaceship concept has been done too many times for the extended treatment of it here. There wasn't much of a plot or a resolution. As always, Ellis gives us some lovely moments and some great lines, but it didn't add up this time. Stunning cover."
1,This Sucks Totally Slow & Borringgggggggggggggggggggggg,"I'm sure I will get ""this review didn't help me"" comments but this tpb sucks. I usually like Warren Ellis but this book was so slow and boring and had no real punch. No aliens, nada. Thank God I got it cheap here. It was probably sold so cheap because it sucked. Anyway, don't waste your money on this. Totally slow & boring reading."
3,Tickles the imagination but lets down without sequel,"The story captures the passion and some magic decently well. The dirty look of the artwork really lent it a unique feel. But there were quick cuts where key scenes were given short treatment, likely on purpose, which I felt let the story down. Some parts of the story makes no sense mostly the end bits. I kept thinking where is security?!The end scene finally tied it all together and made the story somewhat worth reading, but unfortunately there appears to be no sequel or series planned. This book explored so little of the characters where it seemed it was just the setup to a big series that would reveal all of the characters, but it appears to be standalone.I still liked it, but it could have benefited from a sequel."
3,Decent Comic,"Not as in-depth as his work on Transmet, Planetary or Hellblazer, but a decent comic. Neat idea, but I would have liked a bit more characterization."
1,Awful.,The kids sound so auto tuned they sound like crazy cartoon characters. I wish I could return this! Not even my 2 year old likes it.
5,Just what I wanted!,"Fun kids' Christmas CD! Several songs I've never heard, but includes all of the favorites!"
3,too many oldies,songs are good but not enough children singing and the children singing sound really young like 3- 4- 5 yrs old
4,Good but lyrics don't always match up with the official songs,"I bought this for my students to sing along for a music performance since we don't have a music teacher to provide accompaniment. It's a great CD, and the kids loved it. The only issue is that sometimes the lyrics don't quite match up with the song, and it got so confusing for the kids I couldn't use it for their sing-along. They do enjoy listening to it, however."
3,Countdown Kids got replaced,"This album is advertised as ""Performed by The Countdown Kids"" but it does not sound like the same kids that perform on ""100 Songs for Kids"" which is a much better compilation that I highly recommend. These singers sound like adults singing in falsetto or maybe The Countdown Kids just grew up. I much prefered the previous singers, bring them back."
5,Family members needing educating,"Definately a book that family members should read. Even though family members may be very close to someone with cf, there is still that denial that comes with cystic fibrosis, ""he/she looks great"". If this book had been around when my son was younger, I would have made sure that certain family members had their own copy to read."
4,Great for little ones,"This food dispenser does it's job. My seven-year-old can use it and it's fairly neat. It doesn't crush up the cereal too much. We use it for Cheerios and I think it would work well for cereal of a similar size, but not much bigger. Also, I think flakes would do very poorly in it. It will hold a full, standard box, but not the larger boxes."
1,Don't buy this book if you want to learn how to batik,"Discussion of the history of batik is very through, unfortunately, that is not what I was looking for. Also, photos are black and white, and not easy to follow.The section discussion how to batik is relatively small compared to the material in the book, and not easy to follow, as the photos are black and white and somewhat small. I recommend Creative Batik over this book, if you want to learn how to batik."
5,Love this book,I have been doing tie dyes for years and still found this book very helpful. The instructions are very detailed and accurate. Every one should have this book.
2,Bland and Boring,"When I received this book I was extremely disappointed to see that ALL this illustrations were black and white. The book is about batik and tie dye, two textiles techniques that are all about colour, yet the entire book is black and white. Could the author/publishers not afford to print in colour? The information is good, but written in a technical manner that I soon got bored with. The book did make me get exited about batik or tie dye. I would never have spent money on this book if I had seen it in a store."
3,practical book,A very straight forward practical book. Batik and Tie Dye Techniques focus' on the beginner's needs for basic tie-dye stuff.
4,not too bad!,"If you like ""Prince"" Pasta this is a good substitute....it tastes almost exactly like it....the only difference is it smells a little like rice....But it is very good!"
5,pure magic,"For me this is a long time coming and the first time since I'd heard Faust's Rien that I believe I've encountered real magic. This is scarcely imaginable and inexorably human--primitive and strikingly modern. It took me two listens, about two years apart, to truly comprehend this ""music"" enough to realize how massive it is. Here, free jazz is merely a hazy reference point from an seemiingly infinite number of points of influence that coalesce together in an unbelievable way. These natural sounds: human voices, various instruments, and electronic devices occur in a manner that suggests structure and forward motion, but only a very fragile symetry. This must be heard and comprehended before one can truly grasp the significance of this artform."
5,Da Costa Woltz's Southern Broadcasters,Short but sweet. AN AWESOME WORK OF ART. It is a great collection of of Georgia banjo music. An absolute must have. I love it.
5,~My two cents worth~,"I'd like to be brief: if you wish to know what Midnight Oil has stood for, watch this. It's a wonderful live set, taking place symbolically in front of the Exxon building in NY. ""I love it when the suits clap""~~(hello, Midnight oil:)To live, you must be willing to risk. ""Don't give in..."""
1,"Only 1 blanket, not 12!","Much to my utter amazement, I received only 1 blanket, not 12 as advertised. Ironically, what I received is exactly what is shown in the picture, it's just that the item is small, and not a package of multiple blankets.Why in the world would I pay $18.95 for a single blanket????Otherwise it's a perfectly fine 62"" x 82"" mylar blanket, but I am amazed that I was charged for 12, the descriptions says 12, and I received 1.If I could give 0 stars (or -1 stars) I would."
5,Great compact packaging!,"Love how each comes individually wrapped in a small form so it can be stored in a glove compartment, pocket, etc. Great deal for the price of about a buck per."
5,great window covers,"I bought these to cover the windows on an enclosed south facing porch during the summer. I cut them to size and applied with packing tape around the frames. They definitely lower the temp in that room, although it still gets very warm in there at least now it's tolerable. They do block a bit of the sunlight, I'd say around 25% lower light in the room but it's worth it. These are strong and won't tear until you cut them, then they tear very easily once even a tiny cut is started. I'll also be stashing some of these in the car and my backpack. They're extremely compact and lightweight and economical. Each comes in its own little ziploc bag and you could easily fit two or three of them in the back pocket of your jeans."
2,Lyrically well crafted but musically not Rich's best,"I was very disappointed in this as a musical work. Rich's lyrics are as powerful as ever but as a musician he was so far ahead of his time that because of his acoustical style, I honestly think Reunion Records did not do his musical genuis justice this time. For hard core Rich fans this is a must addition but for those who are more interested in the way a song is crafted I can't recommend this one. I think Rich himself said that ""Awesome God"" is the worst song musically he'd ever done and I'd give my arms and legs to have him back among us but Rich's technique and sound improved like good wine with age. This is honestly the least favorite of all he's done.(musically - not lyrically)"
3,Music Great CD Not So Much,"The music is as awesome as it ever was, but while I knew this was an official copy and not a copy of the original release, I thought it would be an actual copy of the paperwork too. Part of the original cover photo is covered with that blue border and there are no lyrics or credits listed inside, only a plug for the company that copied the CD. I think it's over priced for what you get, and I think I'll order a good used copy of the original CD."
5,Totally awesome !,"I first heard of Rich Mullins after his death with the release of ""The Jesus Record"". I borrowed this CD from a friend, and was very reluctant to give it back. The lyrics are powerful, and the melodies are moving- we have lost a great musician."
5,The best of Rich Mullins' early work. Got to have this one.,"I purchased this album first in 1988 at a Rich Mullins Concert at a small baptist church. Thisis excellent contemporary worship music. I now have an extensive collection of his work, this album is among the best."
4,Great Basic Dict.,"Kodansha rarely fails to dissapoint and this is no excepetion. Although the vocabulary listed is quite simple, the definitions and usage examples are some of the most extensive I've seen. Say goodbye to bad syntax with this dictionary, it won't let you use a new word wrong! However, my only complaint is the limited number of vocab, which is easily compensated for in other areas. If you're looking for sheer number of listed words though, try Kodansha's Furigana E-J/J-E dictionary...it's GREAT too! This dict. has an attractive presentation and overall a solid buy for beginners. Ganbatte yo!"
5,Halfway through review,"So far I rate this book 5 stars. I am also writing a book on this topic, and one of the most compelling reasons I have encountered for the decriminalization of substances is the situation in Iran. There dealers of Heroin have been subjected to the death penalty, and the traffic is unabated. As mentioned in this book and other sources, the harsher the penalties, the greater the profits. In every society there are persons so desperate and lacking in education and opportunities that death itself is no deterrent to such profit. In our (US) society recently a former chief of police in Los Angeles said that even casual users should be shot. He did not include cigarette smokers or beer drinkers. Fanatics are not often troubled by attacks of logic.Abraham Lincoln said Prohibition laws run contrary to the principles upon which the United States was founded. He is one of George W. Bush's heroes. Dubya seems not to have read his hero."
5,A war that can't be won and shouldn't be waged.,"The most commonly used drugs, marijuana and cocaine, are victimless and their use shouldn't be crimes. Treating them a a danger just fills up prisons, runs careers and lives and wastes money that could be better spent in other ways."
5,Awesome!,"Love anything Tim Burton. Movies for kids of all ages, with some deep underlying thinkers. Toys share his amazement of capturing the soul of his movies."
3,Not a love story,"This is the first book by HH I have read and if it is a true sample of her work it will be the last.Although the story line was adventureous and compelling the main character, Royal was not the ""man of honor"" and ""gentleman"" the author touted him to be. This is a classic story of a man who can't commit. Royal hardly knew is own mind, let alone had the ability to make decisions that affected the lives of everyone on his ranch. I couldn't finish it because I couldn't respect such a moral and emotional coward."
4,New Age Musicians World,"Ui's Lifelike is totally out of time and out of actual fashion. The three Ui's musicians make us enter in their little world. If you like some free-jazz-progressive rock, you can easily go for it. The drum is always there with a tipical dry sound, the line of bass sounds very good and the small cheap sound effects are very relaxing. It's quiet, it's fresh, it's all the way good for the fan of new jazz-rock bands."
4,Fishing for Tuna and Marlin,"Cuando hice la compra de este libro lo considere como un libro que me hiba a mostrar muchas imagenes de tuna y marlin, pero que no iba a ser educativo. Caso error, el libro es educativo...y debo considerar que todo pescador offshore debe tenerlo. Puntos importantes son los que se refieren a los tipos de señuelos artificiales y el armado del aparejo terminal.Para aquellos que están interesados en hacerse de una embarcación o que deseen desarrollar una empresa de charter de pesca deportiva es un libro que te inicia en la valoración del bote adecuado y sus accesorios.El libro muestra las estrategias y lo más importante el por qué de emplearlas. Ahora bien, la única carencia que observo es que no aplica el uso de anzuelos circulares...creo que ello se debe exclusivamente a una comportamiento cultural (los estadounidenses) y no con una visión de la conservación del recurso"
1,HocuPocus,"Still one of the cutest , cleanest holloween movie. In fact I no longer have small children at home yet continue to enjoy it year after year out of pure nostalgia.Thanks for making it available,Nora"
1,Lame movie,"These are some very LAME CGI werewolves ; They should have just had a guy in a werewolf suit. Lame CGI ruins a movie for me , and these are cartoonishly BAD. The story might have been OK if it were'nt for the aweful werewolves. Don't buy / rent it if you must , but not worth the money at all."
3,Werewolf,It's just another B rated horror flick. It's still hard to beat the the old classic werewolf movie.Chaney is still the best.
2,Boring,"Some of these low budget movies make up for it with a good story, not this one, it just didn't seem to go anywhere."
2,Shame on Universal.,i am always wary of straight to video movies and rarely expect much but when i heard universal was going to work on putting their monsters into that market i was a little excited. Maybe after the costly idiocy of van helsing they learned something... Wrong. this is just bad storytelling with less money and worse acting (Rea gets a pass on this). How can they continue to mistreat big properties like the universal monsters? Find some people who can make a monster movie...please. The originals are good because they were taken serious with top notch talent and money.
1,The worst among us,"A very low budget movie, common werewolf story line but could have done better. It's nowhere near red riding hood."
1,Amazon - Really?,"When you watch as much TV as I do, you know a good movie within the first five minutes. You also know a bad movie. Where do these flicks come from? I guess anyone can make a movie these days."
5,WEREWOLF: THE BEAST AMONG USI,I am someone who loves horror movies. This movie had a wonderful twist to it!Especially the part about the vampire towards the end.I never saw it coming. I thought it was just werewolves.
5,Werewolf: The Beast Among Us,Great movie! I thoroughly enjoyed the twist in the storyline. I loved the costumes and the setting. It was well acted. I look forward to watching it again.
2,so corny,"This movie sucked so bad, and it wasn't even worth watching. I would not recommend it to anyone because it had little excitment, and it was really corny. The main characters in the movie weren't even cute, total let down. The two star rating I gave this movie was very generous on my part."
2,Wow! D+ For this movie!,"Let me start this review by listing some things that make this movie horrible!1. Amature acting2. Movie is supposed to be set in the 19th century but it has a flame thrower, goggles, modern throwing knives and a modern revolver!3. Some of the dialog is too modern like ""She has nothing on you""!4. Werewolf and werewolves are obvious cgi's5. Stealth and camouflage This wasnt even used in ww1 no longer anytime in the 19th century!Despite all of the flaws and mistakes both historical and technical. I found this to be a movie that is slightly entertaining and I watched it with curiosity.A few tips to the filmmakers of this movie.1. Next time hire actors not random people you pick off the street who want to be a actor.2. Get your historical facts right! Do some bloody research!3. Use better cgi software!4. Spend more money to get it done right!"
4,Enjoyable gore,"Enjoyable gore fest, unusual to see Stephen Rae in this type of filmSlightly different slant on the usual story lines"
3,An Okay watch,"I was hoping this would be a decent Werewolf movie because of the graphics and movie capabilities that are available these days. Well, I was wrong. The story was okay, the acting was better and but the werewolf was not. However, if you are a werewolf fan and want something to watch that isn't dated 1980's, then have at it. :)"
3,WereWolf Movie...,"I have seen just about every WereWolf movie ever made & have many of them in my collection. This one was not what I thought it to be, But I did enjoy Stephen Rea, He is a great actor. Maybe in the future someonewill put together a WereWolf movie that people will really enjoy and say now that was a WereWolf movie. Untilthen Lon Chaney Jr,,, where are you. The movie is good but three stars is all it get's from me... Thank's Much."
3,"An ""ok"" addition to the werewolf genre","The movie relies to heavily on mediocre cgi for the creature, but it's still enjoyable to watch. The story offers an interesting twist on the usual ""werewolf movie"" plot line. Some of the acting is wooden, but that's to be expected from unknown actors on a direct-to-dvd project. Recommended for die hard werewolf movie fans."
2,Werewolf,"Poor ""B"" quality movie. From the previews I expected a much better production. Acting and photography was very low quality."
4,Werewolf Review,"The movie was as expected. It was comprised of parts that were ""predictable"", unpredictable and contained some scenes that were 'scary'. Not the best werewolf movie I have seen, and not the worst. I would watch it again."
3,NOT the Wolfman continued,"Though the product itself came well packaged and was brand new,(no issues with the product), the ""movie"" is about as close to a ""B"" type as you can get without actually calling it a B. The gore factor is high, the actors performances were fairly good, and the score is decent. The werewolf is absolutely of cartoon quality. Lots of CG and very predictable story line. Though i had read previews of this straight to dvd movie and knew it wasn't a ""Wolfman"" 2, it was indeed a very poor excuse for a Universal horror flick.Incidentally, I'm one of the few - it seems, that think that The Wolfman, Starring Benicio Del Toro, Anthony Hopkins, and Emily Blunt was a fantastic Universal remake of the old classic."
4,Werewolf: The Beast Among Us...,"This movie is a very well produced, very unique take on the traditional werewolf theme. Lots of blood, tons of gore....it's the ""Walking Dead"" meets the Werewolf in sheer carnage. Great action sequences and an intirguing plot tie it all together. It's well worth your time!"
3,Not bad at all.,"Not a bad movie and definitely worth watching! While it is a bit of a knock off of Red Riding Hood, it was still an entertaining move and worth the rental or purchase price."
5,Fangs & hair and bad doggies!,"So, this is an old style werewolf movie. Set in a fictional Europe of washed out greys. No sex, little pathos and certainly no glittery vamps. The hunting team is a classic D&D group with different temperaments and specialties who crack jokes and work well as a team. If you liked movies like Deep Rising or Slither or Jaws for that matter you will like this one. I watched it on Netflix and ended up buying it on Blu ray."
3,we need more werewolf movies,"This movie is not great but it's not terrible either, sadly we don't get enough werewolf movie so if your in the mood for a werewolf movie this movie might satisy the craving but dont expect much as there is no real charactor development nor a real indepth story. it is not scary nor particuly gorryI give this movie 5/10"
3,BEAST FOOT FOREWARD,"Universal Studios is credited for starting the ""classic"" horror icons---Frankenstein, Dracula, and of course, the Wolfman. So it's only natural they would be the ones to reboot the werewolf storyline. The movie captures much of the villagers-carrying-torches mania of those vintage classics, also attempting to add modernistic flourishes. Sadly, THE BEAST AMONG US doesn't really add anything new to the genre nor does its production values set any new standards in film-making. Fortunately, it is entertaining in its own limited way, the cast is likeable and its an adequate diversion."
1,Dreadful,"Unimaginative, terrible special effects, poor acting. How do films like this get made?? I can't recommend it to anyone over the age of ten."
1,Two Thumbs Down!,Yuck! Just plain o'l boring! Could not even finish watching it. Lost interest very quickly. But if you like B-Movies this is the one for you.
3,good service from the seller,"I purchased this battery, it was slightly smaller than needed, it didn't fit the phone and kept falling out and not charging, I contacted the seller, item was returned and I received a full refund.Product rating 1 star, service provided 5 stars."
3,Great Jewish Men Forgot Albert Einstein,"I think the book was ok, but it left out a very important jewish person. That important person is Albert Einstein. As I finished this book I realized that it did not have Albert Einstein in it. That was very dissapointing. So, in conlusion, I would give this book 3 stars because it left out the amazing Albert Einstein."
4,Great for a brief history,"This book is an excellent book. It covers information about many different men who have played important roles in Judaism, from Abraham to David Ben Gurion. The book is good if you are looking for a 2-3 page biography and certain highlights of a person's career, but could not be used as an only reference for a research project.Overall, the Slaters have created a good book documenting important aspects of Jewish history."
