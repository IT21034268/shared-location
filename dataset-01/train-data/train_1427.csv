2,Do you really need this for class?,"I would ask your instructor before purchasing this book. This consists of worksheets that outline the text book exactly, you just fill in the blanks. I would nix the idea of the workbook if you are not required to have it for homework assignments."
4,Good,I like the book. Its a good story and I like the way she describes her life. I love Isabel Allende's works. In my opinion she is one of the most important Latin American writers.
3,I am very pleased,"I am very pleased that i can find books in spanish, because in bookstores here in greece i can't find."
2,No es muy bueno... It's not as good as the others.,"Compre este libro porque habia escuchado que era bueno. Pero me lleve una gran decepcion. A pesar de que su hija esta muriendo, ella cuenta muchas historias de su familia y hace unas descripciones que realmente no tienen nada que ver con lo que le esta pasando a su hija."
4,I love Latin jazz,If you are a fan on latin jazz with a soul flavor then I highly recommend this cd to you great song selections and the disc never gets boring.
5,great rug,Fantastic looking and very soft. Looks much better in person than in the picture.Prompt delivery. Rug is put together well. Worth it!
1,Deer Hunter: Original Motion Picture Soundtrack,I can not review the album because the Realplayer I downloaded took all night to download and then would NOT play the samples. Can you help me ? germo@jps.net
2,A Huge Disappointment for a wonderful movie score,"All I can say is what a ripoff. I think this soundtrack runs less than 15 minutes--what a lost opportunity. Not only are the scores way too short--but the most two vital songs/socres--""I Love you Baby--not only at the tavern but also as part of the wedding festivals--and even more importantly, the score whose name I don't know--after the deer hunt and the most poignant moment in the films--the score in the tavern where a classical piece is played and all the boys go into the deepest moments of intimacy in the entire film--none of this is part of the sound track.I love the film, looked forward to the soundtrack--and felt I (and others) were totally ripped off."
3,what a truly haunting score,"This motion picture had such an emotional impact on me when I saw it back in the early '80s that it left me totally drained, and I was never able to get the haunting guitar out of my head.As far as the music goes on this CD, it wasn't the entire score I was in love with (& needed to hear again), but a yearning, instead, to hear John ""Guitar"" Williams' awesome guitar playing.Unfortunately, you only get three numbers by this great guitarist, three. I still love what the man does, but it is hardly enough.I guess I'll have to either keep playing the same three tunes over and over, or else buy some more CDs by him."
2,It is the real original soundtrack,"Including all the background sound from the movie, too! I had thought it was something fully-fledged music so that I can enjoy the music from the movie that I love."
2,Not good for an M.T.,"This actually starts out a little too uptempo for me, then it goes on to your typical massage type music which is okay but not spellbinding. The tunes are pretty and flow nicely, however the very last track is what makes this a terrible c.d. for any therapist. A man starts saying "" ahhh massage..."" and then goes on to explain how beneficial massage is. If you bought this c.d. and never listened to it and played it for the first time while you were massaging, it would be horrorifying. When the guy says'Ahhhhhh"", its very weird. Yikes, what were they thinking?"
1,Just plain bad,"First, the name of the book is misleading. Event driven trading is about selecting stocks that will or have experienced an 'event' that drives the stock higher or lower. The entirety of this book is just a summary/rehash of several other stock picking books based on technical factors and analysis.That said, the only reason I would recommend this book is for someone who has had no previous exposure to the markets.Good thing I only borrowed this book from the library!"
5,"Brutal, inmense, powerful",Highly recommended for Sabbath hard core fans. Not for the begginers. I heard both cd's and ended on my knees. reworshipping and enjoying once again the true Masters of Metal.
4,Sabbath's Best Live Album!,"An impressive live album! Black Sabbath really puts on a great show, from what I hear on this album, and it's nice to know that the REAL Sabbath fans can appreciate something beyond ""Paranoid"" and ""Iron Man."" A lot of great tracks, here, and the nearly nineteen minute ""Wicked World"" really demonstrates the level of musicianship in this band."
4,Rocks Really Hard!,"I Love Ozzy! He is the best singer songrighter in my opinion. Black Sabbath Have Some great songs on here that i think sound better Live,Snowblind(the cocaine screams add to it) Sweet Leaf, War Pigs and a lot more. but still I think the songs Ozzy wrights in his solo career are much better. I Suggest if you want a live Ozzy CD to buy Tribute."
4,Live at Last Plus More,"As you probably know then entire semi-legit live at last is contained in this album plus a whole lot more of classic sabbath. The sound quality is much improved over the original release. This is a great era of sabbath, and is a fantastic collection of their live material. Plus you get a free guitar pick. If you are a fan of ozzy-sab, this is a must have."
3,....,"No comments about this album, but Ozzy should really be screaming instead of singing, since Heavy Metal is supposed to be loud."
2,The Past Is Better Left in The Past,"I don't see the point in this album. Back in the days before Dio, before MTV, before the VCR many of us diehard Sabbath fans would've have killed for a live Sabbath album. A live album seems to make more sense when the performances are recent (look at the success of Kiss Alive, Made In Japan, The Tokyo Tapes) But years later it seems pointless. These are inferior performances to recent live albums which serve not other purpose than to demonstrate how far they've come and how far technology has come. I advise you to seek Live Evil, which kind of summarized Dio's Heaven and Hell/Mob Rules period of Sabbath (a big improvement for my money)or Reunion, which stands a testament to their longevity and recent tour with the original members. Most of Past Lives sounds like a bootleg. You've heard most of these songs done before and better, with the possible exception of Hole In The Sky and Megalomania from Sabotage. Trust me the Past is better left in the Past"
3,Could Have Been Better,"I was actually pretty disappointed with this CD. After waiting 20 or more years for some unreleased live early Sabbath. I got Live At Last (Disc One) and a bunch of assorted bootleg tracks that I already have. I'm giving it 3 stars because it's Sabbath, but if you already have Live at Last, it's not really worth the money. The second disc has some great stuff on it, but again the tracks are taken from bootleg LP and the quality of sound is just not there. Not to mention there were better tracks they could have used off the same bootlegs. If your like me and have everything Sabbath has ever released then you have to buy it. Otherwise, buy Live at Last & the Reunion CD's and you'll be happier."
3,ok live recording from a great band,"The sound quality on this recording is not very good. There are good recordings of the band live like Never say die"" on dvd but this is just not that well recorded. It's a expansion of ""live at last"" which came out in the early 1980's and was recorded back in the midseventies. It's good to have live music from this band but surely they can release a cd of ""never say die"" so at least we can get a goodlive recording from the seventies. The band of course is excellent and one of the best metal bands ever so you can't go wrong there, but this one is a cd that you should buy last when collecting this group. However the 'live at last' remaster from the 1990's does have some of these songs and they sound at least a little better. Still if you love this band then you'll want this cd set because it is after all the only recording out there so far."
3,Listen for the chopper,"The commonly demure face of indy-rock is not so brutally apparent in the case of Helicopter Helicopter. Produced by Matthew Ellard of Weezer fame, ""Wild Dogs with X-Ray Eyes"" shares characteristic undertones of a Lemonheads release. Despite some thinly winded and slow-paced songs they still stay true to the rhythmic structure of rock and roll; maintaining a semi-melodious approach to the subject material with the addition of a keyboard to the front lines. Technically speaking, the band hits their changes collectively and knows how to play surprisingly well together. The acoustic and sometimes timid vocal tracks are supplemented by unique effects and guitar hooks focusing heavily on the stability of the rhythm section. In addition, they carry the lead lines and melody of the album while the instrumentation stays in the background, a common approach with the more minimalist perspective that purveys the genre."
4,Good outline for understanding,"Overall a good way to get a clear and concise understanding of each book of the Bible. Many good charts, wish there were more maps."
1,Extremely disappointing!!,"Daphne Bennett wrote the best biography of the Empress Frederick - ""Vicky"" - and everyone should read it, as opposed to Pakula's book which is a pale and anemic and boring imitator. Pakula just can't organize her endless material and make an intimate and involving story out it. She has basically rehashed Bennett's book and added a ton of mother-daughter letters which are eternally cumbersome and difficult and slow down the flow of the book. These letters seemed to be simply dumped here and there and would have been best summarized. Pakula makes history quite an ordeal!"
5,Definitely one of the BEST Hip Hop Albums,"I do not own this particular version of ""King of Rock"". My first exposure was in '84 when my boy had the cassette. We played the hell out of it. I was still new to rap, being from TX. Fast forward to '86 after ""Raising Hell"" came out, I had to own all Run-DMC's joints. CD's were just starting to come out, but hadn't really caught on. Well I was stationed in Japan and they were light years ahead of the US as far as music. So I was able to get all 3 joints on CD in 1987. And I still have them today. Can't read the liner notes because they're in Japanese. This album stays true to it's name....every song goes hard. But then they cap it off with ""Darryl and Joe""....listen to it on a good system and it'll give you goosebumps"
5,Geo/alien/bio-pharm/military/political intrigue galore!,"Deft. Bold. Confident. All descriptions that describe the main character of this series, Inspector Shan Frankland, and the growing ability of its author, Karen Traviss. Between this hard action, brilliantly complex and exquisitely detailed world of a not all that distant future, and Traviss' other new novel of a group of special forces warriors in the Star Wars universe, the bar has been raised for techno-thriller sci fi. I've read other reviews of Traviss that wax poetic about her Ursula K. LeGuinn tendencies and depth of emotional range, but for me, its her amazing sense of realism when dealing with political and military matters that has me already impatient for the next book!Karen Traviss is definitely a new, strong voice in the world of sci fi."
4,Works for me,"So..... yes they are a little spendy, but they are also huge, so you can cut most of them in half and double your quantity.They are pre sealed on one end, which saves time.There is no sales tax, that's good for me.These were shipped for free, that's good for me too.Another plus is that on the rolls of both Food Saver and Magic Vac, toward the end of the roll, the bags get little creases in them and they are impossible to seal. These come in a flat box, and have no creases.Magic Vac bags are a more pliable than the Food Saver bags also.All around a good idea, and a good product."
4,"Good on concepts, weaker on examples","This follow up to About Face is a good overview of the critical concepts to improve software usability. Cooper and Reiman know their stuff. Reading this certainly provides you with the grounding you need to make good decisions. At a tactical level, the book could certainly do more to help with real-world examples.For that, you may want to take a look instead at Jenifer Tidwell's Designing Interfaces : Patterns for Effective Interaction Design. Where About Face is strong on theory, Designing Interfaces is all about practical ideas, demonstrated through graphical examples.If UI is an important part of your world, buy them both."
4,Immediate benefits to my software product,"Out of reading this book, I was inspired to make many changes to my software interface that resulted in dramatic improvements to quality and usability. There are times when I wish it had more out-of-the-box solutions and concrete examples of how to design, and there are times when it devolves to ranting. But there is real help here for me as a software designer."
5,Excellent Book on Interaction Design,"even as a 14 year veteran of interaction design, i learned much more than i would have imagined. well written, well organized, full of great insights."
1,A waste of time and money,"Usability Engineering (UE) is my profession, therefore I was interested in this book. After reading about half of it, I can only say it is a waste of time and money. The author just seems to be in love with his own ideas (which are by no means new- most of his stuff is old wine in a new barrel) but doesn't realy touch the essentials of UE. It is too simple to blame everything on the developpers.For those really interested in UE stay away from this book."
1,Worst than a waste of time,"The tone of the book is very negative, I was often distracted by the authors' strange wording choices, confused by the way their ""rules"" would flip flop, and insulted by their insinuations that *I* am the problem. This book took a tremendous amount of effort to read and definitely was not worth it."
3,No hay color,"Los dos anteriores libros de Cooper son magníficos: por concretos, directos y enfocados. En About Face se habla de problemas de usanza relacionados con pobres prácticas de diseño; y en ""Inmates..."" se establece un método razonable para tratar con ""usuarios no-elásticos"". Ambos son rotundos. Y divertidos. Y prácticos (yo utilizo algunas de sus técnicas en Diseño Contextual y de Interacción). About Face 2.0, sin embargo, sólo añade explicaciones innecesarias al About Face original, pues parece que se quiere formalizar un área que antes se había descrito precisamente como no formalizable, y se desprende un cierto tufillo academicista que no le hace justicia a las ideas de Cooper, expuestas muchas veces en conferencias. Así que, igual que con Meyer, sigo recomendando la primera edición, que con todo quedó algo atrasada (pero sus ideas siguen siendo magníficas para adquirir criterio)."
3,Not for experienced developers,"I have 7 years experience and I wasn't able to get any value out of this book. Based on some of the reviews on this site I thought that the book would be worth buying but unless you are in school or right out of school then your $35 is better spent elsewhere.I suggest that you put your $35 towards ""The Usability Engineering Lifecycle"" by Deborah J. Mayhew. Don't let the $64.95 price tag scare you away. This book is worth $100."
3,Texas is a long way from France,"Before I go any further, allow me to confess that I'm from Texas ... born and raised. This CD of Calvin's is good but not extraordinary. For those who lament the injustice of his greater fame across the pond, I can only say ""come on down to Austin"" where MANY more musicians will blow you away with their talents on any given night. I'm not trying to dis' Calvin's music; it's raw and genuine. But the truth of the matter is, there may be a reason he chose to seek his fame in Europe. As for the claim of Mr Russell being the best of the Texas trubadors, I need only to point to Steve Fromholtz to discount this assertion. The CD is a good sampling of a Texas roadhouse warrior, the kind of act that would fit perfectly at the Starlight in Terlingua. Buy this CD, but don't stop there. This is just the tip of the iceburg for real Texas talent!"
3,list of songs,"""Good Times"" (Sam Cooke) - 3:34""Made for Lovin' You"" (Curly Putman, Sonny Throckmorton) - 2:50""She Flew the Coupe"" (Roger Ferris) - 4:17""Wood"" (Dan Seals) - 4:14""Bordertown"" (Bob McDill, Seals) - 3:57""Water Under the Bridge"" (Bruce Burch, J.P. McMeans) - 3:08""Love on Arrival"" (Seals) - 3:51""A Heart in Search of Love"" (Charlie Black, Rory Michael Bourke) - 3:38""Lonestar"" (Seals, J.D. Souther) - 3:57""Game of Love"" (Paul Brady) - 4:09"
4,format needs work,"Great information. But the format needs work. Author credentials and degrees should be included. Author email also. Very lousy format for graphs, which do have useful information. However, the print and keys are literally fuzzy. Perhaps the paper absorbed too much ink, black and white is not sufficient, and the symbols for different concepts are too much alike. So far I have not found mention of NCLEX or applications in nursing."
4,Excellent for what it is!!,"Well what can one say but classic Sabbath is just that, Classic. It sounds classic in more ways than one. The quality is poor, but remember when this was recorded people. Let's say it's like designing a sports car and then putting the smallest engine you can find into it. You can only remaster something so much and hope it comes out better.The songs themselves are excellent and the packaging is a nice touch as well. Another thing I found rather funny was you can actually make out what Ozzy's saying. I guess he was still coherent back then... It's Sabbath live and because of that you get some add libing here and their. Ozzy's Ozzy, so the ""We love you all"", ""get up"" and a few other Ozzy gems are there. Overall it's a very good cd, not great but good. It you expect classic Sabbath sounds, feel, and vibe, this is it. If you expect clean, digital, sterile sound, this isn't your cd.If you love Sabbath BUY IT!!, if you don't DON'T!!."
2,Very Disappointing,"Surprised to see such positive reviews so far, I'm very disappointed in this set. It's basically just a glorified bootleg, most of the material being recycled from what even the ""casual fanatic"" would already have. Disc 2 comes from only 2 different sources, the 3 Sabotage tracks are from an Aug '75 concert in Asbury Park, NJ and they are the only good thing about this whole set. The rest of disc 2 comes from the heavily-booted (probably a dozen times) Paris 12/20/70 TV broadcast, and clearly not even from a master source. What was the purpose of this set and why the lack of documentation for the material on disc 2? Were they afraid no one would buy it if they knew? If it is supposed to counteract bootlegs it does a poor job since it only provides 3 rare tracks (the full Asbury Park show has apparently started circulating recently) or fails to offer much of a sonic improvment for the other material. Is this really the best they could come up with?"
4,"Good Live Album, But Reunion Is Better","This album was at first a great thing I thought. Finally! A life record from Sabbath! It's a dream come true! The set list is easily one of the best, but I do have one gripe about this album. This sound quality on the latter disc sux on a few of the songs, especially one of my personal favorites, N.I.B. But that was overlooked by the inclusion of the rare Megalomania, one of their best and most underrated songs. If you like Sabbath, you'll like this, if you can get over the slight lack in quality, but Megalomania, War Pigs, Wicked World, and Symptom of the Universe easily make it worth the money."
3,Sound quality,"I'll admit to not having heard this but I don't agree with the notion that poor quality live recordings should be excused just because they were recorded in the early 70's. Just listen to some the Hendrix live stuff (although Woodstock is not great recording wise), Deep Purple live in Japan, the Miles Davis live stuff from early 70's and, of course, the newly released Led Zeppelin live 3CD.If it stinks, it stinks! Black Sabbath, however, rule!Miss UK, 1857"
4,Finally but not at last!,"Live at last was just awful and really I'm amazed by the work they have done to restore that recording!it is now finally a great live with a great sound.Of course here and there you've got some mistakes, but the performance is great too, and a live without overdubs is always better than a fake live-studio album;it's ALIVE!That's for cd 1 because cd2 is not as great.The songs are sublime-check out MEGALOMANIA, HOLE IN THE SKY or HAND OF DOOM, but the sound is just the sound of a good bootleg, especially when you get to the end of the cd:different performance,even lower sound quality.Couldn't they have done the same with cd2 as they did with cd1?I suppose not...anyway if you're a die-hard sabbath fan, this is a must have and if you're just a fan it is still the best live released by sabbath(ok maybe the reunion album, but it doesn't reflect what sabbath was capable of in the 70's).I really enjoy this one!"
3,SOUND QUALITY OFF,"IVE GOT TO GIVE THE PEOPLE THAT PUT THIS OUT AN A FOR EFFORT BUT IF YOUR GOING TO GO THRU THE TROUBLE OF PUTTING THIS OUT,AT LEAST YOU SHOULD CLEAN UP THE SOUND.BLACK SABBATH WAS A GREAT BAND BUT BE WARNED THAT THE SOUND QUALITY OF THIS BLOWS.YOU MIGHT BE BETTER OFF BUYING THERE REMASTED STUDIO CD`S."
5,Better Than Nothing,"I've been waiting for a official live release from the metal masters for a long time. I know Live at Last was released already , but they cleaned it up in Past Lives so now it sounds way better. The second disc in my opinion is just excellent. I never heard songs from Sabotage and that was very cool to hear them on this Live disc. The Jewel case for this release is also very breathtaking...plus if u buy the limited edition u get a poster and a black sabbath guitar pick...but the music is most important. Over all a great purchase from the legends...as of late Ozzy has really been pissing me off though...i mean the tv show and those GOD awful remasters of his solo work....one day Ozzy and his fans will look back on this laugh......"
2,I will not spent my money on it,"Alright, I've got all Sabbath record up until 1981's MOB RULES, more 1987's THE ETERNAL IDOL and 1985's SEVENTH STAR, which I consider Tony Iommi albums, not Sabbath albums.So, I'll ask you: whast's the point of buying LIVE AT LAST again, more a few more live songs in Disc II? Of course disc II sounds fantastic, it has better production. But I already know all the songs by memory, hearing them live will not make my head."
3,"Um, good, but not great.","I had real high hopes for this album but a lot of the music seems to miss the emotional points. It's a bit anticiptic. All technology and no heart... It comes thru at times, but more miss than hit.Try Guillermo Brown's ""Soul at the hands of the machine"" from the same 'blue series' thirsty ear label to get the emotion with the technology... Guillermo's album is truly revolutionary and amazing..."
3,Static swing,"Posturing pianist's solo output here veers between meaningful maneuverings and texture-obsessed tech demos, but along its short way at least a cerebral originality is maintained."
1,Wrong Runts,"The picture displayed is not what was sent. The picture shows the old formula runts, what was shipped is the new formula runts. Two totally diffent flavors.Not bad tasting but I wanted and like the old flavor better."
1,Poor,"The runts that I received did NOT match the picture. The picture is the classic style, but I was sent the new style. Either change the picture or send what is depicted. This was almost a case of false advertising."
1,Gross,I was disappointed when I opened this order to see it was a handful of candy in a ziploc bag. Gross. Is that even legal?
2,"Hangs crookedly, poor quality.","I am not pleased with my purchase. It arrived in a dented box that was packed inside another larger shipping box which was also dented and had holes in it. Given the poor packing job, I was surprised that the individual pieces weren't broken once I unpacked it. That said, one of the orbs had chalky white markings on it, which I had to remove with goo gone. I hired a certified electrician to hang this piece in my dining room, and was very disappointed to see, upon his completion, that the fixture hangs cockeyed! Both my electrician and I realize that this is due to a manufacturing error, not because of his work hanging it. Also, one of the places where a bulb screws in is poorly made; I'm unable to remove the bulb because the entire piece turns along with the bulb as I try to replace it. I'm going to have to replace this piece altogether. Lesson learned: never shop for lighting online - go to a store instead."
3,Not bad but also not what I expected,"My girls own all of Miyazaki's other movies. This one has the art style they expected but has a romantic storyline and a mundane quality that didn't appeal to them. Not terrible or anything, just different."
5,Whisper of the Heart,"'Whisper Of The Heart' follows a school girls experience of first love and how it inspires her to follow her dreams in life. The animation is the usual high quality we've come to expect from any Ghibli film and this film doesn't have that surreal feel to it that 'Howls Moving Castle' or 'Spirited Away' engender. There are many moments where you'll smile or laugh to yourself and the story is sweet and charming. I found the ending a touch abrupt, but that is a minor flaw and doesn't detract from the overall feel or quality of this film. You should finish this film with a nice warm glow inside and also inspired to work harder at fulfilling your life's dreams. I know I did! Another great Ghibli film and well worth a viewing.Feel free to check out my blog which can be found on my profile page."
3,Whisper of the Heart,"I watched this movie a few months ago and it was your basic love story with a few dream-like sequences to flaunt the excellent animation, it held my interest for the most part but the love story itself didn't really engage me, and I think it was because the characters weren't really fleshed out, you just see their rather standard lives, their goals, and that they have feelings, big whoop.HOWEVER, the scene where Seiji starts playing the violin and tells Shizuki to start singing Country Roads was magical, it started out with just her voice and his violin and then the store-owner and his friends come in midway and start playing backing instruments, that was a great scene; I could watch that on repeat. The rest of the movie is enganging enough but didn't leave much of an impression, that one scene though: Wow!"
2,Not what I expected,"As this movie has the Baron in it, I expected a child-friendly adventure. This is more of a romance/soap-opera sort of movie. We watched it once and will probably never do so again. The Cat Returns we watch fairly frequently. I am pretty disappointed."
2,2 stars for the background animation.,"If you are a young girl, you might like this. To most mature-minded young people and adults this is going to seem simplistic, shrill, and pretty boring. I'm not sure which was more annoying, the stilted dialog or the incessant background score. This is a far far cry from ""Spirited Away""."
1,Boring,"This story is plain boring. I guess many people like it because of the beautiful animation but the story is slow, tedious and shallow. It is like a watered down soap opera. Being a fancy movie from a famous animation studio doesn't make it any better."
3,Cute film.,"My wife and I love Miyazaki films (Howl's Moving Castle is our favorite, with Castle in the Sky in 2nd). This was really cutesy and a good story. Good movie, enjoyable, just not quite the same as aforementioned movies."
4,"Great Quality, Great Movie!",My wife and I have long been fans of Ghibli filmmaking and this film is no exception. The DVD arrived as expected and worked without a hitch. The seller has done well and sold product as promised.
5,"excellent...a beautiful, heart-felt story","as a miyazaki fan, i knew i had to buy this movie...but i had no idea i would fall in love with it! it is by far my favorite miyazaki film to date. the innocent first love story is genuine and adorable, and helps us to remember what it was like to have a crush for the first time. this movie is great for children, teens, and adults, and is a light-hearted, feel-good movie. i definitely recommend this one!"
5,Love At This Age,When you think about kids in love you know it's just puppy love but Whisper Of The Heart seems to be full-grown. Even in middle school these kids get great grades and still are able to maintain lives of love. The story is simple girl hates guy but eventually they fall in love with each other except this is a pure love story that isn't tainted by raunchiness or anything too old that would feel uncomfortable. It's truly the way true love stories are created and that's at an early age when it is considered as friendship first. Originally made in 95 but the animation is perfect for this type of movie and the voice actors hit the target. Whisper Of The Heart makes you wish you had the same whisper when you were this age and shows you what it could've been like if you did.
5,My favorite Ghibli film,"Yes, Totoro is more ""cute"" and Sen to Chihiro (Spirited Away) is more epic, but this more introspective and down-to-earth installment in the Ghibli canon is my favorite. I love the characters, the music and of course, the animation. Not a huge fan of the dub track, altho they did the best they could, so watch it in Japanese with English subtitles."
3,Not What People Are Saying,"First thing you all need to know: I am a 16 year old guy.That's right, not a ""Tween"" girl, and I loved this movie. (Borrowing my family account, so that's why it says Christine, btw)True, it doesn't have any of the action or adventure that made Mononoke or Nausicaa great, but it does have something that (in my mind) makes up for it. Real charecters. This is a movie about real people doing real things. Any number of teenagers could have lived this movie, there's no magic or fantasy, but there's also none of the bull that makes most modern romances so bad.Watch this if you are mature enough to appreciate real charecters doing real things against a backdrop of really beautiful art. It's all about the directors ability to create actual people out of paper and ink, which I think he does spectacularly.(I only rated this three stars because I know it's not what most people expect from Ghibli)"
5,an anime for all ages,"Whisper of the heart is a wonderful, gentle movie in which Miyazaki's love for children will warm the hearts of old and young alike.The main character of the story is Shizuku, a girl at the threshold of her teenage years. In the movie she discover her strengths and weaknesses with the help of the Baron,(a statue of a cat), an old man who runs an curiosity store, (when he feels like it) and Seiji, a boy who has been in love with her for a long time and finally succeeds to make her notice him.Seiji had dreams of becoming a violin maker and Shizuku wants to be a writer. Both of them find out that it takes schooling and hard work to reach their dreams.Miyazaki has a wonderful way of portraying children, gentle and still very natural and realistic. When watching this movie I felt I got a glimps of life in Japan and wonder if this is a life of the past or if one still lives that way.This movie will be enjoyed by kids of any school age and by anyone who loves children."
5,It holds everything.,"This bag is more then i expected. It has more room in the lower section then i or anyone could use. I put a pair of ice skates, and a pair of roller skates. And had room left over to put other items. Built strong to last."
4,Don't let the cover fool you....,"Don't let that cover fool you; it is over the top and if you ask me, is a detraction from the film itself. The movie is creepy, suspenseful as well as a bit of a history lesson regarding the massive earthquake that hit Kobe in 1995. I didn't write this to get into specifics of the film's plot since I think the previous reviewer did a fine job, only to say that the cover does not accurately portray how well done the film actually is. They need to re-issue it with a better cover to do it justice!"
2,Produced and directed by Jean Jaques Rousseau and Karl Marx,"The problem with the script is that it could have been written by Rousseau or Karl Marx. The producers seem to believe that human beings were peaceful hunter gatherers who shared all their food until someone set aside land for agriculture and claimed the land as their own property. So, the wandering people had no choice but to kill the farmers and steal their food. The pruducers do admit that settled people could use their spare time to make things out of clay, stone, and metal but that only led to the creation of a class system. As for cities - they are only breeding ground for diseases.There you have it - private property is the origin of war and inequality. Don't waste your money on this Marxist claptrap."
5,Unique portrait of evolution of social organisation and mindset,"This item contains an interestingly presented history of the evolution of mindset of humanity from the first men to the first civilizations. Didatic, simple, informative and pleasurous watching. A whow DVD, despite its short duration. It can be used in schools for informative and easy language."
4,this was great,I think this is a great teaching tool. I teach World History in Florida and my students really loved this DVD I highly reccomend it.
3,Kind of hilarious,"I'm sure that much of the information was good, and the style of presenting the various steps to civilization through fictionalized stories was probably a good one. However, it just made me want to laugh. The story of Ookey (I have no idea what the spelling is supposed to be, but this is the one I'm going with), the unlucky-in-love-but-lucky-in-irrigation, is one of many romance-melodramas. Or Sarkey, the apparently cold scribe who turns out to have a heart of gold. Or Tobar, the country hick with dreams of city life. I just couldn't take it seriously."
2,Watch the Special Features Program.,"The ""Quest for Fire"" redux of the main documentary wasn't that appealing to me. However, in the special features section, they include a 50-minute work on skeletons that they refer to as ""hobbits."" They peel the onion showing that these skeletons were not humans facing dwarfism or pygmies. There was a relative of humans that lived for at least 80,000 years, but then disappeared approximately 18,000 years ago. They include silly footage of modern people saying the hobbits still live in a nearby mountain. Also, the skeleton looks like it's mouth was punched in, but the narrator later says, ""We have no evidence of trauma to the skeleton."" Still, I enjoyed it more than the main work, so I encourage others not to overlook it."
1,Oversimplistic and naive,"This so-called documentary presents an overly speculative view that shows humans progressing toward civilization, starting with an absurd scenario of a peaceful nomadic group encountering a selfish group of settled hunter-gatherers. This show belongs more to the category of pseudo-docu-drama than it does to anything educational. I do not recommend that anyone waste their money buying this."
5,Sammy and some of his real friends give Geffen a send off!,"Don't be misguided by others into thinking this is a Van Halen album with Sammy's name on it. Yes,it is true that Sammy had to fulfill contract obligations to Geffen and make what was thought to be his last solo album.But this album is all Sammy as he plays all the guitar and relegates Eddie to some weak bass playing that Bill Church should have handled.Mikey and Al were left at home as Sammy's former and current keyboardist Jesse Harms as well as former and current drummer David Lauser fulfill their rightful roles in the band.As far as the music, it was all recorded without the use of seperate track recordings; in other words it was played and sung together as if being recorded live and is Sammy's personal favorite solo album. Featuring ""Eagles Fly"" and ""Give to Live"", this album is a winner from start to finish with Sammy getting a rare VH days chance to play the lead. Enjoy!"
5,I Never Said Goodbye Review,Sammy's Best Work Ever. I have loved this album for over a decade and recommend it to everyone who has multiple emotions and loves music.
3,The man can rock!!!,Sammy knows rock and how to entertain...he fulfills his solo contract with an album that pulls in some Halen but still showcases the Red Rocker.
3,I Never Said Goodbye,"Good album, but most of the songs I wanted were also on ""The Essential Red,"" which I also purchased."
1,You may be sorely disappointed!,"If you are expected a sequel to Repo Man you will be sorely disappointed.This move is an odd work of art and I don't mean that in a good way.It was mostly shot in front of green screens with the backgrounds added after. The characters are weird and almost cartoonish and nothing is taken very seriously in this art movie, quiet the opposite of Repo Man. After you watch the movie you may grasp some concept of what the background setting is, as a character did at the end, but you are really only left confused and wondering why.A few of the actors in Repo Man appear in the movie, but all that does is give it something in common with Plan 9 From Outer Space. Although it was comforting to hear Olivia Barash's (Leila) raspy voice in a cameo towards the end.So unless your are some weird fan of Alex Cox creations, I would not buy this thing. There's a reason it never made it into the theaters."
4,A Change of Pace,"Lights in the Dark is not business as usual for Hector Zazou. For those familiar with his recent pop-oriented theme/concept albums, this release is VERY different. This is a collection of Gaelic Hymns. While his previous albums have been almost global in their scope and appeals to pop music, which were there strong points, this album is almost academic in it's adherence to the mood of the work. That having been said, this album is VERY relaxing and almost etherial. HZ's got real talent and his artists here (For when does he EVER work alone) are more than up to the task of making these songs authentic, accessable and worthwile."
2,"If you are not a beginner in reloading, it's not worth reading.","If you have been shooting and reloading for awhile there is nothing in this book you don't already know. However, if you are just getting into reloading it may help you."
1,How I wish I had known,"I wish I had known that this was just re-packaging of two titles I already have. I wish that Brian May and Roger Taylor would sit down with a really skilled journalist and talk honestly about Queen. There are so many myths about them, yet I can understand why they protect themselves and their families. I love their music and I think it has survived the test of time very well. I guess that has to be enough for now......"
2,Queen,"I thought the Queen interviews and performances were great. I got alot of background information that I didn't know before,making my appreciation of the performances greater.One DVD however, didn't play at all. The title screen said it can;t play.I guess it gets a 50 overall. One disc is great...one disc won't play."
2,Beware! The neclace did not look anything like the photo.,"I received the necklace in a timely fashion and it was not expensive, but the necklace I received did not look anything like the photo of the necklace I thought I was buying. It was green and white stones not brown tiger eye stone. I don't have the time to spend sending it back, so sadly I will never order anything from Amazon again since it was quite disappointing to receive something I did not really order."
4,Mickey scores,"Rather dark, a little slow to develop, but worth watching. And you thought Mickey's face was made-up for 'The Wrestler'."
3,Pretty Good!!!,"My dad received this as a Father's Day present. It started off kinda boring, but gradually got a little better. A hit man named Armand ""The Blackbird"" Degas is after Carmen and Wayne Colson who saw his face, so he must kill them. He takes Richie Nix under his wing. Carmen and Wayne are placed in a Witness Protection Program, but that doesn't do any good. Will the Colson's make it out alive? I'd recommend KILLSHOT!!!"
1,KiLLSHOT,"The DVD was no good, 45 minutes into the movie was unable to view anymore as disc damaged, was very disappointed. was a good movie until then, although a little slow and Mickey Rourke like watching paint dry."
3,Wasnt awesome but I enjoyed,"I have certainly seen better movies with these actors in them. However, I did enjoy the movie and thought that Mickey Rourke and Diane Lane was certainly worth watchinh."
3,An interesting movie.,"The production value of this movie seemed rushed to me. Like they were on a tight budget, and they couldn't afford multiple takes on some scenes.The acting was underwhelming in some parts and overwhelming in others. It was pretty inconsistent.The storyline was alright. Mickey Rourke did a good job in his role, aside from looking like his face was falling off of his face.Worth renting, not buying."
3,worth it,"As a plot the movie deserves 2 stars. as for the actors, 3 stars, making the movie worth watching once."
3,A real barn burner,"I watched this movie one night out of pure boredom. I cannot say there was anything memorable about it, but if you like semi-action movies this might be worth your time. If anything Diane Lane and Mickey Rourke needed some extra money and this movie was an acceptable screenplay."
4,Better than I expected,This movie was a pleasant surprise. It kept my interest. It was a little bit gruesome with some unexpected events. Good action flick. Joseph Gordon-Levitt was terrific and Mickey Rourke was intiminating as a hitman.
2,Not Exciting,"Some books just don't work as movies and this may be one of them. This movie just was not excting. All the actors did a fine job, though Lane did not have her usual sex appeal. Even Rourke's superb performance could not salvage this one."
2,No good...,"Being a fan of Diane Lane, usually I watch her films. This one promised to be a generallly entertaining thriller, the more so if you add the presence of ((each day uglier) Mickey Rourke and Thomas Jane, an actor I think deserved better fortunes (by that I mean better roles) in the movie business.But guess what? I was wrong. This is not a good movie. It's technically efficient, I guess. But it's so full of plot holes, lack of interesting characters, lazy acting... well, the list goes on and on. The actor who plays Rourke's side kick gives such an over the top performance that seldom I've seen such annoying performance.Anyway, since the movie is relatively short (95 minutes), you probably have a chance of not getting too mad after watching it..."
1,If you like this movie then ...,"This killing story was over-the-top, unless you work for a Mexican drug cartel, having said that there is an audience that is susceptible to being entertained by this cheapest of mayhem. I wonder if the actors and studio personnel are capable of going beyond their monetary self-interest and consider the contributory consequences of their ""creative endeavors""."
5,This is the perfect size for small jobs around the house.,"I like the yellow sheath, it makes it stand out, also it's easy to see your repair verses the work others have done.The quality is very good, having the ULV approval is what you always want so you know the wire is rated for your repair."
4,ROSEMARYS BABY,"ROSEMARYS BABY, CLASSIC HORROR MOVIE.BELONGS IN EVERY COLLECTION,I WOULD RECOMMEND MOVIE TO EVERYONE. PLOT AND CONSTANT FEELING OFSUSPENSE THROUGHOUT MOVIE!"
5,Happy with purchase,"Excellent picture quality crisp and clear would recommend to anyone. Better than original movie seen in theatres. Very, very satisfied."
4,Missing 1 thing...,"Good stuff from Criterion as usual, but it would have been perfect with a commentary track added as an extra feature."
2,What's so great about this movie?,"I was excited when I sat down to watch this, it sounded just like my sort of movie. But, I'll be damned if I found anything remarkable about it. Maybe it was an important film, maybe it ushered in some brand new methods of suspense which now everyone copies, but the me who watched it for the first time had a McKayla Malroney grimace."
1,ROMAN POLANSKI CHILD MOLESTER.,"I would not spend a dime on anything that Roman Polanski the child molester is involved with. Does anyone remember that he drugged a teenager and raped her many years ago and then fled the country like the coward he is. If you have any children you should feel the same. These monsters masquerading as ""artists"" should never be forgiven. Of course he roams around freely in Europe with the other trash in the film industry. Strangely enough the victim has forgiven him but a message must be sent that hideous acts like the one Polanski bestowed upon his victim must never be forgiven. He is scum of the lowest nature, a devil in an intellectual abyss of misguided power that believes he is better than any woman could ever be."
4,Great CD,"This CD, although different from anything else I have heard from Armand, is absoulutley wonderfull. Anybody who can tell me that they have heard something like this before is crazy. This shows the creativity used while having fun making an album. Keep up the good work Armand, We love you"
2,2 Future 4 You was a FLUKE.,"I've purchased both of Van Helden's realeases since 2 Future and they were cut from different cloth (really [bad] cloth at that!). This album has tons of tracks, most of which are stupid ""interludes"" of Armand joking with his buddies. The joke was on me apparantly - for purchasing this aweful record. The 4-5 actual songs are filled with him rapping, which CLEARLY demonstrates he should stick to spinning the tunes ONLY. I hated ""Killing Puritans"" but thought Armand deserved a second chance with this album. Guess he's got 2 strikes now."
3,Khan Artist,"I've never heard about Armand but apparently he's really popular.As a musician I found it hard to appreciate this cd at first, because all I was hearing was needlessly repetitive loops of the same beats that lasted too long.After 4 tries I finally found a few songs that I could respect and enjoy. My favorites are Doovoodoo, Kentuckey Fried Flow, Ghandi Khan, and Heed the White Seed.This CD is unique from anything i've ever been exposed to and it is strange to say the least. My summery of this cd: ""Islamic Hard House mixed with Disco""Requires an open/twisted mind and an appreciation for rap and disco. Otherwise your head might explode. Enjoy!"
1,It is not the same without Anthony Edwards,"It is not the same without Anthony Edwards so I won't be buying it, Seasons 1-8 is complete to me"
3,Good but not as good as the previous ER's,"I am a big ER fan, but I find at the end of the series most of the characters that we have come to know and love have faded out of the picture. Dr. Carter is one of my favorite characters but he seems to not be in these episodes as much as the previous ones. I seriously miss Nurse Hathaway and Dr. Green."
2,No one can answer for God,This book could have been written without critiicising the faithbased ministry. Dobson's use of this made the book less helpful for me.
4,Book purchase,I was happy to find this book in such good condition as it is not being published in hardbook anymore. It arrived quickly and in the condition it was advertised to be. I could not find it in my area but found several copies available at Amazon.
2,Not written for the thinker,"This book basically tells you that 1. God understands 2. Other people have been through worse and still maintained their faith 3. You can too by following their example.It's basically a collection of testimonies to help you see that you can get through _________.If your questions are on an intellectual or rational level as are mine, stay away from this book."
4,A Good Encouragement When Life Doesn't Make Sense,"Whether going through the loss of a job, loved one, divorce, or any other difficult situation, Dobson encourages the reader to keep trusting in God and His goodness when trials come.The book's chapters are as follows:1. When God Doesn't Make Sense2. The Betrayal Barrier3. God Makes Sense Even When He Doesn't Make Sense4. Acceptance or Despair5. He Will Deliver Us, but If Not6. Questions and Answers7. The Adversity Principle8. Faith Must Be Tough9. The Wages of Sin10. More Questions and Answers11. Beyond the Betrayal BarrierWhile Dobson does mention that some of our hardships result from our bad choices, he is also quick to add that some of life's trials happen to us because that's just the way life is!A great encouragement to anyone who is going through difficult struggles and also to help prepare someone before they do go through struggles.Recommended."
4,comforting in hard times,I got this book when my brother passed away and it really helped me put things in prespective as to why things happen and especally see it is not anyone's fault. Now I bought it for a friend that lost her long time boyfriend.
4,A Book That Makes Sense,"When life seems to hand us a raw deal, we begin to blame God or even question his existence or his love for us. ""When God Doesn't Make Sense"" deals with the tough issues. Dr. Dobson tells us it's okay to question God's purpose in allowing bad things that happen to good people. We need never question his love. But as the author says, we can either despair or trust in God's sovereignty. I discovered this book several years ago and bought it for myself. Some time later when my brother was facing serious health issues (which eventually took his life), I bought the book for him to bring him comfort. I most recently ordered another one to be sent to a nephew in a different state who is battling melanoma. This is a book you will want to share with anyone who is hurting - physically or spiritually. God bless."
5,tray dee is hitting,tray dee and goldie loc left snoop's label but thney seem to be on good terms cause snoop raps on here and yeah as expected from a west coast cd the p-funk-zapp flavor is all over it recognize the real. A shame nobody feels this kind of rap amymore but everybody from the east and dirty south wanna copy this stuff.
2,General's dookie list,"I dont even know why I bothered to pick this up. I know Tray Deee is an underrated west coast rapper but compilations are usually bad and this one is not excempt. The only worthwhile tracks on here is Tray Deee's solo joint Izuwitit, Snoops solo Fine and Bad Azz's Hard Times On Planet Earth. The rest of this comp stinks to high heaven. Thugzzz PrayII is awful lyrically and beatwise and is precisely the reason why people sleep on The Outlawz. I Can Make You Dance is rubbish just like the rest of this album. Bottom Line: Big Tray Deee's General's List is the worst compilation next to Thugs R Us, Violator and Ruff Ryders. The no namesters were at their worst, the beats are horrific and basement sounding and three good songs are a good reason to skip this one. If you want Tray Deee at his best, pick up both of Tha Eastsidaz albums and stay away from this tragedy of a compilation."
2,"Wrong size, too dark","Keen make a great product, but in ordering them on line, I'm never sure which size to order. I normally wear a size 8 and for the Alamosa's I ordered, this was fine. The Targee's however were too small in an 8, as were the Syskyu's. I finally ordered a pair os Syskyu's in 8.5 and so far seem to do OK; but I haven't had them very long.The Targee's I ordered were also a lot darker in color than pictured."
3,Chico,"I have purchased Keen before and they fit, this shoe doesn't fit, it is loose. Would not recommend it to a friend."
2,no repeats,"i too thought the kleen Targhee hiking boots were built to last based on their looks and feel but soon found out otherwise. i couldnt belive just how fast the bottom tread disappeared .soon after came the inner linings, tearing at the seems on both shoes about the same time . i wore them everyday for approx. six months. i almost bought another pair but reminded myself just how short there life span was . I cant make that same mistake twice otherwise that would be shame on me."
2,I would not buy them again,"It's been exactly one year since I bought them. As some reviewers pointed out, they were comfortable out of the box. I used them almost every day except summer time in Chicago. The thread is half of the original now. They did not have waterproofing from the beginning.Before this pair I had New Balance walking shoes that served me almost 5 years. There is no way I'll buy Keen's junk again."
5,Most comfortable shoes,These are my second pair and it only took 3 days to break them in. The shoes are the most comfortable shoes I have ever owned.
2,My least favorite Keen,"This was my second pair of Targhee II's, and this pair fell apart quicker than the first pair. They felt great for about the first month, before the sole started to wear quickly, as well as the shoe losing it's cushioning properties..."
5,Water Proof Keen Targhee II Low Top Hiking Shoe,"*No break in time required.*Water Proof.*Easy to tie (last lace clip locks lace in place to assist in tying).*Nice Looking.*Comfortable all day hiker for the woods or the streets.*Liked the first pair so much I bought another and recommend them to family, friends and you!"
5,Targhee II,Love these shoes. Am currently on my 3rd pair of these and will continue to buy them. I have a very wide front part of my foot and need a wide toe box---these shoes give me what I need. Only complaint is that the outsole wears faster than I think it should. That being said maybe I just wear the heck out of em and that would explain the problem.
1,a dud,Clunky and stiff - I found them to be most uncomfortable. They seemedto have a shape different from my feet.
3,Nice Shoe,"I liked the looks and construction of the shoe but it wouldn't stay on my heel, not sure why. Anyway I returned for a refund."
2,Colors are a miss match,"The shoes are comfortable out of the box. However, the colors don't match the images on line. I got the ""Dark Earth/ Madder Brown"" (a soft reddish brown) and that is what it says on the box but it looks more like a mix of all the other shoes. I like the shoes but I am not sure what I will get if I return them. Function is more important than looks. Anybody else have this problem?"
3,A little known brand.,"The shoes are not ugly but lack of originality, ie shoes seem like any other, nothing impressive. They are very comfortable."
1,uncomfortable,"Don't make the same mistake I did and buy these shoes.Based upon good reviews and reputation of the brand, I bought them and they are painful shoes to wear.Heavy and the top of the shoe bend in onto the top of your foot."
5,Comfortable and flexible!,This is a great hiking shoe -- comfortable and flexible right out of the box. I hike with these shoes almost every day and they seem to be holding up very well. Great product!
5,"I ordered on line, couldn't find it in my store","this is my favorite sweet and sour sauce. I make homemade won-tons, and this is the only sauce that compliments my cooking."
1,Malísimo,Es uno de los mayores adefesios de la música. No se entiende como una empresa de discos seria puede prensar esta porqueria
4,View of a fourth year medical student,"I found this book to be a great review of all the neuro I had forgotten since first year. It is clinically oriented and it includes a good run down on the neurological exam. Other books tend to cover just the exam and little else or they cover too much esoteric information. This is a good blend of both. It's also about 5.5 x 8.5 inches so it will fit in a lab coat pocket, something only a med student would care about. Overall a good resource for a clerkship."
3,Arrived in a timely fashion and as advertised. Nothing more to say than that. (5 more words for the word...),Arrived in a timely fashion and as advertised. Nothing more to say than that. (5 more words for the word...)
3,Bad for shelf good for clinical application,"This book did a great job in giving good up-to-date clinical information and prepared me quite well for the clinical portion for our neurology clerkship. However, when it comes for shelf preparation, this book was lacking. I think it delved too deeply into pathophysiology and obscure genetics and not enough on the actual type of questions covered on the shelf. If using for a self, I would recommend a different book (e.g. Case Files, etc.)."
1,worst chem book ever,"This is the most horrible chemistry book, I have ever seen. There are so many mistakes, there are not enough examples with clear explanations, and it looks as if the authors spent about 10 minutes trying to organize this. I have used other chemistry books, and not to say that they are perfect, but this book really is horrible. Try and spend a couple dollars doing research on how to organize. When you introduce a topic in chapter 4, do not say it will be explained in chapter 11. Explain all topics the first time you mention them!"
4,Perfect divers companion,Lots of great info in these books. Every diver who dives in the Caribbean should have a set. Makes it easy and fun to identify all the critters we photographed after a dive vacation.
5,Great,"This book is awesome, pictures are great as well as all the information in it. This is a must have for any diver!"
2,NOT FOR MARINE AQUARIUM HOBBYIST,"As a marine aquarium hobbyist I was disappointed with this set of books. It doesn't tell you much on the behaviour and characteristic of the fishes, invertebrates and corals. The most disappointed and surprised was the book on reef fish, such a thick book but only a few species were introduce."
3,Don't count this out,"Despite scathing reviews, this is not a bad movie. Thornton's Crockett is an interesting take on the man. The action is acceptable except for the final defeat of Santa Anna, which was poorly done. Worth a slow evening."
2,YAWN,"There's a moment in this sparkless film where General Dennis Quaid sports scary muttonchops and a cravat and looks like he knows he's an Iconic Figure at a Historic Moment. Insert your own colorful Texas aphorism here as the film is really, really frantic to get you riled up at this point. Because it knows, I guess, that it's totally failed to get you riled up before that, and now it's two hours into the film, and if it doesn't get your pulse going now, it's never gonna happen. Thirty excruciating minutes later you discover that it still hasn't."
4,Watch it,The Alamo is a good movie. Some things that really happened at the Alamo happedned in the movie like the Travis guy got shot in the head in the begining of the last fight for the Alamo. The begining of the movie is very boring. And the battle is at the very very end of the movie and after that theres the battle where Sam Huston defeats Santa Annas army in 18 minutes after the Alamo. If you like the Alamo you should definately watch this movie.
1,"Didn't anyone ever say, ""Hey, this screenplay sucks!""","What an awful depiction of such a historical event.Sure, the history (as told in the movie) is more acurate than John Wayne's classic - BUT - and this is important - there was absolutely no soul or feeling in this movie. The characters are thrown up on the movie screen - with very little backstory - and are not the least bit developed.The screenplay jumps around and by the middle of the movie you are begging for Mexican soldiers to beat the living hell out of the Texans...and I'M A TEXAN. The actual seige took less time than this movie - I prayed for it to be over!The casting was also horrible and the acting did not live up to the actors own respective previous works. What a shame for all involved.All in all, this movie was a huge disappointment. There was 0 return on my investment. That is $20 and two and a half hours I will never get back!"
4,Great for Texas History,Watched this with my son as extra credit for his Texas History class. I found it informative & enjoyable. Learned some things that I had forgotten from when I took Texas history many years ago. Good performances from all the leads.
3,breezy,"good cast, but tries to cover too much history. never really get's to the characters interactions with each other. could have spent more time at the Alamo, and focused less on outside details. not a bad watch, but would like to have spent more time focusing on site."
5,Santa Anna is a wonderful villain,"Emilio Echevarria is really super as Santa Anna - he shoots innocent peasants, snarls at his own generals, throws away the lives of his own soldiers (""chickens""), sips fine wine, and enjoys the company of young senoritas. REMEMBER FOLKS THIS IS HOLLYWOOD, NOT HISTORY."
3,Inacurate but Informative,"This movie was very inacurate, but you could learn a few things. They could havecut all the Jim Bowie romance scenes. Dennis Quaid really tried, I just can't see himplaying in anything, but a sports movie. Very well made, Please comment if this has helped you."
1,Turned it off about halfway through,I believer this was made by the same group that made the terrible Pearl Harbour. This is only slightly better but not by much. It is a very hollywood version of the Alamo. The dialogue is cheesy as is the direction. I was looking forward to a realistic telling of the story but what we get here is worthy of a made for TV offering but not a major movie
1,worst movie ive ever seen !!!,"awful!!! ireally like historical movies but this was an exception.waste of money,talent,producer should have never greenlighted it!"
1,"SORRY,TOO MUCH HOLLYWOOD","I wish the makers of this film had tried to depict the Alamo as it was fought,and forgotten about artistic effect.The Mexicans never attacked at night.If they had they would have lost more men to friendly fire than they actually did.And about those rockets,give me a break.Mitch"
2,Amazingly Bad,"Beautiful landscapes, sunsets, cinematography. Excellent actors, costumes, props, sets. Dynamic and compelling story. Dull, boring movie, broken up by dreadful blunders. Seeing the characters in their fated historical place, and not caring. Go watch ""Apollo 13"" if you want to see history brought to incredible fiction-life."
5,a fine film,Since seeing The Alamo I've been reading everything I can find about it and the events that happened before and after it. I want to know all sides of the story and the motivations of all the major and minor players. I want to find out all I can about the people involved in that historic period and this film is what ignited my deep interest. I'm not a history student or buff by nature but this film really put a human face on the events surrounding the Alamo. This is a beautiful and moving film.
2,An Uninspiring Garbage Of A Movie,"I was watching this in high hopes of watching a truly inspiring movie based on a truly inspiring event and this movie just sucked. The script was plain boring and the battles were dry and without soul.I'm glad some of you loved the movie so much, whatever you were taking at the time should be prescribed along with the movie. I just found this movie extremely weak. The Alamo was great, this movie is not.Would not watch this version again. Sorry if I can't further describe why this movie is so lame because I might just tell you the whole plot of the movie while I'm at it. Since there's so many people that like this movie, I guess most likely you'll like it too. I am truly disappointed because I waited so long and expected so much from this. Screw the movie, I'm going back to the book."
2,"Slow,dull&very,very borring","A good western is hard to come by,and not many do.Unless you are an unwaivering,fanatical,die hard, history buff,this version of The Alamo plods along so slowly its aggrivating.I like a good western now and then,and I think instead of trying to make an epic out of this movie,it could have been tightened up a bit&picked up the pace.It is probably more historically acurate than other versions made,but at a price of puting you into a deep coma.There were small bursts of action,but not much more than that.This is'nt a western for everyone,and only the folks who really want the low,down on the Alamo will enjoy it."
2,not,Not recommended. 10 minutes was more than enought for this movie. Thanks to fast forward. Boring. Couldn't get into it.
4,GREAT film for non-history buffs,Rented this one and some other movies and watched them with friends and pizza. We aren't history buffs but it had Billy Bob Thorton so we figured it had to be at least worth a look and pleasantly we discovered that John Lee Hancock's The Alamo is a GREAT film that entertained us all. 8 thumbs up!
3,A slow-paced decent film,When I first saw this film i couldn't decide if I liked it or not. It was a good film and all but it did not have a battle until around 2 hours into the film. I know that the alamo was those long days the film showed but couldn't they make it a little bit less longer? The acting itself was good and dioluge was fine and the battle was well done but there still was something missing. And it was that the alamo didn't portraye 'ol davy crocket the way I had hoped.This film is PG-13 and I will tell what for on the scale below.Sensuality 2there is a brief kiss.violence 6many people get shot in a battle men are knocked over [and out] with a cannon ball shot Ect.profinaty 3there is some strong languge in this film although mostly at the begining.Overall: A slow-paced decent movie
4,very good!,"My entire family enjoyed watching this movie.Excellent casting all around, good writing, music, photography...it's a winner.All of the characters come to life as do many historical elements that I never knew.I give it an A."
4,Not bad,"Not bad for an Alamo movie, which are generally the biggest bunch of fantasy around. At least this one showed the attempted surrender of the Alamo defenders---which really did happen and which John Wayne seemed to overlook. But even this one did not show the latest evidence of the battle as found in the book ""Exodus from the Alamo"" where it was disclosed that many fled through the back door when the battle started. Hopefully that will be brought out in the future by a more realistic Alamo movie."
1,Thr Alamo Has Got To GO,"ok, so first i'd like to say that I entered the theaters excited and very much looking forward to a great film. I'm sorry to say that I was very disappointed. Apart from the terrible acting, the whole film was just like an ongoing conversation, without anything interesting happening. Now I've been a Davy Crockett hater all my life, but this film only deepend that hate. Billy Bob Thorton really does need to go die somewhere. He was probably the main reason the movie was such a disappointment. If you are looking for a movie worth paying for, you should really try something like ""The Punisher,"" don't waste time on this load of ****."
3,"These are for car audio systems, Amazon mislabelled these","Thank you amazon for marking these as regular wireless headphones. They do not come with any cables or a base unit to connect it to an audio system. The packaging gives no clue that these are not regular wireless headphones, either. Only when you dig around and find the manual do you find out that these are for automotive entertainment units. This is an additional headphone for an OEM automotive unit. Don't order these thinking you can use them at home, they won't work."
5,clear sounding radio,"Clear sound and very compact communication system.Well priced ,it does not have inputs for radios or mp3 players , but if all you need is a bike to bike talk system, I would recomend this system ."
3,need a way to hold the plug into the radio,"The small plug on the radio continuously disconnects, had to use duct tape to keep it connected."
3,slick concert - slack videos,Hii was impressed with the scooter as a matter of fact very good dance music but the it lacks the enegy in the 'videos' on dvd 2 however the concert was fantasic with plenty of raw energy unleashed !!!! - really nice full of energy and crowd participation was at its peak!!I had expectations with videos on dvd 2 but the videos were not impressive to say the least - the raw energy was imperceptible in them but overall this dvd set is good !!! hence 3 starsthankx if this review helps
2,no fit,this heater works fine but will not fit into the BiOrb with the suction cups inclosed. You just have to let it dangle in the tank by the cord and hope it does not go into the water.
5,Artistic!!,"This book continued the dragon star series with a strong flourish. These characters never stop amazing me. I don't care who you are but you will connect in one way or another with one of these characters.If you have had the pleasure of reading any of the books by Martin, J.V. Jones, Douglas, and Tolkien you will find yourself at home reading this series."
5,Can we please get the last 3 Sunrunner books Kindled?,"It is a 6 book set, yet only the first 3 are available for Kindle. My poor old paperback copies are nearly falling apart from the re-reads."
3,This second book in a war that threatens all.,The war continues and friends and enemies are won and lost. The seemingly endless struggle continues against the High Warlord. Old wounds are opened along with old desires with an ending that will keep readers waiting for the third and final book.
5,RUN DMC Still Doing their thang,"Have never purchased a used disc - i was quite pelased with the outter cd case itself especially since it is not full plastic but that cardboard (lp like ) wrapped around the disc container. There was only a small wear (super minimal ) where the cover flips open -upon looking at the disc - no scratches at all and the liner notes look Brand new.Ok on to the Music -This just takes me back to day - to some of the most creative of that time - they really set the pace for what was to come from other artist with there mixing , out of sync off beat ""beats""what a easier time that was . Peace"
3,HEBREW ARAMAIC DICTIONARY,Only the characters are printed with the english defination. It would be helpful to have the characters name
3,i love spanish cinema,"this was better than expected - honestly, i bought it for gael garcia bernal and because i love any latin american themed movies so i had no expectation of the film"
1,The Wonder Years,"Remember that TV show, ""The Wonder Years""? Well, this is the Cuban version and Winnie is now Carmen. The only possible explanation for Harvey Keitel's presence is the kid who stars in it is Keitel's grandson or Keitel's daughter made him do it because her husband wrote or produced it."
5,Not Your Father's Mystery Novel,"I originally got this book because I've had the pleasure of interacting with the author online and have always appreciated his creativity, wit and writing style in that forum. To read over 400 pages of his fiction was an extension of that pleasure. I don't usually read mystery novels because I get tired of the same old gumshoe approach to storytelling. Knowing Will's sense of humor and unique take on life in general, it didn't surprise me to discover that there's not one piece of gum on this mystery's shoes. Denton and Monty are unique characters that I found refreshingly different from the run-of-the-mill sleuths ~ they remind me of a punk rock/pyschic version of a cross between The Thin Man and The Bickersons. I enjoyed barreling through each chapter as I followed a case that took me out of this world and back to again. I highly recommend ""Resurrection Angel"" to anyone who likes a good new-fashioned page-turner with heart."
3,makes a good screen saver but as entertainment it is boring!!!,"The product was delivered as promised by the vendor. However, the product itself makes a good screen saver but it is not entertainment. It is boring and if you do not have a 3D tv, you'll be wasting your money as 3D is the only good thing about this movie. You watch the same marine life over and over and over until you hit the stop button or fall asleep."
1,"The music is terrible, too!!!!!","After 10 minutes of watching this screen saver (this is not a movie, neither a documentary), I had to put it in mute, the music is very annoying. Really disappointed."
3,Interesting to an extent. Kind-of boring.,"3-D is pretty good. Movie (DVD) is s-l-o-w. Not great. Only bought because it was cheap(er than usual), but seller (shipper) was FAST, great. Thanks. Happy Holiday!"
1,boring movie,this movie in not good and is boring I don't recommend this movie no for the they want to watch the real creature
5,Deep Lyrics--Fabulous Voice!,"When I listened to this album, I found myself getting right into the lyrics (no meaningless syrup here!) and going ""Wow!"" at how Kirstin's voice bent and changed as it wrapped itself around the melodies in the various styles offered here. Kirstin is one of those people whose lyrical depth and poetic vocal stylings creating a wonderful ""surround sound"" experience for the listener, an aural-emotional treat for those of us who love great music. This is a very enjoyable album!! 5 stars!!"
3,For fans of the genre.,"Kirstin Candy's Another Sweet Mess is a bit of a mix between Alison Morisette's style and Heather Nova's voice. It has some nice summer tunes on it, but the general setting of this album is ""love and peace"" (thus no real new lyrics here people). Not to be mistaken though, the album is far from bad. Her voice is pretty sweet, and the beats are on most track refreshing. The best tracks are Heaven and Let It Flow."
2,doesn't work,"i bought this spray because i live in a new york city apartment with a serious roach problem and i have a dog that's always sniffing around and getting into mischief. i was afraid she might somehow accidentally ingest anything i sprayed around, so i thought i'd try this. unfortunately, it did absolutely nothing. i literally sprayed it directly on a cockroach and it didn't even slow him down. i think he even gave me the finger as he sauntered away. i will say that the scent is actually kind of nice, though...."
1,Don't throw your money away,"I purchased Carrara on the premise that it would expand on the capabilities of Infini-D. Many of the advertised features just do not work. I've downloaded patches from metacreations web site and the program still does not work. There are more bugs in this program than a New York City apartment. Metacreations should be ashamed of themselves. How dare you put this piece of garbage on the market. Somebody call the police, I was robbed."
2,costume only,This is a costume only. I dont even want to refer to it as a jacket because all it is is one cheap layer of fake leather
1,Going nowhere,"Technically good, lots of quirky characters in indoor settings - but - lacking a raison d'etre. Insufficient outdoor, streetscape footage. Hard to get a ""sense of place"". Yes, probably a student film."
1,doesn't work!,I recently bought this product for my 2 year old daughter. First it is packaged so tightly that I had to destroy the packaging in order to open it. Then it didn't work. I followed the instructions exactly. When it failed to work I went online to see if other people liked it and found that others had the same problem. Because I had destroyed the package I felt I couldn't return it so I contacted Little Tikes and they gave me the brush off.
2,Disappointing Phrase Book,"This book is disappointing as a tool for learning to speak Indonesian. It is simply a dialogue book which offers some common (and uncommon) dialogues in Indonesian and then a translation into English. It provides no insight into pronounciation, no glossary of terms, no explanation of grammar and word order, and very little organization to the sections of dialogues provided. If you're interested in learning how to speak Indonesian, I recommend you find another book."
5,"Stirring, interesting, unusual, and beautiful....",What is the world coming to? Throat singers from Tuva forming a rock band and daring to combine two wildly disparate styles. Does it work? Yes... The reviewer below describes this much better than I can. Albert Kuvezin sounds like a force of nature; one with the thunderstorm. This guy sings notes that make Alexander Kipnis sound like a high tenor. Highly recommended!
1,Misleading Title,"Patricia Arant's ""Russian for Reading"" contains very little actual ""Russian"" for ""reading."" This is a grammar textbook, with several paragraphs of reading exercises at the end of each chapter. I was under the impression from the title that the book would consist of readings in Russian. I can't judge its merits as a grammar text, but do not buy this book for readings."
5,Fun!,"My 3 year old loves to bake cookies and muffins in her play kitchen with these. They look like the real thing, only smaller."
5,PAL format not NTSC,"I got my copy directly from Amazon and it is a PAL format DVD. Now I have a player that will play PAL discs but most buyers will not. That said, this is a fantastic concert with great sound and stunningly sharp visuals. Sharon den Adel is not only a very beautiful woman but is perhaps the best female vocalist fronting a metal band, especially now that Tarja is not longer fronting Nightwish.Get it by all means if you're a fan, but just be aware that this is actually a PAL format DVD."
3,Not as good as I hoped,Bought this after buying the Black Symphony. No comparison for me. Guitar wasn't dominant enough. Lacked grind and punch.Keyboard dominated.
1,Sad,"Unfortunately, I didn't get to watch the DVD because I didn't notice that it was in the PAL format before I ordered it, so I had to return the product. I understand, though, that Within Temptation will be releasing a concert on Blu-ray sometime soon, so I hope to get that one when it is released.There wasn't an option for N/A on the star rating."
2,very poor quality concerts,"just stick to the their cd's honestly, I was really looking forward to seeing them live on stage, but they whole thing is like a britney spears concert, all were pretending to play their instruments, and that orchestral arrangments that sounds so good on a cd just looked really bad as a background tape in the concert...they should have hired the proper orechestra to be more authentic, true will cost more money..but thats how art and music should be performed..."
4,Excellent!,But the video isn't so good...At least the sound quality is really good...I just miss an orquestra for this one...
5,AMAZING!,"I recently bought this dvd. I have their other dvd, The Black Symphony. This dvd takes you behind the scenes with Within Temptation, as well as live performances. This is one of the best bands ever. I highly recommend this dvd for those who would like to see the band in some of their earlier years. :)"
4,good cage!,"I got this cage for my short haired hamster, he loves it. he made a borrow under the hamster wheel. He also LOVES the tube... He hangs out in it all the time. The only thing i didnt really like was the two platforms, he never went on them and never got to his water bottle. So I took the two platforms out and got a water dish. This is a really good cage, perfect for my hamster. =^)"
2,Very disappointing,"I was very excited when I found this item as I work with over sized papers so the 18"" size was very attractive. Low and behold however, you can not trim to anything larger than 9"" as there is no swing out arm that extends beyond the 9"" platform. The paper holder also does not lift and the finger guard is 2"" so there is no way to cut anything smaller than 2.5""It is interesting to note that the 12"" PERSONAL model has a swing out arm that extends the measuring and thus cutting size to 18"" -- but none of the PROFESSIONAL models do. I tried to give Carl feedbak on this but the email address they provide is invalid.The Fiskars is a much better deal for the money!"
4,Good heavy-duty cutter,"It is true that it is does not go beyond 9"" width-cut size, and cutting less than 2.5"" can be tricky, but I use my ruler to cut in the opposite direction, and I have no problem. I love how sturdy it is and it's ability to cut very thick cardboard. I have used mine for at least two years, and I would not want to try any other brand or size cutter. The interchangeable blades make it very versatile, and the cutting mat is a breeze to change. I have recommended it to family members."
3,DenebaCAD Circular Compatibility,"Having obtained DenebaCad from the internet and receiving my regestered copy I proceeded to experiment with it's ability to create circles, in this case Monolithic Domes. At first I had a real problem getting the program to perform the way I wanted it to, but once I understood how the program operated it became relatively easy to perform circular operations. I now use Deneba to Draw and perform renderings for Monolithic Dome Structures, such as stadium, churches, and even residential housing. Overall I am very pleased with DenebaCADs performance in the area of Domes. The only complaint I have is the lack of Library objects assosiated with this program. Have to aquire 3d library objects from other sources and often creating them myself was exhausting and time consuming. DenebaCAD is a wonderful program for rendering and showing three demensional structures and works very well for Monolithic Dome buildings."
5,Velocity Design Comfort,This cd has a strong personality. It's vibrant and dense. The sweet music is like an aroma of nostalgia and sentimental happiness.
2,looks nice but waste a lot of coffee,"I bought this because I hated digging in those bags of coffee especially when it got down to the bottom.While this looks very nice I have it next to my coffee pot on the counter, it leaks coffee out the bottom from the time you pick it up (just a tiny bit then) to the time you put it back (note: putting back in tray very gently) it leaks at least a half to three quarters teaspoon out. The tray is helpful at catching some but it is very small and a custom fit to the dispenser, it does not help. I still end up with coffee on the counter. I thought this was going to be a wonderful (especially since it is non-electric)appliance. It turns out I waste way to much coffee. I have just written an email to the company to see if there is a fix for this extra leakage. So I'm not sure if this is common to all. Just know mine is worthless."
5,Not just for coffee!,"We love it! Our doctor told us to sprinkle a tablespoon of ground flax seed on our cereal every morning. We'd kept a plastic container of it on a bottom shelf of the fridge, with a measuring spoon in it to make it easy, but we'd still forget to use it or didn't want to bother with it because it was a mess and a hassle. I had an idea to see if a 1-tablespoon dispenser existed and found this! Once you get used to how close-to-the-back-edge it dispenses (to make sure your bowl is under it!), it works like a charm! We keep it on the top shelf of the fridge and use it ALL the time because it's a constant reminder AND a fun, EASY, non-messy gadget to use! My only wish was that it was dishwasher-cleanable. Not quite sure how we could ever thoroughly clean it out if we decided to dispense something other than ground flax seed; its mechanisms are pretty intricate inside. But my husband and I BOTH use it EVERY day now!"
3,Attractive & practical but leaks coffee grounds.,"leaks coffee grounds, I thoght it mkight just be minr but seems to be many. am looking for another coffee container to replace tired of wiping up behind it."
1,Broken By Design,"I'm very confused how anyone could give this any stars at all. We read the reviews first, and coffee can be messy so we expected a little spills. This however was far worse than we expected. This is incredibly inaccurate and it leaks large amounts of coffee. The only way this could work was if you were using a very large grinds. Definitely not worth the money and it has been returned. Out of roughly 500 products purchased from Amazon this is my second return."
2,toliet seat,"It was the wrong item - and my husband threw out all the packaging, so I don't know how to return? Can you help?I needed an elongated seat."
5,My mom loves it,If you know someone who loves puzzles this is the picture puzzle book to get them with a large variety of puzzles.
4,huge,this is definitely one of the biggest sudoku books i have seen and definitely will keep me busy for a while
5,gift,this was also sent to our daughter in prison - she has 3 more years to go and there are 400 puzzles in this book!
3,"""Mammoth"" no more?","I just received a copy to give as a gift. The cover no longer says ""Mammoth."" I hope it's still the same book everyone else has reviewed!I may adjust the rating at a later time depending on how much my wife likes it, but suffice to say the title change causes me concern."
4,A good gift,"I bought this book for and gave it as a gift to someone in a different state. I never saw the book; however, that person was grateful for the number and varying difficulty of the assorted puzzles."
4,the mammoth book of sudoku,"my husband and I have both enjoyed the book, it has largevarity of puzzles some easy, some hard. I received the book inDec of 05 and am still working on it"
4,A treat for the Sudoku addict,"I simply can't put it down. They have various levels of difficulty, new twists and variations on the Sudoku puzzles, and just much more fun!"
2,The Mammoth Book of Sudoku,The puzzles are good but the book itself is extremely difficult to work with. The puzzles are small and the book is so thick that it is uncomfortable to work with. Far from my favorite Sudoku book.
4,Good way to pass time,"This is a good sudoku book. It has the usual 9 x 9 sudoku grids, in levels of difficulty ranging from easy to hard. It has cool 12 x 12 grids that are very fun to do, as well as 16 x 16 grids which are a bit difficult. I really enjoyed the interlinking sudoku puzzles, the up and down section, the spiral puzzle section, and the math sudoku section that requires adding skills. The grid size is nice, but a touch smaller than you would see in your local newspaper. The paper quality could be better to make erasing wrong answers less of a pain. I would recommend this book over all of the other sudoku books on the market right now. I have a number of books, and this one is the best and most fun to do. However, if you would like to tote the book on the plane or train, this is not the one for you. It is the size of a guiness book of world records, and inconvenient to do anywhere but at home. But the puzzles are better. So it's a trade off. If you buy only one sudoku book, buy this one."
3,"Not ""legal"" Sudoku","Sudoku puzzles are supposed to be symmetrical. (The filled in boxes on one side or corner should be the mirror image of the filled in boxes on the opposite side or corner. Not the same numbers, just the same boxes.) The ones in this book are not. Does it mean that they can't be solved or they won't be fun? Probably not. But it's a little like cheating because being symmetrical may change the level of difficulty."
5,A must-read for any southerner,"This is an interesting, delightful read, which will make any Southerner, and, for that matter, any American, stop and think about the way things were. As suggested by Guice in the foreword, ""There is hardly a 'plain vanilla' or 'B-flat' sentence in the entire book,"" and, indeed, there is not, as this book reads like a story, as opposed to a typical historical record. The author quite successfully describes ""what happened"" in terms of the tactile, visual, olfactory and auditory. A terrific account by a fascinating historian."
2,"An challenging, yet confusing book",Good:Easy-to-understand examplesFirst half of the book are comprehensibleBad:Second half of the book are vagueThe examples has nothing to do with some of the questions
3,Book in great condition but slow to arraive,"This book was in great used condition but it took about 7 days for it to arrive due to a 2 day delay in shipping, and by that time, I had found another one to buy. I also ordered a used physics book at the same time but it was shipped very quickly and immediately put to good use."
3,O.K. for a math book,"I thought that the information was presented in an easy enough to understand format, and with ample examples. For anyone that wants to learn geometry, this is the book you want."
4,Avoid carring a heavy book home! Thanks to Amazon!,"We bought this due to the amount of homework our 8th grader had every night. This prevents the entire contents of his locker from traveling home every night. The book shipped quickly, was in good shape and was what we needed."
3,It's a typical modern textbook...,This book is for my son's summer class. It's a typical modern textbook - bigger and heavier than and not as good as the book I used and still have that was first published in 1962.
5,Montalbano,"Montalbano is my favorite ""Commissario"". His series never disappoints, and you will love his office colleagues as they present their chief with personal problems which somehow get intertwined in the criminal investigation. Little violence, no foul language, and a lot of interesting Sicilians who will amuse and add to the story."
4,I am s great fan of Andrea Camillieri,"Recommend these episodes for all mystery fans. But start with earlier episodes, then get up to speed.Don't miss this series/"
1,Inspector Montalbano Episodes 21-22,I live in Austrlaia and I was sent a DVD that is not for my region. Therefore I cannot play it and would like to swap it for one that I can play. I am annoyed that none in Amazon has returned my request. Thank you
1,CRAP! CRAP! CRAP! CRAP! CRAP! CRAP! CRAP! CRAP!,This movie is a waste of valuable time. Do not punish yourself by seeing this crapfest. Enough said. The following is for anyone who gave this scum three or more stars: (...)
2,Not as good as it should be,"I read the bad reviews before going to see this movie. I refused to belive it when they said that there were no laughs to be found within the first half hour. They were right. The theatre I saw it in was stone cold silent for that time-seriously!! No one was laughing, not even me.This goes to show how vastly underused the cast of this movie was, especially with solid actors like Jack Black, Ben Stiller, Christopher Walken, Rachel Weisz and SNL's Amy Poehler, who are all usually hilarious! That being said, Envy is a cute comedy that has some minor laughs and even a few good laughs. Unfortunately, the good laughs are a little too few and far between to make this a great movie. It is still watchable, though.Also, in several scenes, the boom mikes are very plainly in view. I dont' just mean the tops either, I mean the entire mikes! Maybe the studio just didnt' care. We'll see if the DVD rectifies this.Watch this movie if you must, but keep your expectations way low."
1,Ben Stiller and Jack Black... WHAT A COMBINATION...,"I'm a big fan of Ben Stiller and Jack Black- So I picked this DVD from many comedy choices because you can't go wrong with Ben AND Jack combo, right? right?? right???Wow.. this movie blew me away...I was just sitting and watching while thinking about what I'm gonna eat for dinner...I write reviews when I wanna tell people how great this video game or DVD is... But I'm writing today to warn you to skip this one; I don't know what it is, but Ben and Jack combo didn't workout.IF YOU WANT TO SPEND YOUR MONEY TO FRUSTRATE YOURSELF, THEN PLEASE GO AHEAD. OTHER THAN THAT...SKIP IT."
2,I want my money back,"This movie was such a let down. Ben Stiller and Jack Black usually make me laugh. Not the case with this movie. At least not often. I wanted to like it, I really did.The problems? A weak script, hardly any really funny scenes, and two actors who are used to working with much better material.I'm not going to go into the plot, but I will say that the movie had potential and that movies like this inspire the average man to try his hand at screenwriting.See ya next review."
3,Pretty good!!!,"I know so many people who did not like Envy. In fact, test audiences hated it so much, the film would have gone straight to video had it not been for the success of the totally overhyped School of Rock. But I enjoyed Envy. Granted, it wasn't Oscar material, but hey, I don't think Lord of the Rings was either. Moulin Rouge yes. Chicago definitely. But Envy is what it is, a cute, funny, enjoyable comedy with a great cast and a unique story. Perhaps that's why audiences were turned off. When's the last time anything unique was enjoyed by audiences? I think Envy is judged way too harshly and should be given a chance, especially for fans of Ben Stiller or Jack Black.This isn't their best movie, but it's a very fun one. Grade: B-"
2,More Ennui Than Envy,"Despite a promising premise this flick just doesn't work. Either it's in the script or in Barry Levinson's lackluster direction, regardless, ""Envy"" just lays there. Ben Stiller is too much of a wimp to be capable of anything diabolical. Jack Black's character is too nice to be truly interesting. The movie is saved somewhat by Christopher Walken as a scheming transient type. Time and again Walken has appeared in a film of dubious quality and turned a sow's ear into a silk purse. As far as his efforts here he shouldn't have bothered. I hope he was well compensated."
3,"Could have been so much more, but still funny at times","Although this movie was a mediocre comedy at best, it's probably better than half the comedies on the new release shelf at your local video store. Ben Stiller and Jack Black make a great duo, although the aspect of Envy that did not work was that the story line was a little weak in it's development. They could have done more with Ben Stiller's character when he sees his best friend (Jack Black) get rich overnight with a spray that vaporizes dog poop. He is envious, but the movie itself seems lack a clear direction at times. Certainly there are funny aspects to the movie, but, as often is the case with Ben Stiller movies, it is a subtle kind of humor. For instance, at one point he abruptly blows up at his boss after the pressure to live up to his neighbor gets to be too much for him. Overall, this wasn't bad, but they could have done so much more for this."
2,2 And A Half,"Although some people say this movie is horrible, it actually isn't. It's no Hollywood gem, but it's not a Haunted Mansion or The Order. Sure, A genious pairing like Black and Stiller was used horribly, but if you think of this movie as a drama, and not a comedy, it's not too bad. Plus, Christopher Walken nails the role which enables him to make this movie a little bit comical. Stiller plays the same neurotic, worrying loser, like always, and Black plays his same old spunky, upbeat, likable character which we loved in the underrated Saving Silverman and the amazing School Of Rock. If you give this movie a chance, and don't sit down expecting anything funny, then this movie won't be a waste of time."
3,Basically Plot,"Envy Is a humorus tale of 2 ppl,One Played by Jack Black whose life is stuck up. and Ben Stiller,a, ""unemployed (...)"" who befriends J.B. who makes ""Vapoorise"",Something that makes poop dissolve in this spoof of ""the big kahuna"".It is a good movie untill the end,when all of the preachiness breaks out"
2,Broken case and skipping scenes,"When I received this the case was cracked including the spindle that holds the DVD. We watched the movie regardless and found that we had to skip a scene as the disk was damaged in that area. I give this a rating 2 as we were able to watch most of this movie and the case damage was superficial. If you don't mind the possibility of a cracked case or possibly slightly damaged disk, fine, but I would not recommend this seller to a friend."
3,Decent movie,"This movie wasn't that bad. It was a decent movie, with some funny moments. It is well worth $5 at Wal-Mart, If your like me and are a fan of Jack Black and or Ben Stiller, then this is a must own for your collection."
2,"It's ok, but nothing special","Another one of the million films Ben Stiller puts out every year this time is about a man whose best friend invents a spray that vaporises dog poop, and the man becomes jelous when he could have had the rich life to if he only invested in the idea his friend had. Then his best friend is stinking rich and he's poor and it gets to him over the months, he gets drunk and his rage he kills the rich guys horse and meets a bum in a bar whose gonnah help him hide the horse and then he becomes rich himself *yawn* and blah blah blah.....The movie has a few laughs, but nothing memorable. You'd think Jack Black, Christopher Walken & Ben Stiller might make a terrific cast, but the script just isnt all that funny.The movies all right, but nothing speical. just rent it"
2,way too boring...ZZZZZZZZZ,"i rented this film from blockbuster, really wanting a good laugh. i wanted to like this movie, i really did. as a native of Baltimore and a huge fan of both Jack Black and Ben Stiller, i wanted to love this movie, and i really expected to, because i dont know of a bad movie with jack black or ben stiller. until now. the film starts out well, looks like it could be entertaining but about a half hour into it i was forcing myself not to fall asleep. it was so boring, i laughed maybe once, and that was a little chuckle. the movie is watchable before Black becomes rich, it provokes a giggle or two, but his invention takes off about 20 minutes into it and the film goes downhill fast. You would think Stiller could make a funny or two at this point, but, sadly, no. i turned it off a half hour into it and watched Collateral. dont waste your money"
1,corny wack Movie,"Ben Stiler is the kind of Cat that I can respect for keeping a Actign Hustle going,but His films are so fluffy&lame it hurts. Jack Black has Potential but is trapped into One trick Pony status as a Actor.this film is boring from start to finish&never reaches a point of hitting at what it was suppose to."
5,Pretty good movie!,"This is not such a bad movie but funny, funny, funny. It has some laughs to give and a pretty good plot. See it or you have missed a good comedy!"
2,I work at 3M... and know how they feel...,"Some friends told me about a movie called ""Envy"" where the main characters work at 3M. Being a long-time 3Mer, I was very interested in seeing how our company was portrayed. Let's just say that apart from the (authentic) plaques and posters on the office wall, the hard hats and smocks in production areas, and the unforgiving (yet inaccurately represented) performance appraisal system -- these guys could have worked for any company.As for the quality of this movie overall, you either like Stiller and Black or you don't. I am generally less-than-amused by these guys. However, I did get a few chuckles from their antics this time. The relatively sex-free humor is mostly geared torward an adolescent audience.This is the kind of movie I'd put on when I'm only willing to give it half my attention."
1,The worst Ben Stiller and Jack black movie ever made,"Wow, I just recently seen this and I have to say it was bad! Both Ben stiller and Jack black are funnier in any other movie than this one. The humor is very dry, I found my self getting bored with it, I wasn't laughing and the movie was getting very corny, but not in a good way. It just got to the point of being dumb. I stopped the movie of the way in and did not care how it ended. If you must watch these 2 actors, stick with movies like dodge ball, school of rock, or meet the fockers. This movies stinks. I would rather pull my eyes out with a fork than watch this again."
3,"the Vapo""O""rise....... where does the s**t go?? it is funny!","I always enjoy movies by Ben Stiller and Jack Black and this one is not an exception, i have to say Envy might not be as funny as Zoolander or School of Rock, but that doesn't mean that it is not a good comedy. Both characters, Nic and Tim, are very stand-out, they both have their own personality, and Black did really well as the never-stop-thinking Nic, who always have a lot of big idea, but never been admitted by Tim (Stiller), Stiller performance is shadowed by the exaggerated performance by Black, which is much more enjoyable."
2,(...) up!!!!!!!!!!,this movie was totally (...) in manyways. It was a so Terriable I couldnot watch the rest of it. i gave it 2 stars cause I like Ben Stiller and Jake Black. But in this moviethey were F**kin lame. I would not buythis movie just rent it ifyou are so F**kin bored and have nothin to do at all.g2g so peace all you Ben stiller and Jake Blake Fans.
2,I envy the guy that hasn't seen this,"This film is anti funny. It sucks fun out of the air. It has an intersting premise, a cast with incredible potential, but seems like a morality play rather than an all out comedy. I kept waiting for J Black to cut loose and for B Stiller to wallow in a funny overdone pool of self pity. Don't happen. The film also also seems to have a cheapness about it that doesn't help sell it either. This film is a misfire wandering down a strange path."
5,How does this movie only have 3 stars?!?!?!,"This movie is funny...really funny...it's great story with tons of of truths about envy, life, and wanting what someone else has....It's one of the things that can truly make a person unhappy with their life, envy is...they did a great job making a comedy out of it...plus, there's a great Christopher Walken character that adds to the comedy...It's a great flick...underrated and not as well known as it should be...."
1,"First Time For Everything, I Guess...","I have never walked out of a movie and demanded a refund before. I went to go see this with a friend on a school night at 10:30 PM and it was so horrible that about half-way through this film about VAPOORIZE and a freakin' dead horse, we decided we'd rather go to sleep... We are teenagers and we'd rather go home on a schoolnight than stay out. I love Jack Black and Ben Stiller. But this just sucked. I mean, if you for some reason have to miss the ending of almost any movie, you always wonder ""how does it end?""... I couldn't care less what happens to Corky... I am very disappointed... The advertisements on TV and in the theatres made it look hilarious, I'm sorry I just didn't enjoy this movie at all, for God's sake... We walked out of it... Go see the Punisher.. fantastic movie!! :)"
3,Two Great comedy Actors= One O.K. movie.,"Jack Black and Ben Stiller are teamed together in thisbland, but somewhat likeable comedy about dog doo-doo spray.Christopher Walken also appears in the movie and almoststeals the spotlight. If you love Black or Stiller movies,you should be able to tolerate this strange little movie.Just be sure that you can accept the absurd premise, and thatwill help a lot."
5,El mejor grupo de rock mexicano,"Una excelente banda de rock que juntan diversas corrientes musicales como el jazz, funk y rock para crear finalmente su propio estilo. Definitivamente la mejor voz femenina dentro del rock mexicano. Un grupo para escuchar del disco directamente para poder disfrutar la calidad musical."
5,As excellent as the 2nd OST,"Perfect,as always! .hack music is definately top of my favorite video game music list. A must have for all .hack fans~"
4,Great value,"This step stool is very light, folds easily, is very sturdy and allows me to reach the highest cabinet in the kitchen. I do wish the steps were a bit wider though."
3,Xtend 4 step ladder,"This ladder is lightweight & easy to open. The steps are alittle narrow but for quick use it's just what I needed. I'd have to say that I was very disappointed in the condition of the ladder when it arrived. It was just in light weight plastic which was torn. When we removed it from the plastic, we noticed the last rung on the ladder was bent. The damaged rung doesn't affect the use of the ladder at least for my purposes but that's not the point. A brand new ladder should not have had any damages. I sent an email to the supplier & did not get a reply. Since I was in need of this ladder & the damaged area didn't affect me using the ladder, I've kept it."
5,Great Ladder,"I have this 4-step ladder and the 2-step sister model. I love it! I'm short so have many ""height enhancers"" but this gets used more than anything in my house - great for changing light bulbs in the ceiling, reaching high shelves or cabinets, fits inside the closet better than a full-size ladder, light weight, strong. The top step is oversized and easy to stand on and you have a rail to hold for long jobs, but the other 3 steps are smaller, so they aren't as easy to stand on for long periods, but for short jobs in tight spaces, this is made for just that purpose."
4,thank you,My 3 year old had this same monkey and I lost it....it was tragic to say the least... This monkey saved me... Great quality... Shipped very fast! recommended... My soon goes no where with out him!
4,Russ Berrie Curious George is the best,"This plush toy is very soft and cuddly. Since it doesn't make noise or play music or do tricks, it doesn't have any hard peices that make it uncomfortably to cuddle. I bought it for a 14-month old who loves to watch Curious George on TV. I would have rated this toy higher if he had taken to it but he hasn't had anything to do with it. I'm hoping he will sometime in the future. Of all the Curious George plush toys out there, I found this to be the most attractive and closest to the actual cartoon character. Good value for the money."
5,Perfect Curious George Plush,"This plush is exactly what I was looking for. The toy looks just like Curious George does on TV, is a good size, and is very soft!"
4,Great Monkey!,My son got this Curious George for his 2nd birthday. He loved it! It is very well made and nice and soft. Very nice product. No complaints!
2,what happened?LEXX season 3&4,Some where in the two series something happened.I think some one left out a disk or missed part of story in two different times. i think they missed something while copying it.Thank you LEXX seasons 3&4
3,Does not fit small cordless Wahl.,"There is a mistake in the description and label on this. This did not fit the newer small-head cordless wahl. I don't know how many stars to give this, it might be great for the right thing."
2,crummy blades,"I bought a couple of these to use for surgical preps, but found them duller than the usual steel blades. Don't waste your money."
1,bad,The blade fit my trimmer and was easy to attach but... it broke in half the first time I used it.
1,poor pour,"yes, it looks good in my blue kitchen. but the water doesn't pour cleanly out of the spout - it's more like uncontrollable spewing, even when ""poured"" slowly, and boiling water splashes all over the counter. also very difficult to fully empty. sorry I threw out the box, or I'd send back."
2,it's a bargain for a reason,"i purchased this tea kettle because it was inexpensive and i am stingy. however upon receiving my ""steal of a teapot"" i was disappointed to discover that it was poorly designed. when you try to pour the boiling water into your tea cup the steam (because of lackluster engineering) flares up right into your poor unsuspecting hands. this hurt. quite a bit. if youre going to be a cheapo about buying a tea kettle at least make sure it is not a death trap first."
5,Great Cd,"These girls have put together a very good mixture of Indie, Rock and a little bit of Folk. Just got into them about a year ago. Bought 3 of their albums. I like them all. Will be buying a 4th shortly."
5,A must have!,This cd is part of my favorite cd's collection a must have for any tegan and sara fans.
5,great cd!,"I saw their video ""speak slow"" on the mtv2 show 'Subterranean' and was immediately drawn to their music. The album is pretty good. My favorite songs are ""You wouldn't like Me"" ""I Know I know I know"" ""I Won't be Left"" ""Speak Slow"" ""I Can't Take It"" and my favorite ""Walking With A Ghost""."
2,whiny,"I'm not a diehard Tegan & Sara fan, unlike most people writing reviews here, it seems. Listening to this album at a friend's place recently was the first time I ever heard of Tegan & Sara. Their voices had that really whiny quality, and I personally found it annoying and difficult to listen to. The music was outstanding, and I will admit that they are quite talented, but I just didn't like it overall."
1,Walking With a Ghost is the standout track...,"I saw Tegan and Sara perform live when they opened for The Killers in L.A. a few months ago. I thought they sounded very familiar, very The Go Gos, very 80s, very Belinda sings Joan Jett. I recognized the track Walking With a Ghost, and that is a catchy single, I'll admit. Yet nothing else sounded remotely original. If you are already familiar with the likes of The Go Gos, or The Runaways, or heck, even the Bangles, you won't be able to think of anything else when listening to Tegan and Sara. Watching them perform was so unmoving, I actually thought they might be an alt.Christian group or something. Rock out to Jewel or Veruca Salt instead."
2,Not impressed...,"The songs on this record are far less intelligent and introspective than previous T&S tunes - showing a kind of downward trend in their songwriting. It is almost as if little to no time or effort was put into this record - the lyrics are juvenile and mundane at best, and echo the same themes as their previous effort, If It Was You. Musically, doubled vocals do not help the tracks..and I don't know how much more I can take chords strummed on the downbeat in 4/4 time...Nothing interesting happening here...I'd love to see T&S return to their ""roots"" of interwoven guitar and edgy vocals - what they do best."
4,Not every day.,"I don't think this is one of those albums you can listen to everyday like Frou Frou but it truley is amazing. I found this group on Sirius (better than just any normal radio). ""Walking with a Ghost"" was my first hit, I was in love with that song from the start. After a few times of replaying the entire album I was especially fond of ""Downtown"". The only down about this album is the lyrics - catchy but nothing inspiring or that I can relate to. I suggest this very much it does make you jump around."
5,this album got me though a tough breakup,"I remember listening to this album non stop after a particularly tough breakup. I was the dumpee. There are so many songs on here that capture the pain and loneliness you feel after, and the lack of self worth. I mean this in the best way. The best thing is that listening to this made me feel not so alone because I knew these girls clearly went thought it and were able to put it into song and lyrics."
4,i like it but the last album was has been the best so far,"I found Tegan and Sara in Sept of 2003 in my home town of Vancouver BC Canada which is where the girls live at times if I'm correct there. I have seen these two perform in concert and they are great live. The new album is great but I like their older stuff so far. Their last album helped me change my life and their song ""City Girl"" from thier last album is my absolute favorite it was what got me hooked to these gals. And any girl from Van will tell ya the song fits the city.I hope that the next album is as good as all of these but sorry i'm still a bigger fan on your last album, it seemed to me to define them more than this album.Tina"
3,"Okay, not great.","Shipping time was great. arrived a day ahead of schedule, but in a cheap crappy paper bag thing.Don't be fooled by the picture, the belt is Much smaller than it looks on the net and has only five holes, so youd better guess right with your size, or be prepared to drill a new hole.Arrived with, what i thought was, a deep ragged scratch across the buckle, but, it turned out to be a smudge of dark greasy dirt-like something.other than that, the leather is nice and soft (but not overly so) and it's really very functionally inginuitive and convienient to have a reversable black/brown belt in your closet."
4,very nice belt,very good deal the reversable is awsome scratches easily is why only 4 stars but worth the money!
1,"Cheap Price, Cheap Belt","First of all the sizing is off, I had to buy an XL and I'm a size 8.Secondly, after using it only a couple of times it's pretty much falling apart. the black portion is seperating from the brown and break apart. The brown portion is wearing down a lot. it looks like i've been wearing this belt for years when it has only been a month.I do not recommend this product."
5,Great Television,I don't know what the one guy is talking about yeah Bravo reran the 6 episodes that's it. But nonetheless it was a verry compelling and and entertaining 6 episodes. I only wish that they didn't cancel the show it had a lot of potential for future episodes. But I am greatfull that they came out with it on DVD definitely a must buy.
4,WORTH THE MONEY,"IF YOU DON'T WANT TO BUY THE SERIES IT IS REALLY WORTH RENTING, THERE ARE SOME VERY GRAPHIC PARTS BUT IN ALL NOT TO BAD COMPARED TO ALOT OF OTHER SHOWS."
4,Pretty damn good,"This was a very interesting drama series, it was not quite the Godfather because it was a more modern day mob story. I think it's more comparable to the Sopranos and was action packed all through unlike the Soprano's that has the tendency to drag. Another reviewer complained about it not having a perfect ending but I don't think the producer intended to have just a season, unfortunately they didn't get an extension. Definetely worth watching and I wished there were more seasons."
4,Like dvd,"I wish i would have seen fine print if any, but i wish it would have come with the original cover."
5,One of the Best Series ever on NBC!!!,"Kingpin was one of thee best shows ever produced on NBC! The characters are not A list actors, yet they do a great job.The price cannot be beat either! When the DVD set first came out I paid around fifty bucks through the television site! Here at Amazon it's a fraction of the cost!"
2,Not a fan of the Talking Kitchen Food Set,"This never got played with in our house. It was just too ""fake"" for my daughter's liking."
3,NOT meant for the critics,"Mary Kate and Ashley...Saved by the Bell..""After School Specials""...From Justin to Kelly.If you love campy, cute, innocent entertainment...then this is for you (or more likely your 12 year old daughter). Script is the worst I've seen in a while, but Kelly and Justin do their best with it. Great songs...where is the soundrack already!"
2,close but no cigar!,"Kelly Clarkson is perhaps the most tallented singer in todays mainstream music and Justin, well he's just Justin. I didn't really expect much from the movie but it was worse than I thought. The singing was fabulous though. Songs and diolaugue were poorly written but the acting(at least from Kelly and Justin)was pretty good. Over all it was a terrible movie but if you are a Kelly or a Justin fan it can't hurt to see it."
1,Wouldn't waste the cost of a ticket for this Hype,"This movie shows people get dumber and dumber for entertainment.Fame has real talent and is handled professionally..but I hope they do not go this 'fleece the public' mechandising route and secure real jobs and credible agents from their diversified talents. This film would be good for preteens; but after the age of 13, some intelligence factor has to set in..."
1,RANKS AMONG THE WORST EVER,"This was a terrible film. Justin and Kelly both proved to the entire world that they can't act and of the two of them, only Kelly has even decent vocal abilities.Each musical number is slopped between over-acting and horribly written dialogue that fails miserably and meeting its obvious pop-culture savvy intentions.I've never seen such a poorly pieced together film, and I did - in fact - happen to catch a little film called Spice World. None of the scenes seem to have anything to do anything else and half of the music is irrelevent to the situation.And I won't even get in to the choreography, so let's just leave it at the fact that this ranks along the likes of Envy, Starsky & Hutch, Spice World, and Gigli with the worst films ever made."
1,Worst Movie Ever!,"What can I say? This wasted precious time of my life. Good thing I saw it for free, but that's not saying much. Those idols should be proud of their fellow peers for making the worst movie ever made. Yes, Simon Calwell knows what he's talking about when he sees talent. There was so much singing in ""From Justin to Kelly,"" I wanted to get up and start break-dancing and kick the tv screen in. The acting was grotesquely ugly and it would've made Medusa go back in the darkness where she came from. I don't think I can ever step foot on a beach again after watching this horrible misery. I'm scarred for life."
5,I love this movie,This is one of my favorite movies of all time. The stream was fabulous and the rent price was even better!
3,entertaining,"If you are a Kelly Clarkson Fan, and love to hear her sing, then you will love this movie. The movie is a beach movie somewhat like Frankie Avalon and Annette Funicello did back in the day. There is a plot and lots of cool songs sung only as Kelly can. Young folks and a little older folks who have followed Kelly's career, will enjoy this movie."
1,SOO Disappointing,"I so wanted this movie to be a success, but unless you're looking for a comedy, it's terrible. We went to see the movie and it was painful to watch. All we could do is laugh. You actually feel embarrased for Kelly. She is so talented that you wonder how they could miss on this movie...but they did BIG TIME! The only saving grace was Kelly's amazing voice. I don't even think it's worth waiting for the video. Wait for the soundtrack."
5,Awesome Musical!,"i truly loved this movie! Me and my friend Tracy saw it on a tuesday, and we were the only ones in the theatre, but it was a very good movie, I loved it! you should see it!"
3,Not The Best,"Before people think that Kelly was stupid for doing this i got something to say. She didnt WANT to do it. They FORCED her to. She tried everything to get outta it.Okey Dokey, back to the movie.I wasnt a fan of Kelly's when I saw the movie. And seeing it didnt MAKE me a 'fan'. Thats another story. I love Kelly, but this movie isnt that great...at all. Its more of a GUILTY pleasure, like several other viewers have said. Ive seen it twice, and will probably buy it, just to add to my Kelly Collection. The movie is an average storyline, with people breaking out dance moves to songs that come from no where every now and then. If you see this movie with NO expectations, you will probably find it somewhat entertaining. Like Napoleon Dynamite...anyways, this movie is in my top 20, mainly because its very laughable and easygoing. unlike most of the stuff Hollywood puts out there these days"
4,a decent spring brake movie,i dont care what others say. i liked this movie. it was good. and often funny. though some of the dance sequences were corny and 2 songs suck.......its still good whether there singing or not im entertained. i recomend this movie.
4,If you are a Justin & Kelly Fan you are going to LOVE IT !!!,"If you are a fan of Kelly & Justin you are going to love this movie. It was meant for their fans. Kelly is adorable, and two of the songs in this movie are destined for greatness (Anytime & Timeless). It is a lot better than people are giving it credit for. I am a fan of both of them and I love it.Considering it was shot on a shoe string budget in six weeks with little acting background I was amazed at just how good it is.Unfortunatly there are still many out there that still think this is a competition with their favorte from American Idol 1st season and will most assuredly use the median to futher their discontentment and trash the movie.If you want to see a a superstar in the making, and you watch this movie for what it is, a fun light hearted musical, you are going to love it."
5,*BEST TEEN MUSICAL*,"This movie has all that a teen needs. Music,teen jokes, and a website where you can download all the songs from the movie (...)Also has Kelly Clarkson and Justin Guarini which are from American Idol and almost evry teen watches that. So see this movie and check out the web site NOW!"
4,Review 22131,I liked this movie. Although i did find it a little confusing at times. Overall its a great movie.
1,chaos princess,"This was one of the worst films i have ever seen I would have rather had root canal than watch this botched slice of cinema. I only gave it a one because Clarkson's beauty, It will become the joke of Hollywood and gather dust on vidio store in Amercia. Not to mention a enbarassment to the producers of Amercian Idol."
1,ANOYING PERIOD!,"Wow! can this movie get anymore anoying, what a lame movie, why didn't Salem the cat of Sabrina make a special appereance?, so wrong."
1,i'd give it less than 1 star if i could,"now i'm pretty open minded when it comes to renting movies, so i decided to give from justin to kelly a chance....MISTAKE!!!!!! this is the most terrible movie i have ever seen in my life. the songs suck, the acting sucks, the plot sucks, and justin and kelly have no on-screen chemistry what-so-ever. please save your money. don't even watch it when it comes on cable!"
2,It was alright,"This movie was alright. I'm a huge Kelly fan! I dragged my mom and brother to the movie, and of course, they didn't like it. When I first heard about the movie, I knew that it was going to bomb, and it it. $3.8 million, or something like that. I think that if Kelly wasn't in it, then it would be worse ratings then that! I'm still buying the soundtrack (if there will be one), and the DVD."
3,It's nothing special.,"Why Lip-syncing? I thought America put them through as incredible singers. If their making a movie, that is a musical, with two of the greatest undiscovered talents of 2002, then why have them mouthing the words throughout these terrific songs. As they mouthed most of them, I kept thinking that too much voice is coming out of them as they sit curled up in the front of a boat. It looks fake.I rate this movie at 5/10. No higher!"
1,PAINFUL!,"This movie represents what is absolutely wrong with the marketing machinery in Hollywood. Play on the hype of a dreary ""reality TV"" series, advertise the thing to death, invest as little as possible in script and story, milk a bunch of unfortunate teeny boppers dry and then release it to video and start all over again.This movie should have gone straight to video and then been canceled.The good news here (or the bad news if you're Kelly or Justin) is that this production and the careers of the principles will alot the obligatory fifteen minutes of fame and then we can go on to the next failed fad.Frankie and Annette (well on their way to senior citizenship) can breathe a sigh of relief. Justin and Kelly and this preposterous movie didn't even make a dent."
4,A Fun Summer Movie,I got this DVD because I am a big fan of Kelly Clarkson. I had heard the movie wasn't very good but when I watched it I was really surprised! I LOVED it!!! It's a really fun movie. I would recommend this movie to any fans of Kelly or Justin and anyone who likes musicals with lots of great dancing!
1,what has this world come to???,ok first of all i'd like to say that justin and kelly don't have bad voices but they can't act worth their life. It is a sterio-typical movie with a predictable plot and stupid songs. Please don't waste your money on this sucky film!
2,Predictable,"I just saw this movie and was disapointed. I was not attracted by the plot, but I am a fan of kelly Clarkson so I was excited to see it. The dancingwas explicit for anyone under 12. The movie ""Blue Crush"" was rated PG-13 for 'teen party-ing.' This movie, if rated for that, would be R! The plot is not original. However, although all the singing got to be stupid, the music was pretty good. So, all in all, a 3 out of ten, and a disapointment. WARNING! Explicit for those under the pre-teen age. Whipped cream bikinis? Booty-shakin? Bikini-wearin? Are all understatements, so beware...partly entertaining, but don't take the younger ones! is the bottom line."
1,Nice music.,"Horrible movie. Bad acting, terrible storyline. The writer of this movie is related to Simon Fuller, so that explains why this monstrosity could have been released.Songs are ok. I like Kelly, so that made up for it a little."
3,Just for Fun,"Justin To Kelly is not as bad as everyone told me it was. It is not on Oscar winning level but for a fun in the sun movie it's fine. It is meant to entertain you for a little while, and it succeeds in that. The plot is a little flimsy and predictable but the music and fun, light hearted nature of the movie make it a enjoyable watch."
4,Good if made in 1978!,"On American Idol I loved Justin's big hair and sex appeal,and also Kelly's big voice. The two made AI what it is today! Now the movie is good and lively,but it flopped due to no ratings and no ratings because it's a musical. Most musicals par badly in these ages because so many were made in the past. Now if this movie were made in 1997 with Grease or Sound Of Music it would've been a winner! I was fortunate enough to see this movie a short time in theathers;and it was better than Grease to me. What's sad is this movie didn't even get to be well rated or reviewed. It was rushed out to press by RCA and 19 E.I highly reccommend this movie to fans of Kelly or Justin as they make the film shine. Good music,good acting,good effort!"
1,If only there was a 0 star rating...,"To call this sugar coated, pointless, poorly acted and directed, digusting display of pure commercial a 'movie' is a great insult to the endless number of other films that are a billion times better. My god, I would rather watch Mariah Carey's 2001 mega-flop ""Glitter"" than this summer slop any day.Let's see: A cute couple who meet during spring break and fall for eachother while dancing and singing in the Miami heat. Not only is the movie itself aweful, it's also a cheap rip-off of the classic ""Grease."" If there is a single good thing about this film, it's Kelly Clarkson's voice. She is, indeed, a great vocalist. Guarini, on the other hand, pales in comparison. Crooning along side Kelly doesn't really do Justin any good. If anything, it just proves that she is a superior singer.Overall, I wouldn't waste precious time watching this summer fizzle again."
4,why i love FROM JUSTIN TO KELLY,"Being an american idol fan, A huge kelly clarkson fan, and just recently a justin guarini fan, i enjoyed seeing this movie. It was fun, and romantic. I thought that kelly and justin's acting was good. I recomend seeing this movie while you can."
5,Love it!,I really loved this movie! It showed lots of talent from several different singer/actors. There should really be a soundtrack to this and I'm dissapointed there won't be!
4,Not that bad...,"From reading the mixed reviews of ""From Justin to Kelly"", I didn't know quite what to expect when I went to see it. All I can say is it's not as bad as some people have said it is. I felt that I really started connecting with the main characters (especially Kelly and her friends). The music was outstanding as well (except for Justin butting into ""Anytime"" - a song that Kelly does amazingly on her own.) This movie probably wouldn't entertain adults; however, teens may find it intriguing."
1,drbraxy this is the worst,"34,in reality, you're 34 like I am 34. This pre-packaged 'turd' stunk from thought to finish. Comparing this to Grease, wake up. This dvd on its very best day can be thought of, as well, a utter useless (let be bend over...pause...and dump) crap. If anyone buys this........I have two hookers that like to tongue bum for 1 buck! This dvd STINKS"
4,ANYTIME YOU NEED LOVE...,"This movie had some seriously bad acting. There wasn't a single person in this movie that could act. But I still love this movie because, Yeah the storyline is a little bit corny, but I loved the singing. They were all great singers in this movie. If your the kind of person that can get past bad acting, then you should rent this movie. If you love musicals you'll love this movie!"
1,Don't buy!,"I like Kelly and Justin from American Idol so when this came out I went to go see it in the movie theather. There was only about 3 other people in there too. That should have been a sign. The story line is okay, but every time they get into a semi-good part they brake out into a CORNY song and dance. But if u can with stand the annoying dancing, are an american idol fan, or just like musicals, then u will enjoy this movie or just think it's okay."
1,STUPID movie,"My mom, cousin, and I went to see this movie on opening day. Well, bad news- it's not even worth renting. The dancing should have made the movie R! Geesh, the people might as well have been in bed, it was so nasty!!!! The movie was very cheesy. The onlyredeeming thing was that Justin and Carlos were both very attractive and sweet. Carlos was HOT! But, I HATED the movie. I mean, my mom, cousin, and I were laughing the whole way through(at how pathetic the movie was!) PLEASE, DO NOT go see this movie!!!!!!"
1,PAINFUL to watch... Horrible overall except vocals,"I watched this movie while babysitting my nice, who is an americal idol fan,.. after the first 15 minutes, maybe earlier, it was becoming painful to watch.. the acting was TERRIBLE. and the dancing was cheesy.. the script/plot was poorly put together.This shouldnt have went to the movies, and should have went right to DVD.Unless you are a TRUE DIE HARD Justin or Kelly fan, I DON'T recommend this movie.I can say it is the worst I have ever seen."
2,I'm being generous because...,"of Kelly Clarkson's vocals in the movie. I actually bought it used just to check it out and get a good laugh. I got what I expected...lousy plot, lousy acting and scripted beach dance routines,and got a good laugh! However, I like Kelly Clarkson, and she's cute in this film, so I'm being nice. Not the worse movie of all time, but definitely one that I haven't watched again."
1,NO...Period.,"All I can say is, ""The things that happen when you forget to pack your cyanide pill."" This movie was quite possibly the worst movie ever made. The cast, along with the director and the producers should be hung for making this movie. I mean, who allowed for this movie to be made? I would also like to comment on the costumes for this movie. When was this movie made? 2003? Then why were they wearing clothes that weren't even cool in the 1960's? This movie was an abortion. My friend and I have a themed movie night that we call ""Torture Theater."" We found that this was an excellent choice for our monthly ""Torture Theater"" and believe me, we will never watch it again."
1,"AGHH AH, POOPY AHH!!!!","OUCH! WOw, this movie is reprehensible. Not only does this movie score as one of the worst things I've ever seen, but it also gave me one of the most painful bouts of diarrhea I have personally ever experienced. Whenever the image of Justin popped into my mind again, I'd get that familiar feeling and look desperately for the nearest bathroom, where i'd noisily relieve myself. Please spare yourself the pain I have gone through."
1,American Flops Again,"There was absolutely no doubt in my mind that when it really comes to movies, there really has to be a lot of chemistry within the works. It was just a shame that Kelly Clarkson was one of those who didn't have chemistry within her Thankful record, and it just goes even worse with From Justin To Kelly. If you're an American Idol fan, you'd surely love it, but it is the worst [...] I've ever had seen at the box office. I really thought the film could've showcased better chemistry between Justin and Kelly. Unfortunately, there wasn't any. If you really like these kind of teenage movie musicals, go get a copy of Grease with John Travolta. Trust me, you'll have a much better time seeing that 70's film instead."
1,$ to make this movie should have donated to a worthy cause!,NEGATIVE 1000 ZEROSAnyone who gives this movie a positive rating is Justin or kelly or a family member!!!This movie makes garbage appealingThe American judicial system could use this film and force criminals to watch it as a sentenceTalk about harsh justice
2,BEACH BLANKET IDOL,"For the most part, this film could have been a lot worse. It was a gimmick from the beginning and after two delays, it will now open in the heart of the Summer rush. Oddly enough, I actually enjoyed the movie itself more than the music. Kelly Clarkson deserved to win AMERICAN IDOL, but no one ever seems to give her a good song. Since it will be on video within three months, you might as well wait. This film is not worth paying for other than to keep the kiddies quiet for an hour and a half. There are indeed some funny moments, but the music provides too much of a distraction to give the film an even flow. God help us if there is a FROM CLAY TO RUBEN in our future!"
2,"Ok, an attempt","If you've seen The Real Cancun, and love spring break movies, DON'T SEE THIS ONE! Okay, I'll give credit to J&K's vocals(especially Kelly's well-done remake of 'Vacation') but this movie made no sense to me. The lines are cheap, and the dance moves look like a 3rd grader could've done them. But if you are a true Justin and Kelly fan, then this is a must-have for you guys!"
4,not bad...,"I've heard people saying that this movie is really really bad. So I went ahead and rent it with the lowest expectation. And I actually kinda like it. Well, it's kinda cheesy and the actings are not that good, but the songs, the whole musical thing is actually pretty good. I can't say that this is the best musical, but it's actually a good one.Kelly Clarkson's voice is definitely amazing! I wasn't a Justin fan during the whole AI thing, but I think he sings pretty good in here too."
1,HOLY COW!!,"Isn't it interesting how Hollywood continues to believe that the viewing audience is populated by mindless suckers who will unquestioningly buy off on actors who promote the premise that ""if I act I can sing"" or, in the case of FROM JUSTIN TO KELLY, ""if I sing I can act.""Kelly Clarkson and Justin Guarini star in a movie that should never have been made. No plot. No direction. Nonsense! And the favorable comparisons to classic films of similar genre starring duos like Ann-Margret and Bobby Rydell (BYE BYE BIRDIE), Frankie Avalon and Annette Funicello (BACK TO THE BEACH), and Deborah Walley and James Darren (GIDGET GOES HAWAIIAN) are absolutely irresponsible, if not idiotic.Pass on this one. While it is arguable as to whether these two can sing, it is unquestionable that neither can act.THE HORSEMAN"
4,For Justin and Kelly Fans,"This film wasn't 100% original or creative for that matter. However, It clearly wasn't made for the critics it was made for American Idol (Justin and Kelly) fans such as myself. I loved the music and the story was cute. However, If you arent a Justin or Kelly fan, don't waste your time. I loved it!"
4,"Would you believe, I actually SAW it? Got the DVD too.","From Justin to Kelly is not too bad for what it is. It can be seen as an attempt to update beach films of the 60s to the 21st century.A Grease remake it isn't. It's not even like Spiceworld, although it was made by the same folks. I have to admit that I enjoyed it,but I didn't come in the nearly deserted theatre expecting too much. The Vacation cover at the start seemed more like a karaoke performance, and it may had been better to license the Go Gos original. There was no soundtrack disc issued here nor was there any tracks from ""Thankful"" in the film. What Fox should have done was to either air this on Fox back in May as part of a expanded American Idol special or just bring it directly to DVD. using the 2001 theatres where FJTK was playing for a wide release of Bend it Like Beckham, which at the time I wrote this review had yet to play in many cities.Don't tell anyone, but I got the DVD."
1,How Could Anyone Watch this [...],"I consider this movie to be one of the worst movies of all time, two no talent hacks that have to start their music career through a reality t.v. show make a musical! What an awesome idea! I also like it because Justin lost, so he is the king of no talent hacks. These two can barely sing and then movie executives get the bright idea to try to make them act? I would actually consider this the first reality show movie besides The Real Cancun because I don't even consider that a real movie. The only reason I would possibly own this movie would be to be ironic but yet the ironic virtue of owning it would be overshadowed by its overall [...]"
4,"Cool Brazilian tunes, with a light, lyrical beat","Good Brazilian pop. Tic, Tic, Tac, the third song, was a huge dance hit in South America and somewhat in Europe."
5,Mountain life in isolation,"This book was recommended to me decades before I ever got to read it...Written in mountain dialect of the day,it brings the reader from a world of isolation to a new world that is astonishingly different. It was just as revealing to the mountaineer who ventured out as it was to those finding and exploring a new world in the Americas.I have bought several of these old books to give as gifts and have yet to find any recipients who had anything but a high opinion of the writer and the wonderful story she wrote."
4,Pretty good flashlight pouch/holster for cheap.,"I bought this for a Streamlight G2Z flashlight and it fit fine despite the fact that it's made for the Blackhawk Gladius. I couldn't find a flashlight pouch that was specifically made for the Streamlight G2Z except for the polymer ones, but I wanted a pouch make out of nylon so I bought this to try out and it worked out fine.The fit is snug without being too tight and it's fairly well made. The only complaints I have about it is that the button snap comes undone kind of easy, but I put some stick on velcro around the button to help it stay and now it works fine. What do you want for that price?"
4,"Good, but could be better","If any of you have CART World Series for PS1, don't expect anything from CART Fury. This is not a sim, it is nothing but arcade smashing and high flying. It only has 10 drivers, and every track is an oval, thats right, not a single course where you actually have to brake. But it is fun, and nice to have a CART racing game for PS2."
2,CART Fury Not Realistic,"I am a very loyal and devoted racing fan. I enjoy playing realistic simulation games such as NASCAR, F1, and Gran Turismo. I have been waiting for along time for Playstaion to come out with a CART Game. When I saw it I just had to get it and I figured it would be a cool simulation and realitic game...But I was WRONG!!! There is no realism in the game. The tracks aren't real and the drivers aren't up-to-date. You can't even race long races, you can only race a few laps.They need to re-think what they did to this game and they need to come out with a real CART game. They can use the NASCAR and F1 games for examples.The game that they put forth needs to be only meant for the Arcade. And in that since it would be okay because it does have good graphics.But, looking at it from a true racefan stand point...The game is far from real. If you're a true racefan looking for a simulation game, I suggest at the most to rent this game."
5,Really fun game that does require skill!,"Ok, here is the honest truth.....I actually bought this game twice and took it back both times, thinking that is was really cheesy and silly. But then a funny thing happened. I played it with my girlfriend and she loved it!! We had a lot of fun racing every car and every track. Then, even after she got sick of it.....I KEPT PLAYING IT. I found out that it DOES take a LOT of skill to keep lowering your record times. I raced the various tracks HUNDREDS of times...each time shaving off seconds at a time...sometimes only hundreths of a second...with every tiny little time decrease being a direct result of precisely how well I drove each lap. Eventually I had ALL of the top times on EVERY track! It is very very exciting when you set the top time, especially when you are breaking your own records slightly each time! Give this game a chance....when you race it over and over again you will see that it DOES take a LOT of skill!"
2,Glad I Bought it used!,"As far as racing games go, if you're REALLY bored then maybe it's worth the time to load into your PS2 (and wait for it to load). The simulation mode seems decent, with the ability to tweak your car though even that is limited. I was disappointed to find there was no pit stops. There are shortcuts, but I found them to only slow me down. The sub-games are fun, i.e. demolition. But whose idea was it to make a two sentance background music EVERY TIME the game loads? (sloooooowly) It was enough to make me want to strap m-80s to it and blow it to pieces. Do yourself a favor and turn the music(I use that term loosely) off. Would not recommend."
1,"""I wanted to give this game ZERO STARS""","Wow,I rented this game and I still fell like I was taken.The concept,the gameplay and the graphics were awful.I could not believe that CART alowed such a game to bear it's name in despite of a alrady lackluster image the racing league has and this game does not help to improve that image. I keep waiting for someone to make an open-wheel racing game that is in league with Gran Turismo,but it seems I will have to wait a little longer."
2,Where's the hairpin at Long Beach,"The circuits have been altered too much from their true form. For instance, Long Beach becomes almost an oval, without the haripin, tight first turn, etc. It didn't feel like I was there."
1,I'm glad I only rented it!!!,"While the positives for this game include CART licensing, real driver names and track modeled after the real thing, the negative far out weigh the positives in CART Fury. Many negative aspects include the load time - I spent more time waiting for the game to load than playing it, the cartoon like graphics, the lack of turns on the tracks - the real life track names are only modeled after the real thing and many do not come close. All of the tracks are almost perfect ovals with very little turning involved.And Finally the game play.While I am Gran Turismo pro, loosing only a race here and there, the race AI in this game is completely unrealistic. It is not uncommon in this game to fall behind to last place for the first couple of laps only to astonishingly go form last to first on the last lap of the race.To sum it up, this game is so bad, I am forced to even consider renting a NASCAR game. :("
5,Not just your average map!,"It gives you an up close view of Yosemite Valley mapped. No more squinting and turning your Yosemite park map every which way just to get a bird's eye view of the valley trails. Major trails are listed along with their milage. It even gives an adequate view of how the trails bend and curve, so you have a rough idea what to expect while out on your valley hikes. Included in the map is historical captions about some of the landmarks along with blk/wht and color photo snippets. There is even a basic park phone directory and a time line of historical events. This is a great magnified map made from a thick durable paper and easy to handle because of its smaller size, NO map folding FUSS! That's an A+ in itself. Just an overall great map to take along on your hikes."
5,Topographic View of Yosemite Valley -- A Winner!,"If you want a great bird's eye view of Yosemite Valley to orient yourself to the location or if you plan to hike around the Valley -- you want this map. It's plain, simple, to the point and gives you an up front idea of what the terrain is like in an oblique topographic view -- almost three-demensional.The other side of the map is filled with information about hikes and scenic wonders of Yosemite Valley. I'm sure Ansel Adams would have approved of this one for getting around the place! Fabulous supplement to the NPS guide.And if you want a broader view of Yosemite NP, National Geographic has a fabilous fold out map."
4,"Kiddy Songs, adult arrangements","These are the typical children's songs (though some with lyrics different than I remember); but the arrangements are not just rinky dink pianno, but guitars, differnt percussions, and unique arrangements. That allows the cd to play in our car without driving me nuts."
2,Disappointed,"The album is overall very poor. There's way too much reverb which make the songs sound very old and really dated. I actually bought this album because of Amado Mio, which is a quality song. This album falls far from Warm Leatherette and Nightclubbing. Amado Mio, Driving Satisfaction, and Bulletproof Heart are worth considering. I'm hopeful that her new album is better."
1,This album is horrible,"I bought this album because I had never heard a Grace Jones album and so I decided to buy this one. Big mistake! All of the songs are so poor and Grace cannot sing for anything. She doesn't even sing hardly- it's mostly her just yelling and talking! The only half-way decent song is a bonus track called Dream. Other than that, this album sucks."
2,A mixed bag,"I love Grace Jones and I bought this LP when it was first released. Later I replace it with a CD version of it. But honestly I only did it in order to keep my Grace Jones CD collection updated. And (again) honestly, this album was already a disappointment when it was released - and remains a disappointment.Why is it a disappointment? Because it only has two or three good (not great) songs glued together with some horribly produced tracks that look like rejected demos. They sound like plastic with all those synth clichés from the 80's. And many of them really seem to have been written for some other voice. It is weird that the amazing energy we find in Grace's previous albums is nowhere to be found here - except LOVE ON TOP OF LOVE and AMADO MIO that manage to rescue some of Grace's magic.It is no wonder that after such a disappointing album like this, Grace spent 19 years before the release of a new one.Sad, sad, sad."
2,An embarassment to somebody named Kellerman,"Two stories in one binding. Rerun of the old Ace paperback double novel marketing ploy. As pot-boilers go, it is better than average. Two police procedurals, each with lots of local color. The blubs say they were both written jointly by this husband and wife, but the stories are so similar and one is so much better witten than the other, that one of the two authors should be hiding in shame."
3,one half plus one half does not equal one,"In that I am not sure why the Kellermans wrote this particular book, it may be, in their eyes, a successful change of pace. For me, it was somewhat disappointing and not reflective of the psychological and literary gifts found in their other writings. The stories had a lot of potential but lacked the focus and punch of a short story and the character development of a novel. Change can be good ~ it will be interesting to see if this is evolutionary or simply a mutation."
1,Surprise endings,"If you're in a hurry, just read the last chapter in each of these novellas, because all the other chapters waste your time wondering how the suspects could have committed the crimes, then, Lo and Behold! ""Out of the woodwork"" comes the guilty party who wasn't even considered up until the last 10-15 pages."
2,Disappointing....,"Jonathan Kellerman is one of my favorite authors...I have read all of his work. This was a complete disappointment! If this is your first JONATHAN Kellerman read--Please buy one of his earlier works. The ""Santa Fe"" story was the worst, the ending just left me hanging and wondering what has happened here..? The ""Boston"" story was a bit better but not much. I would say, skip this one, Mr. Kellerman has much better work out there.RD"
2,"Favorite authors, where have you gone?","Every author has a style. I feel both Jonathan and Faye have deviated from theirs in these novellas. The characters had a roughness about them, they were not the well spoken, educated characters we have grown to love with Alex and Milo, Peter, Rina and Cynthia. I think each story would have been much better given a full novel format to develop the characters and plot lines. By far, the ""Boston"" portion was the better of the two in my opinion. When I first heard that the Kellermans were going to work together, I expected a blending of style and characters, possibly another character line that the world would grow to love and rush out to by the latest release. Please, Jonathan and Faye - you are both truly talented authors - don't minimize the talents into short stories!"
1,What a waste of time! Doesn't deserve even 1 star.,"I have read all of the Delaware books, enjoyed them, but this is one of the worst books I have ever waded through. I've never cared for Faye's books, so didn't even start her half. But Jonathan should be ashamed to put his name to this. A ten year old could do better. I can't understand why he would do something like this. Surely he doesn't need the money!"
2,Flaccid and uninspired!,"&#65279;Kellerman usually delivers a tightly wound mystery thriller with a psychological edge. This onebarely makes it off the ground. The story was adequate as were the characters, but lacked punch.The story by his wife is a little better but spoiled by a sudden and somewhat jarring ending."
3,good & bad,"I really don't know, but I'd say that Jonathan wrote the Boston side and that Faye wrote the Sante Fe half. The Boston story is interesting. I didn't make it past the first few pages of the Sante Fe story. Here's why:In the first two pages - ""Darrell Two Moons"", ""Cafe Karma"", ""Eden-Yield Oraganic Lamb Plus Eclectic Veggie Burrito"", ""Quilted black ski jacket"", ""X-harnessed cowhide shoulder holster"", ""Custom stitched elephant-hide Tony Lama"", ""Fuzzy brown and white plaid Pendleton shirt"", ""Green Tead Chai Latte""...honestly, that is really in the first two pages.Is this product placement or just really, really bad prose?"
1,Very weak effort by both,I am a big fan of Jonathan Kellerman's work and have read them all. This was a real disappointment. The plot of both short stories was as thin as the book. Nearing the end of each I thought to myself -- why do I care what happens? Not a good sign for this type of book. Glad I got it from the library and did not part with real money for this effort.
2,DISAPPOINTED FAN,"Jonathan and Faye Kellerman are two of my favorite authors ... have been for many years. I was looking forward to this collaboration. I received an advanced copy and could barely get through it. The characters were cardboard cut-outs, the plots plodded along, the endings were let-downs. Hope the Kellermans stick to what they do best in the future - - collaborate at home and work separately."
3,A Bit Thin for Hardcover,"This was another Christmas present and as such, I enjoyed reading the two novellas done by the Kellermans. The book is easily read in a day. I started with the homicide set in Santa Fe and was finding it interesting until the end arrived. And that is about the way it happened. Not much explanation - some questions left hanging. I liked the relationship of the two police officers and their characters were well drawn. It was almost as though this was intended to be a full blown novel, but the author(s) ran out of steam and decided to pull the plug in the way that they did.The Boston homicide story was clearly the better of the two, yet I thought that it also could have been drawn into a larger story if the authors had chosen to do so.So, if you are looking for a couple of plesant little stories about homicide and have a plane ride to take or some time to curl up by the fire, I would suggest you wait for the paperback. It should be right along."
1,Why Did I Read This??,"Let me start by saying that I am a very big fan of both Faye and Jonathan Kellerman's previous work. I was very excited to read a novel that was written by both authors, however after the end of the first novella, I struggled through the second. At the end of the entire book I felt as though each story was writen for the sake of a deadline and not with a reader in mind. I was hoping that the two novellas were somehow releated, but I never felt that they were - and perhaps this is the issue with the book in total."
3,Entertaining,I enjoyed this book but it was not as good as most of theirs. They are two of my favorite writers but thisbook fell short of my usual interest
3,Two Mystery Novellas,"This is actually two books in one. A collection (if 2 is a collection?) of mystery stories by a husband and wife.The first story by Faye Kellerman, dealing with the slaying of a college basketball star in Boston, is the stronger of the two. Detective Dorothy Parker and her family are a compelling portrait of a working class Black family in Boston. Of the two, this is a 3&1/2 star story.The second story, by husband Jonathan, is set in Santa Fe, dealing with the murder of a local gallery owner. The portrait of ex NYPD detective Katz and his Native American partner isn't as interesting, but the story is at least adequate.Overall the book(s) won't be disappointing."
1,Borreeing,"I cannot believe the kellermans wrote this, their books are usually spellbinding, I can't put them down,where's the rest of the stories."
1,Agree - Waste of Time,I am a fan of both kellermans but this collaboration was a big disappointment. I think maybe they were trying to do a twist ending but the twists involved people you didn't care about so there was no point. The only positive I can say is that I didn't pay more than a dollar or two for this book.
3,A hit and a miss,"The strength of Jonathon and Faye Kellerman's writing is in the meticulous development of plot and characters. Unfortunately these two novellas do not give them a proper forum in which do do what they do best. The Boston story is the better of the two and deals with the death of a talented college basketball player. From among the characters in this story, the detective named Dorothy, who is the single mother of a large brood of growing kids, is interesting and worth developing. The Santa Fe story deals with the death of an obnoxious art dealer and neither the character nor the plot inspire much interest. This book illustrates the attractiveness of developing characters such as Alex Delaware, Rina Lazarus and Peter Decker over several novels in a series."
3,"My favorite authors, not my favorite book","11/15/2004Short and to the point is the best way to describe ""Double Homicide."" These two stories are, at best, really novellas with local color thrown in much as one would use walnuts and chocolate chips in a cookie. Cute packaging conveys the notion that readers have a double portion of these authors - the Boston story is physically typeset one way and the Santa Fe story is set the other. There are even two different pictures of the authors together on each jacket flap. In my humble opinion, two authors who are intelligent and diligent at their craft could have done better for their first time publishing together."
2,DVD came chipped and scratched - low quality.,"I ordered this for Christmas for my husband who happens to love the Las Vegas series. The low rating isn't from the TV show itself (as he really does like it), it's that the DVD came scratched and chipped and the actual shows were not HD but really low quality. I couldn't find all 5 seasons together so unfortunately had to purchase separately - I'd make sure you're buying a good version!"
1,Television Porn.....,"The amount of suggestive content in this series, is enough to make one think that it should be rated NC-17. And it would be rated R for Rotten acting."
1,Returned,"Product received was purchased used, and was damaged. Product was returned, and a new one has not been purchased since."
2,Uncut? No...,"""Uncut and uncensored""...except for the original music. This is becoming far too common with TV to DVD sets. It's a good show, but once again, I will not buy TV shows on DVD that are not the original TV broadcasts. Tell the studios enough it enough already. Skip this one and buy ""Firefly"" instead."
1,Uncensored?,You mean this was also filmed using language not permitted on broadcast tv? That seems quite doubtful. Someone needs to prove this to be true else this is complete false advertising!
5,Compelling,I think that one word sums it all up. I never saw the show before until I ordered the DVD and I was pleasently surprised. The charecters are great. The technology is unbelievable. I have not one bad word to say about this series. Very enjoyable.
2,It's no excuse!...,"The show is nice to watch but this season isn't really that good compared to the rest of the series.Anyways I'm so sick of people giving excuses for those lazy soundtrack changes! I mean,it's the box set I will have my entire life and it's not even identical to the real version (the TV one),so I'm sorry to say that but I feel cheated,even worse,stolen,as I paid for this fake.A fake Gucci purse will never be a real one,even if there's Gucci written on it."
3,thanks for the sell... but,"thank you for the season, but the last disc on the set on side b doesnt play at all. like it's frozen right before the las vegas dvd menu pops up. so i cant watch the third disc side b at all and i've tried two different dvd players. but all the other discs work like a champ."
2,Dissapointed,"I bought this series as a gift and it was supposed to be brand new and did have the plastic around it, but the dvd's are scratched and can't even be watched. I am very dissapointed that the movies can't even be enjoyed."
4,Great Series,"After watching these episodes. I'm sorry that I never got to see any when they were on tv. But the show is great. I really got into it. My only complaint is that, I felt a few episodes lagged a little. Hence the four stars. But It's actually four and a half stars. Because it was a minor complaint. Maybe I can catch some of the next season. Or, get it on dvd. It was a plus being uncut and uncensored. Not like when it was on tv."
4,"Great, but not the best.","Pretty decent show. An excellent opening for the series sets a great mood for a good pilot but a few episodes throughout the year seem a bit weak. The anamorphic transfers are decent, better then most TV shows to DVD but still look a bit soft. There is certainly a lot of eye candy in the ways of people and scenery with some cameos from a few lame celebrities. Overall, more entertaining then most of the junk on TV.Now if only I could remember the name of the song played over the Main Menu screen..."
5,Chemistry of this show,"I am definitely a Las Vegas show fan. I normally don't watch many TV series shows at all. Most series come and go without me seeing a single episode. I started watching this one by accident and have now watched most every one (through renting them as I never seemed to be able to be consistent at watching it on TV regularly). The chemistry between characters stood out to me and it was one of the things that attracted me to it. I just don't see chemistry between characters like that very much at all and it's quite refreshing to watch. The show was very well done and entertaining and ranks up there with the best series I have seen to date. I was so bummed it got cancelled, it was one of a kind and I will surely miss it."
4,Where the heck is Elvis?,"The series is still just great, picture and soundquality are quite well, but the different title theme really hurts.Somehow its not the same feeling watching the series without the king in the beginning.Personally I don't mind few bonus material and doublesided dvd's, so the different theme is the only reason for not giving it 5 stars."
5,Jackpot! Hitting the Vegas Strip Never Was This Fun!,"Wow! A glitzy prime time soaper for men! Who would have thought? A great cast, led by James Caan, sparkles the Vegas strip with the high rollin' lives of the staff at the Montecito. The DVDs feature uncut versions of the episodes, which would be too hot for TV. Lots of action and sexy situations to keep a guy watching. Not a well rounded show, and certainly not family viewing, but it is a guilty pleasure for me. Almost like a male version of ""Dynasty."" Lots of purty girls, rounghneckin' fights, and gamblin'!!! Popcorn entertainment. Don't ask why do I watch it, just watch and enjoy. It's like a free trip to Vegas every time."
3,CC or subtitle???,Season Two has subtitles (English) but there is nothing saying that Season One has them.Please - if you have this season (One) let me know if there are subtitles or CC.Thanks
2,"Not quite Bottom of the Barrel, but...","As with other reviews, I found only the first half of the book intriguing. The story degenerates into fewer character interactions that make sense and more plot-driven conveniences and complications that ultimately require a staggeringly anticlimactic explanation of the previous goings-ons.Can't recommend it."
2,Only okay.,"I kept trying to view it in context of the period. It does takes one back to a time before computers and cell phones when detectives worked occasionally on bribes and intimidation, but also on instinct and legwork. However, many of the conclusions reached by Lam are a bit hard to believe, and most of the characters are over the top. However, it is a detective story in the classic sense, and a black-and-white movie fun read."
5,Great timeless rock,"This is a very solid album. The songs were, to say the least ahead of their time. My band had the chance to open for these guys back in the winter of '89. Watching their lead singer jump off stage, grab a chair and stand on it while he delivered his dialogue during the songs were a sight to see. I just wished they could have captured the live show. It could have been their KISS ""Alive"" turning point but at that time every label gave you at most two shots and out due to the huge explosion of college alt rock. They weren't an indie band since they were on Geffen records but a pure rock band that wanted to share their story with the masses even if it did take eight minutes to tell it in a song. Great disc, I highly recommend it to you."
2,slightly misled,"it was billed as the retail issue, but was not. seller was unwilling to renegotiate so i just shipped it back without even playing it. sorry about the long delay in the review, must've missed the email. was reimbursed in almost a timely fasion due to amazon i'm sure."
3,Barely Alright,"As a new fan of this sexy cowboy, I was eager to buy ""Alright Guy"" after falling in love with ""Smoke Rings in the Dark"". I was unfortunately quite disappointed with this effort. The only reason I gave it three stars is because the album is so well-produced and the music is still pretty good. The songwriting however is terrible, and the title track of the album is downright stupid. I'm really not sure who the intended audience for the this album was - but it sure wasn't the droves of fans who bought the previous album. ""Smoke Rings..."" has found a home in my CD player, this album however has not. A very disappointed listener."
3,Too bad this came after 'Smoke Rings',"Or else I might give it 4 stars. This just doesn't quite stack up because of the quality of songs here. You get 6 KILLER songs (tracks 1, 3, 5, 8, 9, 11), and the other 5 I'd give a lump grade of C-. It's not the performance or the musicianship, it's just the song choice. This is worth buying if you dig the singles, love Gary or want to take a break from cookie cutter neu-country... but a warning to those who loved the singles,: there are some edgy numbers here and some randy language."
1,Not much to this one.,"While Gary has triumphed in the past with Smoke Rings In The Dark, this effort falls very flat. Seems he is trying to be the rugid, tough guy with a sensitive side. Too much emphasis on either. Get back to the honky tonk and leave this smaltz behind. One stand-out song is ""Devil's Candy"" but most others, especially ""The One"" just kinda lay there."
2,Give me a break!,If you like tough guy country this is it to buy for 2001. Hearing my first Gary Allan cd I was not very impressed at all there was to much tough guy rubbish and and alot of the songs lacked emotion. Allan does not sing like George Strait and Garth Brooks people call him not your usual nashville performer Gary Allan is not a bad performer at all but his cd's he should get a little more softer with his music and stay away from stuff like Man of me and Alright Guy. That was my opinion of this cd not impressed but it was not disgraceful niether go back to music like in Smoke Rings in the dark.
4,Gary Allan - Alright Guy,"I have to say I would recomend this CD to any country fan, or any Gary Allan Fan. Being that this is his fourth album, he definitely shows he knows what he is doing and he does it well. The best tracks in my opinion are catchy Man of Me, touching Man to Man, naughty The Devils Candy, the romantic Adobe Walls, and the ""regular"" guy in Alright Guy! This album has something for everyone, as all the tracks are a little bit different and really show a classy style, much different than his previous three albums. I only give this album 4 of 5 stars, because Smoke Rings in The Dark is his best CD out of his four releases.Go and buy it today!"
4,Another Solid Album,"This one is full of songs that will probably never get played on your corporate country station. That's too bad because this is an album that really hits on all cylinders. Gary Allan picks up the promise of ""Smoke Rings In The Dark"" and brings it all home."
3,Gary Allan is alright indeed,"Gary Allan's first album of the new millenium, Alright Guy, adds several more hits to his growing resume. Gary shows the full spectrum of his amazing voice, throwing accusations in ""Man to Man"", making propositions to a spanish waitress in ""Adobe Walls"", and proving he's a good man in ""Alright Guy"". While not as searingly hot as his previous release (Smoke Rings In The Dark), this album still deserves recognition and praise."
3,Do yourself a favor and check out Todd Snider,"While I think it's pretty questionable to name your album after someone else's song, which you precede to butcher on the album - overall this CD is just OK.If you even half-like the title track, ""Alright Guy"" please direct yourself to Todd Snider's excellent album ""Songs for the Daily Planet"" which features teh original, and superior, version of ""Alright Guy."" That plus an overall stellar collection of songs - as opposed to this one which is mostly filler riding on the strength someone else's song."
1,What Willie Wouldn't Do,"Gary Allen asks, ""What would Willie do?"" One thing I think he wouldn't do would be to record a CD like this.I'm glad that so many other people seem to have liked this CD, but I found it very disappointing. Gary Allen has been billed as a ""country music traditionalist,"" but calling this music ""traditional country"" is kind of like calling Rod Steward ""hard rock.""If you like the ""hot young country"" which is coming out of Nashville these days, you will probably like this CD. If you are expecting anything different, you will probably be disappointed."
1,Alright guy?,"If you wanna hear an alright guy, check out Todd Snider, who wrote the track and played it 100 times better (IMHO). I think it's bare-faced cheek of this guy not only to do a bad cover of Todd's song but also use the name as the album title. I do not think he is an alright guy (musically speaking). I think he's just one more of these guys who think if they wear a cowboy hat and play ""radio-friendly"" music (pap), they'll make it big. Unfortunately, he may be right. Garth Brooks anyone? Do me a favour! There is so much good stuff out there, why waste your money on this? Buy Todd Snider instead, or John Prine, or Steve Earle, or Guy Clark, or..."
5,Not your average country music artist!,"Gary Allan just isn't your typical country music artist, so don't expect to hear typical!Love his music and haven't been disappointed in one single album yet!"
4,nice license cover,This is a very sturdy and nice licence plate cover.It looks very cool on the Jag!I would definitely recommend.
4,Good not great,Mine is on a '04 XJ8. Looks great but obscures a part of the number. I also dislike the way the top-only fastening leaves the base a bit proud of the body.. I'll look for an alternative
2,Poor design,"The problem is that there is no slots for the lower part of your licence plate to slide into, therefore when you tighten the top fasteners it sticks out from the plate. If you loosen it up then it rattles. It looks good, but I am looking for another."
3,Does not wear well over time.,"After two years, the frame developed significant pot marks (I live in a climate that has a lot of salt on the roads during winter - might explain.). Also, check with your local police or inspection station. I was forced to remove it because it covered up certain sections of the plate. It is very pretty though and, at this price, you can afford to replace it every couple of years."
5,Just LOVE the jaguar plate frames!,"Beautiful product! Very strong and substantive. As others have said, a lower bolt opening would make it a bit more secure on our cars. But that doesn't really detract from the plate frame. The jaguar is gorgeous!"
2,Not for me...,"""Beguiled"" tells the story of Raquel who loses her job and decides to go dancing at a Miami nightclub ?!? I guess she wants to dance her troubles away. Instead she ends up being swept into a totally unrealistic adventure that drifts from the Caribbean to Central America. This story includes Snoe's trademark foray into otherworldly, magical scenarios. All in all just not my cup of tea..."
5,The best and my introction to this genre.,"I loved this book so much I had to purchase it again. Foolishly I loaned out my autographed copy to a family member who has misplaced it. After nagging for years for its return, I bought another copy to revisit. I fell in love all over again. My only regret is that it is not an autographed copy. I'll never make that mistake again."
4,Por que Antonio Por que.,"This movie is very dark, Victoria Abril is a prostitute that is also part of the revolution in spain. Antonio Banderas is the rebel leader, this story has many twist that I won't ruin for you, but you should know that There is alot of nudity and violence. And Victoria is quite pregnant during several brutal sex scenes. Again this movie is a very dark look at war and what it does to people. One final note, it is in spanish with subtitles."
3,Silliness,"I needed to sign in, so I clicked on this, knowing it would make me sign in first. The book is necisary for you to bridge to Senior Girl Scouts, and I don't have it. That's why I'm looking for it on the internet."
2,Too heavy,"We purchased this Graco seat for our second child after being very happy with another Graco infant seat for our first child over 6 years ago. It is considerably larger - length, width, and weight than the previous SafeSeat styles. Our baby fit in it well, but my husband and I both struggled with the weight of the combined baby and carseat by the time our son was 8 months old. Because of this, we switched over to a convertible seat at 9 months, making the extra $$ we paid for the large size worthless. Keep this in mind if you foresee carrying/transporting your baby around a lot. This is a very heavy car seat."
2,Color is great,"I bought this because I thought it had rated the best in a consumer's report article, and I loved the color. The straps are sometimes hard to work--they stick at times. Also, using this as part of the travel system with the stroller is a pain. It's not very sturdy and is sometimes difficult to release. The release is also sometimes problematic in the car base. The handle configuration is not easy on the back, esp. with a growing baby. The visor often falls down behind/under the carseat, which makes it a pain when transporting. I sometimes pull them off altogether to not be bothered with them."
2,"Awkward, Heavy, Where's the Slack?","I bought this car seat based upon the written reviews here. Well, after having baby and working with this super-wide car seat, you quickly realize your walking is limited to about 10 steps. Now my baby is four days short of 5 months old and over 20 lbs. (! I know! Huge!) and together, this car seat and baby are approaching 40 lbs! I can barely lift it into my car, and cannot maneuver it at all. I am now moving him out of it and straight into a Britax Marathon and giving up on the ""systems."" Also, I did move the straps on the Graco to the middle level and they are getting tight on junior, and I moved them to the top level and there is NO SLACK whatsoever - I almost cannot buckle in a 5-month old baby."
5,"so far, so good!",so far so good...only complaint is that it is a bit difficult to unsnap out of base and seat belt buckle can be a bit difficult too...but i guess that means it is all secure. great car seat overall!
4,So cute!,We didn't know the gender of our baby and wanted something generic. This car seat is SOOOO much cuter then the picture shows. I love it. It's a little heaver then some - but it's designed to fit a bigger baby (up to 12 months) then the lighter ones. SO if you want lighter - buy a lighter one. If you want one that will fit your baby longer and weighs a little more - this is the car seat for you. It's awesome. We LOVE this carseat and are so glad we bought it!
4,Does the job but could be improved further,Pros:Extra size and weight supportEase of useLittle guy seems to be comfortable during the driveCons:Have to be a little careful when the clip-in portion (which is made of metal)is released.Little on the unwieldy side and needs the front seat on a mid-sized sedan (Honda Civic 2007) to be pushed well up front in order for the baby seat to fit in the back.Some options such as loosening the straps not very intuitive
2,Takes up WAY TOO MUCH SPACE!,"I can't stand this car seat because it takes up way too much front to back space on the car seat. In order to fit it into our Chrysler 300M we had to put it on the rear right side seat and move the passenger seat all the way forward! Our car has quite a bit of space in the back seats, but this car seat takes up way more than it should.You also have only one slot for the front buckle that goes between the baby's legs, so it's not adjustable in that sense.The mesh cover is nice and soft though :)"
4,Great seat!,"We purchased this seat because we needed to replace an expired hand-me-down. The roomier size appealed to us, as our daughter is in the 90th percentile for height at 5 months of age. I have one minor complaint- I have trouble getting the clip across her chest undone at times. You need to really squeeze the plastic to get it to budge- a bit of a pain if you have a fussy baby. Otherwise, the seat is easy to use and she seems quite comfortable."
3,Very heavy and straps get stuck,"My baby is in 90+ percentile and I liked the idea of a longer lasting car seat. However, with my 4 months old, 16 lb baby boy now, it is very heavy and uncomfortable to carry him around in this carrier. I am a female that used to strength train and lift weights, but I'm still strugling with it. The straps get stuck all the time. It is very annoying, especially when baby cries and you can't get him out. My husband just gave up on it. I'm thinking about switching to a convertable car seat."
3,"Pretty good, but too snug","My daughter has used this car seat about 10-20 times in her first six months, as we live in New York and use a car infrequently for longer out-of-town trips. It was fine for the first month or two, but our daughter is pretty big, and soon it became too tight for her. The shoulder straps are very difficult to figure out, and appear not to expand too much, so once your child is 15-20 pounds, it can be very difficult for her to fit comfortably. Aside from the size issue, it's very comfortable and soft, with a nice canopy. It's not too heavy, but feels very safe. And, we have had no trouble fitting it in mid-size cars."
4,nice,IT'S A good carseat. But I find it pretty heavy and we're having trouble getting it to fit right in our car.
4,Safety is key,My wife and I ordered this car seat because of its outstanding safety rating. This seat is light weight and easy to install. The seat has a wide range for adjusting the tilt in order to make sure that the seat is at the correct angle.
4,Awesome Seat!,"I bought a version (different colors) of this seat for my newborn twins. I like that the base has a level to let you it is installed properly and that when you drop the seat into the base, it makes a very secure CLICK to let you know it's properly connected.What I didn't like was the weight. You see those moms running around carrying their carseats instead of putting them on the strollers...and I'm betting you'll never see them with this one! It's super heavy but it was a small price to pay for the feeling of security these seats brought.I also wasn't impressed at what a chore it was to wash the fabric. Dismantling the straps was a big pain but the fabric washed very nicely, didn't stain, and looked brand new the entire time I used them.I'd definately recommend them!"
4,"The Soulful House Expereince, Vol. 2: Gospel House","This one is a keeper.I found this Gospel House to be very inspirational as well as up beat.The upbeat tempos will definitely get you up in morning and place you on natural high. I absolutely love it.Signed,House Head 4 Life"
1,Not uplifting at all,"Not into techno or rave music which is what this CD is. Yes, the tracks have a gospel flair and I hope God doesn't get offended."
4,Good collection of holiday classics,"Though it is billed as the soundtrack to the video Elmo Saves Christmas, this title predominantly features holiday classics rather than music from the movie. (I purchased it thinking it would include songs like ""Every Day Can't Be Christmas,"" but found that that song and some others are not on the album.)Despite this, if your little listeners are Sesame Street fans, they will enjoy this album, which features favorite characters singing such songs as ""Here Comes Santa Claus"" and ""Let It Snow."""
3,"Perfect for a short scale bass, otherwise like every other gig bag","Cheaply made, but zippers seem durable. Theres no real 'extra padding' for the head stock. Front pouch, is very small, not very deep. Perfect length for a short scale bass. Fits my Fender Squire SS like a glove... A very thin, wont survive any kind of serious fall, cheaply made glove. But hey ITS A $30 GIG BAG. Honestly I only bought it to occasionally take my bass out of my house. I also like the fact that I don't have another huge hardshell case taking up room. Buy it for function ONLY.Also has a very annoying squeak from the bass rubbing on the internal lining when you are walking and its slung over your shoulder. But I challenge you to find a decent gig bag for under $100."
3,Not Bad Not Good,It's one of those 3am type flicks when nothing else is on in the days before cable and satellite TV.
3,"Funny, Corny and Low-Budget","Anything associated with Master P is gonna be either corny, low-budget or both! Katt was very disappointing in this movie, thank goodness for Michael Blackson."
3,History of the Space Shuttle,"Very disappointed, some stuff was real good. Full video of memorial for both Shuttle crews and video inside Columbia right before break up. Lot's missing, in fact it jumps right from Challenger to Columbia with nothing on the mission in between. Zero on Hubble depolyment or the reapair mission to save it. Can't real call it History of the Space Shuttle without those missions. Nothing on the mission that first tested the MMU, some stuff of Sally Ride and her mission as the first US woman in Space. Over all I rate the Box set History of the Space Shuttle as a C-. If you want it try to get used as cheap as possible."
2,Not recommended,"This 5 disc set contains mostly recycled NASA footage many collectors will already have, and the footage is not even re-mastered but direct video transfer (which leads to poor quality in a lot of cases). Add to that a lot of inaccurate information or inappropriate footage (saying the X-24B was the first powered lifting body and showing the X-24A). Like a lot of cheap productions they rely on footage in the public domain, sparse (often inaccurate) facts and not much else. Not bad for kids but not recommended for any serious space enthusiast."
3,Good book but no enough,"This is a great book, but not enough for the test unless you have significant experience with FW-1."
1,"first time author, rushing book to market....","I've been using the 'exam cram' series for over three years... and yeah some titles are better than others, but this one makes me so upset I had to write a review (first time). Basic English comprehension should be a requirement for a person to be published... Maybe it's just me but what would you derive for this sentence... chapter 2, page 18... ""How the firewall ultimately handles data is based on the firewall's ability to properly handle the data."" Picky... maybe, but I just received this book and I love the premise of the 'exam cram's, 'just the facts baby', but it seems to me that the quality of their books is deteriorating. I just passed my CCIE written and that `exam cram' was a joke, very very poor, hence a 'second addition' June 2002. Maybe Mr. Piltzecker needs to start on the second addition of this book."
2,Disappointed,"I was disappointed in this book. I didn't find it as useful as I hoped, and I do not use it as I plan the bar mitzvah."
3,Planning organizer,"This is a big planning organizer that you use to write in. If you are looking for a party planning bood this is not it. I am using it in conjunction with the""party"" books."
2,There are better books available,"This book is basically a party planner. It was probably useful before so many people were proficient with computer spreadsheets, like Excel. It provides space for lots of lists, which now would be much easier to keep on computer. Basically, technology has made this book obsolete.There are descriptions of what to look for in a photographer, caterer, etc but they are pretty basic.The one useful part of the book is a simple ""countdown"" calender - ""Countdown to the Big Day,"" which lists all the major activities to be completed prior to the bar mitzvah.I think you could do better with other books that cover the party AND the ""mitzvah"" aspects of a bar mitzvah."
1,Bait and Switch with Lame Replacement,"Watch out. What I received was a regular 4GB USB 2.0 flash drive. It doesn't even look like the one pictured. Since I am not the first reviewer to experience this inadequate substitution, I am guessing that they have just run out of the U3s.This is especially disappointing having paid for Amazon Prime - thanks, Amazon, for the speedy delivery of the wrong item and, now, wasting my time to make the return. Anything else I can do for you while I'm up?"
5,Great Quality and very useful tray,I've purchased this set as a complement for a book I've purchased for my daughter.Glass Bead Jewelry Designs Book w/ POPThe beads are glass beads of great quality and the wooden tray keep them organize. Very good product for any bead lover.
5,Well done!,"I am not a professional fire-eater, but now feel confident using the techniques in this book. The author is clear and informative and gets right to the point. Highly recommended."
2,Very Basic Information,"This book outlines the basics of fire-eating. Essentially, the instructions read: light torch, open mouth, extinguish torch. Although tricks are explained, they are not very clear and do not list many tips. A beginner must learn through trial and error (!). Torches, fuels, and stunts are outlined briefly but without any serious clarity, and left me uncertain of how to proceed. This is the only tutorial available, unfortunately. It, for all its faults, did teach me to eat fire. I do not endorse or recommend fire-eating in any manner."
4,awesomeeeee,"its a great rod overall, but when it was opened in packagein the item was alittle bit dirty and some of the stickers faded the reel also didn't align with the bottom guide ring but other than that this rod is fairly priced for this quality of rodoverall i'm pretty happy/glad of my purchase and i would recommend other people to purchase this item"
4,Great fishing rod,I bought my fishing rod about a month a go and this thing is great. I am a beginner fisher and I love. It's not too complicated but sophisticated enough to get ready for a better one. The only thing I don't really like about this rod is that it's huge it's 7ft i have to collapse it in order to fit it in my car. I suggest people get a smaller size to avoid having to take it apart just to put it in and out of my car. I love it though.
5,Excellent paring knife,I received this paring knife after sampling and handling Wusthof Classic and a variety of J.A. Henkel knives. The Mercer has a different gripping (a special polymer rubber) which feels perfect in your hand and gives absolutely nothing up to either the Wusthof or the Henkel. Most culinary schools and many chefs swear by these. Highly recommended.
5,great little knife,"My son gave me this knife because he knows I like paring kives. I managed to lose or seriously misplace the knife. I was so disappointed. My son did not remember where he had purchased it. I looked in many stores, to no avail. Then I thought that I would try the Internet...Amazon...I buy books a lot. I was thrilled to find the knife and have it delivered swiftly. For a 77 year old woman it was a little victory! Great little knife!"
3,Nice knife but not as pictured,"It's a pretty good knife. However, it is not like the picture. The blade does not flare out to match the width of the handle like more expensive knives. It has a constant width that just sticks of the handle. I wanted a knife with a flared-out blade for easier cleaning, so I am disappointed."
3,"""A""-sides & ""B""-sides--but with irritations!","EMI had the admittedly cool idea of collecting both sides of Rick Nelson's 1st 10 singles on one disc. So why did they blow it in so many ways? The CD is missing ""Don't Leave Me ""b""-side of ""Poor Little Fool""); they inexplicably included previously-unreleased ""alternate takes"" of ""Never Be Anyone Else But You"" and ""Sweeter Than You"" (instead of the originals); and they tacked on ""Milk Cow Blues"" (the ""b""-side of ""You Are The Only One"", which appears on Vol.2!). But WORST of all, whatever possessed them to include studio ""out-takes"" at the start of ""Be-Bop Baby"" and ""It's Late""? I can't believe ANYONE really wanted to hear these, and they ruin the songs(thus necessitating getting other CDs to be able to hear them without these ""interruptions""). At least they've learned: when they released the 25th Ann. Ed. of Deep Purple's IN ROCK, the included ""out-takes"" were given separate tracks, which you could program your CD player to skip over if you wanted."
5,A delectable addition to anyone's cookbook collection!,"This book is a beautiful collection of the most heart-warming stories to accompany the most delicious recipes. Ms. Nathan has successfully captured the hodgepodge that is America today, with recipes from Moo Shu to Apple Pie. I can personally vouch for the deliciousness of the Apple Torte featured on the cover, as well as the incredible Stuffed Grape Leaves. This is a cookbook that you'll find yourself coming back to again and again. For the novice as well as the expert, this book has fabulous recipes for entertaining as well as those 'homey' ones that you'll find yourself making over and over again. My copy is less than one month old and already the pages are dog-earred and stained -- the sign of a GREAT cookbook!"
4,"Glad it's on CD, but.. the name?","This may be Michael Martin Murphey's finest album. I do believe Cowboy Songs (1) is a close second. This album was done a few years before Murphey began his series of Western music albums,and it's an extremely entertaining one. From the tender Innocent Hearts to the tongue in cheek and slightly cynical Ghost Town, this is a fine effort by Murphey. But, putting aside the very good music inside, let me ask the same question the other reviewers of this CD have posed....why couldn't Wounded Bird get Murphey's name right? When a company is preparing an album's re-release on CD, don't they use the image of the original vinyl album? I'm quite sure they do, after all, Wounded Bird got the photos right.And another funny thing...the credits on the inside spell his name Murphey...with an E. Oh well, the name is wrong, but the music is just right."
5,Take a Journey Home,"This CD is stunning. I have listened to and used many new consciousness style music CD's over the years but this one amazes me. I have used it for my personal meditation and for clients in my healing practice. Each time I have played it for someone the first time, I told them nothing about the music or the tunings used in it. Each time the listener used similar words to describe their experiences. Words like..""I felt my heart opening."" ""I felt like I had traveled to a strange yet familiar place"" ""this sounds like my heart if it were set to music."" These people had inner visions and messages and profoundly peaceful healing experiences. As a healer and a journey taker I highly recommend this journey to you."
5,"amazing, unique, beautiful","It's one of those little known but very important facts that music that is harmonious in the ancient sense no longer exists in our society. This is due to the way modern instruments are tuned - musicians have to be able to jump from key to key, and so the ancient harmonies have been subtly broken and forgotten. Along comes Fred Cameron and takes us not just back to the days before modern equal temperment tuning (about 200 years) but back to a method of tuning that dates back thousands of years, to ancient Mesopotamia. The results are very beautiful and very unique - there is just nothing else like it. I'd personally like to see more musicians, who are usually an experimental and open-minded bunch, try the ancient harmonious tuning systems. The differences are quite amazing."
5,"Refreshing look at the rise, fall, rebound of companies","This is an excellent, pragmatic, and thoroughly engaging book on how successful companies can find themselves at risk for failure due to what Sull coins as ""active inertia"". This concept is illustrated with a great set of corporate examples which are different from the ones used in many other business texts -- and this is a key feature which sets the book apart from its competitors. Sull walks the reader through some very useable steps for how companies can transform themselves and avert obsolescence. A great book, greatly written."
1,Surprise?,"This isn't about the musical content - it's about Jazz Oracle shipping burned CD-R. I received a copy and lo and behold discovered albeit professional artwork a burned CD-R. This appears to be a legitimate copy from a legitimate sell, one I've purchased from for years and complained about this fact, and they just go, hey we don't manufacture it, not real happy with that either. I have no problem if it's disclosed but that's not the case with this listing on Amazon or the item's packaging so hows a person to know? The main problem is Jazz Oracle not stating this on the product, wonder why they would do something like that ...duh? Still it's not right to the buyer! So Jazz Oracle sure took a hit in my books. FWIW"
5,Powerful! Intense!,I was absolutely astounded that this was a first novel for Jack Henderson. It was like being on a runaway train. Reminded me of Dan Brown's Digital Fortress and Deception Point which I absolute love. The characters were believable and the story was frighteningly believable. I'm not a Clancy fan and that's what I expected but was pleasantly surprised. Could not put it down. I am only sorry that his next book is not out until 2009. Mr. Henderson has a bright future as an author and I definitely look forward to his next. Would like for the next one to continue with some of the same characters but will have to wait until 2009!
5,Very enjoyable - action-packed and suspenseful!,"Circumference of Darkness is a delightful book that keeps the action and suspense moving. The characters are as unforgettable as the core plots of terrorism and heroism. Jack Henderson seems to be as knowledgeable about the complexity of human relationships as he clearly is about avionics, telecommunications, computers, and warfare.I highly recommend the book for anyone who enjoys a well-written, witty, and intellectual thriller."
4,Buy it before its all gone,"These figures have 14 points of articulation and are highly detailed. These are great for building your clone army and make sure you buy more than 1,I have 20 of them. The antenna is a nice addition, and the figure comes with a blaster, but it would have been better if it included the larger blaster from the quick draw attack clone#6. Other than that this figure is almost perfect.These guys have been selling like hotcakes and make sure you grab some before they are gone or you can always buy from scalpers at an inflated price"
3,universal mount,"This is actually a nice idea to have this universal mount, but the installation instructions could be MUCH better."
5,swisher atv mounting kit,The swisher mounting kit was very easy to hook up. the kit comes with a lot of extra brackets for diffrent atvs.It comes off easy when you are ready for the woods again.
5,A WONDERFULLY ANOINTED ADDITION TO HIS OTHER WRITINGS,This is a great book. It hits the issues of splits and divisions head on. What a wonderful addition to Francis Frangipane's already incredible list of books! Keep up the good work.
5,Real Life Examples!,I learned a lot and was reminded how the enemy uses church folk still in todays time! Very good reading!
1,not that hot,"I hate to say this, but it is the most boring Arkham House book I have ever read. Ideas behind some of the stories are mildly interesting, but the book kept putting me to sleep no matter how hard I tried to get through it."
5,Barn Red,I never heard of this movie until the passing of Ernest Borgnine and while looking up what was available on Amazon I came across this movie and others. Both my wife and I thoroughly enjoyed this movie and story.
4,Nice family movie,"We have enjoyed this movie over and over again. It was filmed in our neck of the wood and I love the lead actor. Not a award winner, but we sure do enjoy watching it."
3,Not what was expected,Not the quality and music type expected. Not the quality and music type expected. Not the quality and music type expected.
2,Listen to the samples before you buy,This will not be an elegant review.I have many slack key guitar albums by many different artists.This CD depresses me.Wish I had bought something else.
3,Roberto Ramirez,"I thought this book was pretty good. I have never actually read that many books before, but this one was good to me. It was very interesting to me how this book was formatted and put together. The main character, Esperanza, was a pretty good character except that she did not really like her name very much which I think she should since it was given to her by a family member. I think every person should like their name and not be ashamed of it because who cares what others think. Overall the book caught my attention and I did not want to put the book down at all. Sandra Cisneros is a very good author and I would look forward to reading another book of hers."
2,Not a Good Book ( English 162 reviews),"Honestly speaking, I don't like this book. The vocabulary and the sentences are very simple. Yet the structure and the characters are so confusing. I don't like the attitude of the main character too. Esperanza always complains where she lives and what she has. It's like she dislikes her house and her life so much. I don't like such a negative attitude towards life. I think there's still something lovely in Mango Street. Some people are able to live happily in poverty, why she cannot? She just complains, complains and complains. I think this book is not suitable for children to read. This will lead them to a negative judgement on the world."
3,Review of House On Mango Street,"House On Mango Street was a very simple book to read. The vocabulary wasn't too hard and it allowed the reader to have his own opinions. The main character is Esperanza, a girl that takes you through her childhood. I didn't think that the book was ever completely boring. The reading was short and the author always kept it simple. Considering that the book was mandatory I didn't mind reading the book at all. I think this book is entertaining and worth taking a glance at."
3,Very Unique,"Most of this book was written poeticly which made me want to read the chapters more than once.Sandra Cisneros used a lot of similies. A lot of the chapters made me have to think about them to understand them. This type of writing made this book unique in a good way. I recommend this book to book lovers of all kinds. If you want a book that is interesting and makes you think, then this is the book for you."
2,I am Bored - Hear Me ROAR !!,"Oh dear. Another one of those books with lofty, if not noble, ideas, but poor in execution. Honestly, if a 10th grader gave this in as their English Literature project at the end of the year, the teacher would probably only give them a 'B'. The only way I could get through this one was by leaving it in the bathroom as the only reading material for when I was sat on the bog. Go and buy a decent novel instead."
2,what's the point?,"People in high shool are reading this book and liking it!WHY! This is just a few fictional stories stories smashed together in 2 covers.Not to mention the grammer-I'd rate it a 0.5 in clarity. Out of all the books I've read this is NOT one of my favorites. If you want a REALLY good book, try Redwall by Brian Jacques."
2,I'm torn!,"Often, a literary masterpiece is one in which the author steps outside the box. Usually, the author gets praised for being different. ""The House on Mango Street"" is different indeed - so different that the author decided to abandon all the rules of the English language, by omitting quotations, commas and often words like ""is"" and ""of"" when they were absolutely necessary. I am not a fan of the book, however, it only took two hours for me to read it, so I recommend that the consumer buys a used version so that if you are disappointed, you would not have spent too much."
1,Dull Book,"This book just didn't do anything for me. It had no plot line whatsoever... just a bunch of mini, undetailed and uninteresting random stories about the people that live on Mango Street. The ending seemed sudden - it didnt build up to it like in other books. It just seems like she ran out of ideas so she just decided to end it. Highly disappointing."
1,Predictable,"Yes, this book discussed issues like sexism and racism, but it didn't offer any insight or anything new about these issues. It is horribly predictable, and, though the strange writing style certainly is noticable, the content itself is not out of the norm. This book has been required reading in many schools for the same reason there is affirmative action--Political Correctness. Otherwise, there's no reason to read this book."

1,TERRIBLE,All the reviews that explain how horrible this book is are 100% correct. I won't repeat what other people have already said. I was forced to read this for a school assignment. Do NOT read this book if you don't have to.
2,Teenage Diary,"I am a parent, and read this book recently because it is on the assigned reading list for freshmen at the local public high school. The best thing I can say about the book is that it is very short and can be read in a few hours. Essentially, it takes the form of a diary/journal of a young teenage Hispanic girl in a poverty-sticken section of Chicago. The author obviously has a feminist viewpoint. I will concede that the author is capable of a poetic turn of phrase, but overall the book is not well-written and could not possibly have been assigned in a Literature course as an example of high-quality writing. Instead, it apparently was selected by people who agree with the sociological opinions of the author, and who feel that those should be foisted onto the ninth-graders."
1,House On Mango Street!!,"The book House On Mango Street was a book written for herself. Sandra Cisneros wrote this book for the females of this world. I believe that she wants women to have the same thoughts as her, and that will never happen. Cisneros has an evil view of what men are. Does she hate men all together? I think that she is an angery woman all together. This book was a horrible book, and I feel bad for those who have to read this!"
1,This book totally blows,"I couldn't stand this book! I had to read it for an English class and couldn't stand it. The author is praised for being such a poet and blah blah blah, but she doesn't even know how to use quotation marks! Each chapter seems like a long poem and is really hard to read because of this. On top of Cisneros' inability to write properly, it has absolutely no plot whatsoever. It just keeps talking about growing up in ""da hood."" Save yourself and never read this book!"
1,Read If Desperate,Read this book when it is the only book left on Earth. This book is truly a work of disaster. The book doesn/t even make sense. Ever dumb chapter feels like a new book. Trust me....Don't Read this book!
3,Really Funny,"The house on mango street was a book that i chose to read for school because it was one of many to choose from.At first I chose it because it was the shortest book, but it actually turned out pretty good. i thought it was really funny with the hobo and the dollar."
2,Must be good for poetry loving adolescent girls,"I read this book as it was required summer reading for a local high school.WHAT????This book is a collection of short vignettes about a girl growing up in a Hispanic family. Perhaps this is of interest to SOMEBODY but not this middle aged man nor most teen boys. I felt like I was trapped in a chick book (not always bad), written by a poet (not always bad) celebrating diversity (not always good). The stories were short and the redeeming value was that there were so many partial pages that it was half as long as it looked. Cisneros has written poetry and this book has the feeling of poetry (not always good). I am sorry for the high school boys who were required to read it!!"
2,boring book,"To be honest,I didn't like this book. There were a lot of short stories put together to make a boring book, to many characters to remember It sound like if the author was complaining about her chilhood. All the chapter were disjointed. Overall, I didn;t like the structure and the book in general."
4,The Journey of Zeze the X,"Ages 12 and up (Young Adults)Written in vignettes, House on Mango Street, by Sandra Cisneros portrays snapshots of a young Mexican girl's life. Esparanza Cordero is growing up in a rundown Latino area of Chicago. Life is sometimes harsh for a young girl with big dreams, when no one has great expectations of her.Esparanza notices that many people in her neighborhood sit at windows longing to be free, often settling for disappointing lives with broken dreams. From the start Esparanza wanted more than a house with hallway stairs and crumbling red bricks. Esparanza does not want to belong in the worn-out neighborhood on Mango Street.Esparanza is a powerful and insightful girl who depicts her childhood with satin scars and greasy cold rice sandwiches."
2,Review for class,"This book is told through the life of Esperanza and her family. Throughout her life she had lived in many house, some of which she cant remember where they were, but the one that had made the biggest impression in her life was the house on Mango Street. She tells stories that she remebers from her childhood and each story centers on a different detail. Every detail tells the story of how she wants her life to be better and at the same time the same as it was at ""The House on Mango Street."""
3,A good picture of life in the Latino district of Chicago,"Our book club of five 12 and 13 year old girls read this book for book club, and we had mixed feelings about it. It is a good book if you like the idea of little sections of someones life, that are not really explained, but when they are put together, it portrays a very vivid picture for this girl's life growing up."
4,Who's going to do it [make it better]? Not the mayor.,"This novel consists of forty-four vignettes in the life of a young Mexican-American girl (I believe she is about thirteen or fourteen years old) named Esperanza Cordero, growing up in the Latino section of Chicago (I would guess in the late 1960s or 1970s). These brief and colorful vignettes, presented in a beautiful voice, tell of Esperanza's family, friends, and neighbors and enable the reader to see the young girl growing up and maturing before our eyes. The book also demonstrates the role of the environment on helping to shape and direct a person's life. It also places responsibilities on the shoulders of individuals to ""make things better."""
5,Lyrical indeed,"I have read this book with my high school students year after year, and I love it every time. Please understand, dear reader, this is a book of incredibly lyrical prose, and at times it is really more of a narrative poem. In fact, I read it as such with my students. At first they complain: 'I don't get it!' But as time goes on, and I continue to read the short vignettes (and we discuss such things as names, as hair, as beloved grandparents, as the places we've lived), they begin to see the portrait of Esperanza's life being painted for them with words... beautiful words. My favorite chapter is Darius and the Clouds. Just gorgeous writing there...."
1,A very dragging book,The House on Mango street is in my opinion a very bad book. It is a book that has no point and it drags while you read it. The book is not good at blending each chapter into one another. The content is terrible and some of the topic do not even make sense.
3,Reading for class,"I had to read this book for a class I had. I would never read this book on my own.It is an ok book, full of short stories and quite easy to read.I don't like to way it is written though, it seems to be a bit haphazardly written. Sometimes it is hard to know who is speaking and what some of the meanings are."
2,The House on Mango Street,"The House on Mango Street is a difficult book to follow for those who like a plot that is easy to find. I happen to be one of those people, and therefore did not think very highly of Cisneros novel. This book is merely a description of characters of those that live on Mango Street, and the happenings that occur there. Also this novel is written to the way of speaking on Mango Street, in improper English. There are quite a bit of different themes throughout the book. It seems the author was expressing a new theme with about every two chapters or so. Through the descriptions of Mango Street and its people, you notice the main character growing and becoming older. However this book does show character development, I do not recommend it, nor do I prefer it."
2,The House on Mango Street,"The House on Mango Street is a book without chapters but small vignettes. The book is about a little girl in the latino section of Chicago where she grows up. The book approached from a plot standpoint is not a great book. But if one goes inside the book a little more and explores the themes then one will like the book a little more. Many books like this are very horrible however this one is strikingly marvelous. The author did a very good job describing the characters, settings, and made the themes very noticeable."
4,My Review,My review on is The House On Mango Street.This book is about a young girl named Esperenza who is a part of a family of six. She has a lot of hopes and dreams of living in a better place.She describes her dream home like the ones she sees on tv.A big white house with picket fences and a lot of rooms.Right now she lives in a crappy house and shares one room with five other family members. Although she didn't have much she still made the best out of things.I rated this book by giving it a four. I gave this book a four because it's based on reality.She deals with the same issuea that a typical family would deal with.They did not have much but she didn't walk around with her head down in the dumps.
4,House on Mango Street Review,"This book is an easy read, but with deep and complicated issues. You can imagine the childish voice as you read through the hardships of the young girl, Esperanza. She is a bold character who feels that her own name doesn't represent her. Esperanza struggles to express her self in her lonely neighborhood and desperately seeks a way out. This poetic novel is emotional, but can also be joyful."
3,REVIEW ON MANGO STREET,"The book ""The House On Mango Street"" was midly interesting.The book is about a young latina girl named Esperanza learning how to grow up on urban streets. Esperanza learned how to grow up on urban streets.Esperanza tells stories about the whole blocks. The books has little stories in each chapter,which i didn't like, because im not used to reading books like that. Sandra Cisneros brought the book to alive by the words she used.I loved how she used Spanish words in her book. So people can get understanding what language. The way I related to the book was the chapter hairs in my family we have different type of hair."
5,House on mango Street,"This is my first book review so if its not what u expected, my bad. Here it goes...The book overall was a great book. An book that many people can relate to. Also a goos book for people who don't read a lot."
1,It's too confusing!!!!,"The House on Mango Streetwas one of the books I had to read over the summer. I wish my high school had better taste. I'm a fast reader and it took my 2 days to finish the book because I simply could not read this book in one sitting (and that'sa shame at 110 pages). The book was hard to swallow. All the really short stories were confusing, as if Esperanza had about three thousand mood swings. None of them had any connection unless you count the fact that they revolved aroud the world of the same person. I usually like reading between the lines but doing it in this book is like plulling teeth out. If you like reading between the lines, go read a book like The Thorn Birds."
1,It was a very boring book.,I did not like the book. It was very long and had too many vingettes to read. This book put me to sleep.
1,this book is bad,this lady in the book whose name is esperanza obviosly has no self esteem she is hard on herself throughout the whole making the whole experience very unrealistic
1,The House on Mango Street,"To be be kind to the author, this work was indescribeable. It sucked beyond the vacumm of space. I fell asleap during the middle of the book!!! The writing style was as advanced as a 3 year old. I got lost in the book because the transition between mini-stories was so abrupt. I was unable to establish an environment, time, and location. The House on Mango Street should be sold with a bed."
1,HORRIBLE BOOK!,"This book is HORRIBLE! Why does it get so much praise! It is a boring, totally weird view of the Latino culture. If I want to be put to sleep I'll read this book again."
1,"Actually, it doesn't even deserve one star.","This book was horrible. It had no plot line. None. It's just a jumbled up bunch of stories. Also, there are no quotation marks, which makes it rather difficult to understand. Since the main character (Esperenza) doesn't really have a good description, it's difficult to understand her. But I guess the book does deserve that one star; it'll keep me warm in the winter when I burn every last page."
1,i hate this book,"i was forced to read this book in english class and, i mean school isn't supposed to be fun but this book is torture. i hate it. it seems as if it wasn't even edited. there are no quotation marks around the speech and there are a buch of incomplete scentinces. i wouldn't give this any stars but i have to give it one. this is the worst book i have ever read. amd that is saying alot."
2,Not really what I'm into,"I had to read this book for my freshman year in school. Now, this book just wasn't my cup of tea. But this is just my opinion. The book just sucked. It was confusing and it talked about alot of [...] that I don't give a s**t about. It describes a bunch of useless details about a character in every chapeter (thats two pages long by the way) But I just didn't know what was going on in the story. I really don't think it has a specific plot.But like I said I just didn't enjoy this book. You may like it though, it just depends what your into."
1,House on Sh**** street,"OK people any good reviews you have heard are just flat out lies. This is the worst book ever wriiten beside maybe "" Last exit to Brooklyn."" no that was even better. This is the crappiest book ever it ruins latino writing and people's outlook on it. Anybody who likes this trash is crazy. This book is just a waste of paper and publishing money and everything that goes into a book. The book is so stupid and I think Sandra Cisnero's is not an up and coming book writer I think she is a horrible writer. I haven't even gotten to the end and i want to stop reading it. THIS IS CRAP."
3,I wish it was the 25th edition like the picture shows.,I wish it was the 25th edition like the picture shows. It was a false advertisement but the book was in great condition.
2,There was a rip,"Well, it has rip on the back page which I didn't remember reading about it when I purchaced the book.I'm glad to have it by the time they said they will send and I will receive.The book itself is fair."
3,EH,THE BOOK WAS A LITTLE CONFUSING BECAUSE IT SEEMED TO JUMP AROUND ALOT. IT HAD INTERESTING CHAPTERS BY ITSELF BUT IT DID NOT FLOW TOGETHER.
2,bought this for school,"This was a book that I had to read for my literature class in college. It wasn't bad, just not a story I would choose to read on my own. It is a masterpiece with words and word pictures, but the storyline was a bit depressing."
5,A great book...,"Sandra Cisneros's The House on Mango Street was a really good book. I love reading poetry and this whole book is full of poetry.The events that occur in the book are very believable because I can relate and probably so can many other people. I would recommend this book for people who love to read or people who just want to get an idea of a Hispanic Community in Chicago.Some people may find it confusing but it's not, it's a different style of writing.It's a short read but there are many small messages but you just got to pay close attention to it.Like some say, it's the quantity of the work that counts, it's the quality that really counts.If anyone is interested in poetry or curious about the life of a Hispanic Community then go out and read this book."
3,Hous On Mango Street,"House On Mango Street, the story of a girl who is growing up in the struggling parts of Chicago. I thought that the girl, Esperanza, was interesting and she obviously had a alot of thoughts. This book seemed to be like her diary and all the things that she was going through in her life. The main conflict is hard to follow because it is so scattered but i think that the main conflict is that she wants to get out of this neighborhood and find a better life. I liked this book but it was confusing and hard to follow. Out of 10 I will give this book a 7."
3,The House On Mango Street,"I though t the novel was pretty good.I thought it would take longer to read.But it didn't.I guess I was really into it.What I liked about the book was each chapter wasn't that long.The stories were put together well.Even though some stories were short.They were interesting and caught my attetion.The author's writing style was good.I liked how each chapter or story was different.It wasn't like other books.It wasn't boring.I don't think the novel really had any affect on me.I don't think the characters or there lives are really similar to me,except that Esperanza and Nenny think alike as well as me and my brothers.I would recommend this book because it's interesting.It doesn't get boring.It catches your attention quick."
2,Fock this book,"I did hear that the book was pretty good. But its not my kind of book. Its a pretty meaningful book that requires deep thought. I personally thought it was not quite good because there was a lack of direction in the book. It skips from one topic to another. It may be a good book, but I don't recommend it."
3,Surprising,"This book gave me security and dreams in the beginning. It allowed me to know that children with big thoughts do dream big, even if they don't have the best in life at that certain moment. What scared me the most was when she couldn't trust and was scared the most. The unforgettable part."
2,students point of view,"This book is directed towards females so that might be why I didn't like it. It never got my attention. Maybe it was the way that it was written or maybe the contents of the book. There were very few parts of this book that I enjoyed. One part I enjoyed was when Louie's cousin stole a car and all of the kids asked where he got it from and he said, ""get in."" Another part I liked was when she got her first kiss and it wasn't all she thought it was supposed to be. Esperanza said, ""I waited my whole life. You're a liar."" Reading this book was like reading French, another language because it was a girl book. I would recommend this book to a girl, but not to a guy. ""One day you wake up and they are there,"" says Esperanza. She was talking about hips, and growing up from a girl to a young woman throughout the whole book."
3,Sandra Cisneros is a brilliant**,"She truley shows her reader what it was like growing up poor, and yet still suceeding in life"""
2,My review on the book House On mago street,"The House on Mango Street by Sandra Cisneros , was like many poems put together to make a book. At the same time the book was being told by Esperanza the main character. This book was just wonderful. It's not the first nor the second time I have read this book, its been the fourth, I just can't stop reading it. Its wonderful how she tells her life in this book. How her life is in sections and how she succeeds in life with her sister and the people around her. reading this book seems like Sandra Cisneros should of been a poet not a writer, butt he way she combines things is nice. The main reason why I liked this book was because of the way how she combines two languages English and spanish, two great languages. To me after reading this book gave me a differentperpective on why people live the way they do, and that by dreaming things could become reality."
2,Why I didn't like the book!,I thought the vignettes were disjointed. I felt that the book confusing because there were so many different characters and stories. The author could have tied all the stories together at the end to complete the ending.
3,Mango Street,"This thought-provoking series of vignettes follows a young Mexican-American girl, Esperanza, through a series of events that all come together to tell the story of her journey into young adulthood.The vignettes tell the story of Esperanza&#65533;s new experiences and how she is beginning to realize her place in her family and community. She finds that to escape the stereotypes of her culture, she will have to branch out and become her own person and possibly leave Mango Street.The story of Esperanza&#65533;a life features wonderful plots and characters, but can be slightly repetitive and hard to follow at times."
4,I liked it,I had to read this in my English Composition class and I thought it was very good and interesting. The characteres and story are both well-told. Cisneros is a good writer and she doesn't bore the reader to tears like cough cough John Steinbeck cough. This was the first book by Cisneros that I read and I am interested in her other works. Hopefully they will be as good as hers.
5,a book worth reading........,"the house on mango street, by sandra cisneros, is a truly charming book. the author weaves the reader into a tapestry of powerful vignettes, each with a hidden message that only can be uncovered by the reader, if they are willing. i was so overcome by the power of this book that i wrote an essay about it for a previous english class of mine. my teacher not only appreciated the essay, but also the book. she was the one who recommended the book, and i'm glad she did. without a doubt, if you're looking for a book this summer that will enlighten your mind and spirit, the house on mango street is it."
2,What was she thinking!?!,"This book was forced on me as summer reading. For the constraints of space, I'll list my complaints:1) Exceedingly dull. 2) There may have been symbolism, but it was buried. 3) Plot less, theme less. 4) Can't decide between poetry and prose. 5) I don't care in the least."
3,There Was No Story,"This would've been better if there was actually a story, rather than blurbs of information. Not a bad book, but there are certainly better ones. Excellent symbolism! Overall, this book is a B- or a C+."
4,It is a heart warming and wonderful book.,"""The House on Mango Street"" was a lovely novel. at the begining i was a little skeptical at first but once i got into it, my heart was truly for esperanza, the main character. This book is a lovely way to convey the spanish culture to readers of all ages. This is a wonderful book to read on a saturday afternoon, in a corner of your house in a comfy chair. It is a heart warming and wonderful book."
4,It was great,"It was a good book although it kind of went off the wall a couple of times. You didn't understand the story she was telling at times, but Cisneros' surely made up for it for her great poetic style of writing. Great Job!!!"
4,The novel is written in an intresting way and very creative!,"I enjoyed the novel although it was short. The short sonnets allow the reader to stay focussed and interested. It also is written in a creative and intersting way. I do not rate this book a five because it was not so intresting that I couldn't put it down. Just about anyone could relate the novel to their own life experiences and I believe it should be read for all cultures. After reading the novel I now feel that I know Sandra Cisneros as a writer and as a person. My favorite sonnet was ""Where I Live."" Which basiclly talks about her home and neighborhood. Overall the novel was a great learning experience."
5,A must read for every woman!,"""A smile is a wrinke in the face that should never be removed"" This book is a must read for every woman, regardless of age or race, and I guranatee there will be a smile on the reader's face! Every woman can understand this young girls pains, joys, and thoughts as she matures. Cisneros tackles the ever timeless literary elements of gender roles, culture clashes, and assimiliation, while still providing a delightful,and easy to read book. Most readers can relate to the fact the Esperanza's character and ideals develop from those around her and her experiences, much like ours do! I believe that there is at least one chapter, that the reader can relate to and think of their own life! Because of this book, I have a smile on my face that will never be removed!"
4,Recommended to All Young Adult Readers,"The book ""The House On Mango Street"" was great.The chapters weren't so long, so I didn't get bored. It was more like a collection of short stories than one long story. Each chapter had a whole new and different topic, and these topics made many short stories in the book. It was entertaining and fun to read. At some points ,it was so amusing that I laughed out loud! It also gave an account of a Latina girl growing up in America. I would recommend this book to all young adult readers."
2,Mexicans aren't the only Hispanics in the US,"I read the book because my daughter has to read it for her summer reading list...We were both Disapointed. The book stinks....If you want to read a book about the Hardships of the Hispanic Culture in the US especially in NYC, read ""Down These Mean Streets"" by Piri Thomas. Please remember the Mexican culture is all over the place being forced down on our throats..THERE ARE OTHER HISPANIC Cultures that warrant representation. Cubans, Dominicans, Puerto Ricans...enough with the Mexican Culture..How about Claude Browns, ""Manchild in the Promised Land"" a book about the grittiness of African Americans back in the day. How about Frank McCourts, ""Angela's Ashes"".....House on Mango Street the dumbing down of America"
1,Horrifyingly Bland,"Follow a young girl through her youth in a nearly endless series of short vignettes. She encounters all sorts of troubles and mishaps, but for the most part, the book describes a strange childhood in horribly exaggerated detail. Some say it's very deep, which it undoubtedly is, iff the reader has the courage to read between the lines (in an unfortunate addition to the already astoundingly boring printed text), and iff the reader indeed cares about the girl and what she thinks at all (I did not). A few of the vignettes are entertaining; however, for the most part, they are very difficult to get through despite their brevity.FYI: ""iff"" is a math term meaning ""if and only if""."
2,This Book Inspired My Inner Whiny Immigrant,"Do you whine a lot? Do you like to talk to trees? Do you constantly moan about your house and think you are too good for everything? If you answered yes to any of the following questions, this book is for you. For the rest of the world, STAY AWAY FROM THIS BOOK! It is trash!"
1,Bad Book,"This book is pointless. I had to read it for a collage exam and found it to be the worst book i had ever read. Their is no point to the book, their are just a bunch of sort stories that have no connection what so ever. If you are thinking about buting this book don't do it, you'll just find your self disatisfied with a book that should have never been published. If it were possible i wouldn't have givin this book any stars because it doesn't deserve them. However, 1 star is the lowest you are allowed to give so i guess i'll just have to settle for that."
1,You will regret reading this book!,Don't read this book unless you are looking for a chaotic mess of slurred messages. This book is the most terrible uneducated attempt at a coming of age story you will ever come across. Don't read this boring stack of disorganized papers about nothing in particluar you will surly regret picking this book up. if i could put negative stars on this review be sure to know i would. don't buy this book!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
2,Disappointed,"After reading the positive reviews on this book, I was disappointed. I found the book boring and a waste of my time."
5,Delicious,"Reading this book is like eating dessert. Each vignette stands on its own as a work of art. Like dessert, the book isn't meant to be devoured quickly, but savored piece by piece. Excellent!"
3,The House On Mango Street,"What I thought of the book was it was a pretty good book. What I liked about the novel was it would always change. It would be on one topic, then it would change to another topic. The Authors writing style was alright, what I liked was that she would always put a new character in every chapter of the novel. By reading this book it affected me to give a book a chance to read it. To tell the truth Im not a big time reader this is the first book i ever read cover to cover. The characters in the novel are not similar to my family at all. If i had to chose a family member to caompare a character to it would be my little sister April twards Esparanza. My litle sister is like Esparanza in one way, she has her own little world she loves to explore. The only person I would recommend this book to my sister April she loves these kind of books, she loves to read books that are based on true lives."
2,For The Young At Heart,"The House on Mango Street, a novel written by Sandra Cisneros. This novel while written thoughtfully was quite refreshing. The storylines were sort of difficult to follow, but when the message was finally figured out, I must admit that I was quite pleased. In the beginning I wasn't quite sure how I would enjoy this book, but as the discussion grew deeper, my interst in Esperenza grew. I felt her displeasure as she talked about her name, I felt her shyness at school. I could actually picture myself in her shoes. I enjoyed the innocence expressed especially during the part when God was talked about and it was described as if God's just there. Did I enjoy this story? Yes. Would I recommend it to everyone? Depends on the person. But I do know that this book turned out to be better than I thought."
3,Simple writing style for a deep book.,"House on Mango Street is wonderfully written. The reader sees and feels trough Esperanza's eyes and is able to understand better what the girl has in mind. This way of writing stresses this feeling. The vignettes look like the page of a dairy, and the style seems to really belong to the young girl. This book can be considered as a children book, but it suits every age and some nuances need a mature viewpoint. What's more House on Mango Street allows the reader to understand the double problem felt by a Hyspanic girl. A easy but deeply moving book which must have the chance to be be read by everybody at every age."
4,this really is something you should read,"I am surprised to see so many reviews call this the ""other"" side of life. It amazes me that we as a culture are still so quick to marginalize when we can. Esperanza is not the big bad ""other"" marginalized to the point that people from the central group cannot relate -- she talks about family, home, growing up, and feeling both comfortable and uncomfortable at the same time. While the vignettes do indeed jump from idea to idea, considering its postmodern roots (if one can say postmodernism has such groundings), the juxtaposition of the vignettes tells a reader more than a blatant observation could. This is a great read as an entire novel(la?), but you should find yourself returning to individual vignettes. And you will find that you relate, no matter what group you think you belong to!"
1,"This author needs help, or the publisher does.","Sorry to all you obscure people who think this a wonderful book, but this book is definetely not a good book by my standards. I'm a lazy person so I don't really like to take the time to analyze things and read ""between the lines."" Take a look at that book. Theres a one page chapter in it entitled ""Hairs."" Please tell me what the significance is of that. Here's one word to describe this book: WEIRD. Don't read it."
1,I was expecting better...,"Maybe I just don't like stories written as a series of vignettes. I'm not sure, but I just felt this book was boring and didn't really show me much about the Latin culture as I was expecting. It also was confusing because all the vignettes you weren't sure when took place and who all these people were in them. It needed more background information to make it more understandable. It was almost if the author was putting a bunch of poems together and expecting them to totally make sense."
1,Stupid Book,Sandra Cisneros wrote proably one of the most annoying books in the whole world. The parts about her mother and her going to school are pointless and the only good part about it was the descriptive part. The book and all the hispanic heritage behind just did not do it for me. The only reason I read the stupid book is becuase it was a book we had to read for class. If you are looking for a book to read for fun do not pick this one.
2,Severely Overrated,"While the writing here is engrossing and well done at times, it is quite self-indulgent and disconnected, too. I suppose it has been praised so extravagantly because it is written in such an accessible style. However, at times it reads like a poorly done imitation of Sherwood Anderson's Winesburg, Ohio."
2,My Mangos,"The book was o.k. It was a little boring, but what I really liked was the name of the chapters. The rest of the book was not all that interesting. I like a book with action. This book has no type of action whatever. If it had a little of action I would have enjoyed it. The girl in the book has no life. She was telling boring stories about her life. So now I close with saying this is just my opinion not a fact. So you read at your own risk."
2,This book was OK,"I finished reading this book about a week ago. Cisneros has quite a flair and I love her writing style. She is very poetic and has good word choice. One thing I did not like about her book was the very short chapters, they were well written and had good ideas, but you wanted to read more about that incident and the chapter was over, And the next chapter would have nothing to do with the prior one. This book would have been much better if it was consistent. I also think that she drew too much pity on to the main charector, who really didn't deserve it."
4,IT IS A GREAT BOOK,"It is about a hispanic girl growing up in the latino section of Chicago. It is told in a vignettes. She has moved twice before Mango Street. She has a nickname, which is Esperanza. This is a good book. The problem is that it is confusing, and I did not undcerstand it but otherwise it is a good book. I would recommend it to people who like her work and understand vignettes."
4,The House on Mango Street,"I thought this book was fairly interesting and could hold my attention. However, it is extremely easy reading, so it does not offer a challenge or any new vocabulary. The story does not have a plot that you can really follow either. This book tells of a young girl named Esperanza and her childhood in a barrio in Chicago in the 1980's. It is a story of Esperanza's coming of age as a Hispanic in America. One of the coming of age incidents is when she wanted to stay at school to eat her lunch b/c she thought that it was gonna be really cool. However, in the end the grass had just been greener on the other side, and Esperanza ended up sitting alone at a table at school eating her soggy sandwich. If you like an easy reading book that you can probably finish within an hour or so, then this is a great book for you."
3,I really don't get the hype.....,"I'm not saying that this book is a total wash, but I really don't understand how people can recommend this book on a large scale other than it's hispanic in nature, and there's not many hispanic authors to speak of. Being written in vignettes makes it difficult to follow (if at all) as a storyline. Because of the vignettes, it's very teacher friendly---you can very easily ask a class the same types of questions you'd ask during a poetry unit. I would not recommend this book because to recommend a book is to not recommend another, and there are just too many books out there (yes, written by hispanic authors) that are friendlier to the reader."
3,Review of My View,"I though this novel was okay because it pretty much covers what really happens on the streets/nieghborhood. I didn't like how every chapter was really short. I liked that it had real Mexican terms and I learned some that I didn't know. Cisneros has a great writing style, the only problem was that the chapters were really short. It didn't erally effect me because I've never lived in a neighborhood like hers. The only similar thing is being Mexican. I would recomend people to read the book so they can see how it's like growing up in a Mexican nieghborhood. This book is a about a little girl who has a dreamto have a house of her own, to have a house to be proud of, to have a house to point to!"
2,THEHOUSE ON MANGO STREET,Mango street was an ok book in theory.I did not like it because it seemed boring but maybe it is because it was about girls.Ilike the seperate peace it had much of the same thing with only boys.Insteadof runing around they did daring joumps and sports and water.Mango street was a life of a young girl boring.I did like the yellow teeth monkey.
2,my opinion,"My opinion on The House on Mango Street, is that I really didn't get all of it. there were parts where I didn't understand what was going on in the story, and then there were parts where I could actually get a mental picture of what was going on and what the house look like that they were liveing in. So to coclude my opinion, the book wasn't terriable, it just wasn't my type of book."
2,Why are we reading this instead of a classic?,"The House on Mango Street, by Sandra Cisneros, was one of the most boring books I've ever read. I really didn't like Cisneros' writing style or the way she wrote about life on Mange Street in a series of vignettes. I feel that the book didn't really have a middle, and the ending didn't really end anything, the book just kind of stopped. The reading didn't effect me in any way. The characters are hard for me to relate to. The one part in the book that I do like, however, is the vignette in which the main character, Esperanza, describes how the only thing that she can talk to are the trees. Based on the above opinions, I would not recommend this book to anyone, and ask the question: why are we reading this book instead of a classic?"
3,House On Mango Street Review,"""The House on Mango Street"" by Sandra Cisneros was a realistic, however plot-less story based upon independence, male domination, and perjudice. Cisneros brings problems faced by many women today, into a fictional story. Becuase this story is plottless, I would not recommend it to a suspence/action reader. But for those who can find the inner-meaning of the story, and be able to relate it to everyday life, it is wonderfully, and creativly done. I give this book an over-all 3-stars becuase it does make a point, and tackle controversial topics. However, it failed to entertain me."
3,An Interesting Piece of Literature,"The House on Mango Street was interesting indeed. The book was written in a rare style, one that I have never seen before. The style in which it was written gave the book a slightly confusing plot, one with many twists and turns. I for one had trouble following it. Each separate story or chapter was very simple in itself, but as a whole picture, it was slightly more complex. In this book lay many hidden meanings and themes. You have to read with the right attitude to truly understand the concepts in which Cisneros writes about. I enjoyed quite a few of the stories, but as a whole novel, it was much less intriguing."
2,House on Mango Street,"On a crowded little street in Chicago lives Esperanza, an extremely young Latino girl who has been growing up in a very bad neighborhood all her life. Esperanza has trouble accepting where she is from and hates to admit the fact that she is poor. In this book you will find that it is more like a diary than a book. In Sandra's writing she explains things very deeply and and detailed. You get a glimpse of how bad things can really get for some people around the world. If your looking for a book that will interest you intil the very end than this is the one you will want to read."
4,Everyday life in the hood,"This was a pleasurable read complete with snapshots of neighborhood life. There is something for everyone in this true to life novel. We all have the strange lady on the block, the local friendly addict, neglected children, loving families with kind children, and those who look down on others even though their plight is the same as everyone elses. Enjoy this short, sweet, truthful look at life."
3,Mango Street an excellent read,"Sandra Cisneros's book, The House on Mango Street, makes for an interesting read as you see life through the eyes of a young hispanic girl growing up in inner city Chicago. The book is an exellent portrayal of the harships and challanges that she faces as she struggles with challenges in her life, and tell of the challenges those around her face. I enjoyed this book because with every vignette you found out more and more about the charactor, such as her dream of a house of her own. By the end of the book it was as though I had known her my whole life. The only part of the book I did not like was that there was no closure. You are left to wonder if this girl's drems ever came true? Or like so many others were they forgotten?"
4,English 163 Mango,"I don't like reading but i actually read this book and I liked it's so easy to read and to comprehend the content. I love the way she described the house of her dream using powerful metaphors, the meaning of her name and some other stuff. Trying to fit in a society where you don't belong must be hard for Esperanza, but I like the way she goes on with her life, she keeps positive attitudes toward her future and she doesn't give up her dream and that's great. If can't have them now you can have them later."
4,Good book...,"I enjoyed reading ""The House on Mango Street"" and Esperanza's sometimes disorderly events that lead her throughout her childhood days up to her adulthood. The storytelling of Esperanza's unbecoming life on Mango Street was a rounded book with humor and seriousness."
4,Latin Novel,"The House on Mango Street show us how the immigrants Latino live, work, needs, customs, etc. Everyone will know Why a lot of people came to USA. I was surprise when this book is used in High School assignments."
4,Used for school but good book just the same,"I bought this book to read for school. It's a quick read and I enjoyed it much more than your average school reading. I liked the way it was written a lot. Even if you don't have to, this is a book you may want to read just to say you did. You may walk away feeling a little more cultured and open minded."
3,Latin Experience???,"I really expected this book to shed light on what it could be light to grow up Latin in America. While there are a few (very few) glimpses into Esperanza's feelings on growing up Latin or ""brown"" and how that was an ""otherness"" for her, however, I felt that the book mainly was about the shame of growing up in poverty. Poverty is not unique to the Latin culture in America. There are other, and in my opinion better, books on growing up poor in America. One that comes to mine is ""A Tree Grows in Brooklyn."" Yes, that takes place at a earlier time period in American history, but the same sentiments about shame are there with fully developed characters and story."
4,Quick but pleasant read,"This is so far the best analysis of ""ghetto"" life I have read so far. The narrator is an girl growing up in a family juggling on the border of poverty, yet her spirit transcends her socioeconomic environment while remaining a part of it. Inspiring and truthful, this one might make you rethink some of your beliefs and prejudices on how ""the other half lives."""
4,Touching and full of power,"Sandra Cisnero's novel, The House on Mango Street, is a nice work made up of various vignettes that span through many childhood memories. As a Mexican-American, I was able to identify so much with this short and charming work. It was easy to read and very rich in poetry. I have heard many people complain about the way she decided to write. Poets are allowed to break the rules in order to work the magic of their art...read this with an open mind and heart and you won't be disappointed."
2,A brief and interesting story about life in Chicago.,This book takes you to one of the many unique neighborhoods which make up Chicago. It is the Latin neighborhood on Mango St. where the character Esperenza finally moves to with her family after several apartments all over the city. Each vignette deals with a person on the block and their unique story to tell. The stories themselves can be confusing at times can leave the reader perplexed. There is no indication during the book that the story will change. They are brief and to the point which is good in a way. Growing up in Chicago I can relate to some of this story. If someone who is from a rural setting reads this book they might miss the point about life in the big city.
2,The House on Mango Street,"I am a freshman going into high school, and this was one of the books for our summer reading. My classmates and I all agreed we thought the book was boring. There really was no plot to the story at all. Some people say that this book is a great piece of literarure. I really didn't see what was so great about it. Maybe this style of writing just isn't for me. I think adults would like this book more than kids or teens. The only part I liked was the end, it went well with the beginning."
2,Very dull reading,"This book was not by any means inspirational. The style of writing was unorganized and hard to follow. The theme of a Hispanic girl trying to find her way in a place where it was hard to succeed could have been very good if not for the author's feel sorry for me theme rather then an inspirational story.The poems and collections of stories go nowhere. The book hardly kept me going and if I would have stopped after the first ten pages I would not have felt I missed anything. A good book grabs the reader's attention, but this book simply made me bored and impatient.Due to the lack of excitement and inspiration I found the book to be more negative then positive. Overall I would not recommend this book to a reader of any age."
1,"wrong ad, wrong refund",this seller has no books that i ordered (website shows the books). the refund was not correct for a couple of dollars short......... don't know why ??
1,Never got product or refund,"This is the confirmation I got: ""available to ship by April 30,2009"".It is May 30th and I don't have the book yet. I contacted the seller twice. No response the first time, then on May 27 he wrote to say that he had not shipped the item yet! This is a book I needed for a class I attend 4 times a week!I asked the seller to process a refund instead. So far I have no book and no refund. I am not buying from Pepitone ever again, and will think twice before buying from Amazon.com again as I now know that one could get stranded when buying a book online that one really needs. Next time I'll take a trip to the Barnes and Nobles store near me."
3,This is a OK book,"this book is good to read when you are bored or have nothing to do.I would recommend it if you have alot of spare time and is always bored. I liked it i did not have any problems with it, it did not get me bored. I also could compare things in the book with my life and problems i had, so i would really get into the book sometimes."
4,The House on Mango Street,The House on Mango Street is a well written book. It is about a hispanic girl named Esperanza and what she went through living in a barrio. The book has a little girl writting about adult subjects. She is very perseptive and observent about her neighbors and the world around her. I would recommend this book to anyone of all ages because in every chapter there is something different for everyone to relate to. I really liked it.
3,the house on mango st.,"THIS BOOK ABOUT A YOUNG GIRL GROWING UP IN THE ""BAD PART OF TOWN"" IS THE WIERDEST BOOK I HAVE EVER READ. IT IS MADE UP OF A BUNCH OF SMALL DESCRIPTIONS OF EVENTS IN HER LIFE AND DOSENT MAKE ENOUGH SENSE UNTILL YOU GET TOWARDS THE END OF THE BOOK. THIS FEATURE MADE THIS BOOK MOST UNENJOYABLE TO READ BUT IN THE LONG RUN AGTER BEING FORCED TO READ THE WHOLE THING AND EVERYTHING CAME TOGETHER IT WAS A PRETTY GOOD BOOK. I WOULD KIND OF RECOMEND THIS BOOK BECAUSE IT REALLY GIVES YOU A VEIW OF WHAT ITS LIKE LIVEING IN A POOR NEIBORHOOD BUT THERES A BUNCH OF WAY BETTER BOOKS OUT THERE."
3,An ok short book,"This book is almost like the book seeds except from one person's perspective. This book is about a Hispanic family moving into a crummy neighborhood. The people and places give it a ghettoish feeling. This book is okay, but you really need to be in the mood to read this book. This book could have been a lot better, but it seemed to drag on. If you needed to read a book on a Hispanic poor family then this book is a prime choice"
2,"""No Sir, I Didn't Like It.....""","""The House On Mango Street"", in my opinion, is not one of the highest rated books on my list. Cisneros did give us a good sub-story filled with a deeper meaning to the world around the main character Esperanza, but the theme itself, and the main story taking place, were quite poor to me. In some ways, I do not think this book appeals to the style of books that I enjoy, such as Anne Rice, or Piers Anthony, filled with a deeper writing and passages the role off your tongue like an ongoing poem of sweet music lined with sadness. For big ""Fantasy-only"" fans such as myself, I would not recommend this book at all."
2,The House on Mango Street review,"""The House on Mango Street"" is not a book I would reccomend to anyone. The book has so many characters that it becomes hard to keep track of them. The book has no single plot. It is difficult to keep track of what's is going on. All of the different vigenettes have nothing to do with each other. If you really want to understand the book you need to keep a notebook next to you to keep track of everything. The main character, Esperanza, has so many thoughts in her head that it becomes hard to keep track of what she is thinking. I hope you take my advice and not pick up this book."
2,My Review,"I thought that this book was not that great as all the reviews say. I think it was lacking much organization, and it is really complicated. It had very little flow in the storyline, and since it was based on a large number of vignettes, it didn't make a lot of sense to me. I'd say that if your looking for a good read, pick up a book by Crichton or Bakker,this book was a neat idea, but could've been better."
3,More or Less,"This book its the first book I read in English.Also it is important to me. About the book,for me its more or less because they dont have sequence.And my style is different. I like ""Diary"" or some things like that,""suspense"" etc...But for my first book in English its so cool. Any way,I want know what happening after that. Will she change or not? This book is good for some people because they feel the same.I hope Esperanza changes her life but she has to do it for herself,not wait for somebody . So,dont wait to read this book maybe you feel the same as Esperanza. :)"
2,The book wasn't that good.,"josh s. the house on mango streetThe book was alright. But it wasn't the best or one of the best books I've read, I tend to like Stephen King and horror stories better. There was one good vignette called The Monkey Garden, the reason it was so good was because it dealed with everyday life and it was just a real good comparison with that garden and the Garden Of Eden and growing up. If she woulda applied that to other vignettes it woulda been a much better book."
4,"Sad and happy, depressing, but, uplifting.",Ciseros's The House on Mango Street is well worth the small amount of time it takes an active reader to peruse. Her detailed account of twelve year old Esperanza's view of life inspires even a middle aged woman (like myself) to find an outlet for your aspirations and dreams. Esperanza is a protagonist whose personal strength could inspire young women who are not expected to make anything of themselves. This novel should be mandatory reading for all teenage girls. I truely inspirational coming of age tale.
2,"""The House...""is a great vignette of a young girl's struggle","THE HOUSE is a great book. It tells of Esperanza's upbringing with sexuality, race realtions, and gender. Reading between the lines is unneccesary, for if you read and acknowledge the words, you'll understand Esperanza's story."
3,The House on Mango Street,"The House on Mango Street is a very deep and complicated book of vignettes. It is about a Mexican American girl growing up in the ghetto of Chicago. The girl, Esperanza, is faced with many different situations, each showing her maturity in unusual ways. As the book continues she runs from a man trying to kiss her, later the book shows her desire to be kissed by a boy she likes.Sandra Cisneros is Mexican American herself, which helped her create realistic characters. She used excellent dialogue that keeps your interest, while sometimes confusing you.The House on Mango Street is unique in its structure. The vignettes hop from completely different problems to completely different people leaving you feeling like you're trying to piece together a puzzle. One vignette is entitled ""Alicia Who Sees Mice,"" and another is called ""Bums in the Attic."" After reading this book, I was left frustrated, because I couldn't seem to put the puzzle pieces together."
4,The House on Mango Street,"I appreciated this book for how realistic it was to life of a young girl and how it displayed all her feelings in a simplistic way. I liked how it showed how Esperanza viewed life and the conditions around her, and how some questions were never answered (i.e. how old she is, the significance of the music box). I didn't find it a show-stopper book, though."
3,"Good but, Not Great","I did not really like the book, but the way it was written was a very good way to convey the information and overall picture the author was trying to get across to the reader. The small vignettes made for quick easy reading. I think the book would be appreciated more if it were read with no pressure of tests. I would recommend this book to middle school children and suggest they read it in their spare time it can be read in one sitting."
4,Half and Half on Mango Street,"The House on Mango Street is a good book, but confusing! At the end of the book everything comes together. I thought, while reading the book though, that some of what Cisneros' added was information that wasn't really needed. Overall, however, I thought the book had a good meaning and moral; you just need to get to that part! The thing I liked most about the book was the informal writing style. I thought it was easier to read and faster moving than most books. The vignette style also made it easier for me to follow. Cisneros is a good author and this book certainly shows it!"
3,It is a book that i sbeneficial in reading,"I like this book.. It is a bookwhich transpires with scent. It is also a book which is always beneficial in reading.Readers can experience a lot of life reasons from it.Therefore, I recommend students to read it."
4,drews review,i think that this book is really good because of the reason that this book has several messages to the reader. Like how you should not judge people by one's opinion also you should get to know people before you put a label on them. I really hope that more people read this book. So that it will teach them the things this book has teached me.
2,Bad for ESL class,"My community center uses this in its lesson plans for ESL classes. I'm a native English speaker, and I found the writing style difficult to follow! I asked advanced students later on about their level of comprehension, and they answered 10% to 25%. I was one of many teachers during the 2 week unit. It seems many teachers in ESL love to use this book, but I think there is some weird bias that leads them to choose this material. There must be better choices."
3,Talented Writng,"Esperanza is an immigrant living in the bad part of town. Through her eyes, you see her, along with many other characters, grow up. Because this book tells a story through vignettes, it can be confusing, but over all it's a good book. I had to read it for school, and it wasn't until we discussed it in class that I realized just how talented Sandra Cisneros is. Her writing is truly amazing! My class had to write our own micro-fiction pieces, and it is HARD!!! It's so hard to ""say things without saying anything"" and leave cliffhangers that never get resolved.Sandra Cisneros is an amazing writer, and I recommend reading it of you are trying to improve your skills. It's a great teaching book! If I were an English teacher, I would have my students read this."
4,House on Mango Street,This was a book we were assigned in my reading class where I am going to college. I enjoyed it so much i bought the audio CD so I could give this book along with the CD to one of my granddaughter's. The book is really good and the way it was written added a lot of flavor to the stories that she told. I would recommend this to any child or adult. Light reading and fun
1,never read this,"this is the second worst book i've ever had the misfortune to read.the other is too bad to even think about. This ""book"" makes no sense and is really draggy. The author must have been a bit under the weatherthe day she woke up and said ""I'm goinig to write a book of short stories that are in no order and don't make any point what so ever."" If you want to read a good book read something by JD Salinger or Agatha Cristiie. You just might stay awake."
1,The House on Mango Street,"I didn't like The House on Mango Street. I think the way it's written is weird and it's boring. I thought I was going to like it by the way it sounded and by the way it looked but I didn't. I thought it would of been interesting but it was below my reading levelThe House on Mango Street is about a girl who lives in a bad neighborhood and doesn't like her name. She wants to move to a ""real"" house away from Mango Street someday. The book tells about the people she meets and how she lives her life day to day. I think the only good part to this book was that it had a good moral at the very end.I wouldn't reccomend this book to people over the age of 10 or 11. I think it's a good book for fourth or fifth graders. I think anyone over the age of 11 would find this book kind of boring."
1,I am a reader who is very asleep after reading this book!,This book was the lamest piece literature I have ever read! Sandra must have wrote this book with putting people to sleep in mind. Its a very good bed time story I fell asleep after the first or second chapter! Please save your money and don't ever read this book!
5,Pure Poetry,"Perhaps the most moving and thought provoking book I have read in years, ""The House on Mango Street"" takes a harsh look at life in the slums of Chicago. Exposing the prostition of women, abuse by men, and ever-present need for escape, this work reveals new treasures each time I pick it up. A must-read for the serious book lover."
1,Terrible,I DO NOT recommend this book to anyone! I thought it was one of the worst books I ever read and it was not worth the time spent reading it in school!
1,Not very good,I am an avid reader and I found this book boring. There were only two things I liked about this book: (1)it dealed with a couple of mature situation and (2)it seems as the book was written by a child. It is unfortunate that I was forced to read this.
3,"Yeah, sort of","As soon as I figured out how to pronounce ""vignettes,"" I got well on my way delving into these little merriments. Cisneros does a phenomenal job of writing from the perspective of a child--I really couldn't believe it and often thought that she must have subcontracted kids out in a kind of child sweat-shop thing. Thank God for child labor laws.Ok, so there's been a lot of talk about this book as a window into childhood in a predominantly Latino neighborhood, but really, it's just another tale about a white upper-middle class childhood experienced vicariously through Eminem and video games--in general, the book feels like it lacks direction, and the only take away question from the book is which state school Esperanza will go to for college. Cisneros makes a successful stroke at reinventing our grammar system, but don't get hung up on the frilly-dillies."
2,This book was really beat!!,"I purchased this as like new, when I got it there is writing throughout. Some of the pages are ripped at the corners. I would definitely say, more like well loved!"
1,"I agree with the ""D.C."" reader","I totally agree with the reader's point of view from D.C on ""HOUSE ON MANGO STREET. I too think the only reason it became popular is because, she is hispanic and a female. The book and herself would not have been as respected if it was not for that, so I feel it was not that great of book! DANA F."
2,Forced to read this in school,"I was forced to read this in English class as a study in Latino culture. As I read the book, the writing style was very child like by telling a chapter indirectly so you have no idea what they are trying to say. I think my school waisted their money in buying this book. I have read much better books. If you are going to buy this book then buy a cheap used paperback."
2,good,I thought that this book was full of excitement and pizazz! I think that everybidy should read it.
3,Appreciate what is there....,"From all those reviews full of praise, I got the feeling that those people saw more than there actually is, like those trying to decipher a Dali painting; it can be appealing (I love Dali, and I enjoyed the childish simplicity in A House on Mango Street), and, naturally, not everything is accidental, but this book should be enjoyed without trying to attach too many theories to its content! Worth reading, especially since it's so short (a positive quality in this case!), but don't take it too seriously."
5,To reach and reach--a book about growth,"I have heard my peers comment that this book is suitable for a junior high level course and is void of any meaning whatsoever. However, in order to fully appreciate this work, you must look deeper into it and seek out things that are not so obvious. If read properly, the reader will see the stories contained in this book as the observations and experiences that are in a little girl's heart. The things that make the main character, Esperanza, a woman, are things that most of us look at once and forget about, assigning them little importance. Cisneros presents these overlooked items to us again and tells us to see how it is the simple things that make us who we are. A shallow person might overlook them, but these are the same things that make us who we are--the people who live down the street from us, the trees growing in the front yard. Give this book a chance and open your heart to it, and it will enrich you more than you ever could have expected."
2,The book is about what goes on during the life of a poor kid,It is a good book in terms of letting you know what it's like being a poor minority. However this is not a book for those who seek action.
5,She speaks to all women through a unique voice,"Esperanza is a tremendously intuitive young girl, and Cisneros does a great job of giving her the voice she so desperately deserves. A must read for all women and anyone who ever had to struggle for anything, however small. The power of this book is in its details and its overall ""coming of age"" theme. In short, it deserves to be read."
1,The House on Mango Street,"The book ""The House on Mango Street"" is about a girl by the name of Esperanza who lives in a house on Mango Street how ever they didn't always live in that house. Esperanza's family didn't always live on Mango Street, her family moved around a lot which was kind of the main problem in the book. Her mom and dad always wanted to own a big house with two bathrooms and real stairs but what they got was nothing like what they imagined. Esperanza was embarrassed of her house and acted very childish however later on in the book as she grows older she gets mature and learns to understand her family more. I didn't really like the book because it was really hard to understand and many characters where just being ""thrown"" in the story.Claudia H."
1,House on Mango Street,"What a disappointing selection for California's required Hispanic reading! This book is disjointed and written in such a juvenile manner that I thought originally throught it was just a very poor translation from the Spanish. While the concept is somewhat interesting, a Hispanic community in Chicago is harder for Californians to identify with. Why not a book about the Hispanic community ALL over Calfornia? More than the location though, I had trouble with the dull, repetitive tone of the book. What a snoozer!!"
2,House on Mango Street,"The House on Mango Street follows the coming of age of young Esperanza through a series of vingettes.Though some consider it the newest in great literature, I disagree. It is fairly off the wall and is not to be compared to the likes of Charles Dickens and Mark Twain. The lack of quotaion marks throughout the novel left me wondering if the author had graduated from grammar school. Another annoying feature of this book is that it has no continuity. The story simply jumps from place to place with no warning and is garranteed to give the reader whiplash. Call me old fashion, but I would prefer Oliver Twist to this novel any day."
3,It's worth reading...,"Sandra Cisneros' novel, The House on Mango Street is a series of short stories revolving around a girl living in the Chicago barios. Her name is Esperanza, It means hope in English, it means too many letters in Spanish. Esperanza and her family had just moved into a house that she doesn't like. She wanted a house like the ones on TV, with a real staircase and a big backyard. Each chapter is a new story about different characters and happenings around mango street. Esperanza tells her thoughts on friends, family, life, and her dreams. The book can be funny in parts, sad in others, and make you feel good in the end. Being such a short novel it is easy to read and can be enjoyed by all ages. The House On Mango Street gives hope to those who feel different than everyone and gives an importnat message: You should be proud of who you are."
3,Life on Mango,"What I thought of the novel was that it was pretty good; it was the first book I have finished in a long time. What I like about the book was it was a fast pace book and had a lot of description and a good story about the way Esperanza grew up and her friends and family . What I didn't like was that sometimesI got lost, but I would find my place and understand a little later on. The authors writing style was a little different then most books I reading the fact that she use short sweet chapters that told much in a little space. when I read the book it made me think of the way my cousins are. I would recommend this book to anyone that doesn't like to read because I don't, and I liked this book."
2,Disappointing Novel,"I personally did not like The House On Mango Street. Unlike most books, this book had no set plot. Each chapter had it's own little story. In the end you have to put together all the little stories to get the whole story.I thought this book was boring, and I would not recommend it to anyone"
4,THE HOUSE ON MANGO STREET REVIEW,"THE BOOK, THE HOUSE ON MANGO STREET, IS WONDERFUL, YET IT LACKS SOMETHING ELSE IN IT. HOWEVER, I DID LIKE THE BOOK. THROUGHOUT THE BOOK, YOU SEE ESPERANZA CHANGE AND MATURE INTO AN INDEPENDENT AND CARING GIRL. ESPERANZA GOES THROUGH BAD EMOTION AND GOOD EMOTION. THIS BOOK IS VERY INTERESTING AND THIS BOOK IS VERY UNDERSTANDING. PEOPLE OF ALL AGES CAN READ THIS BOOK AND UNDERSTAND WHAT ESPERANZA IS GOING THROUGH. THE HOUSE ON MANGO STREET IS A PLACE WHERE ESERPANZA FEELS LIKE SHE DOESN'T BELONG AND HOW SHE DOES BELONG."
2,The House On Mango Street,"Honestly, I didnt really like this book. The book didnt keep me interestedand it didnt give a real message such as A Child Called It. In a child called it every thing was explained in detail what happened through out his life was brought up in great detail, but in The House On Mango Street nothing was explained in detail. The one good part of the book was at the end when the last part of the book referred back to the beginning. It concluded the book well."
2,Too...Hard...too...Follow,"In this book of vignettes, Sandra Cisneros takes you through the poverty and troubles of growing up in a Hispanic-American section of Chicago. She will introduce you to the life of Esperanza. You will venture from her childhood and up until she becomes an adult.In The House on Mango Street, you will be confused throughout a lot of the book. You will have to reread parts of the book to understand what point Cisneros may be trying to get across. If you get this book, you might have to read the book two to three times to fully understand it.An example of a part you might get confused at is when Esperanza compares herself to a red balloon tied down. Another example is when Esperanza compares her family to four skinny trees. Where she is tied down by her roots.All in all, this book isn't for the simple minded. The main reason being is it will make you think! It would have been a more enjoyable book if it was not so hard to understand."
2,The House on Mango Street,"I read The House on Mango Street. It was alright. It was kind of boring and didn't keep my interest very well. It was somewhat confusing at times because the author does not use quotes and it is hard to tell when someone is talking or thinking. It was a bit interesting to see words being used that are in spanish because I knew what all of them meant. Again, I think this book was okay but I would not really recommend it."
1,Twee,"Rolling Stones guitarist Keith Richards, when asked what he thought of Gibbon's Decline and Fall of the Roman Empire, is rumored to have responded ""Subtle."" The description might be more reasonably applied to Cisneros' The House on Mango Street, which is a damn sight too subtle in my opinion. It is, as the previous review pedantically states, a series of vignettes. However, unless one is easily seduced by breathless prose and the kind of poetic resonance that is believed to swirl around descriptions which rely almost wholly on the reader attaching her own range of implications about character and setting to a few pedestrian facts, look elsewhere. For self-indulgence and wilful naivete, take Cisneros; for virtuoso writing combined with the excitement of plot and the interest of psychology look to Martin Amis or Michael Chabon."
2,required reading for last summer - daughter didn't like it,"My Daughter is an avid reader, but she didn't like this one much. It was a required reading for summer or something."
2,My Opinion,"What I thought of the novel was okay. It was a little interesting but yet boring at the same time. One thing I did like was the Authors style it was short but yet it revealed much detail. The reading did not affect me at all,but in the same way I could relate to her and some of what she is going through. But I cant say that any of the other charecters relate to me, but I can see what they are going through as well. I cant say that i would recommend this book to someone;it wasnt that great where I could say,""yeah its a great book;you should read it."""
4,My review on TheHouse On Mango Street,I think that the book was pretty good. I liked the fact that it has many diferent parts to it and that it doesn't get old. I thought that the authors writing style was excelent. The book really didn't relate to me because I have never really experienced anything like that in my life. The characters in the book are not simular to anyone I know. so in conclusion this book was very good and i would recomend it to someone that likes books like this.
4,Cyrus Sherm review,"The House on Mango Street was a fictonal story about a girl named Ezperanza. This story was not like ordinary novels, it was short, simple but ""filling."" I especialy enjoyed the book, because it was not boring what so ever and the author described activitys and people in the book so well. The book went at a very fast pace. Each chapter was a small story all to itself. I like that type of reading for school because when you go to take a test, it is fresh in your mind. unlike many other books, I noticed that most the kids in my class also did well with it. this book captures the escence of the characters life and to me, she interprits and instills you with clear pictures. this was a well and fun written story."
3,Growing Up in a Latino Community,"Sandra Cisneros, author of Women Hollering, Creek, My Wicked Wicked Way, and Loose Woman, takes us through her childhood experiences and growing up in a poverty stricken latino community in the Bronx with The House On Mango Street.The House On Mango Street is somewhat of a fictional biography. It vividly paints a picture in reader's minds, through the fictional eyes of Esperanza, of feelings and events that made up Sandra Cisneros's childhood.Overall, we were disapointed with this book. None of us were realy able to connect with the book or the characters, which made it hard to follow. If you are able to connect with and have an understanding of Latino culture, you would probably be able to enjoy this book much more than we did. In the end, this book earned 3 stars and although we don't consider it great, it is worth checking out."
4,The Big Picture,"Sandra Cisneros has used a style that is easy to read and understand. She chose to use vignettes to tell the story. She caught my attantion in the first few pages. The book is filled with hints that lead to the big picture. The main character, Esperanza, deals with issues such as maturity, friendship and sexuality. She grows from a young immature girl to a mature young adult. She learns to understand her surroundings and how to adapt to them. Eventually, she also learns to utilize them. Each story is somehow connected to another, so the reader must stay focused and put the clues together."
3,A well written book,"""The House on Mango Street"" was a very well written and articulate book. It related to me on so many different levels and took me back to when I was Esperanza's age. Even though we didn't go through the exact same things I remember being that age and experiencing new things. That age is an awesome age for picking things up and it's the time that you really develop your personality. Sandra Cisneros took her readers on a journey and really portrayed the world through a young girl's eyes.It was very descriptive and very imaginative. At times it was also very deep and surprising. All in all I would say that ""The House on Mango Street"" is a very good book and I recommend it to people of all ages."
2,A Book LIke No Other,"The novel House on Mango Street was not really the novel for me. Sandra Cisneros did a wonderful job in bringing Esperanza's story to life, but she did it in a way that was not very catching. The reason for me saying this is because Sandra has Esperanza tell her life story, but she breaks it up into sections that don't let the story go with its natural flow. For example, I was wondering why Esperanza went from talking about her house on Mango Street, to talking about the different hairstyles that her family has, and then to why her brothers would not talk to her sister and her. Sandra did this through the whole book, and I felt that this was not a great way to express the tale."
3,The House on Mango Street,"I think that The House on Mango Street was an okay book, but the chapters were too short. Every other page was a new chapter, and the story didn't flow. You never really get to know the characters because the story is so broken up. It is an imaginative book, with lots of color. Each chapter is almost like a short story on its own. The story skips, too. One chapter is about one thing, then a chapter about something totaly different, and then back to the original idea. The story almost sounds like an edited diary. Dialogue is mixed up, so in one chapter, a conversasion between three people happens. It can get a little confusing. All in all, it is a mediocre book. I probably wouldn't recomend it to anyone, though."
2,A review through the eyes of me.,"I am a high school student, and an assignment I had was to read ""The House on Mango Street"". Our teacher had given us some print outs of reviews of this book. The reviews she gave us all had just about the same story: The author of the review wasn't looking foward to reading it, but after reading it, he/she had thouroughly enjoyed it. That got my hopes up for the book. I thought that maybe since the reviewers had enjoyed it, that maybe I could too. I am not much of a book reader, so maybe that's why I didn't enjoy it as much as I had expected. I do agree that the chapters were short and easy to read, but at some points I just couldn't follow along. There were a lot of different characters in the book, and since the chapters didn't go together in anyway, it got quite confusing. I think that if I would have gotten to read the book on my own time, and without all the worksheets, I would have been more satisfied."
3,The House on Mango Steet,I didn't like this book to much because it was very hard to read and understand. Sandra Cisneros tried to write this book through the eyes of a child and she wrote how a child would write. Which is very hard to read and understand. In the chapter Darius in the clouds there is two people talking back and forth about the clouds and it is very hard to follow who is talking Nenny is giving them names of people she knows and rachel is telling what the clouds really are. They talk back and forth interupting one another and this is very hard to understand who is talking. This is just one of the examples of why this book is hard to understand. I think this book would of been alot better if Sandra Cisneros would of written this with correct grammar.
2,Mango Street,"I was not a big fan of this book. The chapters where to short and the way Sandra Cisneros wrote was hard to read and hard to understand. This perticular story was very informative and had lots of details but a lot of what she was describing I had absolutely no intrest in, or what she was wrote didn't intrest me. I know she ment to write the book like she was a kid writing it, and for that reason it didn't work for me. It just made me like the book less. The book was not long or boring but I didn't like it because I couldn't relate to the book. The things that happened in the book don't happen in my life."
2,The House that had love,"I was not a big fan of the book, but I did like some parts. The thing is that the book does not have a flow to it. The book just has short stories. This I did not like. It made me feel like I was a kid.The book was choppy. The vignettes were not a good thing. The vignettes made the book seem boring. The book never really went in great detail about the year or how old she was in each of the vignettes. The book was good in some points. One is the stories did show the truth of the life in a poor neiborhood. It also showed the kind of lives and kinda personalties that happen in a poor neiborhood.It also showed me how it was to grow up in a poor neiborhood."
1,The House on Very Bad Street,"Nooo! Don't! It's PAINFULL to read this book!It really is, believe me. Don't get it."
1,A book to be borrowed not bought,"The House on Mango Street is dedicated to 'las mujeres'. However, stories of the life of women (and the main character, Esperanza) on Mango street are superfluously written, punctuated with goofy stream of consciousness narration and misplaced metaphors. Seems as if Cisneros uses her Latino heritage as an excuse to write a book and does not manage to bring any of her characters to life."
1,DONT WASTE YOUR MONEY!!!!!,THIS BOOK REEKS. SANDRA EXPLAINS PIECES OF THE NARRATORS LIFE IN SHORT STORIES WITH NO END AND NO PIONT. AFTER YOU FINISH A CHAPTER YOU DONT EVEN KNOW WHAT YOU JUST READ. I DIDN'T EVEN HAVE THE PATIENCE TO READ IT IN ONE SITTING WHICH IS SAD SINCE ITS 110 PAGES LONG!!!
2,egh...,This book was honestly one of the most boring books that I have ever read. I believe that this was a boring book because of the fact that I didn't put any intrests toward any part of it. I do not recomend this book to you if you like excitment and actually like to read! Every page is literally 35 seconds long and just makes one feel as if I'm in elementary school.
3,Life in the slums,"This book really got to me. It showed how true life is not like all the other fantasy books that are read daily. The House On Mango Street was written in a childs point of view so it is fairly easy for kids to understand, even adults can relate to the way Esperanza feels as she is growin up. The way that she seems like she is the only one who feels that way that she feels, and if she was in charge everything would be good and enjoyable. Esperanza begins to relize how life really is as she grows older. She understands in a way why things are the way they are and you can only do your best to make it good, you cannot control all the other people in the world. overall i though this was an ok book, but real strong in showing the life of a child, especialy those who are less fortunate. I would recomend this book to anyone and everyone."
4,"A fairytale of 20th century within satire, irony and paradox","Nobody's wife, Nobody's mother.Such a kind declaration remind me of the author's identity.Anyone who want to read this book, please make have a chance""Open Eye"" .. of course this recommendation for the male likeme.Even though the form, and style of this book seems to be childlish, but what the author concentrates in this bookis really sad, mournful story,, but the author does not fall into depression, she is just, vivid and respectful survivor and declarer of our times."
5,Oklahoma Tough,Required lots of research. Glad this information will be available for future generations.g
2,Exercise Loops,I was disappointed in these. I ordered a light and medium tension loop and there wasn't much difference in the two and neither one had all that much tension as compared to other brands I've used.
2,Visible seam,This band isn't physical therapy quality - you can see the seam. But for the price it seems like it will be ok.
2,Don't expect too much,"What's sad about this CD set is the narration, the information, and several of the interviews are very good - but there are no use of maps to more clearly see what happened in most of the battles. As the viewer you are near completely reliant on your listening skills as the battle footage makes little sense - and in some cases doesn't really follow along with the narration all that well. I recall seeing Corsair carrier footage while they were documenting the battle of Midway? The CD set isn't a total loss, as the information is very well put together, but they fell short on the editing, the footage, and the background music for sure.It is obvious that they spent a long time putting this together - I hope that they update the CD set and make it better."
3,OK on 4 of the 5 discs.,"As the only other reviewer (so far) has said, the first 4 of 5 discs are what was expected and pretty good. However for the last disc, on the case they list ""Acts"" or chapters titled things like ""The great turkey shoot, Last chance of the tin can navy at Leyte gulf, Halseys blunder, etc"", while the disc actually has ""Floating chrysanthemums, Where are the japs, The generals blunder, etc"" covering the invasion of Okinawa versus battles near Leyte gulf. I got this hoping for more of the info on the sea ship battles versus land invasion stories, so I'm not totally happy. With more than 1 person saying the same thing it sounds like someone punched a wrong button and didn't catch it before hitting the ""Go"" button on the production run, so beware."
1,Complete disaster,"The box art should tip you off. An Army P-40 at wavetop altitude with guns blazing beside some unidentifiable warship. The video is equally incomprehensible, spotty narration with anachronistic footage, dwelling on some battles while ignoring other important ones. The scenes do not remotely match the chapter index and will confuse the eager student and exasperate the knowledgeable expert. South Pacific footage illustrating the Aleutian campaign, even the famous footage of the B-24 hit by flak over Germany to illustrate Midway. A hopeless mess created by non-enthusiasts who apparently understand nothing about the Pacific war."
3,"ehh, mixed feelings","Although im not heavily into metalcore anymore, i put some listens in this album. While definately not bad, it couldve been better. Howard Jones's original band (for those of you that think he was in KSE first), they play a heavy high-intensity dissonant style of metalcore that is thick slow and crushing at times and blasting away at others and still yet throwing in melodies at the right times, and they do it well. One of my few problems is the vocals. Howards raw vocals are well, annoying at times. He has good range, but sometimes overdoes it. I do not like previous releases by the band, but this one definately puts them on the map, because they blow away most metalcore."
2,"Heavy for sure, but boring after a while...","Well I'll agree with the rest of the reviews, it's definitely heavy and aggressive. The only thing I don't like is the stop start Meshuggah sound to them - it really gets old after a while, and you can't get moving to it. That's just me though - if you like stop start beats this is the hardcore CD for you :-)"
1,Utter Crap,This album is horrid and terribly boring. There are a million bands who play the same kind of music as BHBS and most of them are much better. This cd gets on my nerves. I gave it many chances but it never got any better. I threw it in the garbage can. I rule. Stick to KSE Mr. Jones.
1,It SUX,"this is one of the crappiest bands out there. i have heard people vomiting and kicking car parts that sound better than this. it sucks, hard"
4,"""When Your Tied To Your Feelings""","This -2 track- single CD is a nice little addition to have in your Lacuna Coil collection. It's worth the purchase price just for the acoustic rendition of 'Swamped' and the very nice cover picture of Cristina Scabbia, one of the best voices and best looking female vocalist in Goth metal!"
1,"If there was a half star to pick, I would have.","I can't say I never wish this book had been written. It is because of this awful piece of literary garbage, that one of the most beautiful films in history was created. Whoever wrote the script gets five stars. The book presents you with no hope at the begining, and leaves you with no hope at the end. The movie, on the other hand, gives you little signs that maybe Gilbert will be ok. People need that sort of thing. What is the point of a story that creats no emotion at all. I wasn't even sad. This Hedges (guy) should work in a library, maybe he will learn a thing or two about good stories."
4,bumpy and uneven,"I did see the movie first, so knew what I was getting into, but not that i would be simultaneously surprised and disappointed. The writing at times was brilliant, but some sentences stuck out like a rotten tooth, disjointed and ugly. I will read his second effort, mainly just curious to see if his writing style has amalgamated from stop-go into a steady stream of shazam."
5,Awesome.,"Never been out to the mid west, but now I get a glimpse of what living there might feel like."
5,The best book I have ever read.,"This book touched me in a way that I never felt before. It truly illustrated with graphic description the way life is in some small towns. The story of the Grapes is awe inspiring, and I have never read another book quite like it."
5,A great book!,"If you have not yet read ""What's Eating Gilbert Grape"" I envy you because you get to read it for the first time. It is one of the great books of our time. It is very complex and contains really effective symbolism, yet it is also very, very down-to-earth. If you are 12, or 22, or 32, or 92, this book will be full of meaning to you. It is about the death of the small town, a troubled family, individualism, and many other themes. It is simply one of the best, if not the best, book I have ever read. The movie is also excellent."
5,Vico C simply the best!,"VICO C BRINGS A NEW STYLE TO THE RAP MUSIC: HIS OWN! HIS LYRICS AND RYTHIMS ARE ON THE TOP. CON PODER MEANS ""WITH POWER"" AND THIS IS A EXACTLY DEFINITION OF HIS WORK, SIMPLY THE BEST!"
2,Booooorrrring,"To all who may have the seen the BIG tour for '04 - the acoustic set was a bore. The rest of the show really rocked. This DVD is just like the show , only worse. The banter between the Yes guys was totally scripted and they said the same little jokes every night and it's the same on this DVD. This DVD is only for the most DIE-HARD Yes fan (thought I was). I'm sure you can find one cheap on Ebay."
2,Wrong item. Way over priced.,"They sent a Venture truck instead of Indy. Also, I thought the price was for 2 trucks. Wrong! My bad for not paying attention."
3,One truck!,"I purchased this item thinking I was getting a set of two trucks at a great price. Imagine my surprise when the package arrived and only one truck was in it. Instead of a great price for two, I was paying way too much for one truck. Mind you, Independent make some of the best trucks out there, and the product itself deserves five stars. However, you can definitely find better prices at other online stores (sold in PAIRS, too!)."
2,Poor quality ...,The seat cover attracts all kinds of lint and dust. It's not thick and the quality was not near as good as I expected. It's already spreading at the seams in certain parts and has barely been used. I guess you get what you pay for ... the one good thing I can say is it did fit the bucket seats in a chevy S-10.
2,"A fulff piece, with a little useful history thrown in","If you are looking for a balanced review of the nation's largest pharmacy chain, you need to look elsewhere. It is useful as a general history of the chain, especially the family connections. However, it is not an objective or balanced work. It reads, especially in the portions covering the last 20 or so years, like a piece written by the PR department. No negative views are presented, though I know many current and former Walgreens' employees who would beg to differ when it comes to working conditions and pharmacy professionalism. I will use some of the material in my History of Pharmacy class when I discuss the rise of the chain stores, and the various approaches taken towards this goal, and for that, this is a decent resource."
2,Nothing really new,"I guess if you don't work for Walgreens there would be some interesting anecdotes in this book for you to read. It looks to me like the author took the ""Daily Dose of Dave""s and edited them all together in book format. If you've work for the company for a few years then you've probably read a lot of the stuff here already through Mr Jorndt's weekly bulletins. It's more a biography of Charles Walgreen than a look into the company. I would find someone else who owns it and ask to borrow their copy rather than buy it. Not recommended."
4,"not bad, not bad","eh, its pretty good. I was very impressed with the samples on the site, and I love Radiohead with an undying passion, so I got it. The only problem is that it gets old after a while. Or at least it did for me. And he did a few things that I didn't like, such as mess around with let down to make it sound stupid. And theres one chord too many in airbag so it ends badly. Otherwise, the guy is an amazing pianist and the cd's good. I still say you should definately get it if your a diehard radiohead fan, but if your just a lukewarm fan, dont get it unless your really into piano. I guess also get it if you're one of those panzies that likes the music but can't deal with ""Thom's voice"" and ""all the angst"" blah blah blah. Or you could get over it."
4,Very good,"You have to give this man credit. It is very hard to cover Radiohead's music and not make it sound like you pulled it out of your ass, especially when cover the music with a single instrument. I don't care what those babbling purist idiots think, I think this man pulled it off, and very well too. The only thing pulling me away from giving this album 5 stars is that it still isnt radiohead. Something's missing without Thom's voice, yet it is still a very good album in the least. This man just took the things he loved and put them together on this great album. If any of you people had musical talent, I'm sure you try cover their music too. I would and you know you would too. Forget what those idiots say on atease.com, this albums good tribute"
5,"Radiohead fans will love this, Classical music fans, eh... It's Bittersweet","The host of 'From the Top' is interesting and funny. This CD is an interesting interpretation. I love classical music, and I am a Radiohead fan. I have to say this CD will appeal mostly to the later. If you are a fan of Chris or his show, you might like a copy in your music library, sample it first before buying. If you are a radiohead fan -- buy this CD."
5,Kudos. . . O'Riley,"Have you ever purchased an album out of pure impulse?Have you ever purchased an album knowing that, beyond a shadow of a doubt, it would turn out to be one of the most valuable investments you would ever make?The later was pretty much my story.I'll be blunt: I never did find Tribute Albums or Covers to be appealing. Especially since I absolutely Love Radiohead. But O'Riley did more than justice for this album. Bought it today. Listening to it now. Beautiful is an understatment.Songs To Look Out For:-Everything in its right place-Let Down-Exit music (for a film)-BulletproofBuy it. Even if you're not a casual classical listener."
3,"Muddy Yes, but what the heck!","Lettin' it all hang out there with his classical renditions of some truly magnificent songs by Radiohead...They're not necesarily better than the originals...how could they be? ...But what the heck...kudos for going for it...Maybe the next effort won't ride the sustain pedal quite as much...Oh, and if you're reading this Chris, ease up on the left hand a little...you're killing me with the filler... ; )"
5,Worth a listen!,"I think one needs the music to appreciate the playing here (available). O' Riley doesn't always play exactly what is written, but is convincing nevertheless. Knives Out has such a poignant beauty, and True Love Waits is equally haunting. The original songs are often quite different, but I see no reason why both vocal and piano versions can't be enjoyed on their own terms. This is an ideal CD for listening in a car on a very long trip. The ear requires several repetitions of these intrepid arrsngements to see exactly what is going on. Ultimately, a ""desert island"" CD for me. Anyone that cares about the limits of piano technique and utter pianistic beauty simply must give this a listen!"
1,too much pedal,"I read the review of this CD in the NY Times and finally looked it up on Amazon. I have no interest or knowledge of Radiohead but this seems like an endless stream of ""romantic/ new age clichés. The samples were enough for me and I 'm grateful I didn't have to waste my money on the Cd. With all the great piano music written on the last - 60 or so years post Romanticism this is hardly a step forward. He may have great finger technique but his pedalling make everything sound the same-a syrupy, blurry mess."
3,A commercial ploy,"This has already been done (Radiohead transformed to classical music) and the strings version is far superior. Bill O'Riley ruins several Radiohead songs by turning morose dirges into upbeat tunes. This is blasphemy to a devout Radiohead fan, but a classical piano enthusiast may enjoy it."
1,Great in theory. Doesn't work in practice,"We might admire a noble tribute to one of the great rock groups of our age, but Radiohead's sound simply can't be expressed by a solo piano. The best part of Radiohead's music is the tone established with novel textures, electronic sounds, and production techniques. The vagueness and pliability of these nontraditional instruments can express complicated rhythms and dissonance with a haunting tone that's relevant to the digital world. The piano conveys a classical, natural tone and produces discrete notes which overemphasize all the subtleties. Where Thom's slurred lyrics flow and swagger through the melodies and, O'Riley's piano marches and plonks.Though this CD does offer the listener a different interpretation of the music, most of the quality is lost in the translation."
3,Just shallow,"I like Charles Band's movies, but this is like an extended featurette of Full Moon. Very shallow and not enough information, but have some nice advices (that you can get better in books)."
3,"Good for show, bad for play","I consider chess to be the best and most ingenious game ever created. But that doesn't mean that I consider every set good. This one cost me over $100 and the price was reasonable because the set is marble. And as an embellishment it's doing its job well. However, the set isn't practical if one is an avid player, as I am. It's just too expensive and the pieces aren't comfortable to navigate. I recommend saving the money and buying a wooden set instead. There are very beautiful ones that will serve to decorate your home and be useful for playing."
2,Not that great!,"If you are needing significant humidity. This device will not produce it. I grow mushrooms and was using this device in a mini greenhouse (small). It has been sealed all the way around and has very minimal air leakage. Standing alone the humidity is maintained at 60%. The device did raise it to 70% and would hold but I need at least 80 to 85% humidity. Maybe, I was expecting to much...I don't think so. The item was hyped and failed to produce the results. Plus... you could make this thing yourself with a quick trip to Ace Hardware and about $5.00!"
1,Not impressed,"I was not at all happy with this product. Besides having to buy a pump separately, this did not put out nearly enough humidity. I have a rainbow boa and he ended up getting a respiratory infection because his tank was so dry. My fault because I should have had a humidity gauge in the tank sooner. I kept it going hoping that it would do SOMETHING in addition to my daily misting and moist substrate but nothing.... I filled the humidifier with water when I bought it and it took 4 months before I had to add more water. I was expecting to fill it at least once a week with the humidity level I needed. Maybe its ok for plants but NOT for high humidity reptiles."
3,Parts Sold Separately,"I haven't used the pump yet, but it just came in the mail. It would be great if the description had told me that the stupid thing needs an air pump bought separately to actually make the thing run."
2,well...,spend a few extra dollars and get a real humidifier i lived in florida at the time i used this and it still didnt do half the jobit should have
2,Bad shipping Now with rust,"Okay so this item was shipped to me in it's original box with a shipping tag slapped onto it. Any protection for the product while it ships? NO.So I decide to forget about it as long as it works that's all that matters. Right? WRONG! After about 5 days of this being plugged in the adapter on the lids of it that you connect to the hose starts rusting, clogs up the hose and doesn't allow any air to pass. So I open it and clean the adapter off screw it back in and replace the hose. Does this help? NOPE. Now this new hose is clogged and has turned orange from the rust in just two days. ALSO water gets into the hose and bubbles. I did not shake this product of fill it to much and ever since pouring the water into it, it has sat on a desk that is never touched. So why did this happen???? Wish I had pictures so I could post links to them. Any one else have these problems?"
3,Could have been brilliant,"This film had all the potential in the world but it just barely made it to very good. The good points: Great story, Kate Winslet (she always surprises me), the boys who played the brothers (especially Peter), Julie Christie, lovely sets/costumes. The bad points: shmaltzy, overblown music, the director's need to ""Hollywoodize"" the whole beat of the film, the sentimentality of the script. Neutral point: Johnny Depp (I always want something more from him but he only barely delivers.) This film is worth seeing especially if you like tear jerkers but it could have been so much more.Too bad."
3,What are Dreams made of,"The world of imagination as created by Sir James Matthew Barrie is solidly entrenched in both children books and in films such as ""Finding Neverland."" Viewing the superb acting talents of Johnny Depp, portraying the 19th century English writer J. M. Berrie, is tantamount to watching a great artist at work. The film laces Barrie's life before, during and after meeting his wife Kate Winslet, with the Victorian views of the day. What is glossed over or at the very least dissipated by the delicate film are the circulating rumors, societal suspicions and vicious gossip regarding Mr. Barries' real reason for marrying the matron widow and her attractive family. The film proves witty, incisive and stocked with family values seldom found in other movies. Anyone seeking a glimpse of turn-of-the-century England will enjoy Depp's performance as he reveals the inspirational origins for his memorable story of Peter Pan. **"
2,"Nice acting, but not much else","This movie was not particularly watchable for me. The acting is great by the leads, but the whole concept of ""the real story, only with some facts changed"" as well as the whole magical realism feel to it just did not appeal to me. Sorry, can't recommend this."
2,Actually quite boring,"I read many glowing reviews on this site and others. These reviews were very eloquent, almost suspiciously so. I have always wondered if the studios pay people to write reviews on online sites. This movie strongly confirms this suspicion. I can't believe I am seeing the same movie these people watched. I was barely able to sit through the whole thing. It is just too slow and predictable."
3,Not quite as good as its cracked up to be,"I went into this movie expecting it to be very cheesy and very sappy. To my surprise, it was neither of the two. Unfortunately, I also thought it might be a little boring and I was right on that assumption. I had a hard time getting into the movie until about halfway through. Depp, Winslet, and the children were all very good in the movie. There was a definite chemistry between the actors that came across. The best part of the movie is at the end when Winslet goes to Neverland. That's really, to me, the only stand out scene in the movie. The story was a little sad without being depressing or draining. It was funny without being over the top, and it was thoughtful without sounding like a Hallmark commercial. It wasn't bad, but I don't think I'll be rushing out to buy it."
5,Great Movie,i just finished watching finding neverland. I thought the movie was very good. Johnny Depp gives a great performance as the late James Barrie. this is definitly one of the best movies i've seen this year. I'm waiting to see how Alexander turns out and a few other movies to finally decide which movie is at the top. Ray was also very good. Jamie foxx's preformance comes very close to Johnny Depp's in Finding neverland. it'll be a hard decision on oscar night i can tell you that.
5,Love this movie....,"It's a total chick flick, but who can resist Johnny Depp. It's a movie I can watch over and over again. This movie helps you escape from all stress and reality in life if only for two hours. A must own in your DVD collection."
5,***** Extraordinary Performances by All *****,"I have loved this movie for years, and I also have loved sharing it with friends and family. Having recommended it a year or so ago to a wonderful couple that are friends of mine, but hearing for over a year that although they added it to their Netflix queue, it still had not made its way to the top..., I decided to send them the DVD as a gift. This was their response after they watched it:""We loved ""Finding Neverland""! Thank you so much for the DVD. I have a renewed appreciation for Johnny Depp (love how he foreshadowed his famous pirate role in this movie) and Kate was extraordinary. But the kids' performances also really blew us away. I looked over at Robert during the scene where they recreate the play at Sylvia's house, and his face was all wet and he was having trouble breathing. Hmmm. There must have been an allergen in the air.""-- Needless to say, my great taste for quality cinema won the day again!"
5,"Excellent, touching movie","Great acting and writing. This is not a documentary on the author of Peter Pan, but rather an artistic interpretation of the essence of his book and it's message. It's so great to see Johnny Depp in something that's not Tim Burton-weird. He really is a great great actor, as seen in this film. Kate Winslet is wonderful as well, as the mother. loved this movie."
5,DEPP IS AMAZING!!,"step inside the wondrous imagination of ""peter pan"" playwright J.M.Barrie as his friendship with a special family inspires him to write his greatest work.DVD includes deleted scenes with optional commentary, outtakes, a ""creating neverland"" featurette and much more.all characters were played to perfection in this great film, definitely one that the family can watch and enjoy together!"
5,"Johnny's in control, another GREAT performance","I have a particular interest in the development of Johnny Depp's career; the man has shown genius for so long (Edward Scissorhands, Ed Wood, Sleepy Hollow), but he really went over the edge in ""Pirates"", and suddenly he's a force to be reckoned with. Johnny Depp is the best of our current crop of actors working today. The man has control, insight and tremendous ability to entertain, as the situation sees fit. After the crazy performance in ""Pirates"", Mr. Depp gives a subdued, thorougly complete rendition of J. M. Barrie's life during the creation of Peter Pan. Very fine performances from Kate Winslet, Julie Christie and a bunch of really good kid actors made this a wonderful film experience; a feel-good film that's intelligent enough for kids of all ages. A young (20's) female friend of mine thought it was dumb. As a 50+ male, I can relate, especially since I'm amused at the idea of ""Peter Pan Syndrome"". I hope I never grow up."
5,Charming. Tender. Fanciful. Sweet.,"No one walks the fine line between reality and fantasy with more charm and twinkle in the eye, than Johnny Depp. He is never overstated or obvious. Rather, he is fanciful, whimsical, impishly smiling and wise but not patronizing or insincere.Depp is sincere. Whatever moment he portrays - Johnny Depp always plays it sincerely.While there were other strong performers in this movie (Kate Winslet, Dustin Hoffman) they don't matter nearly as much as Depp. This is another world-class performance by one of the best actors of our day. Johnny Depp carries this film from beginning to end - much like Pirates of the Carribbean.A boy at heart, John Barrie does the impossible - he maintains his footing as an adult, successful playwright and husband while exploring the boy within. Whimsical and tender, Barrie encourages and provokes his youthful acquaintances to ""only believe"". The tale of Peter Pan was never more finely told.This is a charming film, worthy of watching."
5,Amazing Film!,"This film is a true gem. It is a slow and dramatic account of the adult life of James Barrie. It is very sad, beautiful, and shines as one of the best productions of 2004.It is not a chick flick. It is very neutral, and can be enjoyed immensly by the male and female audience.See this, you will be impressed."
5,A classic must see,"By pure chance, I happened to catch 'Finding Neverland' sneak peek. I highly recommend it. It is such a 'pretty' movie. The Neverland sets for J.M. Barrie's play are enchanting and completly catch you up in the magic of it all. The acting is wonderful, a definate audience connection. Johnny Depp is brillent and Kate Winslet adds such a soft strength. The children were perfect and the whole film thourughly inspirational."
5,Extraordinary,"At a time when there are so many films, that after watching you wonder, why was this made.....Finding Neverland was a gem! Long after you finished watching this film, it had a way of ""sticking with you"". The acting was wonderful, the story well written. Rather than the common insult to the intelligence, that our country accepts happily, this film assumes that the viewer is thinking. Loved it!"
3,Finding Neverland,"Wonderful portrayal by Depp as J. Barrie and Kate Winslet, awesome. The movie plodded a bit at times for me, but it really got me to appreciate the story behind Peter Pan. Interesting."
5,Fantastic Story,"My five year old son loves the story of Peter Pan. Seeing this movie depicting the creation of the play ""Peter Pan"" and putting the Pan story into a real world context opened his eyes into the power of imagination. Outstanding cast, great story line, A WINNER!"
2,Losing Neverland,"Disappointing movie. Depp's performance is wooden, Winslet reads her lines, Hoffman is simply putting in time. There's a complete lack of wonder and fantasy in this presentation of a tale about the creation of Peter Pan, Captain Hook and the lost boys. There should be magic. Instead there's a businesslike treatment of how a playwright developes a stage play. Boring."
3,Was expecting a love story,This movie is sort of depressing but it was well written and had great scenery though I felt unsatisfied with having watched it. Maybe because it wasn't what I expected and because the characters future was left uncertain.
2,No,I want to just rate this item giving it a certain amount of stars but Amazon won't let me do that anymore. I have to put in these meaningless words too. Thanks Amazon!
4,Finding Neverland,Superb flick. We decided that we should own it & now we do. Interesting exam of the author of Peter Pan. We recommend it highly
1,I Didn`t Really Like It,Nt Very Good At All.And Its Not Interesting.I Doesn`t Make You Want To Learn More About Neverland.Don`t Buy This Movie.
2,Duhhhhhhhh......,"Finding Neverland is one of the most overrated movies of this year, other than the slab of garbage that was 'The Polar Express'. I ususally love Johonny Depp. he was cool in Ed Wood, and POTC. But this movie kinda sucks. Kate Winslet isn't even as hot as she ususally is. The story is stereotypical and contrived. Right from that awful park scene, you know what will happen. Depp's carachter will befriend the kids, then Winslet will die. Go see Ocean's 12 or Meet the Fockkers instead of this. Overrated an' slow."
1,Never Never see this movie,"wow, what boring crap. the movie had no good plot at all, there could of at least been a real neverland. the accents were so annoying as well."
1,BORING!!!,"This movie is sooo boring, and it doesn't even have a plot! All it does is show them using their 'imagination' and eating dinner and stuff! Talk about BORING!!!!"
1,Stupid name & stupid movie,"Who would want to find Neverland, just so they can never grow up like Peter Pan what a childish name for a movie. Johnny Depp is too good to be playing in boring movies like this."
5,New Favorite,"This is my new favorite Johnny Dep movie. In fact the whole movie was beautifully cast, in my opinion, and it is a fitting tribute to the writer of one of my all-time favorite movies, Peter Pan.The story was moving, humorous, and inspiring for all ages. My 15-year-old grandson immediately wanted to get a leather-bound journal and start jotting down his own ideas for stories; although the 6 year old thought is moved too slowly.We saw it twice at the theatre and can hardly wait for it to come out on DVD."
5,FINDING NEVERLAND,I just recently saw this film and it blew me away. To me it was one of the most touching and magical films i have ever seen. Johnny Depp and Kate Winslet did an excellent job in this movie.

5,best movie,this movie was great. me and my mom were crying for hours after the movie. Johnny and Kate were terrefic. The little boys were so cute... you felt like you knew them.... i strongly recomend this movie...but its mostly for kids ages 12 and up!!!!!
5,it's like finding your heart,"oh...waht a movie! I first rented this movie then just had to get my hands on my own copy. I fell in love with the whole story as well as the actors. I've loved Johnny Depp since his ""Jumpstreet"" days, but normally he plays these over the top rolls. Not this time, this time he's genuine and draws you into the story. Kate Winslet is my favorite acctress in all the world. She's magical and in ""Finding Neverland"" she doesn't disappoint. This movie captures you from the first moment and by the end you feel like an emotional wreck (but in a good way). I don't want to spoil this movie and give anything away. I dont' want to take away your first magical experience with this movie. Rent it or buy it, but you must watch it. The experience will follow you for a long time after."
4,Puppies and Ice Cream,"Although I fell asleep during the earlier parts of the movie, by the end I was choked up enough to make my girlfriend want to propose to me on the spot. Really guys, this movie is a great chance to show your ladies how emotional and vunerable you really are deep down inside, or at least to pretend so you can get some action. Finding Neverland is just full of heartwarming moments, cute little kids with British accents, and a love story that works without any sex at all (and probably because of it). Honestly, this movie is so nice, it makes Peter Pan, the play it's based around, look like Die Hard."
2,"Sorry, couldn't finish it, and","have to stop watching after 30 minutes. nothing actually attracted me to watch along and kept me from nodding off into the zzzzzland. sorry, anybody likes to drink lukewarm tap water? well, i just couldn't swallow it."
1,Bo-ring!,"I hated, hated, HATED this movie! It ate two hours of my life, cost me almost $9.00, and left me angry for having listened to the pinheads who recommended this drivel.Johnny Depp, in one of his worst film roles, mumbled his way through this exercise in tedium. I've enjoyed Mr. Depp in other roles, but the material here was lacking in, oh, maybe EVERYTHING necessary to be interesting. The movie plodded along and I mentally checked out after 20 minutes. Had I not been there with a friend, I would've left.The less said about this borefest, the better, but if you have any questions about what I thought of this waste of film, please re-read my first sentence. Also, if you decide to see this movie and can't tell who is going to die after the first half an hour, then you are in the minority."
2,A waste of talent and time,"Ok, I have been a Johnny Depp fan and supporter since the beginning. I love how he chooses quirky, offbeat, and interesting roles. What's Eating Gilbert Grape is among one of my all time favorite movies as well as Edward Scissorhands. Depp is consistently amazing and should be recognized for it. However, ""Finding Neverland"" is a pretentious waste of a film and the only thing that shines in it is the acting. Kate Winslet is good as the mother and so are the young male actors. The problem with this movie is it never gets off the ground. Believe me, I do not have a problem with movies that are slow, but this one never caught my interst.When I it was over, I did not really feel I watched a movie but more a blabber of sorts. If you are debating whether to see this, do yourself a favor and go see ""Ray."" It is by far the best movie of the year, with Jaime Foxx the best actor of the year. If you feel like a laugh, go see ""Sideways."""
1,A cure for insomnia,This movie is excruciatingly slow-moving. The pacing is glacial and not much happens...Even diehard anglophiles will do well to stay away from this stinker.
2,I thought Johnny Depp was perfection,"I understand that no one is perfect, and everyone has flaws, and I suppose every talented actor has his or her dismal film, and this one bored me to death. I have respect for Johnny Deep, in so many ways, however this film just wasn't for him."
3,Mediocre...Not Awful,"Johnny Depp plays a guy named James Matthew Barrie, who is a guy who writes plays, and not too many people like them. Later in the movie, he is claimed to be Peter Pan. That's really all this movie is about. I just have one question about Peter Pan...why is he always played by a woman?? Answer:I don't know. Maybe it just seems right, but not to me. Basically, this movie had barely anything to do with Neverland. Even though that is the case, there is one scene where Kate Winslet is shown Neverland. That's about it, and they talk a whole lot about stuff like it and James Matthew Barrie was saying to ""Believe"" at the end. I didn't think this was awful. Only alright. It's worth seeing."
3,"A little slow, but got there in the end","To be honest, I couldn't get into this at first. It did take some time, but I kept perservering because I had heard that it was excellent. I agree that it was good but not excellent. I did shed a tear or two though, and the main little boy was amazing. He's so talented beyond his years. He'll do many big movies to come. As for Johnny Depp - he was very good and so was Kate Winslet. Yes I liked this, but just not as much as anyone else. Out of 10 I'd give it a 6."
3,Conversations difficult to understand,Clarity of speech needs to be improved say our guests who viewed the DVD with us. I agree. Volume had to be boosted significantly.
4,"Fantasy vs. Reality: sad, but Fascinating film","Finding Neverland (not Michael's place) is an interesting journey. As always, Johnny Depp is perfect. However this movie is not all fun and games, and refusal to grow up. A sadness lurks in the shadows, and leaves me wanting to watchHook, again to liven things up.Great movie, but contains drama as well as humor. You may teer up a bit, though the laughs prevail."
5,Neverland,"I grew up hearing Mary Martin sing the Neverland song on the soundtrack to Peter Pan, so this one is deep in my bones. When I was a child I saw the play Peter Pan when a touring production came to my town, and I later read Barrie's original play and a book version of the Peter Pan story, and then of course saw the Disney version. I was always touched by the fact that Barrie donated the royalties to a particular orphanage, and I love seeing how that comes about in this film. We viewed the film as a family after it came out on DVD, and I bought the DVD for my husband for Valentine's Day because he liked it so much! He always likes Johnny Depp. I was particularly pleased that my husband did not feel manipulated or tearjerked in any way by this film. The performances of the children, Depp, and Kate Winslet are all honest, sweet, quirky, and true, and what needs to remain mysterious does remain mysterious, and what needs to open up into the imagination does so seamlessly! Charming film!"
5,"great acting, great story","This is an autobiographical story about James M. Barrie andhow he came to write the play and novel ""Peter Pan"".It is also about death and orphans: the English, as Oliver Twist by Dickens points out, had trouble dealing with orphans.Barrie had a warm open heart and found a fantasy world for childrenthat appears to be timeless and universal.There is always a place in the heart of children for pirates, Indians and fairies.There is a real contrast in the emotional approach to death taken here and that in another recent movie:The Bucket ListI think that both have good acting by great actors,but one seems to be about the ""me first"" approach to lifeand this one is about living with death for both the livingands the survivors. I think that both are ""sentimental"",but this approach seems better."
4,Neverland has been found,"This is a great movie with a pretty good plot. It has the actor Jonny Depp from Pirates of The Carribbean. Which is one of my favorite movies, so naturally I took a look at this one. Actually I thought I would be bored. I thought it would be some boring thing on how he made Peter Pan. I was wrong. I am glad to inform you that this movie was not boring. It had some pretty funny imaginative parts where the playwright James Barrie would imagine adventuristic lands. So check out this movie."
2,Creeps predictably along,"As much as I wanted to like it, I found this movie bland and boring. Winslet is wasted, Depp mumbles along, and Dustin Hoffman phones his performance in. The boys didn't convince me either. The direction was flat-footed and had none of the wonder I was hoping for, given the subject matter. The music score is soppy and cliched, and the whole thing is shot like a Hallmark holiday TV special. A good idea for a movie that telegraphs its eventual resolutions about 20 minutes into the film; after that there's little point in watching. I kept waiting for some twist, some insight into their conditions, some surprise, but got none. I have no problem with ""slow,"" quiet movies a la Horton Foote, but they have to have some inner life that makes them special. This is very straight-forward, obvious drama, told with a lot of self-importance."
5,They may be onto something...,"Despite my cynical approach to the subject, these movies that champion the sometimes irretrievable quality of children just may be onto something. Though this movie does a tremendous deal more justice than those of Stephen King which touch on the subject in a roundabout way while having clowns kill you, monsters emerge from your rectum, vampires bite you, etc. (no, that's not a joke, you'll see the theme in It, Dreamcatcher, Salem's Lot, etc. not to mention his forays into drama).But back to the topic, do yourself a favor and watch the outtakes. I laughed harder to them than anything I can recall in recent memory.4.5 stars rounded up to 5."
1,BORING!,"Do yourself a favor and skip to the ending, that way you can get to the point of the story. The story is slow and boring."
1,BORING!,"This movie was so boring! Cheesy (like the little English kids would just start playing with total stranger Johnny Depp). They mumbled the whole movie, I had my TV loud and understood less than 5% of what was said! I was still waiting for a plot and something to happen and then it was over! Very sad, depressing and dissapointing ending. Glad I didn't waste money seeing this in theaters!"
1,I hope I don't find this neverland again.,"I'm surprised at these five star reviews. I found this movie to be boring and a complete waste of time. I couldn't even finish it, I had to shut it off because I couldn't take it anymore. I love Kate Winslet, but she couldn't even save this film. I think a lot of people are praising this simply because it's a Johnny Depp movie and they have a biased opinion. I wouldn't watch this again, nor would I recommend it."
1,Leaving Neverland,"BORING..All these five star reviews tell you how touching, and sad the end of the movie is. What they are not telling you is that you have to suffer through 90 minutes of pure hell first. I dozed off so many times that the end didn't touch me at all. For all you people suffering from insomnia, I found a great remedy. Pick up the self help DVD titled ""Finding Neverland""."
2,T Burger is Correct!,"The movie only fudged a couple of facts. Of course, sugar-coating omissions in this manner is acceptable to those hoping to paint a perfect portrait of J. M. Barrie. That said, upon reviewing Barrie's life and his relationship with the Llewelyn Davies children, many psychologists and psychiatrists view Barrie as a pedophile. I know, I know. It's all heresay, right? I was all heresay against Michael Jackson too, until someone couldn't keep the secret any longer."
5,It's like having a bird trapped in your chest,"I saw Finding Neverland tonight in a sneak preview. I wish I had words for it. Everything from the imagery to the acting to the overall everlasting, practical idealism just leaves you with a feeling of having a bird trapped in your chest, which can only be released by either laughing or crying. Everyone could use a dose of imagination in their life, even if it's just imagining the person standing next to you at the bus stop breaking out into a tap dance.I highly recommend this movie; as soon as it comes out nationwide, I'll be seeing it again. And as soon as it's on DVD, I'll be first in line to buy it. :-)"
4,Good One,We recently seen this and really enjoyed it. Another odd role for Johnny Depp...but always good for him.We enjoyed the imagination...and the dog. And a great storyline to go with.It's worth seeing if you get the chance
5,Touching and Much More,I was very touched by this film. It is much deeper than I imagined while viewing it. The images still remain with me. I think this is a great film because it touches the human heart and soul.
4,Don't want to grow up?,"The movie starts out a bit slow ... but as it builds and builds it embraces the audience. It is truly a beautiful movie, probably one of Johnny Dep's best. The portrayal of Barrie's journey to develop Peter Pan makes for an interesting and thoroughly touching story, even if it does occasionally wander into melodrama. Fans of Kate Winslet will enjoy her wonderful performance as Carrie's muse and Hoffman's role, though small, is hilarious. The movie basically plays up on the relationship he develops with 4 boys who play sons of Kate Winslett. They become his inspiration for writing Peter Pan. Even having said that, it can't begin to discribe how moving and touching the entire movie plays out. Johnny Dep brings out the kid in all of us. The movie has the perfect balance of humor and sadness"
2,ring of ?,ring of glory the only dvd release ever uh what to say its not that great it has some dumb matches and like 2 good matches rain vs jazz was decent for a womens dream match and 4 way ladder match was best match it is worth the cheap price that all i got to say so buy it for gods sake its only like 2 bucks and 3 shipping only 5 bucks u get 3 hrs cant beat that
4,Bachelor Party,"This movie had me laughing out loud the entire time, exactly what a bachelor party should be! It's a great comedy film with a twist, check this one out"
4,not bad for a solo start,"Considering how good Lloyd was with the Commotions, his first solo effort was always going to fall short. But don't compare this too much to that band's releases. On its own the first three tracks (""Don't Look Back,"" ""waht Do You KNow About Love?"" and ""No Blue Skies"" are all as superb as anything he did with the Commotions."
5,"Welcome, Lloyd Cole!","This CD stayed in my player for all of 1990 into 1991 and still gets listened to about once a month now! I thought I would wear it out! It hit me from the very first time I listened to it. The more I heard it, the deeper it got. Cole's 1st solo album had me thinking about music and life more than anytime else. His well versed and clever lyrics along with his vocals come together on this CD as a whole. The music compliments the words without taking over. A perfect balance. The CD flows easily from one song to another in a way that is masterfull. Not a 'dud' on the whole CD...a *very* rare thing!I cannot recommend this CD more. I have given it as a gift to many people...I haven't had a complaint yet!"
2,Lloyd Cole,I am sorry to say this CD jumps around .I have the same cd I have purchased some time ago With the same problem .I was hopeing I was able to replace it without any defect..Thank You anyway ..Vital
2,Looks good but too light to stay under gravel,"Looks good but too light to stay under gravel, I am constantly re-setting these plants they float to the top. The base is a poor design, Iam going to tie heavy weights in order to anchor better."
4,Soundwave Returns with a Vengeance!,"Soundwave is a true classic and it's great to see him, once again, for sale in the U.S..He comes with two of this minions, Laserbeak and Ravage. The originals of these are sought after just as much as an original Soundwave. You cannot put a price on the memories returned from its purchase. The box displays very well also.The one significant difference is the cassette door. Unlike the original featuring recessed hinges, this one has protruding hinges. This is because the mold used for this version is a direct copy of a reborn Soundwave, known as Soundblaster. What is nice about this version though, is that the chest cavity can hold both Ravage and Laserbeak at the same time.Oh, for some reason, neglected from the manual are the instructions for sticker placement.Overall, I would say that for anyone who would like a close-to-original Soundwave, you cannot go wrong with purchasing this ""reissue""."
5,Soundwave,I'm so happy I found this toy. When I was five I always saw other children with it and I wanted it ever since. When I found it in Amazon.com I had to get it. I'm happy with the toy and also my son =D
5,Great toy,"Its a high quality toy, not the cheap plastic that you find the walmart toys made of. Its easy to transform and looks really good when it does. It seems true to the old school Soundwave complete with Ravage and Laserbeak that fit inside the cassette case.I gave it to my four year old a few days ago, and it hasn't left his hand since. Well worth the money."
5,FANTASTIC,"I couldn't put this book down. I was so enthralled. I suggest this be a movie. I am astounded how these two authors bring such detailed, captivating experiences together. WONDERFUL story. I am looking forward to reading more books by Judith Michael. Thank you for 'taking me away' to another world. :)I applaud this husband and wife team. BRAVO"
1,Reader in pa.,"I really enjoyed this book. It is about the seduction of power ,money and trying to recapture a youthful dream. Both the husband and wife are very selfish, especially the man ,but they finally discover the important things in life. I would like a sequel."
3,Nice to know you!,"What do Ruff Endz, Brownstone, Portrait and Cappadonna have in common? ...Give up? Their record labels released Greatest Hits albums when they only have two albums out. In other words, if Ruff Endz don't have a new deal RIGHT THIS MINUTE, then they can kiss their careers goodbye.Anthony Rupert"
4,Great examples of gourd carving in this book,"I'm new to the art of gourd carving and decorating and have found this book to be helpful for techniques and equipment as well as inspiring for new ideas and designs. I recommend it for your ""gourd library."""
5,Wonderful Resource!!,"I have been woodburning, painting and decorating gourds for about 5 years, and was looking to expand into carving. After reading the reviews on this book, I decided to give it a try and was amazed at the techniques demonstrated in this book. This books not only shows you completed projects, but also the tools and techniques to get to that end. It provided a wide array of procedures that I had never heard of or dreamed of. I would highly recommend this book to anyone interested in decorating gourds."
5,Excellent book!,"I have been working with gourds for almost a year and have several books on gourds, but this book tops them all. This is a beautifully done book with excellent pictures and good instructions on carving gourds. What I like the most is how challenging and inspiring this book is. After looking through it once, I have so many ideas about how I can improve my designs and techniques, even though it will take me years to achieve the same level of quality. I definitely recommend this book to those who want to take their craft to the next level!"
3,Round Peak Style Clawhammer Banjo - Brad Leftwich,"Here is another book where you listen to the authors playing and you get tabs that sort of resemble the songs being played. The tiny bit of instruction in the beginning lets you know you bought this book mostly to listen. Some interesting comments about the fretless banjo, but again, VERY little instuction and none really on the CD. At least, the author takes the time to match up the CD tracks to the tabulature in the book but all the songs are played at jam speed. On the plus side, the included CD is a good one to have. If you already know how to play clawhammer banjo you can learn a lot about Round Peak style and also pick up more than a few licks from this fat book and its 82 tunes."
2,Clawhammer,Was not what I expected. I took lessons for a while and I wanted to continue with the claw hammer style but this book did not follow with the style I had learned. Not that it isn't a good book. just wasn't what I wanted.
2,Hrmm...,"This book comes highly recommended by Round Peak style experts, and does a fair job at walking you through the mechanics of Round Peak style, but frankly, most of the songs included on the accompanying CD sound like variations upon a few themes rather than distinct songs.As I was going through the CD, I was struck at how many of the songs sounded the same. By the last track, I was extremely disappointed. It's a bit deeper than just surface-level similarities - in my opinion, this book covers about 5 ""themes"", expanded into about 30 ""songs"". In fact, you could probably learn the 5 themes and just improvise around the themes to get the same net effect.If you are looking to learn a banjo playing style AND some memorable songs, this might not be your best bet - this book doesn't quite deliver."
5,Memories,This brought back a lot of memories and I enjoyed the album very much. It is nice to hear songs that a person can understand
1,New Formula is NOT the same,"I used to use NyQuil for those nights you would be up all night coughing and it would ""knock me out"" so I can sleep restfully without the coughing or any other cold symptoms bothering me. The worst thing, when you are sick, is to not get any sleep at night. I bought some NyQuil because I have an awful cough and I need it so I can sleep and it has worked beautifully in the past. The new formula sucks. I had an awful night of sleep. It did almost nothing for my cough (I was still up coughing), I felt congested and had sweats/chills. It did not have that nice warm soothing feeling going down my throat and it did not ""knock me out"". The ""old"" NyQuil would have helped me sleep. I've very disappointed and need to find a new product now that will do what the ""old"" NyQuil did if one even exists."
5,best guy movie/love story I've seen in a long time,"Most would probably put this movie off as another TNA teen male movie (and I mean, it is that, don't get me wrong), but I like to think that even though it's glammed up to sell to guys eager to see some cinematic porn-starrish action, it's also got a strong message about finding love in today's society. Albeit with an ex-pornstar.What I liked about the underlying tone of the movie was that it enforces that love is an act of endless forgiveness, and if you love somebody, you're willing to fight for it. And not only does the main character fight for it, but he and his friends make you laugh your butt off with their antics, especially the trip to the adult film festival in Las Vegas.My biggest piece of advice when watching this movie is to have an open mind, because not quite everything in the movie is what you'd expect it to be. Would definitely recommend you be over the age of 18 to thoroughly embrace all the humor."
3,I liked it the first time better,"Nice movie but I liked it the first time when it was called ""Risky Business""."
3,A teenaged Romp in the Hay,"The Girl Next Door is the precursor to the highly successful Superbad. The film has a fomula feel to it. It features the ""nerd"" trio who seek sex before heading off to ivy league colleges; the madonna/whore good girl gone bad who is the nerd's object of desire; and a backdrop of stereotypes including good looking dumb jocks and oblivious parents.The film works on a number of levels. The actors all have fine comedic timing, and the plot, while corny, has enough interest and twists to maintain interest. Most importantly, the r factor (drugs, sex and rock n roll) will engage most males 15-19.A fun film."
2,Porn fantasy,"I watched this film because I know one of the actors who played a minor character. He did fine in his little part, but what a terrible movie! Believe me, this is not anywhere near as good or funny as Risky Business or American Pie, two fine and original teenage sexual comedies. None of the major characters is interesting, likable, or funny, and neither are any of the prudish grownups. It's more like a twisted teenage version of Pretty Woman, in which a serious and proper high school valedictorian ""saves"" a gorgeous teenage porn star - and manages to get filthy rich in the process! I can forgive a lot if it were at least funny. I hope my friend gets to act in better movies."
3,More sexually progressive than most teen comedies,"It's rare that I would go to see a ""teen comedy,"" and the completely ridiculous plot devices in this one reminded me why, but for a Hollywood movie it's surprisingly unhypocritical about sex. The movie had the chance to attack our culture's ""virgin(...)"" hypocrisy head-on (the fact that men buy porn, jack off to porn, but disrespect anyone who makes it.) Well, it wasn't quite that brave, but it did at least obliquely raise the issue by making Danielle a smart, cool chick who just happened to make porn and has to deal with other people's hypocritical judgements about it. The stars are sweet, hot and have good chemistry, and they live in an alternate reality where a sex-ed video that talks about foreplay wouldn't immediately be shot down by the Christian Right."
2,This film doesn't even touch american pie,"After I read the reviews on amazon, I decided this movie would be a good film to buy. Mistake! I honestly would rank this a B class film because of the bad acting, dialog, and editing. There is some good songs in the film but that is about it. Overall, a big disappointment save your money. It is hardly even worth watching."
3,"Some funny moments, but it could have been so much better","Despite the fact that critics pretty much dismissed the Girl Next Door, it's not half as bad as some have said, but the film's schizophrenic tone hurts it plenty. Is it a coming of age teen comedy? Or is it a teen sex comedy a la American Pie? We never know for certain, but the Girl Next Door is still fun to watch nonetheless. High school senior Matthew (Emile Hirsch) falls hard for his sexy new neighbor Danielle (the luscious Elisha Cuthbert), until he learns of her adult film past. Hijinks ensue, with two of Matt's friends along for the ride as he tries to get Danielle away from her producer/ex-boyfriend (Deadwood's Timothy Olyphant in a showboat performance) and the adult film world. It's funny to a point, but the film gets more and more unbelieveable as the film unfolds. Other than that, the Girl Next Door is worth seeing, and not at all as bad as many critics have said."
1,"actually, no stars!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!","a very poorly constructed film, specifically plot-wise. like a previous reviewer stated, it's a ""risky business"" rip-off. The characters are not believeable, even loathsome and arrogant, especially the young boy who falls for this girl next door. The kicker is that the actual ""girl"" in girl next door serves no real purpose, she could have been just a cut out poster of some talent-less actress/model babe, well, maybe she was...this is not worth buying, it's a sad retelling of Hollywood nonsense, basically saying that the love of a young male can curb the damged self esteem of a young girl who has made some adult films. I mean, we never learn WHY she did porn, WHY she is this person who she is, actually, we learn little about who she is as a person. a very flimsy film, do not rent, buy, or speak its name, tis pure evil."
2,THIS FILM IS FOR VIRGINS. NO OFFENCE,"C,mon. im fed up of these Teen Comedies. always about 'Oh I cant wait to have sex, I will do it today'. BASICly this film is for Boys that have never been wid a girl in their lives. The actors friend in the film goes @have sex with her for me please@ wots dat all abot. PERVERTISM. But then again its kinda funny"
4,Great teen comedy that deserved a better box office,"This was probably one of the most under-rated movies last year. It got shafted at the box office - in my opinion a result of poor marketing. From all the commercials on TV, the movie seemed like a brainless sex comedy. The studio really pushed the sexuality of Elisha. But this movie was so much more - great characters you actually cared about, great acting and great script. The Girl Next Door deserves to be included in the league of smart teen-coming-of-age movies."
1,All you need to know.,"She changes her ways and shows him how to live life to the fullest.There, i just saved you two long, boobless hours."
5,A Very Sweet And Cute Comedy About A Love Struck Hormonally Charged Teenager And A Porn Star!,"I think this movie is far superior to the vastly overrated American Pie and it's sequels.We have this very horny teenage Geek who falls in love with ""The Girl Next Door"" only to discover she is a porn star! What then follows is a very good mixture of Comedy and Drama which is quite a difficult recipe to achieve but this movie manages to ""pull it off""(no pun intended). Ms. Cuthbert is HOT and a delight to watch onscreen and I did wish I was 18 again and had a good looking young blonde girl living next door to me. Sadly I had to wait until I was 45 years of age before this happened. This movie is a Comedy Gem!"
4,This generation's BREAKFAST CLUB...,"I think this movie is bound to be a classic. Just like FAST TIMES, THE BREAKFAST CLUB, PRETTY IN PINK, etc... It is a bit more insightful and realistic than your typical teenager movie. In fact, it is miles better than most teen movies I've subjected myself to lately. Very enjoyable! I recommend this one if you need a laugh."
4,What are you taking about,"The critics ripped it up, and obviously many watchers missed the point. Though it is no Risky Business as many have stated I throughly enjoyed the movie. For anyone that grew up with the 80's classic High school comedies should enjoy it. Not enough substance? It's a comedy guys. It's to made to make you laugh, and bring back those long lost thoughts, and feelings of a coming of age high schooler regardless of what side of the fence you were on."
4,Really Disapointed,"I can only assume it was marketing that screwed things up for this film. For one, the title suggested to me when I first heard about it, another one of those teen flicks like ""she's all that"". I brushed it aside until one night I managed to view it. I was in awe of this film! Not to mention the music arangement. I loved it.. To me it was like a beautiful rendition of Risky Business and I pushed it on all my friends like a petty dope dealer to see this flick. I checked the theatres and found that after only ONE month from release, it was showing at the dollar theatre?! It's a classic!? I hope someone lost their job because of this. I will definitely buy this DVD and you should too. Nuf said..."

2,What a HUGE Disappointment!!!,"This movie had such potential, and unfortunately it didn't even come close to reaching the outer fringes of it.Not funny, at any point. I didn't even crack a smile, actually I never even smirked. I was expecting so much more.One positive...great soundtrack. Otherwise this movie is a complete throw-away!"
1,Horrible Teen Movie,"It was a while ago, but somebody came up with a painting that contained everything Americans like about art. The painting, as you would expect, is horrid (i.e. animals, little kids, sunsets, etc. all thrown into a jumble.) Well, this movie is just like that painting. It's got all the stuff folks are supposed to like about teen movies, but it's an incoherent, idiotic mess full of horribly, uninteresting and cliched characters. Go watch Risky Business, even it's for the tenth time."
3,Uneven teen romance,"The Girl Next Door, which reminds me of Pretty Woman at times, is a rather uneven romance story about two a teenager and a slightly older former porn actress. It's pretty predictable as are all Hollywood productions these days. Much of the time the movie is kind of cute, and you can't help but feel for the hero Matthew. But both the storyline and the acting are inconsistent, and in the end the movie feels rather old and flaccid (no pun intended).I'm not sure how this unrated version compared to the theatrical-release R version, since I didn't see the film in a movie house. But if you had high hopes for for steamy nude scenes of Elisha, you'll be sorely disappointed. To me this is just a regular R movie."
3,Nothing to write home about,Mildly entertaining but entirely forgettable unless you are a teenage boy.
2,The politically correct girl next door.,"This movie never gets off the ground, due to ""political correctness"", i did see it's potential wasted in almost every scene.every scene had the chance to become outragesly funny but never takes off. theres almost no nudity, none by the female lead at all, all punchline and no joke with this movie. typical politically correct movie for these days."
4,Better Than Average Teenage Sex Film,"Although the plot for this movie is formulaic, this movie does what few movies do in this genre: Leaves the viewer feeling good about the main characters. Even Kelly, played by Timothy Olyphant as the sleazy porn film producer, is not a bad guy. Oh, and while on the subject, Kelly was the most interesting character in the movie. Not to say that the other characters were boring but Kelly stole the movie. James Remar also did an admirable job as Hugo Posh. All in all a solid movie."
4,Every dorks dream,"Ok so mabey this isnt the most realistic movie ever. But thatdoes not stop it from being really funny. The casting is really good as Emile Hirsch is a likeable guy and really easy to identify with. Elisha Cuthbert is scorchingly hot! Should I say that again?Elisha Cuthbert is like, hotter than the sun! She portrays the badgirl with a vulnurable side really well. So if you want to laugh, check this out."
4,Better Than Average Homage To Eighties Teen Sex Flicks,"At it's best ""The Girl Next Door"" reminded me of the best teen sex comedies from the Eighties. One that comes to mind is the relatively obscure ""My Tutor"". At it's weakest it's derivative, if not a downright plagiarism, of ""Risky Business"". The flick's high water mark is the romance between Matthew(Emile Hirsch) and Danielle (Elisha Cuthbert). There's real kineticism between the two of them and the love scenes between the two set off real sparks. However, there are long stretches when Cuthbert isn't in the picture. It's there that the film gets sidetracked by a subplot involving a sleazy pornographer, Kelly(Timothy Olyphant). To his credit Olyphant is charming and smarmy but it is not he but the script that drag the film down. Regardless, there's enough wit and intelligence in the film that I give it the pass."
4,"Cute, Slick, Funny... What more do you want!?","OK, this movie is self-indulgent, immature, unrealistic... But a movie doesn't have to be inspiring and realistic to be good. When you view a movie like this you're hardly expecting to see a heavy classic, but that's because this movie didn't set out to do that! IT'S LIGHT ENTERTAINMENT, GET OVER IT! Escapism, pure fantasy... sure this sort of thing would not happen in real life but does that matter? No! This isn't a classic but it fulfills everything it set out to do. It is entertaining, the acting is great from the main three, the script is amusing, the music is well chosen, it looks nice...for want of a better word. It is a highly enjoyable movie, give it a chance! Plus Elisha Cuthbert is so amazing looking it is untrue..."
2,Less than fluff. Why bother?,"I ended up hating myself for sitting through this entire movie instead of turning it off. My expectations were not THAT high, for sure, but it was total mess. Offers a handful of PG-13 soft-core scenes (yes, even on the unrated dvd) designed to titillate teenage boys, but the other 90% of the movie fails to tie them together. Who ever thought characters could be SO unlikable and undeveloped? Seth Bullock's performance as the caricature [person] is easily the best thing about it. That, and seeing Elisha Cuthbert in a role she's more believable in than the counter-terror intelligence analyst on Fox's ""24"". Another great example of Hollywood insulting the audience with underwritten crap."
3,Its a good movie BUT...,"Unless your a girl you probably wont enjoy this. This is a chick flick kind of thing but if your renting/buying it for the nudity (...). I rented this (its not worth buying) and it was kinda entertaining for a while. Since i just turned 14 and i have better things to do in my young life than watch chick flicks, im going to TP a few houses. =) 3 out of 5 stars."
5,The Girl Next Door,"What a great movie. Someone commented that you would be a different person after watching it. I wouldn't go that far, but I will say I have watched this movie quite a few times, and don't get bored with seeing it again and again. Elisha is extremely hot and beautiful in this movie. I doubt any other actress could fill her shoes and play the part of Danielle. The soundtrack is very thoughtfully put together also. I recommend buying this movie. You will want to watch it again and again."
5,Great Movie That's Mixed with Comedy and Drama,"I love this movie. I thought this would be a lame movie since it hardly made a dent at the box office, but it turned out to be an AWESOME movie. The acting and writing is amazing. I really like the screen chemistry between the characters Matthew and Danielle---they were very believable. This movie really tugs at the heart of what it feels like being in High School and wanting to fit in and do fun things.The music was also great in this movie. If you're deciding to get this movie but not sure, I say get it--it's a brilliant movie."
4,"2004 ""remake"" of Risky Business","OK..OK.... let's face the factsThis movie is a thinly veiled ""remake"" of Risky Business for a new generation.The hooker in Risky Business is a Porn star here... the problem of the house being robbed and the car destroyed is replaced by $25,000 of school funds stolen here.... the dangerous pimp is replaced by a sleazy Porn movie producer.... the ""plan"" to get the money back is to film a porm movie as opposed to running a call-girl operation........ but obviously this movie is basically the Risky Business screenplay with a minor reworking.However, taken for what it is.... 90 minutes of harmless and mindless entertainment.... it is pretty good.It was much better than the other ""serious"" film we rented the same weekend..... GODSEND. Ugghhh now that was flat, lame and bad. A weak comparison to the OMEN series.That girl from the ""24"" Fox series is certainly growing up !"
4,A surprisingly good film.,"Whoever reviewed this for amazon.com obviously didn't look too hard when researching his first couple lines. This did NOT in fact receive a ""nearly unanimous"" beating from critics. It was mixed, and according to rottentomatoes.com, it had more positive reviews than negative (with a 58% rotten rating, just 2% shy of being fresh).As for the movie itself, I love it. I was surprised to love it because I've never been a huge fan of comedies, but I thought it was sweet and funny. There were moments that were just amazing in the movie.Elisha Cuthbert is perfect and Hirsch does a great job as well. I also want to reiterate this isn't normally my type of movie (my 3 favorite movies are Usual Suspects/Shawshank/Almost Famous), so the fact that I love it so much is quite surprising even to me.I'd give it 4.5/5 but since it has to be 4 or 5, i'll say 4, mainly because the cover of the unrated dvd (and the rated dvd) look absolutely terrible (change the cover before it comes out!!)."
3,Not what I ordered,"I ordered the Unrated version of the movie with the bonus digital copy. I received the order on time with a few other movies. Watched the movie and it was alright. Got to looking for the special features and realized they weren't there. Come to find out I had gotten a sealed, plastic wrapped double-sided (one for full screen, one for wide) copy of the RATED movie plus a digital copy of the unrated version in a box that said ""Unrated"". I was rather upset. I really only wanted to see the gag reel. Now I have to go through the hassle of returning it for the proper thing. Amazon's been pretty good about the return process thus far.Movie itself was pretty good. Nice mix of raunchy humor, high school mentality and boyish charm. I'd seen it before but wanted the disk for my Tim Olyphant collection."
1,Pretty lame Movie about Nerd getting babe,"Porn star is the girl next door, as it turns out. This movie sells for the same reason that the girls who tease get what they want. While there is some humor to this story, that's about all that I can say that is good about this film."
2,Pretty lame,"This is a pretty lame rip-off of Risky Business. Despite how hot star Elisha Cuthbert is, she can't save the movie from its horrible script. It starts off promising with good character interaction and some funny situations, but after about half-hour, the events start getting more and more riduculous. By the film's end, the situations are so unbelievable that the film is really laughable.Watch it if you run to it on TV or let a friend rent it. But I wouldn't go out and buy this one. Despite a few laughs and Elisha Cuthbert's presence, there isn't much here."
5,Awesome movie,"This movie has a good story to it. It is a romanic comedy that I think anyone would enjoy. I was surprise that the UMD version has special features with deleted scenes, that was a major plus."
5,Classic Teen Comedy That Everyone Can Enjoy,"I have seen this movie twice already, once at a rather unadvertised sneak preview and again at an advertised sneak preview. It is terrific! The best teen comdey to come along since American Pie. It isn't a gross-out comedy like a Farrelly Bros. movie or even the American Pie movies. It has a surprisingly believable storyline, just get past the central concept of an ex-pornstar living next door and you can imagine these two falling for each other. The movie has a lot of heart, and is funny in all the right places, with no cheap jokes. It doesn't play down to the audience and in fact has a very smart twist ending. The best movie to come this year so far, other than Eternal Sunshine, which is a vastly different type of movie."
2,Pretty good movie; (...),"There's nothing in the ""unrated"" version to justify the salacious marketing on its cover. The movie itself is far less substantial than it should be, as well."
1,DISSAPOINTMENT,"After being informed that N of Tha World was coming out I was excited. I couldn't WAIT for release day. Well, it's here, and I am EXTREMELY dissapointed. This is coming from a very long time NATAS fan. This album is not like WWW.COM, Doubelievengod, or any of their classics; Which should be a good thing, because all NATAS CDs are different and great in their own way. But this CD only has ONE track with Mastamind. Yes, you read correctly, ONE!!!! He raps a decently sub-par third verse on the title track. This is basically a TNT and Esham album. And also, what the HELL was Esham thinking when he did a Metallica ""Enter Sandman"" ripoff track featuring SYN in the chorus?!?!?!? The drum loop sounds exactly like the drums in Run DMC's cover of ""Walk This Way"". This is disgusting. I am very dissapointed. Save the 20 bucks and keep bumpin' your school NATAS CDs, because I'm afraid NATAS is now completely washed-up."
3,Filler Material?,"I usually like Thackeray's works a lot. That's why I didn't hesitate to buy this. Book of Snobs seemed to be something he wrote to break in a new pen; or maybe he had promised a publisher something on a deadline and ran out of ideas. Parts are humorous, but I was bored. Thank goodness I read quickly; otherwise I'm not sure I would have finished it. Do not let this review of a single book turn you off to Thackeray. Do try Henry Esmond or Barry Lyndon. (The third star is because it's Thackeray - and maybe I missed something.)"
4,Mozart at its best,I have enjoyed this marvelous production with some of the best voices available 20 years ego . The production was great.It helped us to undestand the whole plot before going to the Met in NYC in December and see their life performance. I highly recommend it.
4,general ahiman rezon and freemasons guide,"the book and information was great, just the print of the books pages , the lettering was quite small.."
5,Erik Rutan rules!,"Absolutely one of the best debut albums I have heard for any band. Every song is filled with pure intensity and brutality. I knew erik was talented when i heard what he did with morbid angel on their excellent album, Domination. But this CD just lets his true energy and aawesome guitar playing shine! Definitely recommended for any true metal fan."
1,morbid angel is better...,I dont like technical deathmetal thats the reason i dont like kataklysm either and hate eternal is just as horrible and morbid angel is way better then hate eternal! Both of hate eternal's album suck so dont buy it! skip it & support morbid angel insted! Laters! All the songs suck... Laters!
2,characterless,"i am a death metal fan (cryptopsy, pessimist, gorguts). i love the technical stuff and can appreciate a good grind. this album however, is not up to par. the songs themselves are all the same tempo, the riffs are all very similar with the same construction; there are no tempo changes (but one motion change i think), no expression, no sort of dynamic, no direction changing, nothing. the solos are surprisingly weak and expressionless as well; is this the same guy who trades solos with azagthoth of morbid angel? can't he do better than this? the solos don't even pretend to change the song or augment a section, theyre just there. very poor musical awareness overall. the entire album is static (the same throughout). its like the same piece over and over, and its not a very good one. on the up side, the drummer is excellent and everything is executed well. but it is the medium that is at fault here. i imagine the next one will be better."
4,Great death metal,"I had first heard ""King of All Kings"". The only complaint I had was that the drums sounded paper thin. I recently heard ""I, Monarch"" and was impressed, so I had to hear where it all started. I am a HUGE fan of great drumming, and Tim Yeung DEFINITELY hit the spot. He reminds me of Tony Laureno and Dave Culross.The only complaint I have is, yes, the songs run together. They are a bit samey, but I listen to Deeds of Flesh and it's hard to decipher their songs, so, I am used to it.I am not going to bash the 'ole Slipknot fan but I will say this much...I am tired of death metal being called talentless. I had a teacher at school rip into about 18 different bands because ""he plays guitar and listens to Dave Matthews and knows that they use 3 power chords"" it irritates me just because he hates the growling.Get this album, you won't be disappointed."
3,lack of ventilation via cap,The two pieces are air tight. This leads to difficulty when trying to enclose the cigar. The bottom piece developed a crack sometime during the early use. I can still use it to protect my cigar in my golf bag.
5,Simple Tube,"Made from hard plastic, cannot be crushed, it is telescoping tube meaning it pops up and down for your 6inches and up cigars"
5,An insightful fable that is both touching and entertaining,This is a quick enjoyable read that is at once insightful and entertaining. It has shades of Shel Silverstein crossed with Richard Bach.
5,A quirky memoir,"When I read this book, I laughed; I smirked; and I had to share the experience with others. I shared the book with selected friends, relatives and co-workers who enjoyed this quirky discovery. This delightful book about an angst-ridden clam is not for everyone. The reader must be intelligent and possess a quirky sense of humor. Pseudo-intellectuals will scoff at it. Humor-challenged individuals will find it meaningless. The angry clam is a little book with a big vocabulary that presents a simple story. The book is not about the plotline, however. It simply laughs at pop psychiatry, thumbs its nose at philosophical pretensions, mocks pseudo-intellectual vanity, and generally has fun with the English language."
3,This book isn't really for beginners.,"Although this book was somewhat helpful, it seemed to be a mere summary of knowledge, and not exactly in the proper order; if you were to follow this book from front to back, you would get lost pretty quick. Hart doesn't go into detail, nor does he explain anything. He just assumes you ""get it,"" so if you truely are a beginner, this book won't help you much as far as drawing cartoon characters."
5,HART'S BOOKS ARE THE BEST,"I have this book and many others of Christopher Hart, i really like this 1 as i am a begginer and find that working thru this book and others is very helpful, Hart's style is second to none i always look for books on cartooning and have stopped buying others and only collect his. Others i like are, Drawing the funny side of the brain, Everything you wanted to know about cartooning, How to draw cartoons for comic strips, how to draw cartoon animals, these are all great. Keep em coming Hart.....Thanks"
4,"Good, but ""Everything You Ever Wanted To Know About Cartooning"" is better.","""Cartooning For The Beginner"", is a great resource for beginners like me (no art or drawing experience at all). It would have received a 5 star if I had not purchased the ""Everything You Ever Wanted To Know About Cartooning"" book as well.The instruction is good, the tips are relevent, but in comparison to E.Y.E.W.T.K.A.C.B.W.A.T.D it doesn't have the same ""Snap"" to it. I recommend getting both books but if you have to choose get the Best Seller.I have to say I will purchase more of this author's books. Thanks"
3,good book,Genereally it's a good book. somehow my son is not as interested comparing tothe other books he borrowed from library.maybe it's too beginning
5,Messer transforms sadness & loss into moving poetry,"Sometimes the most moving stories are crafted out of sadness and loss. Violence brings emptiness, then despair, then slowly redemptive gain. Only a brave person would share this loss with others. Only a gifted poet could transform it into something beautiful and eternal.Richard Messer's poetry has the ability to see the transcendent in the ordinary, and to bring the sacred into our daily lives. This unified collection of poems will touch the reader and make them want to find more of his extraordinary work."
1,Definitely an Amazon Oddity,"Consider buying this as a trinket, not as a functional piece of equipment. The citric acids in lemon juice will erode the gold-plating before your eyes."
5,Beautifully written piece,"Michael Cunningham's love for Provincetown soars in the beautiful prose of Land's End (A Walk in Provincetown). This short volume is the equivalent of a prose poem in tribute to an unique town. It has only two streets but what an amazing amount of humanity is crammed in there during the summer to be followed by the desolate quiet of winter. This book is perfect to curl up with on this snowy, cold New York day while one dreams back to one's own times in Provincetown in those warmer summer days of past and future. This town is perfect for a volume this size and, much like a weekend spent in Provincetown, I was sad to see it end but knew that I had not missed a thing in a such a small, yet perfect, town. Some may bemoan both the inclusiveness of this book (and Provincetown itself) but then this is not the town for them. A well-written, charming, highly recommended book."
5,I LOVE ROSIE GAINES SONG!!!!,"HIDDDEN HITS VOL.1 IS THE TIGHTEST CD I EVER HEARD. ALL THE ARTISTS ON THERE DESERVES A RECORD CONTRACT. I SPECIALLY LOVE THAT SONG, ""I CAN'T GET U OFF MY MIND"" BY ROSIE GAINES. THAT SONG WILL BE A POPULAR STEPPING SONG IN STEPPING SETS OF CHICAGO.HIDDEN BEACH RECORDINGS IS THE NEW ERA OF R&B AND NEO-SOUL MUSIC.KEEP UP THE GOOD WORK AND PUT ROSIE GAINES ON THE MAP AS SOON AS YOU CAN!!!!"
5,NEO-SOUL AT IT S BEST !!!,"Hidden Beach has done it again!!! This is one of best undiscovered neo-soul albums out there. It's the kind of album you put and everyone says: ""Who is that?"" Several undiscovered artists are ont his album.Every song and artist like Mike Phillips will keep you in that neo-soul music. If you're a lover of neo-soul, this album is a must have."
2,semi sucked,"gone fishin is the only good cut on the entire cd, there are some others that are ""un-skip-able"" but otherwise its a mindless background compilation of off brand bama no names. consistant fake neo-soul electric beat throughout the cd can be annoying if you have been there before. i would have been mad if i paid more than $10 for it. it serves its purpose as a stuck in traffic soundtrack, however, i find myself listening to ""gone fishin"" over and over again."
2,BOOTY!!!!!! not good @ all!!!,"This is not a good cd. this is 3rd rate talent fo real! HB does good stuff but this one really bites!! there are a few good acts, but the hip hop one here is really not good. like they are a bunch of Common and Mos Def rip offs!!!!!This cd is the let down of the summer"
4,"What , What? Hidden Beach is doin' it!","Everyone once in awhile a compilation that comes along that blows you away. It's better than any recent Soundtrack album I can think of. Consistent in quality, it's so good! It's in heavy rotation in my changer. Faves are Myron, Trek Life, Aquila, Quinn and of course Mike Philly! Hidden Beach has such cool music!"
3,Good deal for the price,"Overall a good setup. Toner lasts a long time, easy to use, etc. The only frustration I've had is the fax-to-pc part... cannot get it working - and I'm a computer person by trade."
4,Good Machine for the money,"Works great, we did have a problem, the local printer repair shop accepted the warranty, and repaired it for free. Very happy so far (coming up on the 1 year mark when the warranty runs out...)"
5,"As long as you're writing them, I'm buying them!","Keep them coming, Jack!The characters and settings of these stories are pure pleasure. The dialogue is a complete joy. And, any dachshund owner can tell you how true they are to the endlessly fascinating parculiarities of the breed.I am hoping this series contiunues for a loooong time (sorry--couldn't resist)--if so, I have finally found my cache of feel-good fiction!"
3,"Another Redstripe, Please","Not too bad of a book, a little different than most dachshund stories I have read. Would have been nice to have some illustrations in it though."
5,Cri Cri por el mundo,"The songs on Cri Cri por el mundo, like all the music that is the legacy of Francisco Gabilondo Soler, is still a total delight for children and adults alike (but they're at their best when you understand Spanish)."
5,Remembering Nguyen,"I found Remembering Nguyen to be captivating and intriguing yet simple and direct. I couldn't put it down. Brawley relates his story as it was, no hindsight BS, no moral rationalization.This well written memoir has liberal doses of humor. Like a voyeur you have insight into Mamasan's numba one boom boom girls. It is a fast paced emotionally compelling view of a young soldier in Vietnam. I am looking forward to reading Brawley's seguel, "" Welcome home, Son."""
5,Remembering Nguyen,"The author creates an anticaption which allows the reader to look forward to each chapter. He also enables the reader to experience the ""Vietnam Phenomenon"" personally.Type size and spacing allows for easy readng and a great book for quick, late night reading. Humorous and witty."
5,TOP NOTCH BLUES GUITARIST,"This young man will be around for a long time & will deliver many more great works,This is just one disc in a short span of time that began in 2002 when at age eleven his first rockin blues cd was released ""A Few Degrees Warmer"" Blew Everyone socks off.All the songs on this disc are Jamm Packed [as you can hear by the sound bytes]with great gobs of tasty Electric Guitar Blues..check him out at [...]"
1,Over the hill,1987. That says it all. The world has changed since William Cohen wrote this how-to book. He warns us to have only one typist type up the plan. (Typist?) He doesn't discuss changes in the marketplace. Outsourcing is rare. There's little about developing the right mix of product and service. There's nothing on educating the customer. Or maintaining the customer relationship over time. I can't really imagine anyone but really lazy professors keeping this turkey alive.
3,Funny plaque but smaller than expected,I thought this was going to be much larger. This is about the size of your hand. I paid about $20 dollars with shipping included and I wouldn't do it again unless this was much less expensive especially since so many things ship for free with Prime on Amazon and this does not.
4,plaque,The plaque was a bit smaller than i expected but the saying is nice. I didn't see the size on the plaque
4,Yummy,"I have never had olives (other than what you get in the can) but these are very tasty. One of the varieties is a little bitter for my tastes. Olives are NOT pitted. Shipping costs seem high.I think i am addicted to the things, i am ordering my 3rd bag."
3,Needs additional spices,"The bag isn't as large as I'd had hoped, no scratch that, the bag was as large, but not as full. Straight out the bag, way too tangy for my taste. Didn't matter to me though if they were tangy since my plan was to spice em anyway. It came out to 8 almost full pint jars with the oil and spices. With the added olive oil and varying amounts of citrus, peppers, roasted bell peppers, garlic and spice they were transformed into a five star product. But without the spice, they were just okay.They have a nice texture, my BF likes the large, meaty green ones that have to be scraped off the pit with your teeth, I like all of them! The purple are slightly smushy and makes for a nice textural contrast. If you're an olive-lover and take time to make them something special, it's a good purchase."
1,Why not to buy the country olive mix,"I have been buying olives from Amazon for years and these are the worst I have received. The mix was supposed to have cracked olives, for some reason I was thinking cracked green olives with coriander, like they have in Cyprus. What arrived were just green olives, raw, green, uncured, green olives. Also, about five pounds and no liquid, after I poured the olives into a large jar, there was about one inch of liquid. the rest of the olives were not all that good. Not good"
3,"When they're good, they're great, but they're not always good.","I've ordered these olives on 5 different occasions. They'd become a favorite snack.However, two of these 5 times, they arrived in a rather poor state: the olives were perhaps cured too long or stored too long or something, as they were quite mushy - even the normally firm, green ones.There are apparently no returns on these, so sadly I'm having to rethink whether I want to continue ordering them.When they arrive in a good state, they're excellent, and the price beats any other olives of remotely similar quality I've seen in stores or elsewhere on the web. But when they arrive mushy, it's kind of hard to eat them - the normally firm ones have the consistency of an overripe pear, and the normally-firm and normally-soft ones taste a little more acidic than I think they probably should."
5,Better than any jar,These are excellent quality firm olives; similar to what we get in Greece and Italy. I'll definitely buy them again.
3,to big for my dog,have to cut in half he is a pekingese good for a larger breed dog.we need a little pill
5,The Legendary Joe Bussard,Bussard is a legend among old record collectors and this opening of his vaults promises musical bliss. For the complete story on Bussard go to http://www.bluesworld.com/Bussard.html -- and after reading it you'll have to agree with the previous reviwer that one CD is not enough. Maybe there will be future volumes....
4,FOUR STARS- BUT NOT FIVE,"THERE IS NO NEED TO GO INTO WHO JOE BUSSARD IS, HE IS A LEGEND AMONG RECORD COLLECTORS. HE HAS THE LARGEST PRIVATELY OWNED COLLECTION OF 78'S IN THE WORLD. THIS CD IS A SNIPPET OF WHAT HE HAS IN HIS BASEMENT. I LIKE THE CD BUT I THINK THERE IS TOO MUCH ""HILLBILLY"" MUSIC. NOT SURPRISING SINCE THAT KIND OF MUSIC IS REALLY JOE'S PASSION. I AM MORE INCLINED TO LISTEN TO HOT JAZZ, RAGTIME, HAWAIIAN, AND BLUES, BUT THAT'S JUST MY PERSONAL PREFERENCE. ADDENDUM TO ORIGINAL REVIEW: FOR THOSE OF YOU WHO DIDN'T LIKE MY REVIEW OF THIS RELEASE, I WOULD DIRECT YOUR ATTENTION TO ANOTHER CD FROM OLD HAT, CALLED ""GOOD FOR WHAT AILS YOU"" (MUSIC OF THE MEDICINE SHOWS 1926-1937). THIS CD IS INFINITELY MUCH BETTER, AND A LOT LESS ""HILLBILLY"". DON'T TAKE MY WORD FOR IT, PLAY EACH ONE OF THEM AND YOU TELL ME WHICH ONE YOU THINK IS BETTER."
5,Louis Armstrong Young Music Maker,"This book has a five star rating because it gives great detail into the life of Louis Armstrong. It tells of all the struggles he encounter as a child, as a teen, and the challenges he met as an adult as well. This book would be a great book for any your person who was interested in the live of Louis Armstrong and the struggles he encountered throught his life. This book gives insight into his life as a person and as a musician."
1,"Not very durable, wont last long","Looked good when it arrived, it's great if you don't plan to sit on it. Did'nt last long after using, had loose beads rolling around before long. The stitching that hold the beads is some cheap breakable plastic and my body weight(225lbs) was enough to break the stitching in a short period of time."
2,not all that great!,"Personally, I found that this book wasnt all that great. I was expecting much more from it. It did have nice photographs and gave you a good (but very brief) history of the vineyards as well as the other brands that the same vineyards has. Each champagne is talked about in 2-3 paragraphs. I was hoping that it would have had more info on the prices of each bottle and some info on what best would accompany each champagne if you were to serve it for guests. All in all, I was somewhat disappointed with my purchase."
2,The handles broke before I even got my stuff put into it!,"I do take very good care of my personal possesions, so for the handle to break on this after two days of going back and forth to my office I was very dissatisfied. It is cheaply made. Not worth buying."
5,Excellent,I'm very happy with the product. Plenty of space to add additional paper or inserts. Looks more expensive than it cost.
2,Exactly what I ordered...but the zipper was defective,"I received my binder in two days. It was packed very well and was just what I expected. I think the quality is good. I used to use the Daytimer brand many years ago, it was the standard for the company I worked for.If you are looking for a well made full size binder with room for everything this is a good choice. It isn't slim but you can minimize the bulk by rotating 3 months of your planner at a time. I use the two day planner sets. You can also add full letter size documents if you use a standard hole puncher. It also has a nice expanding pouch for letter size documents inside the front cover.Well worth the price from what I've seen in the stores. I have a smaller franklin planner and this compares nicely.Update: After using the binder for a few days the zipper completely locked up. I'm returning it."
2,"Bulky, might as well get a real bag",This attache organizer is so big you might as well get an actual shoulder bag to put everything in. It's unnecessarily padded which adds to the bulk.
3,"decent, but flawed.","These are decent boots, and they have the advantage of being slightly higher than one would expect, coming to just a few inches below my knees.On thing I've found is that since they are black, if you use them in direct sunlight, they will become very uncomfortably hot. They are also fairly thin.Another thing missing is a a ridge on the back of the boot to make taking them off easier. Previous boots of this type had that, which let me take off the boot with the other foot quite easily.On the other hand, these boots are quite cheap, so FOR THE MONEY it's still not a bad deal."
2,Wrong color,The cue and case is great but the only thing is I ordered purple. The picture shows purple lining inside the case (my wifes most liked color). But it's blue. She was not happy but she said she would keep it. So I don't know if she will lit me order anything else from Amazon.
2,pool stick,very poor quality when i got it it was all scratched up had dings on it and broke the first week of using it will never buy another
1,Fun game (has potential) but numerous BUGS,"This game is fun with the exception of some major bugs. There seems to be major graphic and mouse problems. My system easily met all the requirements but I had nothing but problems from the initial install. I even tried the latest patch 1.01 and things got worse. The games locks up right at the main menu screen with the patch installed. It's too bad, the game was right fun even though I had to suffer through the graphic and mouse problems before the patch. P.S. - I don't have any problems running Age of Empies II, Sudden Strike, Shogun and Command and Conquer Red Alert 2. Buyer beware..."
2,At least I got it to run...,"It runs. Thats the good part. The game is a low-grade Age of Empires. Don't bother, just don't bother."
1,ZzzzZzzz.....,"WHAT...THE...HECK...IS...THIS? Never in my life have I seen a game so cheap, so poor, or so dispicable! This game is about America and stages from the Native Americans, to the Civil War, to WWII soldiers. You might consider this game if your a major history buff, but all that it is a cheap clone of Age of Empire. ...."
1,Please... Stop the pain.,"America is another example of why Data Becker should change their strategy from making video games, to not making video games."
3,"""Only Indians can swim""...?!?!?!?","Haven't played it, haven't seen it active on a computer. I read the back of the box in a store, and I have to wonder -- what brainiac game designer decided that ONLY INDIANS CAN SWIM? I suppose it must serve some strategic purpose within the game to have different skills and different limitations for each group, Mexicans versus Natives versus cavalry. But with such obviously unrealistic limitations as ONLY INDIANS CAN SWIM, I have to wonder how backwards the rest of the game must be."
5,A great buy!,"I'm satisfied in every way! I had planned on buying a Gitzo until a friend recommended this one. Unless you need status, the Velbon 640 is half price, looks great, weighs very little and is solid as a rock with my Nikon D70. Just what I need for my excursions into the backcountry. Highly recommended."
3,Frozen Impact,OK - not great. It is not one that I will watch over and over - which is how I rate them. The story line is too over the top but it does have some great action scenes.
4,Not a guide book,"If you haven't been to Prague, don't buy this book as your guide book. You will be disappointed. But I don't think the purpose of the book is to introduce the city to tourists. But if you've visited the city before and explored, it really brings back memories. It actually made me want to go back and revisit the places the author wrote about. Her writing style isn't exactly my favorite, but it was a good read. If there was a 1 to 10 stars scale, I would give this book 7 stars."
3,Tales of the city that are little off the beaten path ...,"A fun, brief and slightly unconventional exploration of contemporary Prague. This author introduces the city and creates little vignettes that portray the quirky cultural energy that makes it a unique and distinguished city. I'd love to have read more of the history of the city. But there's enough here to make it an enjoyable read. The author's style is light and highly accessible."
3,Too sensitive!,I will likely go out and buy a unit that has an adjustable sensitivity dial. This unit will indicate when a wire is hot from over a foot away! Wires I'm working on could be off but pick up a live wire from another circuit and cause extra work tracking down the truth.
3,Not impressed,"Good product with quality materials but you have to hold down the clip while using it, not very convenient but OK for occational use."
2,Farberware toaster,"Very lightweight and the crumb drawer a plus for easy removal. Makes great toast, especially easy to accommodate thicker homemade bread slices. The unit design is poor in that the lever collided with the circuit card and was inoperable out of the box. Fortunately my husband being a mechanical engineer was able to completely disassemble the toaster and correct the problem but this isn't everyone's option. Maybe mine was a lemon since Farberware customer service claims they never heard of this problem previously."
4,All's well up to this point,I've only used occasionally for a six-week period. I'm still learning the dark/light selections for different breads. I tried the defrost because we keep extra bread in the toaster and found out that the Defrost selection doesn't just defrost but toasts as well. I have no issue with any of the controls or configurations and would recommend this toaster to anyone.
3,Great book from a man with quite alot of experancs,"DIFFERENTOF GAMESI LIKED THE BOOK VERY MUCH,IT COVERED ALOT OF DIFFERENT GAMES AND LOTS OF THE EVERY DAY PEOPLE WHO PLAYED OR NOT.HAN SOME GREAT INTERVIEWS FROM PLAYERS AND NON PLAYERS TOLD HOW TO AVOID PITFALLS."
3,A Little Flat,"I've listened to a few of these live Pearl Jam performances and I have to say that I think this one is quite flat. The songs are sung and the benefit comes from being there but that's not going to happen on a CD. There are about two or three places in this performance where Vedder does speak Japanese to the audience which is cool but certainly not worth the price of the CD. If you're a fan this might help to round out your collection, if you'r enew to the live Pearl Jam CDs there are better recordings to pick up first."
4,"5 star setlist, 3 star performance (for Pearl Jam)","This is a great show, easily the best and longest setlist of the Pacific Rim tour, and the three stars is based solely from other performance by them; this is a 5 star performance by nearly any other band. As the previous review stated, Release is great. However, this show pales in comparison to Osaka the next night, even with a superior setlist. I have 15 bootlegs from the fanclub on this tour, Tokyo and Osaka being two of them. I think that casual fans can enjoy this show, but Pearl Jam fans who don't already have a bunch of the bootlegs may want to wait for the behemoth that is State College...34 songs, tons of improvs, over 3 hours...I would NOT recommend that one to the casual fan, simply too much to digest.So in short, the casual fan will do fine by this show, the non-fanatical Pearl Jam fan should wait. The fanatical Pearl Jam fan already has it :)"
3,Mozart - Idonmeneo,The opera was great. This production is awesome. Pavarotti was wonderful. ...but I gave the over all dvd 3 stars because of a flaw in the last aria by Pavarotti. It stalled and skipped. I was so disappointed because it is my favorite aria in this entire opera and I could not hear it. This was a remastered new dvd. I played it on other devices and got the same disappointing results. I did complain and was compensated minimally. I was told that a replacement dvd would not guarantee a lack of the same flaw!! So disappointing!
5,Fishing lure collector!,"My husband collects old, antique fishing lurers and is a member of the NFLCC collector club. He enjoys any book that helps him identify lures."
2,Disappointed!,"We have a previous edition and wanted to update. This edition does not have anything but lures, no reels!"
2,Not The Best B2K CD...,"I didn't really like this CD.Reason One: The remixes aren't that good.Reason Two: Rerun songs.Aren't some of these songs on the B2K, Pandemonium! album? If you have Pandemonium!(Special Edition), then I suggest not buying this CD. It's not their best work. This CD doesn't get you on your feet, or make you bob your head like their other CD's.If you like B2K, then you'll probably like B5! Chech B5 out!Leah Star Age:16"
1,Crappy remix CD,"B2K: The Remixes,Vol 2 is a waste of the fellas talent and the only noteable track is the R.Kelly remix of Girlfriend."
2,Not as good as Saving Grandma,"Despite reading this book in record time, I felt somewhat disappointed. I really enjoyed 'Portofino' and 'Saving Grandma', but this book did not work for me. It is set in the period between the two earlier books, but appears to cover much of the same material as 'Saving Grandma', which I'm sure would make no sense after reading this. There are no significant new characters and Calvin's adventures are covered rather superficially. There seemed to be a lot more religious content to this book than the previous two, which I found rather distracting and did not enhance my enjoyment. The style is the same as the other two books, and if you liked those you will probably enjoy this, but just don't expect too much."
3,"Funny, scathing attack","Funny, fictional narrative that bears a close resemblance to Schaeffer's real-life family (Protestant missionaries) in Switzerland. Those who grew up in fundamentalist families will recognize many of the stumbles and foibles they endured in their formative years."
3,Coming Of Age Breaking Bad,"Zermatt was like Portofino gone emo. Chronologically this story takes place when Calvin is 14, so it is the second book. However, it seems to be shoe-horned in between the first two books. I did read this book last.I can't imagine this dysfunctional family recovering enough to be the same family in Saving Grandma. Schaeffer demonstrates absurdity by being absurd. However, in Zermatt the tone goes dark, sad and pathological. The main thing it has in common with other two books are just the characters. This is an adult book with dark themes that should stand by itself. I'm sure some of excesses and pathology does exist in Christianity but when the author uses a family we kind of like and abruptly turns them into crazies, it reeks of the cheap-shot. ""If it bends it's funny, If it breaks it isn't"" and this story breaks. Standing alone it would be a good novel on the level of Death Of A Salesman or Streetcar Named Desire. I give it 3 stars."
2,Too basic,"This book is almost too basic. It goes into such details like: how to highlight text, move graphics on a page, and how to close the program.It would be fine if that was only done in the first chapter, but it seems to go on and on and on. I would have liked a more ""hands-on"" tutorial where you actually build a web page along with the author, rather than just explaining how all the different functions work."
3,Basic information,"This is a good book for the absolute novice to not only Frontpage but to computing in general. I would recommend this book highly to those starting out with computers. If you want in-depth information about FrontPage, try a different book."
4,"great album, great band","""Movement"" totally rocks my socks off.I bought this CD and was blown away by its simple, relentless energy.Then I saw them the band live a few days later,and I can honestly say that The Gossip is for real.They rock with the same abandon as The Yeah Yeah Yeahs,but Beth Ditto's soulful vocals give The Gossip's brand of rock a slightly different flavor.Do yourself a favor and pick up this CD."
1,a bit messy.,"i thought this albulm was quite bad, which isnt to say that i didnt enjoy the earlier work. these songs arent nearly as exciting and dynamic. they are actually a bit boring and at times, the lyrics are terribly grating and make me feel embarrased. specifically, i am thinking of the song where the singer assures us that she isnt willing to sell herself for coolness through the application of material indie signifiers..yet, the albulm art design and the general image represented here point that argument in a different direction."
1,Unnecessary,"Sure, you can buy this software, but the question is, ""Why would you want to?"" There has not yet been a single Mac OS X virus in the wild. If you're a security nut who's concerned about a possible future virus, go buy it, but buyer beware. The only reason you would need antivirus software for your Mac would be if you were running Virtual PC for Windows, but even then, you would want a Windows version, and there is no possibility that viruses could transfer from the Virtual PC to your Mac because the Mac cannot understand the language these viruses are programmed in. (Look in _The Missing Manual: Switching to Mac_ for more information.)"
3,wow..fail,this thing sucks it wayyy tooo big to be work without packing it with mask foam and its soft and ALL the hair falls out. but cheap enough. cant imagine paying more then 25$ for it at most
3,description,This is an investigation into the roots of Islamic fundamentalist terror in the Middle East. It explores the motives behind the worst terrorist attack in history and probes the failure to fully understand the hatred that motivates Osama bin Laden...
2,The beginning of their end.,"This was their first poppish album, when their lyrics and beats became geared more toward females and club going metrosexuals.Only a couple of good tracks, if you've heard their earlier material, then you know which songs I'm talking about.MTV queers will dig this, however fans of their earlier Horror-core style will only find themselves pressing the skip button often."
2,Don't buy this for more than $5,"This album is a waste of time and money. Only a couple of tracks were good, but not great like their last albums. I wouldn't spend no more than $5 on this. If you can, just get the tracks you want on the MP3 Player for a dollar a piece."
2,Decent beats...,"Three Six Mafia has always been known for their thumping beats, and Juicy J and DJ Paul certainly provide Da Unbreakables with some sub punishers. However, lyrically, the quartet is weak. To be honest, I don't even know why they added Crunchy Black. ""Ridin Spinners"" and ""Testin My Gangsta"" are good, entertaining songs. ""Rainbow Colors"" is decent also, mostly due to the screw feel and Flip's guest verse. Songs like ""Shake Dat Jelly"" and ""F*ck That Sh*t"" should have been scrapped long before the CD was printed. ""Like A Pimp Remix"" doesn't even come close to representing the UGK classic like it should. A disappointing album with a few keepers."
3,Got Rid of The Talent,"In the older Three six cd's Koopsta Knicca was by far the best mystic style rapper of the group, however he isnt heard once on the album. Three six just disses him, but what they dont realize is without Koopsta they suck, they sound like any other group rapping about how much money they have, and blah, blah. Now im not sayin the cd blows, its a good cd, i just think the moneys to there heads cause they fled the style i loved them for."
1,True Hip Hop Fan,"After hearing all the hype about 36 I figured I would buy one of their CDs. I can't believe people like these guys. They have no talent. Every song is basically the same, just a slightly different beat. I thought D12 ran the whole saying rediculous things to piss people off thing into the ground until I heard these guys. If I could I would give this 0 stars. Save your money for the new Method Man, Dre, Redman, or some other legit artist that has a new album coming out."
3,DJ Paul missing arm?????,One of my fellow triple six listening friends told me something weird. A couple months ago he told me that DJ Paul got shot in the arm and it is now deformed. I did not think much of it until I realized that most of the recent pictures I've seen Paul in he is only showing one arm. Also...included with the new Lil Wyte cd is a DVD with a preview for Choices 2. In the preview if you put the DVD in slow motion when DJ and Juicy are in the jail cell you can see Paul's crazy arm. If anyone has any info post it on a review for this cd.
2,ITS ALL OVER,"I regret to say this is the worst album i have ever heard by three six mafia comin from me that is pretty bad i own over 30 of three six mafia and solo cd's by the group, and this is definitely the worst one what happend to the hardcore sound of mystic stylez or koop's ""da devils playground"" i own this cd only cause i am a fan of what used to be the best damn group in all of the rap industry but it's all gone downhill since chap. 2 and when the smoke clears. damn commercial sell outs ""ridin spinners my ass"""
4,juiceman and paul do it again,"not much 2 say but a great cd i felt dat ridin spinners was sort of ruined by lil flip and it would have been fresh to here some more project pat or lil wyte on tha cd... tha fact dat 3 memberz are now gone takez some freshness out of it if your expectin sik versus by gangsta boo or anybody else look at anutha cd like when tha smoke clearz but trakz like ""wolf wolf"",""beatem 2 da floor"",""lets start a riot"",""mosh pit"" & ""dangerous posse"" make da cd worth whiling. PEACE EASY 4 LEEZY oh and if you wanna here more fresh artists check out anybody from hypnotize minds rec. psychopathic rec. loud rec. or suburban noise rec."
4,t t t triple six,"I will tell you right now, i own 6 of three six's albums(like 9 if u count lil wyte,gangta boo, and hypnotize camp posse...then the three project pat's i also own)and the collection continues to grow. this one of the best since ""When the smoke clears"". Of course eveyone loves ""ridin spinners"" but i like the remix w/ lil wyte and gangsta boo....highlight tracks include: Try Sumpthin, Lets start a riot, Rainbow Colors(if u like chopped and screwed,and Lil Flip), You scared pt2(cause of the beat,and Juvenile) last but not least the best song on the whole album -Dangerous Posse--HCP Memphis 10!"
4,Three Six Mafia Comes Back w/ another Classic,"This album is so dope. Its right up there w/ world domination and when the smoke clears. Every track brings the expected three six mafia flavor and energy. Its a shame that their record label isn't giving them the marketing they deserve because this album could go platinum easy. I'm a huge three six fan and I barely knew the album was coming out. But for those who do buy this cd, ull be pleased fo sho."
2,Da unbreakables,"BE HONEST I AINT FEELIN THIS JOINT 2 MUCH DID HALF EXPECT IT THOUGH!BY FAR THREE 6 WORLD DOMINATION IS THEIR CLASSIC IN MY EYES AND NOW ALOT OF THE TRACCS ARE FILTERED DOWN SINCE THEM TIMES. IM ONLY FEELIN AROUND THREE TRACCS OUTTA 18 ON THIS PROJECT,IMMA STILL HOLD DOWN THEM TRACCS KA I GOTZ X AMOUNT OF TRIPLE 6 ART N DONE KNOW DJ N JUICE CAN PRODUCE BUT OTHER TEAM MEMBERS MAY LET THE SIDE DOWN...UNBREAKABLES???"
2,stink,"After all the anticipation of this album, I thought it was going to be gold. Hearing it the first time around,no songs caught my attention, they all sounded drawn out and terrible. The only promissing song that may grow on me is the posse song."
3,its AIGHT,Yo word up they aint like they used 2 be since they lost they top people but its a AIGHT album 4 jus 4 people but it coulve been better cuz im used 2 da good n ol top stuff
3,"Good, but definitely not the best they have out!","First off, this CD is good, the reason it doesnt get 4 or 5 stars is because its missing Gangsta Boo, Koopsta Knicca, T-Rock, and few other former Prophet/HCP members. The album has a good flow, but the beats, for the most part, are not like the Three 6 Mafia of earlier albums like, The End, Chpt. 2 World Domination or Body Parts. This is definitely worth gettin jus to add to your CD collection of Three 6 Mafia. If your not a fan yet, then don't start with this album, you need to buy The End, then Chpt. 2 World Domination, then When The Smoke Clears. And as far as guest appearances, Lil Flip was ok, but a BoneCrusher or Ludacris would have been alot better. So, all in all, get it if you a hardcore fan, if not, get them earlier CD's first then buy this one, holla!!!"
5,Hardest Album Out Herre,"My boyz done didi it again. Dis is the hardest most gansta album they ever made. The beatz is out of dis world and Da Juice Mane and DJ really put it down on dis herre. I advice yall go get dis right now, matter of fact get 2 of em. Im out"
5,its about time....,"well after hearing the strong performances on da headbussaz and the insane beats on the lil wyte album, this cd had left me in a craze, anticipating the release. and finally it is here.... simply put: this cd from begining to end is a masterpeice. the same hardcore lyrics, and dirty south beats, all top out and followed by peak preformances by all four of the rappers in the group. lil flip, project pat and lil wyte all drop versus and all hold strong. this cd has no skits (except the outro) but you can easliy listen to this over and over clear through every song is strong, and three six shows that they are the best in memphis, as well as a giant from the south juicy j and dj paul truly shine is this cd as the supa producers, and lord infamous shows his best on this cd too, and crunchy blac pulls through with his amazing flow. this is a must get, a platinum cd for sure!"
1,Dissapointing,"Just got my copy of ""Jeff"" this morning. Had a few listens.... first impression.... too samey. Most of the tracks sound too unstructured as if JB has just been cut and pasted into tracks. His guitar tone has been better, most of this sounds like a Line 6 POD (I think some of it is) with some samples and kit thrown in... can't hear much bass. No real stand out tracks.I think YHIC was miles better, also had more musicians on it. I really like electronic music but don't see this as groundbreaking. Too many vocal samples used to try and spice up things.A thing that is starting to show in the compositions is there are not a lot of real arrangements with key changes etc... just grooves in one key.I know some of you guys are going to rip me to shreds for all this but this is my own opinion. I still think JB is an amazing performer live but needs more clear defined ideas/melodies in the studio.Dissapointing"
5,OUTSTANDING!!!,"I've been a Jeff Beck fan for thirty years (wow, I'm getting old), and this is my favorite thing he's ever done. I read his interview in Guitar player back in 2003, and when asked what it was like making his new album, he said ""I hated it more than anything I've ever done"". I was bummed out after reading that, so I didn't buy the CD until 2006. Man what a shock! This is the freshest most exciting thing I've ever heard. I guess he was just tired of working on it because of the tediousness of working with computers. He also made the comment ""this is the last time I ever make a record with a mouse"". Jeff is over 60 but sounds as young and talented as any guitarist on the planet. This CD is a MUST have! Every track absolutely SMOKES!"
2,Could have been a good album,"A few decent JB licks, but the idiotic vocalizations are so distracting as to be an impediment to the whole work. Thinking about editing out the singers. I only wish they'd provide master copies to the customer so you could import the songs into Audacity and mute the vocals. THEN it would be a decent listen. Not Beck's best by FAR but if you could cut out the overly-precious Saffron, et. al. then it would be OK."
2,Overproduced Techno Mess,"If you are big Jeff Beck fan, there are moments of guitar brilliance on this new CD that you will enjoy. However, having to endure the samples and drum machine in order to hear those moments is difficult. Not to mention the songs themselves!!The album is a mess. The production is way off and the whole thing should have been scrapped.Jeff is such a great guitar player and over the years I have had to put up with terrible songs just to hear his playing. This latest release is just ridiculous."
3,Cool music with rough production,"It's already been said before, but the production on this album is bad. The drums on this album are purposely mixed ""hot"" and they sound like a distorted mess. Plan B and Pork-u-pine are cool songs but the drums are so distorted I can barely stand listening to them. I don't mind the use of sequencers and synthesizers like some do, but purposely distorting things doesn't do it for me.The positives are some of the songs that really catch my ear:""Plan B"" has a really spacey sound with a clean expressive lead riff. Pork-u-pine has this interesting use of samples with a lyrical lead. ""Line Dancing with Monkeys"" has a really mean riff and solo. ""JB's Blues"" and ""Pay Me No Mind"" are good. My favorite songs that sound like more traditional mellow JB songs are ""Bulgaria"" and ""Why Lord Oh Why?"". The last song sends chills down my spine it is so eerie and ethereal.I give this 4 stars for music, 2 stars for sound for an average of 3 stars."
3,J.B.'s guitar is lost in the noise!,"In Jeff's own words:""I don't think I've ever hated anything I've done more"".... Guitar Player, Sept 2003I must admit this isn't one of my favorites, I rank it with the likes of 'Flash' but still JB has the balls to explore and experiment! I would love to see a project with Terry Bozzio, Tony Levin and Tony Hymas... These guys could get Jeff's juices flowing in the proper direction, or should I say the direction I prefer... I've been a fan since 1975, so I'm more condusive to his Blues, Rock and Jazz Fusion sounds - guess I'm getting older... Just ordered 'Jeff Beck Live at BB King Blues Club' - I'll rate that after a spin or two..."
3,jeff by jeff beck,I was generally pleased with the product. However it was a bit different genre than I expected from Jeff Beck.
1,You Guys Actually Like This Sell-Out House Trash?,"I'm not sure what is worse; the new Jeff Beck CD or all the reviewers giving it 5 stars. Seriously, as I began listening to this CD in my car, my first reaction was to literally throw it out the window.What Jeff has done is taken his beautifully crafted, melodic songs and completely thrown them out in exchange for lifeless, uninspired, beat box-rap-house-hip hop crap. Whatever happened to the great drumming of Simon Phillips or Terry Bozzio? I'm not expecting ""Wired 2"" or ""Blow By Blow Redux."" Just something with some life to it.Sorry Jeff. I'm being generous and giving you 1 star and zero stars to all of the misguided reviewers who have forgotten (or never heard) Jeff Beck's masterpieces from the seventies. Say I'm stuck in the past but brilliant work is brilliant work - no matter how old it is."
3,Erm...,"... some nice playing in there, at times, but hardly tasty tunes. Solos alone do not an album make, and although the drum 'n bass and techno backdrops are all well and good, they just aren't very interesting. ""There and Back"" was the last great record Jeff produced, In My Humble Opinion. Great music and great musicians, and this is, I think, the 3rd album from Mr. Beck in as many years, where we were lucky to get one album per decade in the past. Clearly, the rent has been due, or he's preparing the old pension fund... I won't be buying the next one unless he's got some decent players in there. Must Try Harder."
1,"Disappointing, Indeed","Isn't it time for Jeff to find a new direction? This collection does continue in the vein of ""Who Else!"" and ""You Had it Coming"" but I found both of those to be more groundbreaking and enjoyable. I'm a big Jeff Beck fan and I like his propensity to push the edge, but he is subject to an occasional wrong turn. This CD is not so much a wrong turn as it is pointless. Move on to something else, Jeff. Please."
5,JEFF BECK IS THE MAN!,"WHAT CAN I SAY ABOUT THIS ALBUM,THIS IS GUITAR HEAVEN.NO ONE CAN REACH THE THE SAME SOUND JEFF BECK HAS.I PUT THE TECHNO BEATS BEHIND ME AND LISTEN TO THE GUITAR THAT NO ONE CAN PLAY LIKE JEFF AND WHAT I GET IT GREAT RHYTHEM AND WAH WAH PEDAL MASTERY AND SOLOS THAT SOUND LIKE EVERY NOTE YOU CAN HEAR CLEAR AS DAY."
1,Jeff Disappoints,"In my opinion, this trend of seeking new listeners and alienating existing ones started with Santana's ""Supernatural"", continued with Clapton's ""Reptile"", and now with Jeff Beck's ""Jeff"". Anyone hoping for a return to the ""Blow By Blow"" and ""Wired"" era will be extremely disappointed. If one could only separate the guitar tracks from the sampling and inane ""Yoko-like"" vocals, maybe there would be something listenable. For anyone seeking modern sounds from Jeff Beck, I highly recommend the soundtrack recording from ""Frankie's House""."
1,Save Your Money!,"First let me say that I'm a hugh Jeff Beck fan. I have all his cds. The last cd was pretty bad but this is pure noise. I can honestly say I couldn't get through this cd. It was starting to give me a headache. Beck plays real fast riffs against drum machines. There is all kind of stuff going on hear but none of it is music. Go back and listen to the Yardbirds, the Jeff Beck Group, Blow by Blow etc. Leave this one alone unless you lie noise that makes no sense what so ever. What was he thinking?"
1,The worst.......yet,"As much as I disliked ""Flash"", this is the absolute worst. I liked ""Who else"" and ""You had it coming"", but ""Jeff"" sounds like music that had been picked over from a scrap heap and put togetherjust to fulfill a lost bet or something. I can't believe a talent like Beck would allow this garbage to get out to the public. His first two albums are classics. His work with Tench andMiddleton were good. His jazz fusion period was sensational. Since then it's as if he's lost his direction. His live albums are always good, but Beck, do what you do best and quit trying toreinvent yourself. You only put out a couple albums every ten years, so please play some rock again."
5,AWESOME,Who wants to go to the Royal Albert Hall with me in June! If you are a true Jeff Beck fan then you'll hardly be able to contain yourself when you hear this music. God is playing through Jeff - no doubt about it.
4,Always changing,"Jeff Beck still relevant. I've got a fair bit of Becks music over the years, as well as most other notable guitarists like SRV, Tommy Bolin, Gary Moore, Steve Morse, Steve Howe, Robin Trower, Roberet Fripp etc. I think this CD and Who Else shows that Jeff Beck is still wanting to keep updating his techniques & styles after his more commercial successes of Blow by Blow, Wired, There & Back. This newer style is grungy, thick, techno or whatever but top notch as usual and I think proves that some of these older guys can show the younger, flashier jerks that they still have a long way to go to be mentioned in the same sentence as the legends. Worth adding this one to your collection, sound quality great and it's not even remasterd! (what a rip off some of these supposed remasters are, there are albums recorded properly 20 or more years ago, so why dont these remasters sound way better with the technology thats around)"
2,Too many dull ballads here!,"Freddie Jackson's Do Me Again is just too dull in most places. Most of the songs sound just like stuff from his 1985, 1986 and 1988 albums. Love Me Down sounds too 1985 to me, it's scary! And don't tell about the bland Do Me Again--it sounds so faceless and the music lacks feeling. Main Course sounds so cheesy and dinky sounding--did someone play that on some cheap $50 keyboards from some flea market? It Takes Two's pseudo-disco sound doesn't help either. But songs like Live For the Moment and Second Time For Love are okay and break away from the '80s similarities of his early hits. Do Me Again sounds so very complacent and stagnant, nothing new to break away from the pattern of his early hits. The Paul Laurence-produced songs are easily the worst that he's done for Freddie and the Barry Eastmond-produced efforts are missing something. I find his other albums far better than this piece of mediocre tripe!"
2,Rosebud Doll Cradle,"This arrived in pieces, and the holes in one piece did not correctly line up with the holes in the other piece. I finally replaced a few of the anchors they sent with better anchors I had on hand, and got the toy assembled. Way too much work for a doll cradle!"
2,cute but not sturdy,"This item was very cute once together but holes were not drilled in the correct areas making it difficult to screw together. It is not very durable as the rockers came off while my daughter was moving it from one side of the room to the other. If you do purchase it, I would recommend reinforcing the screwed in areas with a strong glue or brackets."
2,beautiful but rickety,This cradle is so beautiful and such care was taken with the cloth covering but the structure is totally rickety and we finally gave up fixing it over and over and threw it away.
1,Palm=gatbage,"BEWARE ... do NOT buy this or any palm handheld. I have had both an E2 and this LifeDrive and both have had loving care but both have died within a year . Palm will ""graciously"" repair it for $150 (plus shipping). so beware ... there is NO quality to be found here ... I suggest you look at a pocket pc or some OTHER device."
4,Good product,Had to buy because I didn't have a monitor for Dell This computer was given to me otherwise I would not buy a Dell Computer to hard to get replacement parts
4,Great learning tool!,"International Playthings Earlyears Soft Busy Blocks is a great learning tool. My daugher loved it, the texture, colors and sound are very innovative it truly captures your childs attention."
2,Better wash this toy before baby puts in mouth!!,"I was dismayed to find that this product reeked of fire retardants which took several washings and sitting outside in the sun for over a week to get rid of. When will makers of baby toys realize that these things go in baby's mouth and the chemicals that they put on them or that are on the fabric that are used to make these things are toxic? Many may not realize that the bromine that is in these fire retardants is toxic to the body and can cause thyroid issues among other problems. Unfortunately, it's in everything from car seats to crib bedding to these simple blocks. From now on I will pay the extra price and go for organic! Paying a little extra now is better than paying an outrageous hospital bill when your child develops an illness due to ingesting chemical after chemical in the toys and elsewhere."
5,Great early toy,"These blocks are great! They are colorful, lightweight and easy for a baby to grab. The different sounds each block makes are fun for my daughter to explore (though the squeak in the squeaky block can be difficult for a young child to locate) and I love that they are machine washable."
4,good 1st soft blocks!,"i really liked the colors that came on these blocks! my only complaint was that the material on one of them tore after washing the 1st time, i even made sure to follow the washing instructions. Other than than I really liked them even more so than the bright starts soft blocks!"
4,Great folk songs,"Laura Boosinger has a beautiful singing voice, and this album is filled with a great selection of songs. Some are funny, some are sad, all are fun to listen to and for singing along.Our son wants to listen to ""Bought me a Cat"" again and again, he really loves this album!"
4,Good not great,"I had no idea what to expect. When I see it, this is a good concert and nas is great.Negative -1) Not enough of whole songs, seems to just say 1st verse or chorus and move on. (especially on street dreams)2) Doesn't say enough, he raps for a few lines than takes a break!3) To much bravehearts, one guy in the background saying the last word to every line gets annoyingPositive -1) It's nas, good playlist,2) Ether is amazing!!!!3) puts a lot of heart into one mic4) Like how he went back to illmatic5) It's nasoverall this was good. i will watch this a lot."
3,Dissapointed,Iam a huge Nas fan he is my second favorite rapper only to 2PacThis concert had some classics on itSome of the songs where to short and he didnt even spit all of the versesTo me Nas seemed drunk or high in this concert because it always seemed as if he where out of breath and could not finish the verseIf you are a die hard Nas fan you buy this like me because you feel that you have to other than that I would not reccomend buying this dvd
5,The King Of New York,"This DVD is in one word brilliant. Nas show us why he is the greatest lyricist of all time. He plays songs from his last effort ""God's Son"". But also goes back in time when he drops jewels as ""The World Is Yours"", N.Y. State of Mind"", ""It Ain't Hard To Tell"", ""Nas Is Like"" & ""Got Urself A..."". You also see Nas drops his superb diss-record ""Ether"" for the first time in front of an audience. The 2 most impressive perfomances are ""One Mic"" (Nas gives his all in this song) and ""Made You look Remix"". The crowd goes wild on this track. There is also an intermissen where Darryl McDaniels (DMC) comes on stage for showing his love for Nas. This DVD is a must have for every fan of REAL HIP HOP. One love."
5,Nas-Real Hip Hop,"There are only a few MC's left in the rap game, and Nas is one! This concert, filmed live at a club in NYC, is hot! First, it's Nas, the bravehearts, and a few special guest (Ludacris, Jadakiss, DMC). Nas performs a number of his hits & a few songs I haven't heard before. Lyrically, Nas is easily top 3 in the rap game. Some of his songs should be used in schools to teach kids about our history. Just the fact that it's Nas with a mic & maybe one or two other cats with a mike on the stage & not 10 people with mikes screaming & not making any sense, make this concert one that can show those who don't know, what really hip hop is! No crazy lights, lasers, dancers, just a MC, DJ, turntable & a mike! DMC while a ICON, seems out of sort with his ranting!"
3,wish he would have rapped a whole song,"This dvd was cool because I love Nas but he should have rapped the whole songs. I would still recommend it if you love Nas like I do, it's worth it. Best rapper alive!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!"
1,Field tested?,These questions seem hodge podge. Are they comming from specific competencies and skills? Were they field tested? Where is the validity and reliability that if I take these sample test that it will in any way reflect how I do on the exam. These seem like fair questions. It seems like the publisher claims to produce study guides in almost every field. A real study guide has more than sample question tests times three. You really need content. The books I have seen are spiral bound and the typing seems to vary between book to book. There are also many type o's
5,Reads like a movie script,"I have been reading romance novels for over twenty five years and this is one of the best. The characters are deep and fully fleshed out and the story line is compelling. It is one of those books you read and can see it played out in your mind as a movie. The author came out with two other books after this that were equally satisfying but sadly I cannot say the same for her recent books as Susan Carroll. The complex relationship between Phaedra and James is realistic,simmering with anguish and sexual tension which leads to a revelation that only their love can over come. Please give this one a try and if you like it read Rendezvous, Escapade and the Painted Veil."
3,Not Too Memorable,"I've long been a fan of Galuppi, who usually gets short shrift from today's musical establishment. But sorry to say this occasional cantata honoring a newly appointed cardinal isn't one of his best efforts. Nothing wrong with it really, but nothing memorable either.The three soloists, sopranos Monika Gonzalez and Edit Karoly and tenor Tamas Kobor (they embody the new prelate's virtues of merit, humility and justice), are all capable of handling the florid vocal writing, but only Karoly seems to inhabit the spirit of the thing. Hungary's Savaria Baroque Orchestra, led by Fabio Pirona, does better. In fact the two orchestral tracks were the only sections I found really enjoyable, particularly the opening Sinfonia with its joyous clarino trumpets. Since these instruments were on hand, one wonders why Galuppi didn't find a place for them later in the cantata."
2,Pre-CSI,"Entertainer Steve Allen and his wife Jayne are on vacation when he gets contacted by his old friend Bobby Hamilton who is in Las Vegas doing a show. He wants Steve to come perform with him. And that is all you need to know about this book. Never have I seen a tale where the big arrow points so plainly to the murderer.Steve jets off to Sin City with his wife Jayne so he can prepare witn Bobby for a show. He meets Bobby's pathetic family: son, daughter, and second wife.80 pages in two people end up dead. Soon Bobby is accused of the murder and soon he is considered not guilty. Then, one of the suspects jumps to his death after somewhat confessing. But with that being on page 200 of 380 pages there must be more. And there is more.Cheat, lie, steal, video, and all the vice that a person can be involved with. Eventually Allen has everybody in a room where he deduces who the guilty party. I can not see myself reading another one of these."
5,Great message,"As a father of a 3-year old girl and another on the way, I'm concerned that our culture ""tells"" young girls that their worth is dependent on what other people think about how sexually attractive you are. But sports seems to be one way that women can feel good about their bodies without having to worry about what others think about how they look.At any rate, this book has become one of my favs because it helps my daughter learn about the ""true"" meaning of the term ""Princess"" apart from the Disney meaning of the word. That is, she can define herself according to her standards rather than someone else's."
5,The Six-Week Fab-to-Muscle Makeover,I read this book and followed all it's steps including the diet. It worked excellently. I lost inches. I was overweight by much but I needed a lot of toning. I wanted to have a waist. I was in the best physical shape ever after six weeks. I plan on doing the program again. Now after 2 children I need my shape back and I know for a fact following this program will give it to me.
3,too much on diet,this book is mostly abbout diet and not exercises. I was really turned off by that. not worth it.
3,She has succumbed...,"Why is it that when you find a really good historical romance writer, inevitably over time they lose their integrity and just start churning them out like a factory? I've been a *huge* fan of Susan Johnson's for over 10 years. I first read ""Sinful"" back in '97 and loved it so much, I read her entire back catalog. From that point on, whenever a new Susan Johnson book came out, I bought it straight up -- no need to read the synopsis on the back cover. Needless to say, I don't do that any more.This book was okay but not spectacular as so many of her books have been in the last few years. The characters are no longer realistic and this book is no exception. It's a fairytale for grown women -- Prince Charming will come in and save the damsel in distress. Unfortunately, you don't really care for the damsel or the prince.Do yourselves a favor -- check out her back catalogue when she actually used to do research for her novels and added footnotes and indices."
2,*DISAPPOINTED*,I was disappointed in this book. Too slow! I also think the cover is misleading. It looks contemporary not historical. I was bored. Hope this helps.
5,armstrong memories,THE MEMORIES OF LOUIS ARMSTRONG ARE SURELY HERE ON THIS FINE CHRIS CLIFTON CD.THE TRUMPET WORK AND VOCALS ARE AMAZING.LOVE IT!!!
3,Good for the Coupon,"This ""book"" by the president of Outskirts Press is nothing more than a nicely bound version of the publisher's guidelines, programs and options for their Print On Demand services. It is available in its entirety --at no cost-- at their web-site. There are 2 valid reasons to buy it however.(1) You get a $20 coupon at the back of the book to use toward one of their packages should you decide to publish with them. So the net savings is about $15(2) It is a relatively inexpensive way to see the quality of the books they publish -- the binding, the front & Back cover, etc.My recommendation is to go to their web-site and then if you're seriously considering publishing with them buy the book."
3,Self-Publishing Simplified,"I found it much harder to think about publishing a book than to write it. I had already bought five books about self-publishing and was getting more and more nervouse about what they finished product would look like. This slim book showed me what my own (also slim) book would look like and I breathed a sigh of relief. It also lined up all the various steps of publishing in an easy to understand format. This is the only book I know of where the discount offered ($20) exceeds the price of the book. By the way, I took the author up on his offer to oversee the whole process for me, and so far I'm very happy. Courteous staff, quick responses, helpful conversations. I'm very glad I bought this book. Jessie Coates author of BEING ABRAHAM"
4,"Muriel Jones Hines, Author of Inspirational Readings with Ole School Song Titles",Never did I think that my dream would become a reality... Thanks Outskirts Press for a job well done!
2,Like reading an infomercial,"If you want to know how to self-publish a book with Outskirt Press, and you're too lazy to get the information from their website, this is the book for you. I expected more on the nuts and bolts of self publishing; after all, the title does lead one to think this. Oh well. On the plus side, it wasn't too expensive."
5,Self publishing simplified,"I would recommend this book, to who wants to publish a book. This book helped me publish my first book, it will help you to if you want to publish a book.If you want to publish a book, I would recommend that you go through this publisher. They helped me and they can help you too. I have just completed a book called ""Enduring Journey"" through this company it is about a woman, who is going to have a baby, and finds out that she is being abused, so she leaves him and tries to find herself, but find love instead, check it out!"
2,Outdated...But Take A Look At His New Book,"As someone who has self-published over 30 books, I can honestly say that this book is not worth reading, but don't downgrade the author based on this offering. Take a look at his new book: ""Sell Your Book On Amazon"", that one is worth your time and money. Don't waste your money on this title, but don't try to self-publish without reading one or two of the newer books on the market (including his). Enjoy!Todd HagopianPresident/CEOHagopian InstituteAuthor of the brand new book - Self Publisher Coach: ""Sell More Books In 30 Days"" Edition"
1,Poor Poor POOR!,"This isn't a helpful guide, it is a sales pitch by the self-publishing company who wrote it. Save your money and buy ""The Fine Print of Self-Publishing""."
3,BLACK GOLD GRAY by Richard D. Rosenblatt & George M. Crall,"We don't need this book and haven't read it because we have already published BLACK GOLD GRAY and had an overwhelming success. Read BLACK GOLD GRAY, which has been called ""..the best war novel of this century..""..You can buy it at Barnes & Noble Internet, or Amazon, or Target.Hardcover or paperback..Published by Maximilian Books of Washington, D.C.Watch for the motion picture and Video Game under ""Rescue the General"".Don't be fooled by imitations. Look for the Black star on the cover. And,don't read the exciting ending before you finish the book. If you are caught you'll be punished..."
4,Very good guidance to Microeconomic Principle,"Reading through this book, I could understand the mathematic tools of microeconomics. The explanation is so clear that the average students who studied the principle of economics can understand what the author tried to explain. Very nice book. I recommend this book to every student who wants to understand microeconomics by mathematic methods."
3,A good introduction into microeconomic theory,"This book gives an overview of microeconomic theory. It also provides some mathematical background, which is not very extensive. The author takes his time in covering a subject, which can be a little irritating. This, however makes reading the book easier. The greatest flaw is the very small part of the book dedicated to game theory. This is a very important part of modern microeconomic theory, which in my opinion deserves a bigger coverage."
5,Fun to read along with your children.,"My seven year old and 4 year old delight in the whimsical and silly ryhming. We love it once, we love it twice. We love Chicken soup with rice!"
1,awesome book poor size,This is one of the best children's books ever written but it is a mini version of the book and was not portrayed as one. It is over priced for the product. I sent an email regarding my bewilderment to Amazon and got no response.
3,"Love the book, unhappy with the size!",I should have read the description carefully. I bought the book for my two year old as a Christmas gift. It is very small and the print quality isn't very good. I am going to put it in her stocking. I wish I would have looked more at the description. This was way over priced for the size.
4,Just a little research,I noticed a couple of reviews commenting on the size of the book. Apparently they were surprised at the small size. This is the original size published from the Nutshell Library. It is a very popular book for small children who love little things. I am a school librarian and little books are loved in our library.
3,Disappointed,"When I ordered a large amount of these books to share with child care providers, I was greatly disappointed in what arrived for the amount I paid. I was expecting a larger book, not the 4x5 inch book that was delivered. It looked like something that was created off of a copy machine."
3,Size does matter,"This book was purchased to be used in a classroom setting for read-a-loud purposes. The small size of the book(4X6)makes that almost impossible. The book itself is very cute and flows nicely, but is best shared with only one child at a time."
4,"Love the book, miss the hard cover version","I grew up reading these Sendak books, and watching the Really Rosie movie that incorporates them, and love them. My son loves them too. I do however, miss the hard cover version. The paperbacks seem kind of flimsy and it takes two hands to keep the pages open."
4,chicken soup with rice months,This is a fun way for children to learn their months of the year! We will learn all of the poems throughout the school year. they like the handmotions which I invent for each poem.
3,Too Small,"The story and drawings by Maurice Sendak are wonderful as expected. However, the size is very disappointing, especially for the cost and shipping costs ($3.99). It could probably have been covered under one postage stamp. There was no reason to believe I should confirm the size of the book, or even read reviews prior to ordering, as all books I've received from Amazon have been within a normal size range and pretty much what I expected. When I researched, after I received the tiny package, I did realize that the measurements are noted in the description, and the only negative reviews are about the size. So being this IS such an unusual size, I would just suggest that Amazon, and all sellers, clearly provide the measurements, up front, just as an added courtesy."
5,love this book,"Great book, perfect condition arrived in a short amount of time, long before the expected delivery date"
4,Children will find it entertaining and a generator of giggles,"This book contains a collection of twelve short statements, all of which end with the phrase ""Chicken Soup with Rice."" Each one is based on a month of the year and they have some elements of nonsense verse. For that reason, children will find them entertaining and they will generate a few giggles."
5,This tape is a great accompainment to the book!!!,The tape goes along with the book and keeps kids jiving to the music. My class of first graders loved it. It was the first tape that they requested when we were doing music. They knew the songs by heart and learned the poems very quickly. I would recommend it for anybody!
1,"The story is great, the softcover book is disappointing","I give five stars to the Maurice Sendak story. One star for this printed edition of the book.My children had an older copy this book, so I was very familiar with the previous softcover version. I ordered this for my granddaughters, but I'm embarrassed to give it as a gift, it looks so puny. The book is about the size of a postcard and I think it's overpriced. I've learned my lesson: I will not be buying any more softcover children books, next time I'll get a used copy."
5,Great!,"Ms. Moore is very educated and smart. I love reading her books and the information is wonderful and you can find it no other place out there as very few have the knowledge. She is a caring, compasionate woman and I have learned much from reading her books. They have been a lifesaver to me. Thank you for her books."
5,Thyroid Eye Disease: Understanding Graves' Opthalmopathy,"This book is by far the most comprehensive, and yet understandable for the patient, that I have read on this topic. It has been invaluable to prepare me not only for communicating with my ophthamologist, but also for identifying complementary approaches that have greatly relieved my symptoms. The book serves as an important guide as my disease progresses which allows me to handle each difficult symptom intelligently. Wouldn't be without it!"
1,high and dry,I never received this book. The seller warned me (too late) that it would be taking longer than normal because of the method they were using to mail. Then....nothing. I should have had a big red flag raised at the very moment of my ordering... giving me a larger opportunity to cancel before it was too late. VERY disappointed in the seller and the unwanted annoyance caused by this rinkie dinkie book.
3,Collection of poems about nature and the wild,"An anthology of poetry and black-and-white photographs focusing on the natural world. The book is divided into sections based on biospheres - the shore, the mountains, the prairie, etc. Includes poems by Dylan Thomas, Randall Jarrell, Maxine Kumin, Ted Hughes, Theodore Roethke, Walt Whitman, Galway Kinnell, Adrien Stoutenburg, William Stafford, Lew Sarett, William J. Smith, Robert Frost, Eve Merriam, and others."
3,"Good pictures, so-so advice on compatibility of fish...","This book has lots of ideas for both salt and freshwater aquariums. On the down side the common names of the fish were UK names, and because we live in the US we had some trouble trying to identify what the American counterparts were. Some of the advice the author gave on suitable tank-mates turned out to be poor because of the conditions the various fish need (water quality, how agressive the fish were, etc.). I liked looking at it, but wouldn't recommend making this the only book you trust for fish buying advice."
4,Complete Aquarium,This is an usual book compared to many of the others I have read recently but I like it. It contains many beautiful pictures of aquarium setups with step by step directions on producing the finished product. The various aquariums are representative of different habitats all over the world. It is a joy to look through even though you may not be creating a new aquarium.
4,Eye & mind candy,"This is a fine book, it has detailed information on water conditions for different fish, good lists of fish, and a natural approach to running an aquarium. Beautiful pictures, it is true that they just list fish and general characteristics. They combine fish that I know don't get along. Really a great idea book and gets you started creating a natural habitat for you fishies. This book is a ""MUST HAVE"" for anyone."
3,I Should have saved my money,This wasnt the type of book for a newbie if you just wanted to know about fish. This is more of a HOW TO book for setting up different types of tanks. I guess it would be a great book if you were really deep into fish other than just wanting a nice community tank that looks nice and the fish wont eat each other.
4,A timeless story of overcoming inter-personal conflicts.,"This novel of Ozick's deals with the constant struggle of achieving perfection. The main character, Joseph, is a Jewish-Frenchman living in the middle of America. He had faced many hardships during the first decades of his life. When he finally is able to overcome them and enjoy the blessings of his emancipation, he cannot let go of his own sense of failure. The relationships he has in the latter part of his life are not fufilling because he focuses on the lack in these people, not thier ability. Joseph fails to value people as individuals. As a result, he is destined to be ordinary and unhappy instead of trying to be extraordinary. At the end of the novel he is given a chance to change his outlook on life. This novel was an easy read and full of beautiful, descriptive imagery."
2,I would have liked Ozick to be in the room with me...,". . . Yes, the novel is well written, and Ms. Ozick certainly has a highly developed vocabulary... or at least she has access to a good thesaurus. . . .The main point of the book is that while some of us dream, strive and struggle for intellectual greatness, we usually wind up being just a bunch of ordinary folks. How silly, how depressing! What unrealistic, high falootin' ideas of greatness this woman has! She illustrates her idea of ordinariness by telling us that unless we're great we're doomed to be mere ""plumbers"". Don't plumbers think? She never passes up a chance to heft her great intellectual superiority complex on the lower forms of life that she and, apparantly, her characters are destined to rub elbows with.I found Ozick's tone infuriatingly patronizing and false. What all the hubbub about her is all about, I'll never understand."
2,KINGSTON TRIO,The music was fine but the sound level was barely audible. I thought it may have been my player so I tried the CD on another with the same results.
5,All the top songs of the Kingston Trio,"If you want one album of songs sung by the Kingston Trio, this is the one. It includes most of their greatest hits plus some sleepers I'd forgotten about. These guys were the pioneers of folk groups and you won't be disappointed in this album or their music."
2,A Deeply Sleeping Beauty,"An earnest effort that maybe takes itself too seriously. Lacks the humor, grace, and deft touches of the more recent Royal Ballet staging with CojocaruTchaikovsky: The Sleeping Beauty (The Royal Ballet), not to mention the brilliant clarity and rich color of the Blu-Ray disc. I find the pace sluggish (has classical ballet conducting slowed down in recent years?). The dancing of the corps de ballet and the principals is only average. The non-dancing Lilac Fairy of the original production is certainly historically authentic, but I miss the lively dancing Lilac that soon replaced her. Almost any Russian production from Bolshoi or Kirov/Mariinsky gives me more pleasure (and brisker tempos).To me the sets are ponderous and dark, and the voluminous costumes--well, the performers look more upholstered than costumed. I could swear there's a Balinese or Indonesian influence in the ballerinas' headdresses--beautiful but a bit incongruous. Will not watch this disc a second time."
3,user review,"have downloaded version of cowon jet audio plus, you can rip cds and stream on internet by creating your own virtual radio station, listen to internet radio, burn cds, user friendly no real problems so far"
5,Best Diet Motivation Book Available!,"This is the best book EVER for daily motivation to stick with your diet, or weight-management program, even better that the books put out by Over-Easters Anonymous. I have used this book many times, over a number of years, and continue to be motivated again EVERY TIME I read it.The book is filled with specific, concrete suggestions of new ideas to try to keep yourself motivated, and sticking to your program. It gives new, specific things to consider and work on that are REALLY USEFUL, unlike many other books."
3,Love Steven Seagal....can't watch this series,"The EDTING of this series is REALLY REALLY BAD! It jumps to fast from one camera to another, if you suffer from ADT you'd be ok, but it's just bad editing. I guess this is the new trend, I see so many new Music DVD's being done this way. I dont know if it's to try to keep your attention but constantly moving from one angle to the next, then you have the camera's simulate movement by shaking and slo-mo style moving...blah! His movies are great and well edited. This show would be great but for the cheap editing job."
2,no good,It downloaded good but didn't play well at all. This was one purchase that wasn't worth it. Unless they work better on the product I don't recommend buying it@
3,Didn't Perform as Dog Trimmer,"After speaking to a barber supply, decided to try the Oster MiniMax as a trimming tool on my Airedale terrier - mostly looking for something to trim the fur between the pads of her feet. Worked well on very fine hairs under her ears, but elsewhere it just wouldn't cut well. Have used and like other Oster clippers, but this one, surprisingly, couldn't perform even light-weight dog grooming jobs."
3,Oster Mini Max Trimmer,"The Oster Mini Max Trimmer is a good Trimmer. However, I thought that it was suppose to be quiet for use around the head and ears. My Dog did not like it to be used around the head and ears as it was too loud and vibrated too much even thought it had been oiled prior to use. It was good for trimming other parts though."
1,did not last the first cut.,I bought these clippers to do finish work around my Standard Poodles' paws. The clippers stopped running before I finished the first cut. Oster is supposed to be a good brand but these clippers did not make the cut. Do not recommend them. I hope to get my money back.
2,Keep looking,"I like Oster trimmers and I do use this one, but I don't recommend it. It's too small, doesn't cover enough area and overheats a bit. You can find a better one for this price."
2,Out of date before it was written!,"This book certainly has some value in the ongoing discussion of language acquisition. However, it must be noted that most of the criticisms of Krashen's theories leveled in the book had already been addressed by Dr. Krashen before this volume was even published. The contributors do not quote anything he had written in the last three to four years before this publication."
2,A word of warning,"I just thought maybe someone should explain that this book is explicit in describing the sexual escapades that take place.I was taken by surprise, and very glad I had not bought it for my niece to read. When I tell you it is explicit - I do mean explicit. You not only know sex is taking place - you know every move made and how it feels to what parts.So - for those who 'get off' on this kind of thing, heres a book for you.For those looking for a 'horse book' minus the bodice ripper aspects - skip this one.Personally, I found the people to be haughty, selfish, crude and rude. Not at all likeable persons. I need to like the characters in a book if I am going to enjoy it. For me - the bits and pieces about the horses weren't enough to make up for the horrible people found in these pages.If this is what the blessed, blooded horse, High Life is like - then I can truly say I'm glad to have been spared such blessings."
2,"Fun, but unnecessarily graphic...","Meh. The first half of the book read like a Harlequin romance novel, only those are better written. I plugged on through because I loved the horsey bits, but then it started picking up the latter half and then I was hooked. If the author could stop using sentence fragments and leave out about 90% of the sex details, this would be a GREAT summer read. I wish that authors who wrote about horses understood that you do NOT need explicit sexual details to make a good story."
3,Engaging story but...,"This book had an engaging story however the author delighted in using curse words liberally throughout the entire book. The main character seems too unbelievable as well, a superman who women throw themselves at constantly. That theme got rather tiresome after a while. So between the cursing and the sexual excess this makes a book that may entertain some people but turn off a great many more. Would I recommend it, no probably not."
3,"Nice looking, but too small in height","Although this item came with all the extras, I think that the size of the ball is too low. Would like it to have been larger."
3,Hoped I could use this ball at my desk but it didn't work out.,"I was hoping that, with the stand, I would be able to sit on this ball at my desk, swapping it out for my desk chair periodically. However, the stand is not tall enough to bring the ball to the right height. So, instead, I gave the ball to my daughter-in-law and she used it during her at-home birth. Turns out these balls are great for sitting on while having contractions!!"
2,disappointing,"I am not sure that the story was built around the sexual encounters or about the three getting together as a single powerful force. If it is the latter, well, I found the story lacking in intrigue and action. I would have rated a one if it were the case. I found the sexual encounters were too elaborate and occured to often and distracted from the story line. One good thing about the book is that I never read a ""sex"" book before. Now I know. Definitely not going to book 2. Not my style."
5,Triad,"Having never read any book by her I bought this book on a whim. The blurb actually caught my eye. And I was definitely NOT disappointed. It had a truly great story with lots and lots of interesting interaction not only between the primary characters but also with the secondary characters. It has it all action, romance and the sex scenes are rocking. You get a yummy vamp and sexy wizard both. Lee is a very very lucky lady. And this book is one great read. But it you won't be disappointed"
1,disappointing,"I was hoping for more of a Paranormal triad of power. The sex scenes were too much, story sounded intriguing, but a bad guy (devil like) named Angra...really? Kept hoping for more character development and more challenging scenes. The magical scenes were like a paragraph to defeat an enemy...the sex was pages...come on....Won't be reading #2."
4,The whole package,"This book has it all. Interesting characters, a well written and fully developed plot, sensual yet hot and spicy sex scenes coupled with the paranormal. It is a refreshing change from all the new un-finished works so many others are publishing now days I can't wait to read the rest of the series."
5,Excellently Steamy...,"This book was such a wonderful read. Tastefully erotic. Lusciously sensual. I enjoyed reading about the love triangle between the three main characters. I could almost 'feel' their bond. The book was so well-written, I felt as if I was literally there, watching it all take place. From start to finish, this book was a treat. And then some..."
1,not what i expected,"liked the basic story, would have liked to see more build up on the characters. i definitely could do withoutthe crude,gutter trash sex scenes and words. I don""t mind sex scenes, just didn't like the language. Ithink the author would have been better to spend less time on the sex, and more developing the history andthe characters."
2,"Not bad, just a bit boring","I was excited when I saw this book on my Amazon recommendations. How could I not love a story about a vampire, a witch and a warlock? However, I found I didn't much care about the characters, the sex was only mediocre and the plot never pulled me in enough that I cared to finish the book. It wasn't a bad book, it just did nothing for me."
1,Bad bad bad,This book was badly written and the sex was ridiculousGo back to your old job and stop what you consider writingThere are ways of writing of sex without being vulgar
3,*TRIAD*,"This book was okay. NOT true to life in just about every sense. I kept thinking ""yeah right"". Which is unfortunate but come on...guys just aren't that accomodating and more power to you if you've found one! Nice story but way to slow. I kept waiting for the third character to enter into action. Well it takes forever! To many details in the story and not enough ""get on with it""."
4,"small, but works great","I bought this for my 7 year old daughter to give a little sound without blowing the house away. It's perfect. You can really tell when the batteries are going dead, because it will put out an unbearable screech. So put aside the batteries they give you and put in some that you know are fresh. Otherwise, was great!"
1,Not the real original recordings.,"I don't know what ""master tapes"" these recording came from but for sure they ain't the ones from the early 60's. These are NOT original recordings. They are good quality but I wanted the real stuff not some remastered and edited sound a-likes. I'll look for another CD."
4,The Best of Bobby Vee,"I love all oldie, when i was teenage i have heard his song and i cannot forget his voice. i had been search his album and i cannot find it until now. i will recommond my friend to your web site to find their loverly song which they are missing"
3,incorrect track listings,"I agree with Bradley in regards to the quality of the cd, but the track listings on my copy are definitly wrong and in some cases different as stated in another revue. At some point the producer saw fit to edit this cd."
1,nose clips for swimming,The mailing cost was too high for such a small item. I have sent bigger items on ebay via media mail.
4,Good,Works good for keeping water out of your nose. Does slide off sometimes if your nose area is oily.
4,Lap swimmer plugs,I bought this plug for practicing my kayak roll at a local pool. They are fine for that. The price is right. I will buy a sturdier plug for use on the river.
1,Too much science talk,Didn't realize the extent of the philosophical dive this book would take. Finally got to the meat of the title in the last chapter. Only finished it because I had paid for it.
3,Daughter not totally jazzed over,"Bought this for our three year old....she plays with it seldom.....mostly just uses to put things on...ie, babies and stuffed animals- just okay-"
1,Karla Faye Tucker knew how to put on the sweet girl act.,"Before I read this book I had mixed feelings about Karla Faye Tucker being put to death. After reading the book I think it was the only thing that could be done. She was a dangerous monster. Beverly Lowery told how Karla Faye would smile and as she talked about her travels with the Allman Brothers Band. I believe Karla Faye would have loved to be back in her old life style. Being locked up she done what was necessary to get the attention, putting on this 'Born Again' act. It got her by and almost got her free. This was an evil person that was proud of what she had done,or as she said ""I don't know what it was that I done"". I hate the death penalty but what can you do with a person like her? She would have killed again, with out a doubt."
2,Someone write about her victims,"The author seemed all too willing to forget what Ms. Tucker did. No matter how ""rehabilitated"" a murderer claims to be or how much they claim to to have ""changed"", that does not bring back their victim(s).(I feel sorry for Richard Thornton's loss, but what was his wife Deborah doing in another man's apartment in the middle of the night. I don't think I would mourn the loss of a spouse who cheated on me. I also cannot believe how the victims' siblings could buy her act and forgive her.)Question: would Pat Robertson have plead for the life of a murderer who'd ""converted"" to Judaism or <gasp!> Islam?"
2,True Crime Memoir of a Pick Ax Murderer,"This book, in the true crime genre, is about a female pick ax murderer on death row. It is a biographical retrospective from a psychological perspective and examines Karla's early involvement with hard drugs, her upbringing by a drug addicted and prostitute mother and other environmental influences.The author juxtaposes a memoir or her son who was recently killed in a hit-run accident. He, too, was a 'child-gone-bad' - - skirmishes with the law, school drop-out. ""There but for fortune""......she thinks.Though interesting, this book misses the boat. Karla has become 'decent' - - a christian, caring woman. However, I ended the book still thinking, 'Who is she?', and ultimately, 'so what!'. Perhaps, being of the mindset that reality rests as much in behavior as thought, I did not find Lowry's analysis of events convincing or cohesive."
1,Cross this one out,"Ecchh. I really thought I was going to enjoy this book. However, it didn't take too many pages to realize I would never finish it. I do feel for the author and could get a sense of her horrible pain over her son's death. I think I would have rather read about that and just left Karla Faye Tucker out of the whole thing. I just couldn't empathize with her story. Hard childhood, blah blah, blah. I am ambivalent towards capital punishment but here I felt no pain for Ms. Tucker or her family. I saw the female victim's (Townsend) husband on TV and he pointed out that no one commuted her death sentence so eye for an eye. Not really recommended."
1,"Untruth after untruth, this should be science fiction!","As one of the people who is intimately involved in the case that this literary piece is supposed to be realistically portraying, I am surprised that anyone could believe that any of this actually happened the way the author portrays it. The convicted murderer is shown as being a wonderful person. I have not met too many ""wonderful"" people who are capable of swinging a pick axe into two different people more than 60 different times and enjoying it so much that they told several people that they had a sexual orgasm with each swing. That is sick. This was not an isolated incident; within a day after the first two murders, this individual was planning several more murders which would have been carried out if she had not been apprehended. She had no religion and no remorse until AFTER she was in jail. The reason I know all this? Tucker murdered my wife, Deborah Ruth Thornton. Don't waste your money on this trash."
3,Acting With an Accent Spanish,I think this book was great. Just great. It really helps people with spanish accents. It tells you how to get rid off them and it does it quick and easy. This book tells you step by step how to pronounce words. This book also tells you the most common mistakes people make trying to speak the english language. THIS BOOK IS A MUST HAVE!!! :)
4,A fantastic album,"When my amazon.com package arrived, I ripped it open and put this album on. By the time I got to the second track, ""Freetime"" I noticed that my head was nodding to the music uncontrollably. Then, by the time I got half-way through the third track, ""Man Fading"", a full fledged dance party had broken out in my apartment. The only drawback was that I was the only one dancing. Nonetheless, ""New Sacred Cow"" is a great album that immediately demands your attention. It is filled with crafty songs that will keep your head bobbing and make you wonder why you've never heard of Kenna before. There are also a few more laid back songs with a more mellow tone that provide a perfect balance to the album. Overall, a fantastic album."
4,It's Depeche Mode combined with Seal and Tricky -- buy it!!!,"Admit it. Depeche Mode went crazy after Violator. Songs of Faith and Devotion was OK, and Ultra was ... except for Home. And anyone who bought their last album was living on dreams. DM has lost it and I've been looking for a fix ever since. Kenna is it. As an aside, I note that some of the other reviews have noted that Kenna was on M2 last year. I live in the Washington, DC suburbs and I CAN'T GET M2! What the hell is that about!? If anybody knows anybody in Cox Cable, I need some damn help with this. Anyway, Kenna. DM meets Tricky. Kenna channels everything you love about DM, Erasure, George Michael and Duran Duran into one excellent album. If I made records, this is exactly what I'd want to make. What will I do now? I know, listen to Kenna again."
2,Interesting,"It was interesting. The lyrics are very goods. Music is good, but I really didn't want to listen to it more than twice. I like Thicke and Postal Service more. They are the tyoe of new band that I can listen to over and over again, and enjoy it more each time."
4,Take that boring [...] out of your cd player!,"A friend of mine introduced me to Kenna, and I was a bit skeptical at first...but now I haven't been able to take him out of my CD player! With Chase Chad (Chad Hugo from the Neptunes/NERD) doing most of the production, Kenna really shines with his electronically styled album. He doesn't fit into a typical mold or genre and I really like that. The lyrics are also brilliant, making you laugh, cry, or just think. My favorite songs are: ""Redman"", ""Vexed and Glorious"", ""Free Time"", and ""I'm Gone""."
4,A bit too technical for me,I was just looking for a layman's book on schizophrenia. This one is just too technical for me.
4,guider to Schizoprenia,it is a good book for the new person who want to start to get know more about Schizophrenia.
2,Flimsy and not well made,"We got this for my daughter for her birthday. The items is not very sturdy at all and broke before we had it all together. The anchors(?) came out of the wood. The bottom screw holes would not line up with the pre drilled holes on the bottom of the cradle. There is no support at all to this thing. I expected a little bit construction, but I got what I paid for. I did contact the company and they are sending out new parts. They did not seem to care that they are selling a bad product."
2,The cradle did not come with all of the parts,The cradle was a Christmas gift for my daughter and as of Jan. 9th it is still not put togeather because we did not have all of the parts.
2,The cradle broke,"I bought this as a gift for my 2 yr old niece. One of the rods broke the FIRST day. So, my very busy sister had to get online and order another piece. Not cool.I'd read on another review that the cradle broke, but thought maybe it was an isolated incident. Now, I'm a believer. I do not recommend this product - at all!"
2,"My daughter loves it, but hard to keep side walls up","We got this as a gift a few years ago when our daughter was 4. She is now 6 and still plays with it. The fabric side walls don't stay up especially when my daughter wants to move/arrange the cradle in her room. It is frustrating; however my daughter loves this cradle and insists that it sit right next to her bed with her baby in it every night. I believe a piece came apart on it, but it was a quick fix and it has held together through the couple years of abuse. We are now considering buying another for our 3 year old so they'll have matching baby cradles for the American Girl Bitty Babies Santa is bringing them for Christmas this year."
2,A dated classic,"Anyone familiar with the growing oevre of Mahler biographies must have come across Adorno's now-classic work. Long considered the authoritative analysis of Mahler's psyche, next to Bruno Walter's first-hand account, this work has not aged well. Clogged with psychoanalytic jargon - yet strangely devoid of the details of Mahler's brief analysis with Freud himself - and weak on the facts, this book should be eclipsed by the far more informative, objective accounts of Mahler's life that have appeared in recent years. Carr's superb volume comes to mind."
2,"The writing can be forced, juvenile","I am about 50 pages into this book, and will not be continuing the read. There have been enough instances in this book so far where the quality of the writing just makes you cringe.....I am copying here a book excerpt that Kirkus Reviews used:`She wept, burying her face against his designer shirt. She had a great ache, in her belly, in her heart. She had lost her father.'' (Then comes a sex scene.)The sex scenes are not why I won't finish the book - it is the writing. It starts to make you wonder if the book was written/published just to deliver the sex scenes."
5,WOW!!!,"Dont know the author that well,bought it at shop down the streets and I give a go and I am hook!!!Sad that there are not much books from this author."
1,mis advertised,"This was advertised to work with the mac os, it doesn't. The disk doesn't even say it is mac os compatable. I have used there products before on pcs and they work great. False advertising!"
1,Product was incorrhctly adverhised,"I gave the seller a negative rating becuse the listing said the product could be used with Windows, Mac or Liux. I discovered when I received it that, like the older version I had, it will work only with Windows, which I no longer use. Furthermore, if I ran it with Windows XP, I couldn't print the checks because XP won't drive a USB printer. I am currently working on installig a Linux-specific program. I regret having rated the vendor negatively because he said he didn't claim VersaCheck works with Linux or Mac; someone at Amazon must have ""enhanced"" his copt without researching the claim he er she made. This has reflected badly on Awazon, and meais thah the vendor'r negative rating should be rescinded."
2,Good in Theory,"The messages in this book cannot be faulted: treat your child with respect and teach self control. The prequel, ""Raising Your Spirited Child"", teaches parents to first adjust to their child's temperament and is quite good. Much of content is repeated in this book. The disadvantage of this book is that the messages get lost in the overly abundant stories used to humanize and illustrate behavioral points. And all have simple causes and neat conclusions. Reading was slow and not particularly beneficial. For a parenting book that better addresses common problems, common responses and better responses, read ""How to Talk to Your Child"". However, there's still the need for a book that addresses how to handle situations where time doesn't allow diplomacy or diplomacy doesn't yield results."
